hernia repair can relieve pain from conditions other than groin hernias, such as \"sports groin.\" The aim of this study was to assess the nationwide frequency of surgically treated sports groins and identify conditions found during groin hernia surgery with no hernia present. In this nationwide cohort study, we included patients with no hernia found during groin hernia repair. Patients were identified in the nationwide Danish Hernia Database. Outcomes were assessed from medical and surgical records. Medical history, preoperative examinations, and operative details were extracted. Data from 259 patients were included. Of these, 152 (58%) were considered to have a sports groin. A weak posterior inguinal wall was identified in 41 sports groins, a wide profound inguinal ring in 10, and no specific anatomic pathology was described in the remaining patients with a sports groin. A lipoma was found in addition to a sports groin in 60 patients. Findings in patients without a sports groin were predominantly lipomas, and less frequent findings were a cyst and hydrocele. More than half of the patients were assessed to have a sports groin. Frequent findings that co-existed with a sports groin were weak posterior inguinal wall and\/or lipoma. ","1":"Chronic, non-healing wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers, have a significant economic impact on healthcare and are associated with elevated patient morbidity. Among the toolset of treatment options available to clinicians, skin grafts from other species (xenografts) are often used to promote wound closure. While porcine xenografts have been the most used skin xenograft over the years, acellular fish skin grafts from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) have steadily gained traction in usage. Unlike other skin grafts, acellular fish skin grafts have a substantial lipid profile primarily composed of omega-3 fatty acids, notably eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fish oil supplementation has been shown to result in faster rates of wound epithelialization, and omega 3 fatty acids provide barrier protection against bacteria and alter the inflammatory profile of wounds. EPA and DHA have been shown to have modulatory effects on the progression of wound healing. These characteristic omega-3 fatty acids and their metabolites alter skin physiology at a cellular and molecular level. Clinically, fish skin grafts continually demonstrate increased efficacy in treatment of wounds. When applied to non-responsive diabetic foot ulcers, acellular fish skin grafts have resulted in accelerated healing rates and significantly more fully healed wounds when compared to standard options. Here, we explore the role of omega-3 fatty acids in wound regeneration and repair, with particular focus on EPA and DHA. Then, we review clinical research outcomes to address notable clinical research studies and highlight the therapeutic potential of fish skin grafts with omega-3 as a treatment for chronic, non-healing wounds.","2":"Periarticular multimodal analgesic injection associates with less postoperative (post-op) pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with less opioid consumption. The combination of additives and dosage are various and controversial. Evidence of ketorolac compared to triamcinolone as an additive is limited in terms of efficacy and safety. Fifty-six patients with unilateral TKA were randomized to receive either 60mg ketorolac or 80mg triamcinolone acetonide as cocktail additives in periarticular injection. Significant threshold was considered if the adjusted mean difference of morphine consumption was greater than 3mg at any timepoint. The primary outcomes were morphine consumptions at immediate post-op, 24 hour (h), 48h, and 72h post-op. Pain visual analogue scale (VAS), knee range of motion, straight leg raising ability, and adverse events were secondary outcomes. Adjusted mean differences (ketorolac-triamcinolone) in morphine consumption were -0.4, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.3mg at given timepoints without significance. No difference observed in pain VAS at rest and during motion, post-op knee extension, and straight leg raising ability. However, post-op knee flexion was significantly higher in triamcinolone group at any timepoints (mean differences 10.3, 10.6, and 9.7, respectively, p&lt;0.05). Periarticular analgesic injection containing 60mg ketorolac provided similar analgesic efficacy and early functional recovery compared with 80mg triamcinolone acetonide. However, triamcinolone may benefit over ketorolac in early post-op knee flexion. ","3":"It has been well-established that obesity, or the fat content of the belly, is associated with diabetes, heart conditions, metabolic syndrome and back pain. With regard to back pain, this study aimed to assess the forces that incremental amounts of belly fat exert on the spine. A finite element analysis (FEA) was performed with a 3D CAD model of the spine using data for various populations from the Dallas Heart Study. There were significant differences in the forces exerted on the spine by belly fat among ethnic groups. These findings should help clarify the stress forces experienced by the spine in relation to waist circumference and could help to explain the association between obesity and back pain. ","4":"Adhesions can cause symptoms of pelvic pain, infertility, and bowel obstruction in reproductive and postmenopausal women. The topic of adhesiolysis and adhesion barriers in gynecology has been studied in small, heterogeneous studies with very low to moderate quality. The efficacy for prevention and treatment strategies of adhesive disease in the gynecologic population will be reviewed here.","5":"Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) leak in cranial and spinal surgery seriously threatens the clinical prognosis of surgical cases exposing the patients to higher risk of infection, prolonged hospital stay, and need of reoperation. Ultimately, this cascade of events may lead to life-threatening complications, as in cases of meningitis\/encephalitis, spondylodiscitis, subdural hematomas, and severe pneumocephalus. Moreover, CSF leak causes a consistent rise in healthcare-related costs which are nearly doubled in CSF leak cases after craniotomy or in spinal surgery. The risk of CSF leak tends to be higher in patients undergoing transnasal endoscopic surgery, posterior fossa craniotomies, and spinal surgery, while being considered a quite rare finding in supratentorial brain surgery. Here we analyzed the different implications of this issue focusing on the usefulness of new technologies and surgical strategies to prevent it. CSF leak rate may vary from 4% in transsphenoidal procedures to 32% in posterior fossa craniotomies. In spinal surgery, CSF leak may be a consequence of elective intradural surgery, accounting for 18% of the procedures, or being a result of incidental durotomies, ranging from 1 to 17% in different surgical series. Dural closure's reinforcement using different new dural sealants plays an important role in preventing these events. Moreover, the use of neuronavigation systems in skull base and posterior fossa surgery can help to minimize the size of approach and reduce the incidence of CSF leak. New minimally invasive spinal approaches, such as minimally invasive decompression for spinal degenerative disorders or performing selective laminotomies over laminectomies for intradural spinal pathology are very useful techniques to prevent CSF leak in this kind of surgery. In conclusion, although CSF leak remains a risky complication in neurosurgery, its prevention and treatment significantly benefited from advances in biomaterials and surgical technique.","6":"Ventral hernia is a common occurrence in patients undergoing solid organ transplant (SOT) and who require complex abdominal wall reconstruction (CAWR). The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of CAWR in SOT patients in a tertiary center. We performed a prospective cohort study in patients who underwent CAWR with biological mesh at our center from January 2016 to November 2021. As per the study protocol, all patients will be followed for 3 years. During the study period, we performed CAWR in 38 SOT patients. The mean age (Standard Deviation: SD) was 61 (9.5) years and the majority were males (68%). Mean body mass index (SD) was 30.3 (5.5) kg\/m2 and hernia repair was performed electively in 33 patients. The majority (82%) of the hernias were less than class 2 with a median mesh size (interquartile range) of 600 (400-800) cm2. Seventy-nine percent of patients were liver transplant recipients and the mesh was placed sub-lay (retro-rectus) (82%); the most common technique was posterior component separation (82%). Five patients (13.2%) had surgical site infection and 4 (10.5%) had unplanned reoperations. None of the patients died postoperatively and the 30-day readmission rate was 21%. Three patients (7.9%) had recurrence during follow-up and all of them underwent reoperation. Complex abdominal wall reconstruction (CAWR) using biologic mesh for solid organ transplant patients with ventral hernia is safe and has low recurrence when performed by a dedicated CAWR team. ","7":"Electrosurgery in gynecology has changed over the past few decades. The use of energy-based devices, especially in minimally invasive procedures, is extremely important for preparation, short reconvalescence and patient safety. Recently, there have been major advances in energy-based surgical devices that have further shortened OR time and increased patient safety. Although bipolar and monopolar electrosurgery is still very important, the introduction of high-frequency ultrasound in gynecologic surgery has improved cutting and coagulation by lowering thermal damage in the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, new technical inventions have fundamentally changed the treatment of specific diseases. The introduction of ablation in the therapy of uterine fibroids, for example, has made conventional myomectomy no longer necessary in some cases, as necrosis of fibroids can be induced by placing very small thermal probes into the fibroids. Robotic surgery will change the face of gynecological surgery in the near future, as the initial studies could show lower surgical morbidity and faster recovery of patients after robotic-assisted laparoscopy. In this article we provide a short overview of current technical advances, review possible indications as well as limitations, and take a look into the future of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology.","8":"The high-definition 3D operating exoscope is a new tool for surgical visualization and magnification that was designed to replace the operating microscope. However, the paucity of studies that have prospectively compared the two systems has made it difficult to draw clear recommendations. The purpose of this study was to compare the operating exoscope and the operating microscope in first-time users in a pre-clinical setting. Twenty-eight consecutive medical students were prospectively enrolled and randomized in a crossover design. Each student performed four exercises that required basic microsurgical skills. A tailored questionnaire (Comparison Assessment Tool) was used to subjectively compare the two systems using a 5-point Likert scale. The time needed to perform each task was recorded. A post-intervention cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the overall quality of the trial session. The operating exoscope was preferred over the operating microscope by most of the students in all items of the Comparison Assessment Tool, particularly with regard to \"focusing\" and \"image quality\" (n = 25, 92.6%). A significant difference between groups was found in two exercises that were easier to perform with the operating exoscope. Most of the students considered the overall quality of the evaluation experience to be \"very good\" (n = 25, 92.6%). The exoscope allows first-time users to better perform basic microsurgical tasks in a simulated clinical scenario compared to the operating microscope. Further prospective comparative studies will be needed to validate our preliminary findings in an actual clinical scenario. ","9":null,"10":"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) can often present with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI), including ischemic rest pain and severe tissue loss. Progression of PAD can lead to \"no option\" or end-stage disease in which there are no traditional open or endovascular interventions available for revascularization. This cohort of patients have a poor prognosis, with a major amputation rate of 40% and mortality of up to 20% at six months. For this patient population, surgical deep vein arterialization (DVA) is offered as an attempt to provide blood flow to the distal preserved venous bed and reverse the ischemic process. Surgical DVA has traditionally been offered as an option and was pioneered by Herb Dardik. The evolution of endovascular technology has allowed for percutaneous DVA (pDVA). Using ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance, an arteriovenous channel is created between a tibial artery and vein and reinforced with covered stent grafts to increase distal limb perfusion with the goals of improving wound healing and amputation-free survival. Lysis of venous valves with a valvulotome also aids with reversal of flow into the distal venous system. Investigations of percutaneous deep vein arterialization are underway with one device, the LimFlow System (LimFlow SA, Paris, France), which is undergoing feasibility trials. Here we present the current clinical indications, feasibility, results, and our institutional experience with the use of percutaneous deep vein arterialization.","11":"Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) using 1470 nm, which targets water as its chromophore, has become the standard endovenous thermal treatment for incompetent truncal veins. Recently, there has been growing interest in the use of 1940 nm, due to the greater absorption by water. This increased absorption has led to claims that, with the longer wavelength, less power is needed to achieve the same biological effect during treatment, resulting in fewer adverse post-operative sequelae. Review of the current literature comparing 1940 nm and 1470 nm EVLA, which includes both laboratory-based and clinical studies. Reports on the use of 1920 nm were combined with those on 1940 nm. Increased absorption of the longer wavelength by water results in more thermal damage closer to the EVLA device. Thus, there may be an advantage to using the longer wavelength in EVLA of thin-walled veins at low power. However, in saphenous veins, which have thicker walls, there is little evidence that this different energy distribution in the vein wall makes any clinical difference. Reduced pain is likely to be due to reduced power during treatment. This is likely to result in more long-term failures of ablation using 1940 nm. There is a difference in the distribution of thermal damage in the vein wall between EVLA at 1470 nm and 1940 nm. However, there is little evidence of any clinically significant difference when used in incompetent saphenous veins. Clinical studies looking for a difference need to report the size and wall thickness of the treated vein, the power used as well as the energy per centimetre (LEED), and long-term ablation rates in addition to early post-operative pain, induration, paraesthesia and ecchymosis. Also, power loss in different laser \/ fibre systems and technical differences, such as those that might allow blood to remain in the vein being treated, need to be considered. ","12":"Successful resection of all visible lesions may effectively treat endometriosis-related infertility and pelvic pain. Minimally invasive surgery provides significant advantages, with lower rates of surgical complications such as surgical trauma, infection, postoperative pain, and hospital stay. Robotic surgery is shown to have similar perioperative outcomes to conventional laparoscopy; however, complex stage III and IV endometriosis, especially cases requiring significant resection such as deep infiltrating endometriosis, widespread peritoneal implants, and urologic and intestinal involvement, may benefit most from a robotic approach. There are certain aspects of endometriosis surgery where utilization of robotic technology might provide an additional benefit. These include (1) heterogeneity of lesions, and thus difficulty in identification; (2) difficulty in accurately predicting surgical complexity; and (3) prolonged operative time for complex cases. The objective of this review is to describe the current and future perspectives of robotic surgery as it pertains to endometriosis.","13":null,"14":"The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is the main restraining force against lateral patellar displacement in the first 20 degrees of knee flexion and is often disrupted following patellar subluxation or dislocation. MPFL reconstruction is commonly performed to restore patellar stability but requires autograft harvest with associated donor site morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the five-year outcomes of MPFL repair performed with suture tape augmentation. All patients who underwent isolated MPFL repair for recurrent patellar instability between 2011 and 2017 were included. Patients requiring any additional surgery, such as osteotomy, were excluded. Patient-reported outcomes were measured at two-year follow up using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS-pain), Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), Marx Activity Scale, and an overall satisfaction questionnaire. At the end of the study period, any complications or secondary surgeries were determined. Eighteen patients underwent MPFL repair with one lost to follow up. There was a significant improvement in all subscales of the KOOS scoring systems, the WOMAC functional score, and the VR-12 physical score. A significant decrease was seen in the VAS-pain score. A non-significant decrease was seen in the Marx activity scale from pre-injury. The majority of patients reported satisfaction with reduction in pain and return to sporting activities. There were no complications with no further instability episodes. This is the first study that describes the five-year follow-up results of patients treated with MPFL repair and suture tape augmentation. Our results show that this technique is an alternative treatment to traditional MPFL reconstruction with comparable outcomes and avoidance of autograft harvest. ","15":"Low-intensity shockwave therapy (Li-SWT) is a promising option for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Many devices with different characteristics in terms of generators, shockwaves, set-up parameters and procedure protocols are commercially available. In this report, we present our experience with the main shockwave technologies currently in use in clinical practice for ED treatment. A retrospective national, multi-institutional study was performed to compare the effects of different shockwave technologies in ED patients. All of the subjects underwent 8 consecutive weekly physical treatments with SWT under either a focused or non-focused regimen: 3,000 shocks per session at 0.09 mJ\/mm2 and 10,000 shocks per session at 15 Hz and 90 mJ, respectively. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing pre- and post-treatment Sexual Health Inventory in Men (SHIM) scores, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and Erection Hardness Score (EHS). Possible relationships between type of shockwave generator, source, morphology and type of ED were investigated. A total of 94 men were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in the baseline clinical characteristics or demographics. The mean (SD) increase in the scores from questionnaires evaluated at 8 weeks was clinically and statistically significant, with overall improvements of +5.49, +5.47 and +1.18 (p&lt;0.0001) in the IIEF-5, SHIM, and EHS scores, respectively. The increases in these scores were evaluated by a multiple regression analysis, in relation to the shockwave generator, type of ED, shockwave source and morphology, but none of the factors examined predicted improvement. No side effects were reported with any device. SWT is a clinically effective and safe treatment for ED that is independent of the generator type, source, shockwave morphology emitted, type of ED and perhaps treatment protocol. ","16":null,"17":null,"18":"Gastroparesis, a chronic disorder distinguished by delays in gastric emptying, has been a concern for both health providers and hospitals due to several of its characteristics. Gastroparesis is heterogeneous in nature and is associated with several comorbidities and increasing mortality rates. It can often be caused by underlying conditions, most of which are not well understood. This lack of knowledge regarding its underlying mechanisms creates a need to better understand the risk factors involved in this patient population. This study was undertaken to understand the risk factors involved in the mortality of patients who present with gastroparesis. This retrospective study considered data from the National Inpatient Sample for patients who were admitted with a primary diagnosis of gastroparesis from 2005 to 2014. The data were stratified according to various factors of interest to identify risk factors involved in mortality using statistical tools, including a multivariable logistic regression model with backward elimination. A total of 27,000 patients were admitted emergently with a primary diagnosis of gastroparesis. The mortality rate in adult patients (0.18%, N=39) was much lower than that in elderly patients (1.27%, N=71). Females accounted for the majority of patients in both the adult (73.7%) and elderly (71%) populations. The mean age of patients in the adult and elderly groups was 43 and 75 years, respectively. The association between mortality and age was significant in both adults (OR=1.04, 95%CI=1.005-1.08, p&lt;0.025) and the elderly (OR=1.08, 95%CI=1.04-1.12, p&lt;0.001). The hospital length of stay (HLOS, days) in adult females (5.08, SD=5.04) was significantly longer than that in adult males (4.41, SD=5.10) (p&lt;0.001). The association between mortality and HLOS was significant in both adults (OR=1.12, 95%CI=1.09-1.15, p&lt;0.001) and elderly patients (OR=1.10, 95%CI=1.06-1.14, p&lt;0.001). A lower percentage of adults (6.6%, N=1,402) underwent an operation compared to the elderly (9.6%, N=538). The mean time to operation was 4.76 days for adult patients who survived and 17.50 days for adult patients who did not survive (SD=5.37 and 9.37, respectively, p=0.006). On the other hand, this value was 5.57 and 9.10 days for elderly patients (SD=6.50 and 7.15, respectively, p=0.037). Among patients who underwent an operation, the association between mortality and time to operation was significant for both adults (OR=1.17, 95%CI=1.094-1.247, p&lt;0.001) and elderly patients (OR=1.05, 95%CI=1.005-1.124, p&lt;0.001). The risk of mortality in elderly patients with emergent gastroparesis was 7-fold greater than that in adult patients. The odds of mortality increased by 8% for every year increase in age in elderly patients and by 4% in adults. ","19":"Complex abdominal wall defects (CAWDs) are a new surgical entity that require a dedicated and multidisciplinary approach. The spectra of CAWDs and complex abdominal wall reconstruction (CAWR) are poorly defined, and may include any of these elements: large or multiple recurrent hernia, presence of previously placed mesh (open or laparoscopic), loss of abdominal wall domain due to trauma, infection or tumor resection, hernia in the presence of enterocutaneous or enteroatmospheric fistulae (ECF\/EAF), hernia in the presence of infected sinus tract, large debilitating parastomal hernia, hernias in the presence of synthetic erosion into the bowel or causing intestinal obstruction, eroded hernias post open abdomen management with skin graft in the presence of intraabdominal catastrophe or massive trauma, and hernias (umbilical or ventral\/incisional) in patients with cirrhosis in the presence of massive ascites. The relevance of abdominal wall reconstruction with reinforcement using synthetic or biological mesh has never been as high as it is now. In particular, the use of biological mesh is rising exponentially due to its inherent properties. We previously described a nine-step approach to the management of difficult abdomen with enterocutaneous fistula. In this paper, we update this strategy based on our recent experience with almost 300 patients at our institution who underwent CAWR. Special attention is paid to the management of contaminated fields and the rationale of using biological mesh.","20":"Metaphyseal bone defects seen at revision total knee replacement (TKA) have traditionally been treated with bone graft or cement. Recently, metal augments have surfaced as viable alternatives to conventional methods previously used in these patients. Newer 3D-printed metal cones offer better biological fixation as a means of improving construct stability. This study aimed to determine clinical and radiographic outcomes of the novel 3D-printed titanium cone augments for femoral and tibial metaphyseal bone defects. A retrospective review was undertaken of 72 patients who underwent revision TKA with metaphyseal cones (Stryker) and stemmed implants from 2015-2017. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS Jr) and VR\/SF-12 scores were recorded. Knee Society radiographic scores were calculated at latest follow up to evaluate for radiolucency and biological fixation. Loosening noted on radiographs and reoperation for any reason were the endpoints to determine survivorship. A total of 68 patients with 78 cones (58 tibial, 20 femoral) met inclusion criteria. Mean follow up was 3.4 years (range 2-5.4 years). The average KOOS Jr score increased from 38 preoperatively to 66 at two years. The average VR\/SF-12 PH score increased from 33 preoperatively to 37 at two years. The average VR\/SF-12 MH score increased from 46 preoperatively to 54 at two years. Twelve percent of tibial implants and 10% of femoral implants with cones were found to have lucency in at least one radiographic zone. Overall survivorship at latest follow up was 93% with two patients requiring revision for infection, two revised following mechanical complications, and one patient who underwent polyethylene exchange after experiencing mechanical complications. When considering only aseptic loosening, survivorship was 100%. This 3D-printed titanium femoral and tibial cone augment system showed excellent survivorship, biological fixation, clinical outcomes, and radiographic outcomes in the setting of TKA. Further studies are needed for assessment of long-term survivorship.

However, this goal is not yet in sight with the present state of technology. Over the past few years, tremendous advances have been achieved regarding tissue anticalcification processes, hemodynamic performance and future-proofing by ensuring compatibility with transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures. The Inspiris Resilia valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) was designed to incorporate all of these enhancements. It is now leaving the experimental phase and is being tested in the real world. We present here a comprehensive review of the evolution of biological prostheses, details of new anticalcification technologies, and early results of published studies as well as the experience at the European Hospital (Rome, Italy), the site of the first European implant and a leading center in various protocols. In our two years of experience with the Inspiris Resilia, there have been no cases of structural valve deterioration, endocarditis, detachment or periprocedural complication, and gradients seem to be superior to those with the previous generation of Edwards valves. While longer-term experience is clearly needed, the results thus far are encouraging.","24":"Endovascular treatment options of aorto-iliac occlusive disease have emerged, leading to better outcomes in more complex pathology, which typically involves a reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation. The Covered Endovascular Reconstruction of Aortic Bifurcation (CERAB) configuration was introduced in 2013, in an attempt to optimize outcomes, when compared to the kissing stent configuration, which was traditionally the preferred endovascular technique for this pathology. CERAB aims to optimize geometry, and with that the arterial flow patterns that are associated with loss of patency. In CERAB, the aortic bifurcation is reconstructed using three balloon-expandable covered stents in a tight connection with each other and with an appropriate wall apposition, thereby minimizing geometrical mismatch (Fig. 1a-c). The reconstruction can be extended on both sides and could be combined with chimney, or parallel, grafts in aortic side branches that need to be preserved. In the current paper, the details of the CERAB technique are described and supported by evidence derived from pre-clinical studies that confirm the more optimal geometry and flow patterns compared to kissing stents. Also, a summary is provided of published clinical evidence, including technical and clinical outcomes of the technique. These data show promising early results, with patency rates in line with those achieved with open surgery, also in patients with extensive disease. Finally, the potential modes of failures and future developments are discussed.","25":"We treated a small cohort of venous ulcers that were very unresponsive to standard and advanced therapies with autologous cultured bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This pilot clinical trial was randomized, controlled, and double-blinded. Subjects were treated with either normal saline (Group A), fibrin spray alone (Group B), or MSCs in fibrin (1 million cells\/cm2 of wound bed surface) (Group C). The control and test materials were applied to the wound using a double-barreled syringe with thrombin and fibrinogen (with or without MSCs) in each barrel, or saline alone in both barrels. The MSCs were separated, cultured in vitro, and expanded in a dedicated Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility from 30-50 ml of bone marrow aspirate obtained from the iliac crest in Group C subjects. To ensure that the study remained controlled and blinded, subjects who were randomized to one of the two control arms (saline or fibrin) underwent sham bone marrow aspiration performed by a hematologist who anesthetized the iliac crest area down to and pushing against the periosteum, but without penetrating the bone marrow. Therefore, both the clinician who evaluated wound progress and the study subjects had no knowledge of whether bone aspiration was actually performed and what treatment had been applied to the wound. The study was performed after full FDA investigational new drug (IND) approval. The primary endpoint was the rate of healing (wound closure as linear healing from the wound margins in cm\/week), as measured by the Gilman equation. One-way ANOVA was used to calculate the statistical significance of differences between the mean healing rates of each of the 3 treatment groups every 4 weeks and over the 24 weeks of treatment. Overall, treatment with MSCs accelerated the healing rate by about 10-fold compared to those in the saline and fibrin control groups. Although the total number of patients in this pilot study was small (n=11), the statistical significance was surprisingly promising: p&lt;0.01 and f-ratio of 15.9358. No serious adverse events were noted. This small but carefully performed prospective, controlled, randomized, and double-blinded pilot study in a rare population of totally unresponsive patients adds to previous reports showing the promise of MSCs in the treatment of chronic wounds and provides proof of principle for how to approach this type of very demanding clinical and translational research.","26":"Since its adoption as a surgical technique over a half-century ago, stapling has continually undergone improvements, both in the devices used and in our understanding of tissue mechanics. To best design and use stapling devices, it is beneficial to have an intimate knowledge of the response of tissue to compression and stapling dynamics. This paper provides the relevant background in the field of biomechanics, and in particular addresses the viscoelastic behavior of soft tissues under compression. Biomechanics of Stapling: The change in shape of a solid, or strain, is related to the load applied, or stress. Biological tissues are known to have non-linear relationships between stress and strain, and generally the relationships are anisotropic (dependent upon direction). Further complicating matters, there is typically a time-dependency to the relationship for compression and recovery, resulting in viscoelastic behavior. Hence both the amount and rate of compressive force applied can be expected to impact the outcome of stapling. The growth of the laparoscopic use of staples has increased the difficulty of device design, as precise control of compression is problematic in extended length staplers. Progressive firing along the cartridge and multi-stage compression have both been found to be beneficial in providing the uniform force needed to produce well-formed staples. Such technical advances can reduce stresses within the stapler, preventing deformation of the stapler arm and undesirable strain in the tissue. Current research includes understanding the effects of changing the rate of compression on staple formation with the hope that further improvements can be achieved in this ever-fruitful method of tissue apposition. ","27":"We report our experience in patients who were treated with cold plasma wound therapy from 2016 to 2020. Thirty-six patients with a median age of 71 years (23 males, 13 females) were registered in a prospective database. The median follow up was six months. In 15 patients, their wounds were associated with peripheral arterial disease, and they received peripheral interventional or open revascularisation prior to cold plasma therapy. Seven patients had a chronic venous insufficiency and 3 diabetic patients had chronic wounds caused by polyneuropathy. One patient suffered from chronic lymphoid disease. The cause of the wound could not be identified in the remaining patients. Wound treatment was conducted in an outpatient setting, if possible. Four patients were lost during follow-up. Surgical debridement of the wound before cold plasma therapy began was necessary in 14 cases. Each patient received 1 to 3 cold plasma treatments a week; 2 patients were treated for 1 year and the remaining patients were treated for 4 to 11 weeks. There were no major amputations in the long-term follow-up. In 25 patients, the progress of the wound stopped and in 11 patients the wounds were closed at the end of the therapy. In conclusion, our results support the use of cold plasma in complex wounds. Causal therapy is mandatory. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the impact of supplemental modern wound treatment with cold plasma therapy.","28":"The passage of flatus and stool, as well as tolerating a solid diet, represents a crucial moment in recovery after colonic resections. The present study compares functional recovery after left and right colectomies for colon cancer. This is a retrospective analysis. Consecutive patients with elective left and right colon resections were examined. Primary analysis compared time to first bowel motion and development of postoperative ileus. Secondary analyses tried to define risk factors for prolonged restoration of bowel function in right- and left-sided resection groups. In total, 147 patients were included. While laparoscopic approach was preferred for both sides (87% vs. 87%; p=0.496), left colectomies took longer (183 vs. 153 min; p=0.012), the lymph node harvest was smaller (16 vs. 20; p=0.005), and there was an increased need for perioperative fluids (4451 vs. 4039ml; p=0.006). Epidural use, postoperative potassium level, and glycemia were similar. Also, no significant differences were observed for complications and length of stay. First flatus was observed at postoperative day 1, 9 (left), and 2.5 (right), respectively (p=0.002). There was no significant difference in passage of first stool and intake of first solid food. Twenty-seven patients (35%) needed a postoperative nasogastric tube after right colectomy compared to 11 patients (16%) after left colectomy (p=0.012). Right-sided colectomies required the tube for longer (6.1 vs. 3.4; p=0.005). Postoperative ileus was more frequent after right-sided colectomies despite shorter operative time. The reason for this finding is currently unknown and deserves further attention. For the time being, we can just be more cautious with early feeding after right colectomy.

In Part I of this series, we reviewed the benefits of the continuous flow gynecologic resectoscope (CFGR) and how the motivated gynecologist can assemble an operative team and overcome the impediments to learning the use of this versatile and minimally invasive instrument. In this first section, we outlined and analyzed basic resectoscopic surgery-endometrial ablation, the resection of small submucous myomas and endometrial polyps, as well as the treatment of mild Asherman's syndrome and the removal of retained products of conception. In Part II-intermediate level resectoscopic surgery-we introduced procedures such as endomyometrial resection, the resection of intermediate-size submucous leiomyomas, hysteroscopic metroplasty, and endocervical resection. Though it is not considered an absolute requirement to accomplish procedures at this level, sonographic guidance was introduced in preparation for more challenging cases. In Part III, the author reviews advanced resectoscopic procedures in which sonographic guidance is a requirement for the management of severe intrauterine adhesions and late-onset endometrial ablation failures, the management of FIGO Type 3 and 4 intramural myomas, as well as large submucous myomas.","31":"Many strategies have been employed to improve operating room efficiency when performing total knee arthroplasty. The goals of efficiency improvements are to decrease operative time and reduce healthcare expenses while providing patients the best quality surgical care. Single-use disposable instruments are one technique to accomplish efficiency. The authors describe their experience with a specific implant manufacturer's disposable single-use instruments for total knee arthroplasty and analyze the cost and time savings compared to traditional instrumentation. Single-use disposable instruments are a viable option to improve OR efficiency, decrease sterile processing burden, and ensure sterile instrumentation for total knee arthroplasty. Furthermore, cost savings can be realized based on an institution's sterile processing expenses and whether the manufacturer or facility covers the cost of the single-use instruments.","32":"This study analyzed the effectiveness of minimizing surgical trauma, reducing the severity of the stress reaction, and restoring the normal functioning of the body after planned gallbladder operations under an enhanced recovery program. This prospective comparison study included 30 patients from the surgical department of Irkutsk Clinical Hospital No. 1 who had been diagnosed with cholelithiasis in 2019-2020. All 30 patients completed the study and were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the FTS group (group I, n = 15) and the standard group (group II, n = 15). The comparison groups were statistically homogeneous in terms of preoperative parameters. All patients underwent prescribed surgeries. In the early and late postoperative period, there were no cases of mortality or significant complications. A comparison of the groups with respect to the effectiveness of treatment according to established criteria showed good treatment results for 13 (86.6%) patients in group I and 2 (13.3%) patients in group II (p = 0.016). The FTS treatment protocol was a significant predictor of treatment success (OR 3.1; 95% CI 0.2; 6.0; p = 0.033). The fast track surgery protocol gave superior results for surgical treatment in comparison with the standard protocol in patients with cholelithiasis. ","33":"Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a well-recognized complication following operative fixation of acetabular fractures with a range of severity and clinical consequences. The purpose of this review was to: (1) report the incidence of heterotopic ossification (HO) formation following operative fixation of acetabular fractures; (2) determine the effectiveness of prophylactic treatments for HO; and (3) assess the radiographic severity of HO with and without prophylactic treatment. A literature search for peer-reviewed articles was conducted utilizing a variety of research databases. PRISMA guidelines were followed and included in this review were full-length, English language manuscripts published before September 2019, using the following search criteria: \"heterotopic ossification AND acetabulum OR acetabular.\" Studies that reported HO as one of the reported outcomes were included. Articles were excluded if radiographic HO was not reported and if it was evaluated in surgeries other than those involved in acetabular fractures. Extracted data included, but was not limited to: type of prophylaxis; incidence of HO; severity of HO based on the Brooker classification; and statistical significance. A methodologic quality appraisal of the included studies was also conducted. A total of 54 full-text studies with 5,890 patients with operatively fixed acetabular fractures met inclusion criteria. There were four level I studies, four level II study, 26 level III studies, and 20 level IV studies. The overall incidence of HO after acetabular fracture surgery was 28.4%. The rate of HO formation was: 34.9% without prophylaxis, 28.3% with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) prophylaxis, and 21.2% with radiation therapy (RT). Patients receiving a combination of both RT and NSAIDs developed HO 21.8% of the time. The rate of radiographic severe HO was 13.9% (range, 0-75%) in patients without prophylaxis, 9.4% (range, 0-50%) with NSAID prophylaxis, 5.7% (range, 0-12.8%) with RT prophylaxis, and 11.7% (range, 0-18.5%) with the combination of RT and NSAIDs. With the current literature collected in this systematic review, there was a lower incidence and severity of heterotopic bone formation following acetabular fracture fixation using radiation prophylaxis compared to NSAIDs or no treatment. The available literature is heterogeneous in fracture characteristics, surgical approaches, and prophylactic regimens with a general lack of randomized control trials. Further prospective studies are required to make definitive claims on the optimal prophylactic strategy to prevent heterotopic ossification. ","34":"Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are one of the most feared complications in the realm of adult reconstruction due to the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with these cases. Advancements in arthroplasty have been made across a variety of areas of interest including implant surfaces, implant design, material science, etc., but a focus on infection prevention and treatment is of utmost importance. A new technology has been created that targets biofilm and aims to prevent infection in total joint arthroplasty. In this manuscript we aim to describe the benefits of this technology and describe the ideal use in a case scenario format. We believe that with this technology that we can approach the goal of a zero periprosthetic infection rate.","35":"Treatment of chronic wounds that are at risk of infection, or that are infected, require the use of antimicrobial dressings, most often those that contain silver. Silver exerts its antimicrobial effects by binding to multiple cellular components and, as such, bacterial resistance to it is low; however, molecular silver resistance has been documented and is attributed to the presence of the sil operon or changes in genes encoding porin and efflux pump expression. The aim of this study was to evaluate spontaneous silver resistance development in common opportunistic pathogens, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Enterococcus cloacae, as well as resistance development when exposed to subtherapeutic concentrations over a prolonged period. Furthermore, following silver resistance development, cross-resistance to several classes of antibiotics was evaluated. Following exposure of the strains to silver sulfadiazine (SSD) at two times and four times minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the mutation rate was &lt;1010 colony forming unit (CFU)\/mL. Serial passage of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in subinhibitory concentrations of SSD selected for no resistant mutants. The SSD MIC of E. cloacae increased past the solubility limit of SSD at serial passage 17. MIC testing of this isolate showed a &gt;2048-fold increase in MIC to silver in comparison to the parent strain. MIC testing of the serial passage isolates demonstrated no cross-resistance to antibiotics from six different classes. Overall, the results of this study show resistance development to silver is low and, if it does occur, it does not confer resistance to several antibiotic classes. However, as this study was carried out with a small number of strains, a study with a larger panel of strains and sequencing of the strains to determine the exact mechanism of resistance would be needed to investigate the threat of silver resistance further.","36":null,"37":null,"38":"Recent studies have shown the prevalence of depressive disorders has increased within the United States. Studies investigating the impact of depressive disorders following primary THA are limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with depressive disorders have higher rates of: 1) in-hospital lengths of stay (LOS); 2) readmission rates; 3) medical complications; and 4) implant-related complications. A retrospective query of the Humana claims database was performed. Patients undergoing primary THA with a history of depressive disorders were identified by International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Study group patients were matched to controls in a 1:5 ratio by age, sex, and comorbidities. The query yielded 67,245 patients with (n=11,255) and without (n=55,990) depressive disorders. Welch's t-tests were used to test for significance in LOS between the cohorts; whereas, logistics regression analyses were used for complications and readmissions. A p-value less than 0.003 was statistically significant. Patients with depressive disorders undergoing primary THA had significantly longer in-hospital LOS (6.59 days vs. 2.96 days, p &lt;0.0001). Additionally, patients with depressive disorders had higher incidence and odds of readmission rates (46.02 vs. 35.43%; OR: 1.55, p &lt;0.0001), medical complications (7.05 vs. 1.84%; OR: 4.04, p &lt;0.0001), and implant-related complications (5.76 vs. 2.75%; OR: 2.16, p &lt;0.0001) compared to patients without depressive disorders. After matching age, sex, and medical comorbidities, the results of the study demonstrate patients with depressive disorders have longer in-hospital LOS and increased rates of complications and readmission rates. The study is useful as it can allow orthopedic surgeons to properly counsel these patients of the potential complications which may arise following their procedure. ","39":"Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) retention may impact a patient's awareness of their artificial joint following primary total knee arthroplasty (pTKA) due to increased proprioception and more native knee kinematics. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether cruciate-retaining (CR) or posterior-stabilized (PS) implants influence the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12) following pTKA. We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent pTKA with a CR or PS implant at our institute between October 2017 and March 2021. Of the 6,258 patients identified, 5,587 did not have recorded FJS-12 scores at either three months, one year, or two years postoperatively nor a Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR) preoperatively, three months, or one year postoperatively, and these were considered lost to follow up. Thus, a total of 671 cases were identified and subsequently stratified into two cohorts based on whether they received a CR (n=236, 35%) or PS (n=435, 65%) implant. Patients who received PS implants were further divided into constrained (CoN) and non-constrained (NCoN) liner cohorts. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to compare patient-reported outcome (PRO) scores. There were no significant differences in PRO scores between CR and PS implants at any time point. Patients in the CoN (n=74) cohort had significantly higher FJS-12 scores at one year (CoN: 56.31 + 25.34 vs NCoN: 42.24 + 27.00, p=0.001) and two years (CoN: 58.52 + 33.71 vs NCoN: 46.97 + 27.44, p=0.013) postoperatively compared to patients in the NCoN (n=361) cohort. Although our analysis demonstrated significant differences in FJS-12 scores at one and two years postoperatively depending upon the liner constraint, there were no significant differences in FJS-12 scores between CR and PS implants. Therefore, while retention of the PCL does not impact patient awareness of their artificial joint, the level of liner constraint may influence outcomes if the PCL is sacrificed.

FET may or may not be a definitive repair, however. Distal extension or completion-especially endovascular-is common but not well described in the literature. This review describes the considerations that are necessary during FET planning and preparation, how pathology specifics and sizing decisions will affect the subsequent need for treatment, and how outcomes might be better reported to improve understanding of the advantages and limitations of the technique. This literature review was performed to identify reports of second-stage endovascular completion after FET repair, and included any literature that described such interventions after index FET, for any aortic arch pathology. Secondary intervention after FET is an important parameter to establish the success or failure of the index procedure. However, unplanned extensions are often reported with insufficient detail and follow up, and studies rarely differentiate between unplanned or adjunctive procedures. In addition, prediction of the need for extension is complicated by the response of the pathology to the index procedure. FET is a versatile, established surgical technique that allows for several applications in different pathologies and innovative adaptations. How, when, and why FET is extended needs to be reported in greater detail, with specific consideration given to the interaction of FET and endovascular devices in sizing, integrity, and possible complications. ","43":null,"44":"Since the last decade, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the treatment of choice in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are ineligible or at higher risk for surgery. Due to the high safety profile of current device generation, TAVI has emerged as a qualified alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with classic aortic stenosis and intermediate surgical risk, severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, and isolated pure aortic regurgitation. Moderate aortic stenosis, with and without concomitant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, are under investigation in randomized controlled clinical trials from which we will gain exciting insights on the best timing of TAVI to protect the left ventricle from further functional deterioration due to increasing AS. In these cases, a meticulous diagnostic approach including advanced imaging is becoming more and more important. Current evidence on antithrombotic strategies after TAVI is weak, contributing to poor levels of standardization and high variability in daily clinical practice. This review will provide a short overview of recent clinical trials including best timing for TAVI with moderate AS and antithrombotic strategies after TAVI with current and future TAVI generations.","45":"Robotic-arm assisted lower extremity arthroplasty using computed tomography scan (CT)-based 3-dimensional (3D) modeling operative technologies has increasingly become mainstream over the past decade with over 550,000 procedures performed between first use in 2006 and November 2021. Studies have demonstrated multiple advantages with these technologies, such as decreased postoperative pain and subsequent decreased narcotic usage, decreased lengths of stay, less complications, reduced damage to soft tissues, decreased readmissions, as well as economic advantages in the form of meaningful cost savings for payors. The purpose of this report was to clearly and concisely summarize the good-to-high methodology peer-reviewed, published literature regarding CT scan-based, 3-dimensional robotically-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty stratified by: (1) prospective randomized studies; (2) database comparison studies; (3) national registry studies; (4) health utility studies; (5) comparison studies; and (6) basic science studies. A literature search was conducted and, after applying inclusion criteria, each study was graded based on the modified Coleman methodology score (\"excellent\" 85-100, \"good\" 70-84, \"fair\" 55-69, \"poor\" &lt;54 points). A total of 63 of 63 good-to-excellent methodology score reports were positive for this technology, including 11 that demonstrated decreased pain and\/or opioid use when compared to traditional arthroplasty techniques. The summary results of these high-quality, peer-reviewed published studies demonstrated multiple advantages of this CT scan-based robotic-arm assisted platform for lower extremity arthroplasty.","46":"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is one of the most common bariatric surgical procedures. Despite being easier to perform than other bariatric procedures, it is not free of complications. Leaks are some of the most severe events, and are observed in around 0.5-6% of cases. Use of the near-infrared indocyanine green (ICG) perfusion test during sleeve gastrectomy seems to be promising. However, its application in sleeve gastrectomy is still in fieri. Similarly, ICG is not commonly used in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This report presents the main evidence from selected literature regarding the use of ICG during sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, along with our remarks. It also provides intraoperative video clips and photographs showing the use of ICG in this surgical field.","47":"There is resurging interest in the importance of effective, nuanced insufflation and personalised pneumoperitoneal pressure-management during laparoscopy. Here, we present user-evaluation data from a regulated, prospective, multispecialty study of a new insufflator (EVA-15, Palliare, Galway, Ireland) which provides high-frequency pressure-sensing, built-in smoke evacuation with pedal activation and highly responsive, high-flow gas provision. With institutional ethics and regulatory body approval, a non-randomised, prospective clinical investigation was performed on 30 subjects undergoing laparoscopic surgery using an EVA-15 device. Cases were selected from a variety of specialties on a near-consecutive basis without specific exclusion criteria. Users (both surgeons and operating room nurses) completed a survey at case completion to capture ordinal categorical data on a 5-point Likert agreement scale (1 - Strongly disagree to 5 - Strongly agree) concerning (i) Settings and Setup Evaluations, (ii) Alarms and Displays Evaluations, (iii) Short Instruction Guide, and (iv) Insufflator Performance along with any additional feedback. Operations on 30 patients (mean age 54 y, 15 males) were studied with a questionnaire completed by operating room teams after individual consent. The procedures included general (n=13), upper (n=3) and lower (n=6) gastrointestinal surgery, bariatric (n=3), hepatobiliary (n=2) urology (n=2, both robotic prostatectomy) and gynaecology (n=1) operations. In all cases, the laparoscopic component was completed capably with the use of the EVA-15 device. The insufflator evaluation score across all categories was a median of 4, demonstrating satisfactory use and performance in all regards. The EVA-15 is a smart insufflator system that is capable of satisfactory performance across a spectrum of cases among different specialties. ","48":"Oxygen is an undisputed key factor in wound healing. Adequate oxygen pressure in tissues allows for cell growth and proliferation, necessary for wound healing. In the case of peripheral arterial disease leading to hypoxemia, oxygen supplementation is beneficial. The roles and validity of topical and systemic oxygen therapy in wound healing is debated. Topical oxygen therapy (TOT) is delivered at 100% oxygen saturation and has been demonstrated to increase the pO2 levels within the wound base center, decrease the size of the wound, and decrease the time to wound healing compared to patients that did not undergo topical oxygen therapy. Alternatives to topical oxygen therapy are systemic oxygen therapy including hyperbaric oxygen therapy and inspired oxygen therapy. Systemic oxygen therapy carries the risk of oxygen organ toxicity as the result of an oxidative stress and genotoxicity state. Topical O2 therapy is a viable option for chronic wounds, with its demonstrated effects on decrease in wound size and time to healing. Adjunctive clinical wound debridement's decrease the necrotic debris and therefore the topical oxygen diffusion distance optimizing the therapy effect.","49":"Since its introduction in 1995, minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) has been shown to be a valid alternative to conventional sternotomy and several studies have reported excellent clinical outcomes. While MIMVS is now a commonly performed procedure, it is still difficult to standardize. We proprose here a \"road to safer surgery\", and offer some tips and tricks that could be useful in its learning and performance, and may help surgeons minimize the risk of major complications. With the introduction of 3D vision with a 3D videothoracoscope for 4K stereoscopic acquisition, a medical LCD ultra-HD monitor and active 3D glasses, it is possible to obtain a very realistic view of the surgical field and the mitral valve anatomy, while significantly reducing the learning curve. We describe the procedure step-by-step, with details from the pre-operative phase to the end of the operation. The procedure is structured in consecutive stages: patient induction and positioning, thoracoscopic access and port placement, surgical field exposure, and operative technique.","50":"Preparation of the wound bed is a key step in the use of cell- and tissue-based therapy (CTP). In particular, good pre-application debridement is an essential component of CTP. However, there are many situations in which the wound bed is not adequately debrided, including trauma, burn, and in cases of chronic wounds with significant biofilm. In the setting of inadequate wound bed preparation, the use of a CTP that has either added or intrinsic antimicrobial properties is attractive. Some CTPs include added antimicrobial agents such as PHMB or silver, while others have intrinsic antimicrobial components, such as Omega 3 fatty acids. In addition, some wound-covering dressings are completely synthetic, and therefore simply do not become infected. A full understanding of the basic science and clinical data supporting the use of these therapies is important for the advanced wound care practitioner.","51":"Simulation-based education is a useful teaching and learning strategy that can help to implement guidelines into healthcare settings. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to collate, synthesize, and analyze the literature focusing on the use of simulation as an educational strategy to support guidelines implementation among healthcare providers (HCPs). Integrative literature review using the methodology proposed by Ganong. Twenty-three articles were selected, the majority (n=19, 82%) used simulation in practice settings and pre- and post-test measurement (n=16, 69%). All studies that assessed simulation effects highlighted that the use of simulation improved the measured outcomes related to guideline implementation. Simulation-based education can be an effective strategy to support guidelines implementation among HCPs, but aspects such as cost involved, time constraints, training of educators, and the HCPs' learning needs can affect its applicability. Future research should focus on more transparent reports related to the guidelines for simulation content, virtual learning, costs of simulation, and measurement of the long-term effects of simulation-based education. ","52":"Elderly patients admitted emergently for ventral hernia may have high rates of complications, including morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to retrospectively assess risk factors for in-hospital mortality for elderly patients admitted emergently with a primary diagnosis of ventral hernia. Elderly patients with ventral hernia that required emergency admission were analyzed using the National Inpatient Sample database, 2005-2014. Demographics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected. The relationship between mortality and the predictors was assessed using a stratified analysis, multivariable logistic regression model, and multivariable generalized additive model. A total of 33,700 elderly patients were analyzed. The mean (SD) age for males and females was 75 (7.25) and 76.25 (7.75) years, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Approximately 70% of the patients were females. The mean (SD) hospital length of stay (HLOS) was 6.3 (6.5) and 11.6 (13.7) days in survived vs. deceased patients (p&lt;0.001), respectively. Gangrene was present in 1.5% of survivors vs. 5.6% of deceased (p&lt;0.001) patients. Intestinal obstruction was observed in 78% of survivors vs. 88% of deceased patients (p&lt;0.001). Of the 8,554 cases managed non-operatively, 2.1% died. In contrast, in the 25,163 patients who were operated upon, the mortality rate was 2.9%. The mean (SD) HLOS was 7.39 (7.41) days in patients who had an operation vs. 3.82 (3.48) days in those who did not (p&lt;0.0001). Time to operation was 1.12 (1.97) days in survivors vs. 1.81 (3.02) days in deceased patients (p&lt;0.001). In the final multivariable logistic regression model for patients who underwent an operation, delayed operation, elderly male, frailty, invasive diagnostic procedures and presence of gangrene or obstruction were the main risk factors for mortality. In the final model for patients who did not have an operation, age, frailty, presence of gangrene or obstruction and HLOS were the main risk factors for mortality. A delayed operation in elderly males and frail patients with intestinal obstruction or gangrene admitted emergently due to ventral hernia significantly increases mortality in this setting.

Despite the remarkable advances that have been made in surgical techniques and implant technology, the incidence of PJI has remained largely unchanged over the past two decades. One approach that has been described in the literature to minimize the risk of PJI has been the use of silver-coated prostheses. Silver has been reported to have antimicrobial properties when added to a variety of orthopaedic materials including bone cement, hydroxyapatite coatings and wound dressings. Silver is also being increasingly used as a surface coating for endoprostheses used for reconstruction around the hip and the knee with the specific aim of reducing the incidence of prosthetic joint infection. Despite the increasing adoption of this technology, the use of silver coatings remains controversial. The optimal method for preparation and the thickness of the coating, as well as the mechanism(s) of action in reducing the incidence of PJI, are unclear. The issue of silver toxicity is also an important consideration. This paper provides an overview of the use of silver coatings in reconstructive orthopaedics, as well as the types available and techniques used to coat endoprostheses. We also review the basic science as well as the clinical applications of silver coatings in the prevention of PJIs.","55":"Apart from the tremendous increase in the demand for telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telemedical technology offers many advantages, such as better coverage of rural areas and improved access to specialists. While current telediagnostic possibilities are often limited to a verbal consultation, the field of surgery has already made use of robotics for one of the most challenging areas of medicine: invasive procedures. Since comprehensive diagnostics are a prerequisite for each surgery, we built upon the knowledge gained in telesurgery and developed a telediagnostic system that allows for an extensive perioperative and emergency examination. It is based on a robotic platform consisting of a remote lead robotic arm at the physician's site and a follower robot at the patient's site. Mirroring all movements directly and using force-feedback, both parties can precisely interact, enabling tasks such as auscultation, percussion, and palpation without the need for extensive training. Our overall setup also includes the possibility to measure and monitor all relevant vital parameters and can be used to perform ear and nasopharyngeal inspections as well as an automatic swab to screen for COVID or other contagious diseases prior to hospital admission. In this paper, we focus on the potential of this technology for the surgical community by demonstrating the ease of adding an ultrasound probe to our modular setup to perform a high-quality emergency ultrasound examination. While the system is not yet ready for everyday use in a hospital and drawbacks such as a high cost persist, our setup paves the way for the future use of telediagnostics in surgery.","56":null,"57":"Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease impacts over 2 million Americans annually. Since the advent of the carotid endarterectomy by Debakey in 1953, the surgical management of carotid artery stenosis has prevented cerebrovascular accidents.

This review discusses the modern management of carotid artery stenosis with an emphasis on transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) and reversal of flow for reversal of flow for embolic protection.","58":"Abdominal complications following cardiac surgery have high mortality rates. This study analyzes the outcomes of patients who have undergone emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures after cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) at the same hospitalization. This was a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent emergent abdominal surgery after CTS surgery between 2010-2018. The CTS procedures included coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement, cardiac transplant, aortic replacement, ventricular assist device, and pericardial procedures. The records were reviewed to obtain demographics, frequency distribution of EGS procedures, complications, outcomes, and the risk factors of mortality. Of 4826 patients who had CTS, 57 (1.2%) underwent EGS procedures during the period of 2010-2018. This cohort of patients had 113 CTS and 85 EGS procedures during the same hospitalization. The mean age was 62 years, and 49% were elderly (40% were females). CABG with or without valve replacement was the most common surgery (28%). After surgical consultation for \"acute abdomen\" in the post-CTS phase, the three most common findings on exploratory laparotomy were bowel perforation (23%), massive free fluid leading to abdominal compartment syndrome (19%), and acute cholecystitis (16%). Respiratory failure (46%), acute kidney injury (32%), and multiple organ dysfunction (18%) were the most common hospital-acquired complications. Regarding dispositions, 47% were discharged to an acute rehabilitation center, 10% were discharged to a sub-acute rehabilitation center, and a similar proportion of patients went home (10%). On multivariable logistic regression analysis with backward elimination, age (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.18) and serum proteins (OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-0.998) were independently associated with the odds of mortality after EGS in the immediate CTS phase. Respiratory failure is the most common complication of EGS immediately after CTS. The older the patient and the lower the serum proteins, the higher the odds of mortality in patients who undergo EGS after ETS. ","59":null,"60":"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital abnormality and is characterized by a risk of premature aortic valve disease, predominantly aortic stenosis. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic BAV disease, but, in patients who are unsuitable for surgical aortic valve replacement, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is currently used as an alternative to surgery, although there is no official recommendation for their management, since BAV patients with severe aortic stenosis have been excluded from the major TAVR randomized clinical trials. Patients with BAV stenosis present anatomic challenges for treatment with TAVR. The BAV annulus often has an elliptical shape and is larger than the tricuspid valve, and is more likely to exhibit severe eccentric calcification. In addition, BAV is often associated with a dilated, horizontal ascending aorta, and effaced sinuses. The calcified raphe may also place differential stress on the expansion of the transcatheter valve, increasing the risk of suboptimal positioning and consequently the risk of paravalvular leakage, new pacemaker implantation, new-onset left bundle branch block, and annular rupture. Moreover, coronary obstruction may occur when leaflet fusion results in a longer leaflet. Although some of these challenges have been successfully overcome using new-generation devices, the complication rate is still relatively high and requires a deeper understanding of the patient's specific complex and variable anatomy. Selection of the type and size of the transcatheter valve according to the patient's individual anatomy is critical to achieving successful results. Therefore, given the increasing frequency of BAV stenosis in younger patients, and the worldwide expansion in the application of TAVR in younger and lower surgical-risk patients, preprocedural multimodality imaging involving CT scan and three-dimensional echocardiography is mandatory to understand the complex and variable anatomy of BAV disease and improve both procedural results and short- and long-term outcomes in these patients.","61":"Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy requires a precise anatomical dissection to mobilise the right and proximal transverse mesocolon, following the avascular fusion planes of Toldt and Fredet. Fredet's plane is crucial to the preparation of the origin of vessels. Easy access to Fredet's and Toldt's fasciae can be obtained through the \"duodenal window\", a flimsy area of the root of the proximal transverse mesocolon, the margins of which are the right border of the superior mesenteric pedicle, the ileocolic pedicle, the right colic pedicle and the marginal artery. We propose that dissection of the duodenal window should be the first step in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, to obtain easy access to the duodenopancreatic plane and prepare the fascia. This \"duodenal window-first\" technique has been applied in 45 laparoscopic right hemicolectomies and 14 laparoscopic extended right hemicolectomies, with only two conversions to open surgery. The duodenal window was easily identified in all but 3 cases with significant visceral obesity. No significant intra- or postoperative morbidity was recorded in these cases and the median postoperative length of stay was 4 days. All resections were R0 and an adequate number of retrieved lymph nodes were obtained in almost all cases. The duodenal window-first approach is a feasible and safe technique to standardise the first steps of radical laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, allowing prompt and complete anatomical identification and dissection. ","62":null,"63":"Disturbed wound healing is a significant problem in patients after cardiac surgery. Problems with deep sternal wound healing are rare, but can be quite difficult to treat. Furthermore, the therapy is highly expensive and consumes many of the patient's personal resources. Another major obstacle in this patient group is reinfection after secondary wound closure. We examined how to prevent early reinfection through the use of growth factors in combination with local antibiotics. Our study included 232 patients with a deep sternal wound healing problem. After initial vacuum therapy, we planned secondary wound closure. During wound closure, we used only platelet-rich fibrin in a PRF group (109 patients). In another group (123 patients), we covered the wounds intraoperatively with a combination of PRF and local antibiotics (PRF CoDelivery). All patients were observed for 30 days for signs of early surgical site infection. After 30 days, 22 patients (20.2%) in the PRF group showed a persistent problem with wound healing with or without reinfection. In contrast, only 12 patients (9.8%) in the PRF CoDelivery group had this problem (p=0.023 PRF vs. PRF CoDelivery). The combination of growth factors and antibiotics was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of early reinfection and thus can be expected to have a positive impact on wound healing in complicated scenarios. Furthermore, the combination of PRF and local antibiotics was easy to use. Further studies are needed to verify these initial findings. ","64":"More than 400,000 cases of ventral hernia (VH) are repaired each year in the U.S. This condition is a major problem with significant morbidly and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate independent predictors of in-hospital mortality for patients with a primary diagnosis of VH who were admitted emergently. Non-elderly adults (age 18-64 years) with ventral hernias that required emergency admission were analyzed using the National Inpatient Sample database, 2005-2014. Demographics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected. The relationships between mortality and predictors were assessed using a multivariable logistic regression model. Overall, 48,539 patients were identified. The mean (SD) age for both males and females was 50 (9.6). Overall mortality was low (316 or 0.7%). Males accounted for 35% of the total sample and 45% of all mortalities (p &lt;0.001). The mean (SD) hospital length of stay (HLOS) was 4.9 (6.3) and 12.3 (20.6) days in surviving and deceased patients (p &lt;0.001), respectively. Approximately 1.1% of surviving and 6% of deceased patients had gangrene (p &lt;0.001). Intestinal obstruction was observed in 70% of surviving and 83% of deceased patients (p &lt;0.001). While a vast majority of the patients (40,602) were operated on, 8,023 patients were not; 0.7% and 0.4% died, respectively. The mean (SD) HLOS was 5.30 (6.99) days in patients who underwent an operation and 2.97 (2.96) days in those who did not (P &lt;0.0001). Time to operation was 0.81 (1.92) days in surviving and 1.34 (2.42) days in deceased patients (p &lt;0.001). In the final multivariable regression model for patients who underwent an operation, age, male sex, presence of gangrene or obstruction, and longer time to operation were the main risk factors for mortality. For patients who did not undergo an operation, only HLOS and presence of obstruction were the main risk factors for mortality. Male sex, presence of gangrene or obstruction at the presentation, and delayed operation were shown to be risk factors for mortality in adult patients with ventral hernia admitted emergently. ","65":"Traumatic aortic injuries are devastating events in terms of high mortality and morbidity in most survivors. We aimed to compare the outcomes of endovascular repair (ER) vs. open repair (OR) in the treatment of traumatic aortic injuries. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched. Postoperative mortality was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, hospital length of stay, operating time, paraplegia, stroke, acute renal failure, and reoperation rate. The Mantel-Haenszel method (random-effects model) with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR (95% CI)), and the inverse variance method with the mean difference (MD (95% CI)), were used to measure the effects of continuous and categorical variables, respectively. A total of 49 studies involving 12,857 patients were included. Postoperative mortality was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0.459). Among secondary outcomes, the paraplegia rate was significantly lower after ER (p=0.032). Other secondary endpoints such as ICU length of stay (p=0.329), hospital length of stay (p=0.192), operating time (p=0.973), stroke rate (p=0.121), ARF rate (p=0.928), and reoperation rate (p=0.643) did not significantly differ between the two groups. This meta-analysis found that ER was associated with a reduced paraplegia rate compared to OR for the management of traumatic aortic injury. ","66":"Endovascular intervention has become first-line treatment for the majority of atherosclerotic lesions associated with peripheral artery disease. Traditionally, treatment modalities have included various types of balloon angioplasty and stenting. However, recent technological advancements have introduced the concept of endovascular lithotripsy as a novel alternative to angioplasty and stenting. This new addition to the armamentarium of surgeons and interventionalists has the potential to alter the treatment paradigm for patients with complex peripheral artery disease.","67":"Low preoperative haemoglobin is frequently observed in heart surgery patients and is associated with a significant decrease in haemoglobin between post-operative days 2 and 3, known as haemoglobin drift. Overall, these patients tend to receive many RBC transfusions. Since iron homeostasis is often impaired in these patients, restoration of iron availability might override iron-restricted erythropoiesis. However, reduced tolerance to oral iron salts has limited this strategy to intravenous iron administration. The purpose of this study was to assess whether preoperative supplementation with oral sucrosomial iron, a new iron-delivery technology with improved tolerance and bioavailability, might be an effective strategy for this patient population. One thousand consecutive patients were randomized and received either a one-month course of sucrosomial iron (60 mg\/day) or no treatment prior to elective heart surgery at a single high-volume centre (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03560687). Primary end-points were haemoglobin concentration on the day of hospital admittance and number of blood transfusions. Secondary end-points were haemoglobin drift, tolerance of treatment and cost-effectiveness of sucrosomial iron administration. Baseline haemoglobin in the treatment group was higher (by 0.67 g\/dL; p&lt;0.001) than that in the control group. The percentage of patients in the treatment group who required transfusion (35.4%) was half that in the control group (64.6%). The average number of transfused units per operation was 0.95 vs. 2.03 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Haemoglobin drift was substantially similar in the two groups, and the tolerability of treatment was excellent (98%). The overall cost of treatment was 156 Euros less in the treatment group, expressed as a raw cost of transfusion. In elective heart surgery, routine preoperative sucrosomial iron administration seems to be a safe, well-tolerated and cost-effective strategy to increase preoperative haemoglobin and reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusions. ","68":"Laparoscopic diverted one-anastomosis gastric bypass (D-OAGB) is a bariatric procedure combining the principles of restriction, malabsorption, and other factors to induce weight loss. It is achieved by creating a narrow, long gastric pouch and bypassing a part of the small bowel (biliopancreatic limb). D-OAGB was first described by Dr. Ribero in 2013 and is technically a variation of the very heterogeneous group of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operations. There are different technical variants to perform D-OAGB and to organize pre- and postoperative care. The following article is based on the approach to bariatric surgery as taken at the Department of General Surgery at the Medical University of Vienna. This article focuses on patient preparation before bariatric\/metabolic surgery with mandatory and optional preoperative examinations to find the surgical procedure best suited for each individual patient and to decrease the patient's risk. The surgical technique of D-OAGB itself, including positioning of the patient and related technical highlights, as well as the specifics of the postoperative course, are described. D-OAGB is an effective procedure for patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux for adequate weight loss and remission of comorbidities with a low risk of malnutrition. For D-OAGB to be successful, important technical steps, such as creating a narrow, long pouch, exact length of the biliopancreatic and alimentary limb, and additional hiatoplasty (if necessary), should be taken. In terms of the postoperative course, regular checkups are vital to ensure desirable outcome in the long-term follow up and early detection of adverse developments.","69":"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established therapy for severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis (AS) in patients at high and intermediate risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Current evidence also suggests at least non-inferiority of TAVI in low-risk patients compared to SAVR. However, there are special subsets of patients and anatomical circumstances in which TAVI is traditionally considered a suboptimal treatment strategy due to procedure inherent increased risks (e.g., rupture of cardiac chambers in patients with severe calcifications of the left ventricular outflow tract, valve migration in very large aortic annuli). One of these special subsets is bicuspid AS. Bicuspid aortic valve disease is the most common congenital heart defect and most frequent reason for AS in patients &lt;70 years of age. Bicuspid aortic valve pathology is characterized by special anatomical complexities like asymmetrical cusp proportion and calcium distribution, a more pronounced annular ellipticity compared to tricuspid aortic valves and concomitant dilation of the thoracic aorta. These factors have led physicians to traditionally indicate TAVI more reluctantly in those patients in the past. In this article, current evidence for TAVI for bicuspid AS is discussed and technical challenges are highlighted.","70":null,"71":"The development of new surgical techniques and devices, as well as the improvements in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy enabled intersphincteric resection (ISR), has reduced permanent colostomy usage. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term oncological and functional outcomes of patients who underwent partial ISR for rectal cancer located less than 5cm from the anal verge. A series of 106 consecutive patients with very low rectal cancer underwent curative partial ISR from January 2006 to September 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. One-hundred-three (97%) of 106 patients received neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local recurrence (LR) rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. The Wexner incontinence score and Kirwan classification were used to evaluate patients' functional results. The median follow up was 60 months (range, 18-174). The estimated five-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 89% and 81.6%, respectively. Five-year local recurrence and distant metastasis rates were 6.6% and 10.4%, respectively. There was no in-hospital and 30-day mortality. The median Wexner score was 9 (range, 0-20) for 72 patients. Age (&lt;65 years, p=0.027) and gender (male, p=0.019) had a positive effect on functional outcomes after surgery. One and five years colostomy-free survival rates were 96% and 89%, respectively. Intersphincteric resection techniques are feasible for patients with very low rectal cancer, providing good oncological and functional outcomes. ","72":"In the longstanding pursuit of improving alignment and functional outcome in knee arthroplasty, technological evolution leading to robotic systems has now been introduced to the mainstream orthopaedic surgical world. This technology facilitates greater accuracy in implant placement, protects soft tissues, and achieves better balancing, while also allowing the potential to be more bone conserving. Robots currently in use in orthopaedic surgery can be classified into passive or haptic semi-active surgeon-guided systems. Using a virtual model of the knee joint, the robot system guides bone cuts and facilitates precise implant placement. In addition, small changes to bone resection can be made permitting deformity correction and balancing. This is achieved on-table by dynamic referencing, which enables live objective measurement of range of movements, stability, and gap balance throughout the range of motion. Preservation of ligaments and their unnecessary releases has been shown to reduce time to recovery and allow potentially better knee kinematics. Advances in robot technology in knee arthroplasty have led to the development of a variety of systems to execute the multiple steps in this procedure including using computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, plain radiographs (image based), or image-free systems. The combination of these images and on-table registering of bony landmarks allow the creation of a 3-dimensional (3D) virtual, but accurate, model of the knee during surgery. The various systems apply sculpting tools, burrs, or cutting saws to deliver the bone cuts or allow robots to guide placement of cutting blocks to ensure accurate pre-planned bone cuts. Intraoperative adjustments to bone resections can be made using a variety of tracker systems to measure joint movement and ligament balance to correct any malalignments while performing the surgery, so compound errors in the technique are avoided. Data from comparative studies suggest improved accuracy in implant placement in patients compared to conventional knee arthroplasty. Benefits of robot assistance have been demonstrated both in total knee arthroplasty and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Recent studies show a trend toward improved patient-reported outcomes and better patient satisfactions as well as earlier recoveries following robot-assisted knee arthroplasty. Early survivorship data has also shown a better survivorship with robot-assisted knee arthroplasty, although long-term survivorship data are awaited. An increase in familiarity, availability, and demand for this technology is driving innovations aimed at delivering a personalized approach to knee arthroplasty. This chapter will discuss the latest advances and look at the clinical research in relation to the robotic technological advancement comparing some of the different system approaches.","73":"Surgical-site infections are potential complications of total joint arthroplasties. Many strategies, ranging from preoperative to postoperative, have been developed in an attempt to mitigate this morbidity. Biofilms have been implicated in difficulties of treatment. Therefore, antimicrobials have been increasingly used to combat these problems. In this report, we will summarize different protocols which utilize a new antimicrobial solution. Providing surgeons with an effective prevention option for these infections is crucial for positive outcomes and the continued advancement in the practice of total joint arthroplasty.","74":null,"75":"Caval filters are placed in the inferior vena cava (IVC) to prevent pulmonary thromboembolism in patients with deep vein thrombosis. If there is no indication for thrombo-embolic risk prevention, the filter can be removed to reduce potential filter-related complications. Advanced endovascular techniques are frequently used to retrieve IVC filters. We describe an alternative filter-removal technique for use when standard techniques are not practicable. In our method, the filter hook is embedded within the IVC wall. To retrieve it, a long introducer is inserted; a guidewire and the \"loop snare\" retrieval system are then advanced through it with a coaxial system and positioned below the filter at the level of the common iliac vein confluence. The guidewire is then passed through the loop, creating a \"sling\" around the filter which allows the application of traction from the bottom upwards, releasing the hook from the wall. The loop is then held under tension with the filter aligned in the IVC lumen, and the introducer is advanced distally to completely cover the filter, allowing complete retrieval of the filter without damaging the vessel walls. This modified Sling technique is a safe and feasible method for complicated IVC filter retrieval.","76":null,"77":"The objective was to compare the two-year ultrasonographic outcomes in a consecutive series of patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATr), either treated surgically or nonoperatively. This is a prospective, single-center, consecutive series. All patients presenting with acute ATr were included and divided into two groups: surgical or nonoperative groups. At two years, patients were evaluated clinically and sonographically. The parameters studied were length of the tendon on the rupture side (LTCR) and on the contralateral side (LTCS), ratio LTCR\/LTCS, maximum anteroposterior diameter on the rupture side (DAPMR), maximum surface area on the rupture side (SMR), maximum anteroposterior diameter on the contralateral side (DAPMS), and maximum surface area on the contralateral side (SMS). Morphological changes in tendon structure were reported. Thirty patients were included. No difference in functional score was observed between both groups. In the nonoperative group, there is a significant difference between: LTCR and LTCS; DAPMR and DAPMS. In the surgical group, there is a significant difference between: LTCR and LTCS; DAPMR and DAPMS; SMR and SMS. There is a significant difference when comparing SMR\/SMS between both groups. In terms of morphological changes in tendon structure, there were differences. At two years, there was no difference in functional outcomes between the two groups. In both groups, AT were lengthened and thickened without differences between groups. There was a significant difference when comparing the ratio SMR\/SMS between groups. Ultrasound examination demonstrated different morphological changes in tendon structure depending on the treatment performed. ","78":"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are among the most common articular injuries in sports and can be responsible for knee instability and reduced articular performance. Treatment can be either conservative or operative, and ligament reconstruction may be carried out using biological autologous grafts or synthetic materials. Several studies have sought to evaluate and compare functional results in treated patients. However, there is still very limited information available on long-term follow-up and clinical outcomes are generally evaluated only using subjective scores. In this study, we assessed long-term functional and biomechanical results in patients treated with biologic and synthetic ligaments using objective measures. Patients were divided according to whether ACL reconstruction was biologic or synthetic. The Tegner activity scale was used before and after surgery. Post-operative subjective scores such as the IKDC Questionnaire and the Tegner-Lysholm score were also recorded. The Y Balance Test was used to assess global stability and mobility of the lower limb. Kinematic Rapid Assessment (KiRA) was used to evidence and estimate ligamentous laxity during the Pivot Shift and Lachman tests. Clinical subjective patient and operator-dependent scores as well as objective biomechanical findings were similar and comparable in patients treated with biologic and synthetic reconstructions after more than 10 years of use. Both synthetic and biological tendon grafts may represent good reconstructive approaches to treat torn ACLs, and remain effective even for a long period of time if implanted in suitable target patients. ","79":"This study retrospectively reviewed results of simultaneous (SIM) inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and separate (SEP) IVC filter placement with open pulmonary thromboembolectomy (PTE) in pulmonary embolism and its clinical outcomes. From November 2006 to May 2014, 23 patients (14 females and 9 males; median age 58 years; range, 21-88 years) underwent emergent PTE for submassive (12) or massive (11) pulmonary embolism (PE). All had a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan and echocardiography consistent with right ventricular (RV) strain. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass times and temperatures; chest tube outputs; length of stay; perioperative complications; and survival were compared between groups. There were 13 patients in the SIM group and 10 in the SEP group. PE consisted of 14 acute (60.9%) and nine acute on chronic (39.1%). There were seven deaths (30.4%). Median follow up was 44 days (range, 2-2204 days). Follow up was 81% complete in surviving patients. Actuarial survival at one and three years was 83% for the SIM group and 43% for the SEP group, respectively. There were no differences in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times and temperatures, chest tube outputs, or length of stay between groups. Using multivariable logistic regression, we found SIM was associated with increased survival (p=0.09). Further analysis showed patients &gt;55 years in the SEP group were at significantly higher risk of death (hazard ratio [HR]=7.1:1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55, 32.5, p=0.011). IVC filter placement can be performed simultaneously and safely at PTE. Age &gt;55 years and PTE with IVC filter placed separately were at significantly higher risk of death. A larger cohort is needed to evaluate efficacy of simultaneous IVC filter placement and PTE. ","80":"Outpatient primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) accounts for approximately 8% of all total hip arthroplasties (THA) performed annually in the United States. As of 2020, Medicare removed THA from its inpatient-only list, allowing reimbursement as an outpatient procedure. This study aimed to determine whether outpatient primary THA is a potential alternative to inpatient procedures by assessing: 1) 90-day postoperative complications; 2) readmission rates; and 3) total costs of care. Using a national database, a matched case-control study was conducted of primary THAs performed between January 1, 2008 and March 31, 2018. Outpatient primary THAs were identified (n=10,463) and matched in a 1:5 ratio to inpatient primary THAs (n=52,306) for age, sex, and comorbidities. Outcomes assessed were 90-day medical complications, readmissions, and associated total costs of care. Baseline demographics were compared using Pearson's chi-squared analyses, with multivariate logistic regressions to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Patients undergoing outpatient THA had fewer 90-day complications (9.3 vs. 11.9%; OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.87, p&lt;0.0001) relative to the inpatient cohort. Ninety-day readmission rates between outpatient and inpatient THAs were similar (4.1 vs. 4.8%; OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.03, p=0.166). Ninety-day costs were significantly lower for the outpatient cohort ($2,650.00 vs. $19,299.00, p&lt;0.0001). Our study includes a large sample size of outpatient primary THAs and is the first to provide data quantifying cost differences relative to inpatient THAs. Our results suggest, in certain populations, that outpatient primary THAs are a safe alternative to inpatient procedures with the potential to decrease healthcare costs. ","81":"Over the past 20 years, various alternative cervical minimally invasive (partly endoscopically assisted) and extracervical endoscopic (partly robot-assisted) approaches have been developed. All of these alternative access methods aim at optimizing the cosmetic results. In principle, the indication for the use of alternative access procedures does not differ from that for conventional surgery. Nonetheless, appropriate experience in traditional thyroid surgery and suitable patient selection, taking into account thyroid volumes and the underlying pathology, are important prerequisites. General contraindications for an alternative approach are large goiter with symptoms of compression, advanced thyroid carcinoma, recurrent interventions or previous radiotherapy in the operating area. The alternative surgical approaches to the thyroid can be divided into cervical minimally invasive, extracervical endoscopic (robot-assisted) and transoral procedures. This article gives an overview of the clinically used alternative approaches in thyroid surgery. The desire for an optimal cosmetic result should not be prioritized over patient safety. Only a few alternative procedures (minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy, transaxillary robot-assisted thyroidectomy) can currently be viewed as a useful addition to conventional thyroid surgery, even when in responsible, experienced hands for a selected group of patients.","82":"Thermal ablative therapies (laser, radiofrequency ablation, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation) are often used during rigid bronchoscopy for the treatment of central airway obstructions (CAO). An airway fire is a feared complication that can occur during endobronchial thermal ablation. This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. A total of 175 patients were reviewed undergoing rigid bronchoscopy in the operating room and bronchoscopy suite requiring manual hand jet ventilation and thermal therapy between September 2014 and September 2018. The study objective was to determine the safety of manual hand jet ventilation during endobronchial thermal therapies with rigid bronchoscopy. Over a five-year period, 175 patients underwent endobronchial thermal therapy during rigid bronchoscopy with manual hand jet ventilation for the treatment CAOs. Immediately prior to thermal therapy activation, jet ventilation was paused. No incidences (0\/175) of airway fires occurred despite immediate delivery of thermal energy following a jet ventilation hold. Results of our study show that performing thermal ablative therapy during rigid bronchoscopy with jet ventilation using a breath-hold technique is safe.

Therefore, the purpose of this article is to clearly and concisely describe the preoperative planning and surgical technique for using one version of robotic assistance, specifically the MAKO platform (MAKO Surgical Corp. [Stryker], Fort Lauderdale, Florida), for a standard osteoarthritic knee with a varus deformity that is commonly encountered by joint arthroplasty surgeons.","85":"In Part I of this three-part series, the author reviewed the importance of resectoscopic surgery and the many advantages it provides to the patient and to the minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon. In Part I, we reviewed the obstacles to mastering this 30-year-old technology and how the motivated surgeon can overcome them. Although many basic resectoscopic procedures have been supplanted by global endometrial ablation (GEA) devices and hysteroscopic morcellators (HMs), the limitations of these restrictive technologies are quickly evident as the surgeon encounters increasingly complex and demanding cases. In Part II, the author examines intermediate-level procedures that cannot be managed with global endometrial ablation or hysteroscopic morcellators-endomyometrial resection (EMR), the resection of larger and multiple submucous leiomyomas and endometrial polyps, the incision of uterine septae, and the management of severe cervical stenosis. In Part II, we will also describe how to incorporate ultrasound guidance into one's surgical armamentarium and its role in assisting the minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon in the safe execution of these more challenging cases.","86":"The purpose of this review is to evaluate the relevance of vascular calcification as a potential risk factor for anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery. The Embase, Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane databases and Google Scholar were systematically searched. Studies that assessed calcification of the aorta-iliac trajectory in patients who underwent colorectal surgery were included. An independent patient data meta-analysis was performed as follows: based on the heterogeneity of the study population, a \"random-effects model\" or \"fixed-effects model\" was used to perform a multivariable logistic regression and calculate pooled Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-test and I2-test. From a total of 457 articles retrieved, eight fell within the scope of the review, with a total of 2010 patients. Anastomotic leakage was found at a mean rate of 11.1% (SD 4.9%). In these eight studies, four different calcification scoring methods were used, which made a single structured meta-analysis not feasible. Therefore, an independent patient data meta-analysis on the most frequently used calcification scoring method was performed, including three studies with a total of 396 patients. After multivariable analyses, no significant association was found between anastomotic leakage and the amount of calcification in the aorta-iliac trajectory. The remaining three scoring methods were evaluated. In four of the five studies, vascular calcification was associated with anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery. In contrast to previous studies, an individual patient data meta-analysis found no association between calcification and anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery after multivariable analysis that considered a single calcification measurement method. In addition, this study demonstrated several scoring methods for arterial calcification and the need for a standardized technique. Therefore, the authors would recommend prospective studies using a calcification scoring method that includes grade of stenosis due to its potential to preoperatively improve perfusion by endovascular treatment. ","87":"Due to medical and surgical progress, liver transplantation (LT) is is nowadays a routine treatment for terminal liver failure and hepatic malignancies. However, in recent years there has been a change in the indications for LT. Especially in western industrialized countries, the use of LT for chronic hepatis B and hepatitis C cirrhosis is continuously decreasing since the introduction of effective antiviral drugs. Liver cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis are now among the leading indications for LT. Due to tremendous progress in oncology, immunology, and technical aspects, multidisciplinary cancer treatment increasingly includes LT for non-HCC hepatobiliary malignancies. Excellent 5-year survival rates of 75 to 80% can now be achieved after LT. However, in patients with liver cirrhosis, the implementation of a 'sickest first' principle for liver allocation has led to an increasing number of critically ill patients undergoing liver transplantation. This results in an increased morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. Moreover, donor characteristics have markedly shifted to less ideal grafts due to an increasing shortage of donor organs in many countries. In this context, normothermic machine perfusion with oxygenated blood components using pulsatile flow has been shown to reduce liver damage despite a prolonged preservation time and might be able to provide viability testing for otherwise discarded organs. With favorable donor and recipient conditions, excellent long-term results can be obtained with a 10-year survival rate of close to 70%. However, in patients with a high MELD score (&gt;30), survival rates markedly decrease by 12-18%. Future research should focus on optimization of organ allocation, optimization of immunosuppression including tolerance induction, and on increasing the donor organ pool to further improve and the numbers of successful LT.","88":"Surgical-site infections (SSIs) are among the most difficult-to-manage complications after lower extremity total joint arthroplasty (TJA). While the rates of most implant-related complications have decreased over time due to improvements in prosthetic materials and surgical techniques, the incidence of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) continues to increase. They place a tremendous economic burden on healthcare systems that is projected to reach $1.8 billion by the year 2030. A number of perioperative infection mitigation strategies exist that are often implemented concurrently to minimize the risk of these complications. A multicenter randomized controlled trial is underway to evaluate the efficacy of a bundled care program for the prevention of PJIs in lower extremity TJA. This bundle includes five infection-reduction strategies that are used pre-, peri-, and postoperatively, including: (1) povidone-iodine skin preparation and nasal decolonization; (2) iodine-alcohol surgical prepping solution; (3) iodophor-impregnated incise drapes; (4) forced-air warming blankets; and (5) negative pressure wound therapy for select patients. The aim of this review is to describe these products and their appropriate usage, review the available literature evaluating their use, and compare them with other commercially available products. Based on the available literature, each of these strategies appear to be important components for SSI-prevention protocols. We believe that implementing all five of these mitigation strategies concurrently will lead to a synergistic effect for infection control following lower extremity TJA.","89":"The two current strategies for robotic-assisted, surgical myocardial revascularization are minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) and totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting (TECAB). We discuss the rationale underlying the benefits of robotic assistance in surgical myocardial revascularization, and detail the technical steps to safely and effectively perform these two procedures.","90":"Infections are one of the most devastating complications that occur after lower extremity total joint arthroplasty or any surgical procedure. As such, it has become a major priority to reduce them through various preoperative strategies. Popular prophylactic antimicrobials include alcohol-based solutions, povidone iodine, as well as combinations of chlorhexidine-based products to address an individual's microbial load on the skin. Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum biocide with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The use of chlorhexidine cloths may be a choice over solutions, since some studies have shown that they can reduce lower extremity infection rates by greater than two-thirds. In this report, we will describe the scientific basis for the dual application technique of these cloths, as well as our general recommendations for usage for lower extremity arthroplasties and other surgical procedures. Multiple studies have demonstrated their efficacy, with a prospective randomized study of joint arthroplasties demonstrating a 2.9% deep infection rate without their use versus a reduction to 0.4%. In conclusion, we believe that these cloths are appropriate for use in all hip and knee lower extremity arthroplasties as well as other surgical procedures.","91":"Colorectal cancer remains the 3rd most common cancer diagnosed among men and women in the United States. With improved screening, premalignant rectal lesions and rectal cancers are being detected at earlier stages. In addition, the use of neoadjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy has led to downstaging of larger lesions. There is growing interest among colorectal surgeons in local excision with organ preservation for patients with rectal cancer. There are multiple platforms for local excision of rectal cancers, including transanal excision (TAE), transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS). TAMIS was developed as an affordable platform that uses conventional laparoscopic equipment familiar to many colorectal surgeons. TAMIS allows for full-thickness benign or malignant lesion excision in any quadrant without the need for patient repositioning. The literature has shown that, for appropriately selected patients, TAMIS provides superior excision quality compared to TAE. Furthermore, TAMIS has oncologic outcomes equivalent to TEM at a fraction of the cost. Recently, robotic TAMIS has been introduced, which takes advantage of the articulating instruments of the robotic platform without the need for a skilled assistant. This article will cover multiple technical aspects for TAMIS including patient selection and preparation, technical tips for successful excision and defect closure, and recent advances, including robotic TAMIS.","92":"To preliminarily assess the effectiveness of a highly viscous antibiotic-loaded hydrogel used as a coating for the prevention of superficial and deep Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) after laminectomy and fusion in instrumented vertebral surgery. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis on 73 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from June 2018 to December 2019 for degenerative spinal disorders (DSD) or traumatic fractures with segmental instability. Patients received the antibiotic-loaded hydrogel over the implants perioperatively and were observed postoperatively for 12 months. Postoperative evaluations showed no adverse events in the study population. None of the patients reported significant pain or functional limitation after surgery. Post-surgically, computed tomography scans confirmed the correct positioning of instruments. At 12 months follow-up, no infection was recorded in the overall population. This retrospective investigation highlights the importance of adopting measures to prevent SSIs in instrumented vertebral surgery. The intraoperative local use of an antibiotic-loaded hydrogel, complementary to systemic antibiotic therapy, appears to minimize the risk of superficial and deep infection. ","93":"Prior publications have demonstrated chemical and physical alteration of hernia mesh analyzed after explantation from the body. The specific alteration documented is oxidative degradation of polypropylene mesh fibers. An animal study recently published has demonstrated that adipose tissue attachment is present instead of reparative fibrous tissue infiltration in an average of 10.9-18.9% of the intramesh healing for a variety of clinically used knitted polypropylene mesh products; 8.0% for knitted polyester meshes. This study also found that in comparison to the knitted mesh products, non-woven polypropylene mesh reduced adipose tissue attachment to 1% or less, which was a statistically significant difference. Samples of explanted polypropylene mesh from eight patients were analyzed for the presence of adipose tissue attachment, reparative fibrous tissue infiltration, and oxidative changes. Greater adipose tissue attachment areas were compared with areas of greater reparative fibrous tissue infiltration for evidence of oxidative changes in the mesh to determine if the areas of higher adipose tissue attachment correlated with an increase in oxidative changes. Intra mesh healing of clinically explanted knitted meshes demonstrated adipose tissue content from 0.0% to 49.1% per analyzed segment. The oxidation index, a measure of the degree of oxidative degradation in that portion of the mesh, was higher in seven of the eight areas of greater adipose tissue attachment than areas of greater reparative fibrous tissue infiltration. Adipose tissue attachment does occur in knitted and woven polypropylene hernia meshes.

However, the rate of false positives and false negatives remains unknown. This is a single institution prospective single-arm study. Patients with suspected hepatic or pancreatic malignancies were intravenously injected with ICG one to three days prior to their scheduled surgical therapy. At the beginning of the procedure, the liver was assessed with fluorescence imaging and all identified lesions were biopsied and evaluated. Twenty-three patients were enrolled from April 2015 through February 2016. Fifteen patients with confirmed malignancy had adequate fluorescence imaging evaluation of the liver; 10 with pancreatic primary malignancies and five with hepatic primaries. Fluorescence imaging was the only modality that identified nine concerning hepatic lesions, all of which were benign on pathology examination. Out of 11 malignant hepatic masses, six were visible on fluorescence imaging. Out of nine benign hepatic lesions, five were visible. No side effects or complications of the fluorescence imaging were encountered. The sensitivity for ICG fluorescence was 45.5%, the specificity 21.2%, the positive predictive value 25%, and the negative predictive value 40%. Intraoperative hepatic assessment with ICG fluorescence imaging to identify malignancy in the liver is feasible and safe. However, in this study the significant number of false positives limit the utility of the technique. Our preliminary data do not support its routine use for detection of malignancies in the liver. ","96":"Over the past three decades, there has been a growing interest in the use of oxygen therapy to promote wound healing. Although the most commonly recognized oxygen therapy for the treatment of chronic wounds is hyperbaric oxygen therapy, topical oxygen therapy has a greater level of evidence supporting its use in chronic wound care. Still, it is imperative that these two treatment modalities be recognized not merely as competitors, but as distinct therapeutic entities. Through personal experience and a thorough literature review, we investigated the use of topical oxygen therapy in the management of chronic wounds. The benefits of using topical oxygen therapy have been demonstrated in patients with diabetic foot ulcers, ischemic ulcers, post-revascularization ulcers, and pressure ulcers. There are several topical oxygen devices currently on the market that are versatile, relatively low-risk, and generally well-tolerated by patients. While these devices have been used in the treatment of chronic wounds at different locations and of different etiologies, other uses of these devices are still being investigated. Topical oxygen therapy is yet another tool in our arsenal to be used in treating difficult to heal chronic wounds and could potentially be used more readily.","97":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the setting of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) presents more inherent complexities than routine primary THA for osteoarthritis. These include acetabular bone deficiency, limb length discrepancy (LLD), and abnormal femoral anteversion. Three-dimensional planning and robot-assisted (RA) bone preparation may simplify these complex procedures and make them more reproducible. The purpose of this study was to evaluate radiographic and clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients who had DDH and underwent an RA THA. We retrospectively analyzed 26 DDH patients who underwent RA THA by a single surgeon between 2013 and 2019. Their mean age was 54 years (range, 29 to 72 years) and mean follow up was approximately two years. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, clinical scores, Crowe classifications, and complications. There were thirteen Crowe I and seven Crowe II DDH hips, who were routinely managed with primary cementless implants. Two patients who had Crowe III and four patients who had Crowe IV DDH were also identified. All hips were reconstructed with cementless hemispherical acetabular components with or without the use of screws, but no acetabular augments or bulk allografts. Implants allowing control of femoral anteversion were selected in 23.1% of cases, including all six cases with Crowe III or IV dysplasia, and the need for these implants was uniformly identified using preoperative information about femoral version provided by the three-dimensional planning software. No patient was managed with a shortening femoral osteotomy. Postoperative radiographs were examined for LLD, center of rotation (COR), cup position (inclination and anteversion), and component osseous-integration. Mean radiographic LLD was 1.7mm (range, -9 to +14) in patients who had Crowe I DDH, and there was no clinical LLDs greater than 5mm observed. Although patients who had Crowe II and greater DDH had a mean radiographic LLD of -11.6mm (range, -26 to +2.2), again no clinical LLD greater than 5mm was observed other than one patient who had bilateral Crowe II DDH in whom 10mm of clinical lengthening was accepted at the index arthroplasty with the plan to match lengths when her contralateral THA was performed. There were no cases of dislocation or acetabular fixation failure. One patient who had a femoral deformity and an intra-osseous blade plate from a prior femoral osteotomy suffered a failure of femoral osseous-integration, resulting in revision. A 32-point increase in mean modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) was found (p=0.002), from 48 points preoperatively to 80 points postoperatively. RA THA provides an excellent option for the arthroplasty surgeon to both preoperatively localize and characterize the acetabular deficiency, while providing a targeted, optimal, and secure placement of the components intraoperatively. Our results suggest favorable outcomes when compared to previous research on manual THA in DDH. Further studies, including comparative analyses, could discern possible advantages over traditional THA without robotic assistance in DDH. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the setting of developmental dysplasia presents more inherent complexities than routine primary THA. Robotic-assisted THA may simplify these complex procedures.

However, despite its popularity, the occurrence of intraoperative organ damage has not necessarily decreased. To avoid intraoperative bile duct injury in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is one of the most popular procedures in endoscopic surgery, we are developing a laparoscopic surgical system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to identify four anatomical landmarks (cystic duct of the gallbladder, common bile duct, lower surface of hepatic S4, and Rouviere's sulcus, related to \"Calot's triangle\") in real time during surgery. The development process consists of 5 steps: 1) identification of anatomical landmarks, 2) collection and creation of teaching data, 3) annotation and deep learning, 4) validation of development model, and 5) actual clinical performance evaluation. At present, anatomical landmarks can be identified with high accuracy in an actual clinical performance test in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, whereas issues for practical clinical use, such as a need to recognize the scene of surgical steps and surgical difficulties related to inflammation of the gallbladder, have also been clarified. The development of an AI-navigation system for endoscopic surgery, which could identify anatomical landmarks in real time during surgery, could be expected to support surgeons' decisions, reduce surgical complications, and contribute to improving the quality of surgical treatments.","100":"Debridement is a standard part of wound care that is used on both acute and chronic wounds. Current methods of wound debridement include: autolytic based on the natural immune response, surgical, enzymatic based on application of exogenous proteases, mechanical using water jets and ultrasound, and biological using live organisms such as maggots. The choice of individual methods involves a trade-off between speed of treatment, selectivity, and pain. Irreversible electroporation via the application of pulsed electric fields has been used as a novel approach for deep tissue ablation, sometimes in conjunction with chemotherapy, as in the case of tumors, and also in cases where high precision is needed in otherwise very fragile tissues, such as for treating diabetic neuropathy and in epicardial atrial ablation. This method could be readily extended to wound care as it is both rapid and relatively painless, and it is also effective at decreasing bacterial load and clearing biofilms. Furthermore, the process primarily targets cells leaving the extracellular matrix relatively intact, thus providing a suitable natural scaffold for host cellular invasion and regrowth. A unique aspect of the use of pulsed electric fields is that around the region where ablation is perfomed, electric fields of lower energy are dissipated into the healthy tissue. There is a range of electric fields that are known to stimulate cellular functions, in particular migration and proliferation, and that may contribute to the healing process after electroporation. While irreversible electroporation is a potentially useful alternative to other debridement methods, future clinical application awaits technological advances in electrode design that will enable precise delivery of the therapy in wounds of various sizes and depths.","101":"A critical appraisal of the original procedure of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) for varicose veins. Evaluation of all practical aspects of the procedure. EVLA procedures are performed in a strictly ambulatory setting with tumescent local anesthesia (TLA). Technical improvements have resulted in the need for fewer incisions and re-punctures, less ecchymosis, and fewer technical failures. Administration of an appropriate amount of TLA via an infusion pump has reduced the risk of nerve injury, administration time, and pain during the procedure. Use of a 1470-nm diode laser and a radial fiber have significantly improved patient satisfaction and reduced the occurrence of complications such as pain, tightness, ecchymosis, and the need for additional procedures. Lastly, there are only a few indications left for high ligation and stripping. Over the past 20 years, EVLA has evolved into an effective, cost-efficient, and safe procedure that provides high patient satisfaction.

Despite telehealth's existence, there was no prior need to fully realize its potential. Recently, technological innovations in orthopaedic surgery have assisted in making this modality more useful. However, it is important to continually educate the medical community regarding these technologies and their interplay to improve patient care. Therefore, our purpose is to provide information on telehealth by assessing: (1) steps the hospital\/system are taking to reduce COVID-19 exposure for teams and patients; (2) new technologies allowing for the optimization of patient safety; and (3) use of telehealth for postoperative follow up. We will demonstrate that telehealth and its associated strategies can be used effectively to decrease COVID-19 exposure risks for both medical staff and patients during these rapidly changing and uncertain times.","105":"Transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair are the two most commonly used techniques in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, and the results of comparative studies are conflicting. The objective of this study is to compare the two methods in unilateral inguinal hernia repair. The data of consecutive patients who underwent TEP and TAPP due to unilateral inguinal hernia between December 7, 2017, and March 15, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. The primary outcome was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two techniques in terms of complications, conversion, pain, and operative time. The secondary outcome was recurrence rates. A total of 301 (TEP n=234, TAPP n=67) patients were included in the study. The mean age was 43 years, and the follow-up period was two years. The groups were similar in terms of demographic characteristics and hernia type. The mean operative time was longer in the TAPP group than in the TEP group (67 min and 58 min, p=0.007). The recurrence rate was 4.3% in the TEP group and 5.9% in the TAPP group (p&gt;0.05). The conversion rate was 6% in both groups. In total, 19 (6.3%) patients had intraoperative complications (TEP n=16, TAPP n=3), and 23 (7.6%) patients had postoperative complications (TEP n=16, TAPP n=7). Both intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were similar between the groups (p=0.31 and p=0.051, respectively). The early postoperative pain was less in the TEP group (p=0.004). Less early postoperative pain and shorter operative time were detected in patients who underwent TEP. ","106":"Robotic systems provide a platform for surgeons to expand their capabilities, allowing them to perform complex procedures safely and efficiently. Within the field of benign gynecology, this has become an increasingly popular option since receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2005. However, the appropriate indications for robotic versus laparoscopic surgery continue to be debated. Literature was reviewed to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based evaluation of the advantages and pitfalls of robotic surgery, the applications of robotic surgery for benign gynecologic procedures in comparison to conventional laparoscopy, and the role of robotic surgery as an educational tool. Robotic surgery has favorable outcomes for surgeons in the areas of ergonomics, dexterity, and fatigue. Cost comparisons are widely varied and elaborate. Most patient outcomes are comparable between robotic and laparoscopic hysterectomies and endometriosis resections. In patients with a body mass index &gt;30mg\/m2 and uteri &gt;750mg, hysterectomy outcomes are improved when surgery is done robotically. The use of the robotic system may be beneficial for patients undergoing myomectomy. Robotic surgery confers advantages for trainees and novice surgeons. There is no consensus on a standardized curriculum for robotic training or credentialing process for experienced surgeons. Robotic surgery has distinct features that make it a valuable tool for gynecologic surgeons. There are no clear indications regarding when a robotic route should be chosen but could be considered when above average complexity is anticipated and when training new surgeons.

Since the first angiograms and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were carried out, this progress has been tremendous and has led to a substantial decline in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this article is to report and review the latest developments and evidence in robotics-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention (rPCI) and its potential future applications, opportunities, and limitations. Contemporary evidence shows that rPCI can lead to a significant reduction in radiation exposure as well as medical hazards for cardiologists. Rates of device and procedural success remain high and there is no evidence of a disadvantage for the patient. The accuracy of implantation with a reduced geographic mismatch is a further advantage that can result in a higher quality of treatment. Even in complex coronary lesions and procedures, rPCI seems to be safe and efficient. The latest developments include telestenting over hundreds of kilometers from a remote platform. Currently, the main limitations are the absence of large-scale randomized trials for the valid assessment of the benefits and disadvantages of rPCI as well as the technical limitations of the currently available rPCI systems. rPCI is a forward-looking innovation in cardiology that is applicable to a wide range of coronary interventions. Despite the present lack of knowledge and the limited data concerning the outcome for the patient, the available literature reveals promising results that should lead to improvements for physicians and patients.","109":"Oncologic visceral surgery has recently been revolutionized by robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), sparing of functionally important structures and innovative intraoperative imaging tools. These techniques enable new dimensions of precision surgery and oncology. Currently, data-driven, cognitive operating rooms are standing at the forefront of the latest technical and didactic developments in abdominal surgery. Rectal low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision (TME) for lower- and middle-third rectal cancer is a challenging operation due to the narrow pelvis and the tender guiding structures. Thus, new approaches have been needed to simplify the procedure and to upgrade the results. The combination of robotics with pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring (pIONM) and new possibilities of visualization, such as multi- and hyperspectral imaging (MSI \/ HSI) or fluorescence imaging (FI) with indocyanine green (ICG) is a forward-looking modality to enhance surgical precision and reduce postoperative complications while improving oncologic and functional outcomes with a better quality of life.

Although many researchers have attempted to elucidate the optimal strategies for managing this disease, the lack of large-scale randomized control trials and the lack of agreement on disease staging have curtailed the development of clear-cut guidelines. The Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) group sought to address three questions for the management of patients who have ONFH: 1) What imaging studies are most sensitive and specific for the diagnostic evaluation of patients who have ONFH?; 2) What is the best treatment strategy for preventing disease progression in patients who have pre-collapse lesions?; and 3) What is the best treatment strategy for patients who have post-collapse disease? The Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) format was used to formulate the search strategy for each research question. A systematic review will be performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. ARCO participants have been allocated to three groups, each representing one of the PICO questions. After qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data extracted from studies pertaining to each of the three research questions, a set of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines will be proposed for the management of patients who have ONFH. It is not always clear which treatment method is optimal for the management of ONFH. Thus, many surgeons have developed and performed various procedures based on patient-specific factors. As there is no consensus on the optimal treatment for various stages of disease, it was clear that developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines would provide more structure and uniformity to management of these patients. Therefore, the results of this systematic review will lead to the development guidelines that may improve patient-care strategies and result in better outcomes for patients who have ONFH.

Eligible patients were those who underwent TJR (knee, hip, or shoulder) at any time during any of three tanezumab randomized phase 3 OA studies. Consenting patients were followed for 24 weeks post-surgery. Patients undergoing sub-total arthroplasty procedures were not eligible; there were no further protocol-defined exclusion criteria. Outcomes assessed in relation to joint adjudication outcome and prior tanezumab treatment included: 1) surgeon's assessment of procedural difficulty (uneventful, minor complications, major complications) at the time of the TJR; 2) postsurgical complications (clinically significant events attributable to the TJR, derived from adverse events) up to week 24; and 3) additional\/corrective procedures (procedures or investigations related to the TJR) up to week 24. The 150 patients had received placebo (n=20), tanezumab 2.5mg (n=52), tanezumab 2.5mg titrated to 5mg (tanezumab 2.5\/5mg, n=8), tanezumab 5mg (n=53), or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (n=17) in the parent studies. The 150 patients were adjudicated to have primary osteonecrosis (n=1), rapidly progressive OA (RPOA) type 2 (n=8), RPOA type 1 (n=3), other joint outcome (n=6), normal progression of OA (NPOA) (n=130), or insufficient information to determine RPOA versus NPOA (n=2). Surgeon's assessment of procedural difficulty was uneventful for 95.1% (116\/122) of patients. Through the 24-week study, there were no postsurgical complications for 96.0% (144\/150) of patients; the 6 patients who had complications were all adjudicated as NPOA (tanezumab 2.5mg, n=2; tanezumab 5mg, n=4). There were no additional\/corrective procedures for 93.3% (140\/150) of patients. Procedural difficulty of minor complications during surgery, postsurgical complications, and additional\/corrective procedures were infrequent, although more common with tanezumab 5mg, typically occurring in patients adjudicated as NPOA.

","114":"Wound care is a multidisciplinary field with significant economic burden to our healthcare system. Not only does wound care cost the US healthcare system $20 billion annually, but wounds also remarkably impact the quality of life of patients; wounds pose significant risk of mortality, as the five-year mortality rate for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and ischemic ulcers is notably higher compared to commonly encountered cancers such as breast and prostate. Although it is important to measure how wounds may or may not be improving over time, the only relative \"marker\" for this is wound area measurement-area measurements can help providers determine if a wound is on a healing or non-healing trajectory. Because wound area measurements are currently the only readily available \"gold standard\" for predicting healing outcomes, there is a pressing need to understand how other relative biomarkers may play a role in wound healing. Currently, wound care centers across the nation employ various techniques to obtain wound area measurements; length and width of a wound can be measured with a ruler, but this carries a high amount of inter- and intrapersonal error as well as uncertainty. Acetate tracings could be used to limit the amount of error but do not account for depth, thereby making them inaccurate. Here, we discuss current imaging modalities and how they can serve to accurately measure wound size and serve as useful adjuncts in wound assessment. Moreover, new imaging modalities are also discussed and how up-and-coming technologies can provide important information on \"biomarkers\" for wound healing.","115":"Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a major driver for increased costs following lower extremity joint arthroplasty procedures. It has been estimated that these account for over $2 billion in annual costs in the United States. While many of the current strategies for the prevention and treatment of SSIs target planktonic bacteria, 80 to 90% of bacterial pathogens exist in a sessile state. These sessile bacteria can produce extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) as protective barriers from host immune defenses and antimicrobial agents and thus, can be exceedingly difficult to eradicate. A novel wound care gel that disrupts the EPS and destroys the inciting pathogens has been developed for the treatment and prevention of biofilm-related infections. This is achieved by the simultaneous action of four key ingredients: (1) citric acid; (2) sodium citrate; (3) benzalkonium chloride; and (4) polyethylene glycol. Together, these constituents create a high osmolarity, pH-controlled environment that deconstructs and prevents biofilm formation, while destroying pathogens and promoting a moist environment for optimal wound healing. The available clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of this technology has been summarized, as well as the economic implications of its implementation and the authors' preferred method of its use. Due to the multifaceted burden associated with biofilm-producing bacteria in arthroplasty patients, this technology may prove to be beneficial for patients who have higher risks for infection, or perhaps, as a prophylactic measure to prevent infections for all patients.","116":null,"117":"Longevity and success of total hip arthroplasty (THA) is largely dependent on component positioning. While use of robotic platforms can improve this positioning, published evidence on its clinical benefits is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcomes of THA with robotic surgical assistance. We conducted an analysis of robotic arm-assisted primary THAs performed by a single surgeon utilizing a posterior approach. A total of 99 patients (107 cases) who had a minimum two-year follow up were identified. Their mean age was 61 years (range, 33 to 84 years), and their mean body mass index was 30.5 kg\/m2 (range, 18.5 to 49.1 kg\/m2). There were 56% female patients and primary osteoarthritis was the principal hip diagnosis in 88.8%. Operative times, lengths of hospital stay, and discharge dispositions were recorded, along with any complications. Modified Harris Hip Scores (HHS) were calculated to quantify clinical outcomes. Mean postoperative increases in HHS at 2- to 5.7-year follow up was 33 points (range, 6 to 77 points). There were no complications attributable to the use of robotic assistance. Surgical-site complications were rare; one case underwent a revision for prosthetic joint infection (0.93%) but there were no dislocations, periprosthetic fractures, or cases of mechanical implant loosening. There was no evidence of progressive radiolucencies or radiographic failure. Robotic arm-assisted THA resulted in low complication rates at minimum two-year follow up, with clinical outcomes comparable to those reported with manual surgery.1-4 The haptically-guided acetabular bone preparation enabled reliable cementless acetabular fixation and there were no adverse events related to the use of the robot. Dislocations were avoided in this case series. Randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to compare manual to robotic surgery and to investigate whether the precision found with this functional planning will reliably reduce the incidence of dislocations. ","118":"Although the endovascular approach is the therapeutic option of choice for thoracic and abdominal aortic diseases, open surgery is still the treatment of choice for aortic arch diseases. While open surgical repair remains the gold standard treatment for complete aortic arch replacement, it continues to be burdened by high mortality and neurologic complications, especially for patients who require redo surgery. Therefore, in the era of endovascular surgery, it is not surprising that hybrid operating rooms, new technologies, and new approaches are strongly challenging open surgery. Less-invasive endovascular procedures, when used to treat aortic arch diseases, when feasible and indicated, have clear advantages over open surgery, primarily because there is no need for cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermic circulatory arrest, or cerebral protection. Moreover, patients who have already been treated for acute type A aortic dissection continue to have a considerable risk for future aortic reintervention, which is associated with increased risk for short- and long-term mortality. In light of these advantages, it is clear how selected high-risk patients with aortic arch disease could benefit from the endovascular approach. However, the hemodynamic and anatomic characteristics of the aortic arch make the endovascular approach in this region challenging. In fact, uncorrected stent-graft placement can have fatal consequences for the patient and increase the risk of endoleaks and stroke. To minimize these potential risks, precise and accurate preoperative planning to achieve optimal stent-graft dimensions and implantation is essential together with careful patient selection. Endovascular options for the treatment of aortic arch disease include both hybrid procedures and total endovascular solutions. This manuscript provides an overview of the current strategies for endovascular aortic arch treatment, including the most recent available series on this topic. In addition, a literature search offers insight into the current state of the art.","119":"Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) electrodes are used to treat intractable painful conditions involving peripheral nerves. Methods for performing PNS continue to evolve, from open surgical to minimally invasive placement of electrodes. A PNS system consisting of subcutaneously implanted leads with an integrated anchor and electrodes, and an external pulse generator to produce peripheral neuromodulation, is now available for use in the clinical setting. This novel system allows either surgical or percutaneous lead positioning, and avoids the use of long leads or extensions crossing the joints, which are exposed to mechanical stress and damage. To identify methods for successfully inserting these electrodes, we investigated if a cadaver model could be an effective educational tool for teaching PNS electrode placement using ultrasound guidance. Six cadavers were studied in an attempt to find an ideal approach for ultrasound-guided electrode placement into the upper and lower extremities and cervical spine, and to describe the unique anatomy of the peripheral nerves relative to percutaneous stimulation-electrode placement. The use of cadaveric model simulations offers opportunities to practice percutaneous placement of PNS electrodes under stress-free conditions without patient discomfort, to acquire skill and confidence in performing these surgical approaches. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous placement of PNS electrodes should be learned in a simulation laboratory before such placement is performed in actual patients.","120":"The assessment of local blood flow patterns in patients with peripheral arterial disease is clinically relevant, since these patterns are related to atherosclerotic disease progression and loss of patency in stents placed in peripheral arteries, through mechanisms such as recirculating flow and low wall shear stress (WSS). However, imaging of vascular flow in these patients is technically challenging due to the often complex flow patterns that occur near atherosclerotic lesions. While several flow quantification techniques have been developed that could improve the outcomes of vascular interventions, accurate 2D or 3D blood flow quantification is not yet used in clinical practice. This article provides an overview of several important topics that concern the quantification of blood flow in patients with peripheral arterial disease. The hemodynamic mechanisms involved in the development of atherosclerosis and the current clinical practice in the diagnosis of this disease are discussed, showing the unmet need for improved and validated flow quantification techniques in daily clinical practice. This discussion is followed by a showcase of state-of-the-art blood flow quantification techniques and how these could be used before, during and after treatment of stenotic lesions to improve clinical outcomes. These techniques include novel ultrasound-based methods, Phase-Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PC-MRI) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The last section discusses future perspectives, with advanced (hybrid) imaging techniques and artificial intelligence, including the implementation of these techniques in clinical practice.","121":"Three-dimensional (3D) printing is emerging as an innovative tool for a tailored approach to endovascular or open procedures. The efforts of different specialists and data analysis can be used to fabricate patient-specific implants, which might have significant impact even in life-saving procedures such as aortic dissections or aortic arch aneurysm. 3D printing is gradually changing the traditional pattern of diagnosis and treatment. This innovative approach allows a perfect match between the patient's anatomy and the prosthetic graft, ideally resulting in better hemodynamics and improved long-term patency related to reduced turbulent flow. Future applications of 3D printing in the cardiovascular field combined with tissue engineering will enhance the therapeutic features of bioprinted tissues and scaffolds for regenerative medicine. This review will summarize the clinical significance of 3D printing in cardiovascular disease, exploring current applications, translational outlooks and future perspectives.","122":"Patients with symptomatic post-ischemic dilative myocardiopathy of the left ventricle require, in selected cases, an operation to reshape and reduce the volume of the left ventricular chamber, in addition to surgical myocardial revascularization and mitral valve repair, with the aim of prolonging survival, improving the quality of life and minimizing the need for re-hospitalizations related to recurrent heart failure. This procedure is called surgical ventricular restoration (SVR), and is a useful tool for the treatment of heart failure patients as an alternative to heart transplant. This article provides an overview of surgical ventricular restoration for the treatment of dilative ischemic myocardiopathy.

However, with the subsequent introduction of global endometrial ablation (GEA) devices and hysteroscopic morcellators (HMs), the CFGR has fallen into relative disuse-a regrettable situation since it remains ideally suited for accomplishing many procedures that are otherwise not achievable with these newer technologies. Procedures which involve greater precision and control-endomyometrial resection (EMR), hysteroscopic metroplasty, the correction of isthmoceles, the resection of intramural myomas, and the management of late-onset endometrial ablation failure-are only possible with the CFGR. In addition, the CFGR permits a variety of functions that would otherwise require several different disposable platforms. Despite the benefits of the gynecologic resectoscope, there are clear impediments to its use including a scarcity of educational resources and trained experts, medico-legal concerns, institutional obstacles to organizing an operative team, and the need to develop and maintain an adequate caseload. In Part I of this three-part series, the author will review why the CFGR remains a relevant and indispensable tool for the minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon, the composition of an operating room team, and the instrumentation and skills necessary to accomplish basic resectoscopic surgery. In Part II, we will describe how ultrasound guidance can be used to assist the execution of more challenging intermediate-level cases. Finally, in Part III, we will discuss the most demanding cases for the resectoscopic surgeon-the treatment of post-ablation failures and the removal of intramural leiomyomas-which are clinical scenarios that require ultrasound guidance and well-honed resectoscopic surgical skills.","124":null,"125":null,"126":null,"127":"Chronic postherniorrhaphy inguinal pain (CPIP) is common following inguinal hernia repair. As even primary minimally-invasive inguinal hernia repairs carry a risk of significant intra-operative bleeding, it is unsurprising that reoperative groin exploration and mesh explantation for chronic post-inguinal herniorrhaphy pain confers an even higher risk of arteriotomy or venotomy due to a distorted anatomy and the presence of adhesions. In this report, we present a single institution's experience with the management of intra-operative vascular injury encountered during minimally invasive groin exploration and mesh explantation for CPIP. We performed a retrospective consecutive case series study at a single academic center of patients with CPIP who underwent minimally invasive groin exploration and mesh removal during which an iatrogenic arteriotomy or venotomy occurred from September 2015 to September 2020. Descriptive statistics were collected for age, laterality of hernia repair, mean follow-up time, surgical approach (robotic vs. laparoscopic), type of intra-operative vascular injury, vascular control technique, and post-operative complications. Of 196 minimally invasive groin exploration and mesh removal cases, 46 were performed with robotic assistance and 150 were performed using traditional laparoscopy. The overall incidence of intra-operative vascular injury was 43 (22%). Fifteen of 46 (32%) robotic groin exploration and mesh removal cases and 28 of 150 (19%) laparoscopic cases involved vascular control. Three of 15 (20%) robotic cases and 23 of 28 (82%) laparoscopic cases involved a hybrid open inguinal approach to address anterior pathology (neurectomy, anterior mesh removal, hernia repair) or facilitate exposure for vascular repair. The most common site of injury was the inferior epigastric vessels. Other sites included the iliac vein, iliac artery, corona mortis, and accessory obturator vessels. Vascular control techniques included ligation with an energy device or suture, primary suture repair of injured vessel, or bovine pericardium patch angioplasty. All were managed without intra-operative vascular surgery intervention except for one case with extensive calcification that required endarterectomy and angioplasty to improve patency. No cases required conversion to midline laparotomy. Ninety three percent of the cases with large vessel bleeding during laparoscopic-assisted procedures were repaired via an open groin incision, whereas all cases of large vessel bleeding during robotic-assisted procedures were repaired robotically. None of the patients required transfusion. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 patients (7%), 2 (5%) developed hematoma formation requiring surgical evacuation, and 1 (2%) developed ipsilateral iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and underwent peripheral angiography and thrombolysis. Although minimally invasive groin exploration and mesh explantation for CPIP is technically challenging, it is a safe and effective operation when performed at experienced centers. Iatrogenic vascular injury should be anticipated but can be effectively controlled laparoscopically, robotically, or via a hybrid open inguinal incision without conversion to a midline laparotomy and with low post-operative complication rates. ","128":"This prospective study aimed to assess the efficacy of a transdermal CO2 gel in promoting regeneration in the vulvovaginal area in postmenopausal women experiencing symptoms as part of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Transdermal carboxytherapy refers to the application of CO2 through the skin's superficial layer, which is intended to increase oxygenation (through the Bohr effect) and angiogenesis, thus helping to reduce symptoms of GSM. In this study, 20 women with moderate or severe signs or symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy were randomized to receive either transdermal CO2 therapy (n=10) or a placebo gel (ultrasound gel, n=10). The gels (transdermal CO2 gel or the placebo) were applied by the patients at home. The gels were applied in two treatment cycles (10 days of total treatment). Each cycle involved daily applications of the gel to the vulvovaginal area, from Monday to Friday, with no application on weekends. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging (DIVA) questionnaires were used to gather standardized information, and biopsy samples were obtained from the vagina and vulva for histological analysis, both on the first day of treatment and 10 days after the final application of gel. Patients who received the transdermal CO2 gel showed significant improvements on the FSFI and DIVA questionnaires and the biopsies revealed that the CO2 gel had a regenerative effect on vulvovaginal tissues.","129":null,"130":"","131":"Minimally invasive surgery has rapidly evolved from the once novel laparoscopic approach to advanced robotic surgery. In the past few decades alone, robotic systems have gone from systems which were significantly limited to full-fledged platforms featuring 3D vision, articulated instruments, integrated ultrasound and fluorescence capabilities, and even the latest wireless connectivity, as is now standard. In this review, we aimed to summarize features of currently commercialized and utilized robotic surgical systems as well as currently unfolding platforms. The pros and cons of different robotic surgical systems were discussed. In addition, we discussed the future perspectives of robotic platforms used in general surgery. In this regard, we emphasized that the market, once dominated by Intuitive Surgical Inc., has become occupied by several worthy competitors with new technological giants such as Google. Eventually, the question facing hospital systems will not be of whether or not to invest in robotic surgery, but instead of how they will strike balance between price, features, and availability when choosing robots from the growing market to best equip their surgeons.","132":"Adult Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare disease caused by the human papilloma virus in which papilloma grows from the respiratory epithelium. Patients can suffer from significant respiratory distress secondary to tracheal or bronchial obstruction by papilloma and the mainstay of treatment is bronchoscopic debridement. There are a variety of techniques to resect the endoluminal tumor, including CO2 or YAG laser, argon plasma coagulation, microdebrider and cold forceps. There have been documented cases of healthcare workers contracting HPV after exposure to surgical smoke during ablation of papilloma and measures should be taken to avoid inhalation of the smoke plume. For proximal lesions that are accessible to a microdebrider, this appears to be a safe and effective technique that does not generate heat or surgical smoke. The rate of recurrence of adult-onset respiratory papilloma after initial debulking varies and adjuvant medical therapy including intralesional cidofovir, interferon, or oral indole-3-carbinol has been used to slow recurrence. Malignant transformation of adult-onset RRP to squamous cell carcinoma has been reported to occur in 3-7% of cases. Therefore, ongoing surveillance is needed to monitor for disease progression and malignant transformation. Here we describe three patients whose tracheal disease was managed with an Nd-YAG laser and microdebrider. One patient was treated with adjuvant systemic indole-3 carbinol and another was maintained with serial debridement only. The third patient presented with obstructing squamous cell carcinoma of the trachea and was treated with definitive chemoradiation. She presented with a new left mainstem lesion 6 months later which was diagnosed as RRP. She was started on indole-3 carbinol, but unfortunately it transformed to squamous cell carcinoma 8 months later.","133":"To clarify the advantages of negative pressure therapy (NPT) compared to other methods of temporary abdominal closure (TAC) in the management of secondary peritonitis. We retraced the history of known methods of TAC, and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages. We evaluated as the NPT mechanisms, both from the macroscopic that bio-molecular point of view, well suits to manage this difficult condition. The ideal TAC technique should be quick to apply, easy to change, protect and contain the abdominal viscera, decrease bowel edema, prevent loss of domain and abdominal compartment syndrome, limit contamination, allow egress of peritoneal fluid (and its estimation) and not result in adhesions. It should also be cost-effective, minimize the number of dressing changes and the number of surgical revisions, and ensure a high rate of early closure with a low rate of complications (especially entero-atmospheric fistula). For NPT, the reported fistula rate is 7%, primary fascial closure ranges from 33 to 100% (average 60%) and the mortality rate is about 20%. With the use of NPT as TAC, it may be possible to extend the window of time to achieve primary fascial closure (for up to 20-40 days). NPT has several potential advantages in open-abdomen (OA) management of secondary peritonitis and may make it possible to achieve all the goals suggested above for an ideal TAC system. Only trained staff should use NPT, following the manufacturer's instructions when commercial products are used. Even if there was a significant evolution in OA management, we believe that further research into the role of NPT for secondary peritonitis is necessary.

While there is no replacement for live operative experience, training outside the operating room offers structured educational opportunities and stress modulation. A stepwise program for acquiring new technical skills required in robotic surgery involves three modules: ergonomic, psychomotor, and procedural. This is a prospective, educational research protocol aiming at evaluating the responsiveness of general surgery residents in Robotic-Assisted Surgery Training (RAST). Responsiveness is defined as change in performance over time. Performance is measured by the following content-valid metrics for each module. Module 1 proficiency in ergonomics includes: cart deploy, boom control, cart driving, camera port docking, targeting anatomy, flex joint, clearance joint and port nozzle adjusting, and routine and emergent undocking. Module 2 proficiency in psychomotor skills includes tissue handling, accuracy error, knot quality, and operating time. Module 3 proficiency in procedural skills prevents deviations from standardized sequential procedural steps in order to test length of specimen resection, angle for transection, vessel stump length post ligation, distance of anastomosis from critical landmarks, and proximal and distal resection margins. Resident responsiveness over time will be assessed comparing the results of baseline testing with final testing. Educational interventions will include viewing one instructional video prior to module commencement, response to module-specific multiple-choice questions, and individual weekly training sessions with a robotic instructor in the operating room. Residents will progress through modules upon successful final testing and will evaluate the educational environment with the Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure (DREEM) inventory. The RAST program protocol outlined herein is an educational challenge with the primary endpoint to provide evidence that formal instruction has an impact on proficiency and safety in executing robotic skills.","136":"In complex primary and revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA), rotating-hinge TKA (RH-TKA) prostheses play an important role. Compared to early fixed-hinge knee designs, new implants that include rotating platforms and improved hinge constructs may offer improvements in both survival and clinical outcomes. We sought to evaluate early survival following complex primary and revision TKA with a rotating-hinge knee prosthesis. We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of patients (n=47, 48 knees) who underwent revision TKA using an RH-TKA system. The mean age was 73 years (range, 37 - 86). The mean body mass index was 29 (range, 16.3 - 45.9) and the median ASA score was 3 (IQR, 2 - 3). As mortality was high, we performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis to evaluate survival, with death as failure. The median follow-up was 2.5 years (range, 0.07 - 9.8). Revision-free survival was 97% at a median 2.5 years of follow-up. Overall mortality was 46% (17\/37) and survival free from death was 69% (49% - 82%) at a median of 2.5 years. Most reoperations were due to infection (5\/12), following by wound-related complications (2\/12) and hematomas (2\/12). A high postoperative complication rate and mortality are evident in TKA using a hinged knee prosthesis in complex revision TKA. If the indication and surgical technique are matched to the complexity of the case, this type of implant offers a feasible salvage procedure.","137":"Complex abdominal wall reconstruction (CAWR) in patients with large abdominal defects have become a common procedure. The aim of this study was to identify independent predictors of surgical site infections (SSI) in patients undergoing CAWR. This was an ambidirectional cohort study of 240 patients who underwent CAWR with biologic mesh between 2012 and 2020 at an academic tertiary\/quaternary care center. Prior superficial SSI, deep SSI, organ space infections, enterocutaneous fistulae, and combined abdominal infections were defined as prior abdominal infections. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to determine independent risk factors for SSI. There were a total of 39 wound infections, with an infection rate of 16.3%. Forty percent of patients who underwent CAWR in this study had a history of prior abdominal infections. In the multivariable regression models not weighted for length of stay (LOS), prior abdominal infection (odds ratio [OR]: 2.49, p=0.013) and higher body mass index (BMI) (OR: 1.05, p=0.023) were independent predictors of SSI. In the multivariable regression model weighted for LOS, prior abdominal infection (OR: 2.2, p=0.034), higher BMI (OR: 1.05, p=0.024), and LOS (OR: 1.04, p=0.043) were independent predictors of SSI. The history of prior abdominal infections, higher BMI, and increased LOS are important independent predictor of SSI following CAWR.

We will be focusing on lower extremity wounds associated with venous and\/or lymphatic disease, the combination often referred to as \"lymphophlebitic\" disease, and the treatment effect of IPC on this disease process and its sequelae. The function and purpose of pneumatic compression is closely examined along with a variety of pneumatic compression devices that currently exist in the market. A thorough review of the literature was conducted to evaluate the utility of intermittent pneumatic compression in the treatment of lower extremity venous stasis ulcers. Additionally, the author describes personal experience with the use of pneumatic compression on 10 patients with venous stasis ulcers at a single center. There is significant data supporting the use of IPC in patients with lymphophlebitic disease. Overall, ideal patient selection may be crucial. Previous data has shown that patients with high body mass index (&gt;33 kg\/m2) and poor functional status (walking less than 200m a day) are related to poor ulcer healing. Therefore, a study that looks primarily at this group (as our small quality assurance [QA] project did) may show increased benefit in this population. It is clear that IPC is of benefit to some patient cohorts with lymphophlebitic disease. This advanced therapy would help patients who have failure of their calf muscle pump and an inability to improve it through other means. However, it is only part of an algorithm that includes: direct wound bed management, moisture control, possible primary venous disease intervention, physical therapy, weight loss, and improved nutrition.","142":"This report presents the authors' experience with surgical wound-healing using a negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) device in a population of oncological orthopedic patients. Two groups of 26 oncological patients each underwent surgical excision. After surgery, the control group received standard dressings and the closed incisional NPWT (ciNPWT) group was treated with a ciNPWT system on the sutured wound area for 14 days. As a primary endpoint, the percentage of post-surgery wound-site complications using ciNPWT devices was compared to that with standard patch dressings. Overall, 30.7% of the control group and 7.7% of the ciNPWT group manifested wound-site complications within 2 weeks after surgery. As a secondary endpoint, final wound healing was compared between the groups: delayed wound healing was observed in 4 (15.4%) patients in the control group and in none (0%) of those in the ciNPWT group. Finally, the length of stay (LOS) was 6.3 days in the control group and 5.1 days in the ciNPWT group. These results suggest that the ciNPWT device could be beneficial in minimizing the incidence of short-term surgical-site complications and decreasing length of stay in high-risk patients, such as those undergoing oncological orthopedic surgery.","143":null,"144":"Autologous keratinocyte culture, and combinations of scaffolds, different cell types, solutions of macromolecules, or growth factors have contributed to the resurfacing of full-thickness skin defects.

We included patients with a demonstrated predominant ischemia related to the LAD territory. Of 70 patients who were operated upon at the Benetti Foundation, 10 received hybrid revascularization. The patient is prepared as for a standard coronary bypass operation through sternotomy. The sternum is opened to the 3rd or 4th intercostal space depending on the anatomy, and a retractor is put in place. The left mammary artery is generally dissected to about 8 cm and isolated without the veins. Importantly, the angle of the superior part, where the mammary artery is attached to the sternum, needs to be below 20% to avoid any potential kinking. The pericardium is cleaned to identify the area of the pulmonary artery. The pericardium is opened to the apex and towards the right to around 5 to 6 cm initially. In most cases, the area of the LAD can be seen and the potential area of the anastomosis is defined. The patient is heparinized and the LAD is occluded with 5-0 Proline. A mechanical stabilizer is put in place and the anastomosis is performed. When the bypass is finished, and before sutures are tied, the stitches of 5-0 polypropylene around the artery are released, along with the clamp of the mammary artery; the anastomosis is then tied. The mechanical stabilizer is removed, the stitches of the pericardium are released and the flow of the graft is measured, while ensuring that there is no kinking. If the flow and Pulsatility and Resistance (PR) are acceptable, the mammary is fixed with 2 stitches of 7-0 polypropylene on both sides around 1 cm from the anastomosis. The heparin is reverted with protamine and a drain is put in place, while taking care to avoid any chance of touching the mammary artery or the anastomosis. The sternum is closed with 1 or 2 wires. Operative mortality in this series was 0%; one patient was converted to sternotomy off-pump (1.4%). None of the grafts were revised after measurement with a Medistim system (Medistim ASA, Oslo, Norway). Fifty five patients (79%) were extubated in the operating room The average hospitalization stay was 60 hours (SD 17, 95% CI). Sixteen patients who underwent the LIMA-to-LAD procedure were restudied, with 100% patency. At 144 months, 82% of the patients were alive and 68% were asymptomatic.

It is important how increases in patient complexity impact a variety of patient outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to determine if a higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI), a measure of patient complexity, is correlated with: 1) longer hospital length of stay; 2) increased 90-day medical complications; 3) higher 90-day readmissions; and 4) greater two-year implant-related complications following primary THA. Patients undergoing primary THA from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2015 were queried from the Medicare Standard Analytical Files using the International Classification of Disease, ninth revision (ICD-9) procedure code 81.51. The queried patients (387,831) were filtered by ECI scores of 1 to 5. Patients who have ECI scores of 2 to 5 represented the study cohorts and were matched according to age and sex to patients who have the lowest ECI score (ECI of 1). All cohorts were longitudinally followed to assess and compare hospital length of stay, 90-day medical complications, 90-day readmissions, and two-year implant-related complications. We compared odds-ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and p-values using logistic regression analyses and Welch's t-tests. Patients who have ECI scores greater than 1 had higher hospital length of stay (p&lt;0.001), 90-day medical complications (p&lt;0.001), 90-day readmissions (p&lt;0.001), and two-year implant-related complications (p&lt;0.001). Patients who have an ECI score of 2 (1.26, 95% CI: 1.20-1.32), ECI of 3 (1.61, 95% CI: 1.53-1.69), ECI of 4 (2.05, 95% CI: 1.95-2.14), and ECI of 5 (2.32, 95% CI: 2.21-2.43) had an increasing trend for readmissions, with higher ECI scores correlating with greater odds of readmission following primary THA. Two-year implant-related complications also showed a similar increasing trend with greater patient complexity. Patients who had an ECI score of 5 (2.54, 95% CI: 2.39-2.69) had more implant-related complications compared to patients who had an ECI score of 2 (1.39, 95% CI:1.31-1.48). The results of this study illustrate that a higher Elixhauser-Comorbidity Index is an independent risk factor for longer hospital length of stay, higher 90-day medical complications, greater 90-day readmissions, and increased two-year implant-related complications following primary THA. This study is important as it further defines and heightens awareness of adverse events for complex patients undergoing this procedure. Future studies can examine if these events can potentially be mitigated through reductions in ECI scores prior to surgery and increased incentives for the healthcare team. ","148":"The goal of this study was to evaluate the recurrence rate of instability following arthroscopic Bankart repairs in regard to the number and types of fixation utilized. A Bankart lesion is a tear in the anteroinferior capsulolabral complex within the shoulder, occurring in association with an anterior shoulder dislocation. These injuries can result in glenoid bone loss, decreased range of motion, and recurrent shoulder instability. Successful repair of these lesions has been reported in the literature with repair constructs that have three points of fixation. However, the definition of \"one point of fixation\" is yet to be fully elucidated. A consecutive series of arthroscopically repaired Bankart lesions were evaluated pertaining to the points of fixation required to achieve shoulder stability. This included the number, position, and types of anchors used. Patients consented to complete a series of surveys at a minimum of two years postoperatively. The primary outcome was to determine recurrent instability via the UCLA Shoulder Score, the ROWE Shoulder Instability Score, and the Oxford Shoulder Score. A secondary outcome included pain on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). There were 116 patients reviewed, 46 patients achieved three points of fixation in their surgical repair via two anchors and 70 patients achieved a similar fixation with three or more anchors. There was no significant difference in the mean age, gender, or body mass index (BMI). Patients receiving two anchors demonstrated recurrent instability 8.7% of the time (4 of 46 patients). Patients who received three or more anchors demonstrated recurrent instability 8.6% of the time (6 of 70 patients). Overall, there was no statistical significance between the number\/types of anchors used. Between the two cohorts, there was no statistically significant difference found between VAS, ROWE, UCLA, and Oxford Scores. There was a significant difference in pain reported on the VAS scale with an average VAS score of 0.43 versus 2.5 in those without and with recurrent instability respectively. Contention still exists surrounding the exact definition of \"a point of fixation\" in arthroscopic Bankart repairs.

We reviewed 266 primary THAs (254 patients) performed in our institution between December 2016 and December 2018 using a new highly porous titanium acetabulum shell fabricated via additive manufacturing. Clinical and functional outcomes were measured using SF\/VR-12 and HOOS JR to determine patient satisfaction with surgery. Radiographs were assessed to determine the presence of migration, radiolucency, and loosening. Patients records were reviewed to assess cup survivorship in terms of all-cause revisions and revision for aseptic cup loosening. At a minimum of two-year follow up (range: 2-3.45 years), the patient cohort demonstrated significant improvement in postoperative functional scores (hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score for joint replacement [HOOS JR.] and clinical scores (12-item short-form health survey [SF\/VR-12]) (p&lt;0.001). One cup developed progressive radiolucent lines at the prosthesis-bone interface consistent with loosening and was revised. The overall acetabular component two-year survivorship free of all-cause failure was 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 95.5-99.4%). When aseptic loosening of the acetabular component was used as the failure endpoint, the two-years survivorship rate was 99.6% (95% CI: 98.9-100%). Highly porous titanium cementless acetabular cups produced via additive-manufacturing showed promising early clinical and radiological results in primary THA with low rates of aseptic loosening.

The optimal ICG dose is unknown, but the most commonly cited dose in the literature is 2.5 mg. We describe our experience using micro-dosing of ICG as proof-of-concept for its successful use in the identification of biliary structures. A video library from a variety of hepatobiliary surgeries which included micro-dosing of ICG was compiled between 2018 and 2020. These videos were retrospectively reviewed and graded for the degree of visualization of biliary structures (complete, partial, none) and the degree of background liver fluorescence (significant, moderate, minimal). Overall, 40 videos were reviewed; 70% were minimally invasive cholecystectomies. Micro-dosing was used in all patients; complete visualization was achieved in 52.5% of the patients, partial visualization in 40%, and no visualization in 7.6%. Eighty percent of patients had minimal to moderate background fluorescence. Despite ICG micro-dosing, 20% of the patients still had significant liver dye uptake. ICG cholangiography is an alternative to more invasive means of intraoperative imaging during biliary surgery, but the optimal dose of ICG is unknown.

PECFD becomes even more challenging in patients who have prominent shoulders and\/or short necks with C6-7-disc herniation, because of the difficulty to localize C6-7 vertebral structure under fluoroscopy. The study objective is to prove that the PECFD can be performed safely and successfully to C6-7-disc herniation on patients with prominent shoulders and\/or short necks following our novel surgical techniques under fluoroscopic guidance. PECFD was performed on a patient who had an extruded foraminal disc herniation at C6-7 on the left with left arm pain and weakness. Due to his prominent shoulders and a short neck, the C6-7 anatomic site was not visible under traditional anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral fluoroscopic views. The authors inserted a reference needle to C4-5 facets between C4 and C5 pedicles under AP and lateral fluoroscopic views. Following the reference needle, the C6-7 facets were easily located with an oblique fluoroscopic view. A large endoscopic cannula was used initially for adequate resection of C6-7 facets, followed by a small cannula for nerve root handling with minimal pressure and discectomy. The novel surgical techniques resulted in a complete resection of the C6-7-disc herniation and resolution of the patient's radiculopathy with no postoperative complications.

","153":"Muscle and nerve tissue damage can elicit a significant loss of function and poses as a burden for patients and healthcare providers. Even for tissues, such as the peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle, that harbor significant regenerative capacity, innate regenerative processes often lead to less than optimal recovery and residual loss of function. The reasons for poor regeneration include significant cell damage secondary to oxidative stress, poor recruitment of resident stem cells, and an unfavorable microenvironment for tissue regeneration. Stem cell-based therapy was once thought as a potential therapy in tissue regeneration, due to its self-renewal and multipotent capabilities. Early advocates for cellular-based therapy pointed to the pluripotent nature of stem cells, thus eluding to its ability to differentiate into resident cells as the source of its regenerative capability. However, increasing evidence has revealed a lack of engraftment and differentiation of stem cells, thereby pointing to stem cell paracrine activity as being responsible for its regenerative potential. Stem cell-conditioned media houses biomolecular factors that portray significant regenerative potential. Amniotic-derived stem cell-conditioned media (AFS-CM) has been of particular interest because of its ease of allocation and in vitro culture. The purpose of this review is to report the results of studies that assess the role of AFS-CM for nerve and muscle conditions.

Significant patient surges have caused severe resource allocation challenges in personal protective equipment, medications, and staffing. The virus produces bilateral lung infiltrates causing significant oxygen depletion and respiratory failure thus increasing the need for ventilators. The patients who require ventilation are often requiring prolonged ventilation and depleting hospital resources. Tracheostomy is often utilized in patients requiring prolonged ventilation, and early tracheostomy in critical care patients has been shown in some studies to improve a variety of factors including intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilation weaning, and decreased sedation medication utilization. In a patient surge setting, as long as adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) is available to minimize spread to healthcare workers, early tracheostomy may be a beneficial management of these patients. Decreasing sedative medication utilization may help prevent shortages in future waves of infection and improve patient-provider communication as patients are more alert. Tracheostomy care is easier than endotracheal intubation and may have decreased viral aerosolization risk, particularly if repeat intubation is necessary after a weaning trial. Additionally, tracheostomy patients can be monitored with less staff, decreasing total healthcare worker exposure to infection. To manage risk of exposure, coordination of ventilation controlled by an anesthesiologist or a critical care physician with a surgeon during the procedure can minimize aerosolization to the team. Risk management and resource allocation is of the utmost importance in any global crisis and procedures must be appropriately planned and benefits to patients, as well as minimized exposure to healthcare providers, must be considered. Early tracheostomy could be a beneficial procedure for severe SARS-CoV-2 patients to minimize long-term virus aerosolization and exposure for healthcare workers while decreasing sedation, allowing for earlier transfer out of the ICU, and improving hospital resource utilization.","162":"Open mesh repair is one of the most frequently performed general surgery operations worldwide. Unfortunately, the classic technique using stitches to fix the mesh is still associated with a high risk of chronic pain. We propose a new technique that uses autologous Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) to fix the mesh. PRF is prepared in theatre by centrifugation of the patient's own blood and immediately applied to fix the mesh. In this feasibility pilot study, five patients were operated upon with the PRF-mesh repair technique. Postoperative pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) up to 6 months after surgery. Time to recovery was also recorded for all patients. VAS in this small group of patients was grossly compared with that in a historical cohort of patients who underwent Lichtenstein repair; due to the small sample size, no statistical comparison was performed. Postoperative pain remained at low levels and no patient experienced chronic pain, recurrence or any other complication within 6 months. All patients returned to their usual activities within 3 days after surgery. The VAS scores confirmed that PRF-mesh repair may be associated with less pain than the Lichtenstein technique. PRF-mesh repair is a safe and effective option in the treatment of inguinal hernias as it couples the safety of physiologically enhanced healing with the efficacy of prompt fixation of the mesh. ","163":"Implantable left ventricular assist devices (durable LVADs) have dramatically improved mortality and morbidity in patients with advanced heart failure. Originally designed as a bridge or candidacy to heart transplantation, the indications extend toward permanent support and palliation. Modern durable continuous flow LVADs are small, commercially available, and allow for different surgical approaches to a wide range of patients with various cardiac pathologies. We will review different surgical implantation techniques of modern continuous flow LVADs, as well as specific aspects of preoperative patient evaluation and planning.","164":null,"165":"The direct superior approach to total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a recently developed technique aimed at sparing the iliotibial band, obturator externus tendon, and quadratus femoris muscle while working within the familiar anatomical landscape of the posterior approach. While the direct superior approach has been used for more than a decade, there is a lack of midterm outcomes and safety data. This study elaborates on promising short-term results and aims to investigate the midterm outcomes of the direct superior approach. We present a unicentric, retrospective case-controlled analysis of a minimum two-year follow up of the direct superior approach in comparison to those of the more conventional and established mini-posterior approach. The results indicate that patient recovery, as measured by Harris Hip Score and timed-up-and-go at three months and two years, are virtually identical. There was no difference in gait aid utilization or frequency of narcotic use. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in length of stay by over one day associated with the direct superior approach (p=0.003). There was no compromise in acetabular component position or observed lucencies over time. Overall, the direct superior approach appears to be safe and warrants longer-term study to evaluate its effect on hospital-related cost, same-day discharge, and hip stability. ","166":"AI (Artificial intelligence) is an interdisciplinary field aimed at the development of algorithms to endow machines with the capability of executing cognitive tasks. The number of publications regarding AI and surgery has increased dramatically over the last two decades. This phenomenon can partly be explained by the exponential growth in computing power available to the largest AI training runs. AI can be classified into different sub-domains with extensive potential clinical applications in the surgical setting. AI will increasingly become a major component of clinical practice in surgery. The aim of the present Narrative Review is to give a general introduction and summarized overview of AI, as well as to present additional remarks on potential surgical applications and future perspectives in surgery.","167":"In western countries, approximately 1 % of individuals are affected by chronic wounds during their lifetime. Due to changing demographics, this incidence will likely increase in the future. Additionally, the high prevalence is accompanied by substantial treatment expenditures. Therefore, it is of global interest to find effective treatment algorithms. In this article, we present up-to-date solutions for treating chronic \/ difficult to heal and complex wounds by means of plastic and reconstructive surgery. We outline the principles of chronic wounds and how to perform an appropriate diagnosis. Close cooperation and interdisciplinary exchange are important for optimizing treatment. We report the principles of wound debridement and the role of negative pressure wound therapy. Moreover, we discuss the state of the art of defect reconstruction by means of skin grafting, with or without acellular dermal matrices, local tissue transfers and free tissue transfers. In very complex cases, the local macrovascular blood flow is greatly reduced and there are few, if any, recipient vessels for free flap reconstruction. We discuss the role of arteriovenous loops to overcome this problem.","168":null,"169":"In the quest for increased surgical precision and improved joint kinematics, Computer-Assisted Orthopedic Surgery (CAOS) shows promising results for both total and partial joint replacement. In the knee, computer-assisted joint design can now be applied to the treatment of younger patients suffering pain and restriction of activity due to focal defects in their femoral articular cartilage. By taking MRI scans of the affected knee and digitally segmenting these scans, we can identify and map focal defects in cartilage and bone. Metallic implants matched to the defect can be fabricated, and guide instrumentation to ensure proper implant alignment and depth of recession in the surrounding cartilage can be designed from segmented MRI scans. Beginning in 2012, a series of 682 patient-specific implants were designed based on MRI analysis of femoral cartilage focal defects, and implanted in 612 knees. A Kaplan-Meier analysis found a cumulative survivorship of 96% at 7-year follow-up from the first implantation. Fourteen (2.3%) of these implants required revision due to disease progression, incorrect implant positioning, and inadequate lesion coverage at the time of surgery. These survivorship data compare favorably with all other modes of treatment for femoral focal cartilage lesions and support the use of patient-specific implants designed from segmented MRI scans in these cases.","170":null,"171":"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most frequent congenital cardiac defect, and affects 0.5-2% of live births. Almost half of BAV subjects develop different degrees of valvular dysfunction during their lifetime. In both echocardiographic cohorts and surgical series, pure aortic regurgitation is significantly less common than stenosis. BAV also carries a higher risk of aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection or aortic valve endocarditis compared to the general population. Once aortic insufficiency reaches threshold criteria for surgical treatment, the valve has to be replaced (conventional aortic valve replacement, the outcomes of which are well established) or repaired. Repair techniques for regurgitant BAVs and valve-sparing surgery for BAV-related aneurysms have evolved remarkably over the past several decades. Improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms of normal and pathological BAV function and the development of criteria and techniques to address all the pathologic components of valve and root have supported better repair results. The more frequent stenotic BAV is treated by prosthetic valve replacement or, in recent years, by trans-catheter prosthetic replacement (TAVR), the application of which in the BAV setting is increasing, as with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) stenosis, especially since indications are extended to medium-risk patients. It has been reported that the risk of paravalvular leak and\/or prosthesis malposition is higher in BAV than in TAV stenosis, due to the more elliptical annulus and the calcified raphe of the bicuspid valve. New-generation balloon-expandable devices seem to be capable of lowering the rates of these complications. As research in this field keeps filling in the gaps in current knowledge about bicuspid malformation and its common complications, further advancements in their treatment are awaited.","172":"The goal of this study was to assess the bacteriology of surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients undergoing complex abdominal wall reconstruction (CAWR) with biologic mesh. This was a prospective cohort study of all patients who developed SSI following CAWR with biologic mesh between 2017-2020 at an academic tertiary\/quaternary care center. The patients were subdivided into six overlapping groups: infections found during hospitalization vs. infections found after discharge, sensitive bacteria vs. resistant bacteria, and nosocomial bacteria vs. intestinal bacteria. Of the 194 patients who underwent CAWR during the study period, 33 (17%) developed SSI. SSI was more commonly discovered after discharge than during hospitalization. These SSIs were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rather than sensitive bacteria, and required re-operation, which were more frequently found following elective procedures. VRE and MRSA infections were more common with clean wounds than with clean\/contaminated, contaminated, or dirty wounds, while SSIs with intestinal flora were more common following fistula and stoma takedown. Surgical site infections with resistant bacteria manifest more frequently post-discharge and require more re-admissions and re-operations. ","173":"Dual mobility constructs for THA have been a tremendous advancement for hip arthroplasty surgeons, especially in scenarios where instability is a possibility. While some researchers have reported events of malseating with their use, the authors of the current study believe that this may be avoided by ensuring appropriate surgical technique. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to: (1) describe the surgical techniques that we employ to ensure that the liner is adequately seated; and (2) report the rates of malseating, dislocation, and aseptic loosening among our collective cohort of dual mobility THA patients. All patients who underwent THA with a dual mobility construct between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018 at four institutions were identified. Those who had less than two years of follow up were excluded. Outcomes of interest included radiographic evidence of liner malseating, aseptic loosening, and dislocation. A total of 1,826 patients who underwent THA with a dual mobility construct were identified. Among these patients, 504 had less than two years of follow up and were excluded from our analysis. The remaining 1,322 patients met our criteria including 941 primary THAs (71.2%) and 381 revision THAs (28.8%). After a minimum follow-up period of two years, there were only two cases of malseated liners (0.15%). Serial follow ups have demonstrated no movement or changes in the position of the liners over time for both patients. In addition, they have been shown to have normal serum metal ion levels and no clinical complaints after 5.3- and 7.1-year follow up. Seven of 1,322 patients (0.53%) experienced a dislocation. Aseptic loosening of the acetabular cup was diagnosed in one patient 3.4 years postoperatively. In three patients, femoral component loosening occurred after a mean follow-up period of 2.3 years, (1.3 to 3.1 years). Among the 941 primary cases, the incidence of liner malseating was 0.21%, as both patients who experienced this complication were in this subgroup. As stated above, these patients have demonstrated normal serum metal ion levels and no clinical or radiographic sequelae as a result of the liner malseating. The dislocation rate among primary cases was 0.21% (2 of 941). Aseptic loosening of the acetabular component occurred in two (0.21%) while one patient (0.1%) was found to have femoral component loosening at final follow up. Of the 381 revision THAs, there were no cases of liner malseating. Five revision THA patients (1.3%) experienced a dislocation over our study period. Two revision THA patients experienced aseptic loosening of the femoral component (0.79%) at final follow up. The results of this paper demonstrate that malseating is not a prevalent issue with dual mobility THA when appropriate surgical techniques are used. It is hoped that that this paper clarifies the techniques for implantation of these implants and that excellent results can be achieved when care is taken to ensure that liners are well-seated intraoperatively. ","174":null,"175":"As bundle payments have begun focusing on orthopaedic procedures, particularly total knee arthroplasties (TKAs), surgeons and hospitals have evaluated methods for improving efficiency. Few studies have investigated the impact of novel, sealed-container and instrument-tray technology on turnover and costs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare traditional and sealed container-sterilized TKA surgical trays by: 1) investigating the setup and clean-down time in the operating room (OR); 2) examining trays processing time in central sterile supply (CS); and 3) estimating OR and CS costs and waste produced. An interdisciplinary team determined points throughout a TKA tray single-case life cycle that could cause variations in turnover time. The times were recorded for two different TKA tray configurations. Process A utilized instruments housed in vendor trays that were \"blue\" wrap sterilized, while Process B employed optimized trays that were sealed container-sterilized. Times were recorded during preoperative setup and postoperative clean down in the OR and CS. Reductions in mean OR or CS times were used to estimate cost savings. Wastes were analyzed for each method. Statistical analyses using Student t-tests were used to determine statistical differences and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Overall, the use of optimized trays and sealed sterilization containers reduced the turnover time by 57 minutes and the number of trays by a mean of three. OR and CS processing yearly savings were estimated to be $249,245. Waste disposal was an estimated 10,590 ounces and 450 ounces for traditional and sealed containers, respectively. Novel sealed sterilization containers demonstrated increased efficiency in the total turnover time of TKA trays. This is important for surgeons participating in bundle payments who perform surgery in a hospital and ambulatory surgery center. Reduced turnover time could potentially increase case load and decrease the need for extra instrumentation or loaner trays. This simple means of increasing efficiency could be used as a model for surgeons wishing to streamline surgical trays and reduce costs.

However, there is some uncertainty regarding the durability of the therapeutic effect in terms of recurrent disease. Objective and significance: The aim of this study will be to evaluate the outcome of THD compared to Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy in terms of recurrence rate at 1-year follow-up. This is a multicenter, parallel-arm, non-randomized prospective study comparing Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and THD in terms of recurrence rate at one year. The primary endpoint is recurrence rate at one year defined as prolapsing internal hemorrhoids at physical examination. Secondary endpoints include the following postoperative complications: urinary retention, constipation (requiring laxative or emergency room visit), dysuria, pruritis ani, anal pain, anal stenosis, unhealed wound, fissure, fecal urgency, and flatus or stool incontinence. Adults older than 18 years with prolapsed, non-incarcerated, reducible hemorrhoids in at least 3 columns at physical examination will be included in one of the study arms: Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and THD. Surgeons with proven expertise in hemorrhoids surgery will enroll patients undergoing Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and THD (not both). Each participating surgeon will enroll a maximum of 10 patients. Ethics and Dissemination: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Stony Brook University (previously) and New York Medical College (currently), and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03245086).

This review seeks to provide concise insight into the current state of parastomal hernia repair using a hernia mesh, with a particular focus on biologic mesh. Surgical techniques and clinical outcomes of the \"keyhole\", modified Sugarbaker, and sandwich procedures are described. The current body of evidence on prophylactic biologic mesh placement to prevent parastomal hernia is discussed. Current evidence (while not high-quality) supports the hypothesis that prophylactic biologic mesh placement may decrease parastomal hernia rates. Further experimental and observational clinical studies are required to better understand the role of prophylactic mesh placement to prevent parastomal hernia in patients undergoing colorectal resection with permanent ostomy.","179":null,"180":"Robotic-assisted surgery was introduced to make various mechanical aspects of a total hip arthroplasty more reproducible.

It is currently the third most common bariatric procedure worldwide; more than19,000 operations (4.8%) are performed per year. OAGB is synonymous with \"Mini Gastric Bypass\" and \"Omega Loop Gastric Bypass\". There are numerous technical variants for performing OAGB and organizing pre- and postoperative care. This article is based on the approach to bariatric surgery at the Department of General Surgery at Vienna Medical University. We focus on patient preparation before a bariatric\/metabolic procedure with mandatory and optional examinations to decrease the patient's risk and find the procedure best suited for each individual patient. Next, the surgical technique itself is described, including positioning of the patient, positioning of the trocars and related tips, tricks, and technical highlights, as well as the specifics of the postoperative course. OAGB is an effective procedure for weight loss and remission of comorbidities with a low risk of malnutrition for patients with good compliance. For OAGB to be successful, important technical steps such as a long and narrow pouch, exact length of the biliopancreatic limb and hiatoplasty, if necessary, should be taken. In terms of post-operative care, regular check-ups are vital to ensure a positive outcome in long-term follow-up and the early detection of adverse developments.","186":null,"187":null,"188":null,"189":null,"190":"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are the most costly and serious complication for patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Among patients with DM, 4% annually and up to one third in their entire lifetime may experience a DFU. The majority of DFU do not heal in a timely fashion and non-healing is associated with complications including skin, soft tissue, bone and systemic infection as well as the need for amputation. While education and advances in standard care for DFU have occurred, more research is critical to identify new and better therapies for patients with DFU. In this review, we examine ongoing clinical trials (through clinicaltrials.gov) on treatments for DFU. Our review focuses on new, upcoming therapies, including topical agents, dressings, engineered tissue, cell therapy, growth factors, devices, and herbal\/natural remedies. The preclinical background information for each of these new therapies is also reviewed and discussed.","191":"Cryoneurolysis, otherwise known as cryoanalgesia, is a process of addressing nerve-related pain via disruption of nerve conduction utilizing extreme cold temperatures. Throughout the literature, cryoneurolysis has been described for decades across various specialties. Within the past few years, a growing movement of its application within orthopedics has provided pain relief solutions in both the non-surgical and surgical space. A review of the literature utilizing multiple medical search engines was performed to identify relevant orthopedic articles related to the treatment of joint pain with cryoneurolysis or cryoanalgesia. A review of the cryoneurolysis, indications, efficacy, and treatment gaps within the literature were identified to provide guidance for future research.","192":"Major gastrointestinal complications after arthroplasty are rare, but can have detrimental effects on the patient and can substantially increase the overall cost of treatment. This systematic review provides an overview of ileus, gastrointestinal bleeding and C. difficile colitis after total hip and knee arthroplasty. We followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched 3 databases for the period between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2018. The manual search included references in retrieved articles. We extracted data on the cohort size, study level, arthroplasty procedure, complications and their incidence, and recommendations by the study. Twenty-five studies that analyzed these complications after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) were identified. These complications have an incidence of up to 2% each. According to some of the studies, an incidence of 0% is possible. While the risk factors for ileus varied greatly, those for C. difficile colitis were more consistent. There are some recommendations for reducing the incidence of ileus and C. difficile. This heterogeneity does not allow us to draw any conclusion regarding which thromboprophylaxis agent has the lowest incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. The complications investigated in this systematic review are rare and have a reported incidence of up to 2% each. Even though there are some recommendations for reducing the complication rate, due to the complex nature of the arthroplasty setting, there is a need for further investigation of these risk factors and how they can be reduced. ","193":"Revision total hip arthroplasties (rTHAs) are typically more complicated than primaries and may have a greater economic burden. To date, the current economic model supporting these procedures has not been evaluated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the 10-year temporal changes in charges, reimbursement rates, and net losses in patients undergoing an rTHA utilizing a large, nationwide database. A query was performed from 2005 to 2014 to identify patients who underwent rTHA. Analyzed outcomes included trends in costs of care, reimbursement rates, and net losses per annum within the last 10 years. Charges are defined as those by the provider to the insurance company, whereas, reimbursements were those payments received from the insurance company. Net losses were calculated as the difference in charges from reimbursement rates. Total charges increased from $1,119,725,881 in 2005 to $2,066,842,547 in 2014. Total reimbursements increased from $287,461,852 in 2005 to $478,430,569 in 2014. Per patient charges increased 67.4% from 2005 to 2014 and from $51,963.18 in 2005 to $86,791.07 in 2014. There was an increase in reimbursement per patient of 61.4% from $12,450.70 in 2005 to $20,090.31 in 2014. Net losses increased 68.80%, from $39,512.48 to $66,700.76 from 2005 to 2014. This study indicates substantial increases in charges and reimbursements over a 10-year period for patients undergoing rTHA. However, reimbursement increased at a lower rate than that of charges, resulting in major net losses. This study highlights the need to reevaluate the economic models behind rTHA for longer-term sustainment. ","194":"Urologic involvement is seen in 1.2-3.9% of women with endometriosis. The bladder (84%) is the most common location of urinary tract endometriosis and the retro-trigone and dome of the bladder are the most frequently affected sites. Ureteral involvement is commonly extrinsic and leads to compression and fibrosis of peri-ureteral tissue, leading to obstruction. Robotic-assisted laparoscopy provides additional advantages of 3D visualization, shorter learning curve compared to conventional laparoscopy, improved dissection in tight pelvic spaces, and facilitation of suturing techniques. In this review, we present the multidisciplinary management of four cases of deep infiltrating endometriosis of the urinary tract in a tertiary referral center of expertise and a review of the literature.","195":"As studies continue to provide advanced knowledge concerning abdominal wall closure after laparotomy, there have been many improvements in surgical techniques and recommended closure materials. However, there continues to be a high rate of incisional hernias following exploratory laparotomies. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of available educational models for laparotomy closure. A comprehensive literature review was made using PubMed, Cochrane, and NCBI MeSH databases to find the most relevant articles associated with various abdominal closure models using specific keywords. Human cadaver, animal, synthetic, and virtual reality models were reviewed. Strengths and limitations of each model were described. Each model has practical benefits in its ability to mimic in vitro anatomy and the experiential similarities to actual laparotomy closure. However, there are also limitations and potential cost-prohibitive factors for individual models. Overall, while there have been some advances in synthetic and virtual models, human cadaver and porcine models remain the most similar to human abdominal wall closures. ","196":"As a major institute in the field of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery, we constantly endeavor to develop and perform the least-invasive surgeries possible. In laparoscopy and robot-assisted laparoscopy, we should expect that complex surgeries that are currently undertaken with the use of many ports of a given diameter will eventually be accomplished with smaller incisions and fewer ports. There will always be clinical scenarios that require a more invasive approach, either because of adhesive tissues or a complex pathology. However, many routine cases will yield themselves to extremely minimally invasive techniques. In this report, we explain how we designed and ultimately used an improvised 11mm laparoscopic single-port system to perform a single-port hysterectomy through a bluntly created 11mm incision. The system was completely devised using currently available and easily obtainable surgical equipment approved in the United States, to maximize the reproducibility of the surgery. The surgery includes the creation of a working incision using an 11mm blunt laparoscopic trocar, to consistently produce a repeatedly small footprint. The surgery was performed successfully and without complication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the smallest reported single-incision hysterectomy.","197":"Treatment of post-surgical pain is predicated by an understanding of pain generators. The purpose of this review is to identify sensory dependent areas of the shoulder and discuss their correlation in treating postoperative pain. Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews were searched (key terms: \"Nociception\" or \"sensory pain receptors\" or \"pain map\" or \"neuroanatomy and shoulder\" or \"rotator cuff\") to identify studies in the current literature (1966-2018) regarding sensory innervation of the shoulder and rotator cuff. The search was limited to the English language, human studies, and publication types to reviews and clinical studies. Articles written in other languages besides English, animal studies, abstracts, and conference notes were excluded. Each search result was investigated for relevant physiological information of the nerve endings and nociceptors as well as pertinent information and figures that illustrated the location of the identified receptors. A total of 12 articles were identified that addressed the sensory innervation of the shoulder. The shoulder capsule has the highest sensory nerve density. The attachment sites between the labrum and the capsule and glenoid rim were also found to be highly sensory dependent, in contrast to the peri-core zone at the capsulolabral junction, which was found to be less concentrated with fascicles and sensory nerve endings. The subacromial bursa is also a highly sensory dependent structure, with a more concentrated neural network on the coracoacromial side compared to other quadrants of the bursa. Cutaneous locations of sensory fibers on the shoulder are best defined by mapping the pressure pain threshold (PPT) of various locations on the shoulder. The most sensory dependent locations of the shoulder were found to be the posterior border of the acromion, the glenohumeral joint, the anterior deltoid, and the upper trapezius. This review examined the origin of pain in the shoulder, the location of cutaneous pain receptors, and receptors in each major part of the shoulder. Providing analgesia to these densely innervated areas of the shoulder can potentially reduce pain associated with surgical trauma. In addition, knowledge of the sensory dependent areas of the shoulder may elicit consideration of alternative incision sites and surgical protocols to decrease the insult to nociceptors in these locations. These changes could possibly decrease the narcotic requirement in the postoperative period. ","198":"Positive identification of the biliary anatomy is a crucial step during laparoscopic cholecystectomy to prevent iatrogenic biliary injuries. While it is usually quite straightforward in elective cholecystectomies, it may be very challenging in an emergency setting, when inflammation and adhesions at the gallbladder pedicle make identification of the common bile duct a difficult and risky manoeuvre. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a dye that, when injected intravenously at 0.2-0.5 mg\/kg, concentrates in the bile and becomes fluorescent under near-infrared light. When administered well in advance, ideally 24 hours before the procedure, ICG is completely cleared by the liver and reaches a good concentration in the bile, thus allowing a good fluorescence-cholangiogram. Unfortunately, in emergency cholecystectomy-when it would be most needed-the injection of ICG cannot be planned with such long notice. However, even when injected less than 1 hour before the operation, ICG may be able to reach a sufficient concentration in the bile. This report shows that ICG-fluorescence can be helpful in identifying the extrahepatic biliary anatomy during the dissection of Calot's triangle in both elective and emergency cases.","199":null,"200":"The risk of recurrent mitral regurgitation after surgical mitral valve repair for ischemic functional mitral regurgitation is 28 % at 10 years. Also, an increasing number of patients with degenerated mitral bioprostheses are seen in daily clinical practice due to a dramatic shift from mechanical to biological bioprostheses over the past few decades. Therefore, it can be anticipated that there will be growing need for therapy options to treat high-risk patients in case of recurrent mitral regurgitation subsequent to surgical mitral valve repair or replacement. Interventional therapy for failing surgical mitral valve replacement and repair is an appealing option in patients who are ineligible for redo surgery. The efficacy and safety of transcatheter mitral valve replacement have been reported in patients with failing mitral rings or degenerated mitral bioprostheses. However, crucial limitations remain, including possible device malpositioning, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and postprocedural mitral regurgitation. Partially, these complications can be explained by the most frequently used transcatheter heart valves, which are balloon-expanding bioprostheses intended for transcatheter aortic valve implantation that cannot be repositioned. Currently, frequently used approaches for transcatheter mitral valve replacement include retrograde transapical and antegrade transseptal techniques, most often with the use of transcatheter heart valves from the Sapien family (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) followed by the mechanical expandable Lotus valve (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MS, USA). Anecdotal reports have described the application of self-expandable transcatheter heart valves (Centera; Edwards) or dedicated transcatheter mitral valve replacement devices. In this report, we give an overview of current interventional techniques, available evidence and reported outcomes for transcatheter mitral valve replacement for degenerated bioprosthetic valves and failed annuloplasty rings.","201":null,"202":"Traumatic spinal injury presents the potential for significant morbidity and mortality, and posterior fixation and fusion with bone grafts is a primary treatment for many vertebral fractures. While iliac crest autograft (ICBG) is considered the gold standard in bone grafting, this carries risks of morbidity at the donor site as well as prolonging surgery time. Bone graft substitutes (BGS) may provide a viable alternative to autograft but there is little published data concerning its use in trauma. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective review to evaluate the outcomes for fusion among patients who have received a BGS during posterolateral fusion (PLF) for vertebral trauma. This was a retrospective, consecutive patient cohort. Over a six-month period, we identified 27 patients who had undergone PLF for spine trauma and in whom a BGS comprised of bovine-derived apatite was used. All patients had followed the standard of care. The postoperative plain film radiographs at three, six, 12, and (optionally) 24 months were independently assessed by an orthopedic surgeon who was not affiliated with the hospital. We documented a radiographically observed fusion rate of 85% and a successful treatment rate of 92%. There were no adverse events related to the BGS. Patients who received a BGS with ICBG spent significantly longer in surgery than other patients. There were no adverse events related to the BGS. The spondylodesis rate following surgery in which the BGS was used in PLF, whether alone, mixed with local bone, or mixed with ICBG is comparable to the rates that have been reported for iliac crest autograft in these indications. The data indicates that the BGS provides a useful adjunct in PLF for the treatment of traumatic spine vertebral injuries. The use of BGS also allows for shorter time in surgery, which may reduce resource utilization and thus lower the total costs of the procedure. Posterolateral fusion can be obtained with the use of a bio-derived BGS while reducing the time in surgery by avoiding the second procedure necessary to harvest ICBG. This may be advantageous in cases where the surgeon wishes to minimize operating time or when the availability of autograft is limited. ","203":"","204":"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty represents an increasingly utilized surgical technology; however, there remains clinical question whether the technique produces improved clinical and patient-reported outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate early clinical outcomes and patient preference of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) versus manual TKA (mTKA) in a direct crossover cohort of patients who underwent consecutive TKAs by each technique. A retrospective chart review and telephone interview was performed on 36 patients who underwent both rTKA and mTKA by a single surgeon between 2012-2018. Perioperative outcomes-complications\/reoperations and patient-preferred technique-were collected with mean clinical follow up of 4.8 and 2.0 years for mTKA and rTKA, respectively. mTKA were performed significantly (p&lt;0.01) more quickly than rTKA, including shorter tourniquet time (56 versus 73 minutes) and total operating room time (93 versus 116 minutes). rTKA patients length of stay (LOS) was significantly (p&lt;0.01) decreased (1.8 days) compared to mTKA (2.3 days). For rTKA and mTKA, respectively, there was no difference in final range of motion (119 versus 122 degrees), Visual Analog Scale (1.6 versus 0.9), or Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Jr (85 versus 87). Twenty (56%) reported rTKA as the preferred technique over mTKA. In same patient direct comparison, rTKA required longer operative time but improved LOS compared to mTKA. There was no difference in final outcomes with only slightly more patients preferring rTKA. ","205":"In an era when the costs of surgical care are becoming increasingly scrutinized, the introduction of new technologies that may improve clinical outcomes can be limited due to economic constraints. Thus, bundled care payment models have emerged to reduce costs, improve outcomes and increase overall value. Since a bundle is a single reimbursement per episode of care that includes the surgical costs, as well as postoperative care and rehabilitation, cost savings are generally achieved through a reduction of services, complications and\/or materials used. The present study demonstrates significant cost savings with a 90-day bundle for sensor-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA).","206":"The prognostic factors for long-term survival after curative resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to identify the prognostic factors of long-term survival after resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma based on actual 5-year survival including different lymph node status classifications. A total of 106 patients who underwent pancreatectomy were enrolled at our institution and retrospectively analyzed according to actual survival (&gt; vs &lt; 5 years), as well as several currently available node classifications: N0\/N1, N0\/N1\/N2, and lymph-node ratio (LNR) including multivariate logistic regression. The actual 5-year overall survival rate of the series was 12.26%. In a univariate analysis, operative blood loss and blood transfusion, completion of adjuvant treatment, histological differentiation, perineural invasion, N0\/N1, N0\/N1\/N2 and LNR were significant predictive factors for actual long-term survival. A multivariate analysis showed that only N0\/N1 was an independent predictive factor for actual 5-year survival (OR: 1.593; 0.730-1.325; p= 0.264). The nodal involved status is the strongest independent unfavorable factor for actual long-term survival after pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma. ","207":null,"208":"The Drummond marginal artery and the Riolan's arch are important links between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), which provide collateral flow in case of arterial occlusion or significant stenosis. The Riolan's arch is important in colorectal surgery since it allows for vascularization of the descending colon by the SMA after ligation of the IMA at its origin, especially in cancer patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the presence of the Drummond marginal artery and the Riolan's arch. In addition, we assessed anatomic variants of the middle colic artery (MCA) and classified the anatomic relationships between SMA and SMV. Following screening, 115 abdominal CT scans were included in the study. For all cases, the presence of the Drummond marginal artery and the Riolan's arch, the first diameter of these arterial structures at their origins, the first emerging diameter and anatomic variants of the MCA, and the anatomic relationships between SMA and SMV were evaluated. Drummond marginal artery was present in all participants (100%). The Riolan's arch was observed in 27.8% of all cases and was higher than in other studies. This can be related to the focus of this arch. In addition, we did not find any similar study in the literature that evaluated MCA origin types, SMA-SMV variants with the presence of the Drummond artery and the Riolan's arch, and the first emerging diameters of vascular structures, such as the Drummond marginal artery, the Riolan's arch, and MCA. Evaluating and stating whether the Drummond marginal artery and the Riolan's arch are seen in thin section abdominal computed tomography (CT) and CT angiographies preoperatively may help in planning appropriate resections and can reduce unwanted postoperative morbidity. ","209":"Recent studies have shown that biofeedback devices are effective for weight-bearing (WB) training. However, these devices have limitations due to high costs and inadequate evidence of their effectiveness among poor-compliance individuals. This study aimed to assess WB compliance after touchdown weight-bearing (TDWB) training by the standard bathroom scale (BS) method and to evaluate the efficacy of our innovative simple auditory feedback device (Sim-Insole). In this crossover study, healthy volunteers were trained for TDWB (targeting 20% of bodyweight [BW]) with the BS method and assessed with the Sim-Insole without feedback (phase 1), and then completed a 30-min wash-out period and underwent re-assessment with Sim-Insole with feedback (phase 2). Satisfaction was evaluated with a self-assessment questionnaire. Those who had and had not experienced a weight-bearing force (WBF) &gt;25% of BW were classified as high-risk and low-risk groups, respectively. Steps with percentage of WB &amp;15%, 15%-25%, and &gt;25% were defined as under-zone, in-zone, and over-zone, respectively. Fourteen volunteers (70%) were classified as high-risk after the BS method. Without auditory feedback, the high-risk group demonstrated a significantly higher average percentage of WB and higher average lowest WBF compared to the low-risk group (18.8% vs. 13.7% and 74.3N vs. 60.2N, respectively, p=0.002 for both). With the use of auditory feedback with Sim-Insole in the high-risk group, the cadence, percentage of WB, highest absolute WBF, proportion of over-zone step, and confidence for TDWB improved significantly compared to those with the BS method (p&amp;0.05 for all). However, the low-risk group showed only a significant improvement in cadence (p=0.047) and a non-significant trend for improvement in the percentage of WB (p=0.089), compared to the BS method. Sim-Insole is effective for TDWB training. This device significantly improved WB compliance with regard to excessive WB, walking speed, and the confidence of volunteers in the high-risk group with poor compliance. ","210":"Postoperative air leakage does not always originate from parenchymal defects. In some cases, it may arise from defects in the chest drainage unit itself or connections, or from reverse airflow in water seals. The aim of the present study was to test a new chest drainage unit in the clinic, where an integrated CO2-sensitive colour indicator helps to distinguish false air leakage from true air leakage. Over a 3-week period, 14 consecutive patients were operated upon using either an open approach (for bilobectomies) or VATS (for diagnostic procedures or lobectomies). All patients received general anaesthesia with double-lumen intubation. All patients had a 24-Fr chest tube connected to a chest drainage unit with a built-in CO2-detector. In all patients with air leakage after surgery, we found a colour change in the CO2-sensitive colour indicator, confirming \"true air leakage\". One patient had prolonged air leakage. None of the patients had pneumothorax after removal of the chest tube and no patients had wound infections or any other complications. The chest drainage unit described here was easily implemented in the clinic and clearly confirmed true air leakage in all patients with air leakage after lung surgery. It allowed safe and appropriate timing for chest tube removal with no need for reinsertion in a broad cohort of patients referred for thoracic surgery. ","211":"The use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has expanded as an alternative to aortic valve replacement, and more than 500,000 patients have been treated worldwide since April, 2002. The aim of this study was to compare complications and morbidity\/mortality associated with different TAVI approaches as alternatives to a surgical-femoral approach. From January 2007 to January 2015, 2,863 patients underwent TAVI surgery in 36 United Kingdom TAVI centers. Primary outcomes were complications according to VARC-2 criteria. The secondary outcome was long-term survival. The enrolled patients were distributed as follows: 1,150 in the surgical-femoral (SF) group, 1,216 in the trans-apical (TA) group, 207 in the direct-aortic (DA) group, and 290 in the subclavian (SC) group. There were no differences in the rates of acute myocardial infarction, emergency valve-in-valve, cardiac tamponade, or TIA among the groups. The rates of stroke and renal replacement therapy, as well as in-hospital stay, in-hospital death, and 30-day and 12-month mortality in DA and TA were higher than those in SC and SF. The rates of paravalvular leak and balloon post-dilatation in SC and DA were higher than those in TA and SF. The rates of vascular injuries and permanent pacemaker implantation in SC and SF were higher than those in DA and TA. SF provided the best long term-survival (p = 0.008). This was a large study that compared outcomes and long-term survival among different TAVI surgical approaches in a national real-world setting. According to our results, SF provided the best survival. While SC provided worse survival than SF, it was still better than TA and DA, and thus may represent the safest non-femoral access if use of the femoral approach is precluded. ","212":"Epigastric hernias may lead to discomfort and pain. The mainstay of treatment is surgical repair with mesh reinforcement. The primary aim of this study was to compare the recurrence rates of laparoscopic epigastric hernia repair (LEHR) and conventional open epigastric hernia repair (OEHR) with mesh reinforcement. Secondary aims were to evaluate perioperative outcomes and quality of life. Ninety-nine patients (58% female) from two non-academic hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. The Short-Form 36 Health Survey questionnaire and Carolina Comfort Scale were used to assess quality of life and complaints related to mesh implantation. Forty-two (42%) patients underwent LEHR and 57 (58%) underwent OEHR. The mean follow-up at the outpatient clinic was 7.1 months in the LEHR group and 8.1 months in the OEHR group. The mean follow-up by telephone contact was 67.8 months in the OEHR group and 58.1 months in the LEHR group. The risk of recurrence appeared to be slightly lower for LEHR (2%) compared to OEHR (7%), but this difference was not significant (p=0.298). The median surgical duration was 54 minutes in the LEHR group and 28 minutes in the OEHR group (p&lt;0.001). The median hospitalization time was 1 day in the LEHR group and 0.5 days in the OEHR group (p&lt;0.001). Laparoscopic hernia repair tended to be associated with a lower risk of recurrence, but this difference was not statistically significant. Although the surgical duration was longer for the LEHR group, the postoperative outcomes were similar between groups, making laparoscopic repair a feasible alternative to the open approach for epigastric hernias. ","213":"With constantly evolving materials and techniques used in wound closure management for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), it is imperative that we continuously evaluate new modalities and techniques to optimize healing. This article provides a concise review of the current closure and wound management methods for each of the following three layers and dressing: 1) deep fascia layer, or arthrotomy; 2) subdermal layer or subcutaneous layer; 3) skin and subcuticular layer; and 4) dressing application. By introducing a comprehensive and systematic approach to TKA wounds, this report also incorporates newer modalities such as barbed sutures and adhesive dressings, which have increasingly replaced traditional suture and staple methods. Furthermore, we examine how various layers of modern wound closure compare to conventional methods while discussing both the clinical and economic impacts of each. Newer wound management methods, such as the adhesive and occlusive dressings with varying monofilament subcuticular sutures, can eliminate the need for staple and suture removal, increase the value of care provided, limit unnecessary postoperative visits, and potentially address wound issues by communicating safely with patients via telemedicine, an ever-relevant discussion in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","214":"In vascular surgery, bypass procedures are standard treatments for many arterial and venous diseases. The choice of conduit for the bypass operation is fundamental in planning for the appropriate intervention for each individual patient. Although an autogenous conduit is superior, this option is not available in many patients, and prosthetic grafts have been the preferred conduit in a variety of clinical situations. However, since prosthetic graft infections are seen in all realms of vascular surgery, from arteriovenous access to aortic graft infections and lower-extremity bypass infections, cryopreserved arterial and venous allografts, which are relatively resistant to infection, have become the conduit of choice. This discussion will focus on the clinical applications of cryopreserved allografts in vascular surgery, specifically lower-extremity peripheral bypass, aortic disease, and dialysis access.","215":"Outpatient hysteroscopy can be a painful procedure for some patients and there is still no consensus regarding analgesia use. We evaluated which types and modalities of analgesia are most commonly used in a select group of hysteroscopists. A 15-item questionnaire was created to assess the use of routine analgesia during office hysteroscopy. The SurveyMonkey portal (https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/) was used to administer the questionnaire. Of the 400 hysteroscopists who were approached, 229 replied. Routine pre-procedural or intra-procedural analgesia was used by 34% of hysteroscopists (67% of these reported using NSAIDs, 12% paracetamol, 7% opioids 13.5% other). Among hysteroscopists who routinely used intra-procedural analgesia, 46.1% reported using a paracervical block, 15.4% used an intracervical blockage, 15.4% had the patient listen to music during the procedure, 3.8% used local anesthetics, as in a spray or gel on the surface of the cervix, and 19.2% used some other method. Regarding misoprostol use, 75% of hysteroscopists reported not using it routinely. Our results are consistent with poor evidence from published studies that there is a low prevalence of routine analgesia use during outpatient hysteroscopy. ","216":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and secondary hepatic malignancies, most often arising from colorectal cancer, are a leading cause of morbidity and cancer-related deaths worldwide. In lieu of first-line surgical resection, which is precluded in more than 75% of cases due to underlying comorbid conditions or locally advanced disease, several minimally-invasive transarterial and thermal ablation procedures have emerged as safe and effective alternative therapies in select patients. Among the thermal ablative techniques, microwave ablation (MWA) has become the preferred treatment modality because of its operational convenience and superior heating profile, allowing for larger ablation zones and reduced treatment times while maintaining high technical success rates. To date, MWA has been demonstrated to provide equivalent, and in some cases improved, clinical outcomes compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with inoperable HCC or oligometastatic disease. Active areas of investigation include the comparison of MWA and transarterial therapies, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), as well as combined multimodality therapies. Here we review the emerging topic of MWA for the treatment of hepatic malignancies by examining staging and treatment strategies, available technologies, procedural protocol and technique, and clinical outcomes.","217":null,"218":"Virtual reality arthroscopic simulators are becoming increasingly prevalent in the orthopaedic training environment. The construct validity of the ArthroSim virtual reality simulator (TolTech Touch of Life Technologies, Aurora, Colorado) has been established based on time to completion comparison between candidates of differing levels of surgical experience. This study aims to establish the construct validity of the ArthroSim virtual reality simulator using validated global rating scales that allow direct comparison with intraoperative performance. Eight novices (medical students), eight intermediates (registrars), and seven experts (consultants) were assessed using the Imperial Global Arthroscopy Rating Scale (IGARS) and the Arthroscopic Surgical Skills Evaluation Tool (ASSET) scoring systems while carrying out a standardised basic diagnostic knee arthroscopy using linked and anonymised recordings of both the arthroscopy video output and candidate's hand posture and position. Time to completion was recorded and the expert group also filled out questionnaires assessing the face and content validity of the simulator. The mean IGARS\/ASSET scores for the novice, intermediate and expert groups were 14\/11, 29\/22, and 46\/36 respectively. The difference in score between each of the groups was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). The average time to completion was 257 seconds, 305 seconds, and 204 seconds respectively. The time to completion was not significantly different between the groups (p=0.6). The ArthroSim virtual reality simulator could effectively distinguish between candidates of differing experience levels using validated global rating scales and therefore demonstrated construct validity. ","219":"Modern surgical methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the number of technical devices that are used during these interventions is increasing. However, the surgical operating room (OR) remains a mere conglomerate of unconnected medical devices. The increase in the complexity of device functionality, in addition to the demands of surgery, pushes human mental capacity to its limit. Hence, an \"intelligent\" collaborative support system would be more than welcome. We envision a \"human-like\" intelligent system, which could support the surgical team as a situation-aware consultant. This so-called \"active collaborative support system\" (ACSS) is based on four main pillars: real-time data inflow, a comprehensive knowledge-base, access to the Internet of Things (surgical devices), and an understanding of human language through natural language processing. Recent advances in the area of AI are bringing this ambitious goal within reach, but there is still a considerable amount of work to be done, including the establishment of a new way of thinking in the collaboration between surgeons and computer scientists\/engineers, and possibly one day with intelligent machines-provided that AI systems can be sufficiently trusted.","220":null,"221":"A robotic surgical approach provides advantages compared to laparoscopy in male patients with mid- and low-lying rectal cancer located in the narrow pelvic space. The aim of this report is to present a single-surgeon experience with robotic sphincter-saving total mesorectal excision of rectal cancer in male patients. A series of 103 consecutive male patients who underwent robotic rectal surgery between January 2012 and June 2019 were analyzed retrospectively in terms of demographics, histopathological data, and surgical and oncological outcomes. All of the patients underwent robotic sphincter-saving resection: 76 (73.8%) underwent low-anterior resection and 27 (26.2%) underwent intersphincteric resection with colo-anal anastomosis. There was no conversion. The median distal resection margin of the operative specimen was 3 (0.2-7) cm. The circumferential resection margin was positive in 3 (2.91%) cases. The median number of retrieved lymph nodes was 22 (18-42). The median hospital stay was 4 (3-16) days. Whereas the overall morbidity was 13%, there was no in-hospital or 30-day mortality. The median length of follow-up was 48 (9-80) months. The 5-year overall survival rate was 87%. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 84%. Local and distant recurrence rates were 3.8% and 5.82%, respectively. In male patients with rectal cancer, a robotic approach is a promising alternative and is expected to overcome the low penetration rate of laparoscopy in this field.

A variety of surgical techniques allow surgeons to achieve a high rate of success with mitral valve repair, even in complex cases, and mitral valve repair is associated with better long-term outcomes than valve replacement. However, in the setting of mitral valve surgical repair, systolic anterior motion (SAM) is a complication that determines the dynamic anterior movement of the mitral valve towards the interventricular septum during systole, and creates a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction associated with residual mitral regurgitation. Awareness of risk factors for SAM influences operative planning for repair. Predictors of SAM are known and can be definitively evaluated with intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, but SAM still complicates mitral valve repair and, if untreated, negatively impacts short-term and long-term outcomes. A stepwise approach in SAM correction is advocated, consisting of medical therapy with aggressive volume-loading and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, but severe or persistent SAM requires surgical revision with a second cross-clamping or a redo procedure. The correct choice of surgical technique requires a deep understanding of the anatomical substrate of SAM, as SAM can be due to different mechanisms that require tailored surgical correction to avoid ineffective or potentially dangerous procedures. This paper reviews the mechanisms and predictors of SAM and summarizes the current concepts of intraoperative and postoperative SAM management.","226":"Robotic-assisted donor nephrectomy has become increasingly popular in recent years. We sought to compare robotic-assisted outcomes to operative outcomes in a historical cohort of laparoscopic donor nephrectomies. A retrospective review of 58 consecutive donor nephrectomies at a single center by two surgeons from 2015 to 2019 was performed. Robotic-assisted (n = 32) and laparoscopic (n =26) donors were comparable in terms of estimated blood loss (66.4 vs. 62.5 mL; p=0.81) and length of stay (1.6 vs. 1.5 days; p=0.37). The post-operative change in creatinine was not significantly different between the groups (-0.45 vs. -0.45; p=0.97). Warm ischemia time was longer in the robotic group (7.36 vs. 5.15 minutes; p &lt; 0.01). Case duration was significantly longer for robotic-assisted cases (306 vs. 247 minutes; p &lt; 0.01). However, robotic cases were more likely to be right-sided (6\/32 (18.8%) vs. 1\/26 (3.8%)) and have vascular multiplicity (7\/32 (21.9%) vs. 0\/26 (0%)). There was one Clavien II or greater complication in the robotic group, and none in the laparoscopic group. Our data agree with previous reports that robotic-assisted donor nephrectomy is safe and has similar outcomes to a laparoscopic approach. Moreover, cases with multiple renal arteries or veins and right-sided cases were completed safely using the robotic approach. The longer case duration in the robotic group was attributed to the learning curve associated with implementing a new technique, and later robotic operative times approached laparoscopic operative times.

Long-term durability and avoidance of infection relapse are the goals of the procedure. However, no detailed guidelines on prosthesis selection and surgical strategies are available, which should be guided by a comprehensive evaluation of the extent of the infection and its microbiological characteristics, the clinical profile of the patient and the risk of infection recurrence. Conventional mechanical or stented xenografts are the preferred choice for localized heart infection. In cases of complex IE with involvement of the root or the aorto-mitral continuity, the use of homograft is suggested according to the surgeon's and center's experience. The use of homograft needs to be balanced against the risk of structural degeneration. Prosthetic bioroot and prosthetic valved conduit with a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve are also considered acceptable alternatives in patients with aortic valve endocarditis. The further development of preservation techniques to enable the longer durability of allogeneic substitutes is required.

Robotic surgery adds high definition visualization and articulating instruments. This enhanced dexterity can make laparoscopic hernia repair more refined while obtaining a critical view of the myopectineal orifice that should lead to fewer recurrences and complications. A series of robotic, laparoscopic, inguinal hernia repairs by a single surgeon with extensive laparoscopic hernia experience at a single institution along with a review of the literature was undertaken to determine the role of robotic laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in minimally invasive surgery. One thousand laparoscopic inguinal hernia operations were performed from April 2012 through March 2020. There were 420 cases of robotic trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) procedures done during that time. Hospital records and follow-up care were prospectively reviewed and data was collected for age, sex, American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) class, and operative time. Follow up was done at two weeks, eight weeks, and 16 weeks following surgery. All patients consented for study. Ninety-four percent (94%) of the patients were male. Age averaged 57.8 years with a range of 18-85 years. ASA averaged 2.01 with comorbidities of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD being the most common. Body mass index (BMI) was between 19-40.5 averaging 26.6. Sixty-three patients (15%) had an umbilical hernia repair done concomitantly. Operating room (OR) time ranged from 25-140 minutes, with an average of 54.36 minutes, and decreased as experience increased. One patient with a large, left scrotal hernia was converted to open, one patient developed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis seven days postoperative and four recurred indirectly after a direct hernia repair. Urinary retention was the most problematic postoperative occurrence. Robotic inguinal hernia repair is safe and effective. 1) Proper training, including simulators and proctors, is necessary; 2) having the same operating room team and an interested first assistant at the OR table is very helpful; 3) the learning curve is about 50 patients; 4) postoperative narcotics are rarely more than three hydrocodone pills; 4) no fixation of the mesh is necessary, but fibrin sealant was used routinely in these patients; and 5) urinary retention is the most common postoperative issue and is best planned for by knowing the patients urinary history, use of peripheral alpha-blockers, and straight catheterization in the OR at the conclusion of the surgery. OR time was longer than standard laparoscopic herniorrhaphy but decreased with experience. The robotic technique allowed for an excellent view of the myopectineal orifice and appears to have a low complication rate.

This paper is a comprehensive, evidence-based and updated review of literature regarding myomectomy techniques. This paper provides general recommendations for myomectomy techniques, including patient selection and surgical planning. Strategies to overcome intraoperative challenges and prevent blood loss are highlighted. In addition, recommendations are provided for tissue extraction and laparoscopic suturing. Myomectomy is a safe and feasible alternative to hysterectomy for patients who wish to bear children. ","236":"Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a surgical emergency with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The treatment of ATAAD is highly individualized and mainly depends on anatomical and technical factors. Great efforts to reduce the time to diagnosis and technological innovations have led to improved surgical results with a lower rate of dissection-related reoperations during long-term follow up. The aim of this article is to introduce a novel hybrid device for the treatment of DeBakey I acute aortic dissection. A non-covered hybrid stent from Ascyrus Medical (Boca Raton, FL, USA) aims to improve the current standard of care, without increasing technical complexity or device-related complications. The AMDS (Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent) prolongs the hemiarch operation by only a few minutes, does not need endovascular skills to be deployed, and provides an anatomical and \"haemodynamic\" correction. The device is intended to reduce perfusion of the false lumen by sealing the distal anastomosis, and to restore distal perfusion of the true lumen. Obliteration of the false lumen at the distal anastomosis is likely to reduce aortic enlargement and the need for reoperations, mainly driven by a low-flow state and pressure reduction, which promote thrombosis. The AMDS provides a new concept to treat acute aortic dissection by moving the focus from resecting the dissected tissue to restoring adequate true-lumen flow and sealing the false lumen at the distal anastomosis. With a high rate of procedural success, AMDS represents a safe, reproducible and promising solution to treat DeBakey I aortic dissections. ","237":"Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with significant mortality and morbidities. Currently, surgical tricuspid repair with annuloplasty is the gold standard treatment. However, the prohibitive risks of open surgery and increasing evidence that severe TR should be intervened on early has led to an outburst in the development and evolution of transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions (TTVI). These technologies are broadly categorized into direct suture annuloplasty devices, minimally invasive annuloplasty, direct ring annuloplasty devices, coaptation-based strategies, edge-to-edge repair devices, and transcatheter valve replacement. Each has its own set of advantages and limitations and have been tried, to varying degrees of success, in a myriad of pathoanatomic scenarios. Challenges faced in TTVI device and trial designs include heterogeneous patient populations, the need for quality imaging, variations of imaging requirements and anatomic criteria by device, hard-to-define clinical endpoints, and the poor prognosis carried by significant residual TR. Similar to tricuspid valve disease, pulmonic valve (PV) disease can occur on its own or secondary to a congenital heart defect, most commonly tetralogy of Fallot. Many patients with pulmonic stenosis or insufficiency often require repeat surgical interventions for other cardiac problems, highlighting the importance of developing transcatheter approaches to reduce the number of repeat open-heart surgeries required. Transcatheter PV replacement (TPVR) is growing in use and is the procedure of choice in patients with failed bioprostheses via valve-in-valve implantation. The Melody (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota) and SAPIEN XT (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Irvine, California) devices are the currently available TPVR technologies. Current limitations here include device kinking, the risk of stent fracture, anatomic difficulties, such as asymmetric right ventricular outflow tracts leading to poor landing zones and procedural risks of coronary artery and aortic root compression.","238":null,"239":"The number of bariatric surgical procedures performed worldwide increases every year and has recently exceeded 685,000. Over 50% of these are laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass accounts for an additional 30%. Bariatric\/metabolic surgery seeks to achieve not only weight loss and the remission of comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus type II, arterial hypertension, sleep apnea, risk of cancer, non-alcoholic liver steatosis, etc., but also improvements in the patient's quality of life. SG is mainly a restrictive procedure consisting of the resection and removal of a major part of the stomach, which has an additional impact on hormones such as Ghrelin and Glucagon-like Peptide 1. The first part of this article focuses on patient preparation before a bariatric procedure with mandatory and additional examinations to decrease the patient's risk. Next, the surgical technique itself, including positioning of the patient, positioning of the trocars and related tips and tricks, and the postoperative course are described. The second part discusses the outcomes of SG, including weight loss, remission of comorbidities and quality of life. Further possible acute complications of SG such as leaks, bleeding or stenoses as well as long-term complications (reflux, weight regain and malnutrition) and respective treatments are also described. In conclusion, SG is an effective procedure for weight loss with a low risk for the patient to develop malnutrition. In terms of post-operative care, regular check-ups are vital to ensure a positive outcome as well as for the early detection of possible issues. Reflux and weight regain are common issues with SG in a long-term follow-up; thus, patients should be selected carefully for this procedure.","240":"Thoracic malignancies pose a significant public health burden in the United States, with primary lung cancer accounting for nearly 25% of cancer deaths each year. Percutaneous thermal ablation (PTA) for the treatment of lung cancer has evolved from a novel oncologic strategy in the 1970s, to a limited therapeutic option in select patients through the early 2000s, into its current rapidly expanding role as an adjunct therapy, or even standalone treatment, for a diverse group of thoracic malignancies in patients with both localized and disseminated disease. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) benefits from the largest clinical dataset and greater user experience, but its utility has been limited by a suboptimal heating mechanism in the setting of poor thermal conductive properties within the lung. As the limitations of RFA have come into sharper focus, microwave ablation (MWA) has emerged as a potentially superior ablation technique due to its ease of use and improved heating profile, allowing for larger ablation zones with reduced treatment times. Cryoablation shares many of the technical features of MWA, while targeting cancer cells via pressurized argon gas to induce cryodestruction of target tissue. In clinical practice, the need for at least two cryoprobes and prolonged freeze-thaw protocols adds to procedural time and complexity. To date, there is considerable evidence supporting the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of these minimally invasive modalities, which have been shown to be cost effective and can often be performed on an outpatient basis. Clinical outcomes continue to improve as more data is acquired for each modality, enabling clinicians to refine patient selection and tailor follow-up protocols to better reflect expected post-procedural imaging findings and potential complications. At present, combined multi-modality therapy is an exciting area of active investigation, particularly in cryoablation due to an apparent synergism with established immunotherapies. Recent data suggests PTA may also be useful in more aggressive malignancies, such as advanced NSCLC and small cell lung cancer. Looking forward, PTA remains well positioned to be a valuable therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with lung cancer.","241":"Despite being widely adopted, the laparoscopic approach to radical and partial nephrectomy is still burdened by high rates of hemorrhagic complications, which require blood transfusions and conversion to open surgery with increased morbidity. While pre-operative renal artery embolization (PRAE) can prevent intraoperative blood loss and vascular injuries, its prophylactic use is still a matter of debate. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of PRAE in overcoming the main pitfalls of laparoscopy, which are related to the absence of tactile feedback. Data from 48 patients who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy for cancer (34 laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN) and 14 \"off-clamp\" laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) after selective and superselective PRAE, respectively) were retrospectively evaluated. The overall median blood loss was 50 ml and only 2 patients (4%) required one unit of blood products. While conversion to open surgery was not required in the LPN group, one case in the LRN group was converted to open surgery due to intraoperative incoercible bleeding from an unrecognized, and thus not embolized, aberrant inferior polar artery. Post-embolization syndrome occurred in 7 patients (15%), resulting in mild flank pain and nausea. No patients in the LPN group experienced new onset of acute renal failure. Our experience supports pre-operative renal embolization as a safe, minimally invasive procedure that is effective for reducing perioperative bleeding in the laparoscopic setting.

Two monoblock implants and three modular implants are available for use in the United States. Although short- and mid-term outcome data have been positive overall for these systems, each construct has unique features that the orthopaedic surgeon might consider when selecting the appropriate implant for his or her patient. In this review article, we discuss the design specifications and published literature for each dual mobility system and organize this information into a concise resource that can be easily referenced during preoperative planning.","244":null,"245":null,"246":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is reaching a broader spectrum of younger patients who struggle with incapacitating hip disease. This study aimed to explore national bearing surface trends for young THA recipients. Specifically, we evaluated bearing surface utilization, patient demographics, and hospital demographics in 20- to 50-year-old THA recipients in the United States from 2009 to 2016. The National Inpatient Sample database was queried for patients aged 20 to 50 who underwent primary THA from 2009-2016 (n=279,190). Patients were grouped according to bearing surface type (metal-on-polyethylene [MOP], metal-on-metal [MOM], ceramic-on-ceramic [COC], and ceramic-on-polyethylene [COP]). Demographics included sex, age, race, obesity status, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), primary payer, median household income, region, and teaching status. Chi-square analyses were employed for categorical variables, while independent t-tests were utilized for continuous variables. The incidence of THA for patients aged 20 to 50 increased slightly from 33,003 in 2009 to 33,545 in 2016 (p&lt;0.001). Overall, bearing surface type was reported in 46.8% (n=127,876) of THAs. Of the THAs with bearing surface codes, the use of MOP (29.6 to 18.7%) and MOM (39.6 to 4.4%) decreased, while COC (9.0 to 14.3%) and COP (21.8 to 62.6%) utilization increased (p&lt;0.001 for all). Those receiving COC implants had the youngest average age (42 years) (p&lt;0.001). Females were more likely to receive COC (44.2%) or COP (43.6%) implants (p&lt;0.001). Obese individuals were more likely to receive MOP (21.3%) or COP (21.2%) (p&lt;0.001). Over an 8-year period, considerable shifts in bearing surface trends have occurred across the United States among 20 to 50-year-old patients. Advantages of ceramic femoral heads, along with increased acceptance of highly cross-linked polyethylene, appear to be reasons for the selection of COP over other bearing surfaces.

While these modifications occur throughout normal brain development, interestingly, they are also elicited after peripheral nerve injury and surgery. This article provides an overview of the principle mechanisms of synaptic, neuronal, cortical and subcortical neuroplasticity, with special attention to cortical and subcortical modifications-as suggested by modern neuroimaging techniques-after peripheral nerve surgery. The main nerve transfer techniques for the superior extremities and their effect on cortical plasticity are also described.","248":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, important elective procedures, such as screening colonoscopy, have been delayed or cancelled, and there may be a very long waitlist for rescheduling once the moratorium is lifted. However, DNA-based stool sample tests may be useful for colorectal cancer screening when colonoscopy is not available. The aim of this review is to demonstrate the potential utility of enhanced DNA-based stool testing for colorectal cancer screening and diagnosis during crises that strain available healthcare resources, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. This review shows that DNA-based stool sample tests have the potential to enable colorectal cancer screening to prioritize patients to elective colonoscopy procedures, the continued delay of which during the COVID-19 pandemic has already placed a burden on future elective procedures.","249":null,"250":"Magnetically controlled intramedullary lengthening nails (MCILN) have revolutionized the field of limb lengthening and deformity correction. They allow for accurate and precise distraction with excellent patient outcomes and satisfaction. Though potentially technically easier than external fixation, general deformity principles and bone and soft-tissue biology must be considered for successful use. MCILN can address deformities of a wide range of etiologies including congenital, posttraumatic, post-infectious, tumor, and many others with excellent healing rates and outcomes as well as better patient satisfaction and similar cost compared to external fixation. Of the approximately 10,000 MCILN that have been implanted (written communication, NuVasive, Inc., San Diego, California), about 749 cases have been reported in the published literature. Applications outside of deformity correction are on the rise, with new uses reported in reconstruction after tumor resection and acute trauma. This review of MCILN summarizes the history, recent advances, and results of MCILN treatment in a multitude of clinical applications.","251":"The ideal fixation methods in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair continue to be debated. Early series touted the importance of suture and tack fixation; however, due to the perceived concern for increased pain, newer tack-only fixation methods have emerged. The purpose of this study was to compare fixation methods in laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs using a large hernia database. We retrospectively reviewed data from the Americas Hernia Society Quality Collaborative (AHSQC) database comparing two groups of fixation (all tacks vs. all sutures and tacks and sutures and permanent tacks vs. sutures and absorbable tacks). The primary outcome measures were hernia recurrence, hospital length of stay, surgical site infection, surgical site occurrence, pain intensity scores, and quality-of-life scores evaluated at 30 days, six months, one year, and two years, Propensity score matching was used to strengthen the retrospective nature of the study. Eight hundred and fifty-two patients were included for analysis; 426 patients with tack-only fixation and 426 with tack and suture fixation. Eight hundred and four total patients were included for analysis; 402 patients with sutures with permanent tacks and 402 patients with sutures and absorbable tacks. For both comparisons, there was no significant difference in hospital length of stay, hernia recurrence rate, surgical site infection rate, surgical site occurrence rate, or surgical site occurrence requiring procedural intervention (p&gt;0.05). There was also no significant difference in pain scores and quality-of-life scores at baseline, 30 days, six months, and one year. The only significant difference was in quality of life at two years. Patients with sutures and tacks had better quality-of-life scores compared with patients with tacks only (64 vs. 39, p&lt;0.001). Data available in the AHSQC database reviewed in this study indicate that there were no clinically significant differences between types of fixation methods when used in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. ","252":null,"253":"Chronic low back pain can be due to many different causes, including degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). For patients who do not respond to conservative management, surgery remains the most effective treatment. Open laminectomy alone and laminectomy and fusion (LF) for DS have been widely investigated, however, no meta-analyses have compared minimally invasive decompression with posterior elements preservation (MID) techniques and LF. Minimally invasive techniques might provide specific advantages that were not recognized in previous studies that pooled different decompression strategies together. This was a systematic review and meta-analysis, according to the PRISMA statement, of comparative studies reporting surgical, clinical and radiological outcomes of MID and LF for DS. A total of 3202 papers were screened and 7 were finally included in the meta-analysis. MID is associated with a shorter surgical duration and hospitalization stay, and a lower intraoperative blood loss and residual low back pain; however, the residual disability grade was lower in the LF group. Complication rates were similar between the two groups. The rate of adjacent segment degeneration was lower in the MID group, whereas data on radiological outcomes were heterogeneous and not suitable for data-pooling. This meta-analysis suggests that MID might be considered as an effective alternative to LF for DS. Further clinical trials will be needed to confirm our results, better investigate radiological outcomes, and identify patient subgroups that may benefit the most from specific techniques. ","254":"Manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has successfully treated end-stage knee osteoarthritis for several years. However, recent technological advancements have enabled surgeons to perform TKA with more accuracy and precision. Aligning the femoral and tibial components perpendicular to the mechanical axes of the femur and tibia is a fundamental principle for restoring knee kinematics and soft-tissue balance. Computer-assisted robotic TKA has proven its ability to fine tune lower leg alignment, component position, and soft-tissue balancing. Furthermore, robotic-assisted TKA (RATKA) offers the additional benefit of improving soft-tissue protection compared to manual techniques. Numerous systems have been developed in the advancement of technology in computer processing, and the number of robotic surgical systems is increasing as well. The three main categories of navigation systems can be classified as: image-based console navigation, imageless console navigation, and accelerometer-based handheld navigation systems. The purpose of this review was to describe emerging technologies for TKA. Specifically, we outline the available literature pertaining to each system with regards to their: (1) accuracy and precision of component alignment; (2) soft-tissue protection; (3) postoperative outcomes; and (4) other reported outcomes such as costs.","255":"Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a considerable risk during emergency colorectal surgery in a pandemic epicenter. It is well known that the primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is through respiratory droplets. However, little is known about shedding of the virus in bodily fluids and associated risks. Although the current moratorium on elective surgery addresses multiple ongoing concerns, including the management of precious resources as well as unknown exposure risks, surgeons undeniably must face and mitigate risks related to exposure to patient airway management-related aerosols, bodily fluids, surgical smoke, contaminated insufflation, and specimen handling in emergency colorectal surgery. Given the significant concern of airborne transmission, the authors recommend conventional, in lieu of laparoscopic, access in emergency colorectal surgery in a COVID-19 pandemic epicenter.","256":null,"257":"The surgical surgical debridement of wounds has evolved over the past 250 years. At that time, the amputation of extremities was recognized as a life-saving procedure to treat major wounds suffered in combat. This continued until after World War I. As the survival of patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions improved, and as advanced therapies were developed to meet the needs of an increasing number of patients with chronic wounds, debridement became a focal point of surgical wound care. It is now well-established that debridement enhances wound-healing and improves the efficacy of advanced therapies and surgical closure. Up until the last two decades, sharp excision with \"cold steel\" was the only option for debridement. In the early 2000's, a high-power waterjet was introduced, and provided a more precise debridement of wound surfaces. As our understanding of biofilms increased, so came the realization that biofilms are stratified within the wound, with anaerobic species preferentially developing deeper within the wound. The latest surgical instrument for wound debridement, the direct contact low frequency ultrasound device (DCLFU), has recently been introduced. A vacuum sheath was added to the active tip to contain spray dispersion. The device is capable of removing all of the wound tissue including biofilm down to a healthy base. This allows for optimal preparation of the wound prior to deployment of an advanced therapy, graft, or flap. This instrumentation is designed specifically for use in the operating room. However, the manufacturer has recently introduced a less powerful, but still effective, version for use in the outpatient clinic. These advances in surgical debridement technology have paved the way for more effective subsequent interventions for treating chronic wounds.","258":null,"259":"","260":"Skeletal muscle represents the largest mass of tissue in the body and is essential for motion and posture. Traumatic injury, tumor ablation, prolonged denervation or genetic defects lead to skeletal myopathies. The loss of muscle function or its regenerative properties often results in pain, deformity, and joint malfunction. The regenerative capacity of skeletal muscles depends on adult muscle stem cells, the so-called satellite cells; however, the population of these myogenic precursors, and thus their potential to restore large muscle tissue defects, is strongly limited. On the other hand, surgical treatment of skeletal muscle loss is hampered by the scarcity of functional replacement tissue. Only a few options currently exist to provide functional and aesthetic restoration of lost muscle tissues, other than free muscle flap transfer. While this reconstructive technique is a common practice, it involves the risk of significant donor-site morbidity. Therefore, alternative cells with the potential to regenerate muscle tissue need to be examined. Recently, many surgeons have studied the potential clinical application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are an adult stem cell population that can undergo differentiation along the mesodermal lineage and secrete growth factors that can enhance tissue regeneration processes by promoting neovascularization. The regenerative potential of MSCs has been widely studied in vitro and in vivo in animal models. MSCs from adipose tissue as well as bone marrow have been shown to bear myogenic potential, which makes them ideal candidate stem cells for skeletal muscle tissue engineering applications. When compared to reconstructive procedures using autograft tissues, MSC therapy offers the potential of reducing or even eliminating donor-site morbidity. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the use of MSCs in in vitro muscle generation and in vivo muscle regeneration.","261":"Proximally coated, morphometric wedge femoral stems illustrated excellent survivorship and clinical outcomes at a minimum five-year postoperative follow up. We completed a retrospective review of 186 THA patients from three high-volume surgeons to assess clinical- and patient-reported outcomes five years after implantation with a cementless, proximally coated morphometric wedge femoral stem. We reviewed Gruen zones on early postoperative and mid-term radiographs for signs of osteolysis, loosening, and wear. Clinical- and patient-reported outcomes were compared with previously published two-year outcomes for these femoral stems. No progression of radiolucencies or loosening was observed radiographically when comparing minimum one-year and five-year follow up. Reactive radiodense lines were observed in 23 cases (12.64%), and 13 cases (7.14%) exhibited true radiolucencies of 1-3mm, and all remained unchanged between follow ups or were no longer present on the five-year film. Cortical hypertrophy was noted in Gruen zones 3 and\/or 5 in 11 cases (6.04%). No stems were revised for mechanical loosening or for periprosthetic fracture. Nine (9) patients (4.87%) underwent revisions during the follow-up period for periprosthetic infection, femoral head and\/or acetabular component revisions, and impingement requiring release and femoral head change. Average Harris Hip Scores were excellent at five years and improved slightly when compared to a two-year follow up; however, this change was not statistically significant. Health-related quality of life mental component and physical component scores were a mean of 48.45 and 43.10 at 5 years, respectively. All cause Kaplan-Meier survivorship of the femoral stem was calculated at 98.4% at an average 65.7 months post implantation. Additionally, this cohort exhibited 100% aseptic survivorship during the follow-up period. Newer-generation morphometric wedge femoral stems for THA exhibit excellent radiographic stability, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes five years post implantation.

Acute encephalopathic syndromes can present a diagnostic challenge due to the wide range of possible etiologies, and can also have vastly different outcomes. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a rare neurological disorder, usually associated with specific medical conditions, that causes a disturbance of CNS homeostasis, while cortical laminar necrosis (CLN) is an unusual type of infarction characterized by selective necrosis of the cerebral cortex with sparing of the white matter. We present a 45-year-old woman who was operated on for left frontal lesion with radiological features compatible with anterior falx meningioma. Postoperative clinical and electroencephalographic data were compatible with non-convulsive status epilepticus originating from the occipito-mesial area. MRI showed bilateral diffuse temporo-occipital abnormally bright cortex as a consequence of neuronal apoptosis compatible with laminar cortical necrosis, and clinical examination revealed persistent cortical blindness. The pathogenesis of encephalopathic syndromes is still unclear. Non-convulsive status epilepticus should be considered as a possible cause of late recovery of consciousness in neurosurgery patients. Delayed treatment may cause irreversible lesions, including in brain areas far from the surgical field.","264":null,"265":"To describe a transforaminal endoscopic spinal decompression technique for treating adult patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis and report preliminary surgical and radiological results. Spondylolisthesis is prevalent in the general population. Surgical approaches for symptomatic spondylolisthesis that is refractory to conservative treatment vary. Direct repair of pars fractures and spinal nerve decompression with or without fusion have been reported with varied clinical results. The de facto gold standard, \"fusion,\" is often associated with high complication rates and costs, and may not be necessary for many patients whose spine is relatively stable. Transforaminal endoscopic lumbar decompression (TFELD) was performed to resect fractured bone or bone fragments and inflamed tissue compressing the exiting nerve root in 2 patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis (grade 1 in one patient and grade 2 in another). We describe the technique step-by-step and assess the Oswestry Disability Index and pain scores for back and leg pain before and after surgery. Radiographic images demonstrated spondylolisthesis with L5 pars fracture. The fractured bone and bone fragment were intraoperatively visible in the gap between facets and fractured pars in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis. The core pathology of the patients was fractured bone and bone fragment coupled with scar or inflamed tissue compressing the exiting L5 nerve roots. After the bone fragments and scar tissue were removed using TFELD, the patients' back and leg pain was significantly reduced, and physical function was restored. For patients with spondylolisthesis-associated low back and leg pain without spinal instability, TFELD is a safe and effective surgical treatment option.

Individuals are more active, younger, and more obese. These changing demographics and a higher demand for longevity creates a new challenge for reliable and long-term implant fixation. Historically, cemented fixation has remained the gold standard, as cementless design and techniques from the 1980s and 1990s did not obtain long-term positive outcomes due to a failure of ingrowth onto the implants. Advances in the modern-day cementless TKA designs appear to have overcome their initial challenges, indicating the dependence of cementless TKA on implant design. However, there remains the perception that cementless total knee arthroplasty are inferior to cemented TKA. This review discusses the longer-term survivorship data for recent systems, which has shown the potential advantages of cementless fixation.","270":"Median sternotomy is the most common access for cardiac surgery. Deep surgical wound infection (DSWI) and mediastinitis after median sternotomy remain significant clinical problems after cardiac surgery in terms of mortality, morbidity and healthcare-associated costs. Despite recent advances in medical management and consensus papers, their incidence ranges from 1% to 5%, and the associated mortality ranges from 20% to 50%. Recent studies in this field are providing excellent outcomes with promising results for the near future. The choice of sternal closure technique plays a crucial role in the prevention of DSWI and mediastinitis and should be tailored to the patient's characteristics, as clinical judgement and experience play a pivotal role. Early aggressive surgical debridement, vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy, muscle flap and newer technologies are revolutionizing the paradigm of treatment of DSWI. Also, recent advances in tissue engineering have been refining potential approaches to tissue regeneration or substitution for enhanced wound repair. This editorial aims to briefly summarize the current and future techniques in DSWI prevention and treatment after cardiac surgery.","271":"Chronic pain still occurs in 10-12% of patients who undergo surgical groin hernia repair. Considering the high prevalence of this pathology, we performed a single-center prospective study comparing the laparoscopic trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) approach to the standard surgical open technique for primary uncomplicated hernia repair. A prospective cohort of 278 patients was extracted from our dataset: 121 received a laparoscopic TAPP approach, and 157 were treated by the Lichtenstein technique in case of inguinal hernia or by the deployment of a polypropylene plug in case of femoral hernia. Both groups were followed-up for 3 years. A significant difference in haematoma\/seroma collection was found (P=0.001) among the groups. Wound infection (P=0.001) and pain perception in the perioperative and early post-operative period were significantly reduced in the TAPP group (P=0.0023 and P&lt;0.0021, respectively). Chronic discomfort at 3-year follow-up was higher in the open approach (P=0.0044), while operative time was marginally shorter compared to TAPP (P =0.002). The incidence of chronic pain and the overall complication rate were significantly lower with the TAPP approach. Based on our findings, the TAPP approach deserves to be considered as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated single-site primary hernia surgery. Further studies with a larger sample will be needed to confirm these preliminary data. ","272":"Imaging studies for preoperative planning of total hip arthroplasty (THA) are typically obtained by two-dimensional (2D) anteroposterior radiographs. However, CT imaging has proven to be a valuable tool that may be more accurate than standard radiographs. The purpose of this review was to report on the current literature to assess the utility of CT imaging for preoperative planning of THA. Specifically, we assessed its utility in the evaluation of: 1) hip arthritis; 2) femoral head osteonecrosis; 3) implant size prediction; 4) component alignment; 5) limb length evaluation; and 6) radiation exposure. A literature search was performed using search terms \"computed tomography\", \"radiograph\", \"joint\" \"alignment\", \"hip,\" and \"arthroplasty\". Our initial search returned a total of 562 results. After applying our criteria, 26 studies were included. CT scans were found to be more accurate than radiographs in predicting implant size and alignment preoperatively and provide improved visualization of extraarticular deformities that may be essential to consider when planning a THA. Although radiation is a potential concern, newer imaging protocols have minimized the radiation to levels comparable to x-ray. The current literature suggests that CT has several advantages over radiographs for preoperative planning of THA including more accurate planning of implant size, component alignment, and postoperative leg length. It is also superior to x-ray in identifying extraarticular hip deformities using the minimum effective dose for CT and the minimum scan length required by templating software. The radiation can be reduced to values similar to radiography. ","273":"Although the use of cementless implants in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has increased in recent years, there is still ongoing debate regarding the optimal method of fixation. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the evidence regarding cementless versus cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with regard to: (1) all-cause survivorship and aseptic survivorship; and (2) patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of newer generation TKAs. A systematic review of all reports on cementless TKA published from January 2010 to February 2019 was performed. A total of 221 articles were evaluated and 39 studies met inclusion criteria for final analysis. Metrics evaluated included all-cause survivorship, aseptic survivorship, and Knee Society Scores (KSS). Modern cementless TKA provides excellent survivorship and patient-reported outcomes as compared to cemented designs. Recent studies have demonstrated that newer generation cementless TKAs provide similar functional outcomes and survivorship as compared to cemented TKA. However, additional prospective, randomized trials with long-term follow up are necessary to further compare the outcomes of cementless versus cemented TKA. ","274":"Ventral hernia repair is one of the most common operations performed by surgeons worldwide. The widespread adoption of laparoscopic surgery has significantly reduced complications related to traditional open approaches. The most common approach in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is the intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) approach. This technique, though simple to perform, has limitations, including bridging mesh, intraperitoneal positioning of mesh, transfascial fixation, circumferential mesh fixation, and the use of more expensive composite mesh materials. These limitations are magnified when hernias occur in anatomically difficult sites such as the subxiphoid, suprapubic, and flank regions. Robotic-assisted hernia repair using a transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional IPOM by potentially addressing these limitations. We review the operative considerations, intraoperative approach, and current body of literature related to robotic-assisted TAPP ventral hernia repair and conclude that it is feasible and may result in improved outcomes related to the restoration of abdominal wall anatomy and reduced operative costs. Further studies are needed to assess if robotic-assisted TAPP should become the standard approach for repair of ventral hernia defects.","275":null,"276":null,"277":"While many scientific reports deal with inguinal hernia, including treatment methods and prosthetic devices proposed to provide a cure, few studies have sought to deepen our understanding of the etiology of this disease. The genesis of inguinal protrusion seems to be a neglected subject, even though addressing hernia genesis may be helpful for improving techniques and materials for surgical treatment. To clarify the source of inguinal protrusions, macroscopic and histological alterations of the inferior epigastric vessels in the herniated groin have been studied. These vascular structures exhibit significant features that could help to illuminate hernia genesis. In patients with double ipsilateral inguinal hernia, composed of distinct direct and indirect protrusions, a tissue septum separates the two defects. Macroscopic observation and histological examination of this septal arrangement were carried out in 23 patients to highlight characteristics of the inferior epigastric vessels in the posterior aspect of this anatomical area. The examined inferior epigastric vessels presented notable alterations of the gross anatomy and histologically significant damage, with a typical trait of chronic compressive damage. All degrees of degeneration were observed, including complete disbanding of the vascular structure. In pantaloon hernias, excised inferior epigastric vessels suffered from chronic compressive degeneration but had no contact with the protrusions. Therefore, protrusion expansion does not produce the degenerative injuries seen in the epigastric vessels. In the inguinal area, there is no source of chronic compression except visceral impact. Consequently, orthostatic visceral impact could be hypothesized to cause structural weakening of the groin, leading to tissue disbanding and visceral protrusion through the weakened inguinal floor.

When possible, reconstruction with scapular allograft is the gold standard, and gives satisfactory functional, cosmetic, and oncological outcomes. While good results have recently been reported with 3D-printed prostheses for reconstruction of bone loss, there is little information available in the medical literature regarding scapula reconstruction with a 3D-printed prosthesis. Between 2016 and 2018, we performed four scapular resections (two total and two involving the superior 1\/3) followed by reconstruction with a 3D-printed prosthesis made of a porous titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V, diameter between 100 and 400 mm), using computer-aided design (CAD) and patient-specific implants (PSI) with previously acquired CT-MR fusion images. At 2 years follow-up, the patients with partial scapulectomy had an MSTS score of 76%, no local or systemic recurrence, good clinical results and no pain. At 1 year 6 months follow-up, the patients with total scapulectomy had an MSTS score of 46%, no local or systemic recurrence, fair clinical results and no pain. Thus, custom-made 3D-printed prostheses appear to be valuable in orthopedic surgery. However, a larger cohort and longer-term analysis are needed to evaluate the scapular 3D-printed prosthesis as a reliable reconstruction technique.","280":"The prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been associated with several factors. The aim of the present study was to correlate tumor-related factors and pathological findings with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. From a prospectively maintained database, we reviewed 89 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas in patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy from 2010 to 2014. The impact of histopathologic or tumor-related data, including a lymph node ratio greater than 15% (LNR15), on survival was analyzed. Univariate analysis of DFS and OS showed that vascular resection, pT, pN, LNR15, microvascular, lymphatic, and perineural invasion, and R1 resection influenced survival. Only LNR15, perineural invasion and R1 resection were independent predictors for both DFS (HR 6.39, p = 0.011; HR 8.53, p = 0.003; HR 9.68, p = 0.002, respectively) and OS (HR 4.21, p = 0.039; HR 5.41, p = 0.020; HR 4.41, p = 0.036, respectively). This study demonstrates that LNR15, perineural invasion and R1 resection are independently associated with DFS and OS.

The technological achievements of the past few decades have dramatically improved our ability to diagnose and treat a variety of common issues that affect fertility and menstruation. Procedures that once required the complex milieu of a hospital or outpatient setting-diagnostic hysteroscopy, endometrial ablation, hysteroscopic polypectomy, and myomectomy-are now well within the reach of motivated and well-trained practitioners. The recent changes in physician reimbursement and the ongoing need to contain healthcare spending have motivated many gynecologists to offer an array of office-based procedures. But, the transition from a hospital-based technique to one that can safely and comfortably be performed in an office requires thoughtful planning in the acquisition of equipment, the training of physicians, nurses, and support staff, and the management of pain. Finally, some form of accreditation should be considered not only to comply with state and local healthcare laws but as a means to offer public reassurance that the care provided in an office meets a well-recognized standard. In this second of a two-part series, we will review the current state of OBGS technology and offer training guidelines to facilitate the transition from the outpatient to the office setting. Additionally, we will discuss pain management for OBGS and the role of accreditation. The lead author will review his 40-year journey in performing both simple and complex gynecologic procedures in an office-based surgery (OBS) setting and offer recommendations for achieving proficiency, safety, and comfort in the office environment. Finally, the authors will offer their thoughts on what can be expected in the future of gynecologic office-based surgery.","282":"Progressive saphenous vein graft (SVG) failure remains a key limitation to the long-term success of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). SVG disease after the first year is dominated by intimal hyperplasia, which predisposes the SVG to thrombosis and accelerated atherosclerosis. The objective of this study was to review and summarize the latest experimental and clinical data on the use of mechanical external stents for vein grafts. In January 2020, the PubMed database was searched using the terms \"external stent\", \"CABG\", \"saphenous vein graft\" and \"intimal hyperplasia\". The results were reviewed and only randomized experimental and clinical studies that analyzed the effect of external stenting on venous intimal hyperplasia were included in the analysis, together with studies that investigated the clinical benefit of external stenting. Eight experimental and four clinical trials met the search criteria. Controlled trials in different large animal models concluded that external stenting significantly reduced intimal hyperplasia 3-6 months post implantation, and reduced both thrombosis rates and the development of lumen irregularities. Data from randomized controlled trials with a follow-up period of 1-4.5 years supported the pre-clinical findings and demonstrated that external stents significantly reduced vein graft disease. Strong evidence indicates that supporting the vein with external stents is safe and leads to clear advantages at both the anatomical and cellular levels. With the further accumulation of consistent positive results, external stenting of SVG may become the standard of care in future CABG. ","283":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death due to cancer in the United States and survival is heavily dependent upon the cancer stage at diagnosis. In the treatment of Stage I or Stage II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cancerous lung nodules are removed through lobectomy or segmentectomy. Lobectomy removes an entire lobe of the lung. Segmentectomy removes only a portion of the lobe, minimizing removal of functional lung parenchyma. Both procedures can be completed through video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). In this retrospective review of the outcomes of VATS segmentectomy, the locations of nodules in relation to segmentectomy and the selection of patients to undergo segmentectomy are discussed. A retrospective analysis of 60 patients who underwent VATS segmentectomy from January 2016 to December 2017 was performed. Forty-five patients were selected based on a diagnosis of NSCLC and the availability of reported outcomes. Patients were reviewed over 18 to 42 months for evidence of disease recurrence or progression. The patients had an average age of 71.2 years, and 31 (69%) were former or current smokers. Most of the lung nodules removed were located in the left upper lobe (LUL) and removed by LUL trisegmentectomy. The median lung nodule size was 18 mm. Most of the cancers diagnosed were Stage I adenocarcinoma. The median length of stay in the hospital was 3 days. The median chest tube retention was 2 days. Six patients had nodule recurrence or progression of disease. In decision-making between segmentectomy and lobectomy, adequate margins are required for the selection of segmentectomy, the most common of which is LUL trisegmentectomy. Technical challenges can be overcome with adequate training and simulation. Additional research could focus on the identification of factors associated with recurrence.

A single-center, single-surgeon retrospective chart review on 68 consecutive patients who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction for incisional herniation on the midline between January 2012 and December 2016 is presented. The Bonheiden technique is based on anterior component separation in combination with preperitoneal retromuscular mesh reinforcement of the midline. Data of 68 consecutive cases of incisional midline abdominal wall defects treated electively with the mesh reinforced anterior component separation technique were analyzed. Demographics, patient characteristics, and hernia properties were evaluated. Postoperative complications included 28% of wound infections\/dehiscence, 25% seromas, and 7% hematomas. No recurrences have been seen. We conclude this technique to be safe and reliable for large midline defects in patients suffering with several comorbidities.","288":"Diaphragm dysfunction, which can be due to eventration or an abnormally high-positioned diaphragm, can cause respiratory compromise. Eventration is most commonly due to unilateral diaphragm paralysis, which reduces ventilatory function in adults by about 25%. Since the 1920s, this condition has been treated with diaphragm plication, which itself has evolved to include the use of several different techniques and materials. This review explores the relevant literature on diaphragm plication using sutures or staples for the treatment of eventration to determine if either provides a clinical benefit over the other.","289":null,"290":null,"291":"This paper describes technical difficulties and outcomes for the first 15 patients treated with Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilization (DIS) for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair. The first 15 patients treated with DIS were included. To optimize the inclusion process, a new pre-operative pathway was developed. All intra-operative technical problems were recorded. During the 2-year follow-up period, patient-related outcome measures, return to work, anterior-posterior knee laxity using a Rolimeter and ACL healing as revealed by MRI follow-up scans were recorded. During 11 DIS procedures, 15 technical problems were encountered. Six were surgeon-related and 9 were material-related. All problems were resolved intra-operatively. Repeat surgery was performed in 4 patients due to arthrofibrosis and in 1 due to a cyclops lesion. The DIS implant was removed in all 5 patients. According to the Tegner score, 7 of 10 (70%) patients returned to the pre-injury level of sporting activity within 6 months. The mean return to work time was 5.4 (SD 3.6) weeks. On MRI, 10 patients showed normal ACL healing (Grade 1) and 3 showed a high repair signal intensity (Grade 2). Although 2 patients showed no signs of ACL healing on MRI (Grade 3), no instability was reported or measured post-operatively or after the DIS implant was removed. All intra-operative technical problems were resolved and did not lead to conversion to ACL reconstruction. We share tips and tricks that could assist surgeons who are just starting to use the DIS technique. ","292":"The tibial tubercle-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance is commonly used to evaluate and guide treatment for patellar instability. There is limited data available regarding TT-TG variability based on patient demographics and anthropometric factors. TT-TG was measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for 384 consecutive adult patients. Demographic information for the corresponding was then gathered from the medical record and analyzed. Demographic variables analyzed included age, sex, race, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Mean TT-TG among the 384 patients was 12.68mm (standard deviation [SD]: 4.13mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.26-13.10mm, range, 3.2-27.0mm), and there was a significant correlation with height (p=0.009), weight (p=0.017), and race (p&lt;0.001). However, there was no significant correlation seen with sex (p=0.854), BMI (p=0.253), or age (p=0.096). Height and African American race were identified as independent predictors of increased TT-TG (p=0.007 and p&lt;0.001, respectively); and females were found to have an increased TT-TG relative to height (p=0.015). Tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance was significantly correlated with race and height in the 384 patients examined. These findings may help explain clinical differences in these patients and help establish \"norms\" for patients of various ethnic and anthropometric variability.

Minimally invasive surgery offers clear benefits over open surgery, such as decreased postoperative pain, infection, length of hospital stay, and time out of work. It is now possible to perform many laparoscopic gynecologic surgeries with minimal to no visible scars. This article reviews the use of 3mm ports and several reduced-port and single-port techniques for use in gynecologic surgery as well as vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES). We also discuss the advantages and challenges that physicians face regarding the adoption of these procedures into general practice. Lastly, we present our novel economic adaption in approach to reduced-port laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy versus traditional single-site laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. In conclusion, minimally invasive approaches to gynecological surgery are considered feasible and safe.","294":"The purposes of this study were to create a \"three-plane model\" for laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and to compare short-term outcomes of anterior medial-to-lateral (aM-to-L) and caudal-to-cranial access by retroperitoneal tunneling (Ca-to-Cr), as described based on the three-plane model. A three-plane model was developed to clarify the steps of an operation. Consecutive cases of right colon cancer were operated upon with an aM-to-L approach in the earlier period and then with a Ca-to-Cr approach, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Short-term results were compared. Sixty-two patients were divided into aM-to-L (n=29) and Ca-to-Cr (n=33) groups. The two groups did not differ in terms of the patients' baseline characteristics. Median operative time was 220 min (IQR 190-260) for the aM-to-L group and 222.5 min (IQR 180-255) for the Ca-to-Cr group (p=0.73). Estimated blood loss was similar in both groups (p=0.13). Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (IQR 5-8) in the aM-to-L group and 7 days (IQR 6-9) in the Ca-to-Cr group (p=0.17). Median number of harvested lymph nodes was 45.5 (IQR 25-44.9) in the aM-to-L group and 30 (IQR 18-48.5) in the Ca-to-Cr group (p=0.34).

Manipulations under anesthesia have been considered a surrogate for knee stiffness, an undesired postoperative outcome that can potentially be avoided. Currently, there is a lack of information regarding the impact that these new technologies have on manipulations under anesthesia (MUA) rates following TKA. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate rates of MUAs between a consecutive series of patients who underwent robotic-assisted surgery compared to patients who underwent TKA with conventional instrumentation. A total of 188 consecutive robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasties were performed by five fellowship-trained, high-volume surgeons at academic and community institutions. Patients were paired to a consecutive equal number of control patients by each of the specific surgeon for comparison. All patients followed similar postoperative rehabilitation starting on postoperative day one. Rates of MUAs were evaluated within and between cohorts. Additionally, the percent difference of rates was calculated to compare cohorts. All patients were evaluated at a minimum of two years follow-up time from the index procedure. Chi-square analyses was performed to statistically compare MUA rates between the cohorts. The overall manipulation under anesthesia rate for the study cohort was 1.06% (2\/188 patients), while it was 4.79% in the control cohort (9\/188) (p=0.032). A 127.5% difference in manipulation under anesthesia rates was found between the two cohorts. No individual surgeons had higher MUA rates in their robotic-assisted group. Our study found that patients undergoing robotic-assisted TKA experienced a significant, 4.5-fold decrease in rates of manipulation under anesthesia (p=0.032). Given that MUAs can be a marker of knee stiffness following total knee arthroplasty, the lower rate indicates that study cohort patients had less knee stiffness and, therefore, greater initial postoperative range of motion than the control cohort. Based on these data, assistive technologies may have an advantageous role contributing to enhanced patient outcomes. ","300":"Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty has been demonstrated to help increase various patient-reported, clinical, and surgical outcome metrics (PROMs). However, the current literature is limited regarding PROMs data for longer follow-up periods beyond one year. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1) report multicenter patient-reported outcomes with multiple metrics, as well as 2) postoperative surgeon-specific outcomes at a minimum two-year follow-up. Five fellowship-trained, high-volume surgeons performed a total of 188 total knee arthroplasty surgeries using the enhanced preoperative planning and real-time intraoperative feedback of a robotic-assisted device. Patients from all surgeons followed similar postoperative rehabilitation beginning on postoperative day one. Patients were evaluated based on the Short Form-12 Questionnaire (SF-12), the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), and Knee Society total and subscores (KSS). The SF-12 was subdivided into two components: mental composite score (MCS) and physical composite score (PCS). The KSS was subdivided into functional and knee scores. Additionally, surgical outcomes from the latest follow-up visit were evaluated. All patients were evaluated at a minimum of two years follow-up time. All patients reported excellent postoperative outcomes for all three PROMs. The mean postoperative SF-12 MCS and PCS scores were both 57 points, with 50 as the threshold for norm-based scoring (MCS range: 42 to 69 points; PCS range: 41 to 68 points). The mean FJS was 75 points (range: 14 to 100 points). The mean KSS functional score was 84 points (range: 20 to 100) while the mean Knee Score was 92 points (range: 40 to 100). Similarly, we found that the aseptic revision rates were low (n=2, 1.06%, one for unexplained pain, and another for a post-traumatic tibial fracture) with few other postoperative complications (n=7 patients [3.7%]) in our cohort. Our analysis found that patients had excellent outcomes across multiple PROM metrics. Future work can build on these results with large patient populations over longer follow-up intervals. Nevertheless, these results provide the foundation and evidence to support the continued use of this innovative technology for total knee arthroplasties. ","301":"Single-incision laparoscopy (SIL) was initially reported in the mid-1900's, but remained unpopular until the arrival of Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery. It was described not only for surgery involving the digestive system, but also for breast, thoracic, urologic, gynecologic and pediatric surgery. Various studies have proven its feasibility, safety and effectiveness. This report describes the 10-year experience with SIL of a single surgeon at a single institution. From May 2009 to May 2019, 1700 abdominal SILs were performed, including: cholecystectomy (475), inguinal hernia repair (319), incisional\/ventral hernia repair (293), appendectomy (226), colorectal surgery (158), fundoplication\/diaphragmatic hernia repair (72), gastric surgery (54), diagnostic laparoscopy (42), liver surgery (18), small bowel resection (15), splenectomy (12), adrenalectomy (6), gynecologic surgery (6), pancreatic surgery (2), and urologic surgery (2). Three types of incision\/access-site were adopted. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered. The following outcomes were evaluated: laparoscopic operative time, operative bleeding, supplementary scars or trocars for improved exposure of the operative field and\/or control of perioperative complications, final incision length, hospital stay, postoperative pain during hospitalization and after discharge, early and late access-site complications and other early and late general complications. While there were no conversions to open surgery or conventional laparoscopy, a supplementary millimetric instrument or a 5-mm trocar was needed in 27.8% and 0.5% of cases, respectively. No operative or postoperative mortalities were registered. The mean final incision length was between 13.1 and 21.0 mm at the umbilicus, between 43.3 and 57.2 mm suprapubically, and between 21.4 and 36.3 mm in another abdominal quadrant. Postoperative pain decreased from the first hours until the end of hospitalization. The percentage of patients who required an analgesic drug for more than 5 days after discharge ranged between 0 and 16.6%. The early access-site complication rate was 7.5%, and the access-site incisional hernia rate was 1.3%. The other early general complication rate was 10.7%, and reoperation was required in 1.4%. The other late general complication rate was 0.7%, and reoperation was required in 0.5%. SIL is a laparoscopic technique that can safely be offered to patients presenting abdominal diseases. The main advantages include enhanced cosmetic results and reduced abdominal trauma. The main disadvantages are patient selection, a longer operative time for some procedures, and a need to expose the operative field for some other procedures.

We evaluated 5G performance in two different medical applications (person\/asset track &amp; tracing and video data transmission for telesurgery) to appraise the impact of this new technology. In addition, a Delphi study was conducted evaluating the expectations and acceptance of 5G in the medical field in general. Delphi study revealed that 5G has great potential for the future information transfer in the healthcare domain, and an increase of research activities for 5G applications in hospitals is needed. Clinical evaluation proved technical feasibility and accuracy of the 5G track &amp; trace prototype solution.

Delay time (latency) ranged between 2-60ms depending on the transmitted data packet length. Seventy-five percent of data packets were processed after 30ms. 5G data transmission volume, rate, and latency met the requirements for real-time track &amp; trace and telemedicine applications.

Most of the described techniques attempt to reduce abdominal wall tension by using mesh prosthetics or myofascial release. Although the concept of a \"tension-free\" hernia repair is well-understood and appreciated by surgeons, quantitative information about abdominal wall tension is limited. This review evaluates the published literature related to abdominal wall tension and summarizes how the measurement of intraoperative tension can guide clinical decision-making. Most of the methods and techniques for measuring abdominal wall tension are similar and involve the use of tensiometers. However, there is no accepted standardized technique. Baseline tension measurements confirm the concept of a baseline physiological tension, and it has been observed that tension does not correlate with hernia width. When the tension is considered to be too great during hernia repair, intraoperative techniques such as myofascial release can be used to reduce tension to physiological values. Emerging data from clinical studies on tension have added to our understanding of the mechanics and physiology of the abdominal wall. Standardized devices and measurement techniques need to be developed and validated to foster the utility of tension measurements in hernia repair.","308":"In 1989, we reported the use of the radial artery as a second target conduit for coronary artery bypass grafting. However, underpowered randomized trials have reported differences in clinical outcomes between the radial artery and other grafts. As we approach 50 years of experience with radial artery grafting, we reviewed the literature to determine the second-best target vessel for coronary operations. An electronic review of the literature with an emphasis on randomized controlled trials, propensity-matched observational series, and meta-analyses identified a large population of patients who received arterial conduit and saphenous vein grafts. The radial artery has been proven to be reliable as a second target conduit for coronary artery bypass grafting, with outcomes and patency rates superior to those for saphenous vein graft. It has also been proven to be both safe and effective as a third conduit in the territory of the right coronary artery. A paucity of evidence with few comparable series limits the use of the gastroepiploic artery. In its fifth decade of use, we can definitively conclude that the aorto-to-coronary radial bypass graft is the conduit of choice for coronary operations after the left internal thoracic artery to the left anterior descending artery.

Surgery remains the most important treatment strategy, and many different approaches have been developed. We present here our institutional experience with 68 cases using a transcortical neuronavigation approach with some technical nuances to improve navigation accuracy during resection. The technique and clinical outcomes are discussed, with a specific focus on seizure sequels. Demographic data were collected, along with information on clinical and seizure characteristics at presentation, localization and size of CM, presence of multiple localizations, evidence of recent CM-related bleeding on MRI, intervention features, postoperative complications, prescription of anti-epileptic drugs at discharge and seizure outcome. We assume that surgery through a narrow well-defined working corridor would limit brain exposure and manipulation, and hence could significantly affect not only general complications, but also seizure control. The technique is feasible and associated with relatively low rates of minor and major procedure-related complications. It is also a valid method for surgeons in training since the trajectory is planned preoperatively with a senior consultant and the working corridor always follows the catheter, which directly leads to the cavernoma.","310":"The present review aims to analyze the current information available on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and treatment of vesico-vaginal fistulas (VVF), with particular focus on the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques. Through the use of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, we conducted a literature review of all available studies related to MIS treatment of VVF, focusing on laparoscopic techniques. After abstracts were read to identify pertinent studies, full manuscripts were reviewed by two authors according to the aim of the review. Vesico-vaginal fistula is defined as an abnormal passage that connects the bladder to the vagina and affects over 3 million women worldwide. It can be classified according to its complexity (simple or complex) and mechanism (obstetric-related or iatrogenic). Laparoscopic treatment of VVF started in 1994 and is currently the gold-standard approach for this pathology. No differences in terms of efficacy or safety have been reported between MIS (laparoscopy, robotic-assisted laparoscopy and laparoscopic single-site) using extra-vesical and trans-vesical approaches, with success rates of 80% to 100%, and low rates of conversion (1.9%), recurrence (less than 1%) and intra- or post-operative complications (3%). Surgical principles for fistula repair, described independently by Angioli and Couvelaire, must always be followed. A bladder fill and integrity test with at least 300 mL should be performed before ending surgery, since this increases the success rate by about 6%. Other interventions such as flap interposition, number of layers in closure and expectant management (spontaneous closure with a Foley catheter alone) remain controversial. To date, no differences have been seen among the laparoscopic surgical techniques. The lack of prospective evaluations has hindered a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and the development of evidence-based recommendations regarding diagnosis, management and follow-up. Since no differences were found compared to a trans-vesical approach, extra-vesical repair is recommended to avoid bladder bi-valving.","311":"Total mesorectal excision is the standard radical operation after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with middle\/low locally advanced rectal cancer. However, it carries significant rates of morbidity, sexual\/urinary dysfunction, fecal impairment and permanent stoma. The ability to identify patients with a complete or nearly-complete response could help steer patients to less-invasive surgery or a watch-and-wait strategy. To assess the ability to predict good responders and a favorable prognosis among rectal cancer patients by post-chemoradiation therapy MRI. Consecutive patients stage T3-4N0M0 or T(any)N+M0 located within 10cm from the anal verge were enrolled. Patients were staged and re-staged 8.8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation by digital exam, colonoscopy, pelvic-MRI, and thorax and abdominal CT scans. All patients underwent total mesorectal excision with curative intent. Of the total 309 patients, 275 were eligible, and 199 (72.4%) of these were stage III.

The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the effects of space and microgravity on hip and knee articular cartilage, including its impact on joint mobility and functional status. A review of the current literature was performed utilizing the terms \"joints,\" \"joint mobility,\" \"articular cartilage,\" \"knee,\" \"hip,\" \"space,\" \"microgravity,\" and \"osteoarthritis\" in PubMed and Google Scholar from 1990 to 2018, yielding a total of 1,400 citations following the removal of 500 duplicates. Following screening by eligibility criteria, five reports were included. Dysregulation of osteogenesis and weakened structural integrity of hip and knee cartilage were demonstrated secondary to microgravity. Adequate cartilage repair requires Earth-like conditions as signified by a statistically significant increase in serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein concentrations in astronauts. Reduced loading led to the degradation of knee ligaments and menisci which may pose a risk for subluxation or dislocation. Murine studies demonstrated decreased articular cartilage thickness in the medial femoral condyle and patella as assessed by ultrasound. Additionally, glycosaminoglycan levels in unloaded rats were lower than weight-bearing rats, with a concomitant increase in matrix metalloproteinase-13 protein, degrading collagen. Return to weight-bearing demonstrated partial recovery of cartilaginous degeneration. Space and associated microgravity conditions adversely impact articular cartilage as demonstrated in murine and human studies. The pathogenetic process occurs due to the mechanically responsive nature of cartilage, with an increase in cartilage metabolism in microgravity. There remains a marked paucity of literature regarding the gravitational force necessary for adequate cartilage survival and the impact of space-related radiation on cartilage repair. Additionally, further studies should assess pharmacologic interventions, such as recombinant human fibroblast growth factor to stimulate cartilaginous growth.

Proper surgical technique to obtain appropriate placement of the trocar in the center of the osteonecrosis is sometimes difficult and can require additional radiation exposure until the surgeon is satisfied with the trocar position. This study describes an improvement of this procedure using computer-assisted navigation. A prospective, randomized study was conducted on cadavers using surgical trainees with no experience and one expert surgeon in surgical core decompression. During a training session, 3 novice surgeons underwent a test by performing the surgical task (core decompression) on a cadaver hip using fluoroscopic guidance. These trainee surgeons then placed the Kirschner wire under computer-assisted navigation. Osteonecrosis was defined as a target volume situated on the superior and anterior part of the femoral head. Performance during the tests was evaluated by radiographic analysis of trocar placement and by the measurement of radiation exposure. During the cadaver session, computer-assisted navigation achieved a better match to the ideal position of the trocar, with better trocar placement in terms of the tip-to-subchondral distance and the ideal center position. Computer-assisted navigation was associated with fewer attempts to position the trocar, a shorter duration of fluoroscopy, and decreased radiation exposure compared to surgery performed under conventional fluoroscopy. The findings suggest that computer-assisted navigation may be safely used to train surgical novices in core decompression. This technique avoids the use of both live patients and harmful radiation. For expert surgeons, computer-assisted navigation might improve precision with less radiation, which might be desirable in cell therapy. ","318":"Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair incorporating a prosthetic mesh underlay, first described in 1993, has demonstrated a lower long-term recurrence rate versus open non-mesh repair. However, over the past 25 years, the laparoscopic approach to ventral\/incisional hernias is utilized in only approximately 30% of cases. One of the reasons that prevents it from being utilized more often is the inability to readily, reliably, and easily close the fascial defect. A novel technique has been developed for full-thickness abdominal wall closure in laparoscopic ventral hernioplasty, utilizing puncture sites to place multiple self-locking ligature straps. Introduction of the straps into the abdominal cavity in orthogonal orientation to the skin surface, followed by subcutaneous retrieval of the contralateral tip of the strap, achieves incorporation of full-thickness abdominal wall on either side of the defect. The self-locking property of each strap allows tension to be applied in sequential fashion. Incremental tension application facilitates re-apposition of the borders in large defects. The increased width of the strap compared with conventional suture serves to resolve the force exerted upon tissue during the acute phase of defect closure. The instrumentation was tested in six ventral hernias created in resected porcine belly walls. Subsequent tests were conducted in three swine with large congenital umbilical hernias. One of the test animals was re-examined laparoscopically 30 days post repair, with full healing and no recurrence exhibited upon re-examination. We anticipate that the simplicity and functionality of this technique will translate to clinical utility in the significant cohort of human ventral hernia patients.","319":null,"320":"Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) usually affects patients younger than 50 years and frequently leads to collapse of the femoral head and subsequent osteoarthritis of the hip. Joint-preserving procedures are attempted in the early stages without collapse, while total hip arthroplasty (THA) is done during more advanced stages with femoral head collapse or a fracture in the necrotic portion. Thus, accurate staging of the disease is mandatory to decide therapeutic strategy. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of occult fracture in the necrotic portion among osteonecrotic femoral heads, which were classified as Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) stage 1 or 2 on radiographs. A preoperative computer tomography (CT) scan was routinely performed to obtain an adequate cup position in patients undergoing THA at our institution. Radiographs and CT scans of 308 patients, who underwent unilateral THA due to ONFH from January 2011 to December 2014, were assessed by two orthopedic surgeons to compare the stage based on simple radiography and that based on CT scans. Among the 308 hips, which were classified as stage I or II lesions on simple radiography, fracture inside the necrotic portion was seen in 63 hips (20.5%) on CT scans. Fifty-nine of the 63 patients were followed for two to five years. Further collapse of the femoral head occurred in 41 patients, and 36 of them underwent THA during the follow up. In this study, 20.5% of hips classified as ARCO stage I or II on simple radiography were found to be ARCO stage III on CT imaging. When a joint-preserving treatment is considered for early stage ONFH, CT examination is necessary for more precise staging of the disease. ","321":"Careful surgical technique is a critical component of total hip arthroplasty. Femoral preparation and component positioning are vital to improving outcomes and preventing complications. Femoral preparation begins with creating an entry hole in the proximal femur. Various tools have been used for this purpose which resemble a \"cookie cutter.\" An axial starter reamer, or awl, is then inserted through the entry hole in the proximal femur to aid in opening and centralizing the canal for sequential reaming or broaching. A novel technique was described previously which allows the awl to center itself in the canal with little risk of deviation from midline or cortical perforation. Since describing this technique in 2014, the senior surgeon has further modified the method of preparing the entry hole in the proximal femur. The surgeon now uses a 1\/8\" drill bit to penetrate the piriformis fossa, instead of a \"cookie cutter\" or osteotome. A 1\/8\" entry hole eliminates gaps between the bone and the implant, results in lateralization of the stem, and avoids varus malposition. We evaluated 300 primary hip arthroplasties by a single surgeon using one of the three techniques: traditional clockwise technique (Group 1), our previously published novel counterclockwise technique (Group 2), and our updated novel technique (Group 3). While the deviation from midline of Group 3 did not differ significantly from Group 2, it was significantly less than the deviation from midline of Group 1 (p=00006). This simple updated technique enables the surgeon to avoid potential malalignment during femoral preparation.","322":"Recent advances in device design have resulted in a wide variety of transcatheter treatment options for patients with symptomatic mitral valve disease. Surgery remains the gold standard for patients with symptomatic, primary mitral regurgitation, while transcatheter devices can be considered in higher-risk patients. For secondary mitral regurgitation, optimal medical therapy and cardiac resynchronization are recommended. Recent evidence suggests that transcatheter alternatives may be considered as well. This review will provide an overview of current transcatheter mitral repair and replacement technologies. These include those that mimic open surgical procedures such as edge-to-edge repair, choral replacement, direct annuloplasty, and valve replacement.","323":".","324":null,"325":"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether immediate surgery within 2 hours is a prognostic factor for adverse postoperative outcomes. This was a prospective observational study that included all consecutive patients who underwent emergency and elective colon resection at a tertiary-level hospital for malignant or benign conditions over a 13-month period. Postoperative outcomes included morbidity, mortality, reoperation, readmission and length of stay. The statistical analysis included both univariate and multivariate tests, with statistical significance set at p&lt;0.05. Over a 13-month period, 300 colon resections were performed. Twenty-five cases (8.3%) underwent emergency operations within 2 hours of admission. Immediate surgery was associated with worse postoperative outcomes including higher mortality and reoperation rates: 40% versus 5.8% (p &lt;0.0001, OR: 10.79, 95% CI: 4.18-27.79) and 20% versus 6.9% (p=0.02, OR: 3.36, 95% CI: 1.19-9.97), respectively. Postoperative outcomes were also worse in operations for malignant tumors (OR: 6.97, 95% CI: 2.82-17.60, p&lt; 0.0001). Immediate colon surgery within 2 hours is a negative predictor for morbidity and mortality. ","326":null,"327":"Aseptic loosening and infection are two of the leading causes of revision in total knee arthroplasty. While several patient-related factors can play a role in the development of these complications, there are certain modifiable surgeon factors that can help mitigate the risk. Intraoperatively, this can begin with the curing process of bone cement which is broken down into four different stages: mixing, waiting, working, and setting. Understanding each stage of the process is beneficial in obtaining successful long-term outcomes. Developing optimal bone-cement penetration is of utmost importance in establishing a strong interface. Proper penetration of cement is dependent on multiple factors including the cement's properties along with its application to the prosthesis and bone surfaces. Combinations of different cement application techniques have yielded results with varying bone-cement interface strength. While a proper cementation technique is critical to the long-term success of a total knee replacement, other factors, such as antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC), can help prevent and treat complications (such as infection). Although ALBC was not approved in North America by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) until 2003, it was first described in 1970 and has been routinely used in revision total knee arthroplasty with reliable antibiotic elution properties and an acceptable safety profile.","328":"Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR\/AR) has been used in surgery for several decades. Over the past 5-10 years, however, new technological advances, including high-resolution screens, mobile graphical processing units (mGPUs) and position-sensing technologies, have been incorporated into relatively low-cost VR and AR devices. This review focuses on the current impact of the application of these \"Phase 2\" VR\/AR technology in surgical training. A narrative literature review was undertaken using PubMed and Web of Science to identify comparative studies related to the impact of Phase 2 VR or AR tools on surgical training, defined in terms of the acquisition of technical surgical skills. Eleven studies on the effectiveness of VR\/AR in surgical education were identified for full review. Further, the grey literature was searched for articles describing the current state of VR\/AR in surgical education. A quality analysis using the Newcastle Ottawa scale showed a median score of 7 (out of a maximum achievable score of 9). All studies showed a positive association between the use of VR\/AR in surgical training and skill acquisition in terms of improving the speed of acquisition of surgical skills, the surgeon's ability to multitask, the ability to perform a procedure accurately, hand-eye coordination and bimanual operation. The grey literature presented a common, positive theme of the benefits of VR\/AR in surgical training. Based on the limited evidence available, VR\/AR appears to have positive training benefits in improving the speed of acquisition of surgical skills. However, the significant heterogeneity in study methodology and the relative recency of wider VR\/AR adoption in surgical training mean that only tentative conclusions can be drawn at this stage. Further research, ideally with large sample sizes, robust outcome measures and longer follow-up periods, is recommended. ","329":"Comprehensive wound management programs that employ a standardized integrated care bundle (ICB) and advanced wound dressings are generally recognized to decrease healing times and treatment costs. The purpose of this study was to compare wound healing rates and cost efficiencies as measured by nursing-care requirements for patients not on an ICB versus patients on an ICB and using a gentian violet\/methylene blue-impregnated (GV\/MB) antimicrobial advanced wound dressing. The comprehensive wound management programs enabled continuous, standardized measurement of each patient's wound episode from admission with a wound to healing and discharge. Data was recorded over 24 months from 2016 to 2018. The variables recorded for each patient included: wound healing time (number of weeks), wound acuity based on the Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT), a comorbidity index (using the Charlson Comorbidity Index), and the number of wound dressing changes. The wound dressing changes required a visit by a registered nurse and, therefore, served as an indicator of care delivery costs where the dressing change visit cost was $68 (CAD). A total of 6300 patients (25% of the total study population) were identified as using GV\/MB dressings within the context of an ICB. The mean healing time for these patients was accelerated more than 50% versus patients not on an ICB. The average total cost of patient care was reduced by more than 75% from diagnosis to wound healing when patients were on an ICB with GV\/MB dressings. These results compared well to patients on ICBs that had other types of advanced dressings. The study demonstrates that a comprehensive wound management program based on integrated care bundles in conjunction with GV\/MB dressings can be a highly-effective clinical option. The benefits showed significant reductions in healing times and treatment costs. ","330":"Dressing is an essential element of standard wound care. The main purpose of wound dressing is: a) provide a temporary protective physical barrier, b) absorb wound drainage, and c) provide the moisture necessary to optimize re-epithelialization. The choice of dressing depends on the anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of the wound. Contemporary wound dressings provide additional benefits, such as antimicrobial properties and pain relief. In this concise review, we discuss the principles of wound dressing, highlight the features of basic and advanced types of dressings, and offer some practical tips on the choice and application of dressings.","331":"The gynecologist's office was, historically speaking, the original setting for surgical practice. In 1809, Ephraim McDowell performed the first ovariotomy and removed a 22.5-pound tumor from Jane Crawford in his Danville, Kentucky office-decades before the development of anesthesia or the aseptic technique. Three developments-introduction of surgical anesthesia, improved operative techniques, and the evolution of the medical-economic environment-shaped surgical practice for over two centuries. The latter part of the 20th century also brought two dramatic changes that affected gynecologic practice. The first included social changes which created a demand for legalized abortion and elective sterilization. The second was a cascade of technological growth and innovations that created the field of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery (MIGS), allowing many procedures to be transferred from the hospital to the outpatient setting and then to the office. With the increasing demand for patient-centered care, effective operating room utilization, and the efficient use of physicians' time, many gynecologic procedures are now being performed in an office-based setting. But, at least three important obstacles remain: the need for widespread accreditation, the availability of teaching in an office-based environment, and meeting the ethical obligation for adequate analgesia and sedation in an office environment.","332":"The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether double-barreled wet colostomy (DBWC) provides similar urinary tract infection rates as separate urinary and fecal diversion (SUFD) in patients undergoing pelvic exenteration. The MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were systematically searched by two independent researchers. The primary endpoint was the urinary tract infection rate. The Mantel-Haenszel method with odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (OR (95%CI)) was used as an effect measure for dichotomous variables. A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity among effect estimates was evaluated using I2 and Tau2. Three observational studies that included a total of 257 patients (159 DBWC; 98 SUFD) were included after 14 potentially eligible records were screened. Pooled urinary tract infection rates were 1.9% (3\/159) in DBWC and 6.1% (6\/98) in SUFD. This difference was not statistically significant [OR (95%CI) = 0.27 (0.06, 1.19); p=0.08] with low among-study heterogeneity (I2=0%). This meta-analysis did not find a significant difference in urinary tract infection rates between DBWC and SUFD in patients undergoing total pelvic exenteration. Further clinical studies will be required to further understand the pros and cons of these procedures. ","333":null,"334":"The aim of this technical note is to describe a surgical technique to repair parastomal hernias with component separation and mesh at reversal of loop ileostomy. Stage III rectal cancer patients who have completed neoadjuvant chemoradiation will undergo low anterior resection with loop ileostomy. Following completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the ileostomy will be reversed after an average of five to six months. A minority of patients presenting with an obstructed rectal cancer may undergo laparoscopic loop ileostomy prior to commencing neoadjuvant chemoradiation, resulting in a longer ileostomy time. Loop ileostomy reversal consists of five steps: mobilization of the stoma, side-to-side anastomosis, component separation, placement of biologic mesh, and purse-string skin closure. The surgical technique described here, consisting of component separation and mesh at loop ileostomy reversal, is effective for repairing parastomal hernia. ","335":"Endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease has recently become more important due to its minimally invasive nature. Elderly patients as well as fragile patients, like diabetics and those with end-stage renal disease, can benefit from this low-morbidity\/-mortality treatment. Very successful results have been achieved with percutaneous balloon angioplasty and stenting in the superficial femoral and iliac arteries. In some areas, however, such as the common femoral artery and the popliteal artery, vascular physicians remain somewhat reluctant to use endovascular strategies. Common femoral endarterectomy, the most often used technique for treatment of common femoral artery lesions, has shown very good long-term results, but is associated with relatively high complication rates, such as superficial and deep wound problems and lymph leakage. This article describes less-invasive endovascular alternatives, such as atherectomy, drug-coated balloons and stenting, and their results. The popliteal artery is also difficult to treat in an endovascular manner due to biomechanical forces during bending and stretching of the knee or leg. Thus, we also describe currently available minimally invasive treatment options for the popliteal artery.","336":"Aneurysmal bone cyst is a rare lesion that is most often found in young adults and children. It can have an unpredictable behavior, with a high recurrence rate after treatment. Treatment is based on personal and institutional experience and preferences. Standard treatment consists of curettage (manual + motorized high-speed burr) plus local adjuvants and bone grafting to fill the void. In anatomical locations that are difficult to reach surgically, percutaneous procedures (injection of sclerosant agents, radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFTA)) or selective arterial embolization (SAE) are used. Medical management with bisphosphonates (BPs) or denosumab has also been advocated. Minimally invasive surgical procedures such as \"curopsy\" and percutaneous demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and\/or autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMC) grafting have also been proposed. SAE is used as a pre-operative procedure to reduce intra-operative bleeding in the case of large lesions and as primary treatment for spinal lesions. The purpose of this review is to present currently available options for the management of aneurysmal bone cyst.","337":"Due to its decreased recovery time and increased patient satisfaction, laparoscopic surgery has witnessed an exponential rise in the last decade. In fact, the indications for laparoscopic surgery are currently numerous and involve multiple disciplines, including gastro-intestinal and gynecological surgery. With this boom, there is much focus on decreasing the rate of complications due to laparoscopy. This includes, but is not limited to, an increased interest in decreasing the risk of port-site herniation by ensuring proper closure of the abdominal wall at the site of port-insertion.","338":"This is the third and final part of our update on the latest advances in cardiac valvular replacement. Part 1 was dedicated to cardiac valvular replacement, and Part 2 focused on transcatheter cardiac valvular treatment. This part concerns annuloplasty prostheses for valvular reconstructive surgery. The number of patients undergoing surgical heart valve repair has been increasing, particularly in high-volume centers. Annuloplasty is now considered the gold standard in mitral valve regurgitation repair secondary to degenerative, ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy disease. The techniques of mitral valve reconstruction have been well established, but controversies remain regarding the type of annuloplasty ring to be used. The available annuloplasty rings include rigid, flexible, complete, partial, and semi-rigid\/flexible. The choice of annuloplasty ring has been the focus of extensive investigation and debate, but to date it still largely remains a matter of \"surgeon's preference\" rather than an evidence-based selection. Functional tricuspid regurgitation was traditionally treated by the classic De Vega annuloplasty, but has since evolved after the development of prosthetic tricuspid annuloplasty. Head-to-head comparisons have demonstrated superior long-term outcomes with device-based annuloplasty compared to suture-based surgery, but the type of ring to be used (flexible versus rigid) has recently been questioned, without reaching definitive conclusions. In contrast to mitral and tricuspid valve repair, aortic repair is more difficult with respect to specific valve features. Annuloplasty is considered to play a key role in controlling aortic regurgitation and preventing recurrence after valve repair. Various modifications of annuloplasty have been advocated (internal\/external, with\/without ring (suture), rigid\/flexible ring). but none of them has become a de facto standard. This paper describes the various rings that are available to help orient surgeons and to serve as a reference for students.","339":null,"340":"The current value-driven healthcare system encourages physicians to continuously optimize the value of the services they provide. Relative value units (RVUs) serve as the basis of a reimbursement model linking the concept that as the effort and value of services provided to patient's increases, physician reimbursement should increase proportionately. Spine surgery is particularly affected by these factors as there are multiple ways to achieve similar outcomes, some of which require more time, effort, and risk. Specifically, as the trend of spinal interbody fusion has increased over the past decade, the optimal approach to use-posterior versus anterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF vs. ALIF)-has been a source of controversy. Due to potential discrepancies in effort, one factor to consider is the correlation between RVUs and the time needed to perform a procedure. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare: 1) mean RVUs; 2) mean operative time; and 3) mean RVUs per unit of time between PLIF and ALIF with the utilization of a national surgical database. We also performed an individual surgeon cost benefit analysis for performing PLIF versus ALIF. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database was utilized to identify 6,834 patients who underwent PLIF (CPT code: 22630) and 6,985 patients who underwent ALIF (CPT code: 22558) between 2008 and 2015. The mean operative times (in minutes), mean RVUs, and RVUs per minute were calculated and compared using the Student's t-tests. In addition, the reimbursement amount (in dollars) per minute, case, day, and year for an individual surgeon performing PLIF versus ALIF were also calculated and compared. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical significance. Compared to ALIF cases, PLIF cases had longer mean operative times (203 vs. 212 minutes, p&lt;0.001). However, PLIF cases were assigned lower mean RVUs than ALIF cases (22.08 vs. 23.52, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, PLIF had a lower mean RVU\/minutes than ALIF cases (0.126 vs. 0.154, p&lt;0.001). The reimbursement amounts calculated for PLIF versus ALIF were: $4.52 versus $5.53 per minute, $958.66 versus $1,121.95 per case, and $2,875.98 versus $3,365.86 per day. The annual cost difference was $78,380.92. The data from this study indicates a potentially greater annual compensation of nearly $80,000 for performing ALIF as opposed to PLIF due to a higher \"hourly rate\" for ALIF as is noted by the significantly greater RVU per minute (0.154 vs. 0.126 RVU\/minutes). These results can be used by spine surgeons to design more appropriate compensation effective practices while still providing quality care. ","341":"The prevalence of obesity has increased, achieving an epidemic status. Obesity has surgical and medical implications on the health of a woman. A minimally invasive surgical approach has several advantages and is considered the preferred approach for various procedures in obese women. The spectrum of gynaecologic surgical care spans over three main domains: benign gynaecologic surgery, reconstructive pelvic surgery, and gynaecologic cancer surgery. In this viewpoint, we chose a signature procedure for each main domain to compare minimally invasive surgery (MIS) trends for obese patients across all domains. Discrepancy was found in minimally invasive surgical trends for obese patients across different gynaecologic surgical domains. Fellowship training or maintaining high surgical volume might help to bridge this gap in the domain of benign gynaecologic surgery and improve quality care offered to obese patients.","342":"A relationship between the extent of resection (EOR) and survival has been demonstrated in patients with glioblastomas (GBMs). However, despite gross total resection (GTR) of the enhancing nodule (EN), GBMs usually relapse, generally near the surgical cavity. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic role of FLAIR resection of GBMs by analyzing pre- and post-operative MRIs to estimate the EOR of EN, FLAIR-hyperintense regions and total tumor volume (TTV). Radiologic and clinical outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. Pre- and post-operative EN volume, pre- and postoperative FLAIR volume (POFV), and pre- and postoperative TTV were analyzed. EOR was then calculated for each component. Time-dependent ROC curves and cut-off values for pre- and post-operative volumes and EOR were calculated. A Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis were then used to analyze progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We did not find any correlation between EOR of FLAIR-altered regions and patient survival. On the other hand, there were statistically significant relationships between the prognosis and both a preoperative EN volume less than 31.35 cm3 (p=0.032) and a postoperative EN volume less than 0.57 cm3 (p=0.015). Moreover, an EOR of EN greater than 96% was significantly associated with the prognosis (p=0.0051 for OS and p=0.022 for PFS). Our retrospective, multi-center study suggests that survival in patients with GBM is not affected by the extent of resection of FLAIR-hyperintense areas.

Repair with Internal Brace Ligament Augmentation (IBLA) is a new technique that uses ultra-high strength tape (FiberTape, Arthrex, Naples, FL, USA) to bridge the ligament. This technique reinforces the ligament as a secondary stabiliser, encouraging natural healing of the ligament by protecting it during the healing phase and supporting early mobilisation. This retrospective case report focuses on the rehabilitation of a 21-year-old male professional soccer player who ruptured his ACL in a contact injury whilst playing a competitive game. He underwent ACL repair with IBLA two weeks following injury. The six-month rehabilitation programme consisted of gradual progressions for mobility, proprioception, strengthening, cardiovascular maintenance and running in conjunction with physiotherapy to assist with the maintenance of soft tissue quality, pain management and control of oedema. After completing the rehabilitation programme, the patient returned to unrestricted sporting activity within six months. At 18-month follow-up, the patient continues to play at the same competitive level without any issues. This rehabilitation programme after ACL repair with IBLA successfully enabled a professional soccer player to return to his pre-injury playing level.

Group 1 consisted of 25 patients with Type I (mild) dural tear who were treated with either tissue-glue-coated collagen sponge or fibrin glue. Group 2 consisted of 26 patients with Type II (moderate) dural tear who were treated with both tissue-glue-coated collagen sponge and fibrin glue. Group 3 consisted of 21 patients with Type III (severe) dural tear who were treated with polypropylene suture along with tissue-glue-coated collagen sponge and\/or fibrin glue. Evident postoperative internal or external CSF leak was used to determine the patient's postoperative result. Postoperative internal or external CSF leak was not evident during a minimum 1-year follow-up in Group 1. In contrast, internal CSF leak was evident in both Groups 2 (n=3) and 3 (n=3) during the same follow-up. No external CSF leak was noted in any of the patients. Three patients underwent re-do spinal surgery for CSF leak repair. Patients in all groups satisfactorily avoided CSF leak. According to the intraoperative findings of a distinct dural tear, patients can be treated adequately with a specific surgical technique.","348":"Since arthritis of the knee is one of the most common pathologies in industrialized nations, there has been a growing interest in fast-track total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, while one of the main concerns is the role of a tourniquet, the available data are inconclusive. This study sought to assess the link between postoperative outcomes and use of a tourniquet in TKA. Our goal was to determine whether it is justified to forego tourniquet use as indicated by the fast-track concept. The participants (n = 108) in this retrospective, non-randomized study were assigned into two groups after they satisfied the inclusion criteria: primary gonarthrosis or secondary gonarthrosis without previous arthrotomy. TKA was performed without (Group I, n = 55) or with (Group II, n = 53) a tourniquet. The postoperative outcome was evaluated in terms of postoperative pain, based on a numeric rating scale (NRS) and the need for pain medication, and postoperative function, based on range of motion (ROM) and walking tests. Overall, no significant correlations were observed between tourniquet use and postoperative pain according to the NRS. Group I required less oxycodone, but more non-opioids. There was no significant difference in the improvement in pre- to postoperative ROM with regard to tourniquet use. The final walking distance was significantly longer in Group I. These results suggest that there is no strongly significant link between the postoperative outcome and the use of a tourniquet. However, further studies will be needed to determine whether a tourniquet may have some other impact on TKA.

In this article, we present D3 extended mesenterectomy: a surgical technique that excises the lymphatic tissue en bloc with the right colectomy specimen. A 3D map of the mesentery of the right colon was reconstructed from staging CT-angiogram scans. The surgical technique of right colectomy with D3 extended mesenterectomy consisted of eight steps: 1) reveal the SMV and SMA; 2) isolate the ileocolic artery; 3) isolate the middle colic artery; 4) resolve the anterior mesenteric flap; 5) specimen de-vascularization; 6) colectomy; 7) resolve the posterior mesenteric flap; and 8) anastomosis. One-hundred-seventy-six patients (77 men) 66 years of age were operated upon from February 2011 to January 2017. There were 169 adenocarcinomas: 16.0% Stage I, 49.1% Stage II, 33.7% Stage III, 1.2% Stage IV. Tumor locations were 50.6% cecum, 41.5% ascending colon, 4.5% hepatic flexure, and 2.3% transverse colon. Mean operating time was 200 minutes, blood loss 273 ml, and length of stay 7.9 days. There were 9 anastomotic leakages and 15 reoperations. One patient underwent small bowel resection due to SMA tear. There was no postoperative mortality. The mean number of lymph nodes per specimen (40.9) was comprised of 27.1 in the D2 volume and 13.8 in the D3 volume. The mean number of metastatic lymph nodes was 1.2 in the D2 volume and 0.13 in D3. There were 7 patients with lymph node metastasis in D3, 2 of whom had node metastasis solely within D3. This study shows that 1.2% of patients would have been incorrectly diagnosed as Stage II if extended D3 mesenterectomy had not been performed. Similarly, lymph node metastases would have been left behind in 4.1% of patients if extended D3 mesenterectomy had not been performed. ","351":"Due to the rising concern regarding excessive opioid use, several alternative pain control options have been developed for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Therefore, the purpose of this article was to review non-narcotic treatments to manage pain after TKA. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) acetaminophen; 2) cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) inhibitors; 3) gabapentinoids; 4) dexmedetomidine, 5) nerve blocks; 6) local analgesic infiltration; 7) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS); and 8) perioperative bracing. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed and EBSCO host electronic databases. All available studies between 1998 and 2018 were evaluated. Searches were performed using the following terms: total knee arthroplasty (title), acetaminophen (title), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (title), gabapentinoids (title), nerve blocks (title), local analgesic infiltration (title), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (title), knee (title), postoperative outcome (title), opioids (title), analgesics (title), alternative (title), heroin (title), chronic pain (title), opioid overdose (title), and cost (title). After full-text analysis of 273 reports that satisfied the search criteria, 58 studies were included in this review. There is conflicting evidence on acetaminophen and gabapentinoids, with some studies reporting opioid use reduction with their use; whereas, others found no difference. Cox-2 inhibitors can potentially reduce opioid requirements and improve pain scores following TKA; however, they are associated with several side effects. Dexmedetomidine has been associated with reduced postoperative opioid consumption, but it has limited applications as it is associated with several major side effects. Neuraxial anesthesia can potentially help control postoperative pain; however, there is a limited effective window and identifying the specific nerve can be challenging. Local infiltrating analgesia have been found to help relieve pain in the early postoperative period. Multiple studies have identified substantial reductions in pain with knee braces. The non-invasive and non-pharmacologic nature of this treatment option makes it very safe and effective for the generalized TKA population. The optimal solution for postoperative TKA pain management has yet to be determined. Although several options exist, many of them have been associated with adverse effects limiting their generalizability. Knee braces, however, have been identified as one potentially successful option. Importantly, knee braces are safe for the majority of patients and should be widely recommended for patient use. ","352":"Ankle osteoarthritis constitutes a large burden to society and is a leading cause of chronic disability in the United States. Most commonly, it is post-traumatic, occurs in younger individuals, and is associated with obesity. This entity presents similarly to osteoarthritis of the other joints, with the typical nonspecific symptoms of stiffness, swelling, and pain. Radiographic investigation includes four weight-bearing standard views: antero-posterior and lateral foot, mortise view of the ankle, and a specialized view of the hindfoot. In this review, we covered epidemiology, anatomy and biomechanics, etiology, pathology, differential diagnoses, symptoms, physical examination, appropriate radiological investigation, as well as current treatment options and algorithms. Non-operative treatment options include weight loss, physical therapy, bracing, orthoses, pharmacologic treatments, corticosteroid injections, viscosupplementation, and biologic modalities. Viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid has the most evidence-based support and has been shown to be safe and efficacious. For patients who have moderate to severe disease, surgery may be indicated. However, current surgical options are either associated with high rates of complications or restrict ankle range of motion (ROM). Early stages of the ankle osteoarthritis should be treated with the above-mentioned non-surgical methods, and once the disease progresses, surgical options can be utilized.","353":"Interscalene brachial plexus nerve blocks (ISBPNBs) are commonly used to mitigate postsurgical pain after shoulder surgery. We performed a prospective observational study in 57 consecutive adult patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery with an ultrasound-guided ISBPNB using liposomal bupivacaine (LB; 133mg\/10ml) mixed with 0.5% bupivacaine (10ml). All patients received prescriptions for 1000mg of oral acetaminophen and 10 5mg oxycodone tablets upon discharge. Post-discharge telephone surveys revealed that mean (standard deviation [SD]) patient-reported motor and sensory recovery times after surgery were 26.8 (3.2) and 34.0 (3.6) hours, respectively. The average (SD) visual analog scale pain score was 5.1 (3.1) at day two post-surgery. The estimated opioid utilization rate at day seven post-surgery was 21% of the prescribed opioid tablets. Our real-world observational findings suggest that multimodal postsurgical pain control using single-shot, ultrasound-guided ISBPNB with LB and postsurgical acetaminophen provides favorable pain control and limited need for postsurgical opioid rescue for seven days after shoulder surgery.

Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the outcome of using the center-center technique via the direct anterior approach. Consecutive elective primary total hip arthroplasties performed using the center-center technique were retrospectively reviewed from May 2015 to February 2017. All cases were performed by a single surgeon at a high-volume, large academic center. The technique focuses on central alignment of the implant on both anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. Standardized objective radiographic measurements were taken at the first two-week follow-up visit to determine the fit and fill at the proximal and distal anatomic segments. Subsidence was measured by comparing the implant position at final follow up to the initial two-week postoperative visit. Other complications: intra- or postoperative fracture, infection, revision, and patient-reported thigh pain were further assessed. Functional postoperative outcomes were assessed using the Harris Hip Score (HHS). A total of 138 patients with a mean age of 65 years and average follow up of 2.8 years were assessed. The mean postoperative HHS was 90 points (59-100). Mean implant subsidence was 1mm. A total of 90% (124) of implants had acceptable radiographic fit and fill in both proximal and distal segments. A majority 74% (102) of implants subsided less than 1mm, and 91% (126) subsided less than 2mm. One implant had radiographic subsidence of 9mm, which was treated with a shoe lift. There were no intraoperative fractures. One postoperative lateral cortex fracture three weeks after surgery due to mechanical fall was treated conservatively. No patients required revision arthroplasty for any reason or reported postoperative thigh pain. The center-center technique can be used to consistently aid in proper femoral stem placement in both coronal and sagittal planes. Optimal fit and fill can be achieved safely using this technique. ","359":"Acetabular bone loss is common during revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). A new acetabular shell was developed with a goal of maintaining native hip center-of-rotation (COR) while achieving good fixation with standard instrumentation and technique. Previous radiographic studies have demonstrated the efficacy of this shell in lowering hip COR. In this case series, we demonstrate the use of this shell in patients undergoing difficult revision THAs. Based on these cases, we have presented how this offset COR acetabular shell may help bring down the hip COR in patients who undergo revision total hip arthroplasty with severe bone loss.","360":"To compare surgical, functional and early survival outcomes for robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder (ONB) reconstruction in patients age = 75 y to those in patients age &lt; 75 y using Propensity Score Matching. We collected data from 15 patients age = 75 y from among 60 consecutive RARC with ONB reconstruction performed at our institution from January 2015 to July 2018. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon after modular training under the supervision of a skilled surgeon. Demographic, surgical, functional and survival data were prospectively collected and compared to the corresponding data from 15 patients from the same series age &lt; 75 y, matched according to the ASA score, body mass index, clinical stage and associated carcinoma in situ using Propensity Score Matching. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative parameters, such as ASA score, BMI and preoperative stage. The same homogeneity was found for intraoperative parameters, such as operation time, number of nodes retrieved and ONB time. The only statistically significant difference noted was in the percentage of nerve-sparing procedures, which was higher in the younger patient group (p &lt; 0.001). The percentages of early and late postoperative complications were higher in the older patients, but the differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, there were no differences among the two populations in terms of functional outcomes (daytime and nighttime continence, potency), or in either cancer-specific or overall mortality. RARC with totally intracorporeal ONB diversion can be offered to older patients with an expectation of good surgical, functional and early survival outcomes, although further studies with a larger sample size will be needed to confirm these results. ","361":"Tricuspid valve regurgitation is generally functional in nature due to right-sided dysfunction in the setting of left-sided concomitant cardiac disease or pulmonary hypertension. Patients living with tricuspid regurgitation often experience numerous limitations as a result of right-sided heart failure symptoms. Patients with significant tricuspid disease, whether native, repaired, or replaced valve, often present with significant symptoms but may not be ideal candidates for operation or, eventually, reoperation. Transcatheter techniques to either repair or replace the tricuspid valve are a burgeoning frontier in structural cardiac interventions. Anatomical challenges include the large and asymmetrical annulus, paucity of calcification, adjacency of the right coronary artery system, and fragility of the valve tissue. Current approaches under investigation in feasibility and early phase clinical trials include edge-to-edge repair, coaptation enhancement, annuloplasty, heterotopic caval valve implantation, and percutaneous tricuspid valve replacement. Although there are limitations to the currently available transcatheter options for the patients, the initial data demonstrate the relative safety of using existing devices with good results and functional improvement. Hopefully, the emerging interest into interventional therapy of tricuspid valve disease will bring back the \"forgotten valve\" into the conscience of the cardiological and surgical community. This review intends to summarize the current strategies and evidences in transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention and enlightening new avenues for future clinical studies.","362":"The impact of specific interventions at resection with primary anastomosis (PRA) for perforated diverticulitis with peritonitis is controversial. The aim of this pooled analysis was to determine whether any specific interventions performed at resection with primary anastomosis in patients with perforated diverticulitis with peritonitis influenced the outcomes.","363":"Needlescopic cholecystectomy (NC) was introduced in the late 1990s. It uses a reduced trocar caliber in an otherwise standard four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and seeks to achieve \"scarless\" surgery without compromising patient safety. Between May 2016 and November 2017, 29 patients underwent elective NC at the Department of General Surgery of Sant'Andrea Hospital (La Spezia, Italy). Inclusion criteria were female sex, age between 18 and 45 years, good performance status (ASA 1-2) and BMI lower than 25. Twenty-one patients underwent a standard 4-port technique: 12mm port in the supraumbilical area, 5mm port in the subxiphoid position, 3mm port in the mid-epigastric area and another 3 mm port in the right mid-clavicular position. In 8 patients, 3mm ports were replaced by 2mm angiocath. A Critical View of Safety (CVS) was achieved in all procedures. Intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) via the cystic duct before any transection of the structures was routinely performed in selected cases, such as those with an unclear biliary anatomy or risk factors for main-duct stones. In our institution, laparoscopic transcystic common bile duct (CBD) exploration is routinely performed in CBD lithiasis. The mean operative time was 66.79 min (range 25-120 min). IOC was performed in 12 patients (41.4%) with suspected choledocolythiasis. There was no conversion to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy or open cholecystectomy. The mean hospital stay was 1.48 days (1-7 days). A Clavien-Dindo IIIB complication occurred in one patient on the third postoperative day. The mean VAS pain score was 3 (0-7). Closure of the skin with primary intention was achieved in all patients. Mean return to work was 6.76 days (3-15 days) and the mean return to previous physical activity was 12.17 days (4-30 days). All of the patients completed the Scar Satisfaction Questionnaire: 26 (89.7% ) and 3 patients (10.3%) were very satisfied and satisfied, respectively. Any effort to reduce invasiveness and improve cosmesis must not jeopardize safety. Our case series demonstrates that needlescopy can be safely associated with intraoperative cholangiography to recognize CBD stones. This technique offers the advantage of minor postoperative pain, better cosmesis results, early return to routine life activities and great satisfaction for the patient. Needlescopy is a valuable and safe alternative that is suitable for elective cholecystectomy in properly selected patients, such as young female patients. ","364":"This study was performed to evaluate the relationships between potential prognostic factors and post-surgery survival in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM). In particular, this study investigated the value of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival. The study participants included 147 patients who underwent resection for CRLM. Demographics, treatments, and relationships between potential prognostic factors and the survival rate were analyzed using a prospective database. The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year cancer-specific survival rates for post-surgery CRLM patients were 94.3%, 71.2%, and 53.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that a positive surgical margin and extrahepatic metastasis were independent negative prognostic factors. The administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to liver surgery did not significantly improve post-surgery outcomes of patients with CRLM. In a subgroup analysis, the time to recurrence in the remnant liver after hepatectomy for CRLM was significantly less in the neoadjuvant group than in the upfront surgery group. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not predictive of cancer-specific survival. The achievement of macroscopically and microscopically negative resection remains the main aim of surgery. ","365":"","366":null,"367":"Thigh pain is a variably reported symptom in the postoperative period following primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with a well-fixed cementless femoral implant. While research has identified stem size, stem alignment, and differences in modulus of elasticity between implant and host bone as potential sources of thigh pain, only one study has specifically examined the impact of variation in implant design within a single femoral stem design. The purpose of this work was to determine whether there were differences in the pain experienced by patients treated with two design variants of a femoral stem during direct anterior THA. Patients undergoing primary direct anterior THA at a single center between 2011-2015 were included in the study. Those patients suffering extensive comorbidities and postoperative complications were excluded from analysis. Study subjects completed a pain drawing and scale questionnaire for the operative hip at least one year following surgery. A cementless, single-taper wedge, titanium femoral component design available in short- and standard-length variations was used in all cases. Pain outcomes were compared between these two femoral stem options. A total of 1347 patients (1536 THA) met inclusion criteria for the study and surveys were returned for 820 of these THAs. Demographic data and UCLA activity scores were similar between cohorts of patients receiving the short- and standard-length components. The most common locations of pain reported were in the lower back and trochanteric region, 28% and 24% respectively. Patients in the short-length cohort reported a significantly lower incidence of pain in the anterior thigh as compared to the standard-length cohort, 12% versus 19% respectively [p=0.007]. There was no difference in the number of patients experiencing moderate to severe intensity of anterior thigh pain between these two groups, 3% versus 5% respectively [p=0.36]. No other statistically significant differences were found in the incidence of pain in the lower back, buttock, groin, trochanter, lateral thigh, or posterior thigh regions between the two cohorts. While the lower back and trochanteric region may be the most frequent areas of pain experienced in patients at one-year or more postoperative from direct anterior THA, a significantly higher incidence of anterior thigh pain is found in those patients treated with a standard-length stem design as compared to the short design. This finding may be due to contact between the tip of the distal stem with the femoral diaphysis as has been theorized in previous research, which is circumvented with the short design variant. ","368":null,"369":"The present review aims to analyze the current data available on the different applications of indocyanine green (ICG) in gynecology. A semantic review of English-language publications was performed by searching for MeSH terms and keywords in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The studies were finally selected by one author according to the aim of this review. ICG is a highly water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye that fluoresces in the NIR spectrum. Approved by the FDA in 1959, it can be administered either IV (usual dose of 5 mg) or locally\/submucosally (usual dose of 5-6.25 mg) according to the pathology or indication. It is used most often in the setting of oncology, endometriosis and other gynecological conditions. In oncological applications, ICG is used to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) using near-infrared light in endometrial, cervical and vulvar cancers. The main advantages that it offers include a reduction of surgical time, improved SLN detection rates, and the ability to avoid radioactivity. In cases of endometrial (submucosal or hysteroscopic applications) or cervical (intracervical administration) cancer, ICG can detect SLN at an accuracy of 95% to 98%. For vulvar cancer, the SLN detection rate can reach 100%. In endometriosis, the lack of good evidence hinders the final evaluation of this method in both diagnostic and therapeutic scenarios. An analytical, well-designed, prospective study is currently underway.","370":"To circumvent the drawbacks of currently available platforms for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and monoport surgery (MPS), we developed a patient-specific, disposable, surgical soft robotic system.

The platform body and the manipulators can be quickly adapted to transmural (monoport), NOTES and endoluminal (endoscopic) applications, and 3D-printed overnight as an individualized system. In addition, practical considerations, such as the predicted \"ideal\" dimensions of the platform, were evaluated. As a result, we found that preoperatively available biometric data currently provide little support for tailored instrument design.

Usually surgical incisions are closed by fixing the edges together. However, in case of significant tissue loss, infected surgical field, or particular cases, wounds may be left open. In recent years, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been widely used for management of various complicated wounds and to support postoperative tissue healing. Another emerging indication for NPWT, applied directly to the closed incisions, is to prevent infections or dehiscences in patients with increased risk of surgical-site complications (iNPWT). Furthermore, the combination of negative pressure with intermittent instillation of solution (NPWTi) seems to be effective in the treatment of a variety of complex wounds. Even if the role of NPWT in promoting wound healing has been largely accepted, there is a lack of evidence (few high-level clinical studies) regarding its effectiveness and further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of action. This article contains a review of recent scientific and clinical research related to indications, contraindications, and mechanisms of action of NPWT to clarify current knowledge, technological evolutions, and future perspectives of devices.","373":"There has been a rapid increase in opioid-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the dangers of excessive opioid use have been observed in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, including those diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. Pain management is an important component of nonoperative treatment in knee osteoarthritis and frequently entails the use of opioids. However, this management technique is not without risks, such as addiction, morbidity, and mortality. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to review the existing literature on the use of opioids in the management of knee osteoarthritis and compare the findings to a new injection management modality. Specifically, we assessed: 1) trends in opioid prescription; 2) patient-reported outcomes; 3) incidence of complications; 4) incidence of abuse and dependence; and 5) mortality related to opioid use in knee osteoarthritis. We then performed a sub-analysis comparing these findings to TG-C, a novel a 3:1 mixture of genetically engineered chondrocytes that has shown promising early phase I, II, and III results. A literature search was performed utilizing the PubMed database with search terms including, but not limited to: \"knee osteoarthritis,\" \"total knee arthroplasty,\" \"opioid,\" \"annual trends,\" \"outcomes,\" \"complications,\" \"dependence,\" \"mortality,\" and \"deaths\". The initial search revealed 548 results, with an additional 182 sources added after reviewing associated references. After removing duplicates, 245 records were reviewed after which results were evaluated and stratified based on outcomes, yielding a total of 35 studies for final evaluation. Correlative and comparative analyses were performed evaluating trends in opioid prescription, patient-reported outcomes, incidence of complications, incidence of abuse and dependence, and mortality related to opioid use in knee osteoarthritis. Additionally, for each of the aims studied, a summative discussion relating study findings to clinical practice was performed. Outcomes from phase II and III trials of genetically engineered chondrocytes (GEC) injections were also analyzed with a focus on pain reduction. Nearly all studies report markedly increasing trends in opioid prescriptions, with some studies showing significant incremental increases in prescription rates (31 vs. 40%) over time. Additionally, projection models predict-based on current rates of prescribing opioids-that by 2030, prescriptions will triple from 1.1 million in 2015 to 3.0 million in 2030. Along with this, mean oral morphine equivalent dosages will also increase by 22% over a 15-year period. When evaluating patient-reported outcomes, multiple studies have found no significant differences in patient-reported pain outcomes between opioid and non-opioid users (p&gt;0.05). In fact, many studies even report poorer outcomes in patients who used opioids prior to surgical interventions. Opioid use was found to also be associated with increased referrals to pain management, longer in-hospital stays, and poorer Knee Society scores after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, some studies report as high as 42% of patients continue to use opioids after the initial 90-day postoperative period, and epidemiologic data for the United States reveals an over 20x increase in opioid-related deaths from 0.3 to 6.2 per 100,000 between 1999 and 2016. Our sub-analysis revealed that GEC injections were found to significantly improve reductions in visual analog scale (VAS) pain (-37.2 vs. -23.4 mm, p&lt;0.05) and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores (23.0 vs. 12.7, p&lt;0.05) between study and control cohorts, indicating this injection modality to potentially be a successful non-opioid based management technique that is safe and effective. The effects of the opioid epidemic on patients with knee osteoarthritis are severe. Excessive opioid use in these patients leads to poorer patient satisfactions as well as increased morbidities and mortalities. Therefore, there is a real need for alternative nonoperative treatment options that effectively reduce pain, and promising results from studies on the efficacy GEC injections demonstrate that they may be an answer to the opioid epidemic observed among osteoarthritis patients. ","374":"Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of the gallbladder is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis even after curative resection. The purpose of this study was to collate and analyze published data to clarify the surgical outcome of NEC of the gallbladder and the relationships between potential prognostic factors and survival after surgery. We surveyed worldwide literature from 1981 to 2018 and obtained clinicopathological data for 65 patients who had undergone surgical resection for NEC of the gallbladder. The relationships between potential prognostic factors and survival rates were examined by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-specific survival rates after surgery were 70.2%, 39.3%, and 29.5%, respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that the factors that were independently associated with poor outcomes after surgery in patients with NEC of the gallbladder were older age, higher pathologic T stage, and positive lymph node metastasis. The major sites of recurrence were the liver, lung, lymph node, and local recurrence. The median time to the event for recurrence was 4.0 months. Even when curative resection was achieved, 36.9% of patients exhibited recurrence within 12 months after curative resection of gallbladder NEC. Although NEC of the gallbladder remains a rare disease worldwide, its poor prognosis, even after curative resection, demands further epidemiological and pathological studies that could lead to the development of new management strategies.","375":"Urinary tract endometriosis is rare. The bladder is the most common site affected. The nonspecific symptoms can make a diagnosis difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and surgical outcomes in women who underwent surgical treatment for bladder endometriosis (BE). Ten patients who underwent surgical treatment for BE from January 2012 to November 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Pre- and postoperative data, intraoperative findings, type of surgical procedure, and intra- and postoperative complications were analyzed. Two women were treated by laparoscopic shaving of the bladder lesion and 8 underwent laparoscopic partial cystectomy. Simultaneous resection of coexisting pelvic nodules was performed. No conversions to laparotomy were observed. There was only one intraoperative complication. No major or minor postoperative complications were observed and none of the patients required repeated interventions. Improvements in clinical symptoms were reported and there was no increase in long-term urinary frequency after surgery. There was 1 case of urinary symptom recurrence. Laparoscopic partial cystectomy and shaving of the bladder lesion seem to improve urinary symptoms, with a low rate of intra- and postoperative complications and a low rate of recurrence, without affecting long-term bladder capacity. This surgical approach requires an experienced gynecologist and urologist team.

Unlike previous techniques, this method stresses the importance of accurate preoperative assessment and use of the surgeon's finger in the rectum to facilitate rectal wall preservation.","377":"Negative pressure therapy (NPT) seems to improve surgical outcomes in open abdomen (OA) management of severe intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). The aim of this study was to compare the effects of immediate vs. delayed application of NPT on outcomes in patients with IAIs after colonic perforation. We analysed 38 patients who received NPT during OA management for IAI after colonic perforation. The endpoints were treatment duration, definitive fascial closure and in-hospital mortality. We subdivided patients according to the timing of NPT application: immediate (at the end of the first OA procedure) and delayed (at I-II revision, at III revision, and after III revision). NPT was applied immediately in 15 cases (39.5%) and was delayed in 23 (60.5%): 14 (36.8%) at I-II revision, 7 (18.4%) at III revision, and 2 (5.3%) after III revision. Immediate NPT application was associated with the best outcomes. NPT should be used as soon as possible in OA management for IAIs due to colonic perforation. ","378":"Fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of childbearing age and can be found in almost 80-90% of all women by age 50 years. They can cause pain, excessive menstrual bleeding or infertility. The development of fibroids increases with age. Since the age of women in industrial countries who are trying to conceive is generally increasing, there has been a growing demand for minimally invasive and uterine-sparing surgical treatment of fibroids. Whereas the main focus of previous surgical techniques for the treatment of fibroids was enucleation of the tumour with subsequent closure of the uterine incision, modern devices developed over the past decade can destroy fibroids by using ultrasound or radio-frequency without incising the uterine wall. Thus, there is no uterine scar, which would impart a risk of rupture during labour or pregnancy. This article provides an overview of the latest techniques and devices used for uterine-sparing surgical treatment of fibroids. While laparoscopic myomectomy is still the gold standard, novel laparoscopic and transcervical radiofrequency ablation techniques use low-voltage and alternating current to induce heat in the uterine tissue, which triggers necrosis in fibroids. This enables the removal of multiple fibroids without the need for large incisions in the uterine wall. In addition, we address the benefits and potential risks, as well as the impact on fertility and pregnancy, of the different surgical approaches used for the treatment of uterine fibroids.","379":"Although multidisciplinary therapies have improved local control and overall survival in Ewing sarcoma (ES), the prognosis of pelvic lesions remains markedly worse than that of limb ES. We retrospectively evaluated the influence of the type of local treatment, margins, necrosis and sacrum involvement on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in a series of 21 non-metastatic pelvic ES. The average follow-up was 46.3 months (range 3-156). Only one patient had recurrence, at 11 months after surgery. Eight patients showed pulmonary metastasis and five showed bone metastases. Necrosis was the only significant prognostic factor for overall survival at 5 years (p=0.0132) and disease-free survival (p=0.0086). Overall survival at 5 years was 40.1%. Local control in pelvic Ewing sarcoma is comparable for patients treated with surgery (S), surgery plus radiotherapy (S\/RT), or definitive radiotherapy (RT). The combination of surgery plus radiotherapy could be indicated in cases of large tumor, a poor necrosis response (&lt; 90%), or an inadequate margin with involvement of the sacrum. A poor response to neoadjuvant therapy is a significant risk factor for both local control and overall survival.

Over the past few decades, a great body of knowledge has accumulated regarding the pathogenesis of IBD, and effective pharmaceutical agents, such as inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF), have been introduced. Although these agents have dramatically improved the outcome of IBD, up to 70% of patients with CD and 10-30% of those with UC still undergo surgery within 10 years from diagnosis. Because of their young age and high recurrence rates, these patients are appropriate candidates for laparoscopic surgery as an alternative to laparotomy. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on perioperative outcomes of patients who are receiving anti-TNF agents and require surgery. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss the current evidence regarding the impact of perioperative anti-TNF treatment on post-operative complication rates with a special focus on laparoscopic surgery.","382":"The search for alternatives to excisional surgery for internal hemorrhoids has been motivated by a desire to reduce postoperative pain and its associated disability as well as chronic sequelae. Among several non-excisional procedures, Doppler-guided transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD Doppler) has emerged as an alternative that offers minimal postoperative pain. However, there is some skepticism regarding the ligation of hemorrhoidal arteries, the usefulness of Doppler guidance, and the recurrence rates after THD Doppler. The aim of this narrative review is to compare THD to both non-excisional alternatives, such as rubber band ligation and stapled hemorrhoidopexy, and excisional alternatives, such as Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy. The authors seek to give readers concise insight into the evidence available in the English literature. This report does not offer a quantitative synthesis of the data, but rather highlights the role of THD Doppler in the treatment of internal hemorrhoids.","383":null,"384":"Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is a commonly performed procedure with a variety of mesh options. A relatively new mesh option is a non-woven polypropylene mesh with a silicone barrier designed for intraabdominal placement. This non-woven randomly oriented polypropylene microfiber hernia mesh may have benefits with potentially better biocompatibility compared with other ventral hernia repair mesh options. A clinical quality improvement (CQI) program was initiated for ventral hernia patients to better measure and improve outcomes. From March 2013 to September 2015, 62 laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs were performed with this non-woven polypropylene mesh on 61 patients (one patient had two separate hernia repairs). Attempts were made to obtain long-term (&gt; 2 years) follow up. There were 36 females and 25 males. The average age was 58.7 years (range 21-85). The average body mass index (BMI) was 36.2 (range 21.4-62.4). There were 51 (82%) incisional hernias and 11 (18%) primary hernias. There were 29 (47%) recurrent hernias. Mean hernia size was 83.4cm2 (range 1-400) and mean mesh size was 508.5cm2 (range 144-936). The mean operating room (OR) time was 108.2 minutes (range 38-418). The mean length of hospital stay was 2.7 days (range 0-13). There was one intraoperative complication-an injury to an inferior epigastric vessel that had a minor postoperative bleed that was self-limiting and required no treatment. There was one postoperative death due to aspiration on postoperative day #4. There has been one recurrence (1.6%) with long-term follow up. There were two patients (3.2%) with suture site pain postoperatively that resolved with suture site injections of local anesthetic in the clinic. There were no patients that required rehospitalization within 30 days after surgery. There were no mesh-related complications and no incidence of mesh removal was required. The results for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, using a relatively new non-woven randomly oriented polypropylene microfiber mesh, are good with long-term follow up completed in the majority of patients. More experience with this type of mesh could generate evidence for the benefits of this mesh material in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. ","385":null,"386":"A posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) rupture is less common than an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. PCL reconstruction remains controversial with variable outcomes and problems. The encouraging results of the novel ACL repair techniques led to renewed interest in PCL repair. Primary arthroscopic PCL repair has been rarely discussed and literature is scarce. To the best of our knowledge, no PCL repair patient outcome has been reported with one of the novel PCL repair techniques. We present the first case report of two patients who have been treated with the novel PCL repair technique, the suture tape augmentation technique. Two patients who underwent primary PCL repair after an acute PCL rupture with a two-year follow up are presented. Patients were evaluated according to the Lysholm scale, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and the Tegner activity scale. Follow up also included objective physical examinations-knee function and posterior drawer test using a rolimeter-and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Physical examinations were performed at three months, six months, one year, and two years after surgery. At two-year follow up, both patients had a full range of motion and experienced no pain, nor swelling. IKDC scores were 83% (good) and 100% (excellent), Lysholm scores were 99 and 100 two years after surgery. At three months postoperative, the Tegner activity scale equaled the preinjury Tegner activity scale. One patient was horseback riding within three months. There were some increased posterior translation differences after two years-+2 and +3mm-compared with six weeks postoperative. MRI showed a healed PCL in both cases. PCL repair could be a promising treatment option for acute PCL ruptures. Advantages of this technique are the retaining of the natural proprioceptive capacities due to preserving native PCL fibers, the surgical technique is less invasive compared to a reconstruction, and no donor graft morbidity is expected as no graft is needed. In these two cases, good subjective and objective results are demonstrated after PCL repair using the novel suture tape augmentation technique. MRI confirmed the healing of the PCL. Although this is a small case series, as PCL ruptures are less common compared to ACL ruptures, it is a stepping-stone for further PCL repair research. ","387":"Dependent functional status (DEP) has been associated with higher postoperative adverse events and mortality compared to patients with independent functional status (IND). However, the association between preoperative functional status and perioperative outcomes after primary TKA has not been well reported. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate this association. Specifically, we asked: 1) does preoperative functional status impact perioperative outcomes following primary TKA, and 2) is DEP functional status prior to primary TKA an independent risk factor for 30-day complications?","388":"Endovascular treatment of arterial diseases has become first-line in most cases due to improved technology. However, until recently, excessive atherosclerotic calcification has been a major limiting factor in the endovascular management of peripheral arterial disease, as well as vascular access for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The Peripheral Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) System (Shockwave Medical, Inc., Fremont California) applies pulsatile mechanical energy under fluoroscopic guidance to disrupt calcified lesions. The purpose of this paper is to introduce IVL in the treatment of calcific access vessels in preparation for EVAR and TAVR, as well as peripheral arterial disease applications to enhance luminal gain. Using the IVL System, angioplasty can be performed with lower pressures, which may minimize arterial dissection. Further, the lithotripsy effect on calcium will enhance vessel compliance. We describe several cases where IVL was applied successfully and present additional cases that may have benefitted from the use of this technology.","389":"Porous surface acetabular shells have been successfully used in cementless total hip arthroplasty. Recent advances in additive manufacturing have provided opportunities to optimize the shell designs. The current study describes the design and verification of a new acetabular shell design. Additive manufacturing technology was used to fabricate acetabular shells using Ti6Al4V powder. A large computed tomography (CT) database was used to verify the screw hole location to ensure the screw trajectories were directed in the safe zone. Benchtop stability tests were conducted to compare the fixation stability of the new shell design to a clinically successful design. Shells were designed with an average pore size of 434 microns, surface porosity of 76%, and a coefficient of friction of 1.2. The CT analysis of various shell orientations demonstrated that at least two useful screws were typically directed toward the acetabular safe zone. The sawbone testing showed that the fixation stability of the new shell was either better or equivalent to the clinically successful design under two different bone preparation conditions. Using additive manufacturing technology, thin walled acetabular shells were fabricated which allowed for at least two ancillary fixation screws in the safe zone. The thin walls enable the use of a 36mm femoral head with a 48mm diameter shell which may enhance the joint stability in small stature patients. The equivalent or better fixation stability of the new design indicates that good initial fixation may be expected in vivo. ","390":"Technological advances in the field of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) over the past decade have led to numerous methods for monitoring metabolism and coagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), as well as materials with improved biocompatibility, which has reduced the risk associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. However, ECC is still predominantly based on a traditional design that involves the use of roller pumps. This exposes the patient to a variety of pathophysiological consequences, both intra- and postoperative, such as postoperative cognitive disorders, hemolysis and hemodilution, systemic inflammation and changes in coagulation. This article describes the advantages of an ECC circuit inspired by the Fibonacci Golden Ratio, which does not use a roller pump, in a prospective study on patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, compared to conventional ECC. During CPB, echocardiography was used to estimate the quality of fluid dynamics in the extracorporeal circuit and the patient's arterial vessels, a DO2 management system was used to evaluate metabolism, and an electronic system was used to determine gaseous microemboli (GME) counts. Fibonacci ECC offered superior intraoperative fluid dynamics, reduced the production of and improved the elimination of GME, and improved intraoperative metabolism, particularly with regard to oxygen delivery and extraction. The improvements in fluid dynamics and metabolic variables were associated with a reduction in the incidence of pathophysiological events compared to the conventional system, particularly regarding transitory cognitive disorders, and a shorter stay in intensive care.","391":"Despite the success of total hip arthroplasty (THA), postoperative pain management remains a concern. Although the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intravenous (IV) diclofenac is a promising addition, its impact on THA outcomes has not been investigated. This study evaluates the effects of adjunctive IV diclofenac on: 1) postoperative pain intensity; 2) opioid consumption; 3) discharge destination; 4) length of stay; and 5) patient satisfaction in primary THA patients. A retrospective study was performed for patients who underwent primary THA by a single surgeon between May 1 and September 31, 2017. Patients of the study group (n=25) were treated postoperatively with IV diclofenac and the standard pain control regimen while the control group (n=88) did not receive diclofenac. Patients receiving adjunctive IV diclofenac were more likely to be discharged home than to inpatient facilities (O.R. 4.02; p=0.049). Patient satisfaction with respect to how well and how often pain was controlled (p= 0.0436 and p=0.0217, respectively) was significantly greater in the IV diclofenac group. Patients who received IV diclofenac had lower opioid consumption on postoperative days one and two (-67.2 and -129.0mg, respectively; p=0.001 for both). The growth of THA as an outpatient procedure has intensified the urgency of improving postoperative pain management. This study demonstrates that THA patients receiving adjunctive IV diclofenac were more likely to be discharged home, had reduced opioid consumption, and experienced greater satisfaction. To further investigate the optimal regimen, future studies comprising a larger cohort and comparing IV diclofenac to other NSAIDs are warranted.","392":null,"393":"A variety of highly porous materials have been used to obtain biological acetabular fixation after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Due to their improved surface-coated properties, new highly porous titanium metal implants have shown potential to promote prosthesis osseointegration. Therefore, the purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate: 1) overall acetabular cup survivorship; 2) postoperative complications; and 3) radiographic signs of loosening and radiolucencies in patients who received a new highly porous titanium metal cup. A total of 81 patients who underwent primary THA and received a new porous acetabular cup between May 16, 2013 and January 27, 2016 at three academic centers were included for analysis. There were 40 women (49%) and 41 men (51%) who had a mean age of 65 years (range, 38 to 95 years) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28 kg\/m2 (range, 16 to 43 kg\/m2). The minimum follow up time was two years and seven months (range, 2 to 4 years). The cup was engineered with fully interconnected porosity designed for potential long-term biologic fixation. Medical records were reviewed to assess for any revision surgeries and postoperative complications, and the most recent radiographs were reviewed for signs of loosening or radiolucencies. Overall, acetabular component survivorship, free of fixation failure or aseptic loosening, was 100%. Two patients underwent revision due to dislocations; however, revisions were performed because no constrained or dual mobility liners were available for the shell at the time. Both patients had successful outcomes and were doing well at final follow up with no further episodes of dislocation. There was one open reduction internal fixation for a periprosthetic femoral fracture, and three polyethylene revisions were performed for instability. In all of these cases, the acetabular cup was retained. On radiographic evaluation of antero-posterior pelvis radiographs, there was one patient who had radiolucencies of &lt;1mm in Zone 1 and Zone 2 at 15 months after surgery, and another patient demonstrated radiolucencies of &lt;1mm in Zone 2 and 3 at one-year follow up. At a minimum of two-year follow up, both patients had non-progressive and stable findings. The results of this study demonstrated excellent survivorship, and there were no radiographic failures of this acetabular cup in primary total hip arthroplasty patients. Although two patients were found to have minimal (&lt;1mm) radiolucencies, these were not progressive. Longer follow-up studies are needed to further assess the survivorship and outcomes of this new acetabular cup; however, based on the results of this study, these are expected to be favorable. ","394":"Self-fixating mesh has been introduced to further improve the quality results already seen with laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. An observational study was undertaken to evaluate the technical learning curve and mid-term outcomes associated with the use of ProGrip (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) laparoscopic self-fixating mesh in transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal herniorrhaphy. Patients who underwent elective laparoscopic TAPP inguinal herniorrhaphy by a single surgeon using ProGrip laparoscopic self-fixating mesh within a one-year period were studied. The primary outcome measures included the time from mesh introduction to the final position (MI-FP), surgical complications, and pain scores. Demographic and other perioperative outcome data were collected and analyzed. Forty hernias were repaired in 29 patients with a laparoscopic TAPP approach. The average MI-FP was 249.4 seconds for the first 20 repairs, and 118.6 seconds (p &lt; 0.001) for the final 20. Minor post-operative surgical complications were reported by 13.8% of patients; there were no major surgical complications. The average pain score on a scale of 0 to 5 was 0.9 (SD = 0.67, range 0-3). Surgeons with reasonable laparoscopic experience can expect to become fully proficient in the manipulation of self-fixating mesh after 15 to 20 repairs. Use of this product yielded low intraoperative and mid-term postoperative complication rates as well as low postoperative pain. ","395":"This paper presents two patients who sustained spontaneous closed Achilles tendon ruptures following minimally invasive ultrasonic energy therapy for non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy. In both cases, the patients underwent minimally invasive ultrasonic energy therapy using a commercially available device. In addition, the current evidence, through available literature, has been reviewed and presented.","396":"Despite the demonstrated success of modern total knee arthroplasty (TKA), it remains a procedure that involves sophisticated preoperative planning and meticulous technique to reconstruct the mechanical axis, achieve ideal joint balance, and restore maximal range-of-motion (ROM). Recently, robotic-arm assisted TKAs have emerged as a promising new technology offering several technical advantages, and it is achieving excellent radiological results, including establishing the posterior condylar offset ratio (PCOR) and the Insall-Salvati Index (ISI). Studies have demonstrated that these parameters are surgically modifiable, and their accurate restoration (fewer mean differences) correlate with improved final joint range-of-motion. However, there is a paucity of studies that evaluate these parameters in light of performing robotic-arm assisted TKA. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare: 1) PCOR and 2) ISI restoration in a cohort of patients who underwent robotic-arm assisted versus manual TKA. We evaluated a series of 43 consecutive robotic-arm assisted (mean age 67 years; range, 46 to 79 years) and 39 manual total knee arthroplasties (mean age 66 years; range, 48 to 78 years) performed by seven fellowship-trained joint reconstructive surgeons. All surgeries were performed using medial para-patellar approaches by high-volume surgeons. Using the Knee Society Radiographic Evaluation System, preoperative and four-to six-week postoperative radiographs were analyzed to determine the PCOR and patella height based on the ISI. The mean postoperative PCOR was larger in manual TKA when compared to the robotic-assisted cohort (0.53 vs. 0.49; p=0.024). The absolute mean difference between pre- and postoperative PCOR was larger in manual when compared to robotic-arm assisted TKA (0.03 vs. 0.004; p=0.01). In addition, the number of patients who had postoperative ISI outside of the normal range (0.8 to 0.12) was higher in the manual cohort (12 vs. 4). Patients who underwent TKA using robotic-arm assisted technology had smaller mean differences in PCOR which has been previously shown to correlate with better joint ROM at one year following surgery. In addition, these patients were less likely to have values outside of normal ISI, which means they are less likely to develop patella baja, a condition in which the patella would impinge onto the patellar component, leading to restricted flexion and overall decreased ROM. ","397":"While tranexamic acid (TXA) has been well shown to reduce blood loss after joint replacement surgery, little is known regarding its effectiveness in obese patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of TXA changes in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels as well as incidence of packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions in obese patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Between January 2014 and May 2015, 420 consecutive primary joint replacements were performed by two surgeons at our institution. One-hundred-fifty-seven patients (total hip arthroplasty [THA]=29; total knee arthroplasty [TKA]=128) were obese with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg\/m2. Medical records were reviewed and identified that TXA was utilized in 85 (54.1%) arthroplasties (study group) and was compared to a consecutive series of 72 (45.9%) TJAs (control group). TXA was given intravenously (IV) in two doses: (1) one gram prior to incision and (2) one gram at the time of femoral preparation in THA or prior to cementation in TKA. Changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, number of pRBC transfusions, and occurrence of thrombolytic events were recorded. The changes in hematocrit (7.2% vs. 8.1%) and hemoglobin levels (3.0 g\/dl vs. 3.3 g\/dl) were less in the group that received TXA than the control group, albeit not significantly (p=0.100 and p=0.278, respectively). Within the control group, 26 (36.1%) patients required a pRBC transfusion with a mean of 2.0 units per patient (range:1-5); whereas, only eight (9.4%) patients with TXA required a mean of 1.6 units per patient (range: 1-2). The use of TXA significantly reduced the incidence of pRBC transfusions, especially in TKA (p&lt;0.001). Sub-analyses revealed that transfusion rates were even more significantly reduced by TXA in obesity type II and III. Two pulmonary emboli were reported in the group that did not receive TXA; whereas, no thrombolytic events were reported in the group that did receive TXA. Utilization of TXA significantly reduced the rate of pRBC transfusions in obese patients. ","398":"A common technique for ventral and incisional hernia repair is the retrorectus repair (Rives-Stoppa). The posterior rectus sheath is incised bilaterally, and mesh is placed retromuscularly. There is little information on how this component separation technique affects abdominal wall tension. We evaluated abdominal wall tension in patients undergoing retrorectus repair of abdominal wall hernias. Patients undergoing retrorectus repair of their ventral hernias were enrolled in a prospective, Institutional Review Board-approved protocol to measure abdominal wall tension from 8\/1\/2013 to 8\/2\/2017. Demographic information and operative details were documented. Abdominal wall tensions were measured using scales attached to Kocher clamps that were clamped to the fascia and brought together in the midline. Measurements were made before and after incising the posterior rectus sheaths. Data were analyzed with a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and differences between individual groups were analyzed by least square differences. Forty-five patients had tension measurements. Average age was 58 years (range 29-81)-78% Caucasian, 51% female, an average body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg\/m2 (range 20-62), and 38% recurrent hernias. The average hernia defect was 121.9 cm2, and the average mesh size was 607.8 cm2. There was a significant reduction in tension after bilateral posterior rectus sheath incision (3.1 lbs vs. 5.6 lbs, p&lt;0.0001). In this evaluation, abdominal wall tension measurements are shown to be a feasible adjunct during open hernia repair with retrorectus repair. Transection of the posterior rectus sheath decreases tension during hernia repair and may help guide surgeons regarding when to use this procedure.","399":"Leakage of the anastomosis after colorectal surgery is a severe complication, and one of the most important causes is poor vascular supply. However, a microvascular deficit is often not detectable during surgery under white light. Near-infrared indocyanine green (ICG)-enhanced fluorescence may be useful for assessing microvascular deficits and conceivably preventing anastomotic leakage. This paper presents a preliminary retrospective case series on robotic colorectal surgery. The aim is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and role of near-infrared ICG-enhanced ?uorescence for the intraoperative assessment of peri-anastomotic tissue vascular perfusion. From among more than 164 robotic colorectal cases performed, we retrospectively analyzed 28 that were all performed by the same surgeon (PCG) using near-infrared ICG-enhanced fluorescence technology: 16 left colectomies (57.1%), 8 rectal resections (28.6%), 3 right colectomies (10.8%) and 1 pancolectomy (3.6%). The rates of conversion, intraoperative complications, dye allergic reaction and mortality were all 0%. In two cases (7.1%)-1 left and 1 right colectomy-the level of the anastomosis was changed intraoperatively after ICG showed ischemic tissues. Despite the application of ICG, one anastomotic leak (after left colectomy for a chronic recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis with pericolic abscess) was observed. ICG technology may help to determine when to intraoperatively change the anastomotic level to a safer location. In our case series, ICG results led to a change in the level of the anastomosis in 7.1% of the cases. Despite the use of ICG, we observed one leak. This may have been related to vascularization-independent causes (e.g., infection in this case) or may reflect a need for better standardization of this ICG technology. In particular, we need a way to objectively assess the ICG signal and the related risk of leakage. More randomized, prospective, well-powered trials are needed to unveil the full potential of this innovative surgical technology. ","400":"This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the new Senhance Robotic System (TransEnterix Inc., Morrisville, North Carolina) for inguinal hernia repairs using the transabdominal preperitoneal approach. From March to September 2017, 76 inguinal hernia repairs in 64 patients were performed using the Senhance Robotic System. Patients were between 18 and 90 years of age, eligible for a laparoscopic procedure with general anesthesia, had no life-threatening disease with a life expectancy of less than 12 months, and a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 35. A retrospective chart review was performed for a variety of pre-, peri-, and postoperative data including, but not limited to, patient demographics, hernia characteristics, and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Fifty-four male and 10 female patients were included in the study. Median age was 56.5 years (range 22-86 years), and median BMI was 25.9 kg\/m2 (range 19.5-31.8 kg\/m2). Median docking time was seven minutes (range 2-21 minutes), and median operative time was 48 minutes (range 18-142 minutes). Two cases were converted to standard laparoscopic surgery due to robot malfunction and abdominal wall bleeding, respectively. Median length of stay was one day. We report the first series of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs using the new Senhance Robotic System. Compared to conventional laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repairs, there was no significant difference in operative time or perioperative complications. Additionally, there was no significant learning curve detected due to its intuitive applicability. Therefore, the Senhance Robotic System promises broad applicability across a range of laparoscopic general surgical operations. ","401":".","402":"Over time, various materials and techniques have been developed for superficial and deep wound closure. However, potential complications, such as infections and dehiscences, can still occur, driving the development of new closure modalities. As wound closure technology continues to advance and change, the need to continuously evaluate the current techniques and materials persists. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the current literature on the various closure materials and techniques utilized for total knee arthroplasty. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) closure times; 2) infections and complication rates; as well as 3) costs related to superficial and deep wound closures. Based on the findings from the current literature, barbed suture was associated with significantly shorter closing times in all five studies when compared to interrupted sutures (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, the use of barbed sutures may result in similar postoperative complication rates. Although the cost of an individual barbed suture is potentially higher than the cost of an individual conventional suture, a knotless technique can require a shorter suture length, which might also help decrease costs.","403":"At least 15% of patients with critical limb ischemia are not candidates for standard revascularization. In this day and age, with new techniques-including retrograde access to the foot-and numerous angioplasty and atherectomy techniques available, the critical limb ischemia patient can still be faced without options. Distal bypass surgery may still remain the gold standard, and likely permits the patient to have the best options for healing, but carries significant comorbidities after undergoing the procedure. There are patients who do not have targets of interest in their foot for arterial revascularization and there are patients who have very poor conduit or are very poor candidates due to their medical comorbidities. Guidelines as to who should and should not undergo surgery-or even percutaneous revascularization-are starting to become more widely accepted. We are starting to see the tide change and there is interest in this cohort of patients. There are patients with no distal target that may benefit from an arteriovenous bypass, which is regaining popularity and can be done completely endovascularly. The patient that may be a very poor candidate for intervention may benefit from arterial counterpulsation therapy and\/or topical oxygen therapy (which are commercially available). They may also benefit from placental stem cell injection, which is undergoing Phase II trial assessment. We will review the current literature as it surrounds these potential therapeutic interventions for patients with significant lower extremity ischemia who do not have standard revascularization options.","404":"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation has dramatically changed the treatment of valvular heart disease over the past decade. At the same time, the indications for bioprosthesis implantation have been continuously extended toward younger patients, driven by excellent clinical results and improved durability. While the omission of oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of severe bleeding complications, the long-term durability of bioprostheses is still limited. In light of the growing number of elderly transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients, the prevalence of patients with failed bioprostheses and advanced comorbidities is expected to rise. Currently, transcatheter valve-in-valve (ViV) and valve-in-ring (ViR) interventions represent a valuable alternative treatment option for patients with a high risk for surgical reoperation. Several reports have described a high procedural success rate and low postprocedural morbidity and mortality during mid-term follow-up. We are still facing valve-specific and procedure-related challenges in all types of procedures, but especially in transcatheter ViR interventions. Considering the high technical demand of these interventions, a strong and highly specialized heart team in heart valve centers is the cornerstone of successful patient treatment. This review focuses on individualized patient selection, procedure-specific risk factors and technical aspects of transcatheter ViV\/R interventions, and explores the currently available literature on postinterventional outcome.","405":"Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) in thyroid gland surgery provides real-time feedback to the endocrine surgeon regarding the electrophysiological consequences of surgical manipulation of the laryngeal nerves. The goal of monitoring modalities is to detect surgical or physiological insults to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) while they are still reversible or, in cases where prevention is not an option, to minimize the damage done to these structures during thyroidectomy. In recent decades, monitoring of the RLN has become a fundamental part of endocrine surgery. IONM is a feasible procedure in both open and endoscopic, robotic thyroidectomy. Experts in IONM have organized a working group of general, endocrine, head and neck ENT surgeons and endocrinologists (International Neural Monitoring Study Group; INMSG) to develop standards for practicing this technique in endoscopic and robotic thyroidectomy. This paper presents recent clinical and research experience with intraoperative neural monitoring for thyroid gland surgery.","406":"Laparoscopic colectomy represents a safe, effective and well-established procedure for both benign and malignant colic disease. Transanal anastomosis (TA) with a circular stapler is the most commonly performed anastomotic technique in laparoscopic left hemicolectomy (LLH). We report our experience with side-to-side anastomosis (STSA) and side-to-end anastomosis (STEA) in selected patients with both emergency and elective LLH. A systematic review of the PubMed database was performed on recent studies that compared different anastomotic techniques after LLH. We collected internal data from June 2014 to July 2018 and compared our experience with the literature. The primary outcome was the anastomotic complication rate. During the observation period, 158 patients underwent left hemicolectomy (LH). One-hundred-nineteen patients had malignant disease; 36 underwent surgery for complicated diverticular disease, one had a large strangulated incisional hernia, one had a sigmoid volvulus, and one had a sigmoid localization of endometriosis. Thirty open left hemicolectomies were performed. In 128 cases, a minimally invasive approach was used. Since conversion to open was necessary in 10 of these cases, 118 were totally LLH. STSA was performed in 64 cases; seven in an emergency setting and 57 in elective procedures. The overall anastomotic leak rate was 3.1% (2\/64) and no anastomotic leak was reported in the emergency group (0\/7). TA was performed in 15 cases, 93% in an elective setting (14\/15), and the anastomotic leak rate was 13.3% (2\/15). In 20 cases, we performed elective STEA and no anastomotic leak was recorded. In 19 cases, it was impossible to perform anastomosis and we decided to create a definitive colostomy. Consistent with the literature data, our experience shows that, in selected cases, STSA and STEA are both safe and effective, with a lower anastomotic complication rate than TA. ","407":"There is no consensus regarding whether splenic flexure mobilization (SFM) should be performed selectively or routinely for sigmoid and rectal resections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of SFM on anastomotic leak and surgical site infection rates in sigmoid and rectal resections. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched by two independent researchers. Anastomotic leak was the primary endpoint. Inclusion criteria were clinical studies comparing SFM to non-SFM during sigmoid and rectal resections. The Mantel-Haenszel method with a random-effects model was used. The odds ratio (OR) was used for dichotomous variables, whereas the mean difference (MD) was used for continuous variables. Six of 74 potentially eligible studies totaling 12,398 patients (4,356 with SFM and 8,042 without SFM) were selected for further examination. The overall bias risk was found to be high. There was no significant difference in anastomotic leak rates when SFM patients were compared to their non-SFM counterparts [OR (95%CI) = 2.00 (0.95, 4.18); p=0.07]. SFM patients had a longer operating time [MD (95%CI) = 31.62 (24.51, 38.72); p&lt;0.001] and increased incisional SSI rates compared to their non-SFM counterparts [11.1% vs. 9.1%; OR (95%CI) = 1.23 (1.09, 1.40); p=0.0008]. A subgroup analysis of rectal cancer cases found significantly higher anastomotic leak rates with SFM [5.4% vs. 1.5%; OR (95%CI) = 2.37 (1.09, 5.16); p=0.03]. This systematic review found that SFM was not associated with significantly decreased anastomotic leak rates. SSI rates were significantly increased in patients undergoing SFM.

This study examines the survival and outcome of lateral unicompartmental arthroplasty utilizing the first implant specifically developed for the lateral compartment. A retrospective review was performed to detect lateral unicompartmental arthroplasty procedures performed in our practice between January 2013 and May 2016. Patients indicated for surgery met specific preoperative clinical and radiographic criteria confirming lateral compartment arthritic disease with a correctable deformity, intact full-thickness medial cartilage, competent anterior cruciate ligament, and minimal disease in the patellofemoral compartment. A single implant design was used in all cases which consisted of a fixed-bearing tibial component specifically adapted to lateral compartment anatomy. Unicompartmental arthroplasty surgical technique was adjusted to attempt to recreate lateral compartment kinematics. Fifty-two consecutive patients (56 knees) with lateral unicompartmental arthroplasty procedures meeting minimum two-year follow up were included in the study. Thirty-nine patients were female, and 93% of cases were performed for treatment of osteoarthritis. At a mean follow up of nearly three years, Knee Society clinical and functional scores improved postoperatively by a mean difference of 41 and 21, respectively. There were two reoperations, one medial unicompartmental arthroplasty for osteoarthritis progression and a superficial debridement for a non-healing wound. Thus, failure of lateral unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) was less than 2% in this study. There were no other component revisions, radiographic evidence of loosening, or clinical failures. At early follow up, lateral unicompartmental arthroplasty using a modified surgical technique and an implant specifically designed for the lateral compartment is a reliable treatment for isolated lateral femorotibial arthritis when meeting defined indications. ","410":"Bilateral hip fractures after low-energy mechanism are a rare phenomenon. Most published case reports include presentations of bilateral hip fractures in the elderly with low-energy mechanism. There is no report, to our knowledge, that illustrates this rare occurrence in middle-aged individuals after a low-energy fall from standing height. We present a case of a 50-year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presented to our institution with bilateral valgus-impacted femoral neck fractures after a mechanical fall from standing height. The patient underwent successful in-situ percutaneous screw placement in bilateral hips. Although patient age is an obvious risk factor, middle-aged individuals with a medical history affecting bone mineral content may also be prone to bilateral insufficiency fractures. Individuals complaining of joint pain (with a history of conditions including renal failure, obesity, endocrinopathies, etc.) should have advanced imaging, if screening plain radiographs are negative, in an effort to identify occult fractures. ","411":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the ergonomics of laparoscopy as well as the lack of tactile feedback in robotic surgery on intracorporeal suturing. This was a prospective cohort study that compared the first 12 consecutive robotic hand-sewn ileocolic anastomoses to matched laparoscopic cases performed by the same surgeon. The endpoints were interrupted suturing and tying time, and the numbers of interrupted sutures placed and torn. Propensity score matching was based on age, body mass index, previous abdominal surgery, and diagnosis. Ileocolic anastomoses were hand-sewn in two layers: running 3-0 polyglycolic acid and interrupted 3-0 silk. Continuous variables were compared using the Student t test, whereas a Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. Linear regression and a cumulative sum analysis (CUSUM) were used for quality control. Median time for robotic suturing and tying was significantly shorter than that in matched laparoscopic cases (89.5 sec (IQR 76-103.5) vs. 160 sec (IQR 146-210), p&lt;0.0001). There were fewer torn sutures in laparoscopic suturing (1 (IQR 1-2.5) vs. 0 (IQR 0-0.5), p&lt;0.0026). No differences were found in complication rates (6 vs. 2 p=0.19). CUSUM analysis did not show a significant improvement in the number of torn sutures over time. Although there were more torn sutures with robotic suturing and tying, significantly less time was required than for laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing. This study suggests that torn sutures may be the result of a lack of tactile feedback rather than the presence of a learning curve. ","412":"Few reports in the literature have described the use of an osteochondral allograft for the treatment of articular cartilage damage of the 1st metatarsal phalangeal joint. We present here the clinical outcomes and detailed surgical technique of four cases in which we used a cryopreserved, viable, osteochondral allograft (CVOCA) for full cartilage replacement of the first metatarsal head to address degenerative articular cartilage damage. At 10-22 months of follow-up, patients reported clinical improvement, with VAS pain-scale scores decreasing from an average of 8.0 to 0 post-operatively, and range-of-motion improvement from an average of 4.3 degrees to 58.3 degrees dorsiflexion. Radiographic improvement was also seen, with an increase in average joint space from 1.1mm, 1.5mm, and 2.2mm from medial to lateral on dorsoplantar views pre-operatively, to 3.1mm, 2.8mm, and 3.1mm 15 months post-operatively, respectively. These results suggest that CVOCA is a desirable treatment option for end-stage degenerative joint disease of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint.","413":"With the transition toward a value-based care delivery model, an evidence-based approach to quantify the effect of procedural volume on outcomes and cost presents an opportunity to understand and optimize the delivery of lower extremity arthroplasty. Stratum-specific likelihood ratio (SSLR) analysis has been recently applied to define benchmarks which confer a significant advantage in value at the hospital or surgeon level. In this report, the role, statistical technique, and future applications of SSLR analysis are described with an example outlined for total hip arthroplasty (THA). SSLR analysis provides multiple significant value-based thresholds, providing an advantage over previous methods used to describe the effects of surgeon and hospital volume. These benchmarks have been developed for THA, total knee arthroplasty (TKA), hip fracture, and several other orthopaedic procedures. Current SSLR analyses are limited by the databases employed, and the study of a national database may provide more generalizable benchmarks, which may be applied by hospitals and orthopaedic residencies to define minimum competency thresholds. The use of SSLR analysis provides a pragmatic, data-driven approach to understanding and communicating the volume-value relationship in orthopaedic surgery, particularly lower-extremity arthroplasty. ","414":null,"415":"The presence of enterocele may interfere with the surgical approach for obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) as it may represent a contraindication to stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR), and tactics to overcome this problem have been debated. A change in the patient's position during surgery may be a means to overcome an enterocele. We sought to determine whether an enterocele could be completely reduced when the patient is placed in the prone position during fluoroscopic defecography (FD). Patients of a Colon and Rectal Surgery Residency Program undergoing FD for any condition from August 2012 to May 2016 were enrolled. For participants with an enterocele documented during FD, projections in the prone position were also obtained. Data regarding sex, age, pelvic floor laxity, rectocele, intussusception, sigmoidocele, enterocele and its reduction in the prone position were recorded for all participants. Enterocele reduction was analyzed by Fisher's exact test. A total of 101 patients were enrolled and an enterocele was found in 63 (62.3%). Among the patients with an enterocele, in 48 (76.2%) it was completely reduced when the patient was placed in the prone position (p-value = 0.000195; 95% CI 63.79 - 86.02). Complete enterocele reduction in the prone position during FD was highly statistically significant. This finding may safely eliminate enterocele as a contraindication to STARR. These results suggest that a projection in the prone position should be added to the standard sequence obtained during FD for patients who may be eligible for a transanal surgical approach. Validation studies are needed to assess whether this change can lead to lower enterocele-related complications in STARR. ","416":"Instability can account for over 20% of all revision total hip arthroplasties (THAs). Although a number of surgical techniques have been developed to limit the number of dislocations, prevention still remains a challenge. More recently, dual mobility (DM) cups have been developed to potentially target this problem. Although this implant design has been shown to have a number of potential advantages in the revision setting, there is limited data in the literature on the use of modular dual mobility (MDM) implants for primary THAs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate cup survivorships, patient satisfaction outcomes, and complications of this device used for primary THA. A total of 143 consecutive hips (131 patients) who underwent primary THA using DM prostheses by a high-volume academic surgeon were longitudinally followed up for a minimum of five years (mean: 6 years, 11 months; range, 6 years 3 months to 7 years 5 months). There were 77 women (54%) and 66 men (44%) who had a mean age 65 years (range, 34 to 90 years; SD, 11 years), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 32 kg\/m2 (range, 22 to 52; SD, 8 kg\/m2). Patient demographics, (gender, BMI), as well as clinical outcomes were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine aseptic, septic, and all-cause cup survivorship. Additionally, clinical outcomes based on Harris Hip Scores (HHS) and other modalities, as well as complications, were tabulated. Institutional review board (IRB) approval was received prior to initiating this study. Septic survivorship was found to be 99.3% (95% CI: 0.98 to 1.0), while all-cause survivorship was 98.6% (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.0). There were a total of two revision surgeries; however, these were not related to the MDM cup. Specifically, one patient had femoral stem loosening, while another patient had a late deep infection treated with a two-stage procedure. At most recent follow up, both patients were progressing well and had HHS scores of 85 and 92 points. The mean total HHS score was 95 points (range, 64 to 100) at most recent follow up. Other complications affecting patient outcomes included two patients who presented with concerns for deep vein thrombi, which were both medically managed, as well as one patient who had a non-fatal pulmonary embolism, which was also medically managed. The final HHS scores for these three patients were 83, 100, and 96 points. DM cups were designed with the intent of reducing hip instability. Most studies on these cups have reported on revision THA, where the problem of instability may be more paramount; however, fewer studies have reported on the use of this cup for primary THA. The findings from this study indicate excellent survivorship and overall clinical and patient satisfaction results using this construct. These five-year results are very encouraging and hopefully will portend excellent further survivorship with longer follow up. ","417":"Placental and amniotic membrane-based tissues have gained widespread popularity for their ability to promote healing and tissue regeneration and have manifested multiple applications in wound care, burn treatment, and management of various ocular conditions. Recently, there have been multiple studies that investigated the nonoperative uses of placental tissue-based products in orthopaedic sports injuries. However, there is a relative paucity of studies that have attempted to evaluate their adjuvant operative uses. Therefore, the aim of this review was to evaluate the use of placental and amniotic tissue-based products as an adjuvant treatment to the operative management of orthopaedic sports injuries. A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, EBSCO Host, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Studies published between January 1, 2000 and June 1, 2018 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were that studies should have reported on: 1) operative uses of placental tissue matrix therapy in tendons and ligaments injuries; and 2) clinical outcomes; in 3) human subjects. In addition, the following studies were excluded: 1) animal studies; 2) basic science studies; 3) non-English language studies; 4) review studies; and 5) duplicate studies across databases. Additionally, to determine the various product compositions and indications for use, we searched publicly available manufacturer's website content, marketing literature, FDA registration documents, and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services submissions to assess the key differences for each of the products. Current evidence has led to investigation of various placental and amniotic membrane products used as an adjuvant treatment to surgical reconstruction of various types of tendon injuries, with a demonstrated effectiveness found mostly in the short-term, with follow up ranging between five weeks and two years. In addition, their safety and minimal complication profile have been demonstrated. Marked differences exist among the currently available products due to variations in their formulations, tissue source, processing methodology, sterilization method, preservation and storage methods, indications for use, and FDA regulation. Operative uses of placental and amniotic membrane-derived tissues appear to be safe when utilized as an adjuvant or augmentation option along with surgical reconstruction. However, several factors may come into play when considering the diversity of commercially available products. Future clinical trials will need to confirm the safety and demonstrate clearer indications and specific guidelines for use in each clinical scenario involving operative management of tendon injuries. Nevertheless, this review will serve as an up-to-date reference and provide an impetus for future investigations. ","418":"Shared decision-making (SDM) between the patient and physician is receiving increased attention as a way to improve patient satisfaction and value of care. Having a readily implemented tool available to inform conversation may enable SDM at a high-volume gynecologic surgery practice. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of an SDM tool on patients' decision to have minimally invasive gynecology surgery. We conducted a feasibility study using the SDM tool plus a follow-up survey for 100 patients recommended to undergo minimally invasive hysterectomy. Nearly all patients (97%) indicated that they were satisfied with their decision to undergo a minimally invasive procedure, including laparoscopic total and supracervical hysterectomy with or without the aid of the robotic platform. Anecdotally, patients expressed appreciation for the provided materials and the presentation of care options. For the care provider, use of the SDM tool did not add substantial time to the visit. Knowing that comprehensive information was provided to all patients was reassuring. Implementing a shared decision-making model in a gynecological practice is feasible and increases awareness and engagement, as well as satisfaction, among patients electing to have a hysterectomy.","419":"In the environment of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease (PVD), there is a high risk of incisional complications following amputation, including seroma, hematoma, infection, and dehiscence. Incisional negative-pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) is a novel application of negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) that may be able to mitigate these complications and reduce the need for revisional surgery (including higher-level major lower-extremity amputations). It may also facilitate an increased rate of healing and earlier return to function. iNPWT has been used successfully in high-risk patients to decrease complications. In highly comorbid patients receiving iNPWT for primary closure of abdominal wall reconstruction, incisional infection rates were reduced from 48% to 7% (p=0.029). Furthermore, the need for revisional surgery was significantly decreased in those treated with iNPWT (48% vs.7%, p&lt;0.001), as was the rate of dehiscence (10.68% vs. 5.32%, p&lt;0.001). Major lower-extremity amputations in the multi-comorbid patient have a 16% incidence of incisional dehiscence. Additionally, the rate of infection has been reported to be as high as 22%. Five-year mortality following major lower-extremity amputation is reported to be 50% or higher. This high mortality rate is due, in part, to wound-healing complications. iNPWT can potentially reduce these healing complications and mortality. As of yet, no prospective, randomized trial has shown reduced morbidity, earlier return to function, or reduced mortality with the use of iNPWT after a lower-extremity amputation. This review presents recent findings regarding the use of iNPWT. Further studies on this topic are needed.","420":"The growth of laparoscopic surgery has increased the use of laparoscopic electrosurgical devices based on radiofrequency current. Despite an improvement in most post-operative outcomes, the use of these devices can be associated with inadvertent thermal or mechanical injuries, also called accidental punctures and lacerations (APLs). APLs can occur through either operator error or system error, including insulation failure or capacitive coupling resulting in stray energy burns. Our aim was to estimate the incidence and-as a result-the impact of laparoscopic APLs. A retrospective analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Database (SID) was performed for 2009 in California (CA) and Florida (FL). ICD-9 codes and current procedural terminology were used to query for five common general surgery procedures: appendectomy, cholecystectomy, fundoplication, gastric bypass, and gastroplasty with these procedures cross-referenced for any secondary procedure at the time of the initial surgery indicative of APLs. The c2 test was used for comparisons where appropriate. Overall, 192,794 primary laparoscopic procedures were identified in the HCUP database in CA and FL in 2009, with a similar procedure frequency distribution between CA and FL. Six hundred ninety-four procedures were complicated by APL. Gastric bypass and fundoplication were more commonly associated with APLs. In this retrospective analysis of procedures performed in CA and FL, the estimated incidence of APL was 3.6 per 1000 cases. Patient morbidity and mortality were likely related to both pilot-error injuries and stray energy burns during laparoscopy. Possible solutions to reduce surgical complications from APL include educational programs to reduce pilot error and the incorporation of fail-safe technologies to eliminate stray energy burns, such as active electrode monitoring and use of non-radiofrequency current (true cautery). ","421":"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) results in significant postoperative pain and a demanding postoperative path for recovery. This study was conducted to determine whether a femoral nerve block (FNB) or a periarticular injection of liposomal bupivacaine with an adductor canal block (LB+ACB) is superior for pain management. A total of 557 consecutive primary TKA cases performed at a single hospital between 2010-2014 were retrospectively reviewed. After enrollment criteria were met, 390 cases remained (FNB=181, LB+ACB=209). Inpatient and post-discharge variables related to pain, narcotic use, healthcare resource utilization, and cost were compared. There were no significant differences in demographics between the two groups. There was also no significant difference in inpatient postoperative pain between the two groups. The FNB group consumed fewer narcotics overall compared to the LB+ACB group (p&lt;0.001). However, the LB+ACB group experienced fewer opioid-related adverse events (p&lt;0.001). The LB+ACB group had a shorter length of stay (p&lt;.001), fewer readmissions (p=0.017) and reoperations (p=0.025), and lower costs (p&lt;0.001). LB+ACB proved to be an equally effective postoperative TKA pain management tool compared to FNB while displaying superiority in other increasingly important areas such as length of stay and cost. The larger amount of narcotic consumption is a concern, however, and there may be a small population of patients for whom LB+ACB is not the best option. ","422":"Vulvo-vaginal atrophy as a main symptom of the Genito Urinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) is a consequence of aging, particularly after menopause as a result of follicular ovarian follicle depletion and consequently low estrogen levels. Anatomical structures derived from the urogenital sinus, such as the distal urethra trigone and vestibule, are the most affected areas because of the high concentrations of alfa- and beta-estrogen receptors. The most common symptoms associated with vulvo-vaginal atrophy are dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, irritation, recurrent urinary tract infection and urinary incontinence, which negatively affect the patient's quality of life and sexuality. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate a protocol with topical growth factors that seeks to activate collagen and elastin at a molecular level, and thus restore all vaginal functions such as secretion, absorption, elasticity, lubrication and vaginal epithelium thickness.","423":"Successful joint replacement surgery requires precise preoperative planning and intraoperative placement of implants such that the function of the joint is optimized biomechanically and biologically. The five-step \"pelvic tilt algorithm\" will enhance the outcome of hip replacement surgery as a result of improved acetabular component alignment. It will solve the problem of pelvic tilt as an unknown variable during hip replacement surgery, and will allow for more consistent and accurate acetabular component placement.","424":"Rapid progress has been made with unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which are now used in a wide variety of different fields, including media, agriculture, wildlife, and infrastructure. However, the application of UAS for medical purposes, and in particular disaster relief efforts, has been slower to develop. This paper will review and present pertinent studies in the literature. Studies related to drones and medical applications for disaster relief were identified as part of a larger search regarding the civilian application of drones. A search for civilian drone applications was performed in the EBSCO (Elton B. Stephens Company) database. Non-civilian applications as well as redundant sources were excluded. The search identified 711 sources pertaining to civilian drone applications. Of these, 117 involved drone applications in disaster relief, and 28 articles specifically addressed medical uses. Drones can be useful during immediate and non-immediate medical disaster relief efforts. They can provide an instant telecommunications infrastructure, assist in telemedicine-enabled clinical services, perform equipment\/drug\/patient delivery, enhance search and rescue efforts, assess damage and map disaster zones. Rapid processing of permission for emergency operations, promotion of industry expansion, public awareness, and public participation must be emphasized for these to become routine applications. There is a major concern about the organizational umbrella that would promote this initiative. Creation of an organization such as a Drone Civil Air Patrol Wing (DCAPW) could improve our ability to provide post-disaster healthcare delivery services. ","425":"Maintaining skin integrity is benchmarked for patient safety and quality of care. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the incidence of pressure ulcers in high-risk, seriously ill patients from critical care areas comparing the number of hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) after implementation of a new silicone multi-layer foam dressing with the number of HAPIs developed during a period in the previous year within which other silicone multi-layer foam dressings were used for prevention. This study took place in three intensive care units (ICUs) including 326 patients from three community-based hospitals in Massachusetts. The cumulative incidence during the study period was 0% as opposed to 0.32% from the previous year. Multi-layer foam dressings are beneficial for pressure ulcer prevention, taking into consideration the cost-effectiveness of care and optimal patient outcomes.","426":"The advancement of surgical innovation for both devices and techniques has directly impacted the number of hysterectomy options available to patients. These advancements have led to an expansion of options that has been exceptionally impactful for minimally invasive surgery. For individuals who are diagnosed with a health condition or disease that requires a hysterectomy, these advances allow the surgeon to consider an expanded variety of procedures that may improve patients' outcomes and accommodate patient preferences. Automated suturing devices, improved energy systems, specialized mini-laparoscopic tissue handling instruments, and novel uterine manipulators, among other devices, all work together to provide hysterectomy options with cosmetically pleasing results from an aesthetic perspective. They also provide excellent medical outcomes from a surgeon's perspective. Patients are no longer subjected to large incisional scars from total abdominal hysterectomies that were commonly performed 25 years ago. All gynecological surgeons are obligated to provide patients with improved hysterectomy options that fit the indications and clinical needs of their patients. As the laparoscopic approach to a hysterectomy became the standard of care for many, variations in technique to successfully perform a laparoscopic hysterectomy has become a major limiting factor for generalists to incorporate this skillset into their practice. Maintaining the same procedural steps as the abdominal approach is one of the major hurdles that makes the transition to a laparoscopic approach more treacherous. Over 20 years of experience has shaped the McCarus hysterectomy technique described here into a safe and reproducible procedure that prioritizes the patient's aesthetic preferences while also providing optimal patient outcomes. The implementation of unique devices and instruments further expands the surgeon's technical skills and augments the procedure to make it an effective and preferable choice.","427":"A biofilm is a community of microorganisms that adhere to each other and to surfaces and secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) encasing themselves in a matrix. Biofilms are a major healthcare concern, as they can form on medical devices leading to infection. Additionally, there is growing evidence to show their ability to form in chronic wounds, which leads to delayed wound healing and inflammation. Due to a number of reasons, such as formation of the EPS resulting in sub-inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials reaching the bacterial cells, slow growth rate of bacterial cells rendering some antibiotics ineffective, and the presence of persister cells, biofilms show increased tolerance to many antimicrobials and antibiotics. Additionally, studies have started to emerge showing a link between resistance to antimicrobials and antibiotics. Cross-resistance can be attributed to a number of factors, for example, increased expression of multidrug efflux pumps that efflux a wide range of substrates and horizontal gene transfer of genetic material encoding multiple resistance genes between different species within the polymicrobial biofilm. Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat caused by multiple factors including cross-resistance, and it is a global health concern. This review focuses on current research on antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance and cross-resistance found between antimicrobials and antibiotics commonly used in woundcare to evaluate the significance of this acquired antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the review discusses the significance of antimicrobial tolerance and the role biofilms play in enhancing antibiotic resistance.","428":null,"429":"To determine if low-level intraoperative fluoroscopy usage is associated with increased complications during an initial series for an experienced surgeon transitioning to direct anterior approach (DAA) for total hip arthroplasty (THA). Subjects who underwent DAA were eligible for analysis. Inclusion criteria included the first 50 subjects who underwent DA hip arthroplasty by a single surgeon (January 2013 to December 2014). Total operating room (OR) time, fluoroscopy absorbed dose, flouoroscopy time, procedure time, and complications were collected and analyzed. Subject demographics were also collected with subjects divided by date of surgery to one of two possible groups. Simple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relation between case number and both radiation dose and fluoroscopy time. Subjects underwent DAA total hip arthroplasty (n=45). Total OR time ranged from 1.1hrs up to 2.5 hours. Surgeries required an average fluoroscopic time of 7.8 seconds, with improvement over the series of 3.7 seconds. The average radiation dose or fluoroscopy was 2.6 mrem per case. This resulted in a total estimated exposure of 127 mrem over a 23-month period. No patients suffered intraoperative or postoperative fractures or revisions. No significant difference was found for the groups by weight, age, height, and body mass index. Regression analysis yielded a statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in fluoroscopy time of 0.36 seconds per case over the 45 cases studied. An experienced single surgeon's learning curve in DAA THA can be accelerated, with proper training and technique, within a lifetime case experience less than 50 procedures. Surgeons should be aware that with proper techniques and sufficiently-experienced teams, a flattened learning curve is attainable while minimizing fluoroscopy exposure and maintaining clinical outcomes. ","430":"The aim of this study was to examine whether intracorporeal anastomosis (IA) after laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (LRH) is a safe procedure in both emergency and elective settings. A retrospective review of all consecutive adult patients (age &gt; 17 years) who underwent LRH from November 2014 to May 2018 at S. Andrea Hospital, La Spezia, was performed. The primary and secondary outcomes were the anastomotic leak rate and the operative time, respectively. Both IA and extracorporeal anastomosis (EA) were performed according to standardized techniques by the same team of experienced surgeons. Our findings were compared to literature data on recent studies comparing IA and EA during LRH. During the observation period, 167 patients underwent RH at our institution: IA was performed in 115. The mean age was 73.5 y. Thirty-three RH were performed in an emergency setting: 15 laparotomic procedures, 3 conversions from laparoscopic to open, 6 laparoscopic-assisted with EA, and 9 complete IA. The remaining 134 patients underwent elective RH: IA was performed in 106. The overall anastomotic leak rate in LHR IA was 2.6% (3\/115), and no anastomotic leak was reported in the emergency group (0\/9). The mean operative time was 180 min. In our experience, the operative time is related to the surgeon's experience and confidence with the technique, and not to the anastomosis technique per se. Consistent with the literature data, IA in LRH was associated with better outcomes than EA in both elective and emergency settings. ","431":null,"432":"A common post-operative complication of many operations is seroma formation, which, while generally considered to be relatively minor, can be problematic for patients and a drain on healthcare resources due to the need for frequent outpatient reviews and repeated aspirations. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the development of seromas, and drains have traditionally been used as a preventative strategy. However, drains are falling out of favour, not least because the evidence to support their use is limited and conflicting. In recent years, the use of quilting sutures, also known as progressive tension sutures, is starting to emerge as a favourable alternative for preventing post-operative seroma formation. Several studies and trials support their use in abdominal wall operations such as abdominoplasties and at abdominal wall donor sites in reconstructive breast operations. General surgeons perform many operations on the abdominal wall, such as ventral hernia repair, that predispose the patient to seroma formation. Can quilting sutures be used in operations on the abdominal wall to prevent seroma formation? This aim of this review was to evaluate the use of quilting sutures as described in several studies to reduce the incidence of post-operative seroma.","433":"The treatment option for inferior mesenteric arteriovenous malformations is under debate because of the number of cases. We, herein, report about a 35-year-old man with congenital inferior mesenteric artery malformation (AVM) presenting with mucous stool and severe abdominal pain. The radical operation, after building the diverting stoma, minimized the extent of the resection. This is the first reported case where surgical management was used to control severe symptoms induced by inferior mesenteric AVM.","434":"To help limit wear, newer polyethylene liners, such as the highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) liners, have been developed. These newer liners undergo an alternating irradiation process, resulting in a stronger, longer-lasting liner. The purpose of this study was to analyze the wear rates of patients who underwent THA and received a newer generation HXLPE acetabular insert. Specifically, we compared: 1) linear vector wear amount and 2) linear vector wear rates in patients as an overall cohort and by gender. We also assessed patient satisfaction outcomes comparing preoperative Harris Hip Scores (HHS) to seven-week, one-year, and three-year HHS scores. A total of 23 patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) with direct superior approach by a fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon at a private practice institution were analyzed after receiving institutional review board approval. Patients had a minimum two-year follow up, with the mean follow up being four years (range, three to five years). All patients received a 36-mm ceramic femoral head with an HXLPE liner. 2D radiographic polyethylene wear analysis was performed using the Martell Hip Analysis Suite (HAS; University of Chicago, Illinois), which has been previously validated in the literature. Outcomes were assessed using Harris Hip Scores. A five-year linear wear rate of 0.073 mm\/year (range, 0 to 0.160 mm\/year) and an overall mean linear wear rate of 0.096 mm\/year (range, 0 to 0.277 mm\/year) were found. No significant differences in wear were seen between genders. Additionally, patients reported significantly better results at seven-weeks (83 points [range, 59 to 100 points]) and one-year (94 points [range, 85 to 100 points]) than preoperative (52 points [range, 34 to 73 points]) HSS scores (p&lt;0.05). No patients underwent revision THA. The results from this study highlight the benefits of using an HXLPE polyethylene liner in THA patients and further validates previously reported wear rates of HXLPE liners. After an early \"wear in\" period during the first year, the wear rates steadily decreased over time. This liner showed excellent early outcomes as no patients underwent revision THA. Furthermore, even as early as seven postoperative weeks, patients reported significantly better HHS scores. Future studies should track the same patient cohort over time to help develop a wear-rate prediction model. ","435":"There are different levels of wound education which exist amongst healthcare providers treating wounds. It is unknown if advanced wound training can lead to improved clinical outcomes. To review and summarize existing literature focused on the impact of different healthcare professionals with advanced wound care training and the associated effect of clinical outcomes. The methods used to conduct this scoping review are based on the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. An electronic search was performed by independent reviewers using Scopus, CINAHL, PubMed, Google, and EWMA. Consensus decision-making amongst the reviewers resulted in relevant final articles being selected for review. In the literature, there is no universally accepted definition for advanced training in wound care. Seven of the eight selected articles focused on nurses with a specialization in wound healing and their impact on wound healing outcomes. The five main themes identified were wound improvement, cost savings, influence on other nurses, wound recurrence rate, and advanced education. A minimum level of advanced training or education would be beneficial to ensure consistency in the provision of advanced wound care by professionals practicing wound care. ","436":"When the original monograph on valvular prostheses was published in Surgical Technology International, back in 1993, transcatheter technology had not yet been invented. These techniques have been gradually revealed in subsequent issues. When we first considered writing a paper that described both surgical and transcatheter prosthesis, we realized that such a combined paper would be impractically large. Therefore, we decided to split our survey into more than one paper. This paper seeks to address the paucity of information available regarding transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and similar devices. This publication may serve as a reference point for critically organizing information on an evolving topic. The following article deals with the large number of transcatheter devices related to valvular and ventricular pathologies: TAVI for the aortic and mitral valves, with a focus on indications, techniques and complications, as well as specific aortic devices, and devices to treat mitral regurgitation with non-conventional access. Every effort has been made to make the content relevant and up-to-date, which proved to be particularly challenging due to the continuous technological evolution which characterizes this field.","437":"We describe our experience with transanal-laparoscopic treatment of anastomotic leakage. Anastomotic leakage leads to high mortality rates, morbidity, a complicated post-operative course and increased cost. The management of low anastomotic leakage after anterior resection of rectal cancer is not standardized. This was a retrospective cohort study based on prospectively collected data. Among patients who underwent anterior resection for rectal cancer in our division between January 2014 and October 2017, 14 developed colorectal or colo-anal anastomotic leakage and underwent reoperation with a transanal approach. Data regarding patient demographics, reoperative outcomes, morbidity, length of hospital stay, mortality, leak closure and long-term outcomes are presented. In all patients, anastomotic healing was confirmed by radiology. No perioperative complications were detected. One patient presented anastomotic stricture after 20 months, which was successfully treated with dilatation. There is little information available on the management of anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer. Although more studies are needed to standardize patient selection criteria and evaluate the long-term outcome of these procedures, minimally invasive transanal conventional and laparoscopic anastomotic leak repair is a feasible and safe surgical option that can often avoid the need for anastomotic takedown and stoma formation.

To report the outcome of a series of patients with sacral chordoma who were surgically treated at a single center. Chordomas are low-grade malignant tumors that arise from remnants of the notochord. They are most often found in the sacrum, spine and skull-base. These tumors have a slow clinical evolution and may eventually metastasize, even after adequate treatment. Rarely, they can dedifferentiate into high-grade sarcomas. Traditionally, chordomas were considered to be resistant to chemotherapy and standard radiation therapy. However, recently, adrotherapy has been shown to be effective for local and systemic control of the disease. In this study, clinical outcomes and local and systemic recurrence were reviewed to identify prognostic factors for local and systemic control. Thirty-three patients with sacral chordoma (19 males, 14 females; median age 61 y, range 43-80) who were surgically treated at our institution between 1994 and 2015 were reviewed. In 24 patients, resection was performed above S2. No patients received pre-operative radiotherapy (RT). Three cases received RT (carbon ion therapy) as treatment for local recurrence. Wide (R0) surgical margins were achieved in 17 patients, marginal (R1) margins in 14 patients and intralesional (R2) margins in 2 patients. At a median follow-up of 53 months (range 0-198), 19 patients were continuously disease-free, 6 were disease-free after local recurrence (5) or metastases (1), 3 were alive with disease (2 local recurrence and 1 metastasis), 4 were dead of disease (1 patient died intraoperatively) and 1 was dead of another cause. Local recurrence was observed in 9 cases (27%); all 9 were treated surgically and 3 received carbon ion therapy after surgical intralesional excision. Overall survival at 10 years was 86.6%. Local recurrence-free survival at 10 years was 51%. A statistical analysis confirmed the importance of negative surgical margins (R0) to achieve local control of the disease (p = 0.0007). High resections (above S2) were associated with lower survival and higher risk of local recurrence. Surgical en bloc resection is the primary treatment for sacral chordoma. Carbon ion therapy is used when it is difficult to obtain wide surgical margins. Due to morbidity and the disabling sequelae of surgery, adrotherapy may be considered an alternative to high (above S2-S3) sacral chordoma resections. ","441":"Backpacks are standard load carriers for people of all ages, especially school children and the military. Previous studies have described the impact of the forces exerted by backpacks on load distribution, back pain, and gait. The objective of this study was to use finite element analysis (FEA) to assess the effects of incremental weights in a backpack on the spine. To assess the forces experienced by the spine under the incremental addition of weight to a backpack, we performed a finite element simulation using commercially available 'BodyParts3D\/Anatomography' data, which were imported into FEA software. We studied two different scenarios: 1) a regular backpack with incrementally placed weights using both shoulder straps with the spine in a neutral position, and 2) a regular backpack with incrementally placed weights using both shoulder straps with the spine tilted forward 20 degrees. The spine model was physiologically accurate. For all of the added weights examined (1-100 pounds; 0.45-45.36 kg), the force experienced by the neutral spine was 7.2-fold the added weight. For the 20 degrees-forward posture, this value rose to 11.6-fold. These findings should help to clarify the forces experienced by the spine due to objects in a backpack. For example, this should help spinal surgeons to better understand the tremendous importance of sagittal plane alignment in planning their surgical reconstructions. ","442":"Our purpose was to assess the outcomes of those who underwent an ultrasound-guided debridement of the deposits. Specifically, we analyzed: (1) function; (2) pain; (3) activity level; (4) patient satisfaction; and (5) complications. A review of patients who underwent an ultrasound-guided debridement of calcific deposits about their shoulder joint between 2005 and 2015 was performed. Our final cohort consisted of 38 patients with a mean age of 53 years (range, 35 to 62 years)-11 men and 27 women-and a mean follow up of 32 months (range, 12 to 53 months). Functional outcomes, activity level, and pain level were assessed using the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scale, the University of Southern California (UCLA) activity scale, and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Additionally, patients were asked if they were satisfied with the outcomes of their procedure. All medical records were assessed for potential complications from this procedure. Excellent outcomes were achieved. The mean DASH score improved from 21 to 10 points (p=0.0001). Additionally, mean UCLA score increased from 2 to 7 points (p=0.0001). Furthermore, the mean reported VAS improved from 8 to 1.6 (p=0.0001). Ninety-seven percent of patients reported being satisfied. There were no reported complications in our cohort. We found that this procedure can result in effective pain relief and prevent or delay the need for more invasive procedures. Future studies should evaluate the role of calcium deposit size in the outcomes of those who undergo debridement. ","443":"Our objective was to compare intrauterine pressures during resection and aspiration modes among three types of commercially-available hysteroscopic morcellators. This was a benchtop study (Canadian Task Force level II-1). This study cannot feasibly and ethically be done in-vivo, so an ex-vivo study design was chosen. A silicone uterine model was attached to a manometer via tubing, with the tip inside the cavity to allow for intracavity pressure measurements. Each hysteroscopic morcellator was then introduced, and intracavity pressures were recorded every one to two seconds in three modes (static, resection, and aspiration) and at three set point pressures (45, 85, and 125 mmHg). No human subjects were involved in this study. None. There were a total of 4,872 pressure measurements during this study across the three devices, over the three modes, and at the three set point pressures combined. Using mixed-effects linear regression, the mean observed intracavity pressure was not greater than the set pressure for each of the three devices. This result held true in both aspiration and resection modes. In our statistical models, the coefficient on the terms representing the interaction between device and time were not statistically significant in either resection or aspiration modes. This indicates that, statistically, the change in intracavity pressure over time was not significantly different across the three devices. In this first of its kind head-to-head benchtop study, we found that all three commercially-available hysteroscopic morcellators appear to be similar to each other in terms of their abilities to maintain intracavity pressure below the set pressure, which is important in avoiding intravasation in-vivo. These findings are important because many gynecologists do not have the ability to choose between the three available devices on the market at their institution. ","444":"Endometrial ablation (EA) is the most commonly performed surgical procedure for the management of abnormal uterine bleeding unresponsive to medical therapy. In well-selected subjects, EA provides a safe, inexpensive, and convenient alternative to hysterectomy with a rapid return to normal function. The first generation of EA techniques were introduced in 1886 by Professor Sneguireff of Moscow. He was the first to apply super-heated steam to the uterine cavity to vaporize the endometrial basalis. This method-known as atmocausis-was refined by Ludwig Pincus of Danzig in 1895, and he went on to perform over 800 procedures. As the 20th century brought forth other energy sources-electricity, X-ray, radium, and even cryogenics-they were each used, in turn, to accomplish endometrial ablation. In 1981, Dr. Milton Goldrath successfully performed EA by co-locating a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser with a rod-lens hysteroscope to achieve photovaporization of the endometrium. The accomplishment of EA under direct visualization defined the second generation of EA. The challenges and risks of second-generation technology, however, was soon apparent, and though this practice continues today, it appears to be confined to a relatively small number of devoted and highly-skilled sub-specialists. The late 1990s saw increasing interest in safe, affordable, and easily-mastered EA technology. The result was a return to blind technology but modified with a variety of features that brought unprecedented safety to EA, even permitting its selected in-office application. This third generation of EA techniques and devices has propelled the growth of EA in the 21st century. Although much has been accomplished in the quest for safe, affordable, convenient, and easily-mastered EA, the future requires refinement of patient selection criteria, management strategies for late-onset endometrial ablation failures (LOEAFs), as well as minimally invasive methods for reducing them.","445":null,"446":"Robotic-assisted surgery has proved to be a valuable modality in specialties such as urology and gynecology and has gained wide acceptance in those fields. Its value in general surgery, however, has had a slower acceptance rate among surgeons. This study reviews my first 150 cases using the robot for one of the most common general surgery operations-the repair of hernias. All robotic hernia cases performed by a single surgeon were documented in an Excel? (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) spreadsheet beginning in April, 2014. Data recorded included patient diagnosis, hernia defect size, mesh type and size, console time and total operative time, as well as first assistant (fellow, resident, or none). The postoperative course was carefully reviewed through the electronic medical record to identify complications and readmissions. The average total case time was 138 minutes, while the average console time was 100 minutes. Incisional hernias made up 50.4% of the procedures, inguinal hernias-17.2%, ventral\/umbilical-9.8%, parastomal-9.2%, lumbar-5.5%, hiatal-4.9%, and spigelian-2.5%. The average defect size was 48.47cm2. Complication rates were low at 5.3%, most of which were minor. There were no mortalities. There has been one known hernia recurrence. This review shows that the use of the robot has proven to be safe and effective, and it has many benefits in hernia repair. One of those benefits is the ability to close the fascial defect with a running suture, thus avoiding the postoperative pain associated with transfascial sutures. The ability to intracorporeally fix a large piece of mesh to the abdominal wall that adequately and evenly covers the defect is another benefit. The high-quality three-dimensional view and the ability to articulate the instruments are well-established benefits of the robot as well. Robotic assistance also allows us to perform a minimally invasive hernia repair on large complex defects that would have otherwise been performed via an open approach. ","447":"Based on experience with several hundreds of adult and pediatric patients in whom the cranial bifrontal approach was used to achieve different surgical objectives, this paper describes this approach in a step-by-step manner with illustrations. This is a basic approach to the anterior cranial fossa that enables the preservation of most bridging veins. The bifrontal approach, whether basal, interhemispheric, or both, allows a wider bilateral operative field with better orientation and views of important neural structures and perforating arteries, without needing to be combined with other approaches. The following description should be regarded as a basic technique to arrive at a definite location within the anterior cranial compartment and beyond, rather than as rigid steps that must be followed rigorously. These illustrations are intended to present essential principles of a standard bifrontal approach. Since the same principles can be followed for every bifrontal approach, this technique along with the surgical results can be constantly improved.","448":"Currently, there is a wide range of commercially available endografts for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Results of long-term follow up after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are limited. Thereby, the durability of these endografts and the difference between manufacturers is not fully clear. In this review, studies with mid- and long-term results, with a minimum median follow up of 36 months per endograft, were included describing results with Cook Zenith? Flex? endograft (Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, Indiana) (n=6), Cordis Corporate INCRAFT? (Cordis Corporation, Freemont, California) (n=1), Gore? EXCLUDER? (W.L. Gore &amp; Associates Inc., Flagstaff, Arizona) (n=3), Medtronic Endurant? (Medtronic plc, Santa Rosa, California) (n= 6), and Vascutek Anaconda? (Vascutek Ltd., Inchinnan, Scotland) (n=2). The assisted technical success varied between 83% and 100%, and the perioperative mortality, early reintervention, and early conversion rates were comparable for the studied endografts. At three-year follow up, the freedom from AAA-rupture and AAA-related death varied between 98% and 100%. The results demonstrated an increasing complication and reintervention rate over time. When adhering to the instruction for use, minor differences were seen during follow up between the endografts. Latest generation endografts continue to have good postoperative results, the reintervention-rate of 10-20% over time mandates an ongoing close patient follow up. The choice of a specific design depends on native patient anatomy and the experience of the implanting surgeon.","449":"Few studies have evaluated the concomitant effect of both total knee arthroplasty (TKA) limb alignment and ligament laxity. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of lower extremity alignment on the short-term outcome (one year) following TKA, including pain relief, function, and patient satisfaction. The secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of ligament laxity and balance on early outcomes following TKA. A prospective evaluation of mechanical alignment and ligament tension was performed for 110 consecutive TKAs using an identical surgical technique. Patients were evaluated with knee society score, visual analog pain score, and satisfaction one year following TKA. Linear regression analysis was then performed to determine the effect of lower extremity alignment and ligament laxity. There was no significant relationship between lower extremity alignment and outcome measures. A significant relationship was identified between medial collateral laxity in full extension and knee society scores for function, but not for pain. There was also a significant relationship identified between lateral knee laxity at 90 degrees of flexion and knee society score and pain at one-year follow up. Our results demonstrated no correlation between mechanical alignment restoration and pain or function. However, more interestingly, this study found patients with medial laxity in extension and lateral laxity in knee flexion, similar to normal physiologic knee laxity, to have less pain and greater function and satisfaction at one-year short-term follow up. ","450":"Advances in intraoperative imaging and neuronavigation techniques have positively affected glioma surgery. The desire to reduce brain-shift-related problems while achieving the real-time identification of lesions and residual and anatomical relationships has strongly supported the introduction of intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) in neuro-oncological surgery. This paper presents tips based on our experience with ioUS in neurosurgery. We retrospectively analyzed 264 patients who underwent high-grade glioma (HGG) resection at the University of Turin and 60 patients who were treated at the University of Rome. The main issues are the correct choice of the probe and how to evaluate the anatomy to understand how the information from the three common US planes (axial, sagittal and coronal plane) can be used in each case. It is also important to correctly identify anatomical structures in ioUS imaging. In a normal brain, the sulci, sickle, tentorium, choroid plexus, ependyma and the walls of the vessels are all hyperechoic. In addition, some structures are hypoechoic with a homogeneous acoustic gradient: ventricles, cysts and everything that contains liquor. Tumors are usually hyperechoic in ioUS because of their higher cellularity. Conversely, acute edema that contains fluid is hypoechoic, while chronic edema is hyperechoic. IoUS is a real-time, accurate and inexpensive imaging method. The difficulties of interpretation can be overcome by experience in US imaging and a better understanding of the interaction between navigation and imaging fusion techniques. Training on a large number of cases is important for the correct assessment of ioUS information to obtain valuable, real-time information during HGG surgery. ","451":"We report a patient who presented with multiple rib fractures after falling off a horse and was initially managed medically. Several weeks later, the patient returned to the hospital complaining of dyspnea on exertion. Physical exam revealed severe chest wall malformation and imaging revealed moderate hemothorax and complete collapse of the right lower lobe. Considering the likelihood that this patient's multiple ribs fractures contributed to the hemothorax and trapped lung, the patient underwent surgical evacuation of the hemothorax followed by rib fixation of ribs three through six. The procedures were performed using both intra-thoracic and extra-thoracic video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and did not require the use of thoracotomy incision or open exposure of the thoracic cavity. This case report suggests that this operative technique is a viable option for delayed presentation of multiple rib fractures and complex sequela associated with this pathology.","452":"Anal fissure is a common proctological condition that is usually defined as an anodermal ulcerative process starting from the posterior commissure to the dentate line. The objective of this study was to evaluate the resolution rate of anal fissure through the use of conservative management in patients grouped according to our newly proposed classification. A secondary purpose was to quantify the recurrence rates at 2-years follow-up in each group. A retrospective analysis was carried out on patients in our general database. Diagnosis was based on symptoms, clinical observation, anal manometry and transanal ultrasounds. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients were assigned to different groups. Follow-up was carried out at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. A total of 136 patients (54 female and 82 male) were included in the statistical analysis. At the end of the treatment period, all patients in groups 1 and 2 had a complete resolution of illness and a normal basal sphincterial tone, while those in groups 3 and 4 had a higher rate of recurrence at the 2-year follow-up. Based on our series, we propose a definitive non-surgical management for all group 1 and 2 anal fissures according to our protocol. For groups 3 and 4, we recommend a primary non-surgical approach with follow-up. This was a retrospective study and further randomized controlled studies will be necessary to confirm our results. ","453":"Regardless of the surgical approach used, dislocation remains a complication following total hip replacement. In recent years, newer technologies, such as the use of large femoral heads, have reduced the rate of postoperative dislocation. The combination of such technology, together with a soft tissue repair technique, may reduce the dislocation rate even further. A single surgeon performed 513 primary total hip replacements on 505 patients using a posterior approach utilizing a technique designed to spare the capsule. There were 257 males and 248 females. Age ranged from 39 to 92 years. Surgeries were performed from January 2012 to December 2015. Implants used were cementless dual-mobility cups and cementless femoral stems. In all cases, the posterior capsule was incised and retracted, but not excised. Following implant placement, the capsule was repaired using a fiber reinforced suture. The superior border of the capsular incision, just above the piriformis, was sutured to the superior capsule or gluteus minimus muscle. The intent of this repair was to completely incarcerate the femoral head. Patients were followed at two weeks, six weeks, three months, one year, three years, and five years. Follow up was one to five years post-implantation. The dislocation rate was zero. The combination of a large dual-mobility femoral head, combined with a soft tissue repair that spares the deep capsule, has the potential to significantly reduce dislocation rates when using the posterior approach to the hip.","454":"Leakage of the anastomosis after colonic\/rectal surgery is a serious complication. One of the most important causes of anastomotic leakage is impaired vascularization. A microvascular tissue deficit is very often not intraoperatively de visu detectable under white light. Near-infrared indocyanine green (ICG)-enhanced fluorescence is a cutting-edge technology that may be useful for detecting microvascular impairment and potentially preventing anastomotic leakage. The aim of this narrative review was to evaluate the feasibility and the usefulness of intraoperative assessment of vascular anastomotic perfusion in colorectal surgery using an indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent tracer. A PubMed\/MedLine, Embase, and Scopus narrative literature review was performed, in which \"colorectal surgery\" and \"indocyanine green\" were used as key words. The inclusion criteria were 1) manuscripts written in English; 2) full text is available; 3) topic related to the use of ICG fluorescence for the assessment of tissue perfusion during laparoscopic or robotic colorectal surgery; and 4) sample: adult patients, benign or malignant disease. Exclusion criteria included 1) case reports; 2) topic not related to the use of ICG fluorescence for the evaluation of tissue perfusion during laparoscopic or robotic colorectal surgery; 3) manuscripts that focused solely on other applications of ICG technology; and 4) any study type not showing original data. Results and Critical Discussion: The intraoperative visual assessment of tissue viability under white light may lead to an underestimation of microvascular blood flow impairment. ICG can be safely used in cases of minimally invasive colonic surgery and also low anterior resections. This technology may be useful when deciding whether to intraoperatively change a previously planned resection\/anastomotic level, which could decrease theoretically the occurrence of anastomotic leakage. Near-infrared ICG technology is a very useful approach. Multiple preliminary studies suggest that this technique may be used to predict anastomotic leakage. However, evaluation of the ICG signal is still too subjective. Some reliable scoring\/grading parameters related to the ICG signal need to be defined. Additionally, more prospective, randomized, and adequately powered studies are required to completely reveal the true potential of this surgical technological innovation. ","455":"Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) fixation of neck of femur fractures is one of the most commonly performed orthopaedic trauma operations. Changes in working practices have impacted surgical training and have resulted in fewer opportunities to perform this procedure. Virtual reality (VR) simulation has been shown to be a valid means of gaining competency, efficiently and safely, without compromising patient safety. The aim of this study is to determine whether performance on a VR DHS simulator correlates with performance in the operating theatre. All episodes of DHS fixation of neck of femur fractures performed at Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, level 1 major trauma centre between January 2014 and December 2015 were identified using the hip fracture database. The primary surgeon was identified using the electronic operative notes. The intraoperative fluoroscopic images were accessed and the tip-apex distance (TAD) was measured, as well as the probability of cut-out. The surgeon then performed DHS fixation on a VR DHS simulator and the TAD achieved in theatre was correlated with the simulated TAD. Twenty-five surgeons, including six novices (core surgical trainees), 12 intermediates (specialist registrars), and seven experts (fellows and consultants), completed the study. There was no overall statistically significant difference in TAD between those achieved in the operating theatre and on the simulator for each participant (p=0.688). There is no significant difference between performance on a VR DHS simulator and the operating theatre. This suggests that the simulator is excellent for training in this component of the DHS procedure, but further work is needed to assess whether training on the simulator can improve performance in the operating theatre.

In this study, our organization-a group of private practices partnering with a consultant-aimed to analyze the impact of a preoperative protocol on overall cost savings. Using administrative data from the Medicare Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative, 771 consecutive total joint arthroplasty patients from 2009-2014 were compared with 408 consecutive BPCI patients from 2014-2017. The 30-day episode and Medicare part B total cost of care was analyzed. This included inpatient and post-discharge expenditure, laboratory and imaging costs, physician and ER visits, and readmission. Average total episode cost declined by $3,174 or 13% from $23,925 to $20,752 (p&lt;0.001) in the BPCI period. Readmission rate was unchanged (p=0.20), and there was a 48% reduction in the percent of patients presenting to the emergency room (p=.03). There was a decline of $2,647 (78%) in skilled nursing cost per case, which represented the majority of savings. Post-discharge imaging, laboratory test claims, postoperative emergency room visits, primary care physician (PCP) visits, and cost per episode all decreased. The decrease in PCP utilization did not result in increased medical complications or readmissions. Our preoperative patient-education protocol has decreased non-home discharge, unnecessary postoperative physician visits, and diagnostic testing resulting in an episode cost savings of 13%. With Advanced BPCI on the horizon, orthopedic surgeon control as the awardee of the bundle, combined with an increasing focus on patient education, will continue to lower costs and improve patient care. ","459":"Limited internal rotation (IR) remains a concern for activities of daily living (ADLs) following bilateral shoulder arthroplasty (BSA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the loss of the ability to perform functional IR tasks following BSA using various combinations of anatomic (TSA) and reverse (RSA) shoulder arthroplasty. A retrospective review of an institutional shoulder-surgery database was conducted for patients who underwent BSA with any combination of TSA or RSA with at least a 2-year follow-up. IR range of motion (ROM) and individual American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) questions specific to IR were used to assess a patient's ability to perform IR tasks with at least one of their shoulders. Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria (47 TSA\/TSA, 17 RSA\/RSA, and 9 TSA\/RSA). Average age at surgery was 72.1 years. Average follow-up was 51.4 months. Loss of ability to wash one's back was observed in 30.4% TSA\/TSA, 33.3% TSA\/RSA, and 52.9% RSA\/RSA. Loss of ability to tuck in a shirt was observed in 10.6% TSA\/TSA, 11.1% TSA\/RSA, and 29.4% RSA\/RSA. Loss of ability to manage toileting was observed in no TSA\/TSA or TSA\/RSA, but in 11.8% RSA\/RSA. For each of the tasks, there were no significant differences in the ability to perform the task among the groups (p&gt;0.05). Post-operative IR ROM for TSA\/TSA was superior to those for TSA\/RSA and RSA\/RSA (p&lt;0.01). IR ROM efficacies for both RSA\/RSA and TSA\/RSA were inferior to that for TSA\/TSA (p&lt;0.05). Bilateral RSA patients can perform most IR tasks, and their ability to complete these tasks does not differ significantly from those in patients with other BSA. ","460":"Surgical technique in total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been a topic of debate over the last 50 years. Evidence-based studies are needed to compare one technique to another. This study investigated the outcome of the direct superior approach in primary THA as measured by patient perception of pain and recovery over a 16-year period. We retrospectively reviewed a series of 3,357 consecutive patients who underwent primary THA by a single surgeon using the direct superior approach between 2001 and 2017. The surgical technique was modified twice during this 16-year period. The first modification (2007) consisted of piriformis tendon preservation. The second modification (2012) consisted of iliotibial band (ITB) preservation. These two modifications of the surgical technique created three different patient groups. A telephone interview regarding patient pain and recovery after each THA was conducted with 147 patients who had staged bilateral THA procedures wherein the surgical technique was modified between the first and second (contralateral) THA. Results show the addition of ITB preservation to capsular repair, with or without piriformis preservation, greatly improves the patient's perception of pain and recovery, causing the majority of patients to prefer their ITB-preserving surgery over their ITB-sacrificing surgery. In addition, the dislocation rate over this 16-year period is 0.17%. The direct superior approach to the hip results in excellent stability with a dislocation rate of 0.17%. The patient's perception of pain and recovery is dramatically improved with preservation of the iliotibial band.

Although some inconsistencies have been reported, anatomic studies demonstrated that the ALL runs on the lateral side of the knee from the femoral lateral epicondyle area to the proximal tibia, between Gerdy's tubercle and the fibula head. Histologic research has characterized the ALL structure, which is more than a simple capsular thickening; it shows a dense collagen core, typical bony insertions and mechanoreceptor function. An analysis of biomechanical properties suggests that the ALL is weaker than other knee ligaments. While its contributions to tibial anterior translation control and to a high grade on the Pivot-Shift test are still unclear, there is a consensus that the ALL controls tibial internal rotation. Further research will be needed to clarify the significance of ALL injuries and to gauge the value of combined ACL and ALL reconstructions.","464":"Lower extremity total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is one of the most successful orthopaedic procedures. However, it is estimated that as many as 10% to 20% of TJAs could fail due to various well-known causes. Furthermore, metal allergy-related complications have recently gained attention as one of the potential causes of failure when the common reasons have been excluded. Reported symptoms from metal allergy can include chronic eczema, joint effusions, joint pain, and limited range of motion. Few studies have explored the outcomes of patients undergoing revisions due to allergic complications. The aim of our study is to quantitatively evaluate the outcomes of revision joint arthroplasty due to metal allergy and hypersensitivity.","465":"There are large variations in the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), and outpatient hysterectomy (OP) among Medicare patients according to hospital surgical volume and geographical distribution. To explore the changing trend in OP and MIS hysterectomy in the United States. We used all Medicare fee-for-service claims data for 2012 and 2014 to determine the incidence of OP and MIS hysterectomy according to hospital surgical volume and geographical distribution. MIS included both laparoscopy and robotic surgery. OP procedures included only same-day discharge hysterectomies. A total of 55,562 and 53,054 hysterectomies were performed in the years 2012 and 2014, respectively. OP rate in 2014 in high-volume centers (16,828 [47.1%]) exceeded low-volume centers (136 [16%]) by 31.1% (p&lt;0.001). Time trends between 2014 and 2012 show that a rise in OP rate was 17.7% and 7% for high- and low-volume hospitals (p&lt;0.001), respectively. High-volume hospitals showed an increase of 3.1% (p=0.003) in MIS hysterectomy rate in 2014 (69%) as compared to 2012 (65.9%). There was no change in MIS rate among low-volume hospitals. In the Medicare population, the rate of OP and MIS hysterectomy for high-volume centers is significantly different form low-volume centers. Over the years, outpatient hysterectomy is being practiced widely but an increase in MIS rate is limited to high-volume centers.

The individual patient's anatomic characteristics, like an exceptionally large left liver lobe, fatty mesentery with limited mobile Roux limb, difficulty in positioning a stapler, etc., can greatly increase the technical difficulty of this procedure. Challenging situations in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery can be classified according to the intraoperative complexity. According to this classification scheme, all patients in laparoscopic linear-stapled gastric bypass can be classified into one of four types: Type I - ideal. Surgery is straightforward, and every operative technique is relatively routine. Type II - less-than-ideal. Some minor technical difficulties may occur; some operative techniques can be more difficult than others. Type III - problematic. Difficult, with some operative techniques considerably more difficult than others. Type IV - very difficult. Every operative step is very difficult. The goal of this article is to analyze the steps of laparoscopic linear-stapled RYGB with regard to personal experience and the classification of intraoperative complexity.","469":"Seroma is a common postoperative finding after ventral hernia repair with an incidence of 20%.

In particular, radial access has traditionally been more favored for coronary interventions; its use in the aortoiliac and lower extremity vasculature has been constrained by the length of devices and the size of sheaths required. However, with increasing catheter shaft lengths, in addition to new thin-walled sheaths allowing for downsizing, the ability to perform transradial interventions on infrainguinal and infrageniculate vessels has been more readily facilitated.

We present an overview of this topic along with suggestions for joint preservation treatment of similar patients at higher risk for perioperative fracture.","475":"D3 extended mesenterectomy (D3EM) for right colon cancer has received increased attention owing to suggested improvement of oncological outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proficiency-based progression of content-valid metrics in a cadaveric model for right colectomy with D3EM. Three expert surgeons were enrolled. Surgeon one performed the procedure robotically and surgeons two and three performed open D3EM. Proficiency-based progression was recorded for eight content-valid outcomes. The superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and artery were cannulated by independent observers to evaluate vascular tears. The specimens were analyzed for lymph node harvest by a pathologist blinded to surgical access and to the surgeon. Operating times did not differ among surgeons (50.2, 32.4 and 43.7 min). SMV tears occurred in procedures A and B only. There was no significant progression in lymph node harvest for D2 (p=0.913) and D3EM (p=0.264). Cadaveric training in D3EM was associated with progression in avoidance of vascular tears with no significant changes in operating time and lymph node harvest. ","476":"Vaginal laxity and atrophy are caused mainly by aging and vaginal childbirth, which lead to a loss of strength and flexibility within the vaginal wall. As a result, women may experience vaginal, pelvic, sexual and urinary symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel radiofrequency (RF) device for internal and external vaginal treatment. Thirty women who had been diagnosed with symptoms of vaginal laxity and pelvic relaxation received a single treatment that consisted of continuous RF in the internal genitalia and continuous RF followed by fractional RF in the external vulva. Three different treatment conditions were examined. The results were evaluated by questionnaires and photos at two months post-treatment compared to baseline. For all parameters that were scored in the questionnaires, including vaginal symptoms, sexual matters, quality of life, pelvic floor impact and Stress Urinary Incontinence, significant improvements were found at a 2-month follow-up, compared to baseline (p&lt;0.001). No significant or unexpected adverse events were noted. The present results suggest that this novel RF-based device with continuous and fractional RF technologies is useful, safe and effective for treating vaginal relaxation and atrophy symptoms. ","477":null,"478":"Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and continues to be the leading cause of death for both men and women, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of all lung cancer cases. Once a lung mass is visualized on imaging, accurate staging is required for determination of treatment options and, when possible, surgical resection is recommended as it has been proven to have the best survival rates versus non-surgical treatment. If a patient has advanced or metastatic disease, therapeutic options include chemotherapy and radiation, while immunotherapy and specific agents that target tumor mutations are only recommended for appropriate candidates. Additionally, surgical options differ based on whether the tumor is peripherally or centrally located in the lung parenchyma. This article will review relevant literature concerning current surgical techniques for resection of centrally located NSCLC using thoracotomy and will emphasize the benefits and challenges of a video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) approach.","479":"Arthrofibrosis remains a major complication following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that negatively impacts patient outcomes and exhausts healthcare resources. The use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has demonstrated the ability to facilitate quadriceps muscle recovery and reduce pain. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare TKA patients who received physical therapy (PT) and adjuvant NMES therapy versus physical therapy alone in terms of: 1) rates of manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) to treat arthrofibrosis; and 2) post-therapy range of motion (ROM). This was a retrospective review of TKA patients from multiple institutions who underwent physical therapy versus physical therapy and adjuvant NMES therapy following primary TKA. A total of 206 patients were reviewed in the two cohorts that either received PT alone (n=86) or PT and adjuvant NMES therapy (n=120). Data regarding the requirement of MUA postoperatively for treatment of arthrofibrosis were collected for every patient. Additionally, pre- and post-therapy knee ROM data was also collected. Outcomes in both cohorts were then compared and analyzed. Lower rates of arthrofibrosis requiring MUA were recorded in patients who used NMES therapy and PT when compared to PT alone (7.5% vs. 19.8%; p=0.009). Log regression analysis revealed lower odds of needing MUA in patients who utilized NMES therapy in adjunct with PT (odds ratio [OR]=0.36; 95% CI: 0.115 to 0.875; p=0.023). Patients who received the NMES therapy were shown to have a statistically greater mean improvement in ROM when compared to those patients who did not receive NMES (+2.63, p=0.04). Log regression analysis also demonstrated that post-PT ROM decreased the odds of receiving MUA with a larger ROM (OR=92; 95% CI: 0.824 to 0.9855; p&lt;0.001). This study demonstrated that the use of NMES during PT may reduce the incidence of arthrofibrosis and improve patient ROM. Prospective, randomized controlled, and larger-scale studies are needed to validate these results. Nevertheless, this novel report demonstrated the positive outcomes for a new application of the NMES therapy. ","480":"Due to advances in neoadjuvant therapies and preoperative imaging modalities, joint-sparing resections have become appealing in bone tumor surgery. However, the intercalary reconstruction of metadiaphyseal bone defects of the femur and the tibia after juxta-articular tumor resection remains challenging. Both biological and prosthetic reconstructions have been used for joint-sparing resections, but little is known about the long-term outcome of these procedures. The authors reviewed a consecutive series of 64 patients treated with joint-sparing intercalary resection and reconstruction with bone grafts. Inclusion criteria were an osteotomy line within 5 cm from the knee and ankle joint surface and an osteotomy line proximal to 1 cm below the lesser trochanter at the hip level. Intra-epiphyseal resection was performed in 25 patients (39%)and intercalary resection was performed in 39 (61%). Reconstruction included 49 allograft + vascularized fibular graft (VFG), 10 allografts, and 5 VFG + structural allogenic grafts. At a mean follow-up of 117 months (range 12-305), 51 patients (80%) were continuously disease-free, and 6 showed no evidence of disease after treatment of local recurrence or metastatic lesion. One patient was alive with lung metastases at 26 months of follow-up and six patients died of disease. In the entire series of 64 patients, 26 had a non-oncological complication that required surgical revision (40.6%). Overall survival (OS) of reconstruction was 92% at 5 years and 90% at 10 and 15 years. Limb salvage survival (LSS) was 94% at 5, 10 and 15 years. Twenty-two fractures occurred in 17 patients (26.5%). There were a total of nine non-unions (14%). Six patients (9.3%) presented early wound dehiscence (average 1.8 months, range 0-6). A deep infection occurred in 3 cases (4.7 %). In 12 patients treated with VGF reconstruction (12\/54:22%), a donor-site complication was observed. The overall Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) functional score in 54 evaluable patients, who were alive with reconstruction in situ, was 27 points (range 18-30). Biologic intercalary reconstructions with bone grafts resulted in effective joint-sparing resections of the lower limb, allowing joint preservation in all but one case who required a total knee replacement for varus osteoarthritis. Despite the high rate of complications requiring surgical revision, at 15 years, overall survival of the reconstruction was 90% and limb salvage survival was 94%. In our experience, revision-free survival was better with VFG reconstruction than with allograft alone and the combination of VFG and allogenic graft seems to favor spontaneous fracture-healing and to decrease the non-union rate.","481":null,"482":"Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication that is associated with delayed recovery, prolonged length of hospital stay, exorbitant cost, and mortality. The present prospective longitudinal study aimed to evaluate the relationships between the microbial load of trocars used in laparoscopic gynecological surgery, microbiota in surgical sites, and SSI. The final sample consisted of 24 patients, including 68 swab samples and 48 trocars. Microorganisms were recovered in 100.0% of the swabs collected from the umbilicus and vaginal fornix and in 58.3% (14\/24) of the swabs collected from skin at the left McBurney's point. Most of the samples collected from trocars (87.5%) did not exhibit bacterial growth, suggesting proper disinfection. In addition, antisepsis was effective for decolonization of the skin to create an aseptic surgical field.","483":null,"484":"A number of non-operative treatment options are commonly prescribed for patients presenting with degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee, where surgery is not yet recommended. However, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the comparative effectiveness of these treatment options to best inform both patients and providers. This study examined the comparative effectiveness of a home exercise program versus bracing or a combination of the two (brace-only, exercise-only, and brace and exercise cohorts) on the following: 1) objective functional measures (quadriceps muscle strength, Self-Paced Walk Test [SPWT], and Timed \"Up &amp; Go\" [TUG] Test); 2) subjective functional measures (Lower Extremity Function Scale [LEFS] and Health Survey [VR-12] outcomes); 3) pain using Visual Analog Scale [VAS-10]; 4) patient metrics (patient treatment preference, perceptions, and compliance); and 5) progression to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) over a 12-week period. Subjects exhibited significant improvements from baseline on all measures regardless of group assignment; however, the only significant difference between groups was the larger improvement in pain scores between the brace-only and the exercise-only cohorts (p = 0.022). The brace-only regimen may be more efficacious; however, larger studies are needed to confirm this. These findings suggest that patients who are provided with either treatment option may be able to achieve a better quality of life and return to activity that may delay an elective joint arthroplasty surgery.","485":"Due to the differences in bone morphology between demographics such as age, gender, body mass index, and ethnicity, the development of orthopaedic implants requires a large number of anatomical data from various patient populations. In an effort to assess these demographic variations, Stryker Orthopaedic Modeling and Analytics (SOMA) has been developed. SOMA is a suite of tools which utilizes a comprehensive database of computed tomography scans (CT-scans), plus associated three-dimensional (3D) bone models, allowing the user to assess population differences in bone morphology, bone density, and implant fit for the purposes of research and development. Several additional software tools are currently in development to further analyze bone density and have the potential to enhance component fit. These tools, in combination with the database, have been previously utilized for development of many implant designs and techniques in hip and knee arthroplasty, as well as in trauma surgery.","486":"In recent years, more women are undergoing renal transplantation as a treatment for end-stage renal disease. Women with kidney transplants are prone to certain gynecologic issues which might necessitate hysterectomy. Laparoscopic hysterectomy can safely be performed in patients with prior unilateral or bilateral renal transplantation. Laparoscopy offers magnification of anatomy, decreased wound-related problems, and continuation of immunosuppression therapy. We present a case report and review of the literature for total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy for a patient with prior bilateral renal transplant.","487":null,"488":"Iatrogenic ureteral injuries are a source of major concern among surgeons performing colorectal procedures. Although they are uncommon, these lesions lead to severe morbidity and long-term functional disabilities, as well as an increase in mortality, hospital stay, and cost. The laparoscopic approach has gained popularity in the field of colorectal surgery and is associated with improved global postoperative outcomes. However, it is also considered to increase the risk of ureteral injury when compared to open surgery, especially during left colonic and rectal resections. To overcome these difficulties, surgical techniques have been improved over time through standardization of both open and laparoscopic procedures. However, these techniques are not infallible, and, in difficult cases, instrumental aids such as preoperative ureteral stenting may be used. To substitute the reduced haptic feedback in laparoscopic surgery, lighted stents have been developed. Unfortunately, prophylactic stenting, whether standard or lighted, is also associated with its own morbidity and its benefit-risk ratio remains highly controversial. To enhance the surgeon's visualization capabilities, augmented reality technologies have been developed. Near-infrared fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging are two promising techniques, which have been tested both in the preclinical and clinical settings. Early results show that these technologies could improve our ability to identify and protect the ureters, although technical limitations remain to be solved. Reviewing the current literature, this article aims to evaluate pre- and intraoperative techniques to identify the ureters and potentially to avoid iatrogenic injury. In addition, future trends are explored.","489":null,"490":"This report provides a brief overview of the basic principles, recent advances, and recommendations for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in adults. Approaches that avoid neurological, cardiac and peripheral vascular complications have been developed. In addition, TAVR can be performed in intermediate- and low-risk patients. However, these procedures require specialized training and may not allow for complete resolution of the underlying issue. Even if cardiologists learn to perform the procedure and despite advancements in device technology, TAVR is still susceptible to structural valve degeneration, thrombosis and late cerebral embolization. To date, TAVR has shown no consistent advantage over surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in intermediate- and low-risk patients.","491":"Endometriosis-related ascites is rare and is frequently confused with an ovarian malignancy. Since it affects women in reproductive age, its diagnosis and therapy are even more challenging. These patients usually present with abdominal distension, pelvic pain, and weight loss, but a careful questioning usually reveals the typical endometriosis symptoms-such as dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. We present three cases of endometriosis-related ascites, one of them with pleural effusion. All cases were associated with extensive disease and required laborious laparoscopic surgery, medical therapy with gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs, and long-term follow-up. One of the patients delivered twins following an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle without recurrence of ascites. We aim to raise awareness toward the importance of considering endometriosis in a patient with ascites of unknown origin.","492":null,"493":"Endometrial ablation (EA) is a commonly performed minimally invasive technique to manage intractable uterine bleeding that is unresponsive to medical therapy. It originated in ancient times when chemical astringents were used to control uterine hemorrhage associated with childbirth and a variety of other gynecologic conditions. In the late 19th century, the use of astringents and chemical cauterants gave way to the application of a variety of thermal energy technologies to cause selective destruction of the endometrium. These energy sources-steam, electricity, and even gamma rays-were applied blindly and were, by all accounts, quite effective at a time when hysterectomy was unsafe, infrequent, and generally unavailable. With the emergence of improved optics and laser and video technology in the late 20th century, a resurgence of interest in endometrial ablation began-coinciding with a time when hysterectomy was commonly performed in developed countries. Endometrial ablation underwent a revolutionary change as physicians searched for new techniques to perform selective endometrial destruction under direct visual-hysteroscopic-control. In this first of a two-part series, we will explore the first and second generations of endometrial ablation to understand how this procedure has evolved into its present status and what issues remain to be solved.","494":null,"495":"The number of robotic surgical procedures has been increasing worldwide. It is important to maximize the cost-effectiveness of robotic surgical training and safely reduce the time needed for trainees to reach proficiency. The use of preliminary lab training in robotic skills is a good strategy for the rapid acquisition of further, standardized robotic skills. Such training can be done either by using a simulator or by exercises in a dry or wet lab. While the use of an actual robotic surgical system for training may be problematic (high cost, lack of availability), virtual reality (VR) simulators can overcome many of these obstacles. However, there is still a lack of standardization. Although VR training systems have improved, they cannot yet replace experience in a wet lab. In particular, simulated scenarios are not yet close enough to a real operative experience. Indeed, there is a difference between technical skills (i.e., mechanical ability to perform a simulated task) and surgical competence (i.e., ability to perform a real surgical operation). Thus, while a VR simulator can replace a dry lab, it cannot yet replace training in a wet lab or operative training in actual patients. However, in the near future, it is expected that VR surgical simulators will be able to provide total reality simulation and replace training in a wet lab. More research is needed to produce more wide-ranging, trans-specialty robotic curricula.","496":"The original monograph on valvular prostheses in Surgical Technology International was published in 1993. It represents a milestone and a reference point for critically organizing information on a complex and rapidly evolving topic. The last update was published in 2010. Since then, there have been significant developments regarding both \"traditional\" surgical prosthesis and valves for transcatheter implantation. Both bioprostheses and mechanical prostheses continue to evolve with respect to both their design and materials to further optimize hemodynamics and prevent a patient-prosthesis mismatch. Each type of prosthesis has its own Achilles's heel: limited durability leading to structural failure for bioprostheses, and the need for anticoagulation for mechanical prostheses. After a long period of only marginal improvements, new techniques for tissue preservation and manufacturing seem to have placed surgeons on the verge of a minor revolution regarding bioprostheses. In addition, in the realm of mechanical prostheses, the many promises of silicon-free pyrolitic carbon still need to be confirmed, while an extremely cautious approach with new anticoagulants has left patients out of the non-dose-adjusted revolution, which has radically improved the quality of life of other patients, such as those suffering from atrial fibrillation. On the other hand, transcatheter therapies are maturing, and the next few years will probably see an even stronger shift in the treatment of patients away from surgical theaters to cath labs, or perhaps to a new mixed theater (which could lead to a new mixed surgeon\/catheter expert professional). This paper provides device descriptions and images of the technologies that are considered to be predominant, at least for the moment, to help orient surgeons and to serve as a reference for students. This report would not have been possible without the prior work of Profs. Denton Cooley and Eric Jamieson.","497":"Although there are studies regarding immunosuppressed patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for inflammatory arthritis or osteonecrosis, there is a paucity of studies evaluating immunosuppressed patients undergoing TKA for diagnoses other than these. We identified all patients undergoing primary TKA for osteoarthritis from 2008-2014 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database. Overall, 111,624 patients were included. The immunosuppressed group consisted of 3,466 patients, and the control group included 108,158. Outcomes measured included operative time, lengths-of-stay, discharge destination, and 30-day complication rates. Univariate analysis was used to compare the outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis was then applied to determine if immunosuppression was an independent risk factor for differences in outcomes. Immunosuppressant use did not change operative time, lengths-of-stay, or discharge disposition. Immunosuppressed patients were at higher risks of developing the following surgical and medical complications: organ\/space surgical site infection (SSI), wound dehiscence, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and systemic sepsis. Return to the operating room and 30-day readmission were also significantly higher in the immunosuppressed group. Patients taking chronic immunosuppressants and undergoing TKA for osteoarthritis are at higher risk of specific surgical and medical complications. These complications include organ\/space SSI, wound dehiscence, DVT, pneumonia, UTI, and systemic sepsis. In addition, these patients were at increased odds of returning to the operating room and being readmitted. ","498":null,"499":"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) effectively improves pain and function associated with isolated compartmental knee arthritis. The developments of computer-navigated and robotic-assisted UKA are among the most significant changes that have improved patient outcomes. This study aimed to systematically review the literature to identify differences between computer-navigated and robotic-assisted UKAs. Twenty total articles were identified. Data pertaining to demographics, outcomes, and complications\/failures were extracted from each study. Reoperation\/revision rates, indications for reoperation\/revision, type of procedure, and number of patients who underwent conversion to TKA (when available) were recorded. Nine studies reported 451 computer-navigated medial UKAs, with 19 (3.9%) reportedly requiring reoperation: primary revision (n=8; 42.1%), conversion to TKA (n=6), and manipulation under anesthesia (n=5). Eleven studies reported 2,311 robotic-assisted UKAs (74 lateral UKAs), with 106 (5.0%) requiring reoperation: conversion to TKA (n=46; 43.4%), primary revision (n=43), reoperations without component-removal (n=15), subchondroplasty, and partial meniscectomy\/synovectomy (both n=1). Reoperation rate discrepancy between computer-navigated and robotic-assisted UKA was not statistically significant (p=0.495); age and BMI differed between both groups (p&lt;0.0001). This study represents the first known comparison of revision rates of computer-navigated and robotic-assisted UKA, suggesting that these methods can benefit orthopaedic surgeons, especially those new to UKA or in a low-volume practice. ","500":"Rapidly evolving advances in wound-care technologies and treatment modalities, including locally injectable granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), are increasingly being used. Based on its role in the stimulation and recruitment of key contributors to wound healing, such as keratinocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts, GM-CSF is considered to play an essential role in the wound-healing cascade. Synthetic GM-CSF has been shown to have a positive effect on the healing of chronic wounds when given as a local injection in a small number of patients. Subsequent randomized, controlled trials demonstrated that GM-CSF accelerated the healing of chronic wounds. This paper reviews the proposed mechanism of action of GM-CSF in wound healing. We also describe its method of application in the operating room at a tertiary care center for patients with wounds. Key Messages: Many types of chronic wounds have an altered keratinocyte and macrophage function that can be potentially assuaged by the addition of locally injected growth factor therapy to standard-of-care treatment. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of chronic, non-healing wounds. This article reviews the data on GM-CSF, reports a proposed mechanism of action, and describes its use by a team of wound surgeons.","501":"Diabetes Mellitus is a serious systemic illness that has an epidemic-like increasing prevalence in the United States, as well as the rest of the world. With the increasing number of people with diabetes comes the higher incidence of diabetes-related complications. One of these known complications, diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), has an estimated lifetime incidence of 15% in diabetics. Having a DFU increases the risk of infection, amputation, and even death, which is why prompt treatment and surveillance of such ulcers is imperative. Multiple organizations and journals have recently published best practices to heal and close DFU. Despite these guidelines, it is estimated that only 50% of all diabetic foot ulcers close within one year in the United States. To further confuse this picture, many trials include postoperative wounds that behave in a very different way than chronic wounds. The management of diabetic ulcers requires an understanding of not only the pathophysiology along with a multi-modal approach involving local wound care, pressure prevention, infection control, and, in some, revascularization, but also how care is delivered in the United States presently. In this review, we hope to elucidate the current knowledge and modalities used in ulcer management and to focus on key areas and best practices to inform the clinician, both in what they should do and what they can do.","502":"Although there has been a recent increase in the use of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery, the percentage of patients who undergo surgery using entirely minimally invasive techniques is still quite low, and there are substantial differences among centers. It has been argued that the limiting factor in the use of laparoscopic procedures is not the tumor or patient characteristics, but rather the number of surgeons with adequate skills to perform an entirely laparoscopic colectomy. To address this issue, we report here our totally laparoscopic right colectomy technique, with particular focus on a new way to perform the enterotomy closure, which may simplify ileocolic anastomosis.","503":"Anastomotic leakage is a severe complication after colonic\/rectal surgery. One of the most important causes of anastomotic leakage is poor vascular supply. However, microvascular impairment at the anastomotic site is very often not detected intraoperatively by observation under white light. Indocyanine green (ICG)-enhanced fluorescence is a technology that may be useful for detecting microvascular alterations and potentially preventing anastomotic leakage. The aim of this Editorial-Minireview is to briefly and critically assess the literature evidence regarding the feasibility of using an ICG ?uorescent tracer for detecting microvascular changes in the perianastomotic tissue and its potential role in preventing anastomotic leakage. We focused on minimally invasive (robotic and laparoscopic) colorectal surgery. Intraoperative ICG angiography and the quantification of ICG kinetics can be used to intraoperatively reveal the tissue-perfusion status during colorectal surgery. This may be useful for intraoperatively changing a previously planned resection\/anastomotic level, and conceivably decreasing the degree of anastomotic leakage. At this stage, even though ICG technology appears to be very promising and some preliminary clinical studies have suggested that certain ICG pharmacokinetic parameters may be used to predict leakage, more reliable scoring and grading tools are needed. Furthermore, in minimally invasive colorectal surgery, more randomized prospective well-powered trials are needed to properly standardize this surgical technology.","504":"Carboxytherapy is the therapeutic use of carbon dioxide (CO2) in its gaseous state. Since 1933, carboxytherapy has referred to either the subcutaneous injection of CO2 or percutaneous application in a warm bath. The present clinical study was performed to determine if there were any changes in the dermis after the application of a transcutaneous gel, which is claimed to produce CO2, and, if so, how these changes compared to those with CO2 injection. Ten patients received transcutaneous treatment with the gel on one side of the face and the other side without any product was used as a control. We used videocapillaroscopy with an optic probe (VCSO) to evaluate the changes in the microcirculation of the skin. VCSO was performed for the treated right and untreated left ear lobes in each patient. VCSO was performed before treatment was started (VCSO1) and after 7 days of treatment (VCSO2). A comparison of VCSO1 to VCSO2 showed an increase in the microcirculation, an increase in vertical and horizontal capillaries, and a reduction in the area of ischemia. These results are similar to those observed in other studies with CO2 injection. In conclusion, use of this transcutaneous CO2 gel produced changes in the dermis similar to those observed with subcutaneous injection of CO2.","505":"Diabetic footfoot ulcer (DFU) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus, and possibly the major morbidity of the diabetic foot. It is the most common foot injury in diabetic patients and can lead to lower-extremity amputation. Management of DFU requires a systematic knowledge of the major risk factors for amputation, frequent routine evaluation, scrupulous preventive maintenance, and correction of peripheral arterial insufficiency. Carboxytherapy refers to the subcutaneous injection of CO2 to improve the microcirculation and promote wound-healing by stimulating the microcirculation. Since optimal ulcer-healing requires adequate tissue perfusion, it is considered that carboxytherapy could be useful in the treatment of DFU. The present prospective clinical study included 40 patients with different sizes and types of chronic DFU. In addition to cleaning of the wound, antibiotics and debridement as necessary, the treatment protocol included blood sugar control, medication, healthy habits, no weight-bearing, and carboxytherapy. The results showed that this treatment that included carboxytherapy promoted wound-healing and prevented amputation. These positive effects should be confirmed through a complete study that includes different clinical and instrumental parameters.","506":"Virtual rehabilitation therapies have been developed to focus on improving care for those suffering from various musculoskeletal disorders. There has been evidence suggesting that real-time virtual rehabilitation may be equivalent to conventional methods for adherence, improvement of function, and relief of pain seen in these conditions. This study specifically evaluated the use of a virtual physical therapy\/rehabilitation platform for use during the postoperative period after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The use of this technology has the potential benefits that allow for patient adherence, cost reductions, and coordination of care.","507":null,"508":"Maintaining skin integrity is espoused by several international authorities as a benchmark for patient safety and quality of care. National guidelines advocate the use of prophylactic multi-layer foam dressings over bony prominences for the prevention of pressure ulcers or injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of best practice guidelines including the use of multi-layer foam dressings for the prevention of pressure injuries. The analysis involved data from a total number of 62 unique patients. The incidence rate prior to the implementation of best practices was 5.2%. The incidence after the implementation was 0%.","509":"The video-assisted subcutaneous destruction of the sinus tract (VADST) is a novel, minimally-invasive technique for the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease (PSD). This is an advancement of the previously described subcutaneous destruction of the sinus tract and the removal of hairs as well as the long-term vessel-loop drainage of the wound channel (DST). Although the first results of this operation seemed to be promising, some of my colleagues felt that the blind approach to this procedure could be its potential \"weak point\". As a result of this critique, the procedure was enhanced with the subcutaneous video-assisted inspection of the natal cleft. Throughout most steps of VADST, like the widening of pilonidal pits with mosquito and\/or Pean clamps, the subcutaneous destroying of the sinus tract, lifting the skin in a natal cleft with a curette, removing the hair with a Pean clamp and a subcutaneous vessel-loop drainage, were found to be similar to DST. The new steps involve the possibility of the video-assisted control of hair vestiges and bleedings as well as the removal of hair and debris under visual control. A rigid choledochoscope from Berci (Firma Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) was used for the subcutaneous endoscopic examination of the natal cleft area. Neither gas application nor water perfusion were necessary for this step. Three patients with simple forms of PSD, and one patient with an acute abscess formation, underwent the VADST procedure. The patients with simple forms of PSD had no adverse events during the first eight weeks postoperatively. The patient with an acute abscess formation developed a purulent inflammation that required a wide local excision with an open-wound healing. Due to the very small number of patients in this report, we were not able to asses this technique properly. Contrary to DST, we intend to use VADST, not only for the treatment of patients with simple forms (primary pilonidal sinus without abscessed inflammation with maximal three orifices, all of them inside the navicular area), but also for the treatment of complex PSD forms.","510":null,"511":null,"512":"Fibular head avulsion fractures are rare injuries determined by traction of the fibular attachment of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). Surgical treatment is often recommended with different techniques such as tension band fixation or lag screws stabilization. In this article, we describe a fixation technique of fibular head fractures obtained through the use of anchors. A 45-year-old athletic patient came to our attention in our traumatologic service after a motorcycle accident. He reported a complex injury of the posterolateral corner with an avulsion fracture of the left fibular head. We performed a clinical evaluation at the final follow-up visit (six months). We demonstrated that the use of suture anchors may be an effective technique of fixation in avulsion fracture of the fibular head associated with combined posterolateral corner injuries.","513":"The growing trends of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) foreshadow an inevitable increase in the financial burden on healthcare expenditure estimated to almost nine billion dollars annually. This study aims to demonstrate the potential savings when using all-polyethylene (AP) compared to metal-backed (MB) tibial components and describes the cost variability amongst three major commercially available implants. The cost of AP versus MB implants was analyzed using a large nationwide database, Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI). Cost of femoral components and patellar buttons were excluded. The three manufacturers included in the study were DePuy, Smith&amp;Nephew, and Stryker (Zimmer data was not available for analysis). Our results show that AP components were significantly less costly in comparison to other manufacturers, and the average AP price was $1,009. The average MB (baseplate plus liner) price was $2,054 (p&lt;0.01). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the means of the AP components showed no significant difference in prices among the three studied manufacturers (p=0.946). Our results demonstrate that, regardless of the manufacturing company, AP tibial components are significantly cheaper than their MB counterparts. A literature review revealed that, when indicated, AP implants are not inferior to MB in terms of survivorship or outcome. The average savings was more than $1,000 per TKA when multiplied even by a small portion of the large volume of TKAs completed annually. This can translate into millions of dollars in savings in healthcare expenditures. With the impending legislation of the bundled-payment initiative, orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of less costly implant options that can positively impact outcomes and\/or quality of care. ","514":null,"515":"Due to an increasing elderly population coupled with a growing obesity epidemic, there has been an increased prevalence in cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases. This has led to an increased burden in healthcare expenditures, now estimated to be over 17.8% of gross domestic product. As a result, physical activity has been increasingly encouraged due to its potential prophylactic effects on health. Recent reports have demonstrated a relationship between physical activity and body mass index (BMI) on cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health. However, the effect of the combination of the two have not been reported. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to assess the effect of various levels of physical activity on: 1) cardiovascular disease risk; and 2) the development of musculoskeletal disease (osteoarthritis [OA]) when accounting for various levels of BMIs. A total of 143 abstracts were identified for cardiovascular health and 55 abstracts for musculoskeletal health. Upon review, 11 reports were included for final evaluation. Despite patient BMI, physical activity was associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events. Additionally, moderate levels of physical activity were demonstrated to be protective against the development of OA; however, the levels of physical activity necessary to be beneficial were not fully elucidated. This suggests that the prophylactic effects of physical activity were maintained despite patient BMI. Future studies are needed to explore the appropriate levels of physical activity for optimal effectiveness when stratifying by patient BMI.","516":"The use of acellular dermal matrices (ADM), sometimes referred to as extracellular matrix (ECM), has become an interesting aspect of breast reconstruction. A great deal of literature is available, totaling over 7000 ADM-based reconstructions. Most often, ADMs are used in a skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) scenario, although heterologous breast augmentation with a sub-pectoral fixation may also require an ADM application. Their use has become an attractive, but expensive option. Available data shows head to head comparisons between individual ADMs to be mostly retrospective in nature with only a few prospective trials available. Points of interest include postoperative hematoma, postoperative skin irritation, infection, red breast syndrome, and revision surgery. This work will, therefore, highlight the individual properties of ADMs used in breast reconstruction and compare the available data on complication rates and costs for these devices.","517":"Forced-air warming devices have been reported to present a potential risk for surgical site infections (SSIs) and periprosthetic joint infections. Due to a lack of consensus, we reviewed the infection risk of forced-air warming devices. A systematic literature review was performed, evaluating overall infection risk and bacterial load. A total of eight studies reporting outcomes from 1,965 subjects were included. There is no current evidence in the orthopaedic literature that forced-air warming devices translate to increased SSIs. Accordingly, these devices should continue to be used for the maintenance of intraoperative normothermia. ","518":"Obesity is a worldwide disease affecting 13% of the world's adult female population. The reasons and the fetal risk are still unclear. The effect of weight loss as a result of bariatric surgery seems to induce an improvement in fertility in obese women. The main purpose of this prospective study is to demonstrate if there is an association between bariatric surgery-induced weight loss and an improvement in the fertility of women at reproductive age. From June 2013 to April 2016, all bariatric female patients from our institutes were prospectively evaluated for suitability in this study. A pool of 52 eligible patients was extracted from our database in the recruitment period. Of these, 28 underwent bariatric surgery and 24 did not. Both groups were observed for two-year follow-up. During follow-up, anthropometrics parameters, blood analysis, and comorbidities were checked and a gynaecological consultation was prescribed. Fifty participants were studied. Twenty-seven successfully underwent bariatric surgery with a percentage of excess weight loss (EWL) &gt;70% at 24 months, while 23 accepted the observation and control for 24 months as an integral part of the pre-surgical bariatric program. The contingency table analysis showed an extremely significant association (P&lt;0.0001) between exposition (bariatric surgery) and event (pregnancy), with a relative risk (RR) = 15.33 and confidence interval (CI) 95%=2.213 to 106.26.

","519":"This study evaluated differences in: 1) total episode payments, 2) probability of hospital readmission, 3) probability of inpatient rehab facility (IRF) and utilization, and 4) probability of skilled nursing care facility (SNF) utilization in patients who had disuse atrophy and underwent a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and either did, or did not, receive preoperative home-based neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) therapy. We used the Medicare limited dataset for a 5% sample of beneficiaries from 2014 and 2015 to construct episodes-of-care for TKA (DRG-470) patients with disuse atrophy who underwent a TKA during the 30 days prior to hospital admission and 90 days post-discharge. Patients were stratified into those who either did or did not receive pre- and postoperative NMES therapy. An ordinary least square (OLS) model was used to estimate the impact of NMES on total episode. Linear probability models were used to estimate the impact of NMES on SNF or IRF utilization and readmission. A $3,274 reduction in episode payments for patients who used preoperative NMES versus those who did not (p&lt;0.001) was demonstrated. The probability of readmission was 12.7% lower for those who used preoperative NMES therapy versus those who did not (p=0.609). The probability of utilizing IRF and SNF was 56.7% (p=0.061) and 46.4% (p=&lt;0.001) lower for those who used pre- and postoperative NMES versus those who did not, respectively. Significant reduction in total episode payments and SNF utilization for TKA patients with disuse atrophy who had NMES therapy was demonstrated.

With changes set forth by the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) program, both teaching and non-teaching hospitals are directly compared on efficiency and outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between teaching and non-teaching hospitals in the state of New York. Specifically, we compared: (1) duration of stay; (2) cost of admission; (3) disposition; and (4) 90-day readmission for elective primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Using the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database, 133,489 patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between January 1, 2009 and September 30, 2014 were identified. Outcomes assessed included lengths-of-stay and cost of the index admission, disposition, and 90-day readmission. To compare the above outcomes between the hospital systems, mixed effects regression models were used, which were adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, hospital, surgeon, and year of surgery. Patients who underwent surgery at teaching hospitals were found to have longer lengths of stay (b=3.4%, p&lt;0.001) and higher costs of admission (b=14.7%; p&lt;0.001). Patients were also more likely to be readmitted within 90 days of discharge (OR=1.64; p&lt;0.001). No differences were found in discharge disposition status for teaching versus non-teaching hospitals (OR=0.92; p=0.081. The results from this study indicate that at teaching hospitals, a greater number of resources are needed for primary TKA than at non-teaching hospitals. Therefore, teaching hospitals might be inappropriately reimbursed when compensation is linked to competition on economic and clinical metrics. Furthermore, based on this, optimizing reimbursement might inadvertently come at the expense of resident training and education. While some inefficiencies exist as an inherent part of resident training, limiting learning opportunities to optimize compensation can potentially have greater future consequences.

Various imaging modalities have different roles in the diagnosis, staging, management, and determination of the prognosis in knee osteonecrosis. Plain radiographic images can show gross joint destruction and secondary arthritic changes. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the gold-standard imaging modality to diagnose osteonecrosis. Multiple classification systems have been developed for knee osteonecrosis based on these imaging modalities. The goal of these systems is to stage the disease and guide management. Better understanding of the pattern of the lesions and its morphometric characteristics may allow surgeons to reach a better consensus regarding the timing of surgical treatment, choice of implant, and overall disease prognosis in these unique patients. Due to the relative paucity of evidence, this review was conducted to evaluate different radiological classification systems utilized in osteonecrosis of the knee joint.","523":"V an Neck-Odelberg disease (VND) is a benign skeletal overgrowth of the ischiopubic synchondrosis (IPS) in prepubescent patients.

Advances in molecular biology have aided in delineating complexity of biofilms, but the abundance and plethora of the microbial world provides an ongoing and daunting task. The enormity of this task is reflected in the chronic non-healing wound, as it is estimated that 60% of all chronic non-healing wounds have a biofilm component. The etiology of the wound, its anatomical location, the chronicity of the wound, and the varying polymicrobial population that exists in the varying clinical settings where treatment occurs, adds to the difficulty of this problem. A review of the present existing knowledge of biofilms in the chronic non-healing wound and their clinical relevance is discussed.

There are a number of different factors that have been shown to influence injury rates of tennis players, in particular patient-related risks. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of tennis-related injuries. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) demographics; 2) incidence and trends of injuries; and 3) incidence and trends of body parts that were injured. This study utilized the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database to collect all tennis-related sprains\/strains that occurred between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2016. Patients were stratified into four groups based on their age: 13 years and younger, 14 to 29 years, 30 to 54 years, and 55 years and older. Race was reported as white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Native Hawaiian, American Indian, Multiracial, and not stated. The various types of tennis-related injuries that occurred, and the different body parts that were affected were identified. There were a total of 150,747 tennis-related injuries that occurred during the study period. Thirty-nine percent of all injuries occurred in patients aged 55 years and older, 25% in patients between the ages of 14 and 29 years, 24% occurred between the ages of 30 and 54 years, and 12% occurred in patients aged 13 years and younger. In terms of gender, 56% were men and 44% were women. In terms of race, injuries most commonly occurred in patients who were white (48%). The most common overall injury pattern was sprains\/strains, which represented 32% of all reported injuries, followed by fractures (15%) and contusions (11%). The most commonly injured body parts were the ankle (13%), wrist (9.4%), upper-trunk (8.5%), knee (7.8%), and lower-trunk (6.7%). Over the study period, there was a significant decrease in ankle injuries (R2=0.691, p=0.021) and a significant increase in upper-trunk injuries (R2=0.695, p=0.020). The present study provided important insight regarding tennis-related injuries in terms of demographics, injury types, and injury patterns. This information is paramount for the future treatment of all tennis-related injuries and for the implementation of prevention strategies for those injuries which are most prevalent. ","527":"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a commonly-performed orthopaedic procedure in the United States. However, inadequate postoperative pain management following TKA has been associated with a number of negative consequences, including chronic postoperative pain requiring long-term opioid use. Multimodal pain control is a recently-popularized means of maximizing analgesia and postoperative outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of a multimodal pain regimen incorporating diclofenac, including: 1) length of stay (LOS); 2) pain intensity; and 3) opioid consumption in primary TKA patients. A prospective cohort study was performed. All patients scheduled for primary TKA by a single surgeon between March 1, 2017 and August 31, 2017 were screened for study involvement, yielding 46 consecutive patients (52 TKAs). This study group was treated with a postoperative regimen of intravenous (IV) diclofenac, in addition to a perioperative pain control regimen including adductor canal blockade (ACB) and periarticular multimodal drug injection (PMDI). Postoperative outcomes in this group were compared to those of a matched cohort of 78 patients (88 primary TKAs) who had previously been treated with the same perioperative pain control regimen. Patients prescribed a postoperative diclofenac regimen had lower mean LOS (2.10 vs. 2.33 days; p=0.053) and lower 24-hour postoperative pain intensity (76 vs. 104; p=0.056) as compared to the untreated group. The diclofenac-treated group had a significantly lower opioid consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively than did their untreated counterparts (39.8 vs. 53.1 morphine milligram equivalents [MME]; p=0.041). In addition, 17 patients (18 TKAs, 35%) in the diclofenac group had zero opioid requirements during the first 12 hours postoperatively, and 12 of these patients (13 TKAs, 25%) continued to not require any opioids through the first 24 hours postoperatively. In the midst of the rapidly-increasing rates of TKA in the US, multimodal pain control has emerged as an extremely effective means of maximizing postoperative patient outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the postoperative outcomes of TKA patients treated with a regimen of IV diclofenac. We demonstrate shorter LOS, decreased 24-hour pain intensity, and significantly decreased 24-hour opioid consumption in patients treated with adjunctive IV diclofenac compared to patients managed with our institution's standard perioperative regimen.

It has also been used to treat fractures of the proximal femur in patients with metastatic bone disease (MBD). Nonetheless, complications still occur in both patient populations and their effect on 90-day costs can be a great burden to the healthcare system. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the outcomes and costs of HA for PFF in patients with bone metastasis versus those without it. The Medicare standard analytical files were queried through International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ninth edition (ICD-9) codes. A case-control study comparing PFF in patients with and without MBD treated with HA was performed. Medical and surgical complications, mortality, discharge disposition, and length of stay were analyzed and compared. Outcomes were tracked for the 90-day period after surgery. Statistical analysis was performed through odds ratios, unpaired t-tests, and chi-squares. Patients treated with HA for fractures with MBD have higher rates of medical complications compared to fracture patients without MBD. Mortality was found to be significantly greater in the MBD cohort (8.8% vs. 2.3%), as were medical complications and length of stay. Both charges and reimbursements were also significantly greater in the MBD cohort. Patients who undergo hip HA for MBD are at increased risks of medical complications compared to patients who undergo HA for fractures without metastasis, and surgeons should be aware of these increased risks. ","530":"To determine the effort required to provide a service, the United States Medicare uses Relative Value Units (RVUs). Consequently, higher RVUs are assigned to the procedures or services that require more effort, which ultimately means the physician will be properly compensated for the additional effort required. In total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), revision cases usually are more technically challenging and require more effort than primary TAA. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the: 1) RVUs; 2) length-of-surgery; 3) RVU per unit of time between primary and revision total ankle arthroplasty; and 4) the individualized idealized surgeon annual cost difference analysis. We utilized the American College of Surgeons, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2008 to 2015 to identify patients who underwent either a primary Current Procedural Terminology [CPT]: 27702) or revision (CPT: 27703) TAA. There were a total of 653 patients, 586 of which underwent a primary, and 67 who underwent a revision, TAA. The mean RVUs, length of surgery (in minutes), and RVU per minute, were calculated. Dollar amount per minute, per case, per day, and per year, to find an individualized idealized surgeon annual cost difference, were also calculated. An analysis of variance was used to compare variables between primary and revision TAA. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. The mean RVU was significantly higher in revision versus primary TAA (16.93 vs. 14.41, p=0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the mean lengths of surgery between primary and revision TAA (160 vs. 157 minutes, p=0.613). Additionally, the mean RVU per minute was significantly higher in revision versus primary TAA (0.13 vs. 0.10, p=0.001). Based on the results of this study, it appears that revision TAA cases are appropriately assigned a higher RVU per minute for performing them as they require more effort and are more challenging compared to the primary TAA. Furthermore, not only did the revision cases have lower mean lengths of surgery, but they also maintained a higher RVU per minute. Therefore, orthopaedists can use this information to further help them yield the best potential practice design.

Several studies have shown sprains\/strains to be the most common tennis-related injury. However, data is limited regarding trends in tennis-related sprains\/strains. Therefore, this study evaluated: 1) trends in tennis-related sprains\/strains; 2) trends in tennis-related sprains\/strains by age; and 3) trends in the most common tennis-related sprained\/strained body parts. This study utilized the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database to collect all tennis-related sprains\/strains that occurred between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2016. The annual trends of overall tennis-related sprains\/strains were evaluated. Then, the trends in tennis-related sprains\/strains by age groups (less than 14 years, 14 to 29 years, 30 to 54 years, and 55 years and older) were compared, and the tennis-related sprains\/strains injuries of different body parts were evaluated. A total of 48,638 tennis-related sprains\/strains occurred during the study period. There was a decrease in the annual estimated weights of sprains\/strains, from 8,433 in 2010 to 5,326 in 2016 (p=0.094). When stratified by age, tennis-related sprains\/strains occurred in 3,295 (6.8%) patients younger than 14 years, 15,169 (31.2%) patients between the ages of 14 and 29 years, 16,814 (34.6%) patients between the ages of 30 and 54 years, and 13,360 (27.5%) in patients 55 years and older. Also, the trends tended to decrease for every age group, but this was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the most common tennis-related sprains\/strains involved the ankle (30.2%), knee (13.7%), lower leg (11.3%), wrist (10.3%), lower trunk (8.5%), shoulder (8.1%), foot (4.9%), and elbow (2.5%). There was a significant decrease in the annual trends of ankle sprains\/strains over the study's time-period (p=0.003). Sprains\/strains were the most common tennis-related injuries, and the trends decreased over time, regardless of age. The lower extremity was more commonly injured than the upper extremity, with the ankle being the most common location. Understanding incidence and trends of tennis-related sprains\/strains may help elucidate uncertainty pertaining to tennis injury statistics, ultimately improving the ability-of-care providers to work with players to develop preventive measures and better guide treatment.

This technology is being utilized in a variety of applications, including in the lower extremity. Principally, ICGA has been reported as a tool to determine pre-, intra-, or post-operative perfusion. The aim of this study is to determine objective values for ICGA in patients with arterographically normal lower extremities. Prospectively, 20 patients were identified with no history of peripheral vascular disease who were scheduled to undergo distal subtraction angiography of the lower extremity. Based on the angiogram, 18 patients were deemed anatomically normal-a patent posterior tibial, anterior tibial, and peroneal artery with blood flow past the ankle into the foot. These patients then underwent ICGA on the dorsal and plantar aspects of the foot. The time to blush (seconds) and ingress and egress rates (units\/second) were calculated. The mean time to blush for the dorsal aspect is 26.7s (standard deviation [SD]=22.16) and the median is 14s (range=4-81s) and for the plantar aspect is 9.33s (SD=18.64), and the median is 3.5s (range=1-68s).

Between 25% and 70% of patients may experience progressive peripheral joint involvement, which, despite advancement in pharmacologic therapy, may necessitate surgical intervention. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) yields improved pain and functional outcomes for AS patients with hip involvement. It is unclear whether the annual rates of patients undergoing THA have changed due to newer pharmacologic management. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the annual trends of AS patients who underwent THA. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) the annual trends of THAs due to AS in the United States population, and 2) the annual trends in the proportion of THAs due to AS in the United States. This study used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify all patients who underwent THA between 2002 and 2013 (n=3,135,904). Then, an additional query was performed to identify THA patients who had a diagnosis of AS, defined by the International Classification of Disease 9th revision diagnosis code 720. The incidence of THAs with a diagnosis of AS in the United States was calculated using the United States population as the denominator. Regression models were used to analyze the annual trends of AS in patients who underwent THA. Review of the database identified 5,562 patients with AS who underwent THA. The overall annual prevalence of THA in the AS population significantly decreased during the 12-year study period from 2.24 per 1,000 THAs in 2002 to 1.73 per 1,000 THAs in 2013 (R2=0.445; p=0.018). Annual THA trends in AS patients have significantly declined from 2002 to 2013. This decline may be attributed to improvements in medical management that delay the time from disease onset to requirement of a THA. Since THA is an option with advanced disease, the observed declining trends may indicate the efficacy of current medical management.

Limited literature has been published analyzing the reimbursement patterns for the reconstruction of this ligament and, thus, cost-effectiveness studies have relied mainly on data from a limited number of subjects and hospitals. The purpose of this study was to perform an epidemiological cost analysis of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions and to analyze and describe the reimbursement patterns for this procedure that can be used as reference for future cost-analysis studies. We conducted a retrospective review of a large private payers insurance company records to identify patients who underwent ACL reconstruction (ACLR) between 2007 and 2014. This was achieved through a structured query of the database with the use of current procedural terminology (CPT) codes. Inclusion criteria for this study were patients housed in the insurer database between the ages of 10 and 59. Reimbursements were calculated at the day of surgery and the 90-day global period. Statistical analysis was based on growth and cohort comparison according to demographic. The consumer price index (CPI) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics was used to calculate inflation. The adjusted mean same-day costs were $11,462 (standard deviations [SD] of $869) for female patients and $12,071 (SD of 561) for males (p=0.07), with no significant difference among same-day costs in either females (p=0.023 for ages 10 to 34 and p=0.037 for ages 35 to 59) or males (p=0.46 for ages 10 to 34 and p=0.26 for ages 35 to 59).

While the presence of small-sized Nabothian cysts is usually clinically asymptomatic and requires no treatment or intervention, the diagnosis of larger Nabothian cysts can be mistaken with malignant tumors, including mucin producing carcinomas such as Adenoma malignum. In this study, we report the case of a large Nabothian cyst that was correctly diagnosed preoperatively using ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and successfully treated through laparoscopic excision, avoiding the performance of unnecessary hysterectomy. A 44-year old Lebanese patient presented with chronic dyspareunia and pelvic pain. An ultrasound was performed and revealed an 8cm multiloculated anechoic pelvic cystic lesion with no solid components. An MRI was performed and showed an 8cm mass lateral to the right vaginal wall, suggestive of a Nabothian cyst. The patient was scheduled for laparoscopic removal of the Nabothian cyst. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged under stable condition a few hours after the operation. Careful preoperative examination, including the use of imaging methods such as ultrasonogoraphy and MRI, is crucial for diagnosis and differentiation of atypical presentation of benign, but large and complex, Nabothian cysts from other differential conditions of malignancies, consequently avoiding unnecessary hysterectomy. Use of laparoscopy as a minimally-invasive technique to excise such cysts is considered a valid option, allowing for a fast recovery for the patients.","545":"Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a progressive debilitating disease affecting more than 27 million Americans. Treatment is often aimed at reducing pain and slowing disease progression. However, patients with significant barriers to healthcare may elect to visit the emergency department (ED) due to OA-related knee pain. The purpose of this study is to provide a detailed analysis of 1) patient demographics; 2) payor type; 3) charges; and 4) discharge status of patients presenting to the emergency department with a primary diagnosis of knee OA. The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample from 2009 to 2013 was queried for all patients who presented to the ED with a primary diagnosis of knee OA (ICD-9 CM=715.96) and did not have a concomitant major injury. This yielded 215,253 patients. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with a post-hoc Turkey-Kramer test was conducted to assess mean differences of continuous data over time. All categorical data was analyzed using chi-square analysis. The incidence of ED visits dropped significantly between the years 2009 and 2010 (68,661 to 36,846) and plateaued between the years 2010 and 2013. Patients had a mean age of 59.9 years and were primarily women (67.3%). The majority of patients were at the lowest 50% income bracket (68.8%). The Southern US census region had the highest number of ED visits (n=91,995; 42.7%), and Medicare was the primary payor in most cases (n=87,323; 40.7%). The mean charge for ED visits from 2009 to 2013 was $1,368.39, and there was a statistically significant increase in ED-related charges between 2009 and 2013 (p&lt;0.001). The majority of discharges from the ED were routine (n=202,247; 93.8%). While the early management of knee osteoarthritis is largely successful at delaying the need for surgery, there are still many patients who do not receive adequate care and present to the emergency room for non-emergent evaluation. This, along with rising charges for ED visits, is likely increasing resource consumption and the financial impact on the healthcare system. Future efforts should focus on improving access to care for patients with knee OA before it develops into an overwhelming burden. ","546":"Vascular assessment of the lower extremity is a critical step in any patient presenting with lower extremity chronic wounds to predict the likelihood of healing and risk of amputation. This concept is vital in patients with diabetes due to their complex vascular anatomy and disease distribution. Three arteries supply the six angiosomes of the lower extremity (i.e., three-dimensional blocks of tissue fed by a \"source\" artery in the foot and ankle). In diabetic patients, assessment of adequate blood flow to the lower extremities is complicated by the presence of arterial calcification, associated neuropathy, and inflammation. This review focuses on noninvasive vascular assessment methods to better understand perfusion and direct therapy to improve diabetic wound healing. Clinical examination of pulses and Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) can be supplemented by handheld Doppler assessment of direction of blood flow and pulse volume recordings to understand the site and extent of peripheral arterial disease. Duplex ultrasound has been used, but is operator dependent. CT angiogram has limitations in the presence of calcifications and renal insufficiency, prevalent in the diabetic population. Novel modalities, like hyperspectral imaging, ICG fluorescence angiography, and nuclear imaging are being studied for their potential to overcome some of these challenges, but the data is limited. At present, these newer modalities are not widely available, but once validated by robust data, they may supplant older, less reliable techniques and improve our ability to predict wound healing. This will help reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes as wound care specialists will be able to more accurately direct patients to the best treatment plan to preserve mobility and reduce mortality.","547":null,"548":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious complication that can occur after total hip and knee arthroplasty, and can potentially lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. While various modalities have been used to prevent VTE development, the medications can be associated with a number of adverse events. Therefore, mechanical prophylaxis with pumps and compressive devices has been used more frequently alone, or in combination, with medications. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to review the current literature on mechanical prophylaxis for VTEs after lower extremity total joint arthroplasty. Specifically, we reviewed mechanical prophylaxis after: 1) total hip arthroplasty and 2) total knee arthroplasty.","549":null,"550":"Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common asymptomatic congenital heart condition that predisposes patients to paradoxical emboli in the cerebral vasculature. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of ASD and risk of stroke for patients with ASD undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We used the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System to identify 258,911 elective primary THA\/TKA between 2005 and 2014, including 140 patients with ASD. Logistic regression models calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and controlled for demographic and medical risk factors for stroke. The prevalence of ASD was 54 per 100,000 patients undergoing THA\/TKA. The rate of stroke within 30 days of surgery was 5.7% (95% CI: 2.5%, 11.0%) for patients with ASD, and 0.1% (95% CI: 0.1%, 0.1%) for all other patients. In regression models, the risk of stroke was 70 times greater (OR: 70.0, 95% CI: 32.9, 148.9) for patients with ASD compared to patients without this condition (p&lt;0.001). Patients with ASD undergoing THA and TKA are predisposed to stroke in the postoperative period. Orthopaedic surgeons indicating patients for surgery and internists performing preoperative medical clearance should be aware of these risks and discuss them prior to surgery. The efficacy of pharmacological and surgical measures to reduce postoperative stroke within this patient population should be topics of future investigation.

The outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients who develop AKI have remained controversial. The purpose of this review was to summarize and identify the current literature focused on 1) major risk factors, 2) short-term outcomes, and 3) costs associated with the development of perioperative AKI after TKA. A literature search was performed using PubMed and Ovid to find literature relevant to AKI in TKA. All abstracts found via literature search were screened for relevancy to the study topics: (1) risk factors, (2) short-term outcomes, and (3) cost. A total of 447 abstracts were initially identified. Irrelevant abstracts and those not in English were excluded from the study (n=336). Forty-five papers focused on risk factors associated with AKI, six papers focused on short-term outcomes, and seven discussed cost savings. Increased body mass index, metabolic syndrome, perioperative antibiotics, antihypertensive medications, and antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers are amongst the many modifiable patient and drug-induced risk factors associated with AKI after TKA. Perioperative renal injury is associated with increased inpatient and long-term mortality with increased length of stay and extended care facility discharge. Increased length of stay and comorbidities have shown higher cost utilization and readmission rates. Inpatient and long-term complications and mortality are associated with postoperative AKI and a multidisciplinary perioperative approach is necessary to appropriately identify and, ultimately, prevent patients at higher risk for acute renal failure.

Multiple feedback mechanisms, mainly visual and tactile, are greatly reduced in MIS. Microscopes, endoscopes, and image-guided navigation traditionally provide enough visual information for successful minimally invasive procedures, although the limited feedback makes these procedures more difficult to learn. Research has been performed to develop alternative solutions that regain additional feedback. Augmented reality (AR), a more recent guidance innovation that overlays digital visual data physically, has begun to be implemented in various applications to improve the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive procedures. This review focuses on the recent implementation of augmented display and direct visual overlay and discusses how these innovations address common feedback concerns associated with minimally invasive surgeries.","556":"Total laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) hysterectomy is a technically challenging minimally-invasive gynecologic procedure. Multiple technological innovations assist surgeons to overcome the challenges that are usually encountered during this advanced approach. Simplifying the steps of this advanced surgery is an invaluable addition in overcoming associated challenges with this procedure. We present our novel technique for a total laparoscopic hysterectomy that will optimize a single-site approach (LESS) for surgeons.","557":null,"558":"Managing postoperative pain can be challenging for arthroplasty surgeons. While pain control modalities, such as adductor canal blockade (ACB), have been proven effective, the multifactorial nature of pain perception may serve as an obstacle for optimizing pain control. This study assesses the effect of patient pre-operative physical status on patient perception of pain. Specifically, we compared 1) lengths of hospital stay (LOS), 2) pain levels, and 3) opioid consumption in patients receiving total knee arthroplasty (TKA) who presented with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score (ASA) of 2 and 3. A single hospital, single surgeon database was reviewed for patients who had TKA between January 2015 and April 2016. Only patients with an ASA class of 2 or 3 who received ACB were analyzed. This yielded 106 patients with a mean age of 63 years, comprised of 36 men and 70 women. Patients were stratified into those with an ASA class of 2 (n= 58) and those with an ASA class of 3 (n= 48). Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain demographic and endpoint data. Pain was quantified using Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Continuous variables were compared using the student' s t-test and analysis of variance, while categorical variables were compared using chi-square analysis. There was no significant difference found between the two groups in LOS (2.25 days vs. 2.19 days; p=0.805), VAS scores (4.95 vs. 5.75; p=0.306), and opioid consumption on day 0 (17.77 morphine eq vs. 23.49 morphine eq; p=0.233) and day 3 (9.11 morphine eq vs. 19.87 morphine eq; p=0.100). However, patients with an ASA score of 2 had a significantly lower opioid consumption on day 1 (32.20 morphine eq vs. 52.70 morphine eq; p=0.049), day 2 (19.21 morphine eq vs. 40.71 morphine eq; p=0.018), and overall (78.30 morphine eq vs. 135.77 morphine eq; p=0.024). Despite the effectiveness of ACB in controlling pain, patient pre-operative status may affect perception of pain. This study demonstrates that patients with a higher ASA physical status classification consumed more opioid medication postoperatively, despite having similar pain scores and lengths of stay to those with a lower classification. Future studies should assess all ASA classifications and stratify for preoperative opioid consumption and tolerance as a possible confounder. ","559":"The aim of this study is to compare short-term outcomes of right versus left colectomies performed as a form of cancer treatment. This study includes 305 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma treated by laparoscopic or open colectomy. Right colectomy has been compared with left colectomy. The study endpoints were the first flatus day, the first evacuation day, the first day of postoperative solid oral diet intake, and the postoperative hospital stay length. There were 140 (45.9%) right colectomies and 165 (54.1%) left colectomies performed. The cut-off values for the considered (median) endpoints were three, five, four, and eight days, respectively. The first day of postoperative solid oral diet intake and the length of postoperative hospital stay are significantly associated with the type of resection. The colon cancer patients treated by right-sided colectomy assumed a solid oral diet and presented a longer postoperative hospital stay compared with the patients treated by left-sided colectomy.

However, repeated injections may cause saturation of dye in the tissue, exceeding the limit of fluorescence intensity that the camera can detect. As the emission of fluorescence is dependent of the excitatory light intensity, reduction of this may solve the problem. The aim of the present study was to investigate the reproducibility and reliability of repeated quantitative FA during a reduction of excitatory light.","562":"Patients suffering from quadriceps muscle weakness secondary to osteoarthritis or after surgeries, such as total knee arthroplasty, appear to benefit from the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), which can improve muscle strength and function, range of motion, exercise capacity, and quality of life. Several modalities exist that deliver this therapy. However, with the ever-increasing demand to improve clinical efficiency and costs, digitalize healthcare, optimize data collection, improve care coordination, and increase patient compliance and engagement, newer devices incorporating technologies that facilitate these demands are emerging. One of these devices, an app-controlled home-based NMES therapy system that allows patients to self-manage their condition and potentially increase adherence to the treatment, incorporates a smartphone-based application which allows a cloud-based portal that feeds real-time patient monitoring to physicians, allowing patients to be supported remotely and given feedback. This device is a step forward in improving both patient care and physician efficiency, as well as decreasing resource utilization, which potentially may reduce healthcare costs.","563":"An issue that is seldom seen in the literature relates the detailed relationship of the splenic flexure (SF) and the spleen-both carefully examined-with a prospective approach in patients undergoing computer tomography (CT) scan. SF localization has been searched and examined in 120 consecutive CT scans. Several different variables (age, gender, BMI, indication of CT scan, etc.) have been considered. In cooperation with the Radiology Division, we brought to completion a dedicated topographic outline, with the purpose of providing a detailed classification for SF localization. The SF lies, in 52% of cases, in what we called the inferior (I) position, below the spleen. Other categories of our classification were anterior (A) and posterior (P) positions, which were found respectively in 42% and 8% of analyzed cases. Considering all the variables given, we did not find any significant statistical correlation (p &gt; 0.05). This study was carried out to classify types of SF in terms of its positional relationship with the spleen. We investigated 120 CT scans and classified the SF into three types, according to its localization: inferior (I), anterior (A), and posterior (P) types. A better understanding of the anatomic variability in SF may be useful for minimizing complications and performing an accurate surgical dissection.

The incidence after total joint arthroplasty is much lower than other non-cardiac surgeries. Since postoperative atrial fibrillation can cause increased length of hospital stay, mortality, and healthcare costs, it is critical to focus on prevention and prompt management. New onset atrial fibrillation is treated with rhythm control for patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability or refractory to rate control measures. Electrical cardioversion is an effective option for unstable patients with known complications. However, there is limited data on orthopedic problems after cardioversion. A unique case is reported presenting postoperative total hip arthroplasty (THA) dislocation after electrical cardioversion for new onset atrial fibrillation in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).","566":"The main drawback of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is the severity of postoperative complications. Staple line reinforcement (SLR) is strongly advocated. Recently, over-sewing has been proposed as a cost-effective and helpful method for reinforcing the staple line. The purpose of this study was to report our initial experience with LSG comparing over-sewing over the entire staple line with the upper-third staple line. All obese patients seen at Negrar Sacro Cuore, Don Calabria Hospital were entered into our prospective database and were retrospectively evaluated. Complications (divided as major complications: leaks and bleeding; and minor complications: dysphagia, esophagitis, and reflux disease) and reoperations were recorded for all patients. Complications were graded according to the Clavien classification system. From February 2015 to March 2016, 30 patients underwent LSG. Patients were divided in two groups according to over-sewing: Group A-over-sewing over the entire staple line; and Group B upper-third over-sewing. Mean total operative time was longer in Group A-90 minutes-compared with 85 minutes in Group B. In regard to minor complications, we reported one esophagitis and two cases of dysphagia in Group B and one dysphagia in Group A. Gastroesophageal reflux was higher in Group B than in Group A (3 vs. 1, p=0.149). Three major complications were observed (10%): two bleeding and one hematoma in Group B and no major complications occurred in Group A. All major complications were conservatively treated. No leaks were reported in both groups. No mortality was observed. Over-sewing of the staple line was associated with fewer leaks but no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of over-sewing on staple line bleedings. Before standardizing surgical techniques further, trials are necessary to improve our knowledge about over-sewing in LSG. ","567":"Bundled payment plans are being developed as a means to curb healthcare spending. Routine histology following total hip arthroplasties (THA) and total knee arthroplasties (TKA) is standard practice at many institutions. Recently, the value of this practice has been questioned as histologic diagnoses in THA and TKA rarely differ from the clinical diagnoses. The goal of this study is to identify discrepant and discordant diagnoses following THA and TKA at an academic medical center and to calculate the cost-saving potential in the setting of a bundled payment plan. A retrospective chart review was conducted on 1,213 primary THA and TKA performed by two orthopaedic surgeons from 2012 to 2014. The clinical and histologic diagnoses were compared and classified as concordant, discrepant, or discordant. Cost information was obtained from the institutional billing office. One thousand one hundred and sixty-six THA and TKA were analyzed in the final cohort. Nineteen (1.6%) diagnoses were classified as discrepant while none were discordant. The cost of histologic examination per specimen was estimated to be $48.56. The total cost of all arthroplasties was $14,999,512.46, of which histologic examination made up 0.31% of the total cost. The results of this study corroborate the results of previous studies and support the proposition that routine histologic examination is not cost-effective. The cost incurred to perform histologic examination will become a cost deduction from future bundled payments. The practice of sending routine histologic specimens following TJA should be decided upon by the operating orthopaedic surgeon.","568":null,"569":null,"570":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an increasingly common procedure in the United Kingdom and incurs vast costs, with a mean length of stay (LOS) of 5.5 days. Reducing LOS plays a key role in improving cost-effectiveness, morbidity, and patient satisfaction following many orthopaedic procedures. The aim of this study was to identify attributes in patients with the shortest LOS following THA, with a view to targeting those with the potential for early discharge. 1280 THA cases over one year at one institution were reviewed in a retrospective case note study. Of these, 131 patients had LOS=2 days. Various factors (age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, primary diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), socio-economic status) were compared between this group and the rest of the cohort. Further characteristics of the short LOS group were also explored to identify trends for future study. Lower age, male gender, and low ASA grade were significantly associated with the short LOS group (all p&lt;0.001). BMI, primary diagnosis, and socioeconomic status showed no significant differences. Short LOS patients were also noted to have few comorbidities, family at home, and independent transport. Younger age, male gender, and lower ASA grade are associated with early discharge following THA, and could be used to identify patients suitable for early discharge. ","571":"Ventral incisional hernia is one of the most common procedures in laparoscopic surgery, however, it requires proper training before doing it in the operating room. We propose a low-cost mechanical simulator with a new optical system to learn the basic steps of the procedure and improve surgical laparoscopic skill. From November 3, 2014 to January 4, 2015, five residents and five surgeons with no prior laparoscopic experience, as well as two laparoscopic expert surgeons, participated in our study. They repeated the procedure three times per day for seven days. From January 10, 2015 to April 21, 2015, the five trained and five non-trained residents performed (each) five real laparoscopic ventral or median incisional hernia repairs under senior supervision. Operative time, decision making capabilities, number of errors, laparoscopic skill, and depth perception were compared between the two groups. A multiple regression (R) model was calculated and F-test showed a significant relation between operative time and numbers of procedures with the laparoscopic simulator (p&lt;0.001) for the resident and non-laparoscopic surgeons groups and a multiple R-squared = 0.9974 (highly significant) of the model. No statistical difference was found between residents and non-laparoscopic surgeons (p&lt;0.001), but both groups reached the same level as the expert surgeons after intensive training. Kruskal-Wallis was used to show an increased operative time for non-trained group. Pearson test and t-test showed a lower number of errors and failure in the trained group. These results indicate that this new model of simulator could shorten the learning curve of surgical trainees for laparoscopic incisional hernia. ","572":"The purpose of this observational study was to investigate and analyze the social media presence of both patients and surgeons in relation to pediatric scoliosis. First, patient Instagram (Instagram, Inc., San Francisco, California) posts were evaluated for 1) media format; 2) timing in relation to surgery; 3) tone; 4) perspective; 5) content; and 6) subject reference. To analyze reciprocal engagement, the presence and activity of pediatric scoliosis surgeons at five major academic centers were subsequently analyzed on Instagram, Twitter (Twitter Inc., San Francisco, California), and LinkedIn (LinkedIn Corporation, Sunnyvale, California). A search of public Instagram profiles was performed over a one-year period from February 2016 to February 2017. Posts related to pediatric scoliosis were selected for analysis using a hashtag search with 30 related terms. A total of 982 posts were retrieved, with 669 posts meeting the inclusion criteria. Each post was then evaluated for timing, tone, perspective, and content using a categorical scoring system. An additional analysis was performed using academic orthopaedic hospitals' websites, in which the names of scoliosis surgeons were found and searched for on Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Their profiles were analyzed for level and length of activity, number of followers or connections, and references to clinical practice. A total of 669 posts related to scoliosis were analyzed, the majority of which were temporally related to non-operative (74.7%) or post-operative (21.8%) settings. Patients (33.3%), friends and family (34.4%), and professional organizations (23.8%) were the most active contributors. The vast majority of posts were positive in nature (88.9 %) and highlighted the patient experience (79.2%), specifically related to bracing (33.1%), activities of daily living (31.7%), and surgical site or x-rays (25.5%). Of the social media sites analyzed, surgeons were found to have the highest presence on LinkedIn (55% have accounts with a mean of 175 connections) compared to Instagram (8%, 57 followers) and Twitter (33%, 61 followers). Surgeons were also noted to have more information regarding their practice, training, and clinical skills on LinkedIn. An analysis of Instagram posts related to scoliosis showed that the majority were shared by patients in the non-operative period and overwhelmingly had a positive tone. The content of the posts focused mainly on brace wear, activities of daily living, and post-operative appearance or x-rays. This information provides further insight into what patients deem important regarding pediatric scoliosis care. Analysis of the social media presence of scoliosis surgeons showed that they have an underwhelming presence on Instagram and Twitter, but are more active on LinkedIn, a site geared more toward professional development and networking than other social media options. ","573":"Tibial component failure has been a problem in total knee arthroplasty, it is still undetermined how tibial resection depth affects the strength to support a tibial component. This study examined the relationship between the resection depth and the bone density and the mechanical strength to support the tibial component. Eight matched pairs of fresh, frozen cadaver lower legs were imaged with computed tomography to assess the bone density. A right tibia was resected at minimum resection level and a left tibia was resected at deep resection level. After the tibial component was implanted with cement on each tibia, it was loaded on a materials testing load frame to measure the stiffness and the load to failure. The average bone density at the minimum resection level of the tibia was significantly higher than at deep level (p=0.0003). The average stiffness and load to failure of the proximal tibia were 1105 N\/mm (range 889 to 1303 N\/mm) and 5626 N (range 3360 to 9098 N). There was no statistical correlation between tibial resection depth and the axial stiffness (p=0.4107) or the load to failure (p=0.1487). Although the bone density at a minimum resection level was higher than that at a deep level, the strength to support the tibial component was not statistically higher at a minimum cutting level than at a deeper cutting level proportionally. Surgeons may not need to minimize a proximal tibial bone resection to maintain a stronger support for a tibial component. ","574":"","575":"While total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures have demonstrated clinical success, occasionally intraoperative complications can occur. Collateral or posterior cruciate ligament injury, instability, extensor mechanism disruption, and tibiofemoral or patellofemoral dislocation are among a few of the intraoperatively driven adverse events prevalently ranked by The Knee Society. Robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA) provides a surgeon the ability to three-dimensionally plan a TKA and use intraoperative visual, auditory, and tactile feedback to ensure that only the desired bone cuts are made. The potential benefits of soft tissue protection in these surgeries need to be further evaluated. The purpose of this cadaver study was to assess the a) integrity of various knee soft tissue structures (medial collateral ligament [MCL], lateral collateral ligament [LCL], posterior cruciate ligament [PCL], and the patellar ligament), as well as b) the need for tibial subluxation and patellar eversion during RATKA procedures. Six cadaver knees were prepared using RATKA by a surgeon with no prior clinical robotic experience. These were compared to seven manually performed cases as a control. The mean Kellgren-Lawrence score was 2.8 (range, 0 to 4) in RATKA and 2.6 (range, 1 to 4) in the manual cohort. The presence of soft tissue damage was assessed by having an experienced surgeon perform a visual evaluation and palpation of the PCL, MCL, LCL, and the patellar ligament after the procedures. In addition, leg pose and retraction were documented during all bone resections. The amount of tibial subluxation and patellar eversion was recorded for each case. For all RATKA-assisted cases, there was no visible evidence of disruption of any of the ligaments. All RATKA cases were left with a bone island on the tibial plateau, which protected the PCL. Tibial subluxation and patella eversion were not required for visualization in any RATKA cases. In two of the seven MTKA cases, there was slight disruption noted of the PCL, although this did not lead to any apparent change in the functional integrity of the ligament. All MTKA cases required tibial subluxation and patellar revision to achieve optimal visualization. Several aspects of soft tissue protection were noted during the study. During bone resections, the tibia in RATKA procedures did not require subluxation, which may reduce ligament stretching or decrease complication rates. Potential patient benefits for short-term recovery and decreased morbidity to reduce operative complications should be studied in a clinical setting. Since RATKA uses a stereotactic boundary to constrain the sawblade, which is generated based on the implant size, shape, and plan, and does not have the ability to track the patient's soft tissue structures, standard retraction techniques during cutting are recommended. Therefore, the retractor placement and potential for soft tissue protection needs to be further investigated. RATKA has the potential to increase soft tissue protection when compared to manual TKA. ","576":"Pain, swelling, and inflammation of the knee joint and its surrounding soft-tissue structures are common during the postoperative period after arthroscopic knee debridement and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. These challenges can make patient recovery difficult immediately after surgery. Several options exist, however, to help patients overcome these challenges. Cryotherapy has been noted to decrease pain, swelling, and inflammation. However, while a number of studies exist characterizing the use of cryotherapy after knee surgery, no definitive cryotherapy devices and modalities have been identified. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to evaluate randomized controlled trials to assess the use of cryotherapy after: 1) arthroscopic debridement; and 2) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.","577":"Off-loadinga diabetic foot ulcer is a cornerstone of quality wound care for diabetic patients to allow cellular growth in the wound bed. While total contact casts (TCC) have been described as the gold standard for off-loading the wound, the complexity of application and the time commitment for both application and drying have discouraged health professionals from using them. This retrospective case series, conducted in a podiatric practice, evaluated using a TCC system that helps address the three components in which guidelines should be addressed when caring for a diabetic foot: V - vascular management, I - infection management and prevention, and P - pressure relief. This studied TCC system can be applied in approximately seven minutes and the patient can ambulate immediately without waiting for drying. Of the 20 wounds treated with this TCC, 18\/20 (90%) healed in a mean of 22.3 days. The mean number of TCC treatments was 2.8. When compared to evidence published in the scientific literature documenting healing outcomes using various TCCs, this system has the fastest observational healing rate. In this case series, this TCC system for off-loading was found to be clinically beneficial for the patient in a physician's office practice.","578":"The 5.2% rate of trocar site incisional hernia (TSIH) reported appears low in view of the proportion of TSIH repairs being performed. Detecting TSIH by clinical examination may be difficult in the obese. The correlation between clinical examination and a novel radiological examination for the detection of TSIH in obese patients was studied. Twenty-six patients subjected to laparoscopic gastric bypass in 2010 underwent clinical and radiological examination by three independent assessors for each method, after a mean follow-up time of 33 months. The computed tomography was in the prone position upon a ring. At clinical examination, a TSIH was regarded to be present in six out of 26 patients and at CT scan in four. The Fleiss' Kappa for multiple raters was 0.40 (p = 0.184) with clinical examination and 1 (p &lt;0.05) with CT scan. With CT scan, herniation was diagnosed in three of 26 umbilical trocar sites that had been closed at the index operation, and in one of the 130 other trocar sites that had not been closed. Clinical examination is not reliable when detecting TSIH in the obese. A CT scan in the prone position was extremely reliable and seems to have the potential of becoming the standard method for detecting TSIH in obese patients. ","579":"Obesity has become a major public health concern over the past several decades and has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, hypertension, osteoarthritis (OA), and certain types of cancer. The impact of excess weight on cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health is not well-summarized in the literature, and there are some contradictory reports. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) on: 1) cardiovascular outcomes; 2) osteoarthritis risk and progression; and 3) total knee arthroplasty outcomes (TKA). Three literature searches were performed to identify clinical studies that assessed how BMI affects cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health. We included reports published within last five years. A total of 138 studies on cardiovascular health and 140 studies on musculoskeletal health were identified. After reviewing the abstracts and related citations from the references, there were 29 studies included in the present study. The effect of varying levels of BMI have demonstrated a relationship to cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, and TKA outcomes. The evidence suggests that as BMI increases, the chance of developing cardiovascular disease, OA, and negative TKA outcomes also increases. Furthermore, there appears to be a negative effect with being underweight on outcomes as well, suggesting that being at \"normal\" weight may optimize outcomes. However, there are several reports which make these findings more complicated. Several beneficial factors associated with higher BMI include increased muscle mass and strength, which can potentially be beneficial through better cardiorespiratory fitness or hormonal effects. Additionally, several studies suggest that improving fitness is more important than intentional weight loss for cardiovascular health and osteoarthritis. Therefore, future studies are warranted to assess the combination of BMI and activity to assess the optimal balance and how they affect cardiovascular and musculoskeletal outcomes.","580":"Pneumonia is the third most common postoperative complication. However, its epidemiology varies widely and is often difficult to assess. For a better understanding, we utilized two national databases to determine the incidence of postoperative pneumonia after various surgical procedures. Specifically, we used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) to determine the incidence and yearly trends of postoperative pneumonia following orthopaedic, urologic, otorhinolaryngologic, cardiothoracic, neurosurgery, and general surgeries. The NIS and NSQIP databases from 2009-2013 were utilized. The Clinical Classification Software (CCS) for International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) codes provided by the NIS database was used to identify all surgical subspecialty procedures. The incidence of postoperative pneumonia was identified as the total number of cases under each identifying CCS code that also had ICD-9 codes for postoperative pneumonia. In the NSQIP database, the surgical subspecialties were selected using the following identifying string variables provided by NSQIP: 1) \"Orthopedics\", 2) \"Otolaryngology (ENT)\", 3) \"Urology\", 4) \"Neurosurgery\", 5) \"General Surgery\", and 6) \"Cardiac Surgery\" and \"Thoracic Surgery\". Cardiac and thoracic surgery was merged to create the variable \"Cardiothoracic Surgery\". Postoperative pneumonia cases were extracted utilizing the available NSQIP nominal variables. All variables were used to isolate the incidences of postoperative pneumonia stratified by surgical specialty. A subsequent trend analysis was conducted to assess the associations between operative year and incidence of postoperative pneumonia. For all NIS surgeries, the incidence of postoperative pneumonia was 0.97% between 2009 and 2013. The incidence was highest among patients who underwent cardiothoracic surgery (3.3%) and urologic surgery (1.73%). Patients who underwent general surgery, neurosurgery, spine surgery, orthopaedic surgery, and ENT surgery had a postoperative pneumonia incidence of 1.1%, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.5%, and 0.4%, respectively. Overall trend analysis demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in postoperative pneumonia incidence (p &lt;0.001), which paralleled in each specialty as well. In NSQIP, the incidence of postoperative pneumonia for all surgeries that occurred between 2009 and 2013 was 1.3%. The incidences of postoperative pneumonia were highest among patients who underwent cardiothoracic surgery (5.3%), general surgery (1.4%), and neurosurgery (1.4%). The incidences of postoperative pneumonia in patients who underwent ENT surgery, orthopedic surgery, and urologic surgery were 0.7%, respectively. Overall trend analysis demonstrated a statistically significant increase in postoperative pneumonia incidence for patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery (p &lt;0.001). There were no notable trends for the other surgical subspecialties. The incidence of postoperative pneumonia differs between the two national databases. Furthermore, the incidences differed among the various surgical subspecialties; however, cardiothoracic surgery had the highest incidence in both databases. Furthermore, cardiothoracic surgery appeared to have an increasing trend in incidence. Standardizing and implementing accurate coding methodologies for this complication are needed for a more accurate assessment of this burdensome complication. Future studies should assess interventions, such as oral cleansing and suctioning, incentive spirometry, as well as designated institution-based pneumonia prevention programs and protocols to help prevent and mitigate the occurrence of this complication. ","581":"There is a paucity of studies investigating the incidence of transfusions in various blood dyscrasias after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was: 1) to compare the incidence of transfusion post-TKA in patients with and without blood dyscrasia; 2) to compare the post-TKA transfusion incidence of patients with the various individual blood dyscrasias; and 3) to stratify the findings based on gender and age. A retrospective review of a Medicare database for patients with preexisting blood dyscrasia was conducted. Patients who underwent TKA and had a blood transfusion were identified by current procedural terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) ninth revision codes. We compared the incidence of transfusion post-TKA in patients with and without blood dyscrasia as well as transfusion incidence for various individual blood dyscrasias. We stratified these findings based on gender and age of the patients. There was a higher incidence of postoperative transfusion in patients who had a blood dyscrasia, when compared to those who did not (5.8% vs. 2.7%). The most common type of blood dyscrasia was iron deficiency anemia (81,897). Patients who had aplastic anemia had the highest incidence of transfusion (16.9%). Females were more likely to be anemic (69.1%) compared to males (30.1%); however, the incidence of transfusion was significantly higher in males (6.9%) compared with females (5.5%). The incidence of transfusion was higher in patients with blood dyscrasia. In addition, certain types of blood dyscrasias were associated with higher rates of transfusion. Aplastic anemia had the highest transfusion rate. There was a higher rate of blood transfusions in men when compared to women, although women had a higher prevalence of blood dyscrasias. Future studies need to be conducted to further educate patients and practitioners and optimize TKA blood management care.

The assessment of patient satisfaction, as measured by the Press Ganey (PG) satisfaction surveys, has gained increasing attention. Our purpose was to determine the factors and patient characteristics that influence patient satisfaction after THA. The PG database was queried identifying 692 THA patients (November 2009 to January 2015). A multiple regression analysis was conducted. Significant influence was found in communication with nurses (p=&lt;0.001), response time of hospital staff (p=0.001), communication with physicians (p=0.002), and hospital environment (p=0.049). Management of pain and communication about medications were not significant for overall hospital rating. There were no differences between PG scores of patients who did and did not have complications. Hospital rating was significantly influenced by patients' communication with nurses, response time of hospital staff, and communication with physicians. Recognizing the importance of these elements, can greatly improve patient satisfaction after THA. ","584":null,"585":"The fixation and the overlap of the mesh represent an open issue in incisional hernia repair. An exclusively designed prosthesis has been developed to assure a suture-free repair and a broader coverage of the abdominal wall. This study describes the long-term results of incisional hernia procedures carried out positioning a tentacle-shaped implant through a specifically developed surgical technique. A proprietary symmetrically-shaped flat mesh constituted by a large central body with integrated radiating arms was used to repair incisional hernias in 68 patients. The prosthesis was placed in preperitoneal\/retromuscular sublay. The friction of the straps passing through myotendineal structures of the abdomen was intended to assure an adequate grip to firmly hold the device in place with a broad overlap of the hernia defect in a fixation-free fashion. All tentacle straps were positioned through a special needle passer crossing the abdominal wall laterally from the defect borders then cut short in the subcutaneous layer. In a long-term follow-up of 12 to 96 months (mean 58 months), 11 seromas occurred. No infections, hematomas, chronic pain, mesh dislocation, or recurrence have been reported. The tentacle strap system of the prosthesis effectively ensured reduced skin incision and an easier implant placement avoiding the need for suturing the mesh. Regularly performed computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) investigations proved that the arms of the implant ensured a proper orientation and stabilization of the mesh in association with a broad defect overlap. The specifically developed surgical procedure showed a quick postoperative recovery, a very low complication rate, and no recurrences, even in the long-term.

The aortic arch, however, continues to be one of the last bastions for treatment via open surgery, which remains the gold standard. Significant comorbidity and prior cardiac surgery prevent open surgery from being the only preferred option, allowing novel endovascular procedures to be considered. Since 1999, more advanced endovascular systems have been created by companies such as Cook Medical, Bolton Medical, Medtronic, Endospan, Gore Medical, and, recently, Kawasumi. The unique shape and angulation of the aortic arch often require the use of custom-made grafts, though arch reconstruction may also include in situ or back-table physician alterations to off-the-shelf devices. The goal of branched endografts is to exclude the aneurysm, while maintaining flow to supra-aortic trunk vessels. Technical success and device durability are limited by the physical constraints of the aortic arch, though greater experience may yield better patient outcomes. Typically, the initial stent-graft (SG) is introduced and deployed into the arch first. Bridging SG are then inserted via axillary or carotid access. Most often, the bridging SG extends from the innominate branch to the distal innominate, and from the left carotid branch to the left common carotid. The major concern is that manipulation of catheters and wires, both within the carotid arteries and aortic arch, create the potential for emboli leading to stroke and paraplegia. The development of endovascular-only techniques for aortic arch pathology will only increase with the aging population of the United States and associated accumulation of comorbidities, making open surgery too grave of a risk.","588":null,"589":"Drill bit tip plunging past the far cortex places critical anatomical structures at risk. This study measured plunging past the far cortex based on level of training. The time required for screw placement when a depth gauge was used to measure bone tunnel depth was compared to the time required for screw placement when bone tunnel depth was measured in real time. Thirty orthopedic surgery staff with 1-37 years of experience applied 10-hole plates to cadaveric limbs. Procedures were performed using two different drilling systems. Time and plunge depth were recorded. Penetration past the far cortex ranged from an average of 11.9 mm in the novice group to an average of 6.1 mm in the experienced group (P &lt;0.001). The time required to drill and place a screw decreased by an average of 14 seconds per screw when depth gauge use was eliminated. Penetration past the far cortex occurred at all levels of training, but decreased with increased levels of experience. Real time measurement of bone tunnel length decreased total drilling time. The time saved with real time measurement decreased with increased level of experience. ","590":"There continues to be debate regarding the best surgical technique for the treatment of paraesophageal hernias. While laparoscopic and robotic approaches are widely employed around the world, the benefits of mesh use to reinforce hiatal closure are still not well established. The goal of this manuscript is to describe the currently available results with biologic and bioabsorbable meshes for treatment of paraesophageal hernias, particularly with reference to the rate of recurrence. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify studies describing treatment of hiatal hernias with biologic or bioabsorbable mesh. The available studies were categorized as comparative (when authors compared results with a different patient cohort undergoing suture repair of the hiatus without mesh reinforcement) and non-comparative, and organized by levels of evidence. We identified two randomized control trials, a long-term follow-up to one of the trials, a prospective case control study, one retrospective case control study, two meta-analyses of the above-mentioned studies, as well as 11 non-comparative studies, which included two prospective, 10 retrospective, and two case series. Most studies involved the use of different biologic meshes, while bioabsorbable mesh use was only described in four of the retrospective studies mentioned. The results are variable, however, most authors found a benefit from hiatal closure reinforcement with mesh. The available literature lacks definitive evidence to support the use of biologic or bioabsorbable materials to reinforce hiatal closure in the cure of paraesophageal hernias. Further studies are needed to assess newer materials and longer-term effects of existing products. ","591":"The healing of venous ulcers is difficult, and several sources indicate a multidisciplinary plan of care as the best approach to the healing of these wounds. Seventy-five patients with suspected venous disease being treated at Northern New Jersey Medical Center were assessed by dedicated interventional radiology physicians as part of Wound Center protocol. Of those patients, 27 required diagnostic testing, such as CT venogram or venography. Of these patients, 11 were determined to be appropriate candidates and underwent surgical intervention, such as venous ablation or vein stenting. Results support continued referral for venous interventions. Of the 75 patients referred for assessment, 27 required diagnostic testing, and 11 of those patients met criteria for intervention and treatment. Of the 11 patients who underwent surgical intervention, 100% experienced success in reduction of one or more cardinal signs of inflammation, and all patients with open wounds experienced either reduction in wound size and, more commonly, complete wound closure. Adding venous evaluation referral to wound center protocol in patients with suspected venous disease improved healing outcomes, thus improving quality of life. ","592":"Recent healthcare reform has spurred important changes to provider reimbursement. With the implementation of the Value Based Purchasing program, significant weight is placed on patient experience of care. The Press Ganey (PG) survey is currently used by over 10,000 hospitals, as it serves to help optimize patient satisfaction. However, confounding factors, such as clinical depression, are not screened against by PG. Thus, arthroplasty surgeons performing lower extremity total joint arthroplasty (TJA) may have difficulty optimizing patient satisfaction while caring for patients with clinical depression. Therefore, we asked: 1) What Press Ganey elements affect the overall hospital rating in patients who suffer from clinical depression? and 2) Are survey responses different between patients who do and do not have clinical depression? We queried our institutional PG database for patients who underwent a TJA from November 2009 to January 2015. Our search yielded 1,454 patients, of which 204 suffered from depression and 1,250 did not. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the influence (b weight) of selected PG survey domains on overall hospital rating. The weighted mean for domain was also calculated. Multiple regression analyses showed that overall hospital ratings were significantly influenced by communication with nurses (b-weight = 0.881, p&lt; 0.001) in post-TJA patients with depression. The remaining domains were not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in individual PG elements for patients who did and did not have depression. Overall patient satisfaction among patients with depression was greatly influenced by communication with nurses. Understanding these challenges may encourage care coordination across disciplines for the management of patients with depression before and after surgery. As a result, this could optimize orthopedic surgery outcomes, but, more importantly, patient health and satisfaction, while reducing costs of care.

The majority of surgeons use a five-trocar technique, while AGB can be safely carried out with only three trocars. The aim of our study was to compare the outcomes of three-trocar laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) to the results obtained with the conventional technique. A retrospective analysis of our database was carried out to assess the number of LAGB performed with the conventional five-port technique and the number of LAGB performed with the three-port approach. The complication rate and the weight loss of the two groups were compared. From May 2006 to February 2012, 395 patients underwent LAGB under our care. The conventional technique was performed in 198 patients, while the three ports approach was used in 197 subjects. Complications rate was similar in the two groups and no death was recorded. There was no statistical difference in operative time and weight loss between the groups. LAGB can be safely performed with a three-port approach. This technique reduces the number of scars and the surgical trauma without differences in weight loss or complication rate. ","596":"A novel, comprehensive decision-making and treatment algorithm was established within a US government-run military veteran hospital in an attempt to standardize the process of outpatient wound care and streamline costs. All patients were systematically evaluated and treated using the comprehensive algorithm over a span of nine months. After three months of adherence to the algorithm, the algorithm was modified to include ovine-based collagen extracellular matrix (CECM) dressings as a first-line conventional treatment strategy for all appropriate wounds. The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the hospital's change in cellular and\/or tissue-based graft usage and cost, as well as wound healing outcomes following modification of the wound care standardization algorithm. Data from the first quarter (Q1; three months) of protocol implementation were compared to the subsequent two quarters (six months), during which time the first-line dressing modification of the protocol was implemented. Results showed that between quarters 1 and 3, the percentage of wounds healed increased by 95.5% (24\/64 to 80\/109), and the average time to heal each wound decreased by 22.6% (78.8 days to 61.0 days). Cellular and\/or tissue-based graft unit usage decreased by 59.7% (144 units to 58 units), and expenditures on cellular and\/or tissue-based grafts decreased by 66.0% ($212,893 to $72,412).

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has generated much interest as a non-pharmacologic, patient-controlled therapy. The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of TENS in reducing opioid intake and improving recovery after TKA. This was a prospective, parallel-group, double-blinded, randomized trial of patients receiving femoral nerve catheter block with allocation to either active or placebo TENS device groups. All participants were 18-85 years and underwent unilateral, primary TKA at two academic hospitals. Device usage was monitored during inpatient and outpatient phases. Participants were requested to return at second, fourth, and sixth postoperative weeks for follow-up. The primary endpoint was opioid usage, as indicated by medication intake in equianalgesic equivalents to morphine. Secondary measures included: visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores; functional assessments as measured from knee joint range of motion (ROM) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test; and clinical outcomes as defined by modified Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) and the 12-item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-12). Among 116 participants, overall withdrawal was 37.9% (44 patients) at similar rates in both study arms. After excluding for non-femoral nerve catheter (FNC) blocks (i.e., protocol deviations), there were 35 patients in the active group and 31 patients in the placebo group whose complete records were analyzed.

Hence, it is imperative that low ankle sprains are diagnosed and treated quickly and effectively. We reviewed the: (1) anatomy; (2) imaging; (3) physical exam findings; and (4) treatment modalities regarding these injuries. Plain radiographs are standard of care and routine MRI is not recommended for suspected sprains. However, physical exam findings often may guide management decisions. The majority of patients diagnosed with low ankle sprains are treated with a one- to two-week immobilization period with physical therapy focused on peroneal proprioception and strength. If a prolonged non-operative course fails, or there is gross instability upon physical exam (grade III sprain), surgical reconstruction may be considered and may lead to excellent outcomes. When low ankle sprains do occur, the great majority may be treated non-operatively. In the event that conservative modalities fail, surgical reconstruction may be considered with an open modified Brostrom reconstruction as the current standard of care.","600":null,"601":null,"602":"The treatment of intrauterine masses, such as endometrial polyps and leiomyomas, has undergone a technological revolution in the past few decades.

The purpose of this study was to: 1) evaluate the mean load to failure of different sutures, and 2) compare the mean load to failure of the sutures after soaking in four different antiseptic solutions. Load-to-failure tests were conducted on four sets of comparable sutures (eight sutures) from two different companies Ethicon Inc. (Somerville, New Jersey) and Covidien (Mansfield, Massachusetts). The four suture types included: 1) non-absorbable braided polyethylene, 2) absorbable braided glycolide or lactide polymer, 3) absorbable monofilament polydioxanone or polyglyconate, and 4) absorbable monofilament polyglecaprone or gylcomer. Sutures were tested for tensile strength at baseline (i.e., no solution; n=5 per suture), and were then soaked for five minutes in one of four different antiseptic solutions: 0.125% sodium hypochlorite, 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, 10% povidone-iodine, and a 1:1 ratio of 3% hydrogen peroxide and sterile water. Effects of the different solutions on individual sutures were assessed with analysis of variance, and pairwise comparison tests were performed with post-hoc Tukey tests. For the controls, the mean failure loads for the type 1 sutures were 118.5 N and 120.3 N, for the type 2 sutures, 145.8 N and 155.4 N, the type 3 sutures, 103.8 N and 162.2 N, and the type 4 sutures, 86.9 N and 87.7 N. After being soaked in sodium hypochlorite, the mean failure load decreased for one of the type 2 sutures (mean difference, -12.8 N;p=0.003), while the other type 2 suture had a decreased failure load after soaking in povidone-iodine (mean difference, -10.3 N;p=0.041) and hydrogen peroxide (mean difference, -14.6 N;p=0.001).

Upon physical examination, tenderness in the right lower quadrant with rebound tenderness was apparent, and gynecological examination revealed right adnexal tenderness with absence of abnormal cervical discharge. The transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrated an enlarged cystic right ovary with no flow detected on color and power Doppler mode. We performed a laparoscopy and the diagnosis of adnexal torsion was confirmed. Detorsion of the right adnexa and cystectomy of the ovary was achieved without surgical or anesthetic complications. The patient was supplemented with progesterone during pregnancy and gave birth to a healthy child at term. Adnexal torsion is an unusual cause of abdominal pain in gestation with an incidence of 1-5:10.000, and it is more often observed during the first and early second trimesters of gestation. The clinical signs are often unspecific, and an ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging method for this diagnosis.

This is being implemented through the use of patient administered surveys, most commonly Press Ganey. With a recent strive for fast-track total hip arthroplasty (THA), it is important to ascertain whether length-of-stay (LOS) in post-THA patients influences the Press Ganey scores and overall hospital ratings. Therefore, we looked at: 1) Which Press Ganey survey factors affect overall hospital rating in patients who have a short (=2) or longer (&gt;2) length of stay; and 2) whether hospital satisfaction is different between patients who have varied lengths of stay. A query of the Press Ganey database at our institution was performed between November 2009 and January 2015. We identified 692 patients who had a mean age of 62 years (range, 15 to 91 years). These patients were stratified into two cohorts based on LOS (=two days, n=403; &gt;two days, n=289). Multiple regression analyses were performed using weighted means of each Press Ganey question category to identify their influence ( b) on hospital ratings. We assessed differences in demographics and survey responses between the two cohorts using x2 tests for categorical data and t-tests for continuous data. There was no statistically significant difference found between our two cohorts in hospital rating after adjusting for gender and ASA score. In patients who had short lengths-of-stay (LOS= two days), the overall hospital rating was most influenced by communication with nurses ( b=0.335, p= 0.004), followed by responsiveness of hospital staff ( b=0.313, p=0.006), and communication with doctors ( b=0.208, p=0.049) after adjusting for gender and ASA score. For patients who stayed longer (LOS&gt;two days), the most important factor in hospital ratings was communication with nurses ( b=0.332, p= 0.007), followed by hospital environment ( b=0.312, p=0.002), communication with doctors ( b=0.233, p=0.013), and staff responsiveness (b=0.223 p=0.042). Short (LOS=2) and long (&gt;two days) lengths of stay did not affect overall hospital rating. However, amongst both cohorts, communication with nurses, staff responsiveness, and communication with doctors were positively correlated with hospital ratings. Hospital environment also played a significant role in overall hospital ratings for patients who had an LOS &gt;two days.

Specifically, we assessed surgeon responses regarding the top five areas of TKA needing improvement; which were stratified by: a) US surgeons, b) international surgeons, c) US surgeons' implant-brand-loyalty, and d) surgeons' years of experience and case volume. Four hundred and eighteen surgeons who were board-certified, in practice for at least two years, spent 60% of their time in clinical practice, and performed a minimum of 25 lower extremity joint arthroplasties per year were surveyed. They chose the top five areas (among 17) needing improvement for TKA. Results were stratified by surgeons' location (US and international), implant-brand-loyalty, years of experience, and case volume. Functional outcomes was the top identified area for improvement (US 63% and international 71%), followed by brand loyalty (Company I 68%, other brand 59%, and multi-brand\/no loyalty 66%), years of experience (early-career 64%, mid-career 63%, and late-career 75%) and case volume (low-volume 69%, mid-volume 60%, and high-volume 71%). Following this was costs for US surgeons (47%) and implant survivorship for international surgeons (57%). While costs were the next highest area for specific Company-loyal surgeons (57%), implant survivorship was the next highest area for the other two cohorts. Implant survivorship was the second most important area of improvement regardless of years of experience and for low- and mid-volume surgeons. Surgeons identified functional outcomes as the most important area needing improvement. Cost of implants was more important for American as compared to international surgeons.

The surgical treatment of Arnous's French School was adopted. The method envisions slow sectioning of the sphincter by means of elastic constriction, even dividing surgical sessions. Results were excellent, recording 99.5% of complete healings, while failures and complications numbered 0.3% of incomplete healings, 0.2% of relapses, 2.8% of soiling, and 1.4% of transitory gas incontinence. Correct diagnosis of the type of fistula, the choice of a perfect surgical technique, and thorough long-term follow-up of the postoperative progress of surgical wounds are the basic premises to achieve the patient's healing. ","609":"Postoperative dislocation occurs in approximately 2% of primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs). Risk factors associated with dislocation include: age of 70 years or older, body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg\/m2 or greater, alcohol abuse, and neuro-degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. As a result, dual-mobility articulations, which have been typically used for revision procedures, have become an increasingly popular option for these \"at risk\" primary THAs. Few studies have assessed their use in this complex patient population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess: 1) survivorship; 2) radiographic outcomes (cup migration, progressive radiolucencies, and changes in component position); 3) Harris Hip Scores; and 4) complications of the dual-mobility articulation in the setting of primary THA for patients at high risk for dislocation. Five participating surgeons performed 495 primary cementless THAs between January 2011 and December 2013. During this time, four of the five surgeons used dual-mobility articulations whenever the acetabular cup size was 52 mm or greater to allow for a 28 mm head, while one surgeon used it when the cup size was less than 52 mm to allow for an effective head size of 38 mm. The remaining surgeon used it for all THAs. Of the 495 patients, 453 (92%) received dual-mobility articulations, of which, 43 patients (10%) were lost to follow-up before the two year minimum. The remaining 410 patients were further assessed to determine those who were considered high risk for dislocation (age = 70 years, BMI =30 kg\/m2, had a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, or had a neuro-degenerative disorder). Two hundred forty-nine patients were included in the analysis (103 men, 146 women) who had a mean age of 66 years (range, 24 to 90 years). The mean follow-up was 3.3 years (range, 2 to 5 years). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess aseptic and all-cause acetabular cup survivorship. Radiographs were evaluated for cup migration, progressive radiolucencies, and any changes in component position. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Harris Hip Score (HHS), and any surgery-related complications were recorded. The survivorship to aseptic failure (n= 1) and all-cause (aseptic, n= 1; septic, n= 1) Kaplan-Meier acetabular component survivorships were 99.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.1% to 99.9%) and 99.2% (95% CI, 98.5% to 99.9%), respectively. One hip had impingement of an anteverted cup, resulting in trunnion notching, and required revision of the cup and stem. Another hip had a deep infection, which was treated with a two-stage revision procedure. There were no dislocations in this cohort. No progressive radiolucencies or component positional changes were seen on radiographic assessment. Patients reported a mean HHS of 92.5 (range, 47 to 100 points) at final follow-up. Surgical complications included one polyethylene liner that was incompletely seated, and one loose femoral stem, which required revision of only the femoral component. At short-term follow-up, dual-mobility articulations in primary THA offer survivorship, outcomes, and complications comparable to conventional THA designs in patients who are at increased risk for postoperative dislocation. Serious complications, such as polyethylene wear and intraprosthetic dislocations, have occasionally been reported with the use of these components. Therefore, future studies should be prospective, multi-center, and have longer-term follow-up to determine the true benefit of modular dual-mobility articulations in patients who are at high risk for dislocation. ","610":"Rectovaginal fistula (RVF) is a disastrous complication of Crohn's disease (CD) that is exceedingly difficult to treat. It is a disabling condition that negatively impacts a woman's quality of life. Current treatment algorithms range from observation to medical management to the need for surgical intervention. A wide variety of success rates have been reported for all management options. The choice of surgical repair methods depends on various fistula and patient characteristics, and its published success rates vary with initial success being around 50% rising to 80% with repeated surgery. Several surgical and sphincter sparing approaches have been described for the management of rectovaginal fistula, aimed to minimize the recurrence and to preserve the continence. A retrospective study was performed for RVF repair between 2008 and 2014 in our tertiary centre at the University Hospital of Tor Vergata, Italy. All the patients were affected by Crohn's disease and underwent surgery for an RVF under the same senior surgeon. All patients were prospectively evaluated. All 43 patients that underwent surgery for RVF were affected by Crohn's disease. The median age was 43 years (range 21-53). Four different surgical approaches were performed: drainage and seton, rectal advacenment flap (RAF), vaginal advancement flap (VAF), transperineal approach using porcine dermal matrix (PDM), and martius flap (MF). The median time to success was six months (range 2-11). None of the patients were lost during the 18 months of follow-up. The failure group rate was 19% in contrast with the healing rate group that was 81%. No demographic of disease-related factors were found to influence healing. The case series of this study supports the dogma that \"there are no absolute rules when treating Crohn's fistula\". There is no gold standard technique; however, it is mandatory to minimize the recurrence with a sphincter saving technique. Randomized trials are needed to find a standard surgical approach. ","611":"Efforts continue to minimize blood loss associated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The primary objective of this study was to determine whether computer-assisted surgery (CAS) and tranexamic acid (TXA) were additive in minimizing blood loss in cemented TKA. The secondary objective was to assess the combined effectiveness of CAS and TXA in cementless TKA. A retrospective study of 393 consecutive primary TKAs with cemented and cementless fixation was performed. Cemented and cementless fixation TKA cohorts were divided into three subgroups: (1) neither CAS nor TXA was used, (2) CAS alone was used, or (3) CAS plus TXA was used. Three blood loss metrics were calculated: (1) postoperative change in hemoglobin, (2) total drain output, and (3) calculated total blood loss. After exclusions, 267 cemented TKAs and 35 cementless or hybrid TKAs were available for analysis. In cemented TKAs, the mean postoperative hemoglobin decrease was 2.9 g\/dL in patients without CAS or TXA, 2.5 g\/dL in the CAS only group, and 2.1 g\/dL in the CAS and TXA group (p = 0.001). Median total drain output was lower in the CAS plus TXA group (230 ml) compared to the CAS alone (442.5 ml), and the neither CAS nor TXA group (620 ml) (p = 0.001). Mean calculated total blood loss was 1258.7 ml in the group with neither CAS nor TXA, 1023.8 ml in CAS alone, and 869.1 ml for both the CAS and TXA group (p = 0.001). In cementless TKA, the postoperative hemoglobin drop decreased from 3.3 g\/dL in the neither CAS nor TXA group to 2.5 g\/dL with CAS alone and 1.9 g\/dL in the CAS plus TXA (p = 0.024). Mean total drain output progressively declined with CAS alone and for those with CAS plus TXA compared to those without CAS or TXA (p = 0.004). An encouraging additive decrease in blood loss after TKA can occur with utilization of both CAS and TXA. The additive effect of both modalities appears to exist in cemented and cementless fixation techniques. Whether this blood conservation will result in improved patient outcomes remains unknown and should be the topic of further study. ","612":null,"613":"Approximately two decades ago, thoracic surgery witnessed the leap from thoracotomy to the first video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Minimally invasive lobectomy and hilar lymphadenectomy is now widely established as a safe and oncological sound technique that is the standard of care for early-stage lung cancer. The move toward less invasive surgery has no doubt driven the innovation of sophisticated instruments and technology to cope with the demanding need of working through a restricted incision. We will discuss the use of minimally invasive thoracic surgery techniques for sympathectomy, cardiac arrhythmia, and first rib resection, as well as traditional lung resections (e.g., pneumonectomy, lobectomy, and segmentectomy). We will also discuss thoracic incisions and approaches using VATS, single port VATS, and robot-assisted thoracic surgery.","614":"Septate uterus is one of the most common congenital uterine anomalies and it may effect female reproductive health causing different obstetric complications, in particular miscarriages and reduction of fertility. We conducted a retrospective case-control (1:4) comparative study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2) with the purpose to evaluate pregnancy complications (abnormal fetal presentations, preterm deliveries, and caesarean sections) and reproductive outcome after hysteroscopic metroplasty. We studied retrospectively two groups: 62 women that delivered after metroplasty (group A); and a control group of 248 women with no history of hysteroscopic metroplasty that delivered in the same period in our hospital (group B). The rate of abnormal fetal presentations was significantly higher in study group A versus control group B (22.58% [14\/62] vs. 4.03% [10\/248], p&lt;0.0001). Caesarean section rate was significantly higher in group A versus group B (66.12% [41\/62] vs. 35.08% [87\/248], p&lt;0.0001), and preterm deliveries rate was significantly higher in group A versus group B (14.51% [9\/62] vs. 6.45% [16\/248], p= 0.037). Furthermore, in group A, we observed a significant reduction of the abortion rate and an increase in the total number of live births after metroplasty. In our series of cases, we have observed a high rate of some pregnancy complications after metroplasty compared to the general population, such as preterm deliveries and fetal malpresentations with a higher rate of caesarean sections. Hysteroscopic metroplasty has been proven to improve the overall reproductive outcome by reducing miscarriage rate and increasing live birth rate. In our opinion, benefits obtained after metroplasty must be considered greater than the adverse pregnancy outcomes observed with our series. ","615":"The use of vasopressin and other vasoconstrictive agents to reduce blood loss during laparoscopic myomectomy significantly reduces blood loss and operative time. However, serious cardiovascular complications following the use of intramyometrial injection of vasopressin solution have also been reported. Most of these side effects are believed to be due to inadvertent intravascular injection of vasopressin solution. To describe a new design of an injection needle. Pisat's visual vasopressor injection needle (VVIN) can be used during laparoscopic myomectomy to minimise the incidence of an inadvertent intravascular injection of a vasoconstrictor solution. A total of 53 patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy at various hospitals in Mumbai, India were studied over a period of two years. Out of these, 23 patients were operated upon using a standard 5 mm laparoscopic injection needle, and 30 patients were operated on by using a VVIN. Out of the 23 patients in whom a regular needle was used, four patients (17.39%) demonstrated a significant (over 20% of pre-injection value), but transient, elevation in pulse and blood pressure readings at one minute post injection. This gradually returned to baseline at 10 minutes after the injection. None of the 30 patients in whom VVIN was used after confirming a negative aspiration demonstrated any significant change in post-injection pulse or blood pressure recordings. Using a VVIN during a laparoscopic myomectomy enables the surgeon to detect an inadvertent vascular puncture very early, even in a small calibre blood vessel, and with much more sensitivity than a regular needle. This increases patient safety during the intramyometrial injection of a vasoconstrictive agent during myomectomy and reduces the incidence of catastrophic complications. ","616":null,"617":null,"618":"In general, communication is an important aspect during surgeon-patient consultations. However, clear communication of the benefits and risks of the possible treatment options can be challenging. Visual presentation of information may increase patient comprehension. We developed and piloted a web-based application that provides graphical representations of the numerical benefits and risks of surgical treatment options. The app was developed by assessing functional requirements, developing a prototype, pilot-testing and adjusting the prototype, and evaluating the final app. In the app, the surgeon enters the benefits and risks of the surgical treatment options as percentages. The app shows the possible outcomes ad libitum as bar charts, icon arrays, or natural frequency trees. Subsequently, we investigated clinicians' and patients' satisfaction with the prototype by means of questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and by observing their conversations. The MAPPING app (\"Mapping All Patient Probabilities In Numerical Graphs\") was pilot-tested among five surgeons and 12 patients with various surgical disorders. Nine patients welcomed the app and were eager to understand the risks and benefits involved when presented as graphs. The surgeons judged the app as simple to use and valuable. The prototype was improved based on their suggestions. The MAPPING app was developed successfully and has the potential to facilitate surgical risk communication in a more structured and uniform manner. Future research will focus on its validation and promotion of SDM in different types of patients and disorders. ","619":"Post-operative pain management in elderly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients has traditionally included opioids, epidurals, and femoral nerve blocks. Although these modalities are effective, they are often associated with adverse side effects, which may have a greater impact on this population. Alternative modalities, such as adductor canal blocks (ACB) and multimodal periarticular analgesia (MPA) have demonstrated great efficacy with a low side effect profile. However, it is unknown if one modality is advantageous over the other in the elderly. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess 1) post-operative opioid use, 2) length of stay, 3) pain levels, and 4) discharge status in TKA patients aged 75 years or older who have received either ACB or MPA. A single-hospital, single-surgeon database was reviewed for patients aged 75 years or older who had a TKA with either ACB or MPA between January 2015 and April 2016. This yielded 90 patients with a mean age of 83 years (range, 75 to 90 years) comprised of 31 men and 59 women. Forty-three patients received ACB, whereas 47 patients received MPA. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain demographic and endpoint data. Pain was quantified using the visual analog scale (VAS). Continuous variables were compared using the student's t-test and analysis of variance, while categorical variables were compared using chi-square analysis. No significant difference was observed in opioid consumption between the two groups at post-operative day 0 (p= 0.832) 1 (p= 0.293), or 3 (p= 0.779). While patients in the ACB group had significantly less opioid consumption on post-operative day 2 (p= 0.005), there was no significant difference between groups in total opioid consumption (p= 0.735). There was no significant difference between groups in lengths of stay (2.8 days vs. 3.0 days, p= 0.627) or VAS scores (3.03 vs. 2.96, p= 0.922). The proportion of patients discharged to home did not yield a significant difference as well (55% vs. 45%; p= 0.331). Elderly patients may have their post-operative pain well controlled if they receive either ACB or MPA during total knee arthroplasty. Our study demonstrates no significant difference in total opioid consumption, lengths of stay, pain levels, and discharge status between groups. Future studies should utilize larger cohorts and include assessments of post-operative functional recovery. ","620":"Total hip arthroplasty is one of the most performed procedures in orthopaedic surgery. Implantation of a prosthesis determines changes in the distribution of loads on the host bone, and this phenomenon, known as stress shielding, is related to the biomechanical characteristics of the implant. Usually stress shielding involves the proximal portion of the femur by reducing the mechanical strength and ability to withstand the transmitted loads. The aim of our study is to demonstrate how the use of a short hip stem reduces the stress shielding phenomenon to the proximal femur. The study analyzed 20 patients undergoing hip prosthesis surgery with a short stem (Metha&lt;, B. Braun Medical, Inc., Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) at the Ist Orthopaedic Division of Pisa University (between December 2008 and January 2010). Each patient was subjected to analysis of periprosthetic bone mineral density by a bone densitometry (dual emission X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] with the metal removal software) at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months, following a protocol based on the evaluation of the changes of bone density in the seven Gruen zones. We recorded minimal changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the level of the greater trochanter (-1.44%) and at the level of the calcar (-3.7%). BMD increased significantly after four years at the level of the lateral distal regions (R2 +9.6% - R3 + 12.4%) and at the level of the distal medial regions (R5 + 8.2% - R6 + 13.1%). We compared the results obtained with the literature data at 12 and 24 months with the same stem (Metha&lt;). At 12 months follow up, we did not see a significant difference between our data and the data published in the literature. However, after 48 months of follow-up, we recorded significant differences in the curves of periprosthetic bone reabsorption at the level of the greater trochanter (Zone 1) and at the level of the calcar (Zone 7). The data obtained from our study are in agreement with other studies in the literature, which demonstrates how the use of short stems preserves the metaphyseal bone stock at the level of the proximal femur, reducing the stress shielding phenomenon. From our data, obtained at 24 months and confirmed at 36, stress shielding seems to minimally occur at the level of the calcar. At the level of the great trochanter, we saw a good load distribution that maintained the baseline BMD; these data are in opposition to the literature data that showed a high increase of BMD at the level of the calcar (+12.9%) and a decrease at the level of the great trochanter. From the analysis of the radiographic images of our cases, and of the cases published with the same stem, these differences in load transfer encountered between the great trochanter and the calcar seems to be related to the level of the femoral neck osteotomy and the consequent stem position (varus\/valgus). We conclude that the amount of periprostetic bone reabsorption around the Metha&lt; stem seems to be strictly related to the surgical technique and the final implant position. ","621":"Anastomotic leaks following colorectal anastomosis has substantial implications including increased morbidity, longer hospitalization, and reduced overall survival. The etiology of leaks includes patient factors, technical factors, and anastomotic perfusion. An intact anastomotic blood supply is especially crucial in the physiology of anastomotic healing. To date, no established intraoperative methods have been developed that reliably and reproducibly identify and prevent leak occurrence. Recently, fluorescent angiography (FA) with indocyanine green (ICG) has emerged as an innovative modality for intraoperative perfusion assessment. ICG-FA can be performed before or after intestinal resection or, alternatively, after creation of the anastomosis. Angiographic assessment with near-infrared camera filters allows determination of perfusion adequacy, guiding additional intestinal resection and anastomotic revision. Early clinical experiences with ICG-FA demonstrated safety and feasibility. Large, multi-center prospective trials, such as the Perfusion Assessment in Laparoscopic Left-Sided\/Anterior Resection Study (PILLAR II), demonstrated ease of use with remarkably low anastomotic leak rates after ICG-FA-guided intraoperative revision. Current randomized control trials featuring utilization in ICG-FA in low anterior resection are currently underway and will further clarify the role of ICG-FA in leak identification and prevention. Apart from colorectal surgery, FA has also been successfully employed in other surgical disciplines such as plastic surgery, vascular surgery, foregut surgery, urology, and gynecology.","622":"Newer tibial inserts with enhanced conformity (cruciate stabilizing anterior lip; CS) to obviate the need for a posteriorly stabilized (PS) post-cam articulation in posterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees have been recently introduced in modern total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether clinical and functional outcomes differ in TKA cohorts without a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) utilizing either CS anterior-lipped or PS post-cam articulation. Prospectively collected outcomes were compared in matched cohorts of modern TKAs implanted with either CS anterior-lipped tibial inserts or PS post-cam articulations. The PCL was resected in all knees. Modern Knee Society Scores (objective, function, and satisfaction scores), walking and stair pain, EuroQol five dimensions (EQ-5D) health-related quality of life, and UCLA activity level were assessed at minimum one-year follow-up. Forty-three anterior-lipped and 39 PS TKAs were matched on sex, age, BMI, and ASA classification at the time of surgery and months of follow-up. CS knees had significantly higher preoperative function scores than PS knees (p = 0.033), but both groups had equivalent function scores at minimum follow-up of one-year (p = 0.687). Eight-one percent of patients in each group reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their TKA (X2 = 0.072, p = 0.964). This study supports the hypothesis that an anterior-lipped insert is an adequate functional substitute for a post-cam articulation in patients undergoing TKA with PCL excision. These findings suggest that a PS post-cam articulation may not be necessary given the introduction, availability, and clinical performance of anterior-lipped and more conforming tibial bearings. Further study and longer term follow-up is warranted. ","623":"Orthopaedic trauma accounts for a great deal of disability worldwide. There are many impoverished nations affected by war wherein victims suffer blast injuries associated with mines, missiles, high-powered gunshots, and bombings. One way to address this is through international medical missions sponsored by industrialized nations. It is imperative that practitioners have a basic understanding of the type of injuries that may be encountered in these nations impacted by war and conflict. Therefore, we described a small number of various lower extremity injuries seen by one orthopaedic surgeon during his volunteer medical mission to Jordan. Frequently, these injuries did result in the loss of a limb and\/or function as the patients were treated without appropriate instrumentation or facilities in a suboptimal environment. Treatment was frequently delayed, and many of the surgeons involved lacked optimal training. It is our hope that this case series will lead to studies which may give guidance regarding how to best treat these complex injuries with optimal outcomes and minimal complications.","624":null,"625":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common malignant brain tumor that rarely metastasizes extracranially, despite its aggressive clinical course. This report details the case of a young man presenting with a single subcutaneous localization of GBM that arose six months after initial surgery and recurred after excision. Only six other cases of scalp metastasis of GBM following surgery have been described in the literature, each with peculiar features. Whenever feasible, surgery is the most effective way to obtain local control of disease. However, a correct approach must be carefully planned to minimize the risks of recurrence and wound dehiscence.","626":"In clinical practice, chronic Achilles tendon ruptures are uncommon. Usually, these lesions are discovered four to six weeks after injuries. More frequently, Achilles tendon ruptures are acute and treated with tendon sutures.1 Many surgical techniques are available to treat chronic lesions such as sutures or V-Y elongation with or without augments.2-3 Our case is about a chronic Achilles tendon rupture discovered two years after injury. Our patient came to our attention with a 6 cm tendon gap. We performed tendon repair with cadaver allograft. After four years of follow-up, our patient has a complete functional recovery and he can normally perform daily and working tasks without pain.","627":"Liposomal bupivacaine is a long-acting, local, injectable anesthetic that is used to potentially mitigate post-operative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In addition, it may reduce opioid use in the post-operative period and shorten lengths-of-stay (LOS). There have been mixed results in the literature with regards to its efficacy, which raises questions regarding the injection technique used. Therefore, we evaluated the learning curve associated with injection techniques prior to, and after, formal teaching. Specifically, we compared differences in: 1) opioid use; 2) LOS; 3) pain intensity; and 4) discharge disposition in patients who did not receive liposomal bupivacaine (no infiltration cohort), received liposomal bupivacaine with less optimal technique (subpar infiltration), and received liposomal bupivacaine with appropriate technique (optimal infiltration) during their primary TKA. A 1:1:1 ratio of 54 consecutive cases of patients who had no liposomal bupivacaine infiltration, those who had subpar infiltration, and those who had optimal infiltration were included. To evaluate opioid use, the dosages were obtained and converted to their respective morphine milliequivalents (mEq). The total mEq usage was obtained for the day of surgery through post-operative day (POD) 3. LOS was recorded in days. Pain scores were calculated using the visual analogue scale (VAS), obtained from the first post-operative physical therapy note. Discharge status was recorded as discharged to home or rehabilitation. We used an ANOVA test for continuous and X2-square test for categorical variables. When compared to patients who had no infiltration, patients who had subpar infiltration had significantly lower opioid use on day 0, while patients who had optimal infiltration had lower opioid use on post-operative day (POD) 0 and 3. When comparing techniques, opioid use was lower on day 3 for patients who had optimal, as compared to subpar technique. However, LOS and VAS were not significantly different among the three groups. The rehab discharge rate was lower for patients who had optimal as compared to subpar technique. There is a learning curve associated with liposomal bupivacaine use, and incorporating an appropriate technique can markedly affect post-operative outcomes. This should be taken into account when evaluating the potential benefits of this peri-articular injection. It appears that liposomal bupivacaine may decrease opioid use and pain scores when optimal infiltration techniques are used. ","628":"Intraoperative hemostasis during neurosurgical procedures is one of the most important aspects of intracranial surgery. Hemostasis is mandatory to keep a clean operative field and to prevent blood loss and postoperative hemorrhage. In neurosurgical practice, biosurgical hemostatic agents have proved to be extremely useful to complete the more classic use of electrocoagulation. During recent years, many biosurgical topical hemostatic agents were created. Although routinely used during neurosurgical procedures, there is still a great deal of confusion concerning optimal use of these products, because of the wide range of products, as absorbable topical agents, antifibrinolytics agents, fibrin sealants and hemostatic matrix, which perform their hemostatic action in different ways. The choice of the hemostatic agent and the strategy for local hemostasis are correlated with the neurosurgical approach, the source of bleeding, and the neurosurgeon's practice. In this study, the authors review all the different sources of bleeding during intracranial surgical approaches and analyze how to best choose the right topical hemostatic agent to stop bleeding, from the beginning of the surgical approach to the end of the extradural hemostasis after dural closure, along all the steps of the neurosurgical procedure.","629":null,"630":"Currently, the gold standard to repair large nerve defects is the autologous nerve graft. These solutions offer a mechanical support, adhesion substrates, and, with Schwann cells (SC), a source of neurotropic factors for axonal growth. The technical limits are the donor side damage, multiple surgical accesses, and the unavailability of large amounts of grafts. In recent years, several researchers focused their attention on the interaction between cells (nervous and glial) and physic-chemical cues that arise from the extracellular milieu. Nanotechnologies produce surfaces that mimic the topographical signals (physical stimuli) that arise from enterprise content management (ECM) to modulate the forces acting during axonal elongation. The use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) seems to be able to guide and to boost the nerve regeneration. Both research areas could be improved through surfaces functionalization by biological molecules (proteins\/peptides, growth factors, etc.). In the future, the aim will be to help recovery after peripheral nerve lesion by producing a tridimensional structured conduit, then repeat the ECM architecture and take advantage of MNPs internalized by cells and guide them through tension forces by external magnetic fields to stimulate and direct axon growing. The aims of this review were to evaluate the findings of studies that used physical stimuli (nanoscaffold surfaces and MNPs) used for peripheral nerve regeneration support. The future trends in the field of peripheral nerve regeneration continue to produce a wide variety of new techniques to improve the opportunity for advances to treat peripheral nerve injuries.","631":"Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in orthopaedics, similar to all medical fields, provide the highest level of clinical data and constitute the cornerstone for evidence-based therapeutic advances.

The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of early prosthetic joint infections (PJI) with and without the use of intrawound vancomycin powder during joint arthroplasty. A retrospective cohort of all patients who underwent primary or revision hip or knee arthroplasty by two surgeons over a two-year period at a single hospital system was evaluated. The control group received standard systemic prophylaxis only, whereas the treatment group received 1 g of vancomycin powder in the surgical wound in addition to systemic prophylaxis. A statistically significant decrease in the overall PJI rate was found in the treatment group (4\/816=0.49%) compared to the control group (13\/824=1.57%; p=0.0479). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a trend toward fewer PJIs in the vancomycin group, however, only the revision procedures showed a statistically significant reduction in early PJIs after the initiation of vancomycin (7\/180=3.89% to 0\/134=0%; p=0.0217). The use of intrawound vancomycin powder was associated with a significant reduction in the overall incidence of early PJIs following joint arthroplasty, however, only the revision procedures demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of early PJIs.","633":"Traditional methods of clinical research may not be adequate to improve the value of care for patients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR). These patients are prone to high complication rates and high costs. Here, we describe a clinical quality improvement (CQI) effort to enhance outcomes for patients undergoing AWR. CQI was applied for the entire care cycle for consecutive patients who underwent AWR from August 2011-September 2015. Initiatives for improving value during this period included use of long-term resorbable synthetic mesh as well as administration of preoperative bilateral transversus abdominus plane (TAP), and intraoperative abdominal wall blocks using long-acting bupivacaine as a part of a multimodal regimen. Outcomes data that measure value in the context of AWR were collected to compare outcomes for the patients who received TAP blocks only, TAP and intraoperative blocks, and those who received no block. One hundred and two patients who had AWR for abdominal wall pathology were included. Outcomes including total opioid use, duration of stay and opioid use in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), length of hospital stay (LOS), major wound complications, and costs, all improved over time. Specifically, PACU opioid use, total opioid use, and LOS were decreased in the two groups that received blocks versus a group that did not have any type of block. CQI program implementation in patients undergoing AWR resulted in measurable improvement of value-based outcomes over time. A CQI effort applied to the entire patient cycle of care should be routinely utilized. ","634":null,"635":"There are many standardized scales and questionnaires used to evaluate TKA patients; however, individually they do not always assess patients adequately. Consequently, many are used in combinations to provide a thorough evaluation. However, this leads to redundancy, confusion, and an excessive patient time-burden. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a usable combined knee questionnaire that combines questions in a non-redundant manner. Specifically, we aimed to: 1) create a combined knee questionnaire that encompasses questions from multiple systems, while eliminating redundancy; 2) correlate the new system with the existing validated questionnaires; and 3) determine the length of time it takes to administer this new questionnaire. In a previous study, it was determined that the six most commonly cited validated systems to assess the knee were the: Knee Society Score (KSS), The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), Activity Rating Scale (ARS), and Short-Form-36 (SF-36). Therefore, we ensured that the new questionnaire encompassed all elements of these systems. After development of the combined questionnaire, we co-administered it to 20 subjects alongside the above validated questionnaires. We then transposed the corresponding answers from the combined questionnaire to each selected validated system to perform an intra-class correlation analysis. In addition, we recorded the length of time it took to administer the new questionnaire and compared it to the time it took to administer the individual validated questionnaires. Intra-class correlation analysis demonstrated statistically significant positive correlations between the KSS, WOMAC, KOOS, LEFS, ARS, SF-36, and the corresponding questions in the combined questionnaire. The mean length of time it took to administer the combined questionnaire (mean, 10.1 minutes, range, 6.6 to 12.6 minutes) was significantly shorter than the time it took to administer the selected validated questionnaires (mean, 21.3 minutes, range, 17.3 to 24.1 minutes). We have proposed an all-encompassing combined knee questionnaire that eliminates redundancy and inefficiency during the evaluation of TKA patients. It is a reliable, time-efficient system that can be utilized to fill out the most commonly used questionnaires for assessing TKA. Standardization and uniform use of this questionnaire may simplify future patient assessment following TKA. ","636":null,"637":"Postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be an impediment to patient recovery. Many commonly used pain control modalities are effective, but are also associated with adverse effects. Other modalities, such as adductor canal blocks (ACB) and multimodal periarticular analgesia (MPA), have gained popularity due to their efficacy and high safety profile. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies indicating if a therapeutic advantage exists between the two pain control modalities. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the: 1) length of stay; 2) level of pain; 3) discharge status; and 4) opioid consumption, in TKA patients who received either ACB or MPA. A single hospital, single surgeon database was reviewed for patients who had a TKA between January 2015 and April 2016, and received either ACB or MPA. This search yielded 98 patients who had a mean age of 63 years (range, 38 to 90 years), comprised of 29 men and 69 women. Patients were divided into those who received ACB alone (n= 54) and those who received MPA alone (n= 44). With the use of electronic medical records, demographic and endpoint data were obtained. Pain was quantified using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Continuous variables were compared using the student's t-test, while categorical variables were compared utilizing a chi-square test. The mean length of hospital stay (LOS) was significantly shorter for patients who had ACB when compared to patients who had MPA (2.12 days vs. 2.88 days; p = 0.005). There was no significant difference in VAS scores (p= 0.448), proportion of patients discharged home (p= 0.432), or total opioid consumption (p= 0.247) between the two groups. Total knee arthroplasty patients who received an adductor canal block had shorter lengths of stay when compared to those who received multimodal peri-articular analgesia. Shortened hospital stays may be cost-effective for institutions and providers, however, larger studies are needed to further assess the effect on quality of care provided. ","638":null,"639":null,"640":null,"641":"Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent that can be used to reduce blood loss in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. Due to its thrombogenic properties, intravenous (IV) TXA is contraindicated in patients who have an increased risk of arterial or venous thrombosis. For such patients, intraarticular (IA) TXA may be a safe alternative. In this study, we compare: 1) complication rates; 2) intraoperative blood loss; and 3) need for transfusion in TKA patients who received IA TXA versus patients who used IV TXA. A retrospective chart review of a single surgeon was performed for patients who received a TKA and had either IV TXA or IA TXA (due to increased risk of thrombosis). This yielded 60 patients who had a mean age of 65 years (range, 36 to 84 years). Twenty-six patients received IA TXA as a consequence of being ineligible for IV TXA, because of increased risk for arterial or venous thromboembolism. Thirty-four patients received IV TXA. Complication rates and need for transfusion were evaluated as categorical variables. Amount of blood loss was evaluated as a continuous variable. All categorical variables and continuous variables were analyzed using chi-square test and student's t-test respectively. Overall, four patients (7 %) developed complications after the procedure, three of which were in the IA cohort and one in the IV cohort (p= 0.444). In the IA cohort, two patients developed arthrofibrosis and subsequently underwent manipulation under anesthesia. Additionally, one patient in this group developed a hematoma one week after TKA. This patient was managed conservatively until the condition resolved, and no further issues have been reported. One patient in the IV cohort developed a deep vein thrombosis, which was appropriately treated with no further issues. There was no significant difference in mean blood loss or number of transfusions between patients who received IA TXA or IV TXA (289 mL vs. 268 mL, p= 0.503; 3 vs. 4, p= 0.651, respectively). High-risk patients who have contraindications against intravenous TXA may be good candidates for intraarticular TXA. Our study demonstrated no significant differences in complication rates, blood loss, and transfusion rates in patients who received intravenous TXA as compared to those who received intraarticular TXA during total knee arthroplasty. We conclude that the intraarticular administration of TXA may be a safe and effective alternative for patients who have contraindications against intravenous TXA. ","642":"An 82-year-old woman had visited her local clinic with a history of abdominal discomfort and dyspepsia related to meals over a period of several months. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a superficial spreading tumor that, on biopsy, was proven to be an adenocarcinoma, and colonoscopy revealed an ascending mass that was found to be an adenocarcinoma on biopsy, so the patient was referred to our hospital. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a mass in the ascending colon with regional lymph node swelling and a gallbladder stone measuring 1.5 cm in diameter. The patient underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy with cholecystectomy and right colectomy with regional lymph node dissection, resulting in a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the gastric submucosal layer and moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma invading the colonic serosa with lymph node metastasis. Macroscopic examination of the gallbladder revealed a well-circumscribed, solid tumor measuring 0.3 x 0.3 cm with a firm consistency in the neck portion associated with lithiasis. Microscopic examination of the gallbladder tumor revealed infiltration of spindle-shaped neoplastic cells that were arranged in a fasciculated and woven pattern in abundant intersecting bundles. Immunohistochemical analyses were positive for S-100 protein and neurofilament. Although neurofibromas commonly occur in the superficial skin or subcutaneous region, isolated neurofibroma of the gallbladder is quite rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the 11th case of a neurofibroma of the gallbladder to be reported in English literature. In the present case, as in most previously reported cases, the tumor was found incidentally in the resected gallbladder following cholecystectomy for cholecystolithiasis.","643":"Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) applies vacuum pressure to a wound bed sealed by an adhesive dressing to improve wound healing. A cleansing solution, often antibiotics or saline, may be instilled into the wound bed concurrently and removed via suction, thus enhancing the therapeutic effect. The therapeutic effect results from improved blood flow and removal of inflammatory factors. Since 1995, the FDA has approved NPWT for medical use. Since then, this technology has been applied to different types of wounds, including diabetic and decubitus ulcers and postsurgical incisional wounds. There are many applications for NPWT that remain to be explored. In this article, we postulate on novel and future uses for NPWT, including application in targeted drug delivery, stem cell therapy, and the prospect of combination with filtration devices, adaptable smart dressings, and remote monitoring.","644":"Dislocation of primary THA (total hip arthroplasty) is one of the most undesirable complications with an incidence ranging from 2% to 5%. Several risk factors are described, related to the patient, surgery, or prosthetic design. The aim of the study was to assess risk factors and their potential influence on dislocation. 387 primary THA were performed between September 2005 to December 2008 at our institute (Varese, Italy) through a modified posterior-lateral approach. Clinical evaluation was based on range of motion (ROM) and Harris Hip Score; femoral offset, acetabular inclination, and anteversion were measured on plain radiograms. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Excellent ROM and Harris Hip Scores were achieved in more than 95% of patients (p&lt;0.05). The offset was restored in all patients. Most of the cases had their cup positioned in the \"safe zone\" (both inclination and anteversion). Six dislocations (1.87%) occurred: significant correlation was found between dislocation and preoperative diagnosis of femoral neck fracture. THA dislocation rate appears not to be related to patient biometric parameters and prosthesis design. Femoral neck fracture is reported as the major risk factor for this complication, probably caused by higher preoperative activity and lesser compliance of the patient. ","645":"The aim of this investigation was to determine, through two Investigational Review Board (IRB)-approved studies, if a new topical vasodilating cream (NTVC; Life Science Enhancement Corporation, Pittsburgh PA) could improve female sexual response. Study I subjectively evaluated sexual female response as accessed by a modification of the Female Intervention Efficacy Index (FIEI). FIEI was developed at the University of California as an immediate outcome measure of medical intervention to treat female sexual dysfunction.1 In Study II, 10 randomly selected positive responders from Study I were subsequently analyzed objectively with clitoral plethysmography in order to determine the effect of the NTVC and placebo on blood flow.2 RESULTS: In the subjective Study I (81 patients ranging in age from 18 to 63), a positive response trend for the NTVC was demonstrated compared to the placebo. In the objective Study II, 10 randomly selected patients who responded positive in Study I were objectively evaluated for response of increased blood flow in the clitoris after application of both the NTVC and placebo. The clitoral blood flow was shown to have increased with statistical significance for the NTVC in all 10 patients compared to the placebo, with the NTVC exhibiting an average 69% increase in clitoral blood flow. The female sexual response is complex. In the subjective Study I, the NTVC demonstrated positive trends for enhanced lubrication, genital sensation, intercourse, and overall sexual experience. In the objective Study II, 10 of the positive subjective responders from Study I were randomly selected to evaluate their response to the NTVC compared to the placebo. This was done via Doppler plethysmography (DP). All 10 patients demonstrated a statistically significant response rate for increase in clitoral blood flow using the NTVC compared to the placebo, with an average blood flow increase of 69%. This portion of the investigation demonstrates a significant positive end organ response to the NTVC. The positive subjective trends combined with the significant and substantial increase in clitoral blood flow may result in enhanced female sexual satisfaction. ","646":"Liposomal bupivacaine, a prolonged-release formulation of bupivacaine hydrochloride, is indicated for infiltration into the surgical site for postsurgical analgesia. Results from previous total knee arthroplasty (TKA) studies suggest that analgesic efficacy associated with liposomal bupivacaine may be impacted by variability in infiltration technique. The PILLAR study is designed to assess liposomal bupivacaine efficacy in TKA using a standardized infiltration protocol. Materials and Methods\/Design: This phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group study will compare the safety and efficacy of infiltration with liposomal bupivacaine versus standard bupivacaine for postsurgical pain control in adults undergoing primary unilateral TKA. All subjects will receive a standardized pre-surgical analgesic regimen, and will be randomized to receive either liposomal bupivacaine 266 mg\/20 mL (admixed with standard bupivacaine 0.5% 20 mL and expanded to a total volume of 120 mL) or bupivacaine 0.5% 20 mL (expanded to a total volume of 120 mL). The study drug will be infiltrated using six syringes (prefilled with 20 mL of study drug solution) to deliver 1-1.5 mL infusions into prespecified periarticular tissues. All subjects will receive standardized postsurgical analgesia and access to rescue medication. The co-primary efficacy endpoints are area under the curve of visual analog scale pain intensity scores from 12-48 hours postsurgery and total postsurgical opioid consumption from 0-48 hours. Secondary efficacy endpoints include other pain assessments, time to first use of rescue medication, discharge readiness, use of skilled nursing facilities, and hospital length of stay. Safety will be evaluated based on adverse events. The use of a standardized protocol comparing infiltration of equal volumes of the study drug, designed by experienced investigators to ensure complete coverage of all areas innervating the surgical site while minimizing leakage of study drug, will help define the role of liposomal bupivacaine in the setting of TKA.

We analyzed 424,107 patients from a national private payer database from 2007 to 2015 to determine who had diabetes and underwent TKA. We determined the incidence of revision TKA in the overall cohort and stratified it by glycated hemoglobin levels. Correlation analysis between the levels of glycated hemoglobin and the incidence of revision TKA was performed. We performed descriptive statistics of the underlying cause of revision TKA in both the overall and stratified cohorts. There was a 3.2% incidence of revision in the overall cohort. When stratified by glycated hemoglobin levels, the cohort in the 6.6 to 7.0% category had the lowest incidence of revision (2.9%). The cohorts in the 8.6 to 9% glycated hemoglobin category had the highest revision rate (4.7%). There was a significantly positive correlation between rate of revision and ascending glycated hemoglobin levels, and a significantly negative correlation between descending glycated hemoglobin levels and revision incidence. The most common cause of revision was infection in the overall and stratified groups. Sub-optimal glycated hemoglobin levels in diabetic patients correlated with increased revision rates in those who underwent TKA. Management of diabetics should be optimized before undergoing TKA to minimize revision surgery risk.

Further study of robotic hernia repair is needed prospectively as its use increases to delineate the true benefits.","652":null,"653":null,"654":"We report on unexpected findings in 18 spinal cord injured peoples who underwent a laparoscopic bilateral implantation of neuroprosthesis (LION procedure) to the sciatic\/femoral nerves pelvic somatic nerves for functional electrical stimulation (FES)-assisted locomotor training and continuous low-frequency electrical stimulation. Fifteen patients were paraplegics, three low tetraplegics, all of them fully dependent on a wheelchair. After a training period of at least one year, all patients not only started with electrical-assisted standing\/stepping using a walker or crutches, but also developed some progressive caudalward recovery of lumbosacral sensoric functions and of supraspinal control of voluntary movements below the lesions. Twelve patients are currently capable of weight-bearing standing and stepping with crutches by simultaneous electrical stimulation (the best of the series for 2.6km), and six of them are capable of walking several meters (the best of the series for 400m) without electrical stimulation. Our findings suggest that FES-assisted locomotor training in combination with continuous low-frequency pelvic nerves in spinal cord injury patients may induce changes that affect the central pattern generator and allows supra- and infraspinal inputs to engage residual spinal or extra spinal pathways for reconnection.","655":"Patients who undergo laparoscopic ventral hernia repair can have significant post-operative pain and discomfort from both somatic pain due to mesh fixation and visceral pain due to CO2 insufflation pressure. In an attempt to improve outcomes, a Clinical Quality Improvement (CQI) project was implemented by a multi-disciplinary hernia team. CQI tools were applied for consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair from June 2012 through September 2015 (39 months). Initiatives for improved patient outcomes during this period included the administration of a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block and\/or an intra-operative block with long-acting local anesthetic first, and then a low pressure pneumoperitoneum (LPP) system was implemented later in the project. One-hundred-twenty patients who underwent a laparoscopic ventral\/incisional hernia repair were included in the analysis. Fifty-three patients had no block and had conventional insufflation at 15 mmHg (No Block-No LPP group). Outcomes for this group included a median time in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) of 126 minutes, a median length of stay of 4.0 days, a median use of opioid morphine equivalents (MEQ) in the PACU of 10.0, and a total use of opioid MEQ for the entire hospital stay of 100.0. Thirty-seven patients had blocks with a long-acting local anesthetic and conventional insufflation at 15 mmHg (Block only group). Outcomes for this group showed improvement for all outcomes, but none were statistically significant. Thirty patients had blocks with a long-acting local anesthetic and a low pressure pneumoperitoneum system with a standard pressure of 8 mmHg. Outcomes for this group included a median time in PACU of 83.6 minutes, a median length of stay of 1.5 days, a median amount of opioid use in the PACU of 5.0 MEQ, and a median use of opioid use for the entire hospital stay of 26.0 MEQ. All of these outcomes were statistically significant improvements compared with the No Block-No LPP and Block only groups. Implementation of a CQI program, including long-acting local anesthetic blocks and a low pressure pneumoperitoneum system as part of a multi-modal pain strategy for patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, was associated with decreased PACU time, decreased length of stay, and less opioid use in the PACU and for the entire hospital stay.","656":"The number of individuals with chronic cutaneous wounds has been increasing worldwide due to an aging population, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In the United States, almost seven million Americans have chronic skin ulcers. Many therapeutic approaches have been used. However, the treatment outcomes are not always ideal because of failure to achieve complete wound closure in around 60% of cases, scarring, and high rate of recurrence. Therefore, there is a need for more effective therapies. Stem cells offer promising possibilities. Pre-clinical studies have shown that bone- or adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a competitive advantage over other types of stem cells due to their better defined multipotent differentiating potential, paracrine effects, immunomodulatory properties, and safety. However, large controlled clinical trials are needed to examine the capabilities of MSCs in humans and to assess their safety profile. In this review, we highlight emerging treatments in tissue regeneration and repair and provide some perspectives on how to translate current knowledge about stem cells-both multipotent and pluripotent-into viable clinical approaches for treating patients with difficult to heal wounds.","657":"VATS lobectomy is a safe and effective treatment strategy for operable stage I and II lung cancer. It has a similar five-year survival compared to open lobectomy (thoracotomy). VATS lobectomy is associated with less postoperative complications and shorter hospital length of stay when compared to lobectomy by thoracotomy. VATS lobectomy has not been widely adopted by the thoracic surgical community, in part, due to technical reasons. Pulmonary artery branch manipulation in VATS lobectomy is one of the most critical parts of the procedure, especially when endostaplers are used for ligation and division of the vessel. Energy devices have improved in recent years, and their application for VATS lobectomy is gaining traction. There is more and more evidence supporting the safety of ultrasonic shears to seal and divide small pulmonary artery branches. These devices are smaller and finer than endostaplers and have the potential to reduce the risk of PA injury. These more user-friendly devices may enable thoracic surgeons who are currently performing lobectomy by thoracotomy to transition to VATS. Energy devices are also useful for hilar dissection and mediastinal lymph node dissection in VATS lobectomy.","658":"Biosurgical materials (biosurgicals) have a wide array of uses for providing hemostasis, including decreasing the risk of postoperative bleeding and, intraoperatively, controling bleeding. These materials are especially useful in situations where electrocautery, sutures, or clips are not feasible. Biosurgicals have long been used in general surgery and surgical subspecialties to provide hemostasis; however, they still are not commonly used during obstetric and gynecologic procedures. Three commonly used classes of biosurgicals will be discussed in this article: oxidized regenerated cellulose, flowables, fibrin sealants, and fibrin sealant patches. Each of these agents has a different role to play during minimally invasive gynecologic surgery (MIGS), either singularly or in combination with each other. One unique fibrin product is a fibrin sealant patch, which is a combination of products used to treat bleeding of various intensities, including acute, severe hemorrhagic situations. It is important for the MIGS surgeon to understand the nature and use of each product to be able to use biosurgicals appropriately for hemostasis management. This article reviews biosurgical products, their composition, and application in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. Included will be a few of the \"on label\" and \"off-label\" uses of biosurgicals-either singularly or in combination-and tips for introducing these materials during MIGS procedures.","659":null,"660":"Traditional techniques to balance total knee arthroplasties are often subject to variability, as they are usually based on the surgeon's subjective assessment.

Global endometrial ablation (GEA) devices have supplanted resectoscopic ablation primarily because they have brought with them technical simplicity and unprecedented safety. These devices, all of which received FDA approval between 1997 and 2001, are typically used to treat abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women. Several million women in the US who have undergone a previous EA procedure are about to enter the risk pool for the development of endometrial cancer (EC). Ours is the 18th reported case of post-ablation endometrial carcinoma (PAEC) in the English literature. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges faced in evaluating women with a history of a previous EA who cannot be properly evaluated with conventional techniques such as endometrial biopsy and sonohysterography.","662":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of non-ablative, monopolar transcutaneous temperature controlled radiofrequency (TTCRF) technology in the treatment of postmenopausal women suffering from genuine stress urinary incontinence (SUI) related to menopause and to evaluate histological changes vaginally associated with the treatment. Subjective and objective symptoms of SUI were assessed in study subjects before and after TTCRF, (1 treatment every 30 days, for 3 months; n=10) and compared with the effects of a placebo treatment on a control group of demographically similar women (n =10). SUI was subjectively evaluated with subjective Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and with the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) before and after TTCRF treatments and objectively with cough stress test. Vaginal health was evaluated with the Vaginal Health Index (VHI) score and visual analogue score (VAS) for dyspareunia and dryness. Punch biopsies were obtained at the urethra-vesical junction in the anterior compartment, before and at the end of the treatment protocol. Basic and histochemical staining methods were used. In subjects suffering SUI, TTCRF treatment was associated with a significant (p&lt;0.01) improvement of ICIQ-SF and UDI-6 scores. Seven of 10 patients (70%) had a negative cough stress test after the treatment protocol. Improvements were maintained up to the 12th week of follow-up. The results were supported by the positive histologic changes seen vaginally in women suffering from postmenopausal vaginal atrophy. TTCRF was well tolerated with no complications reported in study patients. TTCRF treatment in postmenopausal women suffering from SUI showed significant improvement in both objective and subjective symptoms. Vaginal health scores also improved as did VAS for dryness and dyspareunia. We feel these improvements were related to histological changes related to improvement in vaginal atrophy that were not observed in placebo patients. ","663":"How the relative volume of an epidural abscess on MRI affects outcomes with antibiotics alone has limited literature. The purpose of this study was to identify which infected epidural collections will reabsorb with antibiotics alone. Specifically, what is the critical size and enhancement on contrast MRIs to require a drainage procedure? A retrospective review of all spinal osteomyelitis patients from 2001-2012 was performed. Inclusion criteria included appropriate initial imaging, lab results, no drainage procedures of collections, and no treatment prior to admission at an outside institution. Large size epidural abscess was defined as abscesses with a volume greater than 1400 mm3. Clearance and mortality rates were evaluated. The cohort consisted of 128 patients including 76 men and 52 women who had a mean age of 62 years (range, 21 to 90 years) and had a mean follow-up of 38 months (range, 24 to 72 months). Patients with a large epidural abscess had a greater clearance rate of the infection and decreased mortality rate when treated with surgery or drainage compared to patients treated with antibiotics alone [clearance: p=0.048; mortality: p=0.048]. Those small epidural abscesses had similar clearance and mortality rates when treated with surgery or drainage compared to antibiotics alone [clearance: p=0.75; mortality: p=0.13]. Patients with non-enhancing epidural abscesses had similar clearance rates-but increased mortality rates-when treated with antibiotics alone compared to surgery or drainage [clearance: p&gt;0.9; mortality: p=0.03]. Those with enhancing epidural collections had similar clearance and mortality rates when treated with antibiotics alone compared to surgery or drainage [clearance: p=0.08, mortality: p=0.10]. Large epidural infected collections require surgery or a percutaneous drainage procedure. Clearance rates are higher and mortality rates are lower compared to non-operative management in these instances. Neurologically intact patients with a small epidural collection can be treated with antibiotics alone with good expected outcomes. ","664":"Obtaining blood or tissue cultures prior to administration of antibiotics has been the standard of care in the treatment of osteomyelitis of the spine. A delay in diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis is the primary culprit for the inaccuracy of blood cultures and biopsies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of spinal osteomyelitis in patients where the infecting organism was identified through cultures in contrast to cases where the cultures continued to be negative. We retrospectively reviewed the database of spinal osteomyelitis cases presented at a high-volume institution from 2001-2011. This resulted in 91 patients (51 men and 40 women) who had a mean age of 59 years with a mean follow-up of four years. Delay in diagnosis was defined as greater than 2.5 months from first ER visit for non-specific back pain to diagnosis of osteomyelitis without antibiotic treatment in the interim. Nineteen patients had a delay in diagnosis (DD) and 72 were diagnosed early (ED). Outcomes evaluated include clearance of infection, clinical outcomes measured by Oswestry disability index scores (ODIs), and the efficacy of blood cultures and biopsies. The ED group had a higher odds ratio of osteomyelitis clearance compared to the delay in diagnosis group and this trended toward significance [p=0.08]. The mean improvements in ODIs were significantly greater in the ED group compared to the DD group. Positive blood cultures were more positive when drawn within one month compared to after one month [p=.001]. Percutaneous biopsy cultures were more positive when drawn within 2.5 months compared to after 2.5 months [p=.025]. Open biopsy cultures were more positive when drawn within 4.5 months compared to after that [p&lt;0.001]. We found that delayed diagnosis may negatively affect the treatment outcome as evidenced by the greater improvements in ODI scores among those diagnosed early. Although we were unable to show a difference in clearance between early and delayed diagnosis, it is quite possible that larger cohorts may have shown this given the trend toward significance. Hence, an early diagnosis has improved vertebral osteomyelitis clearance and clinical outcomes, and blood cultures and biopsies may have a low yield if delayed. ","665":null,"666":"A novel motion-preserving technique to directly repair pars defects. Moreover, the indications for repair are expanded to include those with disc disease and associated spondylolisthesis. The challenge in treating pars defects has been that there are few techniques available to stabilize them adequately. Treatment has focused on fusion across the inter-space versus grafting and instrumentation of the defect itself. We hypothesize that direct repair of the defect favors maintenance of normal motion characteristics by preserving the functional unit of the disc. This paper describes a motion-preserving technique to repair bilateral pars defects and its early clinical outcomes. A retrospective review of 20 patients with symptomatic bilateral pars defects treated with either intra-segmental or intra-intersegmental motion-preserving repair with two years of follow-up. Fifteen patients met the criteria for single level fixation. Five patients required additional fixation of flexible posterolateral fusion involving the inferior segment. Rh-BMP and autologous bone graft were placed within the defect. Plain film X-rays were used to determine stability, and thin-section CT was used to assess healing of the defect. The procedure arrested any further slippage in 100% of cases, with bony healing in 95% of cases as demonstrated by CT scan. Clinical outcomes for the entire series were: excellent n=14, good n=3, no significant help n=3. For all cases there was a 5% rate of non-union. Further study and development of the technique via biomechanical testing is ongoing; however, the initial results are encouraging. Bone formation appears to be linked to decreasing symptoms in patients with bilateral pars fractures who have failed conservative treatment. ","667":"Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) has become a popular and successful surgery to treat advanced glenohumeral arthritis, rotator cuff arthropathy, and proximal humerus fractures. Historical data is available investigating the epidemiology of total shoulder arthroplasty with regard to patient characteristics, outcomes, and complications; however, there is a lack of studies investigating the most recent and up to date national trends related to shoulder replacement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in the annual incidence, various demographics, and complications of TSA in America. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was assessed to identify all patients who were admitted for TSA in the United States between 1998 and 2010. National trends in patient demographics, incidence, and length-of-stay (LOS) were analyzed for correlations. The impacts of contributing factors to each outcome were assessed using adjusted multivariable regression analysis. These were used to calculate odds ratios of cohort demographics and their association with complications and LOS. Admissions for TSA have risen (8,041 to 39,072 admissions). The majority of the cohort consisted of Caucasian men between the ages of 64 and 79 years. The incidence rate of complications has remained consistent. Female gender, age &gt; 80 years, and higher Deyo Comorbidity scores were risk factors for higher complications. The LOS has decreased (2.96 to 2.21 days) during the study time period. Female gender, African-American race, Medicaid insurance, and higher Deyo Comorbidity scores were associated with longer stays. Our study demonstrates a rapid increase in incidence rates of TSAs within the 13-year period in the United States. An increased risk of complications was noted with older age, female gender, and increased Deyo score. Our findings may help health care providers identify ways to better manage this procedure and select patients.

PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, the Cochrane library, and Scopus were searched for relevant articles published from 1946 to February 3, 2014, with no restrictions on publication status. ProQuest was searched for relevant dissertations, editorials, and conference abstracts. Non-indexed journals were searched and companies that manufacture wound care materials containing PHMB were contacted for unpublished data. Only randomized controlled trials available in English were included. Bias was assessed using the CONSORT document for all included studies. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined, four reviewers (ET, SK, SG, RD) independently reviewed each title and abstract of the literature search results to determine whether the paper should be included for this review. When disagreements on study inclusion emerged, reviewers resolved them through discussion. Of the 1,725 articles identified in the search, 6 met inclusion criteria. Four studies reported wound healing. Two of these studies evaluated changes in wound surface area and the other two evaluated wound bed evolution with variable results. In five studies, participants randomly assigned to PHMB topical agents showed significant improvement in bacterial control compared to control groups. Five studies reported pain reduction from the use of PHMB agents. There were a small number of eligible studies found, but the interventions, outcome measures, and outcome reporting varied greatly, making meta-analysis impossible. PHMB agents were shown to promote healing and reduce pain more effectively than control treatments. The existing evidence shows that topical PHMB may promote healing of chronic stalled wounds, reduce bacterial burden, eliminate methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and alleviate wound-related pain. ","670":"Acute pain in the postoperative period after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) has a significant effect on early rehabilitation, hospital length of stay, and the development of chronic pain. Consequently, efforts have been made to predict the occurrence of postoperative pain using preoperative and intraoperative factors. In this study, we tested the usefulness of preoperative pressure pain threshold (PPT) values in the prediction of three outcomes for patients who underwent TJA: visual analog scale pain scores, hospital length of stay, and opioid consumption. Using a digital pressure algometer, we measured the preoperative PPT in 41 patients expected to undergo TJA at three different body sites: the first web space of the hand, the operative joint, and the contralateral joint. We correlated each PPT separately with postoperative visual analog scale pain scores, hospital length of stay, and opioid consumption. No significant correlation was found between preoperative PPT and the three postoperative outcomes. This finding held true when patients were subdivided by surgery type (total knee arthroplasty vs. total hip arthroplasty). There was no significant difference in PPT between the three body testing sites. This study failed to prove the usefulness of PPT in the prediction of acute postoperative pain, pain medication consumption, and length of stay. The pressure algometer has previously found a place in the assessment of pain in a variety of clinical settings, but its utility has not yet been demonstrated in patients undergoing TJA. ","671":null,"672":"Alkaptonuria is a rare hereditary metabolic disorder that leads to the accumulation of homogentisic acid accumulation and weakens the collagen, creating fissuring and articular cartilage degeneration. Therefore, we are reporting a multicenter case series of three patients (four arthroplasties) who presented with signs and symptoms of ochronotic arthropathy-and eventually underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA)-and provide a review of the current literature on total joint arthroplasty in ochronotic osteoarthritis. Each patient achieved excellent Knee Society Scores (KSS) after at least a five-year follow-up-regardless of receiving cemented or cementless prostheses-and suffered no complications. There have been a number of case reports published on patients who had TKA and were found to have a diagnosis of ochronosis. We believe that surgery for symptomatic patients who are surgical candidates for TKA should not be delayed for concerns of complications. However, future studies should compare outcomes to those who undergo TKA without ochronotic arthropathy.","673":"Traumatic pubic symphysis diastases (PSD) are life-threatening injuries that often require operative fixation. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the outcomes of patients following various operative fixation techniques of these particular pelvic ring injuries. Specifically, we will analyze the role of: (1) surgical approach; (2) implant failure; and (3) fixation methods in treating traumatic PSD. They are typically fixed using the Pfannestiel approach, but a midline approach may be used in cases where this is not ideal. These fractures often have implant failure; however, studies have shown this does not impact clinical outcomes. Currently, the gold standard of fixation is multiple-hole plate fixation. There are a number of other surgical fixation methods such as two-hole plating or percutaneous fixation that may be considered as well. Future studies should focus on the long-term outcomes and efficacy of these new innovative techniques for fixation of traumatic PSD.","674":"Adipose derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells including multipotent adipose derived stems cells, other progenitor cells, fibroblasts, T-regulatory cells, and macrophages. Preclinical data exist supporting benefits that are predominantly through angiogenesis, modulation of inflammation, and wound remodeling. Such effects are likely paracrine in nature. The application of autologous ADRCs has been investigated across multiple therapeutic areas. While there are numerous publications, there is a relative lack of double-blind, well-controlled, randomized clinical trials in the literature. Nevertheless, a consistency in outcomes and a consistency with preclinical and laboratory studies suggests a true positive effect. The therapeutic areas reported include orthopedics, autoimmune disease, wounds and reconstruction, cardiology, peripheral vascular disease, genitourinary disorders, gastrointestinal fistulas, and neurology. Case reports have documented wound healing in otherwise intractable wounds such as ischemic- and radiation-related cutaneous ulcers and enterocutaneous fistulas. An open label, 12-patient-study indicated substantial improvement in hand manifestations of scleroderma across multiple endpoints. Post-radical prostatectomy urinary incontinence improved in a study of 11 patients with local delivery of ADRCs. Small studies of intramyocardial delivery have been associated with trends towards benefit. The studies also indicate that same day fat harvest through liposuction, cell processing, and cell delivery is feasible and can be performed with an acceptable safety profile. The objective of this review is to highlight the interest, potential, and trends that support the need to continue evaluation and exploration for the role of ADRCs as a therapeutic agent.","675":"Femoral head core decompression is an efficacious joint-preserving procedure for treatment of early stage avascular necrosis. However, postoperative fractures have been described which may be related to the decompression technique used. Femoral head decompressions were performed on 12 matched human cadaveric femora comparing large 8mm single bore versus multiple 3mm small drilling techniques. Ultimate failure strength of the femora was tested using a servo-hydraulic material testing system. Ultimate load to failure was compared between the different decompression techniques using two paired ANCOVA linear regression models. Prior to biomechanical testing and after the intervention, volumetric bone mineral density was determined using quantitative computed tomography to account for variation between cadaveric samples and to assess the amount of bone disruption by the core decompression. Core decompression, using the small diameter bore and multiple drilling technique, withstood significantly greater load prior to failure compared with the single large bore technique after adjustment for bone mineral density (p&lt; 0.05). The 8mm single bore technique removed a significantly larger volume of bone compared to the 3mm multiple drilling technique (p&lt; 0.001). However, total fracture energy was similar between the two core decompression techniques. When considering core decompression for the treatment of early stage avascular necrosis, the multiple small bore technique removed less bone volume, thereby potentially leading to higher load to failure.","676":"The introduction of modern endoscopy in neurosurgery brought light to one of the darkest areas: the skull base. In particular, the trans-nasal route allowed skull base surgeons to visualize and dominate the entire midline skull base. We analyzed our surgical series of 199 patients that were affected by several pathologies (pituitary adenomas, clivalchordomas, craniopharyngioma, Rathke's cleft cysts, tuberculum sellaemeningiomas, and craniovertebral junction pathologies with bulbar compression) and treated each by using a 3D-HD endoscope between December 2012 and December 2015 and reviewed the literature. We present our results in terms of tumor resections and decompression inpatients affected by craniovertebral junction pathologies. Analyzing our direct experience, as well as the literature, we can assert that the amount and accuracy of necessary movements in order to achieve a determined target are affected by the screen clarity and image resolution of the device. Additionally, the experience of the surgeon has an important role in the surgical outcome. Moreover, depth perception is critical in order to obtain precise and accurate movements. Our observations and the experts' opinion indicate that this modality provides improved surgical dexterity by affording the surgeon with depth perception while manipulating tissue and maneuvering the endoscope in the endonasal corridor, which is especially crucial in reducing the learning curve of young neurosurgeons.","677":"Mini-laparoscopy (Mini) was pioneered more than 20 years ago. Newer generation mini instruments have recently become available with improved effector tips, a choice of shaft diameters and lengths, better shaft insulation and electrosurgery capability, improved shaft strength and rotation, more ergonomic handles, low-friction trocar options, and improved instrument durability. Whether the use of mini instruments, particularly newer generation instruments, offers advantages for laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the subject of this review. The literature was searched for level I data comparing mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Mini LC) to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Std LC). Three systematic reviews and 19 randomized clinical trials were identified and these were studied to evaluate the science behind Mini LC. Mini LC requires conversion to Std LC in 12.3% of patients. Mini LC and Std LC require conversion to open cholecystectomy at the same rate (2-3%). As compared to Std LC, Mini LC: (1) takes 3.4-4.9 minutes longer to perform; (2) has the same rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications; (3) may result in slightly less pain in the first 24 hours after surgery; (4) has the same duration of hospital stay, pain scores 1-28 days after surgery, time to return to activity, time to return to work, and postoperative quality of life 10 days after surgery; (5) provides a better early cosmetic result (as graded by patients and by blinded observers); and (6) provides no apparent difference in late cosmesis (as evaluated 6-12 months postop). There are minimal level I data published on the effects of newer mini instruments for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. When applied to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the use of mini-laparoscopic instruments results in a slightly longer operative procedure (3-5 minutes), slightly less immediate postoperative pain (in the first 24 hours), and a better early cosmetic result, with no other apparent significant differences. Additional data are needed from large, well-conducted studies of Mini LC to resolve several unanswered questions, including the role of newer mini instruments. ","678":"Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) remains a safe, reproducible, and popular method employed by surgeons to repair abdominal wall hernias. Patient selection, operative technique, instrumentation, and implant choice all remain surgeon dependent. Inherent in the technique is the option of using mesh. The decision of where to place the mesh and how to optimally fixate the mesh in the onlay, sublay, or intraabdominal positions also remain surgeon dependent and has been the subject of ongoing debates for the past two decades. In an ongoing effort to develop new methods for securing mesh to minimize pain without increased recurrence rates, novel mesh fasteners and mesh textiles have been developed. With increasing surgeon responsibility to improve value, surgeons should concentrate more on choosing the novel options that not only improve outcomes, but also reduce overall costs. This chapter reviews some of the emerging markets for these technologies.","679":"Choosing the correct surgical staple height is dependent on knowledge of specific tissue thickness and compressibility. The purpose of this study was to measure the thickness of cadaveric human lung tissue. Between December 2012 and February 2013, whole lungs were procured from 12 donors. Inclusion criteria included negative serology, no prior thoracic surgery, and completion of measurements within 72 hours of death. Tissue thickness was measured in the anterior-to-posterior direction using a tissue measuring device (TMD) at 41 lung locations. The tissue measuring device applied a constant pressure (8 g\/mm2) via a plunger for 15 seconds before reading the thickness. Cadaveric lung tissue thickness displayed a large variation by location and within each location. Mean thickness in the anterior-to-posterior direction ranged from 1.5 mm (right middle lobe [inferior peripheral] location) to 9.0 mm (right inferior lobe [mid-central] location). In general, the periphery of the lung lobes was thinner than the central locations (e.g., mean peripheral location thickness: 4.1 mm; mean central location thickness: 5.9 mm). The thinnest tissues among the 12 donor cadaveric lung specimens were found in the one donor with a history of severe emphysema\/chronic bronchitis. Height (P = 0.012) and weight (P = 0.036) were positively correlated with tissue thickness. Additionally, after adjusting for height, cadaveric lung tissue was 3.0 mm thicker for females than males. Large variations of lung tissue thickness were demonstrated throughout the lung as well as within each measured location across different cadaveric specimens. Generally, peripheral locations were thinner than the central locations of the lobes. There was a strong positive correlation between thickness and height, and females had slightly thicker lung tissue than males of the same height. ","680":"Melanoma is characterized by a high degree of chromosome instability (CIN), the loss or gain of entire chromosomes or pieces of chromosomes. Also, CIN is likely to drive the progression of benign melanocytic lesions to malignant tumors, although very little is known about the acquisition of the mechanisms that promote CIN along this progression. Here, we describe the development of a model system to study the progression of melanomagenesis starting with normal human melanocytes followed by inactivation of the p53 and pRb tumor suppressors by addition of the E6\/E7 proteins. The cells were then transduced with a growth-promoting, constitutionally-active mutant NRAS. The addition of E6\/E7 and E6\/E7 NRAS was found to give a growth advantage to the cells compared to normal melanocytes and a statistically significant gain of aneuploidy; aneuploidy was 24.7% in primary melanocytes, 33.8% in E6\/E7 melanocytes, and 70.5% in E6\/E7 NRAS melanocytes. Further, we found an increase in tetraploid cells in the cell model which was statistically significant between primary melanocytes and E6\/E7, NRAS melanocytes. We also observed an increase in aneuploid cells between three population doublings in primary melanocytes, whereas this increase was not seen in the E6\/E7 melanocytes. Together, these data demonstrate that this model system utilizing stepwise addition of genetic mutations driving melanomagenesis is a useful tool to study CIN and could even be used to study the mechanisms responsible for these alterations in genetic makeup.","681":"Outpatient total hip arthroplasty (THA) has remained controversial and challenging. Traditional hospital stays following total joint arthroplasty were substantial and resulted in increased rates of morbidity, significant pain, and severe restriction in mobility. Advancements in the surgical approach, anesthetic regimens, and the initiation of rapid rehabilitation protocols have had an impact on the length of recovery following elective THA. Still, very few studies have specifically outlined outpatient hip arthroplasty and, thus far, none have addressed the use of robotic-arm navigation in outpatient THA. This article describes in detail the technique used to perform outpatient THA with the use of robotic-arm assistance. We believe that outpatient THA using robotic-arm assistance in combination with tissue-preserving surgery, multi-modal pain and nausea management, early rehabilitation, and stringent patient selection yields a suitable alternative to inpatient joint replacement .","682":null,"683":null,"684":"The reamer-irrigator-aspirator (RIA) system has been recently developed to decrease the incidence of osseous thermal necrosis and fat embolism associated with intramedullary reaming of long bones in trauma cases. This is achieved by continuous irrigation and suction. Recently, the use of RIA has been expanded to harvest bone graft and debride the medullary canal of long bones in cases of osteomyelitis and intramedullary tumors. Additionally, the collection system of this device has been utilized for its ability to capture bone graft and marrow aspirate. The purpose of this study is to report a comprehensive literature review on the: 1) use of RIA for canal reaming prior to intramedullary nailing; 2) use of RIA for the treatment of intramedullary osteomyelitis of long bones; 3) use of RIA for bone graft harvesting; 4) osteogenic potential of the RIA aspirate; and 5) future applications of the RIA system.","685":null,"686":"The gender-specific total knee arthroplasty (TKA) debate focuses on differences in distal femoral mediolateral to anteroposterior aspect ratio between males and females. However, randomized studies have been unable to demonstrate significant differences in outcomes utilizing gender-specific implants. No studies have examined the effect of intermediate femoral component sizes on outcome. We compared outcomes before and after intermediate sizing availability. We identified 331 patients (413 knees) who underwent primary TKA between 2003 and 2004 with a single complete knee system. There were 121 males and 210 females. Three intermediate femoral sizes were added in March 2004 to the six initial options. Patients before March 2004 were assigned to group 1 (n=178), and after to group 2 (n=235). Follow-up averaged 8.5 years. Preoperative demographics and clinical scores were similar between groups. Knee Society (KS) clinical and functional scores improved in females in both groups, but there was no significant difference. Male patients in group 2 had a significant improvement in KS clinical scores compared to male patients in group 1 (group 1: 33.9, group 2: 41.1; p=0.01). Females in group 2 had significantly less need for manipulation, 1.9%, versus females in group 1, 8.7% (p=0.01). MUA rates were similar for men between groups. Overall, there were 19 revisions (4.6%) with no differences between groups or by genders. Once intermediate sizes were available, they were used in 48% of females and 13% of males. The average femoral component size for females in group 1 was 65 mm and decreased in group 2 to 62.5 mm. The average size of femoral components in males was 70 mm in both groups. Availability of intermediate size femoral component sizes was associated with a lower rate of manipulation in female patients. Greater KS clinical score improvement was observed in men after availability of additional femoral sizes. ","687":"Synthetic mesh utilized to treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) can often result in postoperative complications. The objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the most common indications for mesh removal; 2) the incidences of the removal of specific mesh procedures (such as suburethral sling [SUS], transvaginal mesh [TVM], or sacrocolpopexy); and 3) the idences and types of surgical complications associated with mesh removal. This was a retrospective study. Design Classification: Canadian Task Force II-3. Three tertiary referral centers in the United States. We examined data from all patients at the three centers who underwent surgical removal of synthetic materials from previous SUS, TVM, and sacrocolpopexy procedures for mesh-related complications from 2011 to 2013. Patients underwent vaginal, intra-abdominal, and inguinal mesh revisions by cutting, partial removal, or total removal of the mesh for mesh-related complications. Overall, 445 patients with complications underwent mesh removal laparoscopically, via groin dissection and\/or transvaginally. There were a total of 506 mesh products removed. Of these, 56.5% were slings and 43.5% were for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Synthetic mesh removed from patients included: transvaginal mesh (TVM) anterior for anterior vaginal prolapse, TVM posterior for posterior vaginal prolapse, sacrocolpopexy mesh, and suburethral slings (SUS) for stress urinary incontinence. Synthetic SUS removed included: retropubic (RPS), transobturator (TOT), and single-incision slings (SIS). TOT was the most common type of sling removed. Patients with a sling who only complained of vaginal pain with or without intercourse underwent a vaginal approach for surgical revision\/removal of the sling (86.6%). Patients with an RPS with lower abdominal\/suprapubic pain and vaginal pain underwent a vaginal and laparoscopic approach for sling removal (18.4%). Patients with a TOT sling who complained of vaginal and groin pain underwent a vaginal and inguinal approach for sling removal (4.3%). In patients who had POP mesh removal, 42.3% had an anterior TVM, 30.6% had a posterior TVM, 14% had both anterior and posterior TVMs, and 13.1% underwent sacrocolpopexy mesh removal. Complications encountered during mesh revision\/removal surgery were: two blood transfusions from complete RPS removal (vaginal and laparoscopic approach), three urethral injuries during TOT sling removal (vaginal approach), two ureteral injuries during anterior vaginal wall mesh removal, and two rectal injuries during posterior vaginal wall mesh removal. All injuries were repaired at the time of mesh removal without recurrence. In our study, the most common indication for mesh removal was pain with or without intercourse. The most common mesh procedure resulting in removal was the TOT sling. Use of a vaginal approach only for sling removal had the lowest incidence of intraoperative complications. Laparoscopic RPS removal had the highest incidence of required blood transfusions, anterior TVM had the highest incidence of ureteral injury, and posterior TVM had the highest incidence of rectal injury. Overall, sling, TVM, and sacrocolpopexy mesh removal are safe procedures when performed by experienced surgeons. ","688":"1) Evaluate the most common indication for sling removal in patients with synthetic mesh slings; 2) identify the location of pain for each of the three types of synthetic sling procedures including retropubic (RP) sling, transobturator (TOT) sling, and single incision slings (SIS), and 3) describe the surgical approach to each of the above and its associated complications. A retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent surgical removal of a sling due to a mesh-related complications from 2011 to 2013 at three referral centers. There were 337 sling complications followed by the IUGA\/ICS mesh complication classification. RP slings were more likely to have urinary tract complications (category 4) and intra-abdominal site complications (S5). Of those, 286 slings were removed, 106 (37.1%) were RP, 131 (45.8%) TOT, and 44 (15.4%) SIS. Vaginal pain was the most common reason for sling removal. Twenty-one percent of the TOT had groin pain which was a five times higher risk than RP (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.5-18.7), and the RP was three times more likely to have suprapubic pain than the TOT (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.3-7.0). Fifteen percent of the TOT had either unilateral or bilateral groin mesh removal. The most common indication for sling removal was vaginal pain. RP sling had a higher risk of suprapubic pain and TOT sling had a higher risk of groin pain. Patients with a history of SIS had a higher incidence of urethral erosion. TOT removal had the highest intraoperative complication rate. ","689":"Liver resection is the curative treatment for patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs), with five-year survival rates of 30-50%. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a local and useful alternative for patients with non-resectable CRLMs to obtain complete tumor clearance. The aim of this study was to analyze survival rates with this local treatment. All patients who underwent RFA and resection or RFA alone for unresectable CRLMs between 2001 and 2012 were included in a retrospective study. Descriptive and survival statistics were calculated. Morbidity, mortality, and recurrence were also analyzed. The study involved 72 patients and 179 lesions. RFA was performed in 109 procedures. Mortality was 2.7% and morbidity was 25.7%. Local recurrence concerned 25.7% of lesions. Independent risk factors for recurrence were more than one CRLM (p= 0.0427) and size of largest CRLM greater than 3 cm (p= 0.0139). The five-year overall survival rate was 45.5% and the five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 9.9%. This study shows RFA has good oncological outcomes. The combination of RFA and resection is considered as a curative treatment for patients with unresectable CRLMs. ","690":null,"691":null,"692":"Minimally invasive laparoscopic and robotic techniques for ventral hernia repair have evolved to achieve the benefits and minimize the limitations of both the open Rives-Stoppa sublay mesh repair and laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repair. By combining the principles of a retromuscular repair with the benefits of a minimally invasive approach, these techniques attempt to decrease recurrence, increase functionality, exclude mesh from the viscera, limit infection and wound complications, and minimize pain. The difficult ergonomics, challenging dissection, and extensive suturing make traditional laparoscopic sublay repair technically challenging and has led to increased robotic utilization to overcome these limitations. We describe a laparoscopic extraperitoneal sublay mesh repair technique using an endoscopic stapler to facilitate reapproximation of the linea alba and creation of the retromuscular space, and self-gripping mesh to position and fixate the prosthetic. Between January and June 2016, 10 patients with midline ventral and incisional hernias underwent laparoscopic extraperitoneal stapled sublay mesh repair with self-gripping mesh. Three of these cases included a laparoscopic posterior component separation with myofascial release of the transversus abdominis muscle to facilitate midline closure. Intraoperative and perioperative complications, early recurrence, pain, and narcotic usage were measured. There were no significant intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery. Patients were discharged at 1.2 days on average. Early postoperative complications included a hernia site seroma in one patient, which resolved without intervention. There were no early postoperative infections or recurrences. Compared with traditional laparoscopic IPOM repair, there was less acute postoperative pain and use of analgesics. Laparoscopic extraperitoneal stapled sublay mesh repair is a safe and effective method for the treatment of medium- to large-sized ventral and incisional hernias. This extraperitoneal stapled approach using self-gripping mesh facilitates a minimally invasive sublay repair and abdominal wall reconstruction using traditional laparoscopic tools. ","693":"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using tendon or ligament autograft is the gold standard surgical treatment for acute ruptures; however, this is still associated with subsequent problems and variable outcomes. Renewed interest in healing of injured ACL tissue has led to new surgical repair techniques. We report the case of one of the first patients to undergo this novel procedure of ACL repair with internal bracing. An internal brace is a bridging concept using braided suture tape and knotless bone anchors to reinforce ligament strength. We followed the case of one of the first patients to undergo this technique over two years post-operatively. In this case, we present a good functional outcome along with radiographic and arthroscopic evidence of a healed ACL with normal appearance. The successful application of this technique has been demonstrated. ACL repair techniques are re-emerging as a promising treatment option for acute proximal ruptures. Repair of the ACL can be performed successfully and has the advantage of retaining the natural proprioceptive fibres of the ligament. The internal brace acts as a secondary stabiliser after repair, which may allow accelerated rehabilitation and return to sports, whilst resisting injury recurrence when this is possible. Repair with internal bracing of the ACL provides an unobtrusive support which allows accelerated recovery. In this case, we demonstrate with radiographic and arthroscopic evidence, a robustly healed ACL after repair with internal bracing. Functional outcomes are excellent over two years following surgery and long term; retained proprioception may prevent re-injury and development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. ","694":null,"695":"Hemostasis is a critical component of all surgical procedures and especially cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional means, topical hemostatic agents have been reported to be extremely effective in terminating bleeding during cardiac procedures. We compared a hemostatic matrix sealant agent (HEMOPATCH Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL) with alternative topical hemostatic treatment in patients undergoing ascending aorta surgery with moderate bleeding. Following sample size calculation, in a prospective randomized study design, 85 patients were treated with HEMOPATCH matrix sealant and 85 patients received alternative treatment (dry or wet gauze compression or similar [control group]). The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients with successful hemostasis within three minutes of HEMOPATCH or traditional treatment application. Other study outcome measures were postoperative blood loss and the rate of transfusion of blood products. A statistically higher rate of successful hemostasis within three minutes was observed in the HEMOPATCH group (97.6% [83\/85] vs. 65.8% [56\/85] in the control group; p&lt; 0.001). The percentages of patients with postoperative bleeding and the rate of transfusion were lower in the HEMOPATCH group than in the control group. The use of HEMOPATCH is effective in terminating bleeding in patients undergoing ascending aorta cardiac procedures. Fewer patients treated with HEMOPATCH required blood transfusion. The cost-utility profile of HEMOPATCH should be addressed in dedicated trials. ","696":"Since 1989, the authors have been using the Trabucco tension-free and sutureless technique for the repair of primary groin hernia with a pre-shaped mesh in more than 8,000 surgical procedures for complex and \"simple\" abdominal and inguinal hernias; over 4,000 cases have been considered in this study. The great majority of these procedures were performed under local anaesthesia and with a complete and careful nerve sparing. Compared to the Lichtenstein's technique, which is currently the golden standard treatment worldwide, there are no significant differences in the observed recurrence rate (below 2%). For the Law of Pascal, the pre-shaped prosthesis developed by Trabucco remains stretched uniformly in the inguinal canal, without the need to be secured with sutures and without forming dead space, which is a cause of infections, pain, and recurrence. The main advantage of a tension-free and sutureless repair is given by the relevant reduction in postoperative chronic neuralgia, which is not an uncommon complication and, depending on its intensity, can also potentially jeopardize a patient's work and social activities. The identification and the sparing of the three nerves of the inguinal region is of crucial importance to reduce the rate of neuralgia in the short and long term. Furthermore, the use of a local anaesthesia imposes the surgeon to properly recognize those nerves and to respect them during the repair. It goes without saying that the complete exposition of the right anatomy of inguinal canal is mandatory. The intentional section of one or more nerves, when it is not technically possible to achieve a satisfactory nerve sparing, or special tricks to create proper fenestrations (small window) on the edge of the prosthesis to prevent the scar tissue to involve the spared nerves, ensures a further reduction of the rate of neuralgia and excellent patient outcomes. ","697":"The introduction of knotless barbed suture into the surgical market has decreased the challenges of laparoscopic suturing. Since its introduction, barbed suture has gained popularity in the field of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery and is now commonly used to close the vaginal cuff in total laparoscopic hysterectomy, to re-approximate the myometrium after laparoscopic myomectomy, and to shorten the procedure time during a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. Barbed sutures facilitate rapid and consistent wound closure, allowing for equal distribution of tissue tension across the suture line, and thereby providing a more secure wound closure. The most commonly encountered complication after the use of barbed sutures is postoperative bowel obstruction. Proposed methods to decrease the likelihood of this complication include ensuring that the ends of the barbed suture are either buried, over-sewn, or cut flush with the tissue. ","698":"It is a well-established fact that women who have large, heavy breasts suffer from spine pain. The objective of this study is to assess the forces that the breast exerts on the spine. It is important that such women understand the stresses that the spine is forced to sustain because of heavy breasts. The study was conducted using finite element analyses (FEA) of a human spine under different loads, loads being defined as incremental weights being sustained by the spine. The goal was to assess the influence of female breast size and weight on the forces and stresses sustained by the spine. The magnitude of forces generated by the breast to the thoracic spine ranged between 8.5 pounds of force for underwire size 30 to 110 pounds of force for underwire size 60. All increments in between were assessed in Newton of force and pounds of force. The magnification factor of forces generated by breast weight is 10X. Using the American bra sizing system a woman with a breast size of 36H would expect 52 pounds of force on the spine (for both breasts) while with weight loss she might reduce her breast size to 36D, with a corresponding reduction of force to 28 pounds of both breasts; that is, a total stress reduction of 24 pounds to the spine. On the other hand, surgical enlargement of size 34B breasts (18.4 pounds) to 34F (32.1 pounds) leads to an increase of ~14 pounds of force on the spine.

While a variety of technologies have been developed to improve diagnostic abilities and monitoring of wounds, none have proven completely effective in all settings. Further, many of the stalwart wound management techniques remain costly, time consuming, and technically challenging. The two key pivotal events of ischemia and infection can lead to limb loss. A relatively new crop of fluorescence-based technologies, including devices that measure pathogenic auto-fluorescence, fluorescence angiography, or map cutaneous oxygenation, are increasingly being utilized for adjunct wound assessment-both clinical and operative settings can address these events. These technologies offer rapid, efficient, visual, and quantitative data that can aid the wound provider in evaluating the viability of tissues, ensuring adequate perfusion, and optimizing wound bed preparation. In the following review, pathogenic auto-fluorescence is compared to gross evaluation of wound infection and culture based diagnostics, indocyanine green fluorescence angiography is compared to various methods of visual and physical assessments of tissue perfusion by the practitioner, and cutaneous oxygenation is compared to clinical signs of ischemia. We focus on the current applications of fluorescence technologies in wound management, with emphasis placed on the evidence for clinical and operative implementation, a safety analyses, procedural limitations, and the future direction of this growing field of wound assessment.

To this end, a broad range of biologic ECM scaffolds have been developed that can provide other therapeutic options aside from traditional wound care approaches. These tissue engineered ECM scaffolds aim to facilitate the restoration of functional skin-like tissue by altering the chronic wound environment and facilitating cellular attachment, proliferation, and differentiation.

","702":"The purpose of our study was to compare the effect, on the inflammatory response and fibrosis formation, of four commercially available sealant products applied on an injured trachea in a Wistar rat population. We compared four different sealants: cyanoacrylate, fibrin\/thrombin, albumin\/glutaraldehyde, and polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel (PEG). Rats were organized into six groups of similar size. Four of them were experimental, one was a baseline control group (BCG), and the sixth one was a reference control group (RCG). The RCG and experimental groups underwent the same surgical intervention with tracheal puncture, but no sealant was applied in the RCG. The BCG underwent the same cervical and peritracheal dissection without tracheal puncture. Rats were euthanized after eight weeks. The operation was performed on 54 rats, of which 12 died, leaving a final sample of 42 rats. Macroscopic analysis revealed no superficial tracheal or vascular fistulas, nor signs of local abscess. Although the groups treated with cyanoacrylate, fibrin\/thrombin, and albumin\/glutaraldehyde showed some degree of fibrosis, the treated area of the PEG group showed neither inflammatory nor scar signs. Microscopic assessment of the BCG and RCG showed no remarkable findings. With the exception of the PEG group, which had a light fibrosis and poor inflammatory response as did the BCG and RCG groups, the other groups showed varying degrees of fibrosis and cicatrization. Our study showed that the group treated with PEG had a mild inflammatory and fibrotic response, which is useful in tracheal or tracheobronchial surgical procedures. However, groups treated with cyanoacrylate, fibrin\/thrombin, and albumin\/glutaraldehyde showed fibrosis and cicatrization.

The incidence is high (30-50%) and depends on the length of follow up. Different surgical options for repairing are defective with a 25-70% failure and recurrence rate. Prevention of parastomal hernia with mesh reinforcement seems to be effective. Three available trials are recruiting patients: Prism (with matrix porcine prothesis), Prevent (with preperitoneal polypropylene mesh), and the stapled polypropylene mesh stoma reinforcement technique (SMART). We performed the SMART procedure in six patients undergoing definitive colostomy. Our cases show that the procedure is rapid (duration range 15-20 minutes), cost effective (500 euro), and safe (in our experience, there are no post-surgical complications that are procedure-related). A long term follow-up and a higher number of patients will give us confirmation of the initial hopeful results. ","704":null,"705":null,"706":"Elevated diaphragm can be due to diaphragmatic eventration or diaphragm paralysis. Diaphragm paralysis is a rare condition that can be congenital or acquired. Acquired diaphragmatic paralysis can result from injury to the phrenic nerve. Subsequently, there is loss of contractility of the diaphragm muscle leading to progressive atrophy and, hence, distension of the dome of the diaphragm leading to elevated right, left, or both copula of the diaphragm. Diaphragm plication aims to return the abdominal contents back to their normal position and allow for greater lung expansion by reducing the abundant diaphragmatic surface. Traditionally, diaphragm plication was performed through thoracotomy, until 1996 when Moroux introduced the widely used thoracoscopic technique of diaphragm plication. With the advancement of minimally-invasive surgery over the years, the approach to diaphragm plication has evolved from four ports to an uniportal approach and robotics. ","707":"There have been a variety of absorbable and permanent tacks, tack deployment systems, and fasteners developed for the fixation of mesh during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The manufacturer recommendation for all systems is for perpendicular deployment of these tacks into the tissue. Achieving this optimal angle with previously developed deployment systems is often challenging and can lead to tack failure, mesh migration, and recurrence, or may require the placement of additional ports. Additionally, current tack deployment systems lack the ability to reload, leading to increased cost when entire systems must be opened each time a reload is necessary. This article presents products designed to addresses both of these problems. These deployment instruments incorporate an articulating shaft or a hinge mechanism allowing for improved access to different parts of the abdominal cavity and delivering perpendicular placement of tacks with fewer port sites. Devices with the option of reloadable fixation decrease costs and reduce waste. ","708":null,"709":"Schwannomas are benign nerve myelin sheath tumors that can occur anywhere in the peripheral nervous system. It is very rare for Schwannomas to become malignant, but surgery is still the principal treatment to eliminate symptoms and to correctly diagnosis the tumor. We report an interesting case of a schwannoma of the saphenous nerve at the distal third of the posteromedial thigh: the patient complained of muscle weakness at left lower limb and vague anteromedial knee pain, mimicking a meniscal tear. Magnetic resonance images of the thigh showed a well-defined and oval mass lesion measuring 8.5 cm x 4.5 cm. Before investigating for a possible meniscal tear, we decided to remove the mass from the thigh, because we felt that it could itself be the cause of the mild pain complained about by the patient. Post-surgery, histological analysis conducted confirmed that this was a benign schwannoma. Schwannomas generally can be asymptomatic or present as a mass. The clinical presentation of this rare tumor makes the diagnosis difficult. This reported case is particularly interesting because of the rarity of the lesion localization along the course of the saphenous nerve. The combination of the location, and especially the large size of the tumor, led us to believe that there is a correlation with the particular clinical presentation. ","710":null,"711":"The surgical management of pseudoarthrosis is often a challenge. The use of mesenchymal multipotent cells expanded and manipulated in the laboratory is an interesting treatment of pseudoarthrosis, because they can lead to differentiation into osteocytes and thus the formation of bone tissue. We present a case of a 47-years-old man with isolate ulna fracture, treated with plate and screws and evolved in non-union. The patient underwent an expanded stem cells graft on the site of non-union with a small incision of approximately 3cm, without changing the synthesis system. After one year, the X-ray showed a complete fracture consolidation. In our opinion, this case is interesting because it highlights the cellular action that is the only healing factor; it is an important demonstration of the biological action of expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). To validate the use of MSCs, it is necessary to perform comparative studies for age, sex, general condition, location, and mechanism of injury as a further clinical validation of the efficiency of this cell line. ","712":"Endometrial polyps (EPs) are a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women and are typically suggested by a screening transvaginal ultrasound. In addition, the increasing use of pelvic imaging often discloses asymptomatic EPs. In the past, saline infusion sonography (SIS) has been advocated in order to triage patients to undergo a blind curettage or a diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy. The introduction of small diameter hysteroscopes and resectoscopes-often no larger than a SIS catheter-now allows most women with abnormal ultrasound findings to undergo a single-stage \"see-and-treat\" hysteroscopy for the management of endometrial polyps. In order to provide optimal management of endometrial polyps, however, a variety of known and unknown factors must be considered prior to \"see-and-treat\" hysteroscopy. For a woman wishing to preserve or enhance her fertility, hysteroscopic polypectomy-with care to avoid collateral endometrial damage-remains the standard of care. However, the literature reveals three issues that are important to address. First, that many premalignant and malignant lesions are found at the polyp base. Second, that there is a significant recurrence risk following simple polypectomy; this is especially true in tamoxifen-treated women. Third, that polypectomy alone is often insufficient for the satisfactory management of AUB. By offering a variety of options to women undergoing hysteroscopic polypectomy-including partial or total endomyometrial resection-the author addresses many of the limitations of traditional polypectomy. Moreover, the use of small diameter hysteroscopes and resectoscopes allow these procedures to be performed as a single stage \"see-and-treat\" hysteroscopy in the comfort and safety of an office-based setting. ","713":"Although laparoscopy is widely established for ablative urologic procedures, pelvic reconstructive procedures are still mostly performed by open-surgery. As urologists continue to introduce advanced laparoscopic skills to reconstructive urologic procedures, we present our experience with a laparoscopic psoas hitch double ureteral re-implantation in a patient with an ureterovaginal fistula and an ipsilateral duplex urinary system. A 42-year-old patient presented with continuous involuntary urine loss from the vagina after an abdominal hysterectomy. A double modified Lich-Gregoir ureteral re-implantation with a psoas hitch was performed, using a 4-port laparoscopic approach. There were no post-operative complications and the cystography at post-operative day 14 revealed good positioning of the psoas hitch, with no leak or reflux. At three-months follow-up, the patient is completely dry and asymptomatic. Laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy with psoas hitch for the treatment of lesions of the distal ureter is a possible, safe, and effective way to resolve a complex urologic situation with minimally invasive surgery. Laparoscopy is becoming the standard approach to urologic pelvic reconstructive procedures, even in the most complex cases. ","714":null,"715":"The open abdomen is a widespread therapeutic resource; however, it is also a source of complications, of which the enteroatmospheric fistulas (EAFs) pose one of the greatest problems. The objective of this study was to describe the implemented strategy for handling enteroatmospheric fistulas, and secondarily, to analyze the differential results based on a change in the conservative local treatment specifically designed for the stated complication. From March 2002 to March 2014, patients treated for EAF were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (G1: 2002 - 2007), treated with an occlusive vacuum device (SIVACO), similar to that used for other enterocutaneous fistulas, and Group 2 (G2: 2008 - 2014), covered in a specific modality for EAF. Results of conservative and surgical treatment were described and then the two groups were statistically compared. Study participants comprised 62 patients. Twelve cases (19.4%) healed with conservative treatment. This was statistically related with a baseline albumin level &gt;3 g\/dL, single lesions with no visible mucosa and baseline output &lt;700 mL\/d. In G1, the output fall was higher, while G2 required fewer wound dressing changes and enteral nutrition was feasible in a significantly higher number of patients. Forty-seven patients underwent reconstructive surgery. The mortality-associated variables were preoperative hypoalbuminemia and 2 or more anastomoses. Overall mortality was 8% (5 patients). In the multivariate model, only initial output (&lt;700 mL\/d) was an independent predictor for spontaneous closure, whereas 2 or more anastomoses and hypoalbuminemia were negative independent predictors. Systematic management of enteroatmospheric fistulas, following a rigorous protocol and a two-step specific treatment, resulted in a practical approach and yielded good results in healing and mortality. ","716":"Optimal revascularization strategy in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease remains a matter of debate, with advantages and disadvantages in both surgical and percutaneous procedures. A combined approach to achieve coronary revascularization, termed \"hybrid coronary revascularization\" (HCR), has been recently introduced in clinical practice. HCR is defined as a scheduled combination of surgical left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending (LIMA-LAD) grafting and percutaneous treatment of at least one non-LAD coronary arteries, with both procedures planned and performed within a defined time limit. HCR is indicated in case of both proximal LAD disease eligible to surgical LIMA-LAD grafting and non-LAD disease amenable to percutaneous procedures. Reviews and metanalysis of the literature showed that HCR is non-inferior to conventional surgical myocardial revascularization, and in case of high-risk patients, HCR can be the ideal option. However, the various technical approaches and time-related steps need to be further evaluated. Present and future research in interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery will turn into parallel improvements in HCR procedures. Surgical revascularization with off-pump techniques and minimally-invasive approaches, scoring systems such as SYNTAX II, tools evaluating the hemodynamic significance of atherosclerotic plaques with physiology-based approaches such as fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio, newer generation drug eluting stents, newer antiplatelet agents, and therapies might improve indications and clinical outcomes after HCR procedures. This article reviews the current literature on HCR and aims to provide an overview about future developments. ","717":"Abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) is a rare condition included in the differential diagnosis of an abdominal wall mass and\/or pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. It usually occurs after pelvic surgery, most commonly caesarean section. Given the variable clinical presentation, diagnosis can be challenging if a high index of suspicion for AWE does not exist. Consequently, the correct diagnosis is often missed in the preoperative assessment. The presence of endometriosis in other locations can aid in the diagnosis, but other endometriotic lesions do not always exist. Image studies, particularly ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, can also be of help in the differential diagnosis. Even though new management techniques such as ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoablation seem to be promising, surgical excision is still the mainstay of treatment. When the aponeurosis is involved, lesion excision might need to be followed by wall closure with the use of a mesh to lessen tissue tension. We present two typical cases of AWE after caesarean section, one of them recurrent, in patients with concurrent endometriosis of other locations. Total lesion excision followed by polypropylene mesh closure has been performed, with very good post-operative outcomes. We aim to raise awareness towards this diagnosis and to highlight the importance of complete lesion excision and adequate closure of the abdominal wall.

This approach is used to treat primary benign and malignant diseases, but it can also be adopted to resolve colorectal complications, such as leak and fistula, bleeding and stenosis. A new reusable transanal platform formed by a new port and monocurved instruments has been invented and here presented. The first experience included 13 patients submitted to TAMIS for rectal adenocarcinoma (8), immediate colorectal leak (1), early rectovaginal fistula (1), late colorectal fistula (1), immediate colorectal bleeding (1), and benign stenosis (1). Mean age was 62.3 years (38-74), and mean BMI was 25.2 kg\/m2 (20.5-32.1). Mean operative time for transanal total mesorectal excision (TME) was 149.2 minutes (96-193) and for the other procedures 80.6 minutes (15-163). Mean operative bleeding was 51.1 cc (0-450). Mean hospital stay was 5.0 days (2-8). The 3 patients with coloanal anastomosis presented diarrhea postoperatively. No other early postoperative complications were registered. Pathologic report in the oncologic diseases showed that a mean number of 14.7 nodes (16-20) were removed. After a mean follow-up of 8 months (1-14), there were no late complications in any of the 13 patients treated. TAMIS is a feasible alternative approach to treat rectal cancer and a completely new technique to manage colorectal complications. Moreover, this new transanal platform offers surgeons a satisfactory working ergonomy, with no increase in cost of the procedures, because entirely reusable materials are adopted. ","720":"The surgical management of pilonidal disease ranges from minimally invasive techniques to wide excision with secondary wound healing. Hypothetical counterarguments for using the minimally invasive techniques are that these techniques only incompletely remove the sinus tract and that they allow the formation of subcutaneous cavities as a result of rapid closure of small skin incisions. In order to avoid these problems we used a vessel loop drainage after subcutaneous destruction of the sinus tract. In this technique we combined two procedures: a narrow excision of pilonidal orifices with the subcutaneous destruction of the sinus tract and the removal of hair as well as the long-term vessel loop drainage of the wound channel with repeated revisions of the wound channel for removing hair remnants. In order to assess the efficacy and morbidity of this method 5 patients with primary symptomatic pilonidal sinus underwent an operation as a pilot study. Up to the removal of the vessel loop the wound channel had been regularly inspected using a mosquito clamp. If during two successive inspections no hair from the wound was found the vessel loop was removed. No adverse events occurred such as abscess or recurrent pilonidal sinus. One female patient with a history of long-term use of morphine derivatives and psychotropic substances experienced persistent coccygeal pain that persisted longer than 6 weeks. The complete wound healing with the formation of a qualitative scar took place on the 21st postoperative day (for 3 patients) and on the 28th postoperative day (for 2 patients). Initial results suggest that this operation is an effective procedure for the treatment of primary simple pilonidal sinus disease and we will continue to systematically test it. ","721":"Suturing is an essential surgical technique, because there is no resection without the need for reconstruction. Therefore, every surgeon should master a set of suturing techniques so he can adapt his approach to the specificity of the situation. The development of laparoscopic surgery poses a new challenge as not all open techniques are amendable for laparoscopic use. We would like to propose a modified fisherman's knot, which has been optimised in our center for laparoscopic use. The technique can be used with every monofilament non-braided wire. The needle is placed through the tissue to be sutured and both wires are externalised through the trocar. First, a simple knot is placed by crossing the left over the right wire. Next, the left is turned around the right wire four times proximal to the starting knot and crossed to the left wire where an additional two turns are made moving away from the trocar. The knot is closed gently, making sure not to lock the knot. Then the instrument of Drouard is used to gently glide the knot over the right wire back through the trocar into the abdomen. After making sure that adequate pressure has been delivered to the knot, to firmly close the tissue, the wire must be cut at a length of at least 3 mm. A new wire should be used for every knot and in this manner several knots can be delivered to make sure the tissue is adequately closed. In our center, no known complications due to loosening or failure of these knots have occurred since we incorporated this knotting technique into our daily practice more than 20 years ago. ","722":"Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) can help post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients who have knee stiffness regain range-of-motion. However, despite undergoing MUA, patients may have persistent knee stiffness. Often, this persistent knee stiffness is treated with a repeat MUA. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate repeat MUAs by assessing: (1) demographic characteristics, (2) range-of-motion, (3) clinical outcomes, and (4) rate of revision surgery in post-TKA patients with persistent knee stiffness who either underwent a single MUA or repeat MUAs. One-hundred-and-sixty-seven post-TKA who had undergone an MUA between 2005 and 2011 at two institutions were reviewed. Patients were stratified into those who had a single-MUA (138 knees) and those who had a repeat MUA (29 knees). The mean follow-up period was 63 months (range, 36 to 90 months). The incidence of repeat MUA within this cohort was determined. Demographics and ROM were compared using Student t-test and Chi-square as appropriate. Functional outcomes were assessed using Knee Society scores (KSS) and compared between the two cohorts. Among the 167 patients who underwent a MUA, 29 (17%) required repeat manipulations. The repeat MUA cohort was younger and more likely to have osteonecrosis as the underlying cause of knee disease. For the repeat MUA cohort, 17 patients (59%) had achieved satisfactory mean gains in ROM after their repeat MUAs. These patients had also achieved excellent mean Knee Society objective and functional scores. However, another seven knees (24%) had further persistent knee stiffness requiring arthrolysis of adhesions and five patients (17%) had undergone revision of the polyethylene spacer or patellar component to improve range-of-motion. In this study, the majority of patients who had undergone a repeat MUA were able to achieve improvements in flexion range-of-motion and functional outcomes. However, the remaining patients required more invasive procedure to treat persistent knee stiffness. In patients who have persistent knee stiffness after MUAs, a repeat MUA may be helpful to increase range-of-motion and function. ","723":"The potential for using mobile applications (apps) as an effective tool to monitor patients in an outpatient setting is promising. Past studies have investigated the use of applications in preoperative and postoperative settings as well as in monitoring and treating chronic illnesses such as diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple sclerosis. However, there is limited data on its specific use in the context of total knee arthroplasty. Given the complicated nature and crucial role of patient adherence to protocols during the preparatory and recovery phases of the procedure, the use of an app can serve as a helpful tool in aiding patients throughout this process. We present a pilot study to assess the efficacy of using such an app in order to monitor patient adherence to total knee arthroplasty-specific preoperative and postoperative protocols. Preoperative protocols used in this study included a 5-item medication protocol and multiple activity instructions. Postoperative patient protocols included following instructions on topics such as recording responses to quality-of-life questions, when and how to contact the clinical team if patients had non-emergent concerns or questions, and carrying out daily physical therapy (PT) exercises. Patients received and recorded responses to these preoperative and postoperative instructions using the iGetBetter program application installed on an iPad Mini, provided to the participants. Patient adherence was based on the data gathered from the patient responses inputted on this app. Adherence rates were comparable to those reported in various past studies that also investigated rates of adherence to health management-related instructions communicated through mobile apps.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of TENS for the treatment of chronic low back pain. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and randomized crossover studies on TENS for the management of low back pain. We utilized a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain as our primary outcome. Effectiveness of treatment was quantified using improvement in outcome scores for each study. Of the studies that met the criteria, 13 allowed for calculation of weighted mean differences in pain reduction. We used a random model effect to evaluate changes in pain produced by the intervention. Included were nine level I and four level II, encompassing 267 patients (39% male) who had a mean follow-up of seven weeks (range; 2 to 24 weeks). The mean duration of treatment was six weeks (range; 2 to 24 weeks). The standardized mean difference in pain from pre- to post-treatment for TENS was 0.844, which demonstrated significant improvement of TENS on pain reduction. When subdividing treatment duration, patients that were treated for &lt; 5 weeks had significant effects on pain, while those treated for &gt; 5 weeks did not. Treatment of chronic low back pain with TENS demonstrated significant pain reduction. The application of TENS may lead to less pain medication usage and should be incorporated into the treatment armamentarium for chronic low back pain. ","726":"Opioids are commonly used in the postoperative period to manage postsurgical pain. However, adverse side effects of opioids include respiratory depression, urinary retention, pruritus, vomiting, nausea, constipation, and increased risk of falls. Surgical site infiltration with extended release liposomal bupivacaine is effective in the multimodal care plan of managing postsurgical patients. The purpose of the present study was to examine the possible effects of liposomal bupivacaine on postoperative opioid adverse events following open hernia repair and laparoscopic colon resection surgery. The study population comprised 82 patients who had undergone open hernia repair or a laparoscopic colon resection. Forty-five of the 82 patients were treated with liposomal bupivacaine. Data were examined retrospectively from January 1, 2012 to August 31, 2012 in comparison with historical controls. Adverse opioid events measured included constipation, pruritus, vomiting, nausea, urinary retention, respiratory depression and fall risk. Statistical tools used were the Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's chi-squared test, and Fisher's exact test. The addition of liposomal bupivacaine did significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduce urinary retention and respiratory depression. Additionally, from the perspective of hospital safety there was a significant reduction in patients at high risk of falls, from 16% to 8.4% as well as an increase in patients at low risk of falls, from 37.6% to 48.7%. The findings of this study demonstrate that using liposomal bupivacaine can significantly reduce high-risk fall patients, increase low-risk fall patients as well as decrease urinary retention and respiratory depression in the postoperative setting. Given heightened consideration of the impact of sentinel events on hospital reimbursement since health care reforms in 2014, these results are important because they can mitigate complications associated with opioids in postsurgical pain management, and thereby reduce the costs of hospitalization.

However, these surveys can be a burden to both patients and orthopaedists as some are time-inefficient. In addition, there is a paucity of reports assessing the time it takes to complete them. In this study we aimed to: (1) assess how long it takes to complete the most common standardized hip questionnaires; (2) determine the presence of variation in completion time; and (3) evaluate the effects of age, gender, and level of education on completion time. Based on a previous study, we selected the seven most commonly used hip scoring systems-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Hip Outcome Assessment (WOMAC), Harris Hip Score (HHS), Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), Larson Score, Short-form 36 (SF-36), modified Merle d'Aubigne and Postel Score (MDA), and Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS). The standardized scales and questionnaires were randomly administered to 70 subjects. The subjects were unaware that they were being timed during completion of the questionnaire. We obtained the coefficients of variation of time for each questionnaire. The mean time to complete the questionnaire was then stratified and compared based on age, gender, and level of education. The mean time to complete each of the systems is listed in ascending order: Modified Merle d'Aubigne and Postel Score (MDA), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Hip Outcome Assessment (WOMAC), Harris Hip Score (HHS), Larson Score, Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), and Short-form 36 (SF-36). The WOMAC and Larson Score coefficients of variation were the largest, and the HOOS and MDA were the smallest. There was a significantly higher mean time to completion in those who were above or equal to the age of 55 years as compared to those who were below the age of 55 (227 vs. 166 seconds). There was no significant association found in time of completion between gender or education level. Standardized scales and questionnaire which assess THA patients can be burdensome and time-inefficient, which may lead to task-induced fatigue. This may result in inaccurate THA patient assessments, which do not reflect the patient's true state. Future studies should aim to create an encompassing questionnaire that is time efficient and can replace all currently used validated systems. ","730":"To ensure the continued success of total knee arthroplasties (TKAs), we must employ ever-evolving modifications to our techniques and implant designs. As part of this process, a knee prosthesis with a single radius (SR) has been developed to more precisely emulate the anatomy and biomechanics of the native knee, but there is little data on long-term outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate (1) the long-term (10-year) survivorship; (2) clinical and patient-reported outcomes; (3) radiographic outcomes; and (4) incidence of complications in patients who underwent TKA with this SR prosthesis. We evaluated 54 patients (67 TKAs) (24% men, 76% women) who had a mean age of 62 years at the time of surgery (range, 30 to 82 years). The mean follow-up was 10 years (minimum 9 years). All patients underwent a primary TKA using a newly developed single radius implant with posterior condylar flare. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine implant survivorship. The Knee Society Score (KSS), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, and Short Form-36 (SF-36) mental and physical component scores were used to evaluate clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were reviewed for evidence of component loosening. Complications were identified through a comprehensive chart review and were classified as either surgical or medical. Assessment of aseptic loosening revealed that survivorship of the tibial and femoral components was 100%. Evaluation of revisions for any reason showed that Kaplan-Meier aseptic and all-cause survivorship of the femoral and tibial components was 99%. When only polyethylene exchanges were included, the all-cause overall and aseptic survivorships were 94% and 96% respectively. Additionally, the mean KSS and UCLA activity scores were 64 (range, 5 to 100 points) and 5 points (range, 1 to 9 points) at final follow-up. The mean SF-36 mental and physical component scores were 53 (range, 23 to 66 points) and 39 points (range, 15 to 61 points). Surgical complications included arthrofibrosis, extensor mechanism disruption, patellar component revision, and peroneal nerve palsy. No medical complications were reported. Single radius total knee arthroplasties have demonstrated excellent long-term survivorship and functional outcomes, as demonstrated by this preliminary report. ","731":"Newer generation cementless femoral stems have been designed to emulate more precisely the anatomy of the native femur. However, few studies have evaluated these designs. The purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate outcomes of primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients who received a second-generation, tapered wedge stem by analyzing (1) all-cause and aseptic implant survivorships; (2) clinical and patient-reported outcomes; (3) radiographic outcomes; and (4) incidence of complications. We evaluated 202 primary THA patients (37% men, 63% women) who had a mean age of 63 years (range, 18 to 88) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 29 (range, 18 to 40). All patients underwent THA using a press-fit, tapered wedge stem with a morphometric design containing a size-specific medial curvature, which optimizes initial press-fit stability. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine implant survivorship, and Harris Hip Scores (HHS) and the Short form-36 (SF-36) were used to evaluate clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Early postoperatively and annually thereafter, pelvic radiographs were reviewed for evidence of osteolysis or loosening. Complications were identified through a comprehensive chart review and were classified as either surgical or medical. At final follow-up, the all-cause and aseptic survivorships for the femoral stem were 99.5% and 100%, respectively. At final follow-up, the mean HHS was 87 (range, 35 to 100). The SF-36 mental and physical component scores were 47 (range, 19 to 65) and 47 (range, 23 to 65), respectively, at final follow-up. No progressive radiolucencies or loosening were observed. Surgical complications included nerve palsy, posterior trochanteric avulsion, arthrofibrosis, and periprosthetic fracture. The only medical complication was acute renal failure. This second-generation stem demonstrated excellent short-term survivorship and functional outcomes. The improved patient fit of this stem may yield continued favorable results with longer-term follow-up. ","732":"Evaluating outcomes following total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been essential for improving satisfaction and quality of care. However, finding systems that fully encompass these outcomes poses a challenge for physicians, and often still do not provide an adequate picture of a patient's recovery. Therefore, we evaluated different scoring systems to determine the most efficient method of assessing the outcomes of patients undergoing THA. We evaluated all hip scoring systems currently available in the literature and identified the parameters assessed in the questionnaires. The parameters were then subdivided into subjective, objective, rehabilitative, and quality of life outcome measures. We identified the most commonly referenced questionnaires and assessed multiple permutations of these with other scoring systems to determine the combinations that would most efficiently and comprehensively evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing THA. The 42 identified scoring systems covered the following parameters: 4 subjective, 5 objective, 17 rehabilitative, and 18 quality of life. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) was the most cited system (5,613), but the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) had the greatest coverage of all the parameters (49%). On combinatorial analysis, the 2-, 3-, and 4-item permutations that had the greatest coverage were HOOS and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (59%), HOOS, SF-36, and Larson (75%), and HOOS, SF-36, Larson, and Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) (80%). Physicians and researchers have attempted to fully assess the outcomes of patients undergoing THA. Utilizing existing scoring systems in particular combinations may allow us to form an ideal questionnaire that provides sufficient coverage of parameters, thus providing a more comprehensive way to cost-effectively evaluate outcomes. Further analysis is required to determine whether or not these permutations provide a sufficient evaluation in a clinical setting.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of varying levels of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) release on the tibiofemoral kinematics and PCL strain. A computational analysis was performed and varying levels of PCL release were simulated. Tibiofemoral kinematics was evaluated. The maximum PCL strain was determined for each bundle to evaluate the risk of rupture based on the failure strain. The femoral AP position shifted anteriorly as the PCL stiffness was reduced. PCL strain in both bundles increased as stiffness was reduced. The model predicts that the AL bundle should not rupture for a 75% release. Risk of PM bundle rupture is greater than AL bundle. Our findings suggest that a partial PCL release impacts tibiofemoral kinematics and ligament tension and strain. The relationship is dynamic and care should be taken when seeking optimal balance intra-operatively. ","735":null,"736":"Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is a versatile modality that has applications across several medical fields. HBO therapy has become a valuable asset in the management of compromised tissue grafts and flaps. Although classified together, grafts and flaps are distinctly different, in that grafts depend on the wound bed for revascularization, whereas flaps have an inherent blood supply. Evidence has shown that in a compromised graft suffering from hypoxia, HBO can maximize viability and reduce the need for repeat grafting. By comparison, compromised flaps can suffer from both ischemic and reperfusion injury, which can also be attenuated by HBOT to maximize viability. The beneficial effects of HBO occur by several mechanisms, including hyper-oxygenation, fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and vasculogenesis. Animal studies have demonstrated several of these mechanisms, including an increase in the number, size, and growth distance of blood vessels after HBO. Likewise, clinical studies have found positive responses in multiple types of tissue grafts and flaps, with some cases involving irradiated fields. Altogether, the data emphasizes that early identification of flap or graft compromise is absolutely critical, with maximized chance for viability when HBO is initiated as soon as possible.

The purpose of this chapter is to review the role of fibrin sealant and its application in general surgery for mesh fixation, specifically the history, biomechanics, and clinical utilization. The utilization of fibrin sealant for repair of groin hernias, both open and laparoscopic, ventral hernias, and hiatal hernias will be discussed. ","740":"The sleeve gastrectomy has been accepted as a primary bariatric procedure. One of the most feared complications is staple line leakage. It is important to use the right staple sizes to minimize the risk of leak. Knowledge of gastric thickness is important. The goal of this study was to measure the thickness of the gastric wall after elimination of the gastric folds in the mucosa. An electronic thickness gauge was developed that measured the anterior and posterior wall of the fresh stomach specimen together at 5 points at a pressure based on the finger pressure necessary to flatten the gastric folds. Thirty-three fresh specimens were measured. The mean compression pressure was 714 grams, and no difference was found between the 5 measure points. There was a significant difference in stomach wall thickness. The gastric antrum was more than 1 mm thicker than the fundus. No difference was found between BMI groups &lt;40 Kg\/m2, 40-50 Kg\/m2, or &gt;50 Kg\/m2. No bleeding occurred, leakage occurred in 1 case. There is a significant difference in thickness of the stomach wall between the gastric fundus and the antrum. A pressure 2.5 times lower than applied in prior studies was necessary to achieve full tissue compression. Choosing thinner staple sizes for the gastric fundus might be the optimal technique for compression. However, there are several additional factors that influence the risk of staple line leaks.","741":"Spinal cord injury (SCI) during revision surgery for persistent multilevel cervical myelopathy (MCM) after an initial anterior procedure is rare. However, the pathophysiology of MCM, even prior to surgery, is a risk-factor for neurological deterioration due to the development of a \"sick cord\", which reflects pathological changes in the spinal cord that lower the threshold for injury. We report a case of persistent MCM despite a three-level ACDF and corpectomy who developed an incomplete C6 tetraplegia during revision cervical laminectomy and posterior instrumentation. Intraoperative neuromonitoring signal-changes occurred in the absence of mechanical trauma. Postoperative MRI of the cervical spine demonstrated increased T2 hyperintensity and cord expansion at C3 and C4 compared to the pre-laminectomy MRI. The patient has not made improvements in her neurological status at 13 months postoperatively. The pathophysiology of MCM is discussed in addition to perioperative imaging, neuromonitoring, and use of steroids. ","742":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor. Despite the best treatment and advances in therapy, prognosis remains poor. One of the mainstays of therapy in GBM is surgical excision. Several studies have confirmed that the extent of resection (EOR) positively influences overall survival (OS) in patients with high-grade gliomas (HGGs). A literature search was performed using PubMed to assess the useful neurosurgical tools to achieve the best neurosurgical performance. In order to achieve the major extent of resection, preserving neurological function, many tools are now available, especially neuronavigation, intraoperative fluorescence, intraoperative ultrasound, and neuromonitoring. In addition to the maximal excision of tumor, the neurosurgeon can use photodynamic therapy (PTD) and local drug delivery (LDD) to improve the local control and bridge conventional radio and chemotherapy. EOR improves OS in patients with HGGs. There are technological possibilities for achieving a complete resection preserving neurological function, and it is not acceptable to perform only biopsy of these lesions. ","743":"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is increasing in the United States, and some have proposed the use of unloader bracing as an adjunct to current standard treatments. Our purpose was to evaluate outcomes of this brace for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis compared with standard non-operative treatment. Specifically, we evaluated: (1) pain relief, (2) objective functional improvement, (3) subjective functional improvement, (4) quality of life, (5) isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength, and (6) gait changes. A prospective, randomized, study was performed on 18 patients who had Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 and 2 osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized to receive either standard treatment or an unloader brace. End points evaluated included: functional tests, Knee Society Score, Short Form 36 (SF-36) health survey, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, and 3-dimensional gait analysis. There were no differences between cohorts in evaluation of pain (VAS), objective functional tests, subjective functional outcomes (Knee Society Scores and LEFS), quality of life assessment with SF-36, isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, and gait parameters. The use of unloader brace demonstrated similar improvements compared with standard treatments for knee osteoarthritis, and we believe that it can be a beneficial or equivalent adjunct to continuum of care for the treatment for knee osteoarthritis. ","744":"We present a prospective study focused on radiographic long-term outcomes and bone remodeling at a mean of 17.0 years (range: 15 to 20) in 208 cementless fully HA-coated femoral stems (Corail, DePuy International Ltd, Leeds, UK). Total hip replacements in this study were performed by three members of the surgeon design group between 1986 and 1991. Radiographic evaluation focused on periprosthetic osteolysis, bone remodeling, osseous integration, subsidence, metaphyseal or diaphyseal load transfer, and femoral stress shielding. The radiographs were digitized and examined with contrast-enhancing software for analysis of the trabecular architecture. Radiographic signs of aseptic stem loosening were visible in two cases (1%). Three stems (1.4%) showed metaphyseal periprosthetic osteolysis in four of seven Gruen zones associated with eccentric polyethylene wear awaiting metaphyseal bone grafting and cup liner exchange. One stem (0.5%) was revised due to infection. No stem altered in varus or valgus alignment more than two degrees, and mean subsidence was 0.1 mm (range: 0 to 2 mm) after a mean of 17.0 years. A total of 5 stems (2.4%) required or are awaiting revision surgery. Trabecular orientation and micro-anatomy suggested main proximal load-transfer patterns in all except 3 cases (98.6%). Combined metaphyseal and diaphyseal osseointegration and bone remodeling were visible in 100 stems (48%). Diaphyseal stress shielding and cortical thickening were observed in 3 stems (1.4%). Other radiographic features are discussed in depth. This long-term study of 208 fully HA-coated Corail stems showed satisfactory osseointegration and fixation in 203 cases (97.6%) after a mean of 17.0 years follow-up. Stem failures were associated with extreme eccentric polyethylene wear. ","745":"The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is essential to maintain patella stability; however, its role in total knee replacement (TKR) has not been studied. Forty-six consecutive TKRs in 40 patients were reviewed. Standard closure was performed in 29 TKRs. The MPFL was isolated and anatomically re-approximated in 17 subsequent TKRs. Blinded radiographic evaluation of patellar tilt and subluxation was performed preoperatively and 4 months postoperatively. Despite greater preoperative lateral tilt, the MPFL repair group demonstrated greater correction in patellar tilt compared with the standard closure group (p = 0.02). Patellar tracking also was optimized in the MPFL group, despite equivalent preoperative lateral patellar subluxation in the two groups. Simple repair of the MPFL at arthrotomy closure appears to optimize patellar stability radiographically and may improve long-term results by minimizing patellar complications and wear. ","746":"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) may be treated without opioids through the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). However, no study has evaluated its clinical effect and economic impact as measured by opioid utilization and costs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients who were given TENS for CLBP compared to a matched group without TENS at one-year follow-up, to determine differences between opioid consumption. Opioid utilization and costs in patients who did and did not receive TENS were extracted from a Medicare supplemental administrative claims database. Patients were selected if they had at least two ICD-9-CM coded claims for low back pain in a three-month period and were then propensity score matched at a 1:1 ratio between patients who received TENS and those who did not. There were 22,913 patients in each group who had a minimum follow-up of one year. There were no significant demographic or comorbidity differences with the exception that TENS patients had more episodes of back pain. Significantly fewer patients in the TENS group required opioids at final follow-up (57.7 vs. 60.3%). TENS patients also had significantly fewer annual per-patient opioid costs compared to non-TENS patients ($169 vs. $192). There were significantly lower event rates in TENS patients compared to non-TENS patients when measured by opioid utilization (characterized by frequency of prescription refills) (3.82 vs. 4.08, respectively) or pharmacy utilization (31.67 vs. 32.25). The TENS group also demonstrated a significantly lower cost of these utilization events ($44 vs. $49) and avoided more opioid events (20.4 events fewer per 100 patients annually). Treatment of CLBP with TENS demonstrated significantly fewer patients requiring opioids, fewer events where a patient required an opioid prescription, and lower per-patient costs. Since TENS is both non-invasive and a non-narcotic, it may potentially allow physicians to be more aggressive in treating CLBP patients. ","747":null,"748":"The decision point with inter-hospital arthroplasty patient transfers and its financial implications have not been well studied. Factors outside of complexity of medical and surgical care are believed to drive the transfer of orthopaedic patients to tertiary care centers. We compared our institutional cost and resource utilization between transfer and elective patients in need of arthroplasty care. We hypothesized that transfer patients will incur a higher direct cost and resource utilization compared to elective patients, and that socioeconomic factors will play a role in the decision of transfer. After analysis of key metrics, transfer patients at our institution did not have any significant differences in insurance types. However, they did incur a longer length of stay (p&lt;0.0001) and incurred greater direct costs (p&lt;0.0001) to the hospital. After analysis of key parameters, transfer patients were more complex and costly to care for compared to our in-system patients. ","749":"Many scoring systems have been developed that serve to evaluate outcomes following total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, most systems focus on specific aspects of a patient's recovery rather than investigating a broad spectrum of parameters, which prevent physicians from obtaining a sufficient impression of a patient's recovery. Therefore, we evaluated existing scoring systems to assess the outcome categories included and parameters of interest. We examined all hip scoring systems currently available in the literature. The outcomes measured in each scoring system were sub-classified into one of four categories; subjective, objective, rehabilitative, and quality of life. We determined the number of scoring systems that incorporated each of these four categories and we assessed the most common parameters in each. The categories and individual parameters were assigned a relative weighted mean score based on how often they were incorporated, in an effort to determine their importance. We identified 42 hip scoring systems consisting of 44 individual parameters, which were divided into the above four categories. Of the relevant scoring systems, 74% included subjective parameters, 31% included objective parameters, 90% included rehabilitative parameters, and 62% included quality of life parameters. The most commonly assessed subjective parameters include pain, stiffness, and general hip difficulty. The most commonly assessed objective parameters include general\/combined ROM, flexion\/extension, and abduction\/adduction. The most commonly assessed rehabilitative parameters include the ability to walk, the ability to climb stairs, and the ability to reach to the floor. The most commonly assessed quality of life measures include the ability to use a car, performance of light domestic duties, and performance of heavy domestic duties. The category of rehabilitative practices carried the greatest weighted mean (49%) in hip scoring systems, followed by subjective (40%), quality of life (6%), and objective (5%). With regard to individual hip outcome parameters, pain carried the greatest weighted mean (23%), followed by the ability to walk and the ability to perform general activities (11% each). Patient outcomes can be evaluated by the use of scoring systems in an effort to determine the effectiveness of THA in regaining function and improving quality of life. Determining the frequency and importance of parameters in current scoring systems may allow for a more accurate and purposeful assessment of post-operative function and patient satisfaction. Understanding what is evaluated in existing scoring systems may shed light on the future development of a comprehensive outcome questionnaire. ","750":"We present here a case of pseudotumor formation likely due to metal wear debris generated at the head-neck taper (trunnion) of the femoral stem and head components in a metal-on-polyethylene (MOP) total hip arthroplasty. Over the last few years, this recently described diagnosis, trunnionosis, has been recognized and reported more frequently. This patient presented with a rather large (12-cm diameter) pseudotumor with accompanying loss of abductors and a pelvic discontinuity making reconstruction more challenging. We believe the psuedotumor in this patient developed from trunnionosis. This is an interesting case of aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated lesions (ALVAL) in a MOP total hip arthroplasty. ","751":"In revision total hip arthroplasty (THA), consensus is lacking regarding the optimal method for reconstruction of the most severe acetabular defects. Porous tantalum (TM) buttress augments were designed for the most severe postero-superior defects. The purpose of this study was to report the results of a consecutive series of acetabular reconstructions utilizing TM buttress augments. Eight complex acetabular reconstructions utilizing a TM buttress augment were performed at two centers. All were Paprosky 3A or Paprosky 3B bone loss classification, with severe superior and posterior column deficiency where wedge augments were insufficient for mechanical support. The acetabular cup sizes ranged from 64-78, and a buttress shim was used in 7 of 8 cases. Clinical and radiographic follow-up averaged 16.5 months (range, 10-28) and no cases were lost to follow-up. There were no cases of clinical or radiographic loosening, and no case had required reoperation or revision. All patients except one were ambulating with either no assist device or a single cane at final follow-up. There was one complication of an iliac wing fracture noted incidentally on postoperative x-rays in the lone patient in whom a buttress shim was not used. At short-term follow-up, TM acetabular buttress augments appear to effectively substitute for the use of structural allografts or cages, which would otherwise be used in this challenging setting. The potential for biologic fixation is promising for the durability of these reconstructions; however, longer-term follow-up is required for full evaluation. ","752":"To ensure good rehabilitation and improved outcomes following total hip arthroplasty (THA), optimal pain control is necessary. Newer methods of pain control have been advocated, as current modalities have been associated with undesirable side effects and serious complications. One such modality is liposomal bupivacaine, which provides long-acting, slow-release analgesia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate: (1) lengths of hospital stay and (2) the discharge status of patients who underwent THA with liposomal bupivacaine compared to a cohort who received standard analgesic regimens. We utilized a hospital discharge database from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014, which included 7,704,919 patients for our analysis. We selected patients aged 18 years or older who had an inpatient stay for THA using ICD-9 procedure code (ICD-9-CM = 81.51), which resulted in 55,129 THA patients. Patients who had a nerve block in the time period from the surgery date to the discharge date were then excluded, which resulted in 54,604 THA patients. The THA cohort who received liposomal bupivacaine suspension consisted of 5,267 patients (2,907 women; 2,360 men) who had a mean age of 64 years, while the THA without injections or nerve block consisted of 49,337 patients who had a mean age of 65 years that consisted of 27,530 women and 21,807 men. We analyzed length-of-stay by controlling for race, region, age, sex, Charlson Index, and operating time using a log link linear model with a negative binomial distribution. The discharge status to home compared to short-term nursing facility or rehabilitation was analyzed using logistic regression while controlling for the aforementioned covariates. The mean lengths of stay, after adjusting for covariates, for the liposomal bupivacaine cohort was significantly shorter than the no injection cohort. The distribution of patients being discharged to home compared to a short-term nursing facility or a rehabilitation facility was higher in the liposomal bupivacaine cohort compared to the cohort who did not receive liposomal bupivacaine. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated a higher likelihood of being discharged to home in liposomal bupivacaine cohort when compared to no injection. Liposomal bupivacaine appears to be an effective pain relief modality that leads to reduced lengths of hospital stay and increased rates of discharge to home. This may be an appropriate addition for the analgesic armamentarium in patients who undergo THA. ","753":null,"754":"Successful tenodesis of the proximal biceps relies on accurate reproduction of the native length-tension relationship of the long head of the biceps (LHB). While open tenodesis procedures can reproduce this relationship by referencing the position of the LHB musculotendinous junction (MTJ) to a visible anatomic landmark, arthroscopic suprapectoral tenodesis does not afford such advantage because the MTJ is usually not visible. No studies to date have evaluated the position of the MTJ of the LHB following arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis. Patients undergoing arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis between January 2013 and May 2014 at one center were evaluated for inclusion. Patients included in the study underwent a postoperative MRI of bilateral shoulders. The distance from the superior portion of the humeral head to the LHB MTJ was measured bilaterally. The measurements from each matched pair were compared using a paired t-test to determine if arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis anatomically restored the LHB length-tension relationship. A total of 17 patients met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen of the seventeen patients underwent a postoperative MRI of bilateral shoulders. The distance from the superior portion of the humeral head to the LHB musculotendinous junction was significantly larger on the operative side when compared to the nonsurgical side (operative side mean 98.34 mm, standard deviation 13.38 mm; nonsurgical mean 87.26 mm, standard deviation 9.09; mean difference 11.08 mm; p=0.0105). The musculotendinous junction of the LHB in patients who underwent arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis was located significantly more distal than the contralateral control, as measured on MRI. ","755":"Readmission rates remain a concern following total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study: 1) evaluated 30-day, 90-day, and total readmission rates after THAs; 2) assessed causes of readmission; 3) determined differences in demographic factors between those who were and were not readmitted; and 4) compared readmission rates to other large-scale studies. We retrospectively reviewed 232 primary THAs (224 patients) using the same prosthesis at 7 institutions. This included 79 men and 145 women who had a mean age of 69 years (range, 44 to 88). Descriptive analyses were used to evaluate readmission, and rates were compared with those from large cohort studies. There were 11 unplanned readmissions (4.7%) in 10 patients during the first 90 days post-discharge. Seven (3%) readmissions were due to surgical and 4 (1.7%) were due to medical reasons. Surgical causes were found in 70% of early (0 to 30 days) readmissions but none of late (60 to 90 days) readmissions. No differences existed in mean age, gender, and body mass index between readmitted patients and the remainder of the population. We observed lower readmission rates when compared with large cohort studies. The positive performance of the prosthesis may have contributed to the lower readmission rates. ","756":null,"757":"With the growing epidemic of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, there is an ever-increasing prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower extremities. The complications of PAD can be devastating and can increase the economic burden on the healthcare system. Traditionally, open revascularization procedures have been the mainstay of treatment for lower extremity PAD. Cardiac comorbidities are common among patients with PAD and as such may prohibit open revascularization. With the advent of minimally invasive endovascular procedures, the threshold for revascularization opportunities has increased. Despite promising early results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), atherectomy, and stenting, long-term outcomes are hindered by neointimal hyperplasia, which accounts for high restenosis and thrombosis rates. The utility and efficacy of drug-eluting stents in decreasing restenosis rates has been well demonstrated for coronary artery disease. This article will present a review of the current literature available on the use of drug-eluting (polymer-free) and drug-coated (polymer) stents for lower extremity PAD. ","758":"As minimally invasive gynecologic surgery (MIGS) becomes more complex, and cases more difficult, surgeons must adapt to the challenges not only by using innovative equipment but also using the lessons learned from other disciplines. Many years after general surgeons learned the \"art of laparoscopy,\" it is clear that general surgeons in the United States-and those around the world-have surpassed the \"masters of laparoscopy\" (gynecologists) with their use of new techniques and new equipment. Surgeons are using less traumatic graspers and perform a higher percentage of surgeries laparoscopically than gynecologic surgeons. With the essential need for more integrated ergonomics and a suitable laparoscopic operating room environment, this article describes the benefits of using angled laparoscopes and includes basic techniques to enable gynecologic surgeons to master \"driving\" the angled laparoscope. ","759":"Leiomyomas are the most frequently solid tumors found in pregnancy. This kind of tumor has a wide incidence depending on the age, race, and type of population studied. Most of the cases have an asymptomatic course; however, they could develop different kinds of complications during the pregnancy such as severe abdominal pain, often due to degeneration or torsion with ischemia. In these cases, a surgical approach is required because these tumors do not respond to the conventional treatment. Very few of these cases are reported in the literature. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman pregnant 18 weeks, who experienced acute abdominal pain without initial reponse to regular analgesics. She was taken to the operating room, and under laparoscopic exploration, torsion of a subserosal myoma was observed. The fibroid was resected laparoscopically, and she was released from the hospital without complications. Unfortunately, she was readmitted 45 days later with signs of preterm labor because of a motorcycle accident. An emergency cerclage was performed, but the pregnancy was compromised with amnionitis and early fetal demise. We concluded that the laparoscopic approach could be a successful alternative treatment in selected cases. ","760":"Labia minora hypertrophy of unknown and under-reported incidence in the general population is considered a variant of normal anatomy. Its origin is multi-factorial including genetic, hormonal, and infectious factors, and voluntary elongation of the labiae minorae in some cultures. Consults with patients bothered by this condition have been increasing with patients complaining of poor aesthetics and symptoms such as difficulty with vaginal secretions, vulvovaginitis, chronic irritation, and superficial dyspareunia, all of which can have a negative effect on these patients' sexuality and self esteem. Surgical management of labial hypertrophy is an option for women with these physical complaints or aesthetic issues. Labia minora hypertrophy can consist of multiple components, including the clitoral hood, lateral prepuce, frenulum, and the body of the labia minora. To date, there is not a consensus in the literature with respect to the classification and definition of varying grades of hypertrophy, aside from measurement of the length in centimeters. In order to offer patients the most appropriate surgical technique, an objective and understandable classification that can be used as part of the preoperative evaluation is necessary. Such a classification should have the aim of offering patients the best cosmetic and functional results with the fewest complications. ","761":null,"762":"Paravaginal defects, commonly seen in patients with anterior vaginal wall prolapse, are due to the detachment of pubocervical fascia from the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis (ATFP), at or near its lateral attachment. The majority of anterior vaginal wall prolapse is thought to be caused by paravaginal defects. Richardson et al. first described and demonstrated the anatomy of the paravaginal defect, as well as described the initial technique of the abdominal approach to repair. Since that time, the laparoscopic approach for repair has been developed and described with success rates of laparoscopic paravaginal defect repair reported in the range of 60% to 89%. This minimally invasive approach to address anterior wall prolapse eliminates the need for a vaginal incision, reduces risk of vaginal shortening and can be completed at the same time as other laparoscopic procedures, such as hysterectomy, sacralcolpopexy, and\/or Burch Urethropexy. Compared to the open abdominal approach, there is improved visualization, less risk of bleeding, and faster recovery with the laparoscopic method. Compared to an anterior colporrhaphy, laparoscopic paravaginal repair is a much more anatomic repair of lateral defects and does not result in vaginal shortening. The laparoscopic paravaginal repair should be considered as the first-line treatment of anterior vaginal wall prolapse caused by lateral defects, including at time of laparoscopic\/robotic sacralcolpopexy.

It is a medical condition poorly known, and few published data about involvement of femoral nerve are available. We report an isolated unilateral endometriosis lesion of the left lumbar region infiltrating the femoral nerve in a 38-year-old woman. She described severe dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dischezia, and chronic pelvic pain with irradiation to the anterior part of the left thigh. After investigation, it was identified as a 5-centimeter endometriotic nodule involving the femoral nerve and the psoas muscle. The patient was treated by two laparoscopic surgeries with neurolysis of the involved somatic nerve by a multidisciplinary team, with improvement of the symptoms. Laparoscopic neurolysis is the first approach advocated in these cases, leading to relief of neurological symptoms resulting from nerve infiltration by endometriosis.","764":"Vaginal cuff dehiscence represents a serious, but infrequent complication after hysterectomy, with a reported increased incidence following a laparoscopic approach. Various risk factors have been proposed including laparoscopically placed suture, surgical experience, use of electrosurgery, surgical indication, and obesity. Technical aspects of the procedure itself have also been questioned such as the variable use of monopolar electrosurgery during colpotomy and the suture type or number of layers chosen to reapproximate the vaginal cuff. Nothwithstanding the tendency for cuff dehiscence to occur following laparoscopic approach, there remains a paucity of high-quality data that supports or refutes this finding or clearly defines the mechanism(s) by which this event occurs allowing for the proposal of objective guidelines for reducing risk. Various techniques have been proposed to decrease the risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence during endoscopic hysterectomy, including use of monopolar current on cutting mode, achievement of cuff hemostasis with sutures rather than electrocoagulation, use of a two-layer cuff closure with polydioxanone suture, and use of bidirectional barbed suture for cuff closure. The authors experience at three university-based minimally invasive gynecologic surgery programs showed a low rate of vaginal cuff dehiscence in their own practices. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to truly determine whether there is a difference in vaginal cuff dehiscence between surgical modalities for hysterectomy as well as to determine the true risk factors. ","765":"Mesh bacterial colonization\/infection remains a critical issue in complex ventral hernia repair. Despite the recent emergence of biologic meshes, current strategies to prevent and treat mesh infection are largely ineffective, often leading to device failure and subsequent explantation along with the associated costs and effect on patient welfare. Unacceptably high rates of morbidity and hernia recurrence following mesh infection highlight the need for innovation in the area of hernia repair for the complex patient. One recent strategy to address such shortcomings is local antibiosis in the form of polymer coatings applied to the mesh itself. Current literature regarding the use of antibiotic-coated hernia mesh is limited but does illustrate the ability of these devices to inhibit bacterial growth and prevent mesh infection in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Although there is a paucity of literature regarding long-term clinical efficacy, this provides opportunity for further inquiry into a promising new development to combat mesh infective complications. ","766":"Surgery has consistently been demonstrated to be the most effective long-term therapy for the treatment of obesity. However, despite excellent outcomes with current procedures, most patients with obesity- and weight-related comorbidities who meet criteria for surgical treatment choose not to pursue surgery out of fear of operative risks and complications or concerns about high costs. Novel minimally invasive procedures and devices may offer alternative solutions for patients who are hesitant to pursue standard surgical approaches. These procedures may be used for primary treatment of obesity, early intervention for patients approaching morbid obesity, temporary management prior to bariatric surgery, or revision of bypass surgery associated with weight regain. Novel bariatric procedures can in general be divided into four categories: endoluminal space-occupying devices, gastric suturing and restrictive devices, absorption-limiting devices, and neural-hormonal modulating devices. Many of these are only approved as short-term interventions, but these devices may be effective for patients desiring low-risk procedures or a transient effect. We will see the expansion of indications and alternatives for metabolic surgery as these techniques gain approval.

These devices became widely accepted standard practice in many gastrointestinal operations, especially since the successful advent of minimally invasive surgery. Despite the relevant advantages related to the use of a surgical stapler, we must also consider that these instruments may be at risk of failure. When any component fails, the patient is at risk of operative morbidity. Gastrointestinal surgical stapling technique still needs refinement in order to increase its reliability. Staple line reinforcement has been widely used and seems to effectively reduce anastomotic complications. Literature provides us with examples of studies supporting both bleeding and leakage reduction after staple line reinforcement, but high-quality evidence is not available to date. Semi-absorbable and nonabsorbable materials have been the earliest available. The use of bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement materials has recently become more widespread, and these materials are more widely used these days. Powered staplers were made available to the market some time ago and represent a rather unheard of aspect of endosurgical stapling. Despite powered staples being supposedly convenient compared with manual ones only one relevant article was found when searching the U.S. National Library of Medicine for \"powered stapler.\" New surgical stapling devices are constantly developed and introduced on the market.

A 46-year-old female patient was diagnosed with colitic cancer of the transverse colon during the surveillance of ulcerative colitis. Six port sites were used. Mobilization of the left-sided colon through to the rectum and mobilization of the transverse colon with lymphadenectomy around the middle colic artery were performed using the robotic surgical system. After rectal mobilization was conducted near the anus, the right side of the colon was mobilized and the ileum resected laparoscopically. Thereafter, a mucosectomy of the proctorectum was carried out through a trans-anal approach, and a hand-sewn J-pouch was performed. Finally, a diverting ileostomy was constructed through the right lower abdomen. The operative time was 460 minutes, including the console time of 361 minutes. The amount of blood loss was 76 g. The patient was discharged on postoperative day nine. Pathological results demonstrated that the depth of the lesion was T3, and the positive lymph node was 1 of 115 retrieved lymph nodes.

","773":"Intermittent intraoperative neuromonitoring (I-IONM) has been introduced to thyroid surgery during the past two decades. The neuromonitoring devices (hardware and software) were significantly improved with the development of the second and third device generations. Needle electrodes, which were widely used 10 years ago, are almost completely substituted by less invasive, optimized endotracheal tube electrodes that ensure signal stability. In addition, recommendations of surgical societies for the standardized application of IONM have been established and incorporated into guidelines. However, due to the already very low frequency of (permanent) recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) paralysis following primary thyroid resections, a significant benefit of IONM compared to the \"gold standard\" of visual identification of the RLN alone has not been demonstrated so far. Moreover, the idea to enable surgeons to recognize impending nerve damage during (not after) dissection cannot be implemented with I-IONM techniques. The main benefit of I-IONM, therefore, remains the possible change of resection strategy in case of a \"loss of signal (LOS)\" after resection of one thyroid lobe in patients with planned bilateral resection. The recent introduction of continuous neuromonitoring (C-IONM) represents a significant step forward, potentially enabling the surgeon to react before irreversible damage to the RLN occurs. Preliminary data are supporting this methodological advantage. ","774":"Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) research often focuses on postoperative air leak, with special consideration for prolonged air leak. There is limited clinical data regarding how stapling devices might affect performance and postoperative outcomes, including air leak. This prospective research evaluates intraoperative and postoperative data associated with VATS, using a new surgical stapling device, in two different geographic regions (the U.S. and Europe). A total of 226 subjects across 10 institutions were enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint was occurrence and duration of postoperative air leaks, including prolonged air leak. Additional data collected included intraoperative details and postoperative outcomes. Prolonged air leak occurred in 22 subjects (10.3%) across procedures (152 lobectomies, 63 wedge resections, and 11 occurrences of wedge resection plus lobectomy). There were no significant differences in occurrence or duration of PAL between the U.S. and Europe. Regional differences were observed for intraoperative leak testing and cartridge selection relative to tissue type. Despite differences in surgical technique between continents, no major or significant difference in air leak or other clinical outcome was detected. Additional research is needed to characterize optimal cartridge selection to tissue properties and how these may potentially impact clinical outcomes.

Haemostatic agents have been used hypothesizing a beneficial effect on the prevention of lymphoceles. We aimed to review the published literature to establish whether haemostatic agents and sealants are an effective option for lymphocele prevention following urological procedure. An extensive PubMed search was performed including the following keywords: \"lymphocele\", \"lymphocele prevention\", \"fibrin glue\", \"collagen patch\", \"fibrin patch\", and \"haemostatic material\". The search, which collected data until January 2000, was restricted to the full text available articles in the English language and human studies. Our research identified 64 articles, among these only four fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 133 patients underwent surgery and were treated with haemostatic agents and\/or sealants to reduce the lymphoceles formation. The mean age was 56.1 years. A negligible variability in study design and in results and complication reporting is common. The 6.45% of patients treated with haemostatic biomaterials developed lymphocele. The rate difference of lymphoceles formation and recurrence between patient groups treated with sealant than in the controls groups is small (6.45% vs 6.88%). The evidences presented in the examined studies are only preliminary and insufficient to draw significant conclusions. A major, multicentre, randomized controlled trial is strongly needed.

Though mini laparoscopy (Mini) created new opportunities for surgical diagnosis and therapy, the limitations of early instruments inhibited widespread adoption. This is no longer the case. Mini is enjoying a renaissance, due to several factors: the maturation of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), the failure of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) platforms to achieve early expectations, and the recent significant improvements in Mini instrument functionality and durability. As a result, Mini is being increasingly applied to pediatric and adult procedures across specialties. To assess the current status of Mini laparoscopy, the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons (SLS) and the Florida Hospital Nicholson Center convened an international symposium in February 2015.

Standard Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is an established adjunctive treatment option that offers the ability to promote granulation tissue in wounds. However, there is limited evidence for its utility in the environment of active or senescent infection. Wounds that are acutely infected or that contain deleterious biofilm are a challenging problem, which require an intensive multimodal approach including antibiosis, surgical intervention, and local wound care. Adjunctive application of NPWTi can potentially expedite clearance of infection and wound closure. Although this technology has been commercially available for over a decade, its adoption has been limited. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in this therapy with emerging evidence from animal models as well as human clinical studies. There are remaining questions regarding NPWTi including the selection of the optimal instillation solution and device settings. This article discusses the past development, current knowledge, and future direction of NPWTi.","781":"","782":"Hemostasis is extremely important in neurosurgical procedures to prevent major postoperative bleedings and their catastrophic consequences. Emoxicel TAF Retilight (Bioster, a.s., Czech Republic) is a sterile, resorbable, hemostatic reticulum, mainly used to stop capillary and venous bleeding. The textile form of the hemostatic material allows, in several cases, perfect adjustment to the varied shape of the surgical cavities and of the epidural space to which it adheres when wet. Hemostatic effect is rapid, and complete hemostasis can be achieved in several minutes after application. This topical hemostatic agent is biocompatible, biodegradable, and highly resorbable. It has a hemostatic and antimicrobic effect. The main aim of this study was to verify the efficacy, broadness of use, and safety of this topical hemostatic in neurosurgical procedures. A total of 43 cases were included, 18 cranial and 25 spinal, and in only one case a postoperative epidural bleeding was reported. A histopathologic study of the hemostatic was performed. No allergic reactions were reported. Emoxicel was useful not only in stopping minor bleeding, but also for bleeding prevention in the postoperative period.

Advocates for patellar resurfacing have adopted this technique in order to avoid the potential for post-operative anterior knee pain that may be associated with the need for future reoperations. However, reports have indicated that patellar resurfacing may be associated with increased complications such as patellar implant loosening, fracture, osteonecrosis, tendon injury, wear, and instability. More recently, studies have highlighted possible patient-specific and surgical factors, such as weight, body mass index, degree of chondromalacia, and patellar alignment, which may influence functional outcomes, and thus surgical decision making. However, currently there are minimal clear guidelines to help surgeons decide whether or not to resurface the patella. Our aim was to assess the current literature and present the evidence for and against patellar resurfacing, as well as to assess factors that may aid in deciding which procedure is more suitable for the specific patient. Ultimately, we believe there is a need for further research to identify the most appropriate candidates for patellar resurfacing. ","786":"Infection after total joint arthroplasty has been most attributed to bacterial wound contamination from skin flora. To address this, the CDC recommends bathing with an antiseptic agent the night prior to the operative day. However, despite these measures, the incidence of infections has not been reduced markedly. It is important to have measures in place to ensure proper patient education about infections and disinfection protocols to optimize compliance. Our purpose was to evaluate compliance with preoperative disinfection protocols at our institution and to identify measures which may improve adherence. Between 2007 and 2011, we reviewed a database at our institution for all patients who underwent primary or revision total hip (n=2,458) and knee (n=2,293) arthroplasty. All of these patients were instructed to follow a chlorhexidine cloth disinfection protocol at the time of surgical scheduling or during their preoperative evaluation. To verify compliance, patients were instructed to remove adhesive stickers from the cloth packages at the time of disinfection and to affix them to the instruction sheet presented on the day of surgery. This was documented in the patient medical records. A database was generated to identify those patients who were compliant (n=1,035) or non-compliant (n=3,716). Following this period, if patients did not use chlorhexidine as instructed, the staff ensured one application was received pre-operatively. Approximately 78% of patients (3,716 out of 4,751 patients) were noncompliant. When evaluating the demographic between the two groups, we found that age and gender distributions were not significantly different. While preoperative decolonization protocols may reduce surgical site infections, their efficacy is limited by patient compliance and comprehension. Providing patients with thorough instructions about preoperative disinfection protocols and information about the importance of infection burden is more likely to improve patient adherence.

There is limited data on the mortality risk for open compared to closed long bone fracture. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify all patients who were admitted with a long bone fracture in the United States between 1998 and 2010. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of mortality. After adjusting for age, gender, race, insurance, and comorbidities, the HR of mortality was 2.89 (95% CI, 2.56-3.28; p&lt;0.001) for open compared to closed fracture. Stratified by anatomical site, the HR of mortality for open compared to fracture was 3.43 for femur (95% CI, 2.78-4.23; p&lt;0.001), 2.81 for tibia or fibula (95% CI, 2.17-3.64; p&lt;0.001), 2.54 for humerus (95% CI, 1.81-3.56; p&lt;0.001), and 1.56 for radius or ulna (95% CI, 1.10-2.23; p=0.014).

","789":"The routine use of highly cross-linked ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has remained controversial secondary to the possibility of decreased material properties when compared to conventional UHMWPE. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if thin, sequentially-irradiated, and annealed highly cross-linked UHMWPE tibial inserts would have improved wear properties, while maintaining mechanical integrity, compared to conventional UHMWPE during biomechanical testing under aligned and malaligned conditions. Polyethylene inserts (4.27 and 6.27 mm) manufactured from GUR 1020-UHMWPE were cyclically loaded to analyze for wear. All wear scars were visually examined after loading using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Volume loss was plotted versus cycle count with linear regression analysis yielding wear rates. There was no statistical difference in wear between both thicknesses for all testing conditions. During aligned condition testing, the volumetric wear rate for sequentially-irradiated and annealed polyethylene thicknesses of 4.27 and 6.27 mm was 4.0 and 4.4 mm3\/million cycles; and during malaligned conditions, it was 13.9 and 15.1 mm3\/million cycles. For conventional polyethylene during aligned conditions, the volumetric wear rate was 33.0 and 22.8 mm3\/million cycles; and during malaligned conditions it was 50.0 and 50.8 mm3\/million cycles. By SEM evaluation, condylar wear surfaces for conventional and sequentially-irradiated and annealed polyethylene displayed surface ripples typical of adhesive wear. There were no observed visible differences between the wear scars for conventional compared to sequentially-irradiated and annealed polyethylene with no evidence of fatigue failure. This study demonstrated no differences between polyethylenes with thicknesses of 4.27 and 6.27 mm. This strengthens the conclusion that sequentially-irradiated and annealed highly cross-linked UHMWPE can be utilized in total knee arthroplasty. The successful wear properties of 4.27 mm liners could mean that smaller tibial resections leading to bone stock preservation could be utilized in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, although further in-vivo studies are needed.","790":"Tendon injuries are an increasing problem in orthopedics as we are faced with a growing demand in sports and recreation and an aging population. Tendons have poor spontaneous regenerative capacity, and often, complete recovery after injury is not achieved. Once injured, tendons do not completely re-acquire the biological and biomechanical properties of normal tendons due to the formation of adhesions and scarring, and often these abnormalities in the arrangement and structure are risk factors for re-injury. These problems associated with the healing of tendon injuries are a challenge for clinicians and surgeons. This study examined 9 cases of subcutaneous injuries including quadriceps tendon (2 cases), patellar tendon (1 case), and Achilles tendon (6 cases), incomplete and complete, treated consecutively. The surgical technique has provided, as appropriate, the termino-terminal tenorraphy, techniques of plastics of rotation flap, reinsertion with suture anchors, and in one case tendon augmentation with cadaver tissue. In cases where we needed mechanical support to the suture, we used preloaded growth factors on porcine collagen scaffold; in cases where we needed only one biological support, we used fibrin scaffold. ","791":"The limited regenerative potential of a full thickness defect of the knee joint cartilage has certainly conditioned the development of therapeutic strategies that take into account all the aspects of the healing process. The most common treatments to repair chondral and osteochondral lesions are bone marrow stimulation, osteochondral autograft transplantation, autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. We like to emphasize the difference between a chondral and an osteochondral lesion because the difference is sometimes lost in the literature. In the context of treatment of injuries of the knee joint cartilage, the second-generation autologous chondrocyte transplant is a consolidated surgical method alternative to other techniques. Our experience with the transplantation of chondrocytes has had exceptional clinical results. We report 2 complete cases of a group of 22 in knee and ankle. These 2 cases had histological and instrumental evaluation. We cannot express conclusions, but can only make considerations, stating that, with the clinical functional result being equal, we obtained an excellent macroscopic result in both cases of second look. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a multiple surgical procedure with expensive chondrocyte culture, but even with this limitation, we think that it must be the choice in treating chondral lesions, especially in young patients. ","792":"Total knee replacement (TKR) is a successful procedure for pain relief and functional restoration in patients with advanced osteoarthritis. The number of TKRs is increasing, and this has led to an increase in revision surgeries. The key to long-term success in both primary and revision TKR is stability, as well as adequate and stable fixation between components and underlying bone. In the vast majority of primary TKRs and in some revision cases, a posterior cruciate retaining or a posterior cruciate substituting device can be used. In some primary cases with severe deformity or ligamentous instability and in most of the revision cases, a more constrained implant is required. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature concerning the use of condylar constrained knee (CCK) and rotating hinge (RH) implants in primary and revision cases focusing on the indications and results. According to this review, although excellent and very good results have been reported, there are limitations of the existing literature concerning the indications for the use of constrained implants, the absence of long-term results, and the limited comparative studies.

","795":"To assess the success of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA), scoring systems have been developed to provide a straightforward method of evaluating the outcomes of patients following surgery. Fully evaluating these outcomes is a challenging and time consuming task, and these simplistic measures often do not provide a complete picture of a patient's recovery. Therefore, we evaluated different scoring systems to determine the most effective method of assessing the outcomes of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. We evaluated all knee scoring systems currently available in literature, and a total of 46 questionnaires met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We then identified all the metrics assessed in the questionnaires (n=48) and subdivided them into objective, subjective, rehabilitative, and quality of life outcome measures. We identified the three most commonly referenced questionnaires (the Knee Society Scores, the Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcomes Scores, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Score-WOMAC) and assessed multiple permutations of these with other scoring systems to identify the combinations that would most comprehensively and efficiently evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing TKA. Of the 48 metrics, we identified four subjective, eight objective, 20 rehabilitation, and 16 quality of life metrics. On permutation of the three most referenced scoring systems, the KSS and the KOOS together yielded the greatest coverage of the above metrics (79%). When the KSS, KOOS, and WOMAC, respectively, were combined with the Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) and Short Form 36 (SF-36), they yielded 77, 73, and 60% coverage of the metrics and 35, 39, and 37% redundancy, respectively. Surgeons and researchers have attempted to fully evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing TKA. The proposed combinations may provide a more comprehensive way to cost-effectively evaluate outcomes. Further analysis is required before attempting to create newer knee scoring systems. ","796":"Complications following total hip arthroplasty (THA), such as dislocation, component loosening and wear, continue to be common indications for revision surgery. Multiple studies have attributed some of these problems to poor acetabular cup alignment and placement outside of the purported radiographic safe zone. In addition, it has been shown that conventional manually performed acetabular cup placement may not lead to optimal alignment, regardless of surgical experience. Additionally, incorrect leg length and offset can lead to dissatisfaction and instability. Therefore, robotic-arm assisted surgery has been introduced to improve accuracy of cup placement and leg length, and to offset with the aim of reducing the risk of hip instability and improving satisfaction after primary THA. Our aim was to prospectively review the use of robotic-arm assisted surgery in 224 patients and to assess whether the pre-operatively determined radiographic targets were achieved post-operatively and the proportion of acetabular cups outside of the safe zone. Pre-determined anteversion and inclination were 15 and 40 degrees, respectively. Our results have shown that the use of robotic-arm assisted surgery resulted in a post-operative mean inclination of 40 degrees (range, 34 to 51 degrees) and a mean anteversion of 16 degrees (range, 9 to 25 degrees). Ninety-nine percent of the patients remained within the pre-designated safe zone. Evidence has shown that robotic-arm assisted surgery may have improved accuracy in cup placement when compared to conventional surgery and possibly to computer-assisted surgery. When compared to the literature on robotic-arm assisted surgery, our results were comparable. We believe that this surgical technique may aid in reducing post-operative THA complications, such as aseptic loosening and dislocations, but further prospective studies are needed to evaluate clinical outcomes and long-term results.

The anatomy of the groin region will be defined as a basis for further discussion. The common pathological processes underlying groin pain such as adductor dysfunction, rectus abdominus injury, osteitis pubis, and femuro-acetabular impingement will then be reviewed and correlating radiological imaging findings presented.

","798":"Multiple scoring systems have been developed for the assessment of outcomes following total knee arthroplasty. However, few studies have comprehensively evaluated each scoring system to analyze the various outcome variables and their individual weightings toward generations of the final score. A systematic search of four electronic databases were performed from January 1960 to August, 2013 to identify studies that reported on knee scores and to sub-categorize the outcomes measured based on subjective, objective, rehabilitative, and quality of life outcomes. We also evaluated the outcome metrics that each of these systems measured to identify the relative impact of these variables toward the final score. We identified 45 different outcome metrics in 46 rating scales. Pain (80%), stiffness (13%), and swelling (13%) were the three most common subjective outcomes measured in the scoring systems, while measurements of range-of-motion (57%), flexion contracture (39%), and coronal plane deformity (35%) were the most often reported objective outcome variables. Of all the variables measured, we found that pain (mean weighted score, 26 points; range, 0 to 50 points), range-of-motion (mean weighted score, 11 points; range, 0 to 50 points), distance walked (mean weighted score, 7 points; range, 0 to 30 points), ability to climb stairs (mean weighted score, 6 points; range, 0 to 20 points), ability to rise from sitting position (mean weighted score, 4 points; range, 0 to 20 points), and presence of a flexion contracture (mean weighted score, 4 points, range, 0 to 20 points) had the greatest impact on the final score standardized to 100 points. Currently, few rating scales exist that assess all aspects of functional, rehabilitative, and quality of life outcomes including patient satisfaction within the realms of a single scoring system. Further research is needed to determine the optimal combination and weightings of the individual outcomes metrics to better evaluate overall outcomes following total knee arthroplasty and to develop a more comprehensive scoring system.

Although the AAOS and ACCP guidelines have not changed since the last review, the SCIP guidelines have focused on implementing the concepts proposed by each of these organizations. Specifically, the use of aspirin has been highlighted as an acceptable chemoprophylactic agent. Warfarin and low molecular weight heparin remain widely used, but maintaining therapeutic levels of warfarin remains a challenge, and LWMH has not shown itself to be superior to any of the other chemoprophylactic agents. The newer oral anticoagulants, such as factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors, may have superior efficacy, but their safety profile must be studied further.

Incisions have also become much smaller over the years, such as those seen in total port access lobectomy or microlobectomy. A modified version of the uniportal VATS lobectomy through the subxiphoid incision has also recently been used.

AAAs are characterized by a 50% increase in the diameter of the aneurysmal aorta compared with the normal vessel. Degeneration of structural components of the aortic wall is believed to be central in the pathogenesis of AAAs. The exact mechanism of degeneration is not well characterized, although degradation of elastin and collagen has been clearly shown. At least six genetic variants have been associated with AAA in genome-wide association studies: CDKN2BAS1, DAB2IP, LDLR, LRP1, SORT1, and IL6R. These variants reach genome-wide significance; however, they have not been replicated in multiple cohorts, nor have they been clearly shown to be disease causative. AAA is a challenging disease for investigation because it is most often asymptomatic and generally has a late disease onset, making it difficult to diagnose.

We compared data from a medication trial to pooled data of high-energy transurethral microwave therapy (HE-TUMT) to evaluate differences in outcomes and costs between the modalities. Covariate-adjusted comparison of treatments from independent clinical trials. Data from Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study arms were compared to Urologix pooled data from seven HE-TUMT studies at 25 centers. Improvements in voiding symptoms and quality of life (QoL) were determined and a repeated measure logistic regression analysis to control for baseline covariates was performed. Cost data were collected using published outcomes, Medicare 2013 national averages, and discount online pharmacy prices. HE-TUMT provided significant improvement in voiding symptoms and QoL compared to all MTOPS arms through two years. At four years, all therapies maintain similar improvements when adjusting for baseline covariates. Four year cumulative costs of HE-TUMT ($3,620) were less than combination medical therapy ($7,200). HE-TUMT provides better improvement of LUTS compared to medication for two years. At four years, all therapies provide comparable improvement but HE-TUMT is less expensive with better QoL.

We hypothesize that there is a correlation between body mass index and presacral thickness. Computed Tomography (CT) images of 241 patients were reviewed in this retrospective study. The presacral thickness was measured by taking the cross sectional distance from the sacral promontory to the upper aspect of the iliac arteries. The corresponding demographic information of age, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities were evaluated using univariate analysis, linear regression, and multiple regression analysis. The mean age was 56.6 years, and BMI was 27.6. The mean presacral thickness measurement based on the CT scan was 21.08 mm. Univariate linear regression models demonstrated a positive correlation between presacral thickness and BMI and a negative correlation with age.

The correlation between investigators and methods were estimated by calculating the Fleiss Kappa values. Twenty-four patients were assessed. For the clinical examination, the Kappa was 0.81. For computed tomography with the patient in the supine position, the Kappa was 0.94 and in the prone position it was 0.89. The Kappa for clinical examination and computed tomography combined was 0.80. At clinical examination, incisional hernia can be defined as any detectable defect in the abdominal wall with intra-abdominal contents protruding beyond the aponeurosis. The same definition can be used at computed tomography with the addition that any visible hernia sac is also regarded an incisional hernia. With this definition, there is very good agreement between investigators at clinical investigation and at computed tomography in the prone or in the supine position. The highest agreement among investigators is achieved with computed tomography in the supine position.

A review of the preoperative imaging by computed tomography confirmed a round ligament connected to the right portal umbilical portion. It also established that the gallbladder was located to the left of the round ligament, and attached to the left lateral segment of the liver. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed successfully in this patient with the usual port site and careful dissection with a normograde approach. The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day with an uneventful course. Prior identification of a left-sided gallbladder is possible with cautious attention.

","819":"For a long time, obesity has been known as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is one of the main causes of death in developed countries. This risk is due to the coexistence of other factors associated with obesity, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and abnormalities in glycemic metabolism. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and it is not surprising that the global prevalence of this disease continues to increase. Surgical intervention is now the most effective modality to treat severe obesity and its comorbidities. However, endoluminal interventions performed entirely through the gastrointestinal tract by using endoscopic devices offer the potential for an outpatient weight loss procedure that may be safer, less invasive, and more cost-effective, compared with current surgical approaches. Given the emerging role of endoscopic procedures in the treatment of obesity and rapid changes in endoscopic technologies and techniques, this review considers the current state of endoscopic management of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Endoscopic techniques attempt to mimic some of the anatomic features of bariatric surgery and rely on gastric restriction and duodenal exclusion. The endoscopic placement of the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner in morbidly obese patients induces significant weight loss. Additionally, early studies reported significant improvements in several parameters of glucose homeostasis in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes. In this article we will review the available results obtained with the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner. ","820":"One of the most important trends in intraoperative neural monitoring (IONM) in thyroid surgery is currently the real-time monitoring of the vagus nerve (VN) in order to prevent recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) iatrogenic damages. Notably, continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring (C-IONM) seems to be superior to intermitted intraoperative neural monitoring (I-IONM) because it enhances standardization by permanent vagus nerve (VN) stimulation, and it provides entire and constant RLN function monitoring as the surgeon dissects and removes the thyroid gland. It also has to be highlighted that the surgical maneuvers for the automatic periodic stimulating (APS) placement must be accurate and standardized in order to avoid a potential iatrogenic morbidity on the VN function. We recommend the experienced surgeon be very careful in each step, with cautious dissection. With this review article we provide a comprehensive analyses of C-IONM technique with the APS accessory for conventional and endoscopic thyroid surgery.

Bariatric surgery has proven to be the most effective treatment modality for obesity in the long term. However, current surgical procedures are accompanied by a substantial risk of complications. Several endoluminal techniques have been developed to achieve weight loss in obese patients and claim to be as effective as surgery but safer. The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic bariatric procedures that provide structural changes in anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal tract. A comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and the references of the selected articles. All studies included in this review show excess weight loss in the short-term to medium-term, which ranges from 24% to 58%. Seven serious adverse events were reported. Therefore, we conclude that endoscopic bariatric procedures providing structural changes show relatively low complication rates and promising short-term weight loss and effect on obesity-related comorbidities. Long-term results in large study populations are necessary before these techniques can be incorporated in the standard treatment of obesity.

The authors performed an in vivo, preclinical study on eschar-covered porcine wounds. Two clinical case studies are also included. Test products, GV\/MB antibacterial foam dressing, collagenase ointment, collagenase ointment plus GV\/MB antibacterial foam dressing, medical-grade honey, and moist gauze dressing (control), were applied to porcine wounds using a split-back study design. The percent of eschar removal and wound closure were measured and recorded at time points up to 14 days. Statistically significant reduction in eschar was observed with GV\/MB dressing and with GV\/MB dressing with collagenase. By day 14, the wounds with GV\/MB dressing alone and GV\/MB dressing with collagenase had eschar covering less than 25% of the wound bed area compared with collagenase alone, medical grade honey, or moist gauze control, which showed eschar still covering over 75% of the wound bed area. Autolytic debridement activity of GV\/MB foam dressings was evident in the porcine eschar study, as well as in the cases described. ","825":"Pilonidal disease (PD) is a chronic and debilitating condition. The overall aim of the scoping review is to map and summarize a wide range of evidence to examine which topical agent or dressing is effective in promoting pilonidal wound healing by secondary intention. Review of this cumulative body of evidence will inform care and guide dressing selection for PD related wounds and delineate future research priorities based on identified knowledge gaps and clinical practice issues. Overall, there is some evidence to suggest that topical applications of hydrogel, silver, honey, zinc, selected foam materials, negative pressure wound therapy, platelet rich plasma, and plant extracts may promote wound healing. Topical treatment using polyhexamethylene biguanide and silver may be beneficial in reducing bacterial burden. Finally, silver, honey, and hydrocolloid dressings may help alleviate wound related pain. However, evidence remains insufficient in light of methodological limitations and biases of the studies. ","826":"Currently, there is a tendency to perform surgical procedures via laparoscopic or thoracoscopic access. However, even with the impressive technological advancement in surgical materials, such as improvement in quality of monitors, light sources, and optical fibers, surgeons have to face simple problems that can greatly hinder surgery by video. One is the formation of \"fog\" or residue buildup on the lens, causing decreased visibility. Intracavitary techniques for cleaning surgical optics and preventing fog formation have been described; however, some of these techniques employ the use of expensive and complex devices designed solely for this purpose. Moreover, these techniques allow the cleaning of surgical optics when they becomes dirty, which does not prevent the accumulation of residue in the optics. To solve this problem we have designed a device that allows cleaning the optics with no surgical stops and prevents the fogging and residue accumulation. The objective of this study is to evaluate through experimental testing the effectiveness of a simple device that prevents the accumulation of residue and fogging of optics used in surgical procedures performed through thoracoscopic or laparoscopic access. Ex-vivo experiments were performed simulating the conditions of residue presence in surgical optics during a video surgery. The experiment consists in immersing the optics and catheter set connected to the IV line with crystalloid solution in three types of materials: blood, blood plus fat solution, and 200 mL of distilled water and 1 vial of methylene blue. The optics coupled to the device were immersed in 200 mL of each type of residue, repeating each immersion 10 times for each distinct residue for both thirty and zero degrees optics, totaling 420 experiments. A success rate of 98.1% was observed after the experiments, in these cases the device was able to clean and prevent the residue accumulation in the optics. ","827":"Gastroschisis (GS) is a structural defect of the anterior abdominal wall, usually diagnosed antenatally, that occurs with a frequency of approximately 4 per 10,000 pregnancies. Babies born with GS require neonatal intensive care and surgical management of the abdominal wall defect soon after birth. Although contemporary survival rates for GS are over 90%, these babies are at risk for significant morbidity, and require 4 to 6 weeks of costly, resource-intensive care in specialized neonatal units. Much consideration has been given to how best to treat the abdominal wall defect of GS. The traditional approach, necessitated by a need to establish enteral feeding as quickly as possible, consists of early postnatal visceral reduction and sutured abdominal closure. Advances in neonatal nutritional support have enabled the development of surgical approaches, which permit gradual visceral reduction and delayed abdominal closure. In cases where early visceral reduction cannot be achieved, delayed closure enabled by the initial placement of a prosthetic silo has been a live-saving alternative. The development of preformed silos has simplified their use and led to an interest in treating all cases with a delayed closure philosophy. Most recently, a sutureless technique of abdominal closure has been reported, which has the benefit of avoiding general anesthesia and offers other outcome improvements over sutured closure of the defect. The debate over primary closure versus silo placement and delayed closure continues to receive much attention. The goal of this article is to review historical aspects of gastroschisis closure, and then focus on current surgical techniques, including the innovative sutureless closure, with an analysis of the comparative clinical effectiveness of these approaches to treatment of the abdominal wall defect in GS.","828":"Medical treatment of patients always entails the risk of undesired complications or side effects. This is particularly poignant in surgery as both the disease to be treated and the surgical intervention to be performed can be life threatening. Hence, it is essential to inform a surgical patient in detail about the expectations desired, but also the possible undesired outcomes and complications, especially when new surgical techniques are introduced. Apart from communication about available evidence regarding treatment options, the patient's preference needs to be invoked to make sure the surgeon's advice matches the patient's preference. Shared decision-making (SDM) invokes the bidirectional communication between physicians and patients required to involve the patient's preference in the eventual treatment choice. SDM is considered as an essential part of evidence-based medicine as it helps determine whether the available evidence on the possible benefits and harms of treatment options match the patient's characteristics and preferences. This paper will exemplify what SDM is, why it is important, and how it can be performed in surgical practice. Several tools to facilitate SDM are presented. ","829":"We know that experienced endoscopic surgeons, despite having extensive training, may make a rare but fatal mistake. Prof. Takeshi Ohdaira developed a device visualizing brain action potential to reflect the latent psychological instability of the surgeon. The Ohdaira system consists of three components: a real-time brain action potential measurement unit, a simulated abdominal cavity, and an intra-abdominal monitor. We conducted two psychological stress tests by using an artificial laparoscopic simulator and an animal model. There were five male subjects aged between 41 to 61 years. The psychological instability scores were considered to reflect, to some extent, the number of years of experience of the surgeon in medical care. However, very high inter-individual variability was noted. Furthermore, we discovered the following: 1) bleeding during simulated laparoscopic surgery--an episode generally considered to be psychological stress for the surgeon--did not form the greatest psychological stress; 2) the greatest psychological stress was elicited at the moment when the surgeon became faced with a setting in which his anatomical knowledge was lacking or a setting in which he presumed imminent bleeding; and 3) the excessively activated action potential of the brain possibly leads to a procedural error during surgery. A modified brain action potential measurement unit can reveal the latent psychological instability of surgeons that possibly leads to errors in surgical procedures.","830":"This article describes the basic technology and technique behind modified virtual colonoscopy (MVC).

It is difficult to manage, and there are no commonly accepted guidelines. While most acute bone infections are usually successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics, chronic infections and infections in the presence of foreign materials usually require operative treatment with debridement, removal of metals, intravenous antibiotics, and very often local antibiotics. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the existing literature concerning the use of bone grafts as carriers for local antibiotic delivery for the treatment and prevention of bone infections. According to the literature, antibiotic-loaded autologous bone grafts for the treatment of infected tibial nonunion is a good option (Grade-B recommendations). Although there are several studies concerning the use of antibiotic-loaded allogenic bone grafts in infected joint arthroplasty revisions, there is a lack of comparative studies (Grade-C recommendations).

Considerable progress has been made in its treatment and prevention; however, poor outcomes, especially with regard to limb loss, warrant further development of treatment options. This article will examine new advances being made in the area of limb salvage for this morbid disease. Open surgical techniques and materials such as distal vein patches and heparin-bonded PTFE will be discussed. Additionally, new developments in endovascular therapies with particular regard to infrapopliteal interventions and drug-eluting stents will be reviewed. Beyond the simple techniques and materials, there is a growing movement in the world of vascular surgery to examine surgical and endovascular interventions with regard to angiosome-oriented revascularization of ulceration and gangrene. This paradigm has the potential to change prioritization and planning of both types of therapies as further research into this concept develops.

Patients with benign disease requiring a hysterectomy are no longer subjected to living with a large incisional scar that was common only 20 years ago. With the advent of minimally invasive surgery, surgeons can now provide hysterectomy patients with cosmetically pleasing results. To better understand the impact of surgical scars from hysterectomy incisions, 200 subjects answered a surgical incision questionnaire. Cosmetic issues (i.e., hysterectomy scars) were self-reported as important in 93% of subjects, of which 24% indicated this was extremely important. Of these same subjects, 11% indicated they were extremely bothered about their current scars. Subject interest in surgery without scars was 92% and 45% noted extreme interest. Concern about the surgical incision appearance was cited by 85% of subjects. Familiarity about incisions associated with the different hysterectomy procedures resulted in 26% of subjects who were not at all familiar. Low placed incision locations were considered cosmetically superior by 86% of the subjects. The least desirable incision location was above the belly button (69%) whereas the most desirable incision location was below the bikini line (68%). Discussion about the location, number, and incision size prior to surgery was cited to be important by 93% of subjects. Study subjects show there is value in discussing the number and placement of surgical incisions prior to surgery. Cosmesis of the surgical scars is a concern for many women, but most subjects knew little about the hysterectomy incision options. Based on these findings, surgeons can improve patient satisfaction scores by discussing incisional placement and surgical options prior to the procedure. ","836":"The article reports the incidence of multiple inguinal protrusions in the same groin in a patient collect who underwent open hernia repair. Multiple ipsilateral inguinal hernias compose an almost neglected topic that, if not identified during hernia repair, could lead to unclear discomfort, pain, and reoperation. A collect of 100 consecutive open anterior inguinal hernia procedures was analyzed. The patients were divided into two subsets-A: patients with a single protrusion and B: patients with more than one protrusion simultaneously arising from the inguinal floor. The single hernias from cohort A and the multiple hernias from cohort B were further categorized using the Nyhus classification system. Eighty-eight single unilateral hernias were detected and 12 multiple inguinal hernias were ipsilaterally arising from the same groin. Nine percent of the multiple protrusions were double (three double indirect and six in combination direct + indirect). Three patients (3%) presented with triple protrusions; of those two individuals, one had a combination of double indirect, one had a direct hernia, and the third patient showed a tricomponent protrusion (hernia of the fossa supravescicalis + hernia of the fossa inguinalis media + indirect hernia). These numbers demonstrate that multiple ipsilateral inguinal hernias are more frequent than imagined. If undiscovered during a herniorrhaphy, the \"forgotten\" protrusion may generate unclear groin pain requiring reoperation. Consequently, is to envisage that many re-interventions will likely involve false \"recurrences.\" Therefore, during hernia repair, more attention and adhesiolysis is essential during inspection of the inguinal floor. In fact, a careful exposure of the anatomical structures of the groin could be very advantageous in properly managing such conditions. This kind of surgical approach can help to prevent patient's discomfort and re-interventions.","837":"Autologous fat transfer (AFT) for increased tissue bulk has been reported on since the 1990s, and has increased by 26.6% from 2009 to 2010. Despite this increase, there is relatively little published data. While the described method of AFT to muscle tissue has advantages of being matched to the patient and retaining all the properties of tissue, challenges arise due to the size of muscles, the ability to measure immediate and long term placement and retention, and frequency of aberrant anatomy in order to avoid vasculature and potential complications; reportedly 10% to 27%. We present the results of a study using ultrasound visualization to assist in AFT to the biceps and triceps. Ten male subjects were treated with AFT to the biceps and triceps under intraoperative ultrasonic visualization. Pre- and post-operative circumferential measurements were collected as well as follow-up at weeks six and 12. A mean of 90 cc and 110 cc were injected subfascially into the biceps and triceps, respectively, of 10 study subjects. Post-operative circumferential measurements increased by a mean of 3.0 cm and follow-up measurements were found to have increased by a mean of 3.3 cm over baseline. No compartment syndrome, fat emboli or significant pain were experienced by any subject in this study. Autologous fat transfer to smaller muscle areas such as the bicep and tricep is both feasible and safe with consistent and durable results. The addition of pre-operative ultrasound imaging provides a means to safely avoid critical structures such as vasculature; and intra-operative ultrasound allows the surgeon to directly visualize the relevant anatomy as each injection is performed confirming intramuscular placement. ","838":"Spinous process fixation (SPF) has gained attention as a less invasive option for lumbar fusion surgery. Minimally invasive techniques are of interest in an elderly population due to decreased surgical time and post-operative complications. Clinical outcomes and fusion rates have not been determined in a large cohort. Our objective was to describe significant predictors of visual analog scale (VAS), length of stay, blood loss, fusion rates, and complication rates for patients treated for degenerative lumbar spondolysis with ISP fixation with and without supplemental instrumentation. Charts were assessed for post-operative VAS vs. pre-operative VAS at: 1-3, &gt;3-6, and &gt;6-12 months. To control confounding variables, VAS scores were modeled as a repeated-measures linear-mixed-model. In a sub-cohort CT images were assessed for interspinous and interbody (IB) fusion. The images were reviewed by an independent radiologist to evaluate fusion status. Eighty-six SPF patients (91 levels, mean age 67 years) were identified. After determining the model, age and sex remained predictors of VAS. Adjusting for age and sex, patients saw a decrease of 3.6 VAS points from baseline to three months (95% CI: 2.9-4.4, p&lt;0.0001) that was maintained over the six to 12 month follow-up period. A sub-cohort of 50 patients with CT scans were identified and assessed for ISP and IB fusion at a mean of 181 days postoperatively. Ninety-four percent of levels demonstrated ISP fusion. Sixty-one percent of solid ISP fusion patients also had an interbody cage, but this did not impact fusion rates. Eighty-six percent of these levels showed solid IB fusion (BSF-3). Of the four pseudoarthrosed levels, two had pedicle screw fixation, and two were IB and ISP fixation. Only two patients went on to re-exploration and explantation due to pain secondary to spinous process and\/or lamina fracture. This elderly cohort treated with SPF demonstrated significant improvement in VAS with reliable fusion rates. ","839":"The long-term outcomes of undersizing annuloplasty for the treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is affected by the progressive dilation of the annulus, which carries increased risk for ring disinsertion. Reasons underlying this phenomenon might be found in the excess of physical stress on the annuloplasty sutures during the ventricular remodeling process. We report a technique based on the placement of a double row of overlapping sutures aiming at reducing the potential for ring disinsertion. Eleven patients with IMR undergoing mitral valve repair associated with coronary bypass grafting were treated with this technique and echocardiographically followed up at 6 and 12 months. The overall annular dimension decreased significantly with a significant reduction of the tenting area and no recurrence of mitral regurgitation at 1 year. A double row of overlapping sutures allowed firm attachment of the prosthetic ring while downsizing the annulus in IMR, limiting the consequences of changes in subannular ventricular geometry. This technique might therefore be considered a useful aid during mitral valve repair. ","840":null,"841":"Multiple gestations are on the rise with the advent of artificial reproductive technologies.

It is well known that vaginal prolapse may lead to sexual dysfunction and in many studies repair of prolapse improves this dysfunction. During the progression of prolapse, sexual dysfunction or decreased vaginal sensation due to vaginal wall laxity may be one of the early symptoms that women suffer prior to the prolapse itself becoming symptomatic. Surgical repair or reconstruction of this type of vaginal defect may be indicated if repair will improve symptoms of sexual dysfunction caused by vaginal wall laxity. In this review, we will examine the existing data and make conclusions regarding vaginal rejuvenation and its impact on female sexual function.

However, traditional autografts have several disadvantages, including the need for a surgical procedure with anesthesia, creation of a second wound at the donor site, difficulty in obtaining uniform graft thickness, scarring, and pain. Epidermal skin grafts offer an alternative to split- and full-thickness skin grafts in that only the epidermal skin layer is removed at the donor site, resulting in minimal to no bleeding, minimal scarring and donor site pain, improved cosmetic outcome, and no need for anesthesia. Although epidermal grafts have been successfully used for many decades in treating pigmentation disorders, its expanded use for wounds has been limited largely due to lack of a reliable method of harvesting patient epidermal skin. We present our experience using a new automated, epidermal harvesting system to harvest epidermal grafts in patients with multiple comorbidities; an overview of the history and mechanisms of epidermal grafting is included to help inform clinical practice. The epidermal harvesting system applies heat and suction concurrently to normal skin to induce epidermal microdome formation within 30 to 45 minutes, and harvested epidermal grafts are transferred to recipient sites via a film dressing. In this patient series, donor sites healed completely without scarring within one to two weeks. Complete re-epithelialization occurred in three of four wounds, and 50% re-epithelialization occurred in one wound. New technology in epidermal grafting offers a simple, relatively quick, low-risk option that can be performed by a non-surgically trained clinician in an outpatient setting.

The categories of surgical treatment include restrictive, malabsorptive, and combination operations. Two of the restrictive operations at the forefront of today's treatments are laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic gastric greater curvature plication (LGCP). A literature review has been completed to compare the current technique and results for LSG and LGCP. LSG is a restrictive technique in which reduced gastric volume is achieved by partial greater curvature resection. The benefits of LSG include ease of operation, sustainable weight loss, and low complication rate. The disadvantages include risk for severe complications such as gastric leak and bleeding. LGCP is a novel restrictive technique which reduces gastric volume by plication of the greater curvature; it is still in the investigational stages for use in the United States. A gastric tube is formed with the plication, but no portion of the stomach is excised. The benefits of LGCP include low cost, low risk of complication, such as gastric perforation and bleeding, as well as adequate short term weight loss. The disadvantages include higher risk of nausea and vomiting post-op, a non-zero risk of perforation and bleeding, and likely an unsustainable weight loss. In comparison, LGCP is considered feasible and safe in the short term and especially suited for institutions requiring lower-cost procedures. However, LGCP weight loss may be unsustainable compared to LSG. While LSG complication rates are slightly higher, LGCP is an inferior restrictive procedure for weight loss. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long term outcomes for procedural comparison.

There is a toolbox of topical antimicrobial wound dressings that incorporate silver, iodine, polyhexamethylene biguanide, methylene blue\/gentian violet, and honey. This article reviews a diverse range of evidence to discuss the advantages and disadvantage of topical antimicrobial dressings. Discussion will provide guidance on when and how to use topical antimicrobial dressings to achieve optimal outcomes and cost-effective wound care. Chronic wounds do not follow a predictable and expected healing trajectory, and they may persist for months or years due to underlying disease processes, recurrent injury, and comorbidities.1 With an aging population and increased prevalence of chronic diseases, the majority of wounds are refractory to healing, placing a significant burden on the health system and individual patients. Bacterial burden and biofilm have been recognized as key factors contributing to persistent inflammation, tissue destruction, delayed wound healing, and other serious complications (especially in individuals who are frail and immune-compromised).2 It has been demonstrated that when bacterial growth reaches a critical threshold of 105 bacteria per gram of tissue, bacterial toxins can cause tissue damage in the superficial wound compartment, delaying healing.2 In the literature, this phenomenon is referred to as critical colonization, increased bacterial burden, superficial infection, or localized infection. According to a recent review, over 50% of chronic wounds exhibit signs and symptoms that are consistent with localized infection.3. ","850":"Topical hemostatic agents that can seal tissues and assist in the coagulation cascade of patients undergoing surgery have been readily available for several decades. Using either synthetic or animal\/plant-derived materials, these agents represent a powerful tool to reduce postoperative bleeding complications in cases where mechanical or energy-driven hemostasis is not possible or insufficient. Recently, a novel sealing hemostatic patch, HEMOPATCH (Baxter International, Deerfield, IL), was developed. The device is a thin and flexible patch consisting of a specifically-formulated porous collagen matrix, coated on one side with a thin protein-binding layer. This gives the patch a dual mechanism of action, in which the two components interact to achieve hemostasis by sealing off the bleeding surface and initiating the body's own clotting mechanisms. Here we present a series of case reports that outline the quick, effective hemostatic sealing of HEMOPATCH in a variety of clinical applications, including solid organ, gastrointestinal, biliopancreatic, endocrine, cardiovascular, and urologic surgeries. Essentially a feasibility study, these reports demonstrate how HEMOPATCH can be applied to seal almost any bleeding surface encountered during a range of procedures. Our results show that the device is eminently capable in both via laparotomy and laparoscopic approaches, and in patients with impaired coagulation or highly variable anatomies. In conclusion, our cases document the ease-of-use, application, and immediate hemostatic effect of the patch across a broad range of surgical settings and paves the way for future randomized clinical trials with more extensive follow-up.

Conventional manual cement removal by hand or power-driven instruments can be time-consuming, can require osteotomy, and can be associated with complications such as cortical perforation, fracture, or bone loss. Ultrasonic devices offer an alternative method of cement removal, but the potential for thermal injury exists, in particular for the humerus and the radial nerve. Considering these problems with the use of ultrasound, and whereas the old cement mantle may be left in place in the hip or knee but not in the shoulder, we tried this new mechanical cement extractor also in the humerus. We utilized this extractor in 5 cases, and we eliminated all residual resin in an accurate and complete way without bone loss and without iatrogenic fractures in all cases.

","854":"Sexual function after hysterectomy and myomectomy is a controversial topic and influenced by several factors. With regard to hysterectomy, there is not a consensus whether the removal of the cervix will modify sexual function after surgery, and patients who choose to preserve their cervix should be counseled about the possibility of continued vaginal bleeding and the need for continued pap smear surveillance after surgery. In most studies, hysterectomy has been found to improve sexual function because usually patients have symptoms that indicated the surgery, such as abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pain, and as these symptoms cease, they report an improvement in their sexual life. In regards to myomectomy, literature is scarce, however few studies have shown an improvement in sexual function due to the same reasons as hysterectomy. For purposes of research, it is important to standardize sexual questionnaires when performing studies about this outcome. It is also important to emphasize that during discussion of your patient, sexual outcomes should be addressed and that the surgeon should consider all patients' personal, religious, and cultural background during the decision-making process because it will minimize patient's disappointment if she develops a negative response after surgery.

","866":"Cryopreserved amnion tissues derived from amniotic membrane\/umbilical cord (AM\/UC) have been used extensively in ophthalmology for minimizing postoperative inflammation, pain, and adhesion formation following various surgical procedures. There is limited data in the current literature regarding the use of amnion tissue product in foot and ankle surgery. The purpose of this retrospective study is to report the short-term safety profile after in vivo application of cryopreserved AM\/UC tissue use in foot and ankle surgery. A retrospective consecutive case series was performed for cases where amnion tissue was used with a minimum follow-up of 120 days between 2011 and 2012. The clinical outcomes of interest were postoperative infections, delayed or nonhealing wounds, adverse surgical site reactions, and repeat surgery for formal irrigation and debridement. One hundred twenty-four patients qualified for inclusion. Cryopreserved AM\/UC tissue was introduced into the surgical wound and placed adjacent to the compromised and repaired tendons, most frequently in peroneal and Achilles tendon repairs. In this level IV consecutive case series cohort, there was an overall wound complication rate of 5.64%, with a re-operation rate of 1.6% (2\/124). In each of these cases, patients had an irrigation and debridement with ultimate successful wound healing. The results of this study demonstrate that the use of amnion tissue in the foot and ankle setting is safe with a decreasing trend in overall complication rates compared with historically published norms. ","867":"The primary aim of this study was to compare preoperative assessments with postoperative outcomes from patients undergoing foot and ankle revisions and\/or complex reconstructions with tendon and\/or nerve involvement using cryopreserved human amniotic membrane and umbilical cord (cHAM\/UC). We hypothesized complex foot and ankle surgery using amniotic membrane would be an effective treatment leading to reduced pain and improved functional outcomes. Fourteen patients (6 male and 8 female) underwent open foot and ankle surgery during the study period. All 14 patients included in this cohort reported improvement, namely, lessened pain intensity both on the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale and the pain numeric rating scale (NRS), as well as improved functional status. The mean AOFAS score improved from 50 (range, 17-79) preoperatively to 85 (range, 67-100) postoperatively. The mean NRS score also improved from 8 (range, 4-10) preoperatively to 2 (range, 0-6) postoperatively with a mean percent change in pain NRS of 78% (range 17-100%). Both outcome-scoring systems showed statistically significant differences (p &lt; .0001) when we compared the preoperative and postoperative results. All patients included in the cohort showed improvement in both outcome measures. Further study of long-term endpoints is warranted. ","868":"Although synthetic mesh has dramatically reduced recurrence in elective hernia repair, its use in contaminated surgical fields has been traditionally associated with complications such as wound sepsis, enterocutaneous fistulas, and chronic prosthetic infection. Biologic meshes emerged in the late 1990s with a rapid popularity fueled largely by the demand for an appropriate substitute in lieu of synthetic mesh in these complex cases; however, the high cost and rate of hernia recurrence have tempered the initial enthusiasm. Biosynthetic meshes were developed as a possible cost-effective alternative to both synthetic and tissue-derived products. Using biodegradable polymers instead of animal or cadaver tissue, they provide a temporary scaffold for deposition of proteins and cells necessary for tissue ingrowth, neovascularization, and host integration. Herein we review the current status of biosynthetic meshes for hernia repair.

Treatment of mild cases of hallux rigidus focuses on conservative, nonsurgical treatments such as rigid orthotic devices, physical therapy, pain relievers, and corticosteroid injections. Hallux rigidus recalcitrant to conservative management can be treated with dorsal cheilectomy to palliate pain at extremes of motion. Post-cheilectomy scarring and stiffness of the joint result in a diminished arc of motion over time. This clinical problem is not readily addressed by current treatment methods. Amniotic membrane\/umbilical cord has the potential to modulate adult wound healing by suppressing stromal cellular-based inflammation and reducing scarring. Cryopreserved amniotic membrane\/umbilical cord (AM\/UC) tissue has been successfully used for minimizing postoperative inflammation, pain, and adhesion formation following various soft tissue reconstructive procedures, particularly in ophthalmology. Recently, the therapeutic potential of cryopreserved AM\/UC has been expanded for use in lower extremity reconstructive procedures, specifically where wound healing and adhesion prevention are of clinical significance. This article reviews a bilateral case report experience of the novel utility of cryopreserved AM\/UC tissue as an adhesion barrier and inflammatory modulator in conjunction with dorsal cheilectomy for treatment of hallux rigidus.

This study demonstrates the feasibility of the van Velthoven anastomosis method in swine model using a novel telesurgical system with haptic sensation: the Telelap Alf-X. Twenty vesicourethral anastomoses were performed using the system in female swine with two working ports and a camera. With two 2.0 Vicryl, a single knot vesicourethral anastomosis was performed as described by van Velthoven with Telelap Alf-X. The time of each operation was recorded, water tightness and tension were examined at the end of the procedure by irrigation through a 12 Fr catheter. The 1:1 haptic sensation, improved ergonomy, the open architecture of the robotic system, and articulated handles contributed to the easiness of performance and short learning curve, as the time of the procedure decreased by 50% after the first 5 cases. All the anastomoses were functional and proved to be successful and watertight. No leakage occurred. The novel features of the Telelap Alf-X contribute to its ease of use and make the telesurgical performance of vesicourethral anastomosis similar to open surgery, without the disadvantages of the latter. ","875":"The development of three-dimensional (3D) knee models and analytical tools from large databases of computerized tomographic data linked to patient demographics has led to the development of a fuller understanding of the amount of variation in the anatomy and morphology of the human knee and how this relates to clinical applications. In this study, we have aimed to review the spectrum of clinical applications of three-dimensional modeling, which includes osteotomies and knee arthroplasties. More specifically, three-dimensional modeling has been used for: the assessment of tibial and femoral morphometry, the potential development of novel instrumentation for femoral resection, the evaluation of femoral condylar anthropometry, correlating mechanical and anatomical alignment, the assessment of the relationship of joint line and flexion, the extension and mechanical axis of the knee, and the evaluation of the relationship between medial tibial tubercle to the posterior aspect of the tibia. Three-dimensional modeling and analytical technology may provide insights into anthropometric variations in the knee and may assist in the future development of more patient specific instrumentation, implant positioning, and implant designs. It is hoped that such advances could improve patient satisfaction and long-term implant survivorship.

Various guidelines have been proposed for VTED prevention, the most prevalent being the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). Although there were disagreements in the previous guidelines, there has recently been concordance with the two organizations. Additionally, there are various new pharmacological agents and mechanical devices being utilized and developed for VTED prevention. Therefore, in this review we aim to: (1) evaluate the current ACCP and AAOS guidelines, (2) discuss new chemoprophylactic agents currently available, (3) report briefly on mechanical compression devices to prevent VTED in patients undergoing lower extremity total joint arthroplasty.

Unfortunately, the current cryopreservation method promotes a degenerative process leading to progressive homograft fibrosis and calcification. Valve durability of fresh allografts appears to be superior to cryopreserved grafts. The main indications of aortic valve replacement with a homograft are endocarditis, rheumatic disease, bicuspid and dystrophic aortopathies. Our experience with 210 aortic homografts implanted over a 10-year period is reported. We describe the different implantation techniques with particular emphasis on the current technique of choice, namely homograft root replacement. Approximately one-fourth of all aortic homografts will experience structural valve deterioration at 12 years. Structural homograft valve deterioration translates predominately into valve insufficiency and less frequently into stenosis. Young recipient age it appears is the major determinant of reoperation. Predictors of early and late mortality are discussed.

This is a retrospective chart review. POP-Q measurements preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively were evaluated using non-parametric statistical analysis. The primary outcome was to compare postoperative POPQ measurements at 12 months following surgery. Secondary outcomes were age at the time of surgery, mesh erosion rate, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and baseline anatomical support. A total of 71 patients were identified: 44 patients had a BMI below 30, and 27 had a BMI equal to or greater than 30. We found no significant relationship between BMI and anatomical support at 12 months post operation. However, obese patients were younger at the time of prolapse surgery (53.6 versus 60.6 years of age, p=0.0022). In regards to the ICS prolapse stage, no difference was found between obese and non-obese patients (2.81 versus 2.95, p=0.17). ","881":"Bladder dysfunctions have been treated for decades through medical treatments or surgical procedures, especially in the context of prolapse conditions and stress incontinence. Over the last decade, sacral nerve modulation (SNM) has been introduced as a further option in the treatment of some urinary and fecal symptoms. Current techniques of percutaneous implantation are limited to superficial extrapelvic nerves that expose patients to lead migration and dislocation or infections, complications that cannot be ignored. Access to endopelvic nerves and plexuses will be mandatory in the future, especially to the sacral plexus area that is the crossroads of all vesical-sphincteric, anorectal, and sexual functions. The endopelvic location of electrodes protects against the above mentioned complications. Some open-surgical approaches have been described in the past, but all of them were extremely laborious and dangerous. All these limitations were overcome with the introduction of laparoscopy into the field of pelvic oncology. Laparoscopic retroperitoneal surgery and the development of video-endoscopy and appropriate instruments allows for access and visibility to all pelvic nerves and plexuses as well as laparoscopic pelvic neurosurgical procedures. One of these methods is the implantation of neuroprothesis-a technique called the \"LION procedure\"-which permits selective electrical stimulation of pelvic nerves and plexuses. One very interesting site of implantation for treatment of urinary and faecal symptoms is the pudendal nerve (PN). Stimulation of this nerve induces two different actions: a strong contraction of the sphincters-treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence and an inhibitory effect on the bladder-and treatment for bladder overactivity.

As a primary goal the ideal fixation method should contribute to preventing recurrences. It should also be associated with less pain, and should prevent adhesion formation, mesh migration, and shrinkage but without contributing to infection, fistula, or seroma. In this review we evaluate the evidence for using each type of available fixation device. A systematic search of the literature, including human as well as animal studies, identified 17 different fixation methods. Their role with regard to effect on major end-points in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair including postoperative pain, infection, seroma formation, adhesions, fixation strength, strength of ingrowth, shrinkage, bowel fistulas, and hernia recurrence, is described in detail. No gold standard exists currently. The vast majority of published results are based on uncontrolled series with short or incomplete follow-up. In this review only three randomized controlled trials were identified. ","884":"There are over 350,000 ventral hernia repairs (VHR) performed in the United States annually and a variety of laparoscopic and open surgical techniques are described and utilized. Complex ventral hernias such as recurrent hernias, those with infected mesh, open wounds, coexisting enteric fistulas, parastomal hernias, and massive hernias-especially those with loss of abdominal domain-require sophisticated repair techniques. Many of these repairs are performed via an open approach. Ideally, the aim is to place mesh under the fascia with a large overlap of the defect and obtain primary fascial closure. However, it is often impossible to bring together fascial edges in very large hernias. Component separation is an excellent surgical technique in selected patients which involves release of the different layers of the abdominal wall and in turn helps accomplish primary fascial approximation. The posterior rectus sheath, external oblique or the transverse abdominis fascia can be cut and allows for closure of fascia in a tension free manner in a majority of patients. In this chapter we describe the various techniques for component separation, indications for use, how to select an appropriate type of release and post-operative outcomes. ","885":"The management of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) is complex. Local tumor resection with disease-free resection margins without lymphadenectomy is the treatment of choice for primary non-metastatic tumors. This can be achieved with several techniques including wedge resection, transgastric resection, partial gastrectomy, total gastrectomy, and multivisceral resection. Open and minimally invasive surgical approaches can be considered. We describe the technical steps of the aforementioned procedures in relation to tumor size, tumor location (especially at or near the gastro-esophageal junction or pylorus), pattern of exophytic or intraluminal growth, adherence to surrounding structures, and other tumor-associated factors. Challenging situations in gastric surgery for GISTs are also discussed and categorized according to a classification of intraoperative complexity (1 [easy] to 4 [very difficult]). On the basis of this classification, we divided all patients with an indication for gastric GIST surgery into appropriate groups. ","886":"Even with considerable operator experience and expertise, surgical access from the abdomen to the mid and low rectum and mesorectum can be difficult, especially in male and obese patients. This holds true whether the approach from above is performed by laparoscopy or laparotomy. While conventional operations that include extirpation of the anal canal and sphincters of course incorporate a perineal approach for the lowermost aspect of the proctectomy, their efficiency in cephalad extension is limited by difficulties in access and visualization. Recently, the concepts behind transanal endoscopic microsurgery\/operation (TEM\/TEO), natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and confined-access\/single-port laparoscopy have synergized to proffer a novel in-line endoscopic approach to the lowermost portion of the rectum in the form of a transanal-transrectal portal either alone or in combination with an abdominal component. This can be done in concert with or without sphincter excision and should both enhance the quality of the surgical specimen and minimize the potential for collateral damage in dissection. While clinical experience is developing, this operative access can already be appreciated both from a technical evolutionary and a clinical benefit perspective and is evidently consistent with the oncological principles of package total mesorectal excison (TME) for neoplasia. Furthermore, while specific \"ideal\" devices evolve, the essential base technological components and access platforms are now widely available while the necessary skillsets either already exist or are readily attained. This state-of-the-art review aims to illustrate the principles behind what appears likely to be the next major laparoendoscopic advance in operative practice for the colorectal and pelvic surgeon.","887":"In general, the development of a tracheocutaneous fistula (TCF) after tracheotomy is a seldom but recurrent clinical problem in long-term ventilated patients. In cases of prolonged wound healing with no spontaneous wound closure or insufficient later closure by secondary suture, different surgical procedures have been previously described for the closure of TCFs. Nonetheless, each procedure has its individually associated complications so that definite closure of TCFs still remains a challenge.

","888":"The current staging system by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) classifies the stages of pressure ulcers (PUs) based on clinical assessment and visual inspection. We postulate that patients presenting with clinically superficial PUs (Stage I and Stage II) will have a greater depth of injury than predicted. On admission, patients with sacral PUs were staged according to the NPUAP classification system. Patients who were classified as having a Stage I or Stage II ulcer or suspected deep tissue injury were assessed with high-frequency (12-MHZ) ultrasonography (US) to identify any evidence of injury to the deep tissue. The study included 20 patients undergoing US for PUs of the sacrum. All patients, regardless of PU stage were found to have some evidence of deep tissue injury upon ultrasonographic examination. In patients with suspected deep tissue injury, we have found US to be a reliable diagnostic tool that confirms the clinical suspicion of deep tissue injury. PUs classified as superficial may have a component of deeper tissue damage.","889":"Wound care is a classic example of a surgical realm with a great variation in care. The diversity in wounds and wound treatments, the limited amount of convincing evidence, and the diverging opinions among doctors and nurses involved in wound care contribute to this undesirable variation in care. For chronic wounds, such as arterial or venous ulcers, pressure sores, and diabetic foot ulcers, but also for acute wounds after surgery or trauma, international and national guidelines provide recommendations on diagnostic procedures and treatment options, but rely mostly on expert opinion. We present the available evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews for the systemic treatment (i.e., not prevention) of patients with wounds, as opposed to topical wound treatments. This evidence shows: - Venous ulcers: High-compression therapy is the classic and evidence-based treatment for treating venous ulcers. Oral pentoxifylline promotes ulcer healing with and without compression therapy. Oral zinc is not effective to heal venous ulcers. - Acute wounds: Recombinant human growth hormone accelerates healing of large burn wounds and donor sites, while high-carbohydrate feeding might reduce the risk of pneumonia. Linezolid is more effective than vancomycin for treating skin and soft tissue infections. Hyperbaric oxygen may help heal crush wounds and skin grafts. Therapeutic touch does not heal acute wounds. - Pressure sores: Air-fluidized and some low-tech devices appear effective for treating existing pressure ulcers. Oral zinc, protein, or vitamin C supplements seem ineffective. Also, evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of repositioning regimes as a treatment option. - Diabetic ulcers: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy and pressure-relieving devices may improve healing rates. - Arterial ulcers: Prostanoids and spinal cord stimulation may be effective in healing ischemic ulcers. Thus, fortunately, some high-level evidence exists for various local and systemic interventions in wound care. Caregivers should be aware of, and apply, the strongest evidence available. Only when all stakeholders (patients, physicians, wound care nurses, but also manufacturers and buyers) implement this available evidence will optimum quality of care for patients with wounds be ensured.","890":"The chronic wound environment and the ideal way in which to regenerate healthy tissue remain enigmas in the field of wound healing. There are multiple modalities that have been evaluated in an attempt to discern the most clinically beneficial and cost-effective treatment strategies for the millions of individuals who suffer from chronic wounds and their associated morbidity. Engineered skin substitutes represent one of the novel and continuously evolving approaches to providing wound coverage and regenerating functional skin.

Secondary aims were manageability and safety of PICO and its feasibility as home therapy. Between 2010 and 2012, 50 patients were assigned to treatment with either PICO (n = 25) or conventional dressings (n = 25). Each patient completed 12-month follow-up. Parameters of interests for primary aim were SSC, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Data on difficulties in managing PICO and device-related complications were also collected. Patients receiving PICO had less SSC, resulting in shorter hospital stay. At last follow-up, readmission rates were lower with PICO. No differences were observed in surgical complications between groups. No patients reported difficulties in managing the device. Among patients discharged with PICO, none needed to come back to the hospital for device malfunctioning or inability to manage it. PICO reduces SSC and length of stay in selected CD patients compared with conventional dressings. The device is safe and user friendly.

The 1-Monocryl suture was chosen because it is widely used by gynecological surgeons in the repair either of the vaginal cuff or the uterine wall defects. Forty specimens of aponeurotic muscle, obtained from abdominal wall of a lamb, were prepared, and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 repair groups: Group A (n = 20) classic repair with 1-Monocryl suture; Group B (n = 20) 0-Quill barbed suture. Each specimen was transected at the midpoint and then repaired. Biomechanical stability of the repaired specimen was verified on a CMT6000 electromechanical universal testing machine (SANS, MTS SYSTEMS, China Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China), with a 1kN cell.

Recently, establishment of comprehensive electronic computerized tomographic databases from a diverse population worldwide have been key innovations in the field of implant development. This technology provides a potential improvement compared to historical techniques of implant design and manufacturing which involved limited trials on cadavers. Segmentation of the computerized data to generate three-dimensional models allows precise and accurate measurements of anatomical structures and may provide better understanding of anthropometric variations that occur among individuals. Evidence-and population-based computational analyses may provide a better tool for designing orthopaedic implants that deliver an enhanced fit for a more diverse patient population. Moreover, these population-based databases can also verify new designs by means of virtual implantation and analysis on specific or large groups of bones within the database.

A decade ago, a modification of the original system added intermittent automated instillation of topical wound irrigation solutions to traditional negative pressure wound therapy. This combined therapy, termed negative pressure wound therapy with instillation (NPWTi), has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of complex wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy with instillation has been shown to reduce bioburden and biofilms present in wounds helping heal clinically infected wounds. It has also been used with success to jump-start stalled wounds, in relieving wound pain and treating infected foreign bodies including infected orthopedic hardware and some types of exposed abdominal wall mesh. The system includes a foam dressing placed in the wound covered by a semi-occlusive drape. A tubing placed over a hole cut in the drape connects the foam dressing to a pump run by a computerized microprocessor that delivers negative pressure to the dressing and wound. A preset volume of instillation fluid is automatically delivered via the instillation tubing to the wound. The fluid is held in the foam to bathe the wound for a predetermined time period. Negative pressure is then re-started draining the irrigation fluid and any wound exudate into a collection canister. The entire sequence is automated and consists of three phases: (1) fluid instillation; (2) holding for a period of time in the wound, which is fully expanded since the negative pressure is off during this phase; and then (3) a cycle of continuous negative pressure. The entire sequence repeats itself automatically. Typically the dressing is changed three times a week. The variables involved in treating patients with negative pressure wound therapy with instillation included: the indicated wound types; the system settings; the choice of the irrigation solution and the duration of therapy.

Surgical reconstruction of umbilical hernias in association with diastasis recti has not been discussed in the recent literature. We describe a novel surgical technique of midline mesh repair for this combined lesion. This is a retrospective review of 44 consecutive patients. Forty-four patients underwent surgery for umbilical hernia with diastasis recti between January 2010 and August 2012. All excess skin, subcutaneous tissue, and distracted midline (linea alba) were excised supraumbilically and paraumbilically according to preoperative marking. Surgical repair began with a midline running suture of the posterior rectal sheath. A light prolene mesh was placed retromuscularly into this sheath and anchored in all directions with a distance of about 5 cm from the midline using U-shaped stitches. The anterior rectal fascia was closed with a continuous suture. All information was obtained from the hospital records. The median operative time was 93.3 minutes (28 to 219 minutes). The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 5.9 days (3 to 12 days). There was no major complication. One minimal umbilical skin necrosis was observed. Analgesic medication was required in all patients. Opiods were added in 84.0% of patients on day 1, in 75.0% on day 3, and in 2.3% on day 7.

It is accepted that this chronic pain caused by abdominal wall weakness or injury occurs without a palpable hernia. We proposed the new name \"pubic inguinal pain syndrome.\" In the period between January 2006 and November 2013 all patients afferent in our ambulatory clinic for chronic groin pain without a clinically evident hernia were assessed with medical history, physical examination, dynamic ultrasound, and pelvic and lumbar MRI. All patients were proposed for a conservative treatment and then, if it was not effective, for a surgical treatment. Our etiopathogenetic theory is based on three factors: (1) the compression of the three nerves of the inguinal region, (2) the imbalance in strength of adductor and abdominal wall muscles caused by the hypertrophy and stiffness of the insertion of rectus muscle and adductor longus muscle, and (3) the partial weakness of the posterior wall. Our surgical procedure includes the release of all three nerves of the region, the correction of the imbalance in strength with the partial tenotomy of the rectus and adductor longus muscles, and the repair of the partial weakness of the posterior wall with a lightweight mesh.

In this issue, we will review the actual evidence about the effect of immunonutrition on the prevention of SSI. ","909":"Rectosigmoid endometriosis is one of the most advanced forms of the disease affecting 3% to 37% of patients with endometriosis. Some patients are asymptomatic but others can develop severe symptoms such as abdominal and pelvic pain, diarrhea, constipation, and rectal bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasonography (USG-TV) with bowel preparation is the first-line investigation in patients with suspected bowel endometriosis and allows accurate determination of the presence of the disease. When endometriosis of rectosigmoid is diagnosed, the USG-TV helps the surgical team to define the appropriate therapeutic strategy, be it surgical or conservative. The surgical management of rectosigmoid endometriosis includes disc resection or segmental bowel resection. In recent years, disc resection has gained adherents; this approach allows the resection of macroscopic disease with fewer complications than segmental bowel resection. However, disc resection is only indicated when a lesion is unifocal, the size does not exceed 3 cm, and it does not involve more than 50% to 60% of circumference of the rectum or sigmoid wall. This article describes the laparoscopic disc resection surgical technique for intestinal deep endometriosis, its feasibility, and its current status. ","910":"Clinical results comparing intermittent intraoperative neuromonitoring (Int-IONM) and continuous IONM (Cont-IONM) for recurrent laryngeal nerve protection are lacking. Int-IONM has been routinely applied in thyroid resection since January 2008. Cont-IONM was added in November 2008 (ISIS; Inomed, Emmendingen, Germany). Rates of vocal cord palsies (VCPs) and the corresponding IONM signals of both methods are compared. Int-IONM was applied in 458 patients and Cont-IONM in 667 patients. Early postoperative VCPs were diagnosed in 4.0% (34\/850 NaR) of the Int-IONM group and in 2.9% (34\/1184 NaR) of the Cont-IONM group (p = n.s.). The permanent palsy rate was 0.7% (n = 6) for the Int-IONM group, while all VCPs of the Cont-IONM group except one recovered within 1 to 5 months (p = 0.01). First mobilizing the gland is an early risk point for loss of signal (LOS) in 19.1% of cases. VCPs were identified in 58.8% to 85.3% by intraoperative LOS. Recognition of the nerve-threatening surgical action is significantly better for Cont-IONM (67.7% vs. 20.6%; p = 0.0008). In this clinical setup the Cont-IONM method reduces permanent VCP rates significantly in comparison with Int-IONM. The continuous evaluation of signals during the various dissection steps reduces and limits irreversible damage and allows the surgeon to pay increased attention to the functioning of the nerve. ","911":"This study aimed to investigate rupture rates following primary flexor tendon repair and to identify potential risk factors of rupture. Fifty-one patients with 100 flexor tendon injuries who underwent primary repair over a one-year period were reviewed. We collected demographic and surgical data. Causes of rupture were examined. Ruptured primary tendon repairs were compared with those that did not rupture. Univariate and multivariate analysis were undertaken to identify significant risk factors. Eleven percent of repaired tendons ruptured with a higher rupture rate noted in the non-dominant hand (p value = 0.009), in Zone II (0.001), and when more than 72 hours surgical delay occurred (0.01). Multivariate regression analysis identified repair in Zone II injuries to be the most significant predictor. Our rate of rupture of 11% was associated with delay in surgery, repair on non-dominant hand, and Zone II repairs. Careful consideration of these factors is crucial to reduce this rate. ","912":"Static solutions for highly motile structures such as the groin seem to represent a procedural incongruence. Another important issue in prosthetic hernia repair is related to the poor quality of tissue ingrowth within conventional flat meshes and plugs. These are all static, passive devices, and thus do not move in synchrony with the natural movements of the groin. In the literature there is a clear understanding of how conventional prostheses used for inguinal hernia repair are incorporated by rigid fibrotic tissue. The term \"scar plate\" well emphasizes this occurrence. The ingrowth of this kind of stiff fibrotic scar leads to mesh shrinkage and to the reduction of the mesh surface area. This is considered a significant cause of recurrence and discomfort. With this in mind, the need for a more physiologic procedure to further decrease complications and recurrences in inguinal hernia repair due to implant design seems obvious. This report shows how, by eliminating invasive fixation and improving the quality of tissue ingrowth within the implant, it is possible to reduce complications. To achieve these results, a new type of 3D dynamic (inherent recoil), self-retaining implant has been developed. This newly designed implant was previously implanted in the porcine model, showing excellent outcomes. Of note were the quality of tissue ingrowth and the near absence of shrinkage, even a long time after implantation. The present study describes the outcome of this device used in open inguinal hernia repair in 91 patients having direct and indirect inguinal hernia. In this patient cohort, evaluations were made for; operation length, intraoperative complications, late complications such as seroma, infection, chronic pain, and pain assessment through VAS score. Patient follow-up was made at 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 36 months. Ultrasound scans were performed for the detection of any possible implant dislodgment, shrinkage, and implant incorporation. The results of this study demonstrate that by using a purposefully designed 30 geometric implant expulsion forces can be switched into gripping forces, avoiding the need for traumatic fixation. This eliminates the typical complications related to mesh fixation such as bleeding, hematoma, chronic pain, and tissue tearing, often resulting in mesh dislodgement and recurrence. This new 30 implant results in open hernia repair procedures being safer, faster, and easier.","913":"In recent years, many efforts have been made to reduce the trauma of surgical access further by the use of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). The Ergo-Lap (ergonomic laparoscopic) simulator was taken to the 20th International Congress of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) in 2012 in Brussels, Belgium. During the congress, the simulator was assessed by 13 general surgeons with different SILS experience using a standardized questionnaire to determine the usability of the Ergo-Lap simulator training for basic SILS skills. Eleven of the 13 participants rated the simulator as an attractive simulator (attractive here means arousing interest of the trainees). For the aspects of training in an ergonomic way, 12 of 13 participants rated it as good to excellent because the work space and task panel location can be adjusted according to the length of instruments. Also, 92% (12 of 13) thought the Ergo-Lap simulator was useful for practicing basic SPLS skills. And 85% (11 of 13) thought it was very easy to use. For SILS skills training, this in~xpensive and portable Ergo-Lap simulator offers a feasible training opportunity to help trainees practice their SILS skills under ergonomic conditions.","914":"In this study, we have described our initial experience and surgical technique of extreme angle screw placement in the cervical and upper thoracic spine of a cohort of patients undergoing posterior fusion. This extreme angle screw facilitates rod placement without need for any coronal contouring of the rod or offset connectors despite the varied entry site locations for posterior instrumentation and the different trajectories and pathways of these screws. From ruary 2011 to July 2011, extreme angle screws were placed in twenty consecutive adult patients who underwent posterior cervical, occipital-cervical or cervical-thoracic fusions. The primary diagnosis was cervical spondylotic myelopathy (13), trauma (4), and pseudoarthrosis with stenosis (3). Eight patients had gross instability. A total of 196 screws were placed; half of the cases involved instrumentation at or within the C3-7 segments (10) and the others included constructs extending to occipital bone, C2, T1, or T2 (10). Of all twenty cases, there were no perioperative hardware complications. At long-term follow-up, two patients required reoperation, one for hardware failure and the other for single level symptomatic pseudoarthrosis. We conclude that extreme angle screw use in the posterior cervical spine provides an evolution in posterior instrumentation that maximizes the biomechanical strength of a construct, allows for easy rod placement, and may improve the restoration of sagittal alignment. Overall, extreme angle screws facilitate rod placement even for screws offset from the natural plane of the rod, thereby avoiding the need for coronal contouring or placement of offset connectors. ","915":null,"916":"Tendon augmentation grafts have the potential to facilitate the repair of massive or otherwise unrepairable rotator cuff tears. In our clinic, between 2009 and 2013, 25 patients underwent surgery to treat massive symptomatic rotator cuff tears with porcine dermal collagen patch. This study is a clinical and instrumental assessment of 9 patients with the longest follow-up. These patients were evaluated with Constant score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Form, ultrasound imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and electromyography. The clinical evaluations have shown good outcomes. The magnetic resonance imaging results were comparable with those of the ultrasound scan. In all cases, we found covering of humeral head, centering of the humeral head, maintenance of the tropism of the supraspinatus, no appearance of fatty degeneration, no worse in cases with fatty degeneration. With the electromyographic examination a complete functional recovery was observed with the possibility of performing maximal contraction against resistance in all cases. We believe that porcine dermal collagen is effective as an augmentation graft in the treatment of chronic extensive rotator cuff tears, providing excellent pain relief with an improvement in active ranges of motion and strength. ","917":"Osteomyelitis is a bone infection by micro-organisms. Despite advances in antibiotics and operative techniques, osteomyelitis remains an orthopaedic challenge and expensive to treat. Antimicrobial therapy is adequate for the treatment of most cases of acute osteomyelitis of any type, provided that diagnosis is made early. The treatment of chronic osteomyelitis is operative followed by adjunctive antibiotic therapy. Apart from surgical debridement and systemic antibiotic treatment, local antibiotic treatment by using various antibiotic delivery vehicles is a preferred method by most surgeons. Antibiotic-loaded bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA) is the most widely used material and represents the current standard as an antibiotic delivery vehicle in orthopaedic surgery. Despite that, there are some disadvantages or concerns about the use of antibiotic-loaded PMMA that have led to the use of bioabsorbable or biodegradable material. Although the number of clinical studies is small, it seems that antibiotic-loaded hydroxyapatite and calcium sulfate are safe methods for local antibiotic delivery. They deliver great amounts of antibiotics locally with serum concentrations in safe margins, they obliterate the dead space, and aid in bone repair, while there is no need for a second operation for their removal. The purpose of this article is to review the recent literature concerning osteomyelitis and local antibiotic treatment with special reference to bone graft substitutes as vehicles for local antibiotic delivery. ","918":"Total hip arthroplasty is increasing in incidence due to our aging population. However, this procedure has a high potential for increased blood loss, with allogeneic blood transfusions commonly used. However, due to potential transfusion-related risks such as immunosuppression or infections, attempts have been made to reduce the amount of blood loss and minimize transfusions. Therefore, our aim was to provide a broad overview of the widely used methods for reducing post-operative blood loss after total hip arthroplasty. These include antifibrinolytic agents, autologous blood transfusion drains, avoiding the use of drains, and modifications in drainage techniques. In addition, lowering the transfusion threshold is another method used to decrease the rates of allogeneic blood transfusion. Current evidence suggests that the use of some of these strategies-either alone, or in combination-may reduce the amount of blood loss and the need for allogeneic transfusions. However, further research is needed to create new, more standardized guidelines. ","919":"This section will complement other recent review articles of blood conservation in total hip arthroplasty. The purpose of this review was to provide a broad overview, as well as to evaluate the recent evidence on surgical intra-operative blood management strategies utilized for total hip arthroplasty. In this section, we specifically evaluated the use of bipolar sealants, patient positioning, wound compression, computer-assisted surgery, minimally invasive surgical approach, and cemented versus noncemented prostheses.","920":"Total hip arthroplasty is associated with extensive blood loss, which is often corrected using allogeneic blood transfusions. However, Jehovah's Witnesses often refuse allogeneic blood transfusions or certain types of autologous blood transfusions due to their religious beliefs. This may represent a tremendous challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon and their team. Performing a total hip arthroplasty on a Jehovah's Witness patient requires a well-trained group of physicians willing to pre-operatively optimize the patient, attempt to minimize the blood loss during the surgery, adequately manage the post-operative period, and be aware of which of the life-saving strategies can be used in these patients during an emergency situation. Ultimately, physicians should be prepared to deal with marked blood loss and respect the patients' wishes, values, and beliefs. This review focuses on studies where primary or revision total hip arthroplasty was performed in Jehovah's Witness patients. Therefore, we will illustrate that with a prepared team and an optimized patient, it is potentially quite safe to perform total hip arthroplasties in Jehovah's Witness patients. ","921":"The substantial blood loss that can occur during total hip arthroplasty frequently requires allogeneic transfusions. Both allogeneic transfusions and post-operative anemia are causes of increased morbidity, cardiovascular risks, and length of stay. This anemia can also lead to decreased vigor, suboptimal rehabilitation, and lowered quality of life in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The aim of this review was to analyze recent evidence on nonsurgical intra-operative blood management strategies utilized for total hip arthroplasty. Specifically, we evaluated the use of fibrin sealants, desmopressin, acute normovolemic hemodilution, hypotensive anesthesia, blood salvage, and peri-operative normothermia. No single strategy has been shown to provide superior results over another in reducing the need for allogeneic transfusions. However, a combination of the above blood management strategies may further result in reduced blood loss over one strategy. Larger prospective randomized studies comparing the individual strategies, as well as their combination, are needed to develop the best algorithm that can be the most effective and safe for intra-operative blood management in total hip arthroplasty. ","922":"Intraoperative motor evoked potentials (MEP) and electromyography (EMG) monitoring in patients with spinal and cranial lesions is a valuable tool for prevention of postoperative motor deficits. The purpose of this study was to determine whether electrophysiological monitoring during skull base, spinal cord, and spinal surgery might be useful for predicting postoperative motor deterioration. From January 2012 to March 2013, thirty-three consecutive patients were studied using intraoperative monitoring (Nuvasive NV-M5 System) to check the integrity of brainstem, spinal cord, and nerve roots, recording transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs) and electromyography. Changes in MEPs and EMGs were related to postoperative deficits. Preoperative diagnosis included skull base and brainstem lesions (6 patients), spinal tumors (11 patients), spinal deformity (16 cases). Using TcMEPs and EMG is a practicable and safe method. MEPs are useful in any surgery in which the brainstem and spinal cord are at risk. EMG stimulation helps to identify an optimal trans-psoas entry point for an extreme lateral lumbar interbody fusion (XLIF) approach to protect against potential nerve injury. This neural navigation technique via a surgeon-interpreted interface assists the surgical team in safely removing lesions and accessing the intervertebral disc space for minimally invasive spinal procedures. ","923":"Total hip arthroplasty is associated with marked blood loss, with the potential for up to 90% of patients requiring allogeneic transfusions. Also, perioperative-induced anemia is associated with lower postoperative functional scores, increased mortality, increased cardiovascular risks, longer hospital stays, and postoperative infections. The purpose of this review was to analyze the recent evidence on preoperative blood management strategies utilized for total hip arthroplasty. Specifically, we evaluated the use of preoperative iron therapy, intravenous erythropoietin, and autologous blood donation. No single strategy was shown to be superior over another in reducing the need for allogeneic transfusions; however, a combination of these blood management strategies may result in improved blood loss outcomes. Larger prospective randomized studies comparing the individual strategies, as well as combination therapies, are needed to develop a concise statement on the most effective and efficient preoperative blood management treatment algorithms for total hip arthroplasty. ","924":"Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) ensures equivalent oncological results while improving overall survival compared with radical nephrectomy when applied to the treatment of small renal masses, moreover warm ischemia is associated with a risk of acute renal failure and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) unclamp NSS is the next step forward in the management of small renal masses. From 2009 to 2013 we have treated 23 patients with small renal masses ( &lt; 4 cm) amenable to the LESS approach using unclamp LESS NSS. In 20 cases we were able to complete the operation using LESS, in 3 cases conversion to standard laparoscopy was required. Pathologic examination revealed 16 cases of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 4 cases of renal cysts, 2 oncocytomas, and 1 angiomyolipoma. We did not find any significant variation in renal function or any case of tumor recurrence, and the majority of the patients were very satisfied of the cosmetic results. LESS unclamp partial nephrectomy is a safe and feasible procedure, oncological outcomes are similar to standard laparoscopy, there is an advantage with respect to renal function and cosmesis, although the procedure is more technically demanding compared with standard laparoscopy.","925":null,"926":"Laparoscopic suturing and knot tying are some of the most difficult surgical skills to acquire, and are often times regarded as a rate-limiting step in the performance of advanced gynecologic endoscopic procedures. Automated suturing devices can significantly decrease the steep learning curve of this task but still require laparoscopic knot tying. Barbed sutures offer several advantages including rapid, consistent wound closure with even distribution of tension across the wound, the suture holds tension on its own, the need for knot tying with associated issues related to suture tensile strength and knot security is eliminated, and suturing time is decreased. Use of a barbed suture with an automated suturing device can offer many advantages to both the novice and the experienced surgeon, including increased efficiency, more uniform wound closure, and the ability to perform a laparoscopic continuous running stitch without the need for intracorporeal knot tying.","927":null,"928":null,"929":"Hysteroscopic myomectomy (HM), first described by Neuwirth and Amin in 1976,1 is an important technique in the management of selected women presenting with infertility, abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), or both.

The author describes his technique of sonographically guided hysteroscopic myomectomy (SGHM). SGHM allows one to continuously monitor the progress of resectoscopic surgery while minimizing the risk of uterine perforation and permitting one to incorporate non-resectoscopic morcellation. The combination of both resectoscopic and non-resectoscopic techniques enable one to safely and efficiently remove submucous leiomyomas without the risk of excessive fluid absorption.

It is estimated that approximately 1.5 to 3.0 per 1,000 adults have active leg ulcers, and the prevalence continues to increase due to an aging population. Management of chronic edema using compression is crucial to promote healing of venous leg ulcers. The principle of compression therapy is simple, involving the use of external pressure in the forms of bandages or wraps to move the fluid from the interstitial space back into the intravascular compartment and prevent reflux. This article synthesizes and appraises the evidence for various types of compression therapies. It also addresses best practice recommendations for the management of leg ulcers when arterial circulation is considered suboptimal.

","932":"Spinous process fixation (SPF) is presented as less invasive than pedicle screws. There has been little quantitative data to support this assertion, and \"minimally invasive\" has not been well defined in spine surgery. Length of stay (LOS) and blood loss (BL) were chosen as surrogate measures of \"minimally invasive.\" A chart review was conducted on 192 lumbar fusion patients (374 levels). A backward-selection multiple-linear-regression was performed to determine what variables contribute to LOS and estimated blood loss (EBL). A logistic regression controlling for age and number of levels on complication rates was also performed. Number of levels with supplementary screw fixation (SSF) was significantly associated with LOS (p = 0.003). Controlling for number of surgical levels, LOS increased by 0.30 days (95% CI: 0.02-0.58) for each level with SSF. For each additional level including SSF, BL increases by 25.31 cc (95% CI: 3.50-47.12, p = 0.023). Interbody fusion increases blood loss by 68.16 cc (95% CI: 17.18-119.13, p = .009). For each additional level with SSF, odds of perioperative complications increase by OR = 2.34 (95% CI: 1.35-4.05). Long-term complications were not affected by instrumentation. LOS and BL are increased in patients with SSF vs. SPF only. Odds of perioperative complications are increased in patients with SSF relative to those treated with SPF alone. ","933":"Leg length discrepancy post total hip arthroplasty surgery is common. Unequal leg lengths after total hip arthroplasty is the single most common reason for litigation against orthopaedic surgeons. Different methods for leg length assessment are used intraoperatively by surgeons, but no one method is 100% reliable and reproducible. The aim of this study was to compare 2 methods of intraoperative leg length assessment. Leg length discrepancy of 5 mm or less was achieved in 72.5% (37\/51) of patients using method 1 and in 67% (34\/51) of patients using method 2. Both methods assessed produced a discrepancy of greater than 5 mm in about a quarter of the patients. The difference was not found to be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Assessment of leg lengths intraoperatively is challenging even for experienced surgeons. The leg lengths may be better restored if more than one method of assessment is used during surgery. ","934":"Femoral revision total hip arthroplasty may be a complex procedure due to extensive periprosthetic bone loss. Fluted, tapered stems provide secure axial and rotational stability in the distal femur. We retrospectively evaluated the long-term outcome of the cementless Wagner Self-Locking prosthesis (Sulzer Orthopedics Ltd, Winterthur, Switzerland). From 1992 to 1998, 68 consecutive femoral revisions were performed in 66 patients using the Wagner tapered stem. Twenty-five patients deceased for unrelated causes without additional surgery. The studied group consisted of 41 hips in 41 patients, 12 males and 29 females, aged from 29 to 80 years (mean 61 years). Thirty-five hips (85.4%) included severe deficiency of bone stock. A transfemoral approach was carried out in 32 cases (78%). Bone grafting was never supplemented. Average follow-up was 13.9 years (range 10.4 to 15.8 years). Clinical evaluation was performed using Harris Hip Score (HHS). Osseointegration of the stem and progression of periprosthetic bone remodelling were assessed radiographically. Five stems required rerevision because of deep infection (2), progressive subsidence (2) complicated by hip instability and head-neck disassembly, and old dislocation following acetabular component failure (1). Four hips (9.7%) dislocated, and 8 stems (19.5%) subsided significantly. Average HHS improved from 33 points preoperatively to 75 points at the latest follow-up examination (p &lt; 0.001). Thirty-three of the 36 unrevised stems (91.7%) had radiographic evidence of bone ingrowth. A constant or decreased resorption of the femoral bone was detected in 34\/36 patients (94.4%). The cumulative survival rates at 15.8 years with femoral revision for any reason and for stem failure as the end points were 92.0% and 96.6%, respectively. The current study documents the efficacy of distal fixation to the diaphysis in revision of bone-deficient femoral components, supporting the use of tapered, fluted stems. Higher-risk complications (dislocation, subsidence) should be minimized by the development of modular stems. ","935":"Lumbar spinal fusion is a well-established surgical procedure for many spinal conditions. Posterior instrumentation may be added to provide immediate stabilization and improve fusion rates. Spinous process fixation, a type of posterior fixation, offers a less-invasive option to pedicle or facet screws with quantitative evidence of similar biomechanical stabilization; however, little has been published on the use of these devices. Further, there has been confusion about the use of spinous process fixation devices versus spinous process spacers. Spinous process fixation devices provide spine surgeons with another option for instrumented fusion, offering potential advantages for select patients. Biomechanical data suggest that relative to pedicle screws, modern spinous process fixation devices provide equivalent stability with reduced clinical risk and a less-invasive surgical procedure. These devices need to be distinguished from spacers, which are non-fixation devices. ","936":"This article examines factors associated with performing a laparoscopic hysterectomy in a stepwise fashion and addresses the technique and cost effectiveness of this procedure compared with abdominal hysterectomy. We review techniques of the laparoscopic hysterectomy as well difficulties that may be encountered throughout the procedure. The hysterectomy is profiled in a method that provides a reproducible system that allows surgeons to increase their surgical numbers and comfort level. When assessing cost-benefit analysis, the cost of hysterectomy is primarily influenced by the operative time, length of hospital stay, equipment, and complications. Robotic and laparoscopic hysterectomy had the highest mean hospital charges. The laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy provides better rates of recovery, length of stay, and hospital cost. The use of the stepwise approach to hysterectomy may allow surgeons to readily perform the procedure and also identify areas and techniques that need improvement. Regardless of age, body mass index (BMI), comorbities, and other nonclinical factors, the laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with abdominal hysterectomy and vaginal hysterectomy has been shown to be better for the patient's recovery and quality of life. ","937":"Randomized studies support the closure of midline incisions with a suture length to wound length ratio (SL:WL) of more than 4, accomplished with small tissue bites and short stitch intervals to decrease the risk of incisional hernia and wound infection. We investigated practical aspects of this technique possibly hampering the introduction of this technique. Patient data, operative variables and SL:WL ratio were collected at two hospitals: Sundsvall Hospital (SH) and Erasmus University Medical Center (EMC). A structured implementation of the technique had been performed at SH but not at EMC. Personnel were interviewed by questionnaire. At each hospital, 18 closures were analyzed. Closure time was significantly longer (p = 0.023) at SH (median 18 minutes, range: 9-59) than at EMC (median 13 minutes, range: 5-23). An SL:WL ratio of more than 4 was achieved in 8 of 18 cases at EMC and in all 18 cases at SH. We conclude that calculation of an SL:WL ratio is easily performed. Suturing with the small bite-short stitch interval technique of SH required 5 minutes extra, outweighing the morbidity of incisional hernia. Without a structured implementation to suture with an SL:WL ratio of more than 4, a lower ratio is often achieved.

Safety and complication rates, as well as cost data, should guide the techniques used for pediatric laparoscopic appendectomy. Based on the literature available there is not a clear answer as to the best method for closing the appendiceal stump in pediatric patients, with each of the methods described providing safe closure.

We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected, single-center database of 33 patients with main thoracic AIS treated with greater than 80% pedicle screws. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received Amicar (Yes), or did not receive any antifibrinolytics and Ponte osteotomies (No). Demographic, radiographic, and intraoperative data were compared between the two groups. Seventeen patients were treated with Amicar (Yes) (10 of whom had Ponte osteotomies) and 16 patients had neither antifibrinolytics nor Ponte osteotomies (No). The two groups had similar preoperative main Cobb angles, major curve flexibility, and gender. Despite longer operating times and a majority of patients receiving Ponte osteotomies, the Amicar group had a significantly lower EBL and homologous blood transfusion rate. Autologous transfusion volume was less in the Amicar group and trended toward significance. There were no differences in mean arterial pressure during surgery. There were no complications in either group. Amicar reduces EBL and homologous transfusion requirements in patients with main thoracic AIS undergoing PSF with pedicle screws and Ponte osteotomies.

Compared with myomectomy by laparotomy, the laparoscopic approach is associated with shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, less postoperative pain, and reduced adhesion formation. Laparoscopic myomectomy is technically challenging, and occasionally the procedure needs to be completed by laparotomy. In this review, I will describe my team's experience with laparoscopic myomectomy and discuss factors contributing to failure. The most important factors affecting conversion of a laparoscopic myomectomy to laparotomy are patient selection and the laparoscopic expertise of the surgeon. Each surgeon should determine his or her criteria for laparoscopic myomectomy. Other factors include posterior intramural location, soft consistency associated with the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), the diameter of the dominant myoma, and the weight of the myoma. The use of robot-assisted technology may provide a means to overcome the challenges encountered with enucleation, extraction, and repair that are seen with conventional laparoscopic myomectomy.

We carried out 8 THR with the aid of 3-D reconstruction and RP. After each procedure a questionnaire was submitted to the surgeon to assess the perceived added value of the technology. In all cases, the surgeon evaluated the 3-D model as useful in order to perform the planning. The clinical results showed a mean increase in the Harris Hip Score of about 42.5 points. The mean time of prototyping was 7.3 hours, (min 3.5 hours, max 9.3 hours). The mean surgery time was 65 minutes (min 50 minutes, max 88 minutes). Our study suggests that meticulous preoperative planning is necessary in front of a great aberration of the joint and in absence of normal anatomical landmarks, CT scan is mandatory, and 3-D reconstruction with solid model is useful. ","947":"A new class of suturing material, barbed suture, was recently added to the surgeon's armamentarium. It was initially used in open surgery for soft tissue approximation. Its applications in laparoscopic surgery quickly flourished because it eliminates the time-consuming process of extracorporeal and intracorporeal knot tying. Data supporting the use of barbed suture for the repair of bladder and bowel injuries is still scarce. As a matter of fact, many surgeons still use conventional sutures, secured with knots, when facing a cystotomy or an enterotomy. Choosing the best suture material for a specific surgical procedure lies in a thorough understanding of the suture properties. In this article, we shed light on the characteristics that make barbed suture attractive for bladder and bowel repair and illustrate our surgical approach for cystotomy and enterotomy repair using this novel suture material. Based on our experience at Magee-Womens Hospital, barbed suture provides adequate tension-free repairs and improves the efficiency of laparoscopic suturing when closing bladder or bowel defects. As we have so far not encountered any complications, we conclude that repairing cystotomies and enterotomies with barbed suture is feasible and safe.

However, the past 18 years has also witnessed a significant shift in the way NPWT is utilized. Meeting the demands and wound care needs of an ever-growing population has resulted in several other companies releasing their versions of the NWPT device. Although there is a significant body of literature supporting the science and clinical advantages of the KCI system, the newer systems differ in terms of suction devices, connecting tubing, and wound interface materials. It cannot be assumed that the newly developed devices have the same science and clinical advantages as the KCI System. The purpose of this article is to review the science behind NPWT, assess and compare the currently available devices, and examine the scientific literature supporting the efficiency and application of NPWT in wound reconstruction.","949":null,"950":null,"951":null,"952":"The aim of this article is to present a new, modified shorter obturator sling with an inside-out transobturator trajectory for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). It is a method that proves efficient, is reproducible, and is associated with less postoperative pain when compared with the conventional method. The modified procedure involves the use of less tape and reduced dissection in the obturator space, while pursuing a more medial approach. Tape length was shortened, with placement of non-absorbable suture loops at either end to adjust the sling. At the mid-portion of the sling, a removable loop suture ensures equidistance. This is the only mini-sling that can be adjusted allowing one to modify terminal placement along an anterior\/posterior axis. The incidence of immediate postoperative groin pain was reduced by 35% in the modified technique as compared with the original inside-out transobturator approach. There was also reduction of immediate pain severity by +\/- 50%. In addition, the modified approach required less analgesics, less time in the operating room, and a shortened time until discharge home. ","953":"Standardization of the intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) technique is an essential aspect of modern monitored thyroid surgery. The standardized technique involves vagal nerve stimulation. VN stimulation is useful for technical problem solving, detecting non-recurrent laryngeal nerve (non-RLN), recognizing any recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) lesions, and precisely predicting RLN postoperative function. Herein, we present technical notes for the VN identification to achieve the critical view of safety of the VN stimulation with or without dissection. ","954":"Tourniquets provide a bloodless field in limb operations and their introduction in orthopaedic operative technique has been considered as a landmark. A new tourniquet device, a silicone ring tourniquet (SRT) (HemaClear or S-MART, OHK Medical Devices, Haifa, Israel), was introduced into clinical practice a few years ago. A few clinical studies as well as comparative studies in volunteers have reported its use in a relatively small number of cases. The aim of this prospective study is to report the clinical use of this device in a large number of patients, including all possible applications of a tourniquet. The SRT was used in 536 cases including 337 male and 119 female patients with a mean age of 43.7 years (range 6 to 87 years). The average tourniquet time was 58.5 minutes (range 6 to 180 minutes). It was applied in 362 (67.5%) elective and in 174 (32.5%) trauma cases including fractures (n:109, 62.6%) and soft-tissue injuries (n:65, 37.4%). The most frequent application site was the femur (n:255, 47.6%), followed by the forearm (n:154, 28.7%), humerus (n:65, 12.1%), and calf (n:62, 11.6%). Because the device is sterile it was possible to use it in operations in which the pneumatic tourniquet cannot be used, such as open reduction and internal fixation of humeral shaft and femoral supracondylar fractures. In 14 patients (2.6%), the tourniquet failed intraoperatively, and the cause was an unexpected raised blood pressure. The SRT - with a pre-set pressure according to the size and the tension model - is easy to apply. It is sterile, and occupies a narrow area of the limb. Its application combines three functions at the same time: exsanguination, tourniquet, and stockinet application. Although it cannot entirely replace the classic pneumatic tourniquet, it is a safe and useful device in orthopaedic operations because of its advantages. ","955":null,"956":"With the introduction of laparoscopy more than 20 years ago, the surgeon has been confronted with several new challenges. First, the loss of the depth perception (two-dimensional [2D] vision) is a clear handicap during the initial learning curve. Then, the reduced dexterity with the current available instruments remains a drawback of classic minimally invasive surgery. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the advent of robotic surgery has given back the three-dimensional (3D) vision thanks to the two camera channels. In addition, the dexterity was restored, with the \"endowristed\" technology (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). In parallel, several groups have tested and evaluated new cameras for 3D laparoscopy with interesting results. Yet, the real advantages have still to be proven. On the other hand, restoring the 3D vision is clearly a step forward to all the possibilities associated with augmented reality. Reviewing the current literature, this article shows the interest in the use of 3D technology for laparoscopic surgery. In addition, future trends are explored, especially those concerning augmented and virtual reality coupled with 3D technology. ","957":null,"958":"Management of all types of hernias continues to evolve as technology evolves. Prosthetic options continue to play a pivotal role in selection of techniques for hernia repair. There are 3 broad categories of prosthetics including synthetic, biologic, and the new absorbable biosynthetics. Paralleling prosthetic technology is the evolution of fixation for laparoscopic and open hernia techniques. Evaluations of new permanent and absorbable fixation methods are ongoing by multiple companies. There is a great interest in adhesives for mesh fixation as well as self-adhering prosthetics. Studies in fixation revolve around understanding the compromise between fixation strength and pain caused by different fixation methods. Understanding of the biomechanical properties of fixation options coupled with the understanding of the thresholds of force created by the functional abdominal wall are key to optimizing surgical technique. The clinical ramifications of furthering our understanding of all of these technologies will impact perspectives on future technique selection for hernia repair. ","959":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) using minimally invasive surgery (MIS) can result in soft tissue damage during the trial reduction and actual implantation. We present a surgical technique that reduces soft tissue trauma and facilitates implant reduction while protecting the prosthetic head from scratching during MIS THA. Primary THA using MIS was performed in 16 hips through a transgluteul direct lateral approach. Average follow-up was 54 months (range 52-58 months). At latest follow-up there was no evidence for component dissociation or loosening in any of the patients. Reverse assembly of THA components is a viable option, which may facilitate MIS THA and decrease soft tissue trauma.

It can result in significant patient distress and disability, with repeated surgeries, increased cost and utilization of medical resources, and in rare cases even mortality. The biggest challenge to date is the correct diagnosis of periprosthetic infection and implementation of effective treatment regimens capable of eradicating the organism. This article reviews the various modalities used in the imaging of periprosthetic and post-arthroplasty infection. ","962":null,"963":"This case series assesses the pre- and postoperative disability outcomes and complications after repeat micro lumbar discectomy (MLD) combined with an interspinous process fusion in patients with recurrent lumbar disc herniation. Four consecutive patients with recurrent lumbar disc herniation subsequent to their primary discectomy, who failed conservative nonoperative management, underwent repeat MLD and posterior instrumented fusion with an interspinous process plate. Before surgery and at follow-up, patients completed the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Demographic information, length of stay, estimated blood loss, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. The mean patient age was 45 years. Patients experienced minimal blood loss during surgery. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Mean operating time was 136 minutes. Mean hospital stay was 1 day. Mean ODI score was reduced from 83.5 preoperatively to 37.0 postoperatively at a mean follow-up time of 12.9 months. As of last follow-up (mean 387 days), no patient has had symptomatic recurrence of herniation or evidence of subsequent instability. ","964":"The repair of complex abdominal wall defects in contaminated fields often presents a dilemma for general surgeons. Synthetic mesh, although strong, may lead to chronic infection or even visceral erosion. Leaving the abdomen open presents challenges for ward management and delays definitive care, as well as allowing the musculature to retract over time. Numerous biological mesh alternatives have arisen over the previous decade, which may make primary closure in this setting a practical alternative, although durability may prove the downside. Here we present our local experience with PermacolTM mesh (Porcine Acellular Dermal Matrix - PADM; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) in four challenging cases and discuss the role this relatively new mesh may have for these and other applications.

In the last few years, there have been numerous advancements to commercially available devices making the endovascular approach more attractive and efficacious. This review serves to detail the similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages of currently available endovascular stent-grafts as well as preview future and emerging technologies in endovascular aortic therapies.","967":"The principle of fluorescence angiography using indocyanine green has been known for a long time and was used especially by photographs and ophthalmologists for retinal diagnostics. After one publication about perfusion control in open surgery we were the first who examined the perfusion of colorectal anastomoses by laparoscopic fluorescence angiography intraoperatively. Since 2008, 49 laparoscopic operations (45 colorectal anastomoses, 4 gastric sleeve resections) were performed using the fluorescence control. In all cases a correct perfusion of the anastomotic\/stapler region could be shown. In cases of decreased perfusion a resection of this area could have been necessary. The laboratory tests with isolated, perfused pig colon could show areas with hypoperfusion after dissection of segmental arteries. Laparoscopic fluorescence angiography could become a standard method to detect a decreased perfusion intraoperatively. Further studies will be needed to show if the rate of anastomotic insufficiency can be lowered by using this new method.","968":"The purpose of this study is to report on the surgical preferences of international surgeons in the performance of the sacrocolpopexy procedure. Invitations to complete this Internet-based survey were sent to 2,854 International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) members from December 2010 through February 2011. Questions were related to various aspects of the surgeons' techniques and preferences in the performance of a sacrocolpopexy procedure by the abdominal, laparoscopic, and robotic routes. Descriptive statistics are reported. A total of 235 members from six continents completed the survey. Ninety percent of the respondents perform sacrocolpopexy procedures in their practices, including abdominal (n = 177), laparoscopic (n = 92), and robotic (n = 48) procedures. Participants reported reduced blood loss, shorter hospitalization, and longer operative time during laparoscopic and robotic procedures compared with open abdominal sacrocolpopexy, but no differences were reported in overall major complications. Overall, surgical preferences and techniques of international surgeons for sacrocolpopexy were similar among responders, regardless of the surgical route performed.","969":"Mitral valve (MV) insufficiency is the second most common heart valve disease represented in cardiac surgery. The gold standard therapy is surgical repair of the valve. Today, most centers prefer a minimally invasive approach through a right-sided mini-thoracotomy. Despite the small access, there is still the need to use cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and the operation has to be performed on the arrested heart. New devices have been developed to optimize the results of surgical repair by implementing mechanisms for post-implantation adjustment on the beating heart or the avoidance of CPB. Early attempts with adjustable mitral annuloplasty rings go back to the early 1990s. Only a few devices are available on the market. Recently, a mitral valve adjustable annuloplasty ring was CE-marked and is under further clinical investigation. In addition, a sutureless annuloplasty band to be implanted on the beating heart is under preclinical and initial clinical investigation for transatrial and transfemoral transcatheter implantation. Furthermore, new neochord systems are being developed, which allow for functional length adjustment on the beating heart after implantation. Some devices were developed for percutaneous MV repair implanted into the coronary sinus to reshape the posterior MV annulus. Other percutaneous devices are directly fixed to the posterior annulus to alter its shape. Several disadvantages have been observed preventing a broad clinical use of some of these devices. There is a continuous effort to develop innovative techniques to optimize MV repair and to decrease invasiveness.","970":"We report the resection of a vaginal septum while preserving the virginity of a 12-year-old girl with Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich Syndrome (HWWS) having a didelphys uterus, obstructed hemivagina, and an ipsilateral renal agenesis with follow-up at 18 months. Successful resection of the vaginal septum with conservation of the hymenal ring and complete drainage of both the hematocolpos and the hematometra were achieved. Cyclic dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain were completely resolved on follow-up visits at 4, 6, and 18 months. Office hysteroscopy performed during the last follow-up visit revealed a patent vaginal vault without evidence of adenosis or recurrence of the vaginal septum. Vaginoscopy is a safe, convenient, and efficient diagnostic and therapeutic modality that can be used in the management of patients with an obstructed hemivagina. It maintains the patient's virginity and it is useful in patients with a restrictive vaginal opening or narrow vaginal canal. Furthermore, the hysteroscopic excision of the vaginal septum offers minimal risk of recurrence of the septal defect.","971":"Transforaminal endoscopic spine surgery is increasingly used to treat a range of spinal conditions. The success of the surgery requires an accurate insertion of the guide needle and a precise placement of the working cannula and endoscope. However, such a precise placement is challenging for many surgeons to achieve when the pathology is located at the L5-S1 level. On the basis of our years of experience with performing transforaminal endoscopic spine surgery, we have developed a simple technique to help surgeons safely access the L5-S1 level. The technique has been proven intuitive and easy for experienced as well as inexperienced surgeons to learn. The key steps of the technique involve identifying an appropriate entry point on the skin and choosing an accurate trajectory angle for insertion. The purpose of this chapter is to report how to easily identify the entry point and choose a trajectory angle depending on the patient's anatomic characteristics.","972":"As technology has evolved, so has the ability to perform a hysterectomy in a minimallly invasive fashion. Currently, total laparoscopic hysterectomy has been further advanced with the advent of uterine manipulation devices that incorporate the use of a cupped colpotomizer. Unfortunately, many gynecologic surgeons lack the understanding of how to fully utilize such a surgical guide to facilitate development of the vesico-uterine reflection, skeletonize uterine vasculature, gain entry into the vagina, and subsequently close the vaginal cuff. Safe completion of these steps has the potential to minimize complications such as ureteral and bladder injury in addition to vaginal cuff dehiscence. The following technical review will address methods for the safe and effective use of various cupped colpotomizer devices during total laparoscopic hysterectomy.","973":"Endometrial ablation and hysteroscopic myomectomy and polypectomy are having an increasing impact on the care of women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). The complications of these procedures include the late onset of recurrent vaginal bleeding, cyclic lower abdominal pain, hematometra and the inability to adequately sample the endometrium in women with postmenopausal bleeding. According to the 2007 ACOG Practice Bulletin, approximately 24% of women treated with endometrial ablation will undergo hysterectomy within 4 years. By employing careful cervical dilation, a wide variety of gynecologic resectoscopes, and continuous sonographic guidance it is possible to explore the entire uterine cavity in order to locate areas of sequestered endometrium, adenomyosis, and occult hematometra. Sonographically guided reoperative hysteroscopy offers a minimally invasive technique to avoid hysterectomy in over 60% to 88% of women who experience endometrial ablation failures. The procedure is adaptable to an office-based setting and offers a very low incidence of operative complications and morbidity. In addition, the technique provides a histologic specimen, which is essential in adequately evaluating the endometrium in postmenopausal women or women at high risk for the development of adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.","974":"Physiomesh is a novel, lightweight, large pore, polypropylene mesh designed to have flexibility that matches the compliance of the abdominal wall in an effort to improve patient quality of life (QOL). The International Hernia Mesh Registry was queried for ventral hernia repair (VHR) and inguinal hernia repair (IHR) with Physiomesh. Demographics, operative and postoperative details, and the Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) as a measure of QOL were recorded. Physiomesh was used in 100 patients, 29 IHR and 71 VHR. Their average age was 56.8 +\/- 13.7, and BMI was 34.0 +\/- 21.0 kg\/m2. For IHR, preoperative pain (CCS &gt; or = 2) was present in 41%, but decreased at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively to 25.9%, 0%, and 1.6%, while movement limitation decreased from 42.9% to 18.5%, 1.6%, and 3.1%. There were no complications or recurrences. The average VHR measured 66.4 cm2; 93% underwent a laparoscopic repair. Pain was present in 59.1% preoperatively but 21% at 12 months. Movement limitations reduced from 43.2% to 15.8% at 12 months. Mesh sensation was reported in only 10.5% at 1 year. There was 1 recurrence. Physiomesh is well tolerated by patients undergoing IHR and VHR. It is associated with a very favorable long-term QOL.","975":"With an increasing number of cesareans and repeat cesarean deliveries, clinicians have started to realize the importance of adhesions after cesarean delivery. Adhesions develop more frequently and with increasing severity with each repeat cesarean, and are associated with increasing maternal morbidity especially bladder injury and increased delivery time. It appears that adhesion formation could be reduced with closure of the peritoneum, double-layer closure of the uterine incision, and the use of adhesion barrier. In many reports of adhesion formation after cesarean delivery, authors have used different methods to evaluate adhesions. We encourage clinicians to adopt a newly published site-specific classification of adhesions after caesarean delivery.","976":"Venous thromboembolic disease remains a serious complication following lower extremity total joint arthroplasty. Postoperative thromboembolic complications, which include symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, bleeding, and pulmonary embolus, are recognized causes of patient morbidity, mortality, increased length of stay, and higher healthcare costs. Various thromboprophylaxis guidelines have been recommended to prevent and thereby reduce the incidence of such events. However, despite various studies exploring prophylaxis measures, the incidence of venous thromboembolic events has remained relatively unchanged over the past 10 years. We therefore aimed to: (1) evaluate the current 2011 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommendations concerning venous thromboembolic disease after lower extremity joint arthroplasty; and (2) report on different modalities of prophylaxis, specifically, pharmacological agents, mechanical compression devices, and inferior vena cava filters. Both AAOS and ACCP guidelines recommend a combined approach with mechanical compression devices and pharmacological prophylaxis. A major difference is that the AAOS work group does not recommend specific pharmacological agents, whereas the ACCP guidelines give specific recommendations. Additionally, routine primary thromboprophylaxis with inferior vena cava filters is only recommended when there are contraindications to anticoagulation therapy.","977":"Periprosthetic infection is an increasingly prevalent and challenging problem in joint reconstruction. We present a technical report of a custom spacer for management of an infected total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and concomitant severe bone loss. The spacer was designed to provide sufficient leg length, soft tissue tension, and limb stability in preparation for ultimate limb reconstruction. This technique and custom spacer serve as an alternative for managing significant bone loss in infected knee arthroplasty.","978":"Recently, extensive data have been published about the safety and efficacy of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Barrett's esophagus (BE) with early cancer and dysplasia as well as without dysplasia. RFA has been shown to be effective and safe. Circumferential RFA is delivered using the HALO(360+) Ablation System (Covidien, Inc., Mansfield, MA), which consists ofa high-power energy generator, a sizing balloon catheter, and a number of balloon-based ablation catheters with varying outer diameters. Focal RF energy is delivered using the HALO(90) or HALO(60) Ablation Systems (Covidien, Inc., Mansfield, MA), consisting of a radiofrequency energy generator and an endoscope-mounted electrode. Both RFA systems have official approval to be used in the United States, Europe, and other countries for the treatment of BE as well as in patients with gastric antral vascular ectasia and radiation proctopathy. With increasing widespread use of these systems, a full mastery of the equipment and therapeutic technique is essential to maximize eradication rates of BE while maintaining patient safety. A cost-effective patient selection and eradication protocol for RFA is essential to success with this technique in patients with BE. This article will discuss our experience with RFA treatment of BE using the HALO system for effective eradication of Barrett's dysplasia and early Barrett's cancer and review available data especially from the U.S. National Registry.","979":"The goal of modern laparoscopic hernia repair is to achieve a high standard of patient safety with a low threshold of hernia recurrence and chronic inguinal pain. In the absence of fixating devices and the use of the self-gripping Parietene and Parietex ProGrip mesh (Covidien AG, Zurich, Switzerland) was evaluated in this prospective clinical study. The incidence of chronic pain, postoperative complications, patient satisfaction, and hernia recurrence at follow-up after 12 and 24 months was recorded. Data were collected retrospectively from patient files and were analyzed for 405 male and female patients with 483 primary inguinal hernias. All patients included had undergone surgical repair for inguinal hernia by the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach using Parietex ProGrip meshes performed in the same clinical center in Germany. Pre-, peri-, and postoperative data were collected and a follow-up after 12 and 24 months was performed prospectively. Complications, pain scored on a 0 to 10 NRS scale, patient satisfaction, and hernia recurrence were assessed. The only complications were minor and were postoperative: hematoma\/seroma (nine cases), secondary hemorrhage through the trocar's site (eight cases), hematuria, emphysema in the inguinal regions (both sides), and swelling above the genital organs (one case for each). Two patients had to be reoperated due to a hematoma in inguinal canal. At mean follow-up at 22.8 months, there were only eight reports of hernia recurrence: 1.9% of the hernias. Most patients (94.9%) were satisfied or very satisfied with their hernia repair with only 1.2% reporting severe pain (NRS score 7 to 10) and 3.6% reported mild pain. This study demonstrates that, in experienced hands, inguinal hernia repair surgery performed by laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty using Parietene and Parietex ProGrip self-gripping meshes is rapid, efficient, and safe with low pain and low hernia recurrence rate. Since no fixating device or glue is necessary for the procedure, additional cost-effectiveness is achieved. ","980":"This study evaluates the results of treating neuropathic diabetes mellitus (DM) foot ulcers with Achilles tendon percutaneous complete tenotomy. To the authors' knowledge this study is the largest of this nature to date. One hundred twenty-seven patients with Wagner Grade 1 to 4 foot ulcers were treated with percutaneous Achilles complete tenotomy between January 2007 and December 2010. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia and sedation in the operating room. The foot was held in maximum dorsiflexion, while the tendon was cut and completely released. The surgical site was dressed in a well-padded sterile dressing and wrap. Patients steadily increased their tolerance to walking in a post-op shoe. One hundred twenty-one patients who underwent percutaneous complete tenotomy experienced healing of their ulcers. To date, no Achilles contracture recurrences have been reported. Three patients experienced treatment-related adverse events. An additional six patients had recalcitrant ulcers requiring further therapy. Our findings in 127 patients with neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers add further credence to the growing evidence that percutaneous complete tenotomy of the Achilles tendon is a viable approach to treat Wagner Grade 1 to 4 foot ulcers.","981":"Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common problem requiring surgical correction in up to 19% of women. Abdominal sacrocolpopexy (SCP) is considered the gold standard treatment for apical POP and has been associated with lower rates of recurrent prolapse and dyspareunia compared with vaginal POP repair procedures. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) with concurrent laparoscopic uterosacral ligament (USL) vaginal vault suspension provides a safe and effective alternative technique that has efficacy rates similar to abdominal SCP without the use of synthetic mesh. The uterosacral ligaments provide a strong supportive tissue for vaginal vault suspension that mimics the natural support system of the pelvic floor. The most challenging aspect of the TLH with laparoscopic USL suspension is laparoscopic suturing and intra\/extracorporeal knot tying. Developing technologies such as robotics, automatic suturing devices, and new barbed suture materials are now providing simpler, alternative surgical techniques that will hopefully shorten operative times and increase adoption of this surgical procedure by gynecologists. With continued progress and refinement of this technique, the TLH with laparoscopic USL suspension may challenge the current standard of care for surgical treatment of POP.","982":"Traditional laparoscopic suturing and knot tying requires a steep learning curve and is often the rate-limiting step in performing advanced laparoscopic gynecologic surgical procedures. It is particularly challenging due to difficulties with tissue handling and needle control while performing the procedure on a two-dimensional screen, oftentimes at unfavorable suturing angles. Automated suturing devices have greatly simplified the process and allow less-experienced surgeons to safely and efficiently perform laparoscopic suturing and knot tying. The Endo Stitch (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) is a 10-mm single-use suturing device that allows placement of multiple suture types during laparoscopic surgery, and simplifies the process of laparoscopic knot tying. The SILS Stitch (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) is based on the same technology as the Endo Stitch with the added advantage of articulation up to 75 degrees and rotation up to 360 degrees. This enables surgeons to operate in tight spaces during advanced laparoscopic procedures, and to reach tissues in their natural anatomical position rather than pulling or manipulating tissue into the suturing device. Newer technologies in laparoscopic surgery, such as the Endo Stitch and SILS Stitch, may allow gynecologic surgeons to expand their surgical repertoire of advanced laparoscopic procedures.","983":"The ideal mesh suited for intraperitoneal placement should address both requirements of tissue separation on the visceral surface and tissue integration on the parietal surface. Meshes with bioresorbable coatings have recently been demonstrated to be successful. In this article, the results are shown of a study with a new type of tissue-separating lightweight mesh with a bioresorbable coating (Physiomesh; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. In this single-center retrospective analysis, 88 patients (50 men, 38 women) undergoing hernia surgery between November 16, 2010 and August 10, 2012 at the Imelda Hospital Bonheiden were included. Patients were asked to score their pre- and postoperative pain (1 month after surgery) on a visual analogue scale (VAS), as well as the chronic postoperative pain (pain at more than 6 months after surgery). The time period after which patients were pain free and after which they could return to work was also noted. Our results demonstrate that Physiomesh is a good alternative to the existing meshes leading to significant pain reduction, early return to work, acceptable complications, and low recurrence and reintervention rates.","984":"To introduce a new telesurgical concept and system, we describe the TELELAP Alf-X system and report the results of the preliminary laboratory experiments on dry lab skill exercises. The TELELAP Alf-X system offers a novel approach to remotely operated 3-dimension endoscopy by adding haptic sensation, an eye-tracking system, and a high degree of configuration versatility. The Alf-X system consists of a remote control unit, manipulator arms, connection node, and reusable endoscopic instruments. To test the hand-eye coordination, manual dexterity, depth offield, and ability to make optimal sutures and knots, the Alf-X system was used in a laparoscopic trainer utilizing specific tools by a single surgeon (SG) who repeated three different exercises ten times. The time and accuracy of the exercises were recorded. By using the TELELAP Alf-X system, the surgeon was able to work repeatedly and to perform all the exercises scheduled. In all exercises, the best results were achieved after the first five cases. The TELELAP Alf-X system shows excellent stability, easy-to-use interface, and ability to perform essential endoscopic skills. Further experimentation, especially in live tissue, could identify the role of this new technology for the surgical repertoire. ","985":"There are few options for the treatment of fistulas, leaks, and perforations endoscopically. Here we describe our experience with an endoscopic clipping system. A retrospective review of all cases using the Over-The-Scope-Clip system (Ovesco Endoscopy AG, Tuebingen, Germany) was performed. The system was utilized in ten patients with gastrointestinal surgical complications. Four patients had gastric leaks following sleeve gastrectomy, one had a post-operative colonic leak, two had gastro-gastric fistulas following gastric bypass, and three had esophageal perforations. Two leak patients had complete resolution, one had a contained leak following clip placement that was clinically insignificant, and the fourth patient had a persistent leak despite two clipping procedures. Two patients had gastro-gastric fistulas following roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery and, while they both had initial success, the fistulas recurred. One patient presented with anastomotic leak following colon resection but the system was unable to reach the treatment site. Three patients were successfully treated for esophageal perforation. There were no complications. This over-the-scope endoscopic clip system is simple to use, safe, and successful in approximating tissue to treat traditionally difficult surgical complications. Further experience and longer follow-up are needed to assess its indications as related to defect size and location.","986":"Since the introduction of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, there has been an ongoing dispute over the optimal method of fixating the mesh against the abdominal wall. In general, one could say that the more penetrating the fixation used, the stronger the fixation, but at the cost of increased acute postoperative pain. The occurrence of chronic pain in some patients has led to the search for less permanent penetrating fixation, but without risking a less stable mesh fixation and increased recurrences due to shift or shrinkage of the mesh. Avoiding transfascial sutures by using a double crown of staples has been proposed and recently absorbable fixation devices have been developed. Some surgeons have proposed fixation with glue to reduce the number of staples, or even eliminate them entirely. The continuously increasing multitude of marketed meshes and fixating devices leads to unlimited options in mesh fixation combination and geometry. Therefore, we will never be able to get a clear view on the benefits and pitfalls of every specific combination. Clearance of the anterior abdominal wall from peritoneal fatty tissue and correct positioning of the mesh with ample overlap of the hernia defect are possibly as important as the choice of mesh and fixation. Other topics that are involved in successful outcomes but not addressed in this article are adequate training in the procedure, appropriate selection of patients, and careful adhesiolysis to minimize accidental visceral injuries.","987":"Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF), commonly caused by prolonged obstructed labor, is one of the worst complications of childbirth and poor obstetric care in the developing world. We investigated the clinical efficacy and outcome of technical modifications of the current transperitoneal supravesical technique for supratrigonal and complex vesicovaginal fistula. We studied a total of 20 patients with iatrogenic supratrigonal and complex vesicovaginal fistula following obstetric trauma and hysterectomy. All patients underwent a modified transabdominal technique: the modifications consisted of passing a Foley catheter through the fistulous opening, inflating the balloon, and applying traction on the catheter to provide effective anchorage and to minimize the oozing from the cystotomy edges. The cystotomy was directed in the parasagittal line, and medial side of the bladder was rotated as a flap into the bladder defect; the urethral de Pezzare catheter was used for urinary drainage. We used hemostatic matrix sealant (FloSeal, Baxter BioSurgery, Westlake Village, California) to promote healing and hemostasis. The vesicovaginal fistula was successfully corrected in all patients after the first attempt, and no significant bladder dysfunction or decrease in bladder capacity was seen after repair. Interposition flaps were used in all patients, and six patients (30%) required ancillary procedures for other associated anomalies at the time of fistula repair. At a mean follow-up of two years, fourteen women were sexually active, and 5 (35%) from this group of patients complained of mild-to-moderate dyspareunia. In our study, supratrigonal VVFs were repaired with a transabdominal, transperitoneal, transvesical approach. Tailoring the cystotomy in a parasagittal line permitted closure of fistula by rotation of bladder flap into the defect. This excellent method should be a viable option when repairing complex VVF.","988":"Tension-free suburethral tapes have revolutionized the surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). These tapes are inserted by way of a retropubic or transobturator route. The inside-out tension-free vaginal tape transobturator approach, or TVT-Obturator system (TVT-O, Ethicon Women's Health and Urology, Somerville, NJ), was developed ten years ago with the aim of minimizing the risk of urinary tract injuries associated with retropubic and outside-in transobturator tapes while reproducibly ensuring minimal tissue dissection. Cadaveric studies have shown that the anatomical trajectory of the TVT-O tape is strictly perineal and courses away from neighboring obturator and pudendal neurovascular structures. Several meta-analyses have shown similar SUI cure rates after retropubic and transobturator tape procedures. Yet, the transobturator route may be associated with less voiding dysfunction, blood loss, bladder perforation, and shorter operating time. The original TVT-O procedure was modified with the aim of reducing the incidence of postoperative groin pain as well as the rather theoretical risk of obturator nerve injury. This modified procedure, named TVT-ABBREVO (Ethicon Women's Health and Urology, Somerville, NJ), utilizes a shortened, 12-cm-long polypropylene tape. In addition, perforation of the obturator membrane with the scissors and guide is avoided in order to reduce the depth of lateral dissection, and consequently, to maximize securing of the tape within the obturator muscular\/aponeurotic structures. In a comparative anatomical study, it was indeed observed that the shorter tape traversed less muscular structures (with no or only a minimal amount of tape lying in the adductor muscles) than its original counterpart, while still consistently anchoring in the obturator membrane at a similarly safe distance from the obturator canal. In a single-center randomized clinical trial, after a 3-year minimum follow-up, the modified TVT-O procedure with a shorter tape and reduced dissection was found to be as safe and efficient as the primal procedure for treating female SUI, with less severe and frequent groin pain in the immediate postoperative period.","989":"The new objective in primary hernia surgery should be the reduction of disabling chronic pain. This article will discuss the safety, efficacy, and reduction of pain of a sutureless glue mesh procedure for primary uncomplicated inguinal hernia repair. We began performing sutureless glue mesh repairs in 2004 for primary uncomplicated inguinal hernias with good results. After reduction of the hernia sac, polypropylene medium-weight preshaped flat mesh is fixed to the posterior inguinal wall with 0.5 mL of fibrin glue on the pubic tubercle; another 1.5 mL is sprayed on the entire mesh surface. The cord is positioned in subcutaneous space. The TI.ME.LI (Tissucol\/Tisseel for MEsh fixation in LIchtenstein hernia repair) trial was planned and conducted based on this experience. In two years, we treated more than 600 primary inguinal hernias with fibrin glue mesh fixation repair. At follow-up (2 to 96 months after surgery), no patients presented with severe pain, 2.7% of patients complained of moderate pain. Fibrin sealant for mesh fixation in open repair is well tolerated and it should be considered as a first-line option for mesh fixation in open inguinal hernia repair. ","990":"Because total knee arthroplasty is one of the most common orthopaedic procedures, it is important that the medical community continually strive for cost reductions. This prospective controlled trial aimed to determine if cost decreases could be achieved in non-navigated and navigated procedures by replacing traditional saws, cutting blocks, and trials with a specialized single-use system. Costs were lowered by an estimated $140.00-220.00 per surgery as a result of fewer instrument trays being reprocessed, and an estimated $75.00-330.00 per instrument case due to a 10-24-minute time savings during tray rewrapping. This study has positive financial implications for patients, hospitals, institutions, and third-party carriers.","991":"Initial stability with press-fit cups can be achieved in a number of ways based on the design of the cup. With line-to-line fit, screws fixation, press-fit of 1 to 2 mm which is obtained by an oversized hemispherical cup, initial stability can be achieved with the dual-radius press-fit cups, which have an equatorial diameter 1 to 2 mm greater than that of the polar diameter, to ensure a good press-fit and to provide adequate initial stability for bone ingrowth to occur reliably. Between January 2002 and January 2008, 400 total hip replacements (THRs) were carried out. We examined the first 150 consecutive primary THRs. In all hips, the acetabular component was the dual radius Trident AD shell (Stryker Orthopaedics, Mahwah, New Jersey). The median duration of follow-up was 6,2 yrs (range, 5 to 7 yrs). The median post-operative Harris Hip Score for 150 hips was 90.5 (range, 51 to 98). At the time of the latest follow-up, there was a bony incorporation of all components; we found no definite evidence of radiographic loosening and no signs of radiolucency. According to the encouraging results of the present study we conclude that the Trident cup is a valid choice for acetabular replacement. ","992":"The aim of this study was to evaluate prospective patients with periarticular fractures where a meta physeal bone defect was grafted with high compressive calcium sulfate cement. The calcium sulfate cement MIIG X3, (Wright Medical Technology, Inc, Arlington, TN) was used in 45 patients with periarticular fractures--distal radial, tibial plateau, humeral head, and calcaneal fractures--to fill the metaphyseal defect. All fractures were treated either with open or closed reduction, fracture fixation, and the cement was applied openly or closed. Radiographs were evaluated for fracture reduction, joint line gap, and step, as well as for rate of graft replacement by bone. All fractures united without an additional procedure. There were no wound infections or other complications attributed to the graft. At three-month follow-up, a complete graft replacement by bone was observed in all fractures. Joint line step was not developed in any patient, but a joint line gap of 3 mm was observed postoperatively in one patient with a tibial plateau fracture. Loss of reduction occurred in one patient with an extra-articular distal radial fracture treated with closed reduction and k-wire fixation. Cement that escaped into the joint or the surrounding soft tissues was not visible at the six-week follow-up. In conclusion, the results of this study confirm the safety and the efficacy of this cement when it is used as graft with the appropriate fixation method in traumatic metaphyseal bone defects.","993":"New products have led the way in advancements of inguinal hernia repair. None is more impressive than the evolution of the plug patch. In 1968 Irving Lichtenstein introduced the first Marlex mesh plug repair when he rolled a piece of flat polypropylene into the shape of a cigarette to fill a femoral defect. He later expanded his use of the \"cigarette plug\" to repair recurrent hernias. Today, a wide array of mesh plugs, ranging from nonabsorbable to partially and fully absorbable biomaterials, are available from manufacturers. While some surgeons have used the plug alone for repair, most believe the overlay patch is of greater importance for the durability of the repair. With larger overlays, it is questionable whether a plug should be a permanent, nonabsorbable material. Heavyweight plugs have been reported to erode, migrate, or cause vocational-limiting inguinodynia. Using a fully absorbable plug in inguinal hernia repair minimizes the risk of these complications. This article focuses on the technical refinements associated with using the completely absorbable GORE BIO-A Hernia Plug (W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc, Elkton, MD) in combination with macroporous polypropylene or polyester. Additionally, this paper describes the use of GORE BIO-A Tissue Reinforcement as an alternative for repair following removal of prior polypropylene plug-patch herniorrhaphy that cause inguinodynia.","994":"Inguinal hernia repair remains controversial, despite advances in technique and materials. Conventional implants are typically static (passive) and do not move in concert with the groin's motility. Inguinal hernia repair with mesh fixation on dynamic groin structures are not tension free, and are associated with tissue tearing, bleeding, hematoma, and nerve entrapment--all which might contribute to mesh dislocation. The poor quality of tissue ingrowth within static meshes\/plugs embodies another crucial issue in prosthetic hernia repair. Because the prosthetics used for inguinal hernia repair are incorporated by rigid fibrotic tissue (hence the term \"scar plate\"), the regressive tissue leads to shrinkage and reduction of the mesh surface area--a significant cause of recurrence and discomfort. To improve inguinal hernia repair, a new 3D dynamic (inherent recoil), self-retaining implant has been developed. It achieved excellent outcomes in the porcine model, and demonstrated that the dynamic compliant movement and recoil of the 3D prosthetic structure within the groin's natural tissues allowed for the critical cyclical physiologic loading that is missing with other implants. Because enhanced biologic response and improved quality of tissue ingrowth result from its dynamic interactions with groin tissue, the shrinkage of the implant is nearly absent, even after long-term implantation. We discuss this dynamic hernia repair concept in this report. The use of this new 3D implant represented a faster and simpler surgical approach to inguinal hernia repair. The procedure was based on the centrifugal expansion of the device, whose design features converted ejection forces into gripping forces, and avoided the need for suturing the implant (eliminating a cause of complications related to prosthesis fixation).","995":"Mesenchymal stem cells may differentiate into angiogenic and osteoprogenitor cells. The effectiveness of autologous pluripotent mesenchymal cells for treating bone defects has not been investigated in humans. We present a case series to evaluate the rationale of using nucleated cells from autologous bone marrow aspirates in the treatment of severe bone defects that failed to respond to traditional treatments. Ten adult patients (mean age, 49.6-years-old) with severe bone defects were included in this study. Lower limb bone defects were &gt;or=5 cm3 in size, and upper limb defects .or=2 cm3. Before surgery, patients were tested for antibodies to common pathogens. Treatment consisted of bone allogeneic scaffold enriched with bone marrow nucleated cells harvested from the iliac crest and concentrated using an FDA-approved device. Postsurgery clinical and radiographic follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. To assess viability, morphology, and immunophenotype, bone marrow nucleated cells were cultured in vitro, tested for sterility, and assayed for the possible replication of adventitious (contaminating) viruses. In 9 of 10 patients, both clinical and radiographic healing of the bone defect along with bone graft integration were observed (mean time, 5.6 months); one patient failed to respond. No post-operative complications were observed. Bone marrow nucleated cells were enriched 4.49-fold by a single concentration step, and these enriched cells were free of microbial contamination. The immunophenotype of adherent cells was compatible with that of mesenchymal stem cells. We detected the replication of Epstein-Barr virus in 2\/10 bone marrow cell cultures tested. Hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, and endogenous retrovirus HERV-K replication were not detected. Overall, 470 to 1,150 million nucleated cells were grafted into each patient. This case series, with a mean follow-up of almost 2 years, demonstrates that an allogeneic bone scaffold enriched with concentrated autologous bone marrow cells obtained from the iliac crest provides orthopedic surgeons a novel option for treating important bone defects that are unresponsive to traditional therapies.","996":"Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is the gold standard procedure for weight loss surgery and is the most commonly performed bariatric operation in the United States. Laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGBP) has become the predominantly used technique for weight loss surgery since 2004. The aim of this study was to compare surgical outcomes of LGBP versus open gastric bypass (OGBP) for the treatment of morbid obesity. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database, clinical data of morbidly obese patients who underwent LGBP or OGBP from 2006 to 2008 were analyzed. Outcome measures included patient characteristics, comorbidities, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay (LOS), hospital charges, and in-hospital mortality. A total of 226,043 morbidly obese patients underwent gastric bypass during the three-year period (LGBP: 183,452 [81.16%], OGBP: 42,591[18.84%]). The majority of patients in both groups were female (LGBP: 81.0% vs. OGBP: 78.5%, p &lt; 0.01) and Caucasian (LGBP: 73.9% vs. OGBP: 72.6%, p &lt; 0.01). Most comorbidities were significantly higher in the OGBP group. All specific postoperative complications were significantly higher in the OGBP group (urinary tract infection [UTI], pneumonia, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, ileus, gastrointestinal leak, wound infection, and bowel obstruction). LGBP was associated with lower overall postoperative complications (3.5% vs. 10.8%; p &lt; 0.01), shorter LOS (2.4 days vs. 4.2 days; p &lt; 0.01), lower mortality (0.06 vs. 0.52; p &lt; 0.01), and lower hospital costs ($39,570 vs. $45,629; p &lt; 0.01) compared with the OGBP. LGBP was associated with shorter LOS, lower morbidity, lower mortality, and lower hospital costs compared with those of OGBP. The laparoscopic approach to gastric bypass should be considered the gold standard approach for the treatment of morbid obesity. ","997":"Serious complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) include pseudoaneurysm formation andABSTRACT rupture accompanying pancreatic fistula, and pancreatojejunostomy leakage, which is commonly associated with mortality or liver failure. We report a case of the successful treatment of pseudoaneurysm rupture after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) by covered stent placement. A 70-year-old man underwent PPPD for ampullary carcinoma. After the procedure, a pancreatic fistula was detected, and suction drainage was continued. The patient was discharged on the twenty-first post-operative day. On the same day, arterial bleeding was detected from the pancreatojejunostomy drain, and emergency abdominal angiography showed a pseudoaneurysm of 3-cm diameter at the proper hepatic artery (PHA). Multiple embolization coils were placed in a pseudoaneurysm. However, bleeding still continued, so hemostasis with coils was considered unfeasible. The next strategy was to place a covered stent, but the PHA was thick; thus, a biliary covered stent was implanted. Angiographic examination subsequently revealed that hepatic arterial flow was maintained, and there were no aneurysms. However, a few days later, a coil that had migrated into a peripheral branch of the right hepatic artery caused multiple hepatic abscesses, and percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage was performed before the patient was discharged. Although coils were initially sufficient for hemostasis, repeatedly recurrent bleeding led to the consideration of a covered stent.","998":"Hip resurfacing is a popular procedure among patients and surgeons. The principal concepts of hip resurfacing are simple, yet demanding, as the procedure has limited tolerance to placement errors, especially for the femoral component. In current technical manuals, the placement of a guide wire seated in the neck is crucial. This guide wire is usually applied by the use of jigs that are intended to align to the neck axis. After evaluating the position of the guide wire, it is necessary to reposition it in many cases. We propose the use of a specially designed readjustment jig that takes advantage of the first guide wire, and gives defined offset and angulations for the placement of a second guide wire. A simple set of disks with different offsets and angulations in relation to a central hole has been developed to serve as a tool to readjust the positioning of the central guide wire in hip resurfacing.","999":"Although it is currently the gold standard for the treatment of primary and secondary coxarthrosis, total hip arthroplasty is associated with long-time complications, primarily, polyethylene liner wear, and production of debris that lead to peri-prosthetic osteolysis and resultant aseptic mobilization. (The definition of these osteolytic areas is based on a radiographic classification first described by DeLee and Charnley in 1976.) We introduce a new radiographic classification method, based on the well-known measuring software Roman v.170 (Cook e Poullain [2002-2005, Institute of Orthopaedics, Oswestry, U.K.]) that is designed to quantify radiologic parameters. Two case studies are also described. This original method can be easily employed, and returns a precise angular classification of the position of the osteolytic area and a computerized calculation of the extent of the osteolytic lesion.","1000":"Metal-on-metal bearings have had popularity that has waxed and waned over the years. The advantages realized relative to wear resistance and strength had been offset by early failures, manufacturing difficulty, and most recently by adverse soft tissue responses to the metallic debris. The bearing's history, evolution, advantages and disadvantages will be discussed in attempt to answer the question: is metal-on-metal a passing fancy?","1001":"Osteoporosis is a major global health problem, with over 10 million people currently diagnosed with the disease. Although 80% of osteoporotic patients are women, a considerable number of men are also affected. Also, due to increasing life expectancy, the number of elderly patients with osteoporosis affected by degenerative and traumatic spinal diseases will increase further. Osteoporosis reduces bone quality through negative bone remodelling. Low bone quality can reduce the pull-out strength of pedicle screw, and negative bone remodelling can cause delayed bone fusion. However, pedicle screw instrumentation of the osteoporotic spine carries an increased risk of screw loosening, pull-out, and fixation failure. Our preliminary study aims to investigate the efficiency of expandable pedicle screws (OsseoScrew-Spinal Fixation System, Alphatec Spine Inc., Carlsbad, CA) in osteoporotic spinal patients. All osteoporotic patients with degenerative and traumatic spinal diseases admitted in our department underwent a pre-operative spinal x-Ray and MRI or CT. Pre-operative clinical assesment of patients was based on the visual analog scale (VAS) and Owestry Disability (ODI) questionnaire-a disease-specific outcome measure. Ten osteoporotic patients were treated with expandable pedicle screws (OsseoScrew). Post-operative clinical assessment of patients was based on the VAS and ODI questionnaire at 3 months and 1 year of follow-up. Post-operative radiologic follow-up was performed after 3 days (CT, x-ray); 3 months (x-ray); 6 months (spinal CT); and 1 year (spinal CT). Expandable pedicle screws improved pull-out strength as compared to standard pedicle screws in osteoporotic patients with degenerative and traumatic spinal diseases.","1002":"In orthopaedic surgery, surgical site contamination leading to periprosthetic infections is a major concern with important morbidity, financial and emotional burden. Single-use instruments developed for total knee arthroplasties are intended to simplify the surgical procedure, decrease the number of surgical trays that require sterilization and reprocessing, decrease the incidence of possible contamination through breaks in surgical wraps, and improve operating room efficiency. As the demand for total knee arthroplasty continues to rise, a greater burden on the healthcare system may be created. The use of single-use instruments, cutting guides, and trials will play an increasing role in total knee arthroplasty through improved operating room efficiency.","1003":"In the properly selected patient, alternative options to total knee arthroplasty exist for the surgical treatment of knee joint disease. These procedures involve reestablishing healthy cartilage (i.e., bone marrow stimulation, grafting, autologous chondrocyte implantation), mechanical axis correction (i.e., osteotomy), and\/or replacing pathologic knee compartments with prosthetic devices (i.e., unicompartmental and bicompartmental knee arthroplasty). Treatment modality selection varies based on a number of factors, including but not limited to age, activity level, treatment history, and lesion size, location, severity, and etiology. Reestablishing healthy cartilage in pathologic knees is dependent on the recipient's capacity and propensity to heal and regenerate new cartilage. Therefore, this technique is typically conducted in young patients, with small- to medium-sized focal chondral or osteochondral lesions. Osteotomy, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, and bicompartmental knee arthroplasty do not have the same restrictions and are used for patients with larger, isolated knee lesions. This article reviews indications, efficacy, and advancements of existing surgical techniques for the repair or restoration of knee lesion injuries.","1004":"Pain is an unpleasant sensory experience that evokes negative emotions and erodes an individual's quality of life, constituting a significant amount of stress. Chronic-wound patients have described pain as most intense during dressing change and the worst part of living with an ulcer. Wound-related pain is complex, involving a multitude of physiologic and psychologic factors, such as emotional state, culture, personality, meaning, and expectation. Although the exact mechanism(s) remains elusive, a burgeoning body of evidence suggests a close link between stress\/anxiety and pain. Wound healing can be compromised by overproduction of cortisol compromising the function of immune system in addition to catecholamines causing vasoconstriction and poor tissue oxygenation. The purpose of this paper is to review the relationships among pain, stress, and wound healing.","1005":"Postoperative pain is a major obstacle in hernia repair surgery, and the choice of clinically efficacious surgical technique should also result in the least postoperative pain and patients' quality of life (QoL). The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare two surgical techniques for open inguinal hernia repair by assessing the patients' QoL. Men (18-to-75 years old) with primary unilateral inguinal hernia underwent Mesh Plug (MP; n = 156; Bard (PerFix Plug, CR Bard Inc, Murray Hill, NJ) and Shouldice (S; n = 144) techniques. We evaluated: 1) Intensity of postoperative pain (visual analog scale [VAS]) and 2) quality of life (QoL; Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 [SF-36]). Patients undergoing MP had significantly lower VAS scores on postoperative days (POD) 1 (22.1 vs 27.4, p = .003) and 2 (13.2 vs 21.4, p &lt; .0001) compared to those in the S group. The QoL was also improved in patients undergoing MP on PODs 8 and 45. Total duration of operation, length of hospital stay, and cessation of normal activities were significantly shorter in the MP group. Compared to the S technique, the MP technique results in significantly less postoperative pain and improved QoL.","1006":"During total hip arthroplasty, the biomechanics of the joint may be altered by removal of bone and by a change in the center of rotation of the joint. Joint pathologies existing at the time of reconstruction may also affect post-operative joint motion. In order to achieve optimized biomechanics of the replaced joint, it is important to understand the muscle actions that are involved in joint movement and the forces that are imposed on the construct by patient activity. To ensure survivorship of the replacement, intraoperative and long-term stability of the components making up the joint within host bone must be achieved. The patients receiving total hip replacements in the twenty first century tend to be younger, heavier, more active and longer lived than the patients who first received hip implants. Thus, biomechanical decisions are becoming even more important for long-term survivorship of the reconstruction.","1007":"Laparoscopic hepatic surgery has only recently become an established field. Technological limitations in devices used to transect the liver parenchyma and control hemostasis have been a rate limiting step. However, as a result of advances in products specifically tailored to liver surgery, there has been steady progress in the complexity of laparoscopic hepatectomies performed, from the minimally invasive fenestration of liver cysts, to peripheral wedge resections, major hepatectomy, and recently donor hepatectomy. Herein, we discuss the role of several laparoscopic devices which include the endoscopic stapler, pre-coagulators, ultrasonic dissector, ultrasonic shears, and vessel sealing devices. Laparoscopic liver surgery introduces new challenges to even the experienced surgeon. It is important to have a solid understanding of the advantages and limitations of available instruments in order to safely and effectively expand the use of laparoscopy in hepatic surgery. ","1008":"Adequate hemostasis in cranial and spinal surgery is of paramount importance in a neurosurgeon's daily practice. Generalized ooze bleeding from the surgical wall cavities, coming from the dura mater or nervous tissue may be troublesome and may limit visualization in minimally invasive neurosurgery. Hemostatic matrix is a mixture of a flowable gelatin matrix (bovine or porcine) and a thrombin component mixed together. A total of 318 patients undergoing cranial, craniospinal, and spinal procedure with the use of gelatin hemostatic matrix (Floseal and Surgiflo) were enrolled in this clinical study. We compared the different hemostatic techniques using the gelatin hemostatic matrix, and investigated indications, time to bleeding control, and its efficacy and safety in neurosurgery.","1009":"Advances in surgical technique and implant design have increased the treatment options available to joint reconstruction surgeons. New technologies for component alignment such as custom cutting blocks and disposable cutting blocks hold the potential for more anatomic component positioning and less instrument turnover which may decrease infection rates. Improved component alignment may also be obtained with the use of computer-assisted surgery. Utilization of bone-sparing designs such as patellofemoral, unicompartmental, and bicompartmental knee arthroplasty allow for the surgeon to customize treatment based on patient symptoms by addressing each compartment individually. Gender-specific designs may be useful in the setting of populations which deviate from standard dimensions that are available in traditional unisex designs. New higher-conforming bearing designs such as rotating platform bearings allow for more natural knee kinematics, while also limiting polyethylene wear by decreasing contact stress. Newer interfaces for cementless fixation utilizing porous coated surfaces allows for biologic component fixation which has the potential to increase interface durability and implant survivorship. These new materials, designs, and techniques are challenging the traditional \"gold standard\" cemented total knee arthroplasty and have the potential for developing a more durable and naturally feeling prosthetic knee. Further study is required to identify which patients are most appropriate for each new technology.","1010":"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most successful orthopaedic procedures with 10 to 20 year survivorships from multiple studies of greater than 95%. These success rates typically apply to patients over 70 years of age who may only want to return to activities of daily living. However, recently there is a demand by both senior citizens as well as young patients to have TKAs that return them to high activity levels and occasionally high performance sports. In this review, we will describe bicruciate retaining prostheses, including knowledge of their kinematics from fluoroscopic and gait studies, results of clinical studies, a summary of their potential advantages and disadvantages, anterior cruciate ligament viability at time of arthroplasty, considerations for implantation of these devices, and their role in the future of total knee arthroplasty.","1011":"The patho-anatomy in an aging spine is partly defined by Rauschning's anatomic cryosections. Theories of pain generation and principles of minimally invasive spine surgery are suggested by close examination of these specimens. If the visualized patho-anatomy can be studied in vivo in a partially sedated patient by spinal probing, spinal pain can be better understood, and rational endoscopic treatment options may then evolve.1 A 1997 IRB-approved study provided evidence that endoscopic transforaminal surgery was feasible for the treatment of a wide spectrum of degenerative conditions in the lumbar spine. The technique incorporated evocative chromo-discography to correlate reproduction of pain with in-vivo probing of patho-anatomy. Laser and radiofrequency ablation augmented mechanical decompression to obtain pain relief.1-3 Endoscopic visualization of patho-anatomy ranging from annular tears to spondylolisthesis and stenosis provided clinical evidence that foraminal decompression, ablation, and irrigation could effectively treat these visualized painful conditions with minimal morbidity. This resulted in a better understanding of the pain generators in the lumbar spine, opening up options for surgical pain management.1-5 The procedure does not burn any bridges for more traditional surgical techniques. The learning curve may be steep for some and long for others, but results are very good, concomitant with each individual surgeon overcoming his personal learning curve. ","1012":"Degenerative constrictions of the spinal canal with compression of neural elements arise as a result of bony, disk, capsular, or ligament structures. The most frequent causes are disk herniations and spinal stenoses. The lumbar and cervical spine is the most prominent cause. After conservative treatments have been exhausted, surgical intervention may be necessary. Today, microsurgical, microscopically assisted decompression is regarded as the standard procedure for disk herniation and spinal stenosis in the lumbar region, while in the cervical spine microsurgical, microscopically assisted anterior decompression and fusion are standard. Both procedures demonstrate good clinical results but present problems associated with the operation. Decompressions in the area of the spine must be carried out under continuous visualization and must entail the possibility of adequate bone resection. Taking this into account, completely new endoscopes and instrument sets were developed for full-endoscopic operations in tandem with the development of the lateral transforaminal and interlaminar approaches for the lumbar spine and the posterior and contralateral anterior approaches for the cervical spine. The possibilities and results of comparable, established standard procedures were used as a benchmark in the course of clinical validation. The development of surgically created approaches and the new rod lens endoscopes combined with appropriate instrument sets have laid the technical foundations for full-endoscopic operation in the lumbar spine on all primary and recurrent disk herniations inside and outside the spinal canal and on spinal stenoses. This development has also permitted resection of soft disk herniations in the cervical spine. The use of the relevant approaches depends on anatomical and pathological inclusion and exclusion criteria. The clinical results of standard procedures are achieved, which must be regarded as a minimum criterion for the introduction of new technologies. On the basis of EBM criteria, it can be established that using the full-endoscopic techniques developed, adequate decompression is achieved in the defined indications with reduced traumatization, improved visibility conditions, and positive cost benefits. Today, full-endoscopic operations may be regarded as an expansion and alternative within the overall concept of spinal surgery. ","1013":"Ongoing technological development combined with better understanding of endoscopic anatomy has made posterolateral endoscopic discectomy an appealing surgical option for the management of herniated lumbar disc. We evaluated clinical outcomes, complication rates, and surgical learning curve with the percutaneous posterolateral transforaminal endoscopic discectomy technique (PPTED). PPTED was performed on 150 patients from 2004 to 2008. And 124 patients were available for follow-up. Data regarding pain, postoperative complications, neurological status, operation time, and subjective patient satisfaction were recorded. A satisfactory clinical outcome as reflected in the VAS (mean 3.6) and ODI improvement (mean 21%) scores was reported; 20.9% of the patients required additional surgery. Learning curve assessment showed a significant difference (p = 0.043) for fewer revision surgeries as surgeons became more experienced. Patients who had endoscopic discectomy as a primary surgery achieved significantly lower VAS (p = 0.04) and ODI improvement (p = 0.004) scores compared with patients having transforaminal endoscopic discectomy as revision surgery. The complication rate was 1.6%, including one case of post-surgery hypoesthesia and one deep wound infection. The percutaneous posterolateral transforaminal endoscopic discectomy technique has a satisfactory clinical outcome with a low complication rate. Results for endoscopic surgery for revision or recurrent disc herniation are comparable to those of open revision surgery; the steep learning curve can be overcome with training and suitable patient selection. ","1014":null,"1015":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with increased risk for medical complications following total joint arthroplasty. Our institution employs postoperative precautions for OSA patients in an effort to minimize the impact of postoperative complications in this group. We performed this study to assess the effect of careful monitoring on postoperative complication rates in OSA patients. We identified patients with a clinically suspected or objective diagnosis of OSA who received total joint arthroplasty between January 1998 and January 2008. 1016 cases in 792 OSA patients were matched to 1016 cases in 993 control patients to compare complication rates. There were no differences between OSA and control patients in cardiovascular and respiratory complications following TJA. Patients with OSA experienced increased rates of postoperative acute renal failure when compared with controls (p = 0.02) and experienced mild desaturations (Hb O2 &lt; 92%) (p = 0.002), but not severe desaturations (Hb O2 &lt; 88%) (p = 0.2). We conclude that our postoperative monitoring protocols are successful in reducing postoperative complications most commonly associated with OSA. We were interested to note the increased risk for OSA patients to develop postoperative acute renal failure and believe that future study is warranted to explore the link between OSA and renal failure. ","1016":"Controversy exists regarding the ability to position the implants reliably in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study compared the ability to accurately position components in the MIS two-incision versus single-incision approaches. Twenty-four patients were randomized to THA through one of three approaches, including the two-incision approach. Component position was measured with computed tomography. The mean deviation from the target acetabular anteversion was 14.8 degrees in the two-incision MIS group versus 6.4 degrees in the other two approaches (p = 0.006). A mean of 9.8 degrees deviation from the target femoral anteversion in the two-incision MIS approach group was observed compared with 5.3 degrees in the single-incision groups (p = 0.05). These results suggest there is a decreased ability to accurately position the components in the two-incision approach. ","1017":"Modularity is defined as separation of a system into independent parts or modules that can be treated as logical and may be separated and recombined. Historically, the modularity represents the evolution of the concept of \"low friction arthroplasty\" developed by Sir J. Charnely in 1960. The disadvantage of a one-piece stem is the difficulty of restoring the biomechanical feature of the hip. Thus, the natural evolution was the introduction of modularity on both sides, the acetabulum and the femur. Modularity allows the surgeon to accurately match the anatomic characteristics of each patient to obtain improved range of motion, joint stability, abductor strength, and leg length equality. Disadvantages are related to the introduction of different interfaces, which could be sites of wear and corrosion. In accordance with the most recent literature, in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) the modularity can be reduced to the head and the acetabular component, while a one-piece stem can manage the majority of cases. On the other hand, we believe that during revision surgery, a complete modularity is necessary. ","1018":"Substantial progress has been achieved in cementless arthroplasty in the recent decades where cementless arthroplasty has evolved from pressfit implantation to porous-coated and later HA-coated implant fixation as its ultimate current state-of-the-art incarnation. Key factors for success are adequate primary stability of the device in the bone supported by design and surface structure variables that together with optimal implant biocompatibility result in durable osseo-integration of the device. Excellent survival rates past 20 years are documented in both literature and registries with quantitative studies confirming the excellent implant stability and bone quality. Elderly, younger, or medically compromised patients may require specific attention to avoid problems, but in general, every patient can be given the benefit of modern cementless hip arthroplasty. With an optimal consideration for patient-related factors as well as anatomic reconstruction of the arthroplasty, modern cementless arthroplasty provides every patient an outlook on both excellent long-term functionality and survival. ","1019":"This report includes a series of eight cases in which a dual-mobility prosthesis was utilized for difficult acetabular reconstructive hip arthroplasty cases. Most of the patients described had multiple reasons for hip instability (including prior multiple surgeries, abductor muscle insufficiency, prior infection). All patients were successfully managed with this device and this report includes a brief description of its use compared with other surgical reconstruction methods for instability. ","1020":"Dislocation after total hip arthroplasty remains a primary concern among orthopaedic surgeons. Endeavors to decrease the incidence of dislocation, while maintaining limb function and mobility, have been painstakingly undertaken. Since their advent in the 1970s, dual mobility cups have proven again and again to be effective in reducing dislocation following total hip arthroplasty. The dual mobility cup enables the surgeon to treat patients with an increased risk for dislocation, while maintaining hip stability, favorable wear properties, and an acceptable rate of dislocation. Disadvantages are related to the potential increased wear and surgeon error. With advances in engineering and design, dual mobility cups have proven useful in providing lower dislocation rates for several pathological conditions. As a result, dual mobility cups have moved into the forefront of total hip arthroplasty. ","1021":"In middle-aged patients, the choice between resurfacing and total hip arthroplasty may be difficult given recent studies showing differences in functional outcomes. Success of clinical outcomes, defined by a greater range of motion and reduced pain following surgery, are dependent on a return in function of incised muscle groups. To identify neuromuscular recovery following hip arthroplasty, hip abductor activity was assessed throughout the first year of recovery. Analysis focused on characterization of the temporal activity of the gluteus medius during activities of daily living. Adaptation in muscle firing and biomechanical outcomes was revealed in both groups, though more pronounced in the THA cohort with increasingly difficult activities. Differences between groups should be considered by clinicians when considering the best treatment options for their patients. ","1022":"Infection after total knee arthroplasty is a rare yet devastating complication requiring multiple hospitalizations, operations, and outpatient visits placing a significant burden on both patient and treating surgeon. Two-stage exchange protocols for the treatment of the chronically infected total knee arthroplasty remain the standard of care in the United States. Thorough debridement, use of antibiotic spacers, treatment with parenteral antibiotics, and delayed reimplantation have resulted in treatment success rates greater than 90%. The use of antibiotic cement spacers has led to increased range of motion, preservation of the joint space, and maintenance of cleaner soft tissue plains making surgery at the time of reimplantation less arduous. This article describes our current surgical technique used for two-stage revision of the chronically infected total knee including: (1) exposure, (2) implant removal and debridement, and (3) construction of both static and mobile antibiotic spacers. ","1023":"The purpose of this study is to determine whether operative time for primary total knee arthroplasty can be decreased with the use of a continuous barbed suture. Five hundred patients were retrospectively reviewed and divided into groups based on whether incision closure utilized a continuous barbed suture or an interrupted biodegradable suture. We identified additional variables to determine their relationship to operative time, including body mass index, age, gender, and side of replacement. The results demonstrated a decrease in operative time by an average of 4 minutes (P &lt; .001) with the use of barbed suture, without an associated increase in complications. Statistically significant relationships were found between operative time and variables such as body mass index, age, and gender, but not side of replacement. ","1024":"Cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasties have had high success rates. The purpose of this study was to compare a newer cruciate-retaining design to a previously used implant to determine if there were any changes in clinical or functional outcome. A total of 461 patients (553 knees) were identified who had total knee arthroplasty with this newer design. At latest 2-year follow-up, the mean range of motion was 121 degrees (range 105 to 140 degrees), the mean Knee Society pain score was 91 points (range, 57 to 100 points) and the functional score was 76 points (45 to 100 points). The comparison group of 211 patients (225 knees) had a mean range of motion of 119 degrees at 2 years (range, 90 to 142 degrees) with Knee Society pain and functional scores of 95 and 85 points, respectively (ranges 57 to 100, and 0 to 100, respectively). The use of the newer cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty showed comparable results to the previously used design at short-term follow-up. The cruciate-retaining design used in this study had no early failures, though further study is needed to make assessments regarding longer-term functional results and outcomes. ","1025":"Although tourniquet use is the standard protocol for total knee arthroplasties it may lead to postoperative complications including thigh pain, compressive soft-tissue problems, and thromboembolic events. The purpose of this study was to explore the perioperative and clinical outcomes of total knee arthroplasty performed without a tourniquet. Thirty consecutive total knee arthroplasties were performed in 30 patients without a tourniquet and compared with 30 procedures (30 matched patients) performed with a tourniquet. Tourniquet patients had statistically lower mean intraoperative blood loss, total blood loss, and change in hematocrit, but these did not have any clinical impact or change the transfusion rate between the groups. At a mean follow-up of 3 years, both groups achieved excellent mean Knee Society scores with similar improvements between groups. There were no complications or radiographic abnormalities in either group. Total knee arthroplasty performed with or without a tourniquet yields similar intraoperative surgical and postoperative clinical outcomes. ","1026":"Numerous reports have linked malaligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA) components with increased wear, poor functional outcomes, and possibly early failure due to component loosening. Consequently, proper alignment is critical to a successful outcome. This article will review: the normal mechanical alignment of the knee, classical alignment in TKA, anatomic alignment in TKA, intraoperative reference points for alignment, and the potential for new alignment schema based on the kinematic axes of knee movement. Along with our increased understanding of how the knee functions, modern total knee arthroplasty has evolved to restore a neutral mechanical axis when prostheses are implanted. Although historically the goal has been to aim to be within 3 degrees of this axis, recent reports have challenged the validity of the claim that outliers have an increased risk for revision. In addition, new alignment schemes have been developed based on the kinematic axes, but as yet we await verification of results to determine whether they increase the ability of total knee arthroplasty to provide a better-functioning and longer-lasting knee for the patient.

Though there are many beliefs as to the desires of the patient's postoperative expectations, scientific research is lacking. The current paper evaluates patients' preoperative perceptions and postoperative expectations of cosmetic vulvar surgery. This is a retrospective analysis of 550 patients who are considering labia minora reduction. Preoperative questionnaires that address patients' preoperative perceptions of their labia as well as their postoperative expectations were reviewed and analyzed. Mean age was 36 (range 12 to 65) and parity 1.52 (range 0 to 8). On examination, 99.5% (547\/550) of patients had labia minora protruding beyond the distal edge of the majora. Patients' postoperative desires included: 97.8% preferred the labia minora to be \"at\" or \"below\" the level of the labia majora compared with 2.2% preferring it to be \"at\" or \"just above\" the labia majora; 96.9% preferred \"pink\" edges compared with 3.1% desiring \"dark\" edges. Women presenting for vulvar cosmetic surgery have preoperative perceptions and postoperative expectations that should be considered with regard to surgery. Understanding a patient's postoperative labiaplasty expectations should be considered prior to engaging in surgery. Doing so could possibly alter the surgeon's labiaplasty technique and reduce the need for subsequent revision surgeries.

Therefore, surgeons across all specialties should be well equipped to approach a reoperative abdomen with minimal complications and satisfactory patient outcomes. Previous abdominal scarring and adhesions present distinct challenges for surgeons performing minimally invasive surgery, and postsurgical adhesions are considered one of the main reasons for conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy. In this review article, we present the influence of previous abdominal surgeries and pathogenesis of adhesion formation. Methods of laparoscopic entry and technical aspects of adhesiolysis to the ventral abdominal wall, intestinal, and pelvic adhesions are reviewed.

As BPD is a complex procedure with substantial morbidity and mortality, attempts were undertaken to split the procedure into two steps. SG became the first step in a staged BPD procedure assuming that this less-invasive operation would reduce the surgical risk in super obese patients. The second step - the duodenal switch - was thus postponed until after a major weight loss. Several studies have since been published showing data that, besides the successful weight loss, the procedure itself had a positive effect on obesity-associated comorbidities. Sleeve gastrectomy has gained widespread acceptance as a primary and definite bariatric procedure. SG has become an innovative tool in the battle against obesity. Although several variations of SG have been described, standardization is paramount for optimal results. Of particular interest are: the minimally invasive access, the dissection, preservation of the antrum, position of staple-line and buttress material, as well as the size of the bougie and the extent of fundal resection. This article describes the different procedural and technical aspects of the operation. In addition, it will line out how we transferred our skills and experience in single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) from cholecystectomy and sigmoid resection to sleeve gastrectomy.

The British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society represents an active bariatric clinical community and holds its own scientific meetings. High quality is fostered by a multidisciplinary and team approach in specialized units with adequate volume. Significant advances have been made in professional recognition, science, innovation, guideline development, and health-economic validation.

We herein report the first case of insulinoma of the pancreas treated by RPS. RPS enucleation was performed for a 23-year-old Japanese female who was admitted to our hospital with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia attributable to an insulinoma. The preoperative examinations confirmed the diagnosis of a solitary insulinoma of the pancreatic tail. Enucleation of the insulinoma using RPS was performed. A 2.5-cm umbilical incision was made, and three laparoscopic trocars were individually inserted into the abdominal cavity via this incision. Another 3-mm trocar was inserted from the left subcostal region. All procedures that were usually performed in conventional laparoscopic surgery were also performed by RPS: intraoperative ultrasonography, mobilization of the tail of the pancreas, enucleation of the tumor, and suturing of the stump. A mechanical manipulator, the Radius Surgical System (Radius), was used for suturing and ligation. The Radius was sufficient to overcome in-line viewing and hand\/instrument collisions, and enabled us to perform precise suturing and ligation. Serial blood sugar, C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR), and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) measurements revealed that all values were normal after resection. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. RPS was successfully applied for enucleation of a solitary mass in the tail of the pancreas, and represents an alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery. This method is technically feasible and results in superior cosmesis. The Radius facilitated advanced laparoscopic surgery and may also have advantages in RPS.

This study compares the incidence of breast seroma following mastectomy upon the use of ABC versus standard monopolar diathermy. This is a retrospective cohort study, with data collected from January 2006 to August 2008 for all patients who underwent a simple mastectomy and axillary surgery. Outcomes included incidence of seroma, amount of drainage on day of discharge, and timing of seroma formation. Fifty-six patients were studied, with 30 undergoing simple mastectomy using ABC diathermy and 25 using simple diathermy. The incidence of postoperative breast seroma development was 30% (n = 9) in the former group and 36% (n = 9) in the latter. In the ABC group, a high postoperative drainage at discharge was predictive of developing a seroma; this was not observed in the monopolar group. The search for methods to reduce the incidence of seroma in breast surgery is ongoing worldwide. Despite a previous report, this study failed to show any significant difference between ABC and monopolar diathermy in the incidence of breast seroma formation following simple mastectomy and axillary surgery. ABC diathermy is more costly, and its use needs to be carefully considered in an era of a stretched National Health Service financial budget. ","1040":"The resection in partial pancreatico-duodenectomy as the standard treatment for malignancies of the pancreatic head is commonly performed starting from the hepatoduodenal ligament after division of the bile duct, stomach, or proximal duodenum and pancreatic body. The \"Uncinate First\" approach is a technical modification with a retrograde dissection of the pancreatic head as a novel surgical procedure. Caudo-cranial resection of the pancreatic head is characterized by starting with the uncinate process after division and mobilization of the first jejunal loop. Transection of the upper gastrointestinal structures (bile duct, stomach or duodenum and pancreas) is performed at the end of the resection. The retrograde Uncinate First technique offers a comfortable and innovative approach for partial pancreatico-duodenectomy. The superior mesenteric artery as well as the portal and superior mesenteric vein can be very accurately dissected and controlled during the resection phase associated with potentially less blood loss and a more radical resection along the medial margin, which is often the site of R1 resections. Future studies are required to evaluate this procedure regarding operative parameters and postoperative outcome compared with the standard resection. ","1041":"In view of the fact that appendectomy is the most common operation for an acute abdomen, laparoscopic appendectomy has evolved as the most frequently performed procedure. Hospitals, therefore, require at all times the expertise, technique, and staff to ensure a high quality of standard for appendectomies, which not only supports the requirements of the high caseload but also takes into consideration the socio-economical aspects. A critical step is the closure of the appendicular stump. The three most widely employed techniques are an endo-stapler, an endo-loop, or a clip. Although the endo-stapler is fairly expensive, it combines closing and transecting the appendix in one step, offers the possibility of a partial caecal resection, and can be used if the appendicular base is inflamed. Endo-loop and clip are equally cost-effective, but the clip appears to be simpler in handling than the endo-loop and, like the stapler, offers closing and cutting the appendix before dissecting the mesoappendix. However, only appendices up to 16 mm in diameter can be clipped, a disadvantage not shared with the loop.

Creating large amounts of pulsed UV light with any device, including a laser, remained difficult until excimer lasers were invented in the following decade. The invention of excimer lasers coincided with the advent of balloon angioplasty, leading physicians to speculate about using laser energy to obliterate obstructing arterial lesions. The first report of laser energy to vaporize an atherosclerotic plaque appeared in 1980. The ensuing decades witnessed dramatic refinements of laser fibers, laser energy sources, and catheter delivery systems. The favorable results achieved with excimer laser angioplasty in the early 2000s led to a renewed interest in this technology and to the current widespread use of these devices to treat peripheral as well as coronary artery disease. This paper provides a review of laser energy principles, traces the history of the use of lasers to treat vascular disease, and reviews the current literature pertaining to laser angioplasty and limb salvage.

Availability and prompt use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the field for treatment of divers with dysbaric conditions has demonstrated its efficacy in acute, co-morbid conditions such as acute exsanguination, blast injury, crush injury, and cardiopulmonary arrest affecting those same divers. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy applied in these cases has demonstrated its utility to augment the efficacy of conventional, pre-hospital advanced cardiac life support and advanced trauma life support. Case studies gleaned from actual experience with the diving industry illustrate the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in these conditions. The unexpectedly favorable results have been replicated by controlled laboratory animal studies. The deck decompression or saturation multiplace chambers used by offshore diving operations can easily and quickly be converted for use as medical field resuscitative units. Lightweight and mobile hyperbaric chambers can be outfitted for use in ambulances or helicopters to address civilian street injury or military \"far-forward\" injury. These transport chambers are compact in design to be efficient transport stretchers designed to hold both the patient and the medical support clinician. It is hoped that hyperbaric oxygen therapy will gain an increasing role as an adjunct to pre-hospital advanced cardiac life support and advanced trauma life support resuscitative efforts as a low-cost, high-yield intervention.

Importantly, aberrant expression or activity of miRNAs can lead to a disease state. However, the role of miRNAs in chronic wounds remains to be elucidated. This article reviews available literature on the role of miRNAs in a range of processes important for successful wound healing including epidermal differentiation and proliferation, inflammation and angiogenesis.

This is an initial SILS experience in reconstructive urology to prove feasibility and provide a comparison with conventional laparoscopy during perioperative and convalescent periods. A single surgeon performed two complex SILS operations (psoas bladder hitch with Boari flap for high ureteric stricture [SILS-PB] and nephropexy for severe nephroptosis [SILS-Np]). A group of 6 patients with previous experience with conventional laparoscopy by the same surgeon with the same operation complexity was selected for retrospective comparison. SILS was performed through multichannel port (intraumbilical or retroperitoneal). There was no conversion to laparoscopy. Operative time (Or-t) was 365 and 185 minutes for SILS-PB and SILS-Np, respectively. Blood loss was 100 ml for SILS-PB without any intraoperative complications. Baseline demographics, Or-t, blood loss, and hospital stay were comparable to the laparoscopic group. Except for prolonged Or-t, patients undergoing SILS had similar surgical outcomes and comparable convalescent periods. Follow-up was uneventful for both groups. Patients' global satisfaction and willingness to recommend their procedure to others were favorable and equivalent between groups. Thus, SILS-reconstructive operations for high ureteric strictures and severe nephroptosis are feasible. It seems equally as efficacious as conventional laparoscopy maintaining surgical standards without differences in perioperative outcomes and convalescence.

Currently, anterior cervical discectomy and fusion is the standard procedure for the treatment of cervical disc herniations and cervical degenerative disorders, whereas endoscopic cervical discectomy is considered an important alternative. Despite the advancement in surgical technology, endoscopically removing hard pathological tissues remains challenging. Inspired by lumbar epidurogram-guided decompression, we have developed an epidurogram-guided endoscopic cervical decompression technique. The technique uses contrast dye through cervical discography to generate an epidurogram. Under fluoroscopic view, the spinal cord is posterior to the contrast line. The endoscopic instruments can safely reach the epidural space, if it's necessary, as long as they stay anterior to the contrast line. We have used this technique to treat both soft and hard cervical disc herniations, and we have found it makes the surgical procedures safer when more aggressive decompression is required.","1051":"Symptomatic degenerated spinal discs and spinal stenosis are common problems that can often be treated conservatively, but some require decompressive spinal surgery for relief. Traditional open spinal discectomy is associated with significant tissue trauma, higher morbidity and complication rates, a longer convalescence, and even destabilization of the spine. The trend of spinal surgery is rapidly moving toward less traumatic minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS).1,2 The problem that faces the surgeon performing endoscopic MISS is that it is done with limited surgical exposure and visualization of the surgical field. The surgical field can only be viewed through an endoscope to correlate the lesion\/pathology in relationship to imaging studies aided by C-arm fluoroscopy. In response, a logical and simple Grid Positioning System (GPS) was developed to provide a precise surgical trajectory\/approach for the disc lesion to undergo decompression. GPS involves 3D geometric triangulation of 3 different planes guided by fluoroscopy for introduction of surgical instruments along a geometric line toward the lesion without compromising healthy anatomical structures. This system facilitates MISS, especially in the morbidly obese. In this chapter, we will describe the GPS system and its application to aid in facilitating minimally invasive decompressive spine surgery for alleviating symptoms of degenerative spinal disease, herniated disc, and spinal stenosis, while avoiding the complications and risks of conventional more traumatic spinal surgery and fusion.","1052":null,"1053":"Previous studies have demonstrated that using a bipolar sealer device for hemostasis in hip and knee arthroplasty results in a decreased blood loss and transfusion requirement.

Fifty orthopaedic surgeons responded to a 19-question survey regarding custom-fit positioning total knee arthroplasty as part of a regional orthopaedic meeting. Overall, 10 of the 50 surgeons surveyed reported using custom-fit positioning technology. Of the remaining questionnaire participants, 29 of 40 indicated that they were interested in trying the new technique. The two reasons that were most frequently cited by the surgeons who were not interested in adopting the technique were costs and not enough clinical outcomes reports. The results of the present study suggest that if additional clinical studies at longer-term follow-up support these findings, then more surgeons may adopt this technique. Although cost was a perceived barrier to using this technique, the results of this survey suggest that some surgeons who use this technique may have reduced procedure time.","1055":"Concerns about blood loss and the safety of allogenic blood transfusion have led to the development of many transfusion options for lower extremity joint arthroplasty. Techniques for dealing with such blood loss include allogenic blood transfusion, autologous donation and transfusion, hemodilution, perioperative blood salvage, intraoperative cell savers, bipolar sealers, and pharmacological agents. A blood management strategy must consider both the patient and the surgical procedure, assess the transfusion risks, and formulate a plan to address them appropriately. This article is an overview of the blood management techniques for lower extremity joint arthroplasty. The purpose of this review is to report our opinion regarding the use of alternative blood management strategies and to discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of each technique. The results of this review indicate that a patient-focused algorithm using one or more strategies such as preoperative administration of erythropoietin, preoperative autologous blood donation, use of a bipolar sealer, intraoperative blood collection and reinfusion, as well as postoperative reinfusion drains may reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusions in patients undergoing primary and revision lower-extremity joint arthroplasties.

This study attempts to identify a method to supplement the surgeon's tactile and auditory senses by analyzing vibration characteristics during femoral component impaction. A cementless femoral component was instrumented with accelerometers and a piezoelectric (PZT) patch. Data was obtained during implant impaction into replicate femurs. Acceleration measurements were obtained and signal processing techniques were applied. Metrics were analyzed from PZT excitation data. The two most correlative indices are the frequency of the anti-resonance in the 10.5 to 12 kHz band and the peak magnitude in the 9 to 11 kHz band. Both demonstrate good convergence as the prosthesis is inserted. Impact test data revealed the sum of the acceleration divided by the sum of the impact force demonstrates good convergence with implant insertion. This pattern of convergence indicates these two indices may demonstrate the ability to accurately predict optimal implant seating. This methodology is promising and has the potential to enable intraoperative determination of maximal femoral component seating and provide the surgeon valuable information to potentially prevent intraoperative fractures.","1057":"In the case of extensively damaged meta-diaphyseal femoral bone with cortices thinning and widened femoral canal, tapered stems allow a good primary fixation and early weight-bearing. A retrospective review was conducted to evaluate long-term results of modular revision taper stems implanted from March 1999 to December 2002. Sixty-five consecutive hip revision surgeries were performed, mostly for aseptic loosening (75% of the cases). Femoral bone stock defects were classified according to AAOS's criteria and consisted mainly in type II (cavitary defects, 44.6%) and type III (combined defects, 33.9%). A trochanteric osteotomy was performed in 25 cases (38%) to remove primary implants that were cemented in 35 cases (54%). The mean postoperative follow-up was 109 months (range, 76 to 131 months). Clinical assessment at follow-up showed a significantly improved mean Harris Hip Score from 42 points preoperatively to 81 points postoperatively, while the x-ray examination did show a satisfactory distal integration of the stem in all cases and satisfactory reconstitution of the femoral bone stock in 47% of cases.

Although there are multiple reconstructive options available, a cementless acetabular component inserted with screws has been shown to have good intermediate-term results and is the reconstructive method of choice for the majority of acetabular revisions This reconstruction is feasible provided at least 50% of the implant contacts host bone. When such contact is not possible, and there is adequate medial and peripheral bone, techniques using alternative uncemented implants can be used for acetabular reconstruction. An uncemented cup can be placed at a \"high hip center.\" Alternatively, the acetabular cavity can be progressively reamed to accommodate extra-large cups. Oblong cups, which take advantage of the oval-shaped cavity resulting from many failed acetabular components, can also be used. The success of these cementless techniques depends on the degree and location of bone loss. The correct indication to revision and the choice of the correct implant is the keystone for the success of this type of surgery and follows an accurate preoperative planning in order to understand the specific pathologic scenario. The aim of this paper is to review some technical options for the revision of the acetabular component also taking into account our personal experiences and series.","1060":"Modular total hip arthroplasty (THA) components have evolved significantly as the success of uncemented femoral fixation has been proven. Current trends in the United States include widespread use of cementless components (acetabular and femoral), usually with monoblock femoral stems with modular heads. Femoral offset has been proven to play a vital role in hip abductor strength, hip range of motion, and hip stability. Also critical to hip stability is the orientation of the acetabular and femoral components. Thus, offset and component positioning are fundamental to success in THA. Modularity of the femoral neck has been proposed to aid in further customizing the THA component fit. Neck-modular stems enable the adjustment of leg length, femoral anteversion, and femoral offset independently of stem size. Modularity of the neck allows the surgeon to precisely match the anatomic characteristics of each patient to yield improved range of motion, stability, abductor strength, and leg length equality. Disadvantages are related to cost and the addition of another interface. Neck-modular femoral stems are not a new concept; however, as tough component manufacturing has advanced, these stems have been reintroduced to the armamentarium of the hip surgeon.","1061":"Metal-on-metal bearings are promoted as a low wear bearing alternative to traditional hip replacement bearings. While most in vitro studies support this, recent clinical reviews have found a significant number of early revisions in some designs of metal-on-metal bearings related to wear. Metal-on-metal bearings exhibit a bi-phasic wear pattern with high initial wear that generally settles down to low steady state wear. Previous publications from the authors have found that steady state wear occurs due to the formation of a critical conforming contact area. This contact area was found to be surprisingly constant regardless of bearing size, clearance, or even contact mode. The authors hypothesized that steady state wear may never be reached if formation of this critical conforming contact area is disrupted. Several hip simulator tests were performed to assess the wear performance of generic metal-on-metal samples at various angles of inclination. Three-dimensional modeling was performed on the generic bearing design as well as typical resurfacing and hemispherical bearing designs including various sizes and clearance ranges. Simulator results support the hypotheses, and wear rates were linear or accelerating when the critical contact area size could not be achieved due to its proximity to the rim of the bearing. Modeling studies show a correlation between bearing size and design and the maximum inclination angle allowed to reach steady state conditions. Smaller bearing size and shallower cup designs were found to reduce the maximum safe inclination angle and this corresponds to clinical observation of increased failure rates in these bearings. This simple method for assessing runaway wear risk can be utilized in the design of more robust and forgiving metal-on-metal bearings.","1062":"The past few decades have seen a very rapid change in the manner in which infrarenal aortic disease is diagnosed and dealt with. The approach has changed from open, large incision surgery with long and complicated postoperative courses to minimally invasive techniques in which the patient can go home the next day. A large number of devices have come and gone, and techniques to deal with aortic problems are ever changing. We have reviewed the past, current, and future technology to help make the treatment options more clear.","1063":"Stroke is the third most common cause of mortality, and carotid artery stenosis causes 8% to 29% of all ischemic strokes. Best medical treatment forms the basis of carotid stenosis treatment, and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has an additional beneficial effect in high-grade stenosis. Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has challenged CEA as a primary carotid intervention. At present, CEA remains the gold standard, but in the future, CAS techniques will evolve and might become beneficial for subgroups of patients with carotid stenosis. This chapter briefly describes the history of carotid interventions and current consensus and controversies in CEA. In the last two years, several meta-analyses were published on a variety of aspects of best medical treatment, CEA, and CAS. It is still a matter of debate as to whether asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis should undergo a carotid intervention. Especially because medical treatment has dramatically evolved since the early carotid trials. On the other hand, it is clear that carotid interventions in symptomatic patients with a high-grade stenosis should be performed as early as possible after the initial neurological event in order to achieve optimal stroke risk reduction. In CEA, the use of patching is advocated above primary closure, while the role of selective patching is still unclear. No differences in stroke and mortality rates are observed for routine versus selective shunting, for conventional versus eversion CEA, or for local versus general anesthesia. It is anticipated that in the future, there will be several interesting developments in carotid interventions such as plaque morphology analysis, acute interventions during stroke in progress, and further evolvement of CAS techniques.","1064":"Since the 2006 Surgical Technology International monograph on valvular prostheses, there have been significant developmental and investigative advances, particularly for transcatheter implantation. Aortic bioprostheses and mechanical prostheses continue to incorporate design changes to optimize hemodynamics and prevent prosthesis-patient mismatch and to have a potential satisfactory influence on survival. There have been continual technological improvements striving to bring forward advances that improve the durability of bioprostheses and reduce the thrombogenicity of mechanical prostheses. There also has been a continuance to preserve biological tissue with glutaraldehyde, rather than clinically evaluate other cross-linking technologies, by controlling or retarding calcification with therapies to control phospholipids and residual aldehydes. The techniques of mitral valve reconstruction have now been well established, and annuloplasty rings have been designed for the potential of maintaining the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the mitral annulus. There has been limited advancement in the past four years for interventional annuloplasty, for remodeling of the length and shape of the dilated annulus, prevention of dilatation of the annulus, and support for the potentially fragile area after partial-leaflet resection. Currently, there continues to be emergence of catheter-based therapies, particularly for management of aortic stenosis but not mitral regurgitation. For management of selected populations with critical aortic stenosis, the techniques for aortic valve substitution have had further advancement for retrograde catheter techniques, as well as apical transventricular implantation. There has not been significant advancement during the past four years to address mitral regurgitation by experimental transcoronary sinus, stent-like devices and transventricular, edge-to-edge leaflet devices. The devices, descriptions, and pictorial images comprising this monograph have been limited to technologies that are considered to be predominant, at least for the immediate duration. The general purpose of the monograph is to serve as an educational document.","1065":"We evaluated the safety, efficacy, and potential benefits of using the linear-cutter staplers in the ileal reanastomosis and ileal pouch reconstruction following radical cystectomy in patients with invasive carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Radical cystectomy and orthotopic ileal bladder substitution procedures were performed in 40 patients with invasive carcinoma of the urinary bladder. In 20 patients the linear- cutter stapling device was used for the ileo-ilial reanastomosis and reconstruction of the pouch, while in the other 20 patients the standard hand-suturing technique was used. Using the linear-cutter stapler in the ileo-ileal reanastromasis and ileal pouch reconstruction saved approximately 60 to 90 minutes of operative time, and there was also a significant reduction of blood loss during this period. The leakage rate and hospital stay were less in patients with a stapled pouch. Urodynamic characteristics were comparable to standard ileal neobladders.","1066":"Since its initial clinical use in urology, there has been an increasing enthusiasm and a growing interest for laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS). Several clinical series have been reported with an estimated cumulative clinical experience of more than four hundred so far. Nowadays, virtually all extirpative and reconstructive urological procedures have been described and shown to be feasible and safe, including advanced reconstructive procedures and major extirpative ones. Among them, adrenalectomy and partial nephrectomy represent highly complex procedures. Initial clinical data have been recently reported to test the safety and efficacy of these interventions in selected patients. Herein, we describe our initial cases of unclamp LESS partial nephrectomy and adrenalectomy. In our opinion, LESS is an established technique within the field of minimally invasive surgery. Even if further studies are needed to demonstrate its actual benefits, early clinical outcomes are encouraging and LESS might represent the way to go in minimally invasive urological surgery.","1067":null,"1068":"Laparoscopy was considered marginal to surgical specialties before 1990. Rare innovations in instruments were done. With the realization of the first laparoscopic hysterectomy, this surgical route gained wide acceptance during the 1990s. Technical advances were made by instrument companies offering a wide variety of instruments to surgeons and by surgeons themselves to cope with problems during laparoscopic procedures. Manipulators are among the first instruments that surgeons suggested to ameliorate laparoscopic performance. Instruments that have multiple functions (i.e., grasping, cutting, coagulating) are more and more appreciated because surgeons can avoid changing instruments during surgery. Manipulators offer multifunctional assistance during gynecologic surgical procedures. They are useful for exposure purposes and also for reproductive surgery (and hysterectomy). This article explains the benefits and help that a manipulator can provide, especially in total laparoscopic hysterectomy. In the latter intervention, the manipulator will help to expose the pelvis by moving the uterus in any direction, to identify structures and find anatomical landmarks such as the vaginal fornices for culdotomy, and to avoid complications by pulling the ureter away from the operative field. Also, it is useful to avoid carbon dioxide leakage at the vaginal opening and to retrieve the surgical specimen. Each step is shown in a photograph with the specific hand movements corresponding to the manipulator's handling. We think that the use of manipulators during laparoscopic surgery is very useful and helps to reduce operative time.","1069":"The modified suspension technique for reanastomosis of the fallopian tube enables safer and more accurate placement of sutures at the anastomotic site. For all of the primary sutures, this technique enables careful inspection of the tissue layers prior to final approximation of the two tubal segments, thereby significantly reducing the possibilities of technical errors, such as posterior wall inclusion. This approach does not require the use of approximating clamps, and is an organized, well-staged approach.","1070":null,"1071":"Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a significant health problem for many women. Surgical treatment of AUB often follows failed attempts with first-line medical therapy. Hysterectomy, while being a definitive treatment, is a major surgical procedure with potential for significant complications and economic costs. Endometrial ablation was developed as an alternative to hysterectomy. The first-generation endometrial ablation devices required extensive training and experience to be performed effectively and safely. As a result, newer ablative devices were developed addressing the need for less technical knowledge and improved safety. Since 1997, the United States FDA has approved 5 global endometrial ablation devices for treatment of AUB attributable to benign causes. This review will focus on the technical aspects of these second- generation devices and their applications for treatment of AUB.","1072":"Laparo-endoscopic single site (LESS) surgery has recently gained broader acceptance as a less-invasive approach to traditional multi-port laparoscopic procedures. LESS hysterectomy represents the gynecologic surgeon's progression toward this goal of performing minimally invasive hysterectomy procedures through increasingly fewer incisions. Although this procedure offers improved cosmesis and potentially decreased post-operative pain, there are also many challenges to adoption of this surgical procedure. LESS hysterectomy is associated with a steep learning curve and the need for the gynecologic surgeon to adopt new technologies and develop a new set of surgical skills. Following the basic principles of LESS surgery is essential for the gynecologic surgeon to safely and efficiently adopt this surgical procedure. Advances in surgical instrumentation will continue to allow surgeons to perform increasingly complex LESS surgical procedures in the future.","1073":"Since Ramirez et al. presented the first case of component separation for abdominal wall hernias in 1990, it has undergone multiple modifications. This technique, which has been mainly used for large hernias where primary closure of the abdominal wall is not feasible, or for staged management of patients with open abdomens, results in multiple wound complications. In 2007, Rosen et al. reported on the laparoscopic approach to component separation that is associated with less subcutaneous dissection and the consequent advantage of a decreased risk of flap necrosis and wound infection. Here we discuss our totally laparoscopic approach to abdominal wall reconstruction. A minimally invasive abdominal wall reconstruction consists of a bilateral component separation, an intra-abdominal adhesiolysis, primary approximation of rectus muscles, and placement of an intraperitoneal mesh for reinforcing the repair, all performed laparoscopically. Patient-selection criteria, detailed operative technique, tips in preventing and managing the potential pitfalls, and postoperative care are discussed.","1074":null,"1075":null,"1076":"Laparoscopic gastric banding is now well established as an effective means of obtaining safe, healthy weight loss in the morbidly obese patient population. The procedure has evolved over the years to minimize complications and optimize results. Preoperative patient evaluation includes upper endoscopy to assess the baseline integrity of the stomach and rule out pathology. Upper endoscopy fails to demonstrate the majority of small hiatal hernias in these patients preoperatively. Hiatal hernias are grossly underappreciated in patients with morbid obesity due to the presence of a large distal esophageal fat pad. With post-operative internal weight loss, a small crural defect can become relatively large in a short amount of time. Performing gastric banding without dissecting and repairing the hiatal hernia can lead to incorrect positioning of the gastric band, which is associated with poor weight loss, chronic reflux, and increased complications. Concomitant hiatal hernia repair is felt by the authors to be a necessary component for the correct placement of the gastric band device, which, in turn, provides excellent long-term results to our patients.","1077":"Different factors (strategic, anatomical, instrumental, etc.) can cause difficult surgical situations, especially in bariatric surgery. In a difficult surgical situation, the surgeon faces a dilemma as to whether to continue the intended operation \"at all costs\" or to deviate from the initially planned surgical procedure to some alternative technique or procedure. The dilemmatic nature of the difficult surgical situation in bariatric surgery has motivated us to discuss the following aspects because they all contribute to the problem: standards in bariatric surgery, deviation from standards, the role of experts, and the focus of research. We also propose to classify bariatric patients according to intraoperative difficulty (I to IV) as: (I) ideal cases (i.e., easy to operate, no problems), (II) not quite ideal cases (some minor difficulties may occur), (III) problematic cases (difficult to operate, some operative techniques are considerably more difficult than others), and (IV) very difficult cases (every operative step is difficult). We discuss the establishment of a registry of difficult surgical situations including the possibilities of deviating from the standard. Scientific analyses of such registries should focus on patients with apparent modifications in treatment (process deviations), but might also look at those with surprisingly good or bad results (outcome deviations). The technical steps of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) have been chosen to illustrate this concept.","1078":"Minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer has been an important treatment modality since its introduction in 1991 from Japan. The practice of surgical techniques in laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection is improving and evolving. Furthermore, advanced techniques including total gastrectomy, proximal gastrectomy, extended lymph node dissection and robot-assisted gastrectomy, have been safely carried out. A retrospective multicenter study in Japan has shown that the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic gastrectomy are beneficial, and the long-term outcomes are the same as those for open surgery. Recently, prospective multicenter randomized controlled trials have been conducted in Japan and Korea to evaluate the safety and oncological feasibility of laparoscopic gastrectomy for clinical stage I gastric cancer or advanced gastric cancer. In the future, laparoscopic surgeons will need to design and implement education and training systems for standard laparoscopic procedures based on the clinical outcomes of multicenter randomized controlled trials.","1079":"Revision of gastric bypasses that fail is one of the most difficult challenges that face bariatric surgeons these days. Adding a foreign body like a band or a silastic may give unsatisfactory results, while increasing malabsorption may result in severe malnutrition and hypoproteinemia. Laparoscopic jejunal sleeve is based on the principles of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy applied to a failed Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The procedure is simple and involves only stapling, is reproducible, accessible, effective, and safe, without foreign bodies. Weight loss may be achieved to give an extra 5 to 10 points of BMI reduction. Early complications are similar to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and may involve leaks and strictures. Mid- and long-term weight loss data are lacking at the present time, and patients should be selected based on an initial response to their gastric bypass.","1080":"As the prevalence of obesity has dramatically increased and obesity has become one of the leading public health threats worldwide, the number of bariatric surgeries performed has been exponentially increasing. According to a recent survey, over 90% of bariatric procedures are performed by laparoscopic approach. The most commonly performed procedures are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (open and laparoscopic), followed by laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy. Definite geographic trends are observable in the specific bariatric procedures being performed. A number of studies have already demonstrated the efficacy of bariatric surgery for the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities, although there are still only a handful of prospective, controlled studies with a high level of evidence. Considering the results derived from a large-scale, prospective, multicenter study and a systematic review, it can be reasonably said that bariatric surgery is a safe and feasible intervention for the treatment of life-threatening morbid obesity under controlled conditions. So far, several studies have shown improved survival rates for patients who undergo bariatric surgery compared with a control cohort of severely obese patients who did not. In addition, bariatric surgery seems to have a positive impact on the economy, although currently only about 1-2% of eligible patients with morbid obesity receive bariatric surgery. In this mini-review article, we summarize bariatric surgery outcomes by quoting some of the recently published landmark articles.","1081":"Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery has developed as a new surgical modality producing increased cosmetic benefits over conventional endoscopic surgery. However, there are limited reports about LESS surgery in liver diseases. We reported a case of a giant hapatic cyst that was treated by LESS surgery. LESS fenestration was performed on a 60-year-old female. A 2.2-cm umbilical incision was made. Three laparoscopic trocars were individually inserted into the abdominal cavity via a single umbilical incision. Only straight laparoscopic instruments were applied throughout the procedures. Aspiration, dome resection, argon laser coagulation, drainage, and removal were performed by LESS surgery. One of the 5-mm trocars was replaced with a 12-mm trocar to retrieve the resected cyst wall. All of the procedures for liver fenestration were the same as conventional laparoscopy and were successfully performed without any difficulties. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. The LESS surgery has been successfully applied to liver fenestration as an available alternative to conventional laparoscopic fenestration. This method is technically feasible and results in superior cosmesis.","1082":"Colostomy is one of the most frequent procedures in emergency surgery. Several techniques have been described. The aim of this essay is to present our results using a circular stapler device when executing an end-type colostomy raising in emergency surgery. During a period of 4 years, 47 patients underwent end-type colostomy raised under emergency circumstances using a circular stapler device. We gathered information on each patient, and performed 2 years follow-up. Forty-seven patients, 72.3% male and 27.7% female, were enrolled in this study. The most common indication was colorectal cancer (48.9%). We had an average rate of complications of 13.63% without a need to be operated on: parastomal hernia (6.81%), mild local cellulitis (4.54%), and retraction (2.27%). The medium diameter of colostomy at the time of surgery and after 1 month was equal to 3.4 cm and 3.1 cm respectively. Follow-up screenings showed that the diameter of colostomy held constant at 3 cm. End-type colostomy using a stapler device can be safely performed under emergency circumstances. It is not related to a higher rate of stomal stenosis in our series. This is the first essay that reports the diameter of colostomy with this technique. Early and late complications are similar to those that appear with the classical technique. Therefore, the end-type colostomy executed by means of a circular stapler device can be considered a safe and reliable technique. ","1083":null,"1084":"These days the treatment of rectal cancer remains an encounter for various medical disciplines. A key position in the whole concept of therapy is still taken by surgery itself. To facilitate the advantages of the total mesorectal excision (TME) we used the water-jet dissector (WJD) in our surgical routine. Our object was to analyze perioperative data as well as oncological long-term results following WJD-assisted rectal resection. A total of 226 patients underwent surgery for rectal cancer in our center between October 2001 and June 2009. A retrospective review was performed of all WJD-assisted rectal resections during this time. One hundred and five patients with adenocarcinoma of the lower and middle rectum were operated on by 7 surgeons according to the concept of TME. Seventy-six patients underwent a low anterior resection, 29 patients an abdominoperineal resection. Twenty-eight patients received preoperative radiochemotherapy. The median follow-up period amounted to 35 (2-96) months. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 5.7%, wound healing disturbance (including perineal wound infections) in 29.5%, intra-abdominal infections in 7.6% and urinary tract infections in 7.6%. Postoperative bladder dysfunction (requiring catheterization) occurred in 1.9%. Postoperative 30-day mortality was 0%, 60-day mortality 1%. The rate of local recurrence (including three patients who refused postoperative radiochemotherapy) was 8.5%. Cancer-specific survival at 5 years was 74% and differed significantly by stage. The particular advance of the WJD is the facile development of the embryological plane between the mesorectal fascia and the surrounding pelvic nerves. Without harming one of them, maximum radicality and excellent autonomic nerve preservation can be achieved. The WJD is a technique with acceptable postoperative morbidity and low mortality. Local control and survival are comparable to other surgical centers in international literature. ","1085":"Minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized the art of surgical practice. The laparoscopic approach to cholecystectomy has become the gold standard and is the most common laparoscopic general surgery procedure worldwide. In an effort to further enhance the advantages of laparoscopic surgery even less-invasive methods have been attempted, including smaller and fewer incisions. The objective of this study was to describe our results with over 15 years of needlescopic cholecystectomies. At the Texas Endosurgery Institute, 434 operations were done by a single surgeon from 1995 to 2010. Eighty-six percent of subjects were female, and the average age of all subjects was 41.9 years (range 14-82). The average operating time was 59.3 minutes (range 30-200). The 200-minute operation required laparoscopic CBD exploration, accounting for the extended time. Average estimated intraoperative blood loss (EBL) was &lt;15 cc (range 0-50 cc). Two percent of cases required conversion to standard 5-mm cholecystectomy and were completed without incident. All patients are followed up at two weeks and then at six months. Since 1995, only one patient presented with a hernia at the umbilical site. Otherwise, no wound, bile duct, bile leak, bleeding, or thermal injury complications have been identified.","1086":"Diabetic foot ulcers are a marker of far more serious underlying co-morbidities that often represent a precursor to infection, amputation, and death. The treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is marked by many options that represent both potential opportunity and hindrance. Thousands of products are available to the provider, yet confusion often exists as to the indications, as well as when and how to use such modalities. Increased availability of treatment modalities can be overwhelming to providers, and as such, can lead to reliance on outdated and unproven methods. Current diabetic foot ulcer treatment options are often based on clinical and anecdotal findings. Evidencebased treatment options are limited. An overview of diabetic foot ulcer management is presented in an organized manner to assist providers in their decision making in treating diabetic foot ulcers, with a goal of improving clinical outcomes and reducing amputations.","1087":"Diabetic foot ulcers are a common problem in clinical practice and one of the most common complications in diabetic patients, often leading to amputation and hospitalization. Although there are a number of options for coadjuvant therapy for diabetic foot ulcers, a considerable number of patients remain unhealed after 12 weeks of treatment and, in general, rates of healing remain low. For these reasons, as well as the rising costs of associated complications of nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers, there is an impetus for the research community to develop more sophisticated ways to manage this condition. We reviewed ongoing clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov) testing new therapies for foot ulcers and searched the basic science literature for preclinical background of these products. We focused our review on new therapies that include topicals, skin substitutes, bioengineered skin, cellular therapy growth factors, devices, and herbal medications. All of these options are analyzed and presented in this review as promising new options for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.","1088":"Wound infection is common and delays wound healing. Validated signs included in the mnemonic NERDS and STONEES can be used to identify whether bacterial damage is superficial or deep, respectively. Clinicians must discern when bacterial damage has occurred on a timely basis and what treatment strategies to institute. A variety of topical antimicrobial agents have been developed incorporating iodine, chlorhexidine, silver, honey, topical oxygen, and topical antibiotics. Selection of appropriate strategies should be based on three key factors: healability (healable versus nonhealable), bacterial burden (colonization versus deep infection), and host risk factors. This article reviews and offers succinct recommendations pertaining to the management of wound infection in clinical practice.","1089":"Recent innovations in the field of wound healing have created numerous advanced therapies from which clinicians may now choose. The challenge for the reconstructive surgeon is to ensure that these adjunct technologies are used according to an evidence-based protocol to ensure optimal healing. Critical to successful outcomes is that new modes of therapy do not supplant, but are used in tandem with, core principles of wound management: establishing a correct diagnosis, ensuring a good local blood supply, debriding the wound to a clean base, correcting the biomechanical abnormality, and nurturing the wound until it shows signs of healing. Debridement should be performed as often as necessary until the wound is deemed clean and ready for reconstruction. Useful adjuncts in debridement include hydrotherapy and ultrasonic therapy. The majority of reconstructions are accomplished through simple techniques. If a wound is not meeting the expected healing trajectory, management adjuncts such as negative pressure wound therapy, growth factor, cultured skin, and hyperbaric oxygen can then reactivate or expedite the process toward achieving a healed wound.","1090":"With the introduction of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), there has been interest in the general surgery community for developing safe, scarless surgery. NOTES itself brought additional risks to GI surgery, and as such it has not achieved mainstream acceptance. Single site is considered by many surgeons as a bridge between traditional laparoscopic surgery and NOTES without the inherent risks of NOTES. However, initial single-site procedures using standard instrumentation are technically challenging due to the absence of instruments that facilitate triangulation, avoid conflicts between the instruments and the camera, maintain pneumoperitoneum, and reduce operative stress. The TransEnterix SPIDER platform has been created to overcome these difficulties. The SPIDER is a sterile and disposable device that contains 4 working channels (2 flexible instrument delivery tubes positioned laterally and 2 rigid channels, superiorly and inferiorly to accommodate an endoscope or any of the shelf rigid surgical instruments). Procedures facilitated by this platform are considered to use a hybrid flexible laparoscopic technique. Initial experience in over 100 cases with the SPIDER, including colectomy, cholecystectomy and adjustible gastric banding, has shown this system to be effective. Technical pearls when using the SPIDER include pulling rather than pushing, and increased use of electrocautery. These learning curve lessons for flexible laparoscopy will be described in detail, including a discussion of advantages and disadvantages. The SPIDER platform facilitates safe and straightforward single-site laparoscopic surgery.","1091":"We describe our laparoscopic nephrectomy technique of placing trocars directly on the fascia once the skin and the subcutaneous layers are prepared. A series of 10 consecutive patients were operated on by single-incision laparoscopic nephrectomy (SILN). With a 5-cm mean skin incision, the fascia was prepared and 3\/4 trocars inserted separately directly on the fascia. Surgical strategy followed the standard technique, except for the use of articulating instruments and 5-mm optic. Demographics, body mass index (BMI), operative time, blood loss, perioperative complications, transfusions, hemoglobin decrease, analgesic requirement, length of stay, and final pathology were recorded. Postoperative and prior-to-discharge visual analogue scale (VAS) pain evaluations were also collected, together with the limitations inherent in the instruments' placement and parallel driving during the procedure. The procedures were successfully completed in all but one case. The mean operative time was 169 min. (mean blood loss 113 ml). Without major perioperative complications, the patients were discharged early (mean 5.3 days). Four patients had a BMI&gt;30. For specimen retrieval (neoplasms) two trocar holes were joined. One patient required analgesics; the mean post-operative and prior-to-discharge VAS scores were 5.7 and 1.4, respectively. Pathology examination confirmed 4 pyelonephritic kidneys, 4 renal carcinomas, and 2 upper-urinary tract carcinomas. The laparoscopic nephrectomy via a single incision is feasible and safe, with favorable perioperative and short-term outcomes. It's technically more challenging than standard laparoscopy requiring advanced surgical skills.","1092":"There has been an emergence of reduced port techniques for laparoscopic surgery over the past three years. Although growing in presentations and papers, few scientific studies have yet to be published demonstrating benefits and risks of these techniques. In particular, very little is mentioned regarding the increased costs. This brings to the forefront the concept that the development of new surgical techniques should adhere to safe standards of surgery and undergo continued evaluation during development to ensure they maintain safety, and are able to be reproduced by our colleagues. Evaluation also needs to focus on costs, both economical and ecological. A review of our first three years experience of single port access surgery has been done. Costs in terms of both the potential economic and environmental impact have also been evaluated as compared with multiport procedures. In the first 36 months of this evolving technique, we were able to mimic multiport procedures with similar results. The costs of single port access are less than comparable multiport procedures, both in terms of dollars as well as medical waste. We are able to now offer \"proof of concept\" of a novel reduced port procedure from four important aspects in the development of new surgical techniques. We demonstrate comparable results in terms of outcomes and safety, improvement in financial and environmental costs, as well as showing initial success with training and application of the procedure by our colleagues.","1093":"Surgical training is undergoing drastic changes, and new strategies should be adopted to keep quality standards. The authors review and advocate the use of surgical recordings as a useful complement to current training, assessment, and revalidation modalities. For trainees, such recordings would promote quality-based and competence-based surgical training and allow for self-evaluation. Video logbooks could be used to aid interaction between trainer and trainee, and facilitate formative assessment. Recordings of surgery could also be integrated into trainees' portfolios and regular assessments. Finally, such recordings could make surgeons' revalidation more sensible. The routine use of records of surgical procedures could become an integral component of the standard of care. This would have been an unattractive suggestion until recently, as analogue recording techniques are inconvenient, cumbersome, and time consuming. Today, however, with the advent of inexpensive digital technologies, such a concept is realistic and is likely to improve patient care.","1094":"In recent years, laparoscopic surgery underwent a huge investment from both the clinical and research points of view to perform classic procedures through a single (S) incision or single port, resulting in the development of different instruments and ports. The main advantage of the S-access laparoscopy (SAL) is cosmesis. Future investigations will provide other potential advantages, such as improvement in postoperative pain and patient satisfaction. We report our initial experience on 115 patients utilizing a SAL (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, incisional hernia repair, Nissen fundoplication, upper gastrointestinal surgery, diagnostic laparoscopy, hepatic resection, splenectomy), along with the new curved reusable instruments (Karl Storz-Endoskope, Tuttlingen, Germany). The curves of the instruments enable the surgeon to work in an ergonomic position similar to classic laparoscopy, establishing a working triangulation inside the abdomen as well as outside. The cost of SAL is similar to classic laparoscopy as only reusable products are used.","1095":"","1096":"","1097":"The use of external fixation has been described for various conditions but has never become a popular technique in spine surgery. The objective of this study is to describe the successful application of external fixation of the spine in three cases of complex spine infection. The first case is a 51-year-old male with T2-T3 spinal osteomyelitis secondary to Actinomyces lung infection causing epidural abscess and signs of cord compression. Laminectomy and debridement of the epidural abscess was performed, and external fixation was applied percutaneously spanning C7-T5. The second case is an 18-year-old soldier with a gunshot wound to the abdominal cavity with small bowel perforation and fracture of L1 and L2. Retroperitoneal infection developed at this level and was drained percutaneously. External fixation of T10-L4 was performed. The third case is a 60-year-old male who underwent resection of a locally invasive lung tumor at T3. Postoperative CSF leak and widespread infection was noted, mandating debridement and removal of the infected hardware. External fixation of T1-T8 was applied for temporary stabilization. All patients tolerated the procedure well, and rapid ambulation and physical therapy was initiated. Under broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, resolution of infection was noted in all three cases as well as good sagittal and coronal axis alignment on follow-up imaging. We conclude that external fixation of the spine is a safe and effective surgical technique that can be considered as salvage treatment for spinal infections accompanied by segmental spinal instability.","1098":"Degenerated spinal disc and spinal stenosis are common problems requiring decompressive spinal surgery. Traditional open spinal discectomy is associated with significant tissue trauma, greater morbidity\/complications, scarring, often longer term of convalescence, and even destabilization of the spine. Therefore, the pursuit of less traumatic minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) began. The trend of spinal surgery is rapidly moving toward MISS. MISS is a technologically dependent surgery, and requires increased utilization of advanced endoscopic surgical instruments, imaging-video technology, and tissue modulation technology for performing spinal surgery in a digital operating room (DOR). It requires seamless connectivity and control to perform the surgical procedures in a precise and orchestrated manner. A new integrated DOR, the technological convergence and control system SurgMatix(R), was created in response to the need and to facilitate MISS with \"organized control instead of organized chaos\" in the endoscopic OR suite. It facilitates the performance, training, and further development of MISS.","1099":"Despite the advancement of surgical techniques in endoscopic spine surgeries, treatment of central and paracentral disc herniations, especially disc extrusions and disc sequestrations, remains challenging. On the basis of our experience with treating disc tears, disc herniations, and other spinal diseases, we have developed a new technique we call the \"between\" technique. This technique involves positioning the opening of the endoscope access cannula at the edge of the targeted disc with half of the opening being positioned inside the disc and the other half positioned in the epidural space. The \"between\" technique uses a blunt-ended dilator as a navigating tool in the epidural space to find the ideal access path and initial location for the access cannula. The technique is safe, effective, and easy to use. It has been proven particularly efficacious for the treatment of central and paracentral extruded disc herniations and sequestered disc herniations. The purpose of this Chapter is to describe this technique and introduce its application in removing central and paracentral disc extrusions and sequestrations.","1100":"Lisfranc injuries are not very common. Surgical options available for treatment of Lisfranc injuries have produced chronic pain and disability due to the damage to the articular surface, leading to early arthritis. We describe the technique of extra-articular fixation using dorsal plates for Lisfranc injury, avoiding any damage to the articular surface.","1101":"Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) retaining total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is bone conserving and relies on the retained ligament to provide posterior stability. PCL sacrifice allows for easier correction of deformity, a better range of motion, and predictable kinematics. It was hypothesized that using a novel single radius TKA design, coupled with a double-dished articular geometry, would yield satisfactory stability and outcomes by sacrificing the PCL without substitution. A consecutive series of 94 cemented Scorpio (Stryker Orthopaedics) single radius PCL retaining total knee arthroplasties using that strategy, with a minimum 8-year follow-up, is presented. An early return of range of motion and extensor mechanism function was also demonstrated. No cases of instability and no revisions related to the technique occurred. As predicted, clinical and radiographic outcomes were excellent regarding pain relief and functional activities.","1102":"Mobile-bearing unicompartmental knees facilitate decreased polyethylene wear and restoration of knee kinematics. The purpose of this study was to quantify tibial strains during bearing mobility in UKA. Composite tibiae were implanted with cemented metal-backed tibial components and coated with photoelastic material, allowing \"full-field\" strain analysis. A fully congruent mobile polyethylene bearing was loaded in six separate locations on the tibial tray, simulating bearing translation during knee motion. Strains were noted to be greatest in the anteromedial tibia, 2 cm distal to the joint line, which correlates with the area occasionally noted to have residual pain following UKA. This study demonstrates the important role that bearing movement plays in load distribution throughout the tibia after UKA and may illuminate a biomechanical process of tibial remodeling that influences pain and implant loosening.","1103":"A prospective study of 110 Corail(R) uncemented hemiarthroplasties performed for fresh femoral neck fractures in 110 patients was carried out. The patients were followed during 10 years, unless they died before. Mean patient age was 84 (63-99) years; 75% were women and 25% had mental impairment. Implantation was uneventful in all patients except 7 (6 calcar cracks and 1 major trochanter fracture). Full-weight-bearing was allowed in almost every uncomplicated case, with only one 9-mm subsidence explained by the use of an undersized implant. A comprehensive radiographic analysis was undertaken in 44 hemiarthroplasties with a minimal implantation time of five years. A constant pattern of radiologic changes was identified and described. No loosening was noted; however, 7 radiolucent lines were seen in Zone 1 and 3 in Zone VII. Results of this prospective survey indicated that the HA-coated Corail prosthesis produces favorable functional and radiological outcomes for these elderly and frail patients.","1104":"The The aim of our study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy through the identification of remarkable genes for the myocardial function that are expressed differently between diabetic and normal subjects. Moreover, we intend to characterize both in human myocardial tissue and in the related cardiac progenitor cells the pattern of gene expression and the levels of expression and protein activation of molecular effectors involved in the regulation of the myocardial function and differentiation to clarify whether in specific human pathological conditions (type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiac failure, coronary artery disease) specific alterations of the aforementioned factors could take place. Thirty-five patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or for aortic or mitral valve replacement were recruited into the study. There were 13 men and 22 women with a mean age of 64.8 +\/- 13.4 years. A list of anamnestic, anthropometric, clinical, and instrumental data required for an optimal phenotypical characterization of the patients is reported. The small cardiac biopsy specimens were placed in the nourishing buffer, in a sterile tube provided the day of the procedure, to maintain the stability of the sample for several hours at room temperature. The cells were isolated by a dedicated protocol and then cultured in vitro. The sample was processed for total RNA extraction and levels of gene expression and protein activation of molecular effectors involved in the regulation of function and differentiation of human myocardium was analyzed. In particular, cardiac genes that modulate the oxidative stress response or the stress induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines (p66Shc, SOCS-1, SOCS-3) were analyzed. From a small sample of myocardium cardiac stem cells and cardiomyoblasts were also isolated and characterized. These cells showed a considerable proliferative capacity due to the fact that they demonstrate stability up to the eleventh passage. Analysis of gene expression in a subgroup of subjects showed the trend of a decrease in levels of expression of cardiac-specific transcription genes and oxidative stress-related proteins in tissues of diabetic patients compared with controls subjects. This trend is not confirmed in isolated cells. As for the coronary artery disease, diabetic cardiomyopathy could be associated with a reduction of the cardiac stem and progenitor cells pool. The expansion of the cardiac resident cells pool could be associated with a preservation of cardiac performance, suggesting that a preserved stamina compartment can counteract the impact of diabetes on the myocardium.","1105":"Aortic injury from sudden deceleration is the most common traumatic condition of the thoracic aorta encountered clinically. Open surgical repair is still associated today with a high-risk setting. Recently, stent-graft treatment is emerging as an alternative to conventional surgery due to its less traumatic nature in patients affected by traumatic aortic lesions, especially in concomitance with multiple associated lesions. From March 1999 to June 2009, 57 patients admitted with a diagnosis of acute and chronic aortic lesions underwent endovascular repair. In 38 cases, traumatic aortic rupture was detected in the acute phase and associated lesions were present at various grade in all patients, whereas in 19 cases aortic injury was identified in the chronic phase. The endovascular treatment was successful in all cases affected both by acute and chronic aortic injury. None of the patients died during the follow-up, as well as no cases of perigraft leakage have been detected so far. Endovascular repair represents the first choice of treatment in patients with traumatic aortic lesions. Indeed, the severity of co-existing lesions could be adversely affected by conventional surgical treatment, also with consideration of its high morbidity rate due to thoracotomy.","1106":"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a truly minimally invasive technique allowing for off-pump aortic valve implantation in selected high-risk patients. Potential advantages are the avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamping, and sternotomy. Feasibility has been proven for a retrograde transfemoral, retrograde trans-subclavian, and antegrade trans-apical approach. Superiority of one of these delivery routes is as yet unproven. Given the excellent outcome following conventional aortic valve replacement even in octogenarians and the lack of prospectively randomized trials proving the effectiveness of TAVI, this new innovative technique should be restricted to selected high-risk patients at present. Nevertheless, TAVI has already evolved into a routine procedure in selected specialized centers providing a safe and reproducible treatment option for high-risk elderly patients suffering from severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.","1107":"One of the treatments of malignancy of low genital tract is local pelvic radiation. However, in premenopausal it is associated with premature ovarian failure. Ovarian transposition is a technique to avoid radiation damage to the ovaries. The authors report robotic-assisted ovarian transposition in a 39-year-old woman with stage II-b cervical cancer. The ovaries were transposed to the ipsilateral paracolic gutter and secured to the anterior-lateral peritoneum using a disposable fixation device.","1108":"During the total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) operation, small changes in the uterine and vaginal cuff position, provided by an adequate manipulator, may optimize the attack angles to the vulnerable structures involved during the procedure and facilitate their dissection. The uterine manipulators are effective because they raise the uterus when moving it from one place to another, leaving the fixing elements on tension. The Lopez-Zepeda uterine manipulator exposes all the anatomic structures involved in TLH, especially those in the vulnerable areas. It avoids dissection and mobilization of the bladder and therefore its innervation. It takes the ureter away from the risky area by 4 cm. to 5 cm. decreasing the injury risk. Finally, thanks to its anteflexion and anteversion movement, it puts the posterior culdotomy area further away from the ureter, the rectum and the sigmoid colon.","1109":"This was a prospective study of postmenopausal women who underwent a computerized tomography (CT) examination of the abdomen and pelvis. We evaluated the location of the aortic bifurcation and transverse colon relative to the umbilicus at midline axis. Of 66 women, 24 were of normal weight, 23 were classified as overweight, and 19 as obese. The ages of the women in all groups were comparable. In the normal weight and overweight women, the mean location of the umbilicus was 0.6 cm +\/- 0.4 cm and 0.4 cm +\/- 0.3 cm cranial to the aortic bifurcation, respectively, and in obese women its mean location was 1.4 cm +\/- 0.5 cm caudal to the aortic bifurcation. In approximately half of the normal weight and overweight women, the umbilicus was located cranial to the aortic bifurcation, and in 62.2% of obese women it was located caudal to the aortic bifurcation. Compared to those with normal weight (0.3 cm +\/- 1.1 cm), the distance between umbilicus and transverse colon was greater in overweight (4.5 cm +\/- 1.2 cm) and obese women (7.1 cm +\/- 0.7 cm). In approximately one third of the normal weight women and over half of the overweight women, the umbilicus was located caudal to the transverse colon. In contrast, the umbilicus in 84.2% of the obese women was located caudal to transverse colon. There was a linear correlation between the distance of umbilicus and transverse colon distance and body mass index (BMI; r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.0001). Regardless of the BMI, there was a wide variability whether the umbilicus was cranial or caudal to the aortic bifurcation or transverse colon. Similar to that in reproductive-aged women, in postmenopausal women the location of the aortic bifurcation and transverse colon varies. Proper insertion of the Veress needle and trocar is more important than a particular angle of insertion.","1110":"Neurophysiological investigations and neurosurgical procedures of the sacral plexus are not especially well developed, because the sacral plexus is difficult to access. Awareness that sacral radiculopathies may exist is still lacking and the incidence of these pathologies is widely underestimated. Since the recent introduction of laparoscopy in the field of pelvic nerves, the situation has changed considerably: laparoscopy not only permits a precise morphological and functional exploration of the entire sacral plexus, but also offers new therapeutic options: In lesions to the sacral nerve roots by compression, infiltration, or surgical damages, the laparoscopy offers an adequate access for micro-neurosurgical procedures; whereas in neurogenic pathologies or situations of failure of neurosurgical treatments, the technique of laparoscopic implantation of a neuroprosthesis - the LION procedure - permits the neuromodulation of all sacral nerve roots in different combination with only one electrode for simultaneous control of pelvic\/lower limb pain and pelvic visceral dysfunctions. Regarding the dramatically increased incidence of sacral radiculopathies, especially secondary to pelvic prolaps surgeries by blind mesh-material implantation, this field of pathologies has to come in the focus of medical interests. Also, physicians involved in pelvic pathologies\/surgeries have to be trained in clinical neuropelveology.","1111":"Burst abdomen is a postoperative complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The risk factors for burst abdomen are patient- and surgery-related. The management of this complication is a relatively unexplored area within the field of surgery. Relevant surgical outcomes include recurrence, mortality, and incisional hernia. A total number of 27 studies are identified that reported on at least one surgical outcome (recurrence, mortality, or incisional hernia rate) of at least 10 patients with burst abdomen. None of the identified studies were designed prospectively, and only a minority of studies reported surgical outcomes of considerable numbers of patients with burst abdomen. Reported conservative management options included use of saline-soaked gauze dressings and negative pressure wound therapy. Operative management options included temporary closure options (open abdomen treatment), primary closure with various suture techniques, closure with application of relaxing incisions, use of synthetic (nonabsorbable and absorbable) and biological meshes, and the use of tissue flaps. The treatment of burst abdomen is associated with unsatisfactory surgical outcome. Randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to provide the surgical community with a greater level of evidence for the optimal treatment strategy for burst abdomen and the various subtypes.","1112":"Prosthetic material composition is implicated in the phenomenon of postoperative chronic groin pain that has undermined elective open inguinal herniorrhaphy. Reported herein are our 'all-comers' experiences with a novel dual component mesh (4DDome(R)). A prospective cohort (Phase II) study was performed that involved all patients undergoing elective open inguinal herniorrhaphy during a four-year period. Conventional operative technique was used except for choice of prosthesis. The 4DDome mesh comprises a molded dome-shaped composite (10% polypropylene, 90% poly-L-lactic acid) with a lightweight polypropylene mesh overlay. Short- (1 week) and intermediate-term (18 months) clinical follow-up with examination and symptom questionnaire judged outcome while surgeons rated their approval using a visual analogue scale. One hundred ninety-six patients (mean age, 65.5 years; Mean BMI, 25.5; Mean ASA, 1.8, 178 males) underwent repair of 201 inguinal hernias by six surgeons (three residents). The majority of patients had an indirect hernia (n=119) 93 being combined with a posterior wall defect [Nyhus IIIa], whereas 66 had a direct hernia [Nyhus IIIb], and 11 had a recurrent hernia.) Mean operative time was 44.6 minutes with 92 patients being operated under local anesthesia. Ten patients developed seromas and two had hematomas early postoperatively. Median intermediate-term follow-up is currently 19 (range: 3-72) months for the 147 (75%) patients still available for contact. The incidence of chronic groin pain is 8.8%, whereas there has been one hernia recurrence. Surgeon satisfaction and confidence were high. The 4DDome provides appropriate clinical results and, therefore, appears valid for use in routine practice.","1113":"Surgical treatment of umbilical and small ventral hernias ranges from a simple suture repair to the placement of large intra-abdominal or retromuscular meshes. Several articles report a lower incidence of recurrence after mesh repair, whether this is positioned onlay, retromuscular, or intraperitoneally. Often, a simple suture repair fails in the longterm, whereas a laparoscopic or retromomuscular approach seems too extensive for these rather small hernias. In between those two treatment options exists a go-between repair that carries the idea of posterior repair without being so aggressive in its approach. In this study, the authors examined a new device called the Proceed Ventral Patch (PVP) (Ethicon, Inc., Sommerville, NJ, USA). It is a self-expanding, partially absorbable, flexible laminate mesh device that allows an easy, quick and minimal invasive, tension-free, and standardized approach to umbilical hernia treatment. No data nor publication exist on this new device. Reported herein is our early and first experience with this novel technique.","1114":"The efficacy of prophylactic hemostasis with endoclips after polypectomy is still controversial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic hemostasis for postpolypectomy mucosal defects using endoclips under infrared imaging. Patients with colon polyps who were endoscopically treated at Jikei University Aoto Hospital were retrospectively reviewed to compare the delayed bleeding rate in the infrared imaging group with the conventional imaging group. A total of 813 colon polyps in 416 patients were endoscopically treated from July 2003 to November 2006. The overall postpolypectomy bleeding rate in the infrared imaging group was shown to be significantly lower than in the conventional imaging group. The postpolypectomy bleeding from the endoclip site was also significantly lower in the infrared imaging group than in the conventional imaging group. Even the number of applied endoclips was significantly fewer in the infrared group than the conventional group. The prophylactic use of endoclips with infrared imaging effectively reduced the postpolypectomy bleeding with fewer clip applications.","1115":"TThis study was conducted to compare the outcome of total thyroidectomy using novel hemostatic devices and the classic suture ligation technique. This prospective study included 195 consecutive patients undergoing total thyroidectomy between January 2008 and March 2009. The main outcomes measured were operating time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, pain score, and postoperative complications. The three groups tested were similar in terms of demographics, thyroid gland weight and pathology, and postoperative complications. According to two-way analysis of variance, the use of hemostatic devices in thyroid volume less than 40 ml was not found to significantly correlate with operating time, intraoperative blood loss or postoperative drainage. Novel hemostatic devices are safe, useful, and time-saving adjuncts for thyroid surgery, and the use of these devices seems to have great advantages in the patients with large goiters.","1116":"In the last three years, investigations on natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) have entered the clinical experimental phase. Our aim was to carry out the first cross-sectional survey in Hungary about inpatients and specialists' opinions concerning natural orifice surgery. A total of 155 patients were included in the survey from two hospitals. Patients received a handout that described in detail the various available techniques for cholecystectomy, plus a 10-item questionnaire. Respondents had to choose between undergoing laparoscopic or NOTES cholecystectomy, indicate the acceptable complication rate, provide the reason for their choice, and select an ideal orifice. Specialists attending lectures on NOTES at two Hungarian congresses were given a separate questionnaire that was designed for physicians. We measured their perceptions about the need for the new method and about the unsolved issues it involved, their choice of entry site, their assessment of which type of specialist should perform NOTES operations, and the timeframe that would be needed for the widespread adoption of the method. With complication rates presumed to be equivalent to each other, 53% of inpatients chose a NOTES operation over laparoscopy for a cholecystectomy. Those who had prior endoscopy (p = 0.03), prior open surgery (p = 0.03), or who were male (p = 0.05) were more likely to opt for NOTES. The preferred approach was transvaginal (49%) for women, and transcolonic (66%) for men. Regarding the specialists, 37% would like to use NOTES in their practice and 49% would undergo a NOTES procedure; of these, 43% were unable to indicate the ideal orifice, 22% preferred the vagina, 20% the stomach, and 15% a hybrid approach. A total of 54% of surgeons believed that there is a real demand for NOTES, whereas 37% felt that it is an unnecessary innovation.","1117":"Electrocautery remains the main energy form used for dissection in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, due to its many risks the search continues for safer and more efficient forms of energy. This chapter assesses the outcomes of dissection using ultrasonic energy as compared to monopolar electrocautery during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Studies included are trials of prospectively randomized adult patients with symptomatic gallstone disease subject either ultrasonic or monopolar electrocautery dissection during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Seven trials were included in this review, with a total patient number of 695 randomized to two dissection methods: 340 in the electrocautery group and 355 in the ultrasonic group. Ultrasonic dissection is shown to be superior to monopolar electrocautery in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Disadvantages include a difficult maneuvering technique and overall cost. Appropriate training programs may be implemented to overcome the first disadvantage, and it might be argued that given the combined cost of factors associated with standard clip and cautery technique, cost issues may be outweighed by the benefits of ultrasonic dissection. However, this necessitates further cost-benefit analysis.","1118":"We present a series of patients who have undergone laparo-endoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery for placement of an adjustable gastric band. From December 2007 to December 2008, LESS surgery to place an adjustable gastric band was performed via a trans-umbilical incision. Essentially, multiple ports were placed through a single incision in the umbilicus to allow for liver retraction, visualization, and working instruments. All critical steps using a standard pars flaccida technique were not altered. Twenty-two patients were carefully selected, including 20 women and 2 men ranging in age from 18 to 67 with a mean age of 42. All patients were discharged home within the 23-hour admission window, and there were no perioperative complications noted. In addition, there were no wound-related complications. LESS surgery for adjustable gastric band shows this technique to be both feasible and safe in selected patients to date. Although technical limitations exist that will undoubtedly be improved upon, further studies must be performed to compare LESS surgery for placement of an adjustable gastric band to traditional laparoscopic techniques.","1119":"The objective of this study was to achieve an ideal cosmetic result and minimize the access trauma to the abdominal wall. The authors developed a technique to perform cholecystectomies and appendectomies with only one incision in the umbilicus. With the upcoming idea of Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) in the recent years and noticing the lack of feasibility of the technique for the daily routine beside the technique described by these authors, another development was raising the interest of the surgeons around the world. The single-access surgery through the umbilicus is a technique, that can be used in the daily routine and provides the best cosmetic results. Furthermore, injury of the abdominal wall is located at only one site, which might reduce the rate of trocar hernias and abdominal wall infections. Two 5.5-mm trocars were inserted through an incision at the upper edge of the umbilicus. After perforation of the abdominal wall with a stylet of a 5.5-mm trocar, a curved grasper was inserted, without the use of a trocar, into the abdominal cavity. The use of curved instruments facilitates better triangulation and instrument handling. No gas leakage was observed due to the nonexistence of a trocar. Dissection of the Calot' s triangle or appendix vessels can be done with standard instruments. The curved grasper allows retraction of the gallbladder or appendix. The specimen can be removed through the umbilical incision. The authors present a single-access surgery technique for cholecystectomies and appendectomies using curved instruments. The single-access surgery with parallel inserted curved instruments is feasible. No additional complications are related to this modification other than those known to be associated with laparoscopic surgery. This method offers an almost scarless surgery. Whether other advantages such as less trocar hernias, wound infections, and\/or a faster recovery can be achieved, it has not yet to be proven.","1120":"The aim of the study was to determine if the concept of face and construct validity may apply to the SurgicalSim Educational Platform (SEP) \"robot\" simulator. The SEP robot simulator is a virtual reality (VR) simulator aiming to train users on the Da Vinci Surgical System. To determine the SEP's face validity, two questionnaires were constructed. First, a questionnaire was sent to users of the Da Vinci system (reference group) to determine a focused user-group opinion and their recommendations concerning VR-based training applications for robotic surgery. Next, clinical specialists were requested to complete a pre-tested face validity questionnaire after performing a suturing task on the SEP robot simulator. To determine the SEP's construct validity, outcome parameters of the suturing task were compared, for example, relative to participants' endoscopic experience. Correlations between endoscopic experience and outcome parameters of the performed suturing task were tested for significance. On an ordinal five-point, scale the average score for the quality of the simulator software was 3.4; for its hardware, 3.0. Over 80% agreed that it is important to train surgeons and surgical trainees to use the Da Vinci. There was a significant but marginal difference in tool tip trajectory (p = 0.050) and a nonsignificant difference in total procedure time (p = 0.138) in favor of the experienced group. In conclusion, the results of this study reflect a uniform positive opinion using VR training in robotic surgery. Concepts of face and construct validity of the SEP robotic simulator are present; however, these are not strong and need to be improved before implementation of the SEP robotic simulator in its present state for a validated training curriculum to be successful .","1121":"Brain tissue retraction is frequently required to reach deep intra-axial lesions, and the quest for an ideal retractor that would protect the underlying brain tissue continues. Despite the availability of multiple retractors, the incidence of brain retraction injury remains high and has been reported to be 5% to 10%. A recently developed transparent tubular retractor appears to provide several advantages in surgery for deep intra-axial tumors and intracerebral hematomas. We used a new commercially available transparent tubular retractor in 16 craniotomies. Fourteen of these patients were operated upon for deep tumors and cysts, including two intraventricular tumors and two for deep intracerebral hemorrhages. In all patients, the tubular retractor was directed toward the lesion through a small corticotomy and guided by a navigation system. Each lesion was completely removed through the retractor's lumen. In all cases, the tubular retractors provided excellent visualization of the underlying pathology and facilitated its surgical removal, dissection, and hemostasis. The tubular nature of the retractor allowed the rotation and changing the angle of approach without putting extra pressure on the brain tissue, which inevitably occurs when malleable or other ribbon-type retractors are used. There were no hematomas on routine postoperative CT scans in this series. Transparent tubular retractors provide a unique means of deep visualization and even force distribution at the retracted brain tissue. Although these retractors were originally designed for the removal of deep subcortical tumors, they may be used to access and evacuate intracerebral hematomas. In our experience, the use of tubular retractors allows one to achieve safe access to deep intracerebral lesions and decreases the rate of retraction-related complications.","1122":"In natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) using a single endoscope, the visual field moves unstably and a wide blind space is formed. We used wireless two wireless CCD cameras (270,000 and 380,000 pixels) placed on the abdominal wall of pigs and a conventional endoscope (410,000 pixels) at the same time to assess whether it was possible to observe the entire process of sigmoidectomy by NOTES. The titanium dioxide-coated lens was used as an antifogging apparatus. To control the CCD image frames, a magnetic body was affixed to the back of the CCD camera unit. To select a suitable visual-transmitter, three frequency bands were assessed: 0.07 GHz, 1.2 GHz, and 2.4 GHz. The cameras showed good performance for monitoring all procedures of the sigmoidectomy. The magnetic force most suitable to control the cameras was found to be 360 mT, and the best transmission frequency was 1.2 GHz. The battery could be used for up to 4 hours with intermittent use. The issue of lens fogging could be resolved by a water supply into the anal canal and a more than 12-hour ultraviolet irradiation. We verified that the CCD camera with the titanium dioxide-coated lens may be useful as the second eye in NOTES.","1123":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy during thyroidectomy is associated with multiple risk factors as patient- and surgeon-related bailiff. The risk is greater for thyroid cancer, Graves' disease, re-operation, and mediastinal goiter in less experienced centers and in patients in whom the RLN could not be identified during operation. Anatomical landmarks exist to identify RLN. Nevertheless, transient and permanent RLN injuries still exist. Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) has been introduced to facilitate identification and verify functional integrity of the RLN in thyroid surgery. In this chapter, we present relevant medical literature and personal experience on thyroid surgery with IONM. Technical, medical, and legal aspects of monitoring are discussed.","1124":"Laparoscopy has gained a place in everyday surgical routine as an alternative surgical approach that decreases morbidity and postoperative hospitalization. Single port laparoscopic surgery has been introduced as a further development of laparoscopy. The feasibility and safety of single port laparoscopy is under extensive evaluation in specialized laparoscopic centers. Nevertheless, wide acceptance of the technique requires adequate documentation of the advantages of the approach over conventional laparoscopy and further refinement of surgical instrumentation to overcome intraoperative ergonomic problems.","1125":"Access to the posterior inguinal wall is a fundamental part of inguinal hernia repair. The approach to the inguinal canal may affect the course and outcome of the operation. The aim of this study is to compare posterior approach (PA) repair with the standard anterior approach (AA). The study included 91 low-risk unilateral primary inguinal hernia patients who randomly received AA repair or PA repair. Various outcome measures in both groups were compared, and the mean operating time was longer for the AA repair group. Intra-operative complications were the same in both groups. Postoperative complications were more frequent in the AA repair group. The at-rest mean visual analog score (VAS), 24 hours postoperatively, seemed to be higher in the AA repair group. AA patients were able to postoperatively walk sooner than PA patients. Inguinal hernia repair through a PA seems to be less painful, less debilitating, and more easily applicable than the AA. Such advantages may be the reasons to select it as a standard procedure of choice.","1126":"Surgical correction is generally indicated as the primary form of management in children with severe early onset scoliosis. Even so, conservative, nonsurgical treatment is always considered first, as surgical correction carries significant concomitant consequences, including but not limited to crankshaft phenomenon and, more importantly, inhibition of further spine, lung, and chest growth in skeletally immature patients. Fusionless surgical procedures assuage some of these risks, as they are characteristically associated with techniques necessitating spinal fusion. One device looks particularly promising in treating and managing severe early onset scoliosis, the vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR)-a device that was initially targeted toward children with thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS). Despite its promising results in correction of severe early onset scoliosis, as well as associated rib and chest wall deformities, the VEPTR nevertheless has a complication rate comparable to other fusionless techniques. Continued modifications and research will hopefully beget a device that permits thoracic and spinal growth in skeletally immature patients yet with fewer postoperative complications. In this chapter, the authors review the clinical experience with VEPTR to date and present their results in 16 children with congenital scoliosis cared for at Shriners Hospital of Philadelphia.","1127":null,"1128":"Esophageal perforation after endoscopic instrumentation is a surgical emergency. Prompt diagnosis and treatment have a significant impact on mortality. In the setting of esophageal cancer, iatrogenic perforation presents a difficult challenge for surgical management as primary repair is not feasible. In this chapter, we describe the use of a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy for the management of an iatrogenic esophageal perforation in a patient with metastatic esophageal cancer.","1129":"Postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) represents a serious and potentially fatal complication that affects 40% to 60% of patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery and not receiving antithrombotic prophylaxis. Several prophylactic modalities, including pharmacological agents such as oral vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), have been shown to be effective and safe for most patients at high risk for VTE. However, some patients undergoing cancer or major orthopedic surgery remain at some residual VTE risk despite the use of these methods. Approaches to improve the results of prophylaxis include optimizing the timing and duration of pharmacological prophylaxis, combining mechanical methods with anticoagulants, and the development of new antithrombotics.","1130":null,"1131":null,"1132":"Conforming articulations potentially decrease polyethylene contact stresses in total knee arthroplasty (TKA); however, less is known about the effect of coronal geometry on tibial loading and clinical failure. This study examined the relationship between coronal plane geometry and loading patterns in the proximal tibia. Composite tibiae were implanted with modular, metal-backed tibial trays and were compressively loaded with conforming and nonconforming ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) tibial bearings and comparable femoral components. Changes in strain on the proximal tibia were quantified using a photoelastic strain analysis method. In balanced loading, coronally dished components created a strain increase in the anterior medial tibia while creating a significant strain decrease in the posterior tibia. Proximal tibial strains were decreased and centralized in conforming versus flat articulations. This centralization of loading may lead to a reduction in edge loading during gait. Lower strains were observed with coronally dished implants in key regions corresponding to the clinical overload of the tibia leading to aseptic loosening.","1133":"Over the past decade, the development of modified instrumentation and navigation assistance (permitting in-situ bone excision) have stimulated advances in minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty techniques. These techniques have been developed with an objective to reduce perioperative morbidity, hospitalization expenses, and total rehabilitation time. Furthermore, a concomitant increase in the promotion of these techniques by both industry and orthopaedic surgeons themselves has fueled patient demand. However, the most common minimally invasive techniques used require two incisions and either prevent or limit the surgeon's ability to directly visualize the bony structures of the hip. In this chapter, the authors present a case study that describes a single-incision, soft-tissue sparing, minimally invasive technique for total hip arthroplasty.","1134":"We report the early results of 10 consecutive metal-on-metal resurfacing arthroplasties performed between May 2006 and July 2007 in young, active patients with gross femoral head defects. Failure was classified as revision for any reason. The mean age of our cohort at the time of surgery was 42.8 years and the minimal period of follow-up was 6.9 months. No patients were lost to follow-up. Up to the time of last review, there were no failures and all patients have returned to their preoperative levels of activity. This study shows promising early results of a bone-conserving, hydroxyapatite-coated, uncemented metal-on-metal bearing prosthesis in young, active patients with bony defects of the femoral head.","1135":null,"1136":"Treatment for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) has progressed rapidly over the past ten years in the search for less invasive methods to treat this disease. There have been over 100 procedures described in the literature to date to treat female SUI; however, only two procedures have stood the test of time and have adequate cure rates: the retropubic colposuspension (Burch, MMK) and the sling. The laparoscopic approach to minimize the Burch procedure was described in the 1990s, but the evolution of the retropubic tension-free vaginal tape sling (TVT) in the late 1990s revolutionized the treatment of female SUI. More recently, the transobturator technique (TOT) and the single-incision mini-sling have been reported in attempts to further reduce the risks of sling placement. The current chapter reviews the history of treatment of female SUI and the development of these newer, less-invasive techniques. The procedures themselves are described, the risks of mesh complications reviewed, and the literature reviewed for current data on the different approaches and procedures.","1137":"Postoperative adhesions are a serious consequence of any type of intra-abdominal surgery and can result in infertility, pain, or bowel obstruction. Unfortunately, the paradox with adhesiolysis is that surgery performed to remove adhesions often results in further adhesion formation, so the problem persists and symptoms return and complications recur. Laparoscopic surgery with adherence to microsurgical techniques such as minimal tissue handling, rigorous attention to hemostasis, and copious irrigation was initially thought to minimize adhesion formation but such hopes have not been validated by clinical studies.","1138":null,"1139":"Access to the posterior inguinal wall is a fundamental part of inguinal hernia repair. The approach to the inguinal canal may affect the course and outcome of the operation. The aim of this study is to compare posterior approach (PA) repair with the standard anterior approach (AA). The study included 91 low-risk unilateral primary inguinal hernia patients who randomly received AA repair or PA repair. Various outcome measures in both groups were compared, and the mean operating time was longer for the AA repair group. Intra-operative complications were the same in both groups. Postoperative complications were more frequent in the AA repair group. The at-rest mean visual analog score (VAS), 24 hours postoperatively, seemed to be higher in the AA repair group. AA patients were able to postoperatively walk sooner than PA patients. Inguinal hernia repair through a PA seems to be less painful, less debilitating, and more easily applicable than the AA. Such advantages may be the reasons to select it as a standard procedure of choice.","1140":null,"1141":"Today's surgeon faces multiple decisions for each patient who presents with an inguinal hernia. The natural history of an untreated inguinal hernia is still unclear for a particular individual. Given the low risk of emergency and death from an inguinal hernia, observation alone is now becoming an acceptable approach for many. For those that desire or require repair, the age of the patient and their comorbidities will influence the choices of anesthetic and surgical technique. Despite our rapid advances in surgical technology, a consensus can not be reached locally or globally on one solution for inguinal hernia repair. Currently, more than six uniquely different surgical techniques are used for the repair of an inguinal hernia. Through the 1980s, the endpoint focused on by hernia surgeons was the incidence of recurrence. Though many experienced operators proved to have near-flawless results with a given technique, it has been difficult to duplicate these results by all surgeons. Over the past 10 years, there has been a greater emphasis on the prevention of postoperative pain and potential long-term mesh-related issues. Laparoscopic technique and the use of flat, lightweight mesh are showing promise in improving inguinal hernia repair results.","1142":null,"1143":"The treatment of neurogenic and traumatic fecal incontinence (FI) as may result from severe anal sphincteric destruction is problematic. A novel technique for the treatment of these cases is presented. The study comprised 44 patients, which included 28 with neurogenic and 16 with traumatic FI. Patients were divided into two equal groups. Two fascia lata slings (FLS) were applied in Group 1, while one sling was used in Group 2. Investigations comprised manometric and electromyographic studies. The procedure consisted of performing a curvilinear incision behind the anal orifice, and the supralevator region was entered. The middle of an FLS was sutured to the back of the upper part of anal canal. Each of the two limbs of the sling was passed forward through an incision on the pubic ramus and was sutured to the periosteum of the pubic ramus. This was preformed in Groups 1 and 2. A second FLS was added in Group 1. Its center was sutured to the front of the mid anal canal and its two limbs to the coccyx. Satisfactory results (continence scores 1 and 2) were obtained in 63.6% of Group 1 and 36.4% of Group 2. Significant postoperative anal pressure increase occurred in scores 1 to 3 in Group 1 and in scores 1 to 2 in Group 2. Anal pressure increase was more prominent in Group 1 than in Group 2. The continent effect of the operation appears to be due to the increase of anal pressure, anal canal elongation, and recto-anal angulation. The operation is indicated in FI of the idiopathic or traumatic type with excessive sphincteric loss. It is simple and easy and performed under no cover of colostomy.","1144":"Various techniques of stapled intestinal anastomoses are performed in gastroenterological surgery. Little is known about which technique is optimal. The intestines of a domestic pig were used in this study. Stapled intestinal anastomoses of three types-functional end-to-end anastomosis (FETEA), stapled side-to-end anastomosis (STEA), and stapled end-to-end anastomosis (EEA)-were constructed using pig intestines. The times for constructing anastomoses, length of the completed anastomosed intestine, strength of anastomoses, and bursting locations were measured and recorded on each group. The times required to construct FETEAs (60 S.D. 1.4 sec) were significantly less than those required for STEAs (191.5 S.D. 46.4 sec) and EEAs (274.5 S.D. 54.5 sec). The mean lengths of the completed anastomosed intestine were significantly different for FETEAs (89 S.D. 8.2 mm), STEAs (135 S.D. 6.1 mm), and EEAs (156 S.D. 6.5 mm). The bursting pressures were not significantly different among the three groups. FETEAs are superior in terms of requiring less surgical time. EEAs are superior in terms of the length of anastomosed intestines. In conclusion, anastomotic techniques should be selected properly in consideration of these features.","1145":"Neoadjuvant therapy has become the standard of care in locally advanced resectable rectal cancer. Increasingly, anti-angiogenic agents are incorporated into neoadjuvant therapy regimens. There is a need for the availability of biomarkers that allow one to select and monitor therapy. Functional imaging using dynamic MRI or PET in combination with mathematical modeling allows the monitoring of early vascular effects of therapy. In parallel, molecular imaging targeting a variety of tumor angiogenesis-associated moieties is under preclinical development. This chapter addresses the rationale, methods, and clinical data related to functional imaging of therapy response in rectal cancer.","1146":null,"1147":"Elective nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has gained general acceptance as an alternative to radical nephrectomy. To achieve hemostasis without risk of local ischemia and necrosis of kidney parenchyma after standard hemostatic suturing, we investigated oxidized cellulose hemostats' efficacy and safety as atraumatic hemostatic treatment and for the closure of a large parenchymal defect after kidney tumor resection. Our approach has been particularly helpful for repairing large and irregular renal parenchymal defects. This study demonstrates the use of oxidized cellulose hemostats is effective for rapid, hemostatic closure of the kidney in association with partial nephrectomy.","1148":"Theoretically, robotic surgery is likely to overcome the intrinsic limitations of laparoscopic surgery, such as a view not under the direct surgeon's control, two-dimensional imaging, and limited motion of instruments. In this chapter, the preliminary experience with a robotic laparoscopic surgery system in the Surgical Department of the Alessandria Hospital, Italy, is reported. From November 2005 to August 2007, a total of 162 laparoscopic robotic operations were performed, in which robotic surgery was found to be feasible and safe. It takes a longer time than standard laparoscopy but seems able to reduce the need of a steep learning curve.","1149":"Although lasers have been used in clinical neurosurgery for over 40 years, technological advancements have expanded their use and improved technical application. Originally applied to brain tumors to confer destructive oncolysis, lasers have been used over the last few decades to incise, fenestrate, and repair tissues and now are being used for cerebrovascular bypass techniques. In this chapter, a brief history on the evolution of lasers in neurosurgery will be discussed, and technical and clinical aspects of current applications will presented. Such applications include: laser scalpel for spinal cord tumors and lipomas, fenestration of arachnoid cysts, cerebrovascular bypass with the ELANA device, laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy for brain tumors, laser tissue soldering for dural repair, and percutaneous laser disc decompression.","1150":"In contrast with autographic or allographic repair materials, the use of a xenographic soft tissue repair material could improve patient outcomes following surgery, since such a material would not require a second surgical site and could reduce the risk of human-to-human disease transmission. Veritas(c) Collagen Matrix (Veritas) is a novel, non-crosslinked soft tissue repair material derived from bovine pericardium. Physical property testing shows this material is strong, malleable, of uniform thickness, and easily sutureable. Biocompatibility testing, as well as viral safety and extractable deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) studies demonstrate the acellularity, safety, and immunological inertness of the material. Animal studies in pigs and rabbits, in a variety of surgical procedures that include abdominal wall implant, unilateral hysterectomy, urethral sling implant, and dural substitute studies demonstrate Veritas does not adhere readily to tissues of the chest wall or abdomen under conditions that promote adhesions. In addition, these studies show that Veritas is remodelable and, in time, becomes histologically indistinguishable from the host tissue. These findings indicate Veritas is an ideal soft tissue repair material and it may serve as an ideal scaffold for tissue engineering.","1151":"This chapter proposes a classification of surgical assistance systems with respect to their type and level of automation. This classification is based on previous work in the field of human factors and takes two aspects into consideration, the type of information-processing function of the surgeon that is supported by the system, as well as the type of function allocation between surgeon and systems. With respect to the former, three basic functions are distinguished, referred to as information acquisition and analysis, decision making and planning, and execution of surgical action. With respect to the type of function allocation, the status of being either \"passive\" or \"active\" comes into consideration for both objects of reference (i.e. the surgeon and the machine), depending on whether a given function is mainly performed by the surgeon, by the system, or collaboratively by both. Hence, a classification results for intraoperative assistance systems in six categories, each of these representing a different degree of automation. The classification scheme is explained and illustrated on the basis of examples of surgical assistance systems from various fields.","1152":"Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is currently an intensely discussed topic. The debate is extremely controversial, ranging from euphoric visions to complete refusal, and the future clinical role of natural orifice surgery is difficult to describe. This chapter analyzes the current technological status, and addresses the question of whether to enrich the surgical procedures will become an option. A literature research was undertaken using Medline and Pubmed. Personal experiences and communications were also included in this state-of-the-art report. The individual barriers currently impeding the clinical use, as defined by the NOSCAR group, are addressed in detail. With the exception of the vaginal access, no natural orifice-entering technique is already clinically mature. The selective use-potentially in combination-in a more refined technique than currently, is likely to provide a breakthrough. Most of the remaining obstacles are just a matter of further progress in advanced medical engineering. However, it should not be forgotten that the problems to be solved are less than trivial, and close cooperation between engineers and surgeons is essential. NOTES is still in the early stages of development. Currently available tools and techniques remain in the pioneer stage. However, worldwide activities in research and development will lead to promising solutions, which certainly will help to overcome the existing barriers. Whether \"pure NOTES\" or hybrid procedures only, surgery will take another step forward toward a less-invasive discipline.","1153":null,"1154":"Until relatively recently, few procedures have been developed that restore significant motor and sensory function in individuals with obsolete (ie, chronic), complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Building upon the methodology used to treat brachial root avulsion, the authors have developed peripheral nerve-rerouting procedures that have restored some function in hundreds of patients with such SCI. Many of the treated patients have regained life-enhancing function depending upon their injury level, such as walking with assistive devices, partial hand function, urination, sexual sensation, etc. Although sophisticated surgeries, the basic concept is theoretically simple: a functional nerve from above the injury site is rerouted and connected to a paralysis-affected peripheral nerve below the injury site. This Chapter summarizes more than a dozen rerouting procedures, which restore function that range from breathing to toe sensation. This summary discusses the indications and criteria for choosing the best donor nerve based on the specific injury level, and emphasizes major procedural features such as the use of selected interfascicular anastomosis, modified end-to-side suture techniques, vascularized donor nerves, a muscle trigger for the synchronized contraction of congenerous muscles, and reconstruction procedures to restore donor-nerve function.","1155":"The risk of perioperative complications while adopting minimally invasive spine surgery techniques may slow the acceptance of this technology. We assess the perioperative complication rate with minimally invasive single- and two-level interbody fusions and compare this incidence with a contemporaneous cohort of open single- and two-level open interbody fusions, with all procedures completed by a single surgeon in a single practice group. We compiled all open and MIS interbody fusion cases completed during the study period. Sofamor-Danek X-Tube and Stryker Luxor minimally invasive systems were used on all patients. Medical records were reviewed to assess any adverse events occurring in the perioperative period. Care was taken to include all medical and surgical adverse events and complications occurring within 30 days of surgery. Over the study period, 28 minimally invasive lumbar fusions were identified: 24 single- and 4 two-level cases. Both TLIF and PLIF techniques were used. This cohort was compared with a group of 19 single- and two-level open interbody fusion cases completed over the same period. The complication rate for the MIS cohort was 18%, with 7 complications occurring in 5 patients. In the open group, 8 complications occurred in 7 patients, an incidence of 37%. A standard distribution of complications occurred, and the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Limiting our analysis to severe complications yielded rates of 7% and 21% for the two groups, also not significantly divergent. Perioperative complications are not more common in well-selected MIS patients. Allowing for proper patient selection, MIS techniques have a favorable complication profile.","1156":"The anterior endoscopic cervical microdecompression (AECM) of disc and foramen with added application of nonablative lower holmium laser energy for disc shrinkage (laser thermodiskoplasty) has proven to be safe, less traumatic, easier, and more efficacious than conventional methods with significant economic savings. It preserves spinal motion and provides a channel for spinal arthroplasty. It is an effective alternative or replacement for conventional open cervical spinal surgery for discectomy, and can decompress spinal stenosis and degenerative spine conditions.","1157":"This chapter evaluates the current evidence on common minimally invasive therapeutic spinal procedures based on the Levels of Evidence and Grades of Recommendation developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (Oxford, United Kingdom). The results of the evaluation of current clinical evidence allow the following recommendations to be made: epidural adhesiolysis performed repeatedly every 3 months to 4 months is effective in the \"post lumbar laminectomy\" syndrome; epidural steroid injections may provide only short-term relief from pain in lumbar radiculopathy but have no long-term effect; selective nerve root injections of corticosteroids have no therapeutic effect on the long-term natural history of radiculopathy symptoms; intra-articular facet joint injections of corticosteroids have no therapeutic effect on lower back pain (grade of recommendation: A). Furthermore, percutaneous vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty provide immediate pain relief from osteoporotic spinal fractures but no significant long-lasting benefit (grade of recommendation: B). Finally, there is limited evidence (grade of recommendation: C) of the value of medial branch (facet) neurotomy, sacroiliac joint injection of steroids, and intradiscal electrothermal therapy, as well as of the advantages of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy over open microdiscectomy. As the level of evidence is generally low, more prospective randomized-controlled studies are needed to establish the value of the considered methods.","1158":"This study directly compared a minimally invasive dual-incision muscle-sparing surgical technique with a standard posterolateral approach in total hip arthroplasty to assess for early complications, clinical success, and alignment. Total hip arthroplasties using a minimally invasive, muscle-sparing, dual-incision approach were performed on 21 hips (20 patients). This cohort was compared to a contemporaneously performed group of 21 hips (20 patients) using a standard posterolateral approach. Five complications were reported for the dual-incision group versus one complication for the posterolateral group. Postoperative radiographic alignment of the prosthesis was closer to optimal for the posterolateral group. The dual-incision group had longer operating times and a significant increase in complications. The authors have discontinued the use of this technique based on the results of this study.","1159":"Midflexion instability is a new concept associated with revision total knee arthroplasty. It appears as rotational instability with combined external rotation and valgus stress in a knee flexed between 45 degrees and 90 degrees. Three main factors contribute to this instability: anterior medial collateral ligament attenuation, femoral-tibial articular geometry, and tibial post-femoral box geometry. Rotational stress should be included when assessing stability intraoperatively to identify those patients who may require additional constraint.","1160":"In this chapter, we review current techniques employed to decrease blood loss and describe the effective use of a unique bipolar electrocautery device in a patient with neuromuscular scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF). The reduction of blood loss and subsequent elimination of allogeneic blood transfusion is a desired outcome in all surgeries and is a major concern during PSF. In the child or adolescent with neuromuscular scoliosis, this becomes a greater concern due to a variety of factors such as the inability of the musculature to compress blood vessels, extensive surgical exposure, and the duration of the operation. A multitude of pharmacological, anesthetic, and surgical techniques-including preoperative autologous blood donation and human recombinant erythropoietin, intraoperative blood salvage techniques, and topical and systemic hemostatic agents-are employed to reduce the need for transfusion. Many of these techniques carry their own risks and, thus far, a systematic approach has not been established to decrease the need for transfusion. In the continued pursuit of reducing intraoperative blood loss, other surgical techniques must be developed.","1161":"Previous studies have shown that the accuracy of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) via computed tomography (CT) free systems is useful when applied in the clinical realm. However, few studies have compared CAS systems to the current gold standard, manually applied measuring guides. Thirty total knee arthroplasties (TKA) were performed on artificial Sawbones knees using three different navigational systems. The TKAs were performed by a fellowship-trained joint reconstruction surgeon as well as a third- and a fourth-year orthopedic resident to assess differences in performance with regard to surgical experience. Using a two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), no statistical differences were found in the accuracy of each of the three CAS navigational systems. Similarly, no differences were found between the accuracy of CAS systems and the gold standard measuring method. No differences in performance were found between the orthopedic residents and the fellowship-trained surgeon, suggesting a relatively small learning curve and usability. Definitive assessment of the clinical efficacy should be further assessed in a cadaveric study or, ideally, by way of a randomized clinical trial.","1162":"The pharmacological treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) has proven to be wholly inadequate. Although highly successful, the surgical approach is too invasive and has not been widely adopted. Progress has been made with breathtaking speed over the last decade toward the creation of an ablative surgical procedure that retains a high cure rate yet solves the problem of invasiveness. This chapter will describe a procedure that uses microwave energy delivered via a thin, long, and flexible catheter through endoscopic ports to treat AF. As energy delivery methods, surgical techniques, and assessment procedures continue to improve, treatments such as this one will hopefully attract the largest number of patients who suffer with this arrhythmia to seek a safe and effective cure.","1163":"In 2001, we described a new surgical technique of surgical ventricular restoration (SVR) in severe heart failure by papillary muscle re-alignment and volume reduction. This procedure has been offered in our institution to patients with severely impaired left ventricular function. Here we examine our mid-term results and also compare them with a similar cohort of patients who had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) only. Between 1998 and 2005, 30 patients underwent SVR by papillary muscle realignment with coronary artery revascularization at our institution. A subset of 20 patients had their left ventricular volume measured by echocardiogram and MRI scan, and a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed before and after the operation. An unselected consecutive cohort of patients with matching age, gender, and hemodynamic status who underwent CABG only without SVR was tested using the same protocol and the results were compared. We noticed that there was a significant advantage for patients who had additional SVR over patients who had CABG only. The observed improvement in those who had SVR may be due to reduced metabolic mismatch as a result of reduced wall tension and normalization of the apical twist of the left ventricle. We believe this would provide a form of surgical treatment for heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy at a time of reduced donor organ availability for transplant.","1164":"Aortic root replacement is the procedure of choice for patients with ascending aortic aneurysms and diseased aortic valve leaflets. The increasing age of patients who undergo aortic root surgery, and data that support the use of a biological aortic valve in the younger population, have significantly increased the need for a composite biological valved conduit. The third-generation Triplextrade (Terumo Vascutek, Renfrewshire, Scotland, UK) Dacron conduit with its three-layer technology, can be stored in glutaraldehyde along with biological prostheses while maintaining a complete blood impermeability. As the result of this fundamental improvement, the ready-to-use composite biological valved graft is currently available for the first time in different sizes, which avoids the need of assembling it on the surgical table. The procedure is expedited and a better hemostasis achieved because of the intrinsic characteristics of the new three-layered conduit. The BioValsalva (Terumo Vascutek, Renfrewshire, Scotland, UK) has been obtained by suturing a stentless aortic valve (Elan, Kohler, Leeds, UK) inside a Triplex Valsalva graft and combining the advantages of a biological valved conduit with the advantages of better leaflets dynamics, less tension on coronary ostia, and improved coronary flow proper of the Valsalva conduit. The authors' preliminary clinical experience with the BioValsalva is reported herein and the technique is discussed.","1165":"With the advent of new technology, it is crucial to understand the mechanics of how instruments work to fully be able to utilize them and prevent injury. One of the cornerstones which makes laparoscopy possible is the use of vessel sealing instruments. Cutting, coagulation, and dissection are some paramount qualities of vessel sealing instruments; however, knowledge of the type of energy being used on tissue is of utmost importance. The various forms of energy vessel sealing instruments have advantages and disadvantages depending on the task. In the following text, monopolar, bipolar, and ultrasonic vessel sealing instruments for laparoscopic surgery are discussed at length. From how these instruments work to their cost, a detailed look at the available and most widely used laparoscopic vessel sealing instruments is reviewed. The accompanying illustrations are to aid in recognition and understanding of their use.","1166":"Laparoscopic removal is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for dermoid tumors. However, the spillage of dermoid content with the laparoscopic approach is very high compared to laparotomy. The potential malignancy of dermoid tumors and the rare, but difficult to treat, chemical peritonitis in cases of spillage of dermoid content should lead to an adaptation of procedures during an endoscopic operation on a dermoid tumor to comply with the precautions of the \"open\" technique. Lift-laparoscopy combines laparoscopy with the standard procedures of laparotomy and thus may help reduce the spillage of dermoid contents. In a retrospective study of 108 patients with dermoid tumors, the frequency of the rupture of a dermoid tumor during a lift-laparoscopic operation was examined. Among the 79 cases of organ-preserving treatment, there were only three cases (3.8%) where a rupture of the dermoid capsule occurred. Even in cases of ruptures, it was possible to avoid spillage by closing the lesion with a clamp and continue the enucleation of the dermoid tumor during a lift-laparascopic operation. After thorough abdominal cavity lavage, none of these three cases showed a cytological contamination of the abdominal cavity with dermoid cells. None of the ovariectomy or adnexectomy cases showed a rupture. Histologically, there was also no carcinoma in any of the examined dermoid tumors. By adapting the endoscopic dermoid surgery to the precautions established in an open surgery technique using gasless lift-laparoscopy, ruptures and cell spilling can be avoided to a large extent but not completely excluded. Compared with other methods, the number of ruptures and spillage of dermoids by organ-preserving treatment as well as ovariectomy is lowest using a lift-laparoscopic procedure.","1167":"Sacral colpopexy is the gold standard for vaginal vault suspension throughout the literature. The operation is considered to be invasive yet very effective. The laparoscopic approach to the sacral colpopexy is not only effective but can have minimal morbidity in the correct surgeon's hands. The authors have performed more than 500 sacral colpopexy via laparoscopy with minimal morbidity and thus share their technique with the reader.","1168":"A61-year-old postmenopausal woman with ovarian carcinoma was treated with two surgical operations and a series of platinum-based chemotherapy. A solitary metastasis into the splenic parenchyma was identified 33 months after the second surgery by abdominal computed tomography with an increased serum level of CA-125. She underwent a pancreaticosplenectomy and received platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy continuously for 2 years. Her serum CA-125 level decreased to a normal range and she has lived without any recurrence for more than 10 years after the splenectomy. Solitary metastases from ovarian cancer into the splenic parenchyma are extremely rare. Among 18 cases previously reported, this present case shows the longest disease-free survival. Because these cases show favorable prognosis after splenectomy, surgical treatment should be considered along with adjuvant chemotherapy.","1169":"The LAPMAN (Medsys, Gembloux, BELGIUM) is a dynamic laparoscope holder guided by a joystick clipped onto the laparoscopic instruments under the index finger of the operator. It confers optimal control of the visual field while operating, ensures stable and smooth displacement of the laparoscope, and allows the operator to work in conditions of restricted surgical assistance, due to either unavailability of staff or economic constraints. It has been tested successfully in pilot studies in laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.","1170":null,"1171":"This study is a retrospective chart review comparing 195 women who underwent rectocele repair with either a porcine dermal xenograft or human allogenic cadaveric dermal graft augmentation over a two year period. A site-specific defect repair was completed prior to augmentation with the graft. Examinations were performed preoperatively and postoperatively using the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system. Questionnaires were used to assess constipation and dyspareunia. De novo dyspareunia and cure rates for constipation and dyspareunia were not statistically different between the two groups. Site-specific fascial rectocele repairs with xenograft or allograft augmentation were found to have similar complication rates as well as objective and subjective cure rates.","1172":"Studies reporting on the recurrence rate after laparoscopic repair of large hiatal hernias (HH), including anatomical asymptomatic recurrence, are scarce. This prospective cohort study evaluated the symptomatic and objective outcome of robot-assisted laparoscopic HH repair up to more than 1 year after surgery. A prospective cohort study was performed on 40 consecutive patients with emphasis on operating times, blood loss, intra- and postoperative complications, symptomatic outcome, and anatomical recurrence rate at a minimum of 1 year after surgery. Robot-assisted laparoscopic HH repair proved to be an effective technique with a relatively low mid-term recurrence rate in this prospective series. The operating team experienced the support of the robotic system as beneficial, especially in the dissection of the hernia sac and extensive crural repair.","1173":"Fecal incontinence remains a major problem with significant social and medical implications. Its causes are diverse and not always apparent. Therefore, diagnostic workup is essential to find the underlying cause and initiate adequate treatment. Treatment options include conservative interventions and surgical procedures. To improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients suffering from fecal incontinence, an update and overview of available techniques can be helpful. This chapter includes indications and complications in conservative and surgical treatment. It also includes flowcharts for everyday practice.","1174":"In 1996, we reported the technical aspects of our new method for end-to-side pancreatojejunostomy (Kakita's method) that we performed in combination with the Whipple procedure without any complications related to failure in the anastomosis. In this chapter, we will introduce our technique in end-to-end style pancreatojejunal anastomosis with fewer anastomotic complications. The purpose of this study was to review Kakita's method with pancreatoduodenectomy. From April 1990 to December 2005, 324 consecutive cases of pancreatoduodenectomy were performed in the Department of Surgery at Kitasato University. In our institute, reconstruction in pancreatoduodenectomy is basically performed according to a modified Child's procedure. Our method is simple and can be applied wherever an end-to-side pancreatojejunal anastomosis is required. It consists of three steps: First, a drainage tube is inserted into the pancreatic duct. The second step, which is the unique aspect of our method, is an attachment of the jejunal wall and the cut surface of the pancreas using a single-layer suture technique. This allows us not only to reduce the number of sutures but also to eliminate some of the complicated manipulations required by other methods. The jejunal wall fully covers the cut surface of the pancreas, leaving no uncovered area between the wall and the pancreas. Third, a direct anastomosis between the pancreatic duct and the mucosal layer of the jejunal loop is applied. In our series, pancreatojejunal anastomotic leakage occurred only in 4 out of 324 patients, which was 1.23%. All patients were successfully treated with conservative therapy using drainage for an extended period postoperatively. The newly devised pancreatojejunostomy in our department is a simple, safe, and reliable procedure with excellent results.","1175":"Anorectal abscesses and fistulas are common maladies that are usually readily diagnosed and effectively treated. However, complex fistulous disease challenges even the most expert of surgical specialists. The management options in this subset of patients are suboptimal, with treatment often requiring multiple procedures, putting the patient at risk for continued symptoms and fecal incontinence. In this chapter, the clinical aspects of perianal suppurative disease are discussed and an attempt is made to deal with many of the more challenging aspects of patient management.","1176":"Despite refinements in the field of gastrointestinal surgical stapling, anastomotic leakage and bleeding still remain a serious problem associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. To prevent or reduce these complications, a diversity of staple line reinforcement techniques have been developed. The available literature from 1977 through 2007 was reviewed to find relevant data about innovative colorectal staple line reinforcement techniques. Many different forms of staple line reinforcement are available. Reinforcement methods can be material applied exogenously to the staple line or incorporated into the staple line. Reinforcement materials can be nonabsorbable, semi-absorbable, or fully absorbable. Gastrointestinal staple line reinforcement is well known, but it is a relatively new method for colorectal surgery. Staple line reinforcement is an effective technique in reducing complications in stapled anastomoses only if proper buttressing material is used. Absorbable material seems to have several advantages over non- or semi-absorbable staple line reinforcement. New and promising techniques are fibrin glue, C-seal, and biosynthesized absorbable cellulose used as staple line reinforcement material. Unfortunately, there is not much experience reported with these new materials, thus further investigation is needed.","1177":"Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is a recent diagnostic tool for detection of small bowel disease. The tiny imaging capsule has to be swallowed by the patient, which allows transmission by radiofrequency two images each second, to sensors worn around the patient's abdomen. After eight hours, the pictures can be downloaded and read by a Gastroenterologist. CE allows for exploration of the entire small bowel mucosa, which involves segments not accessible by classical endoscopy. Moreover, it is the only technique that involves a visualization of the entire small bowel without sedation. Tumors of the small intestine are rather infrequent and could account for approximately 2% of gastrointestinal neoplasms. As symptoms of small bowel tumors are not specific, most published series include patients with bleeding or anemia of undetermined origin, the main indication for performing CE. Currently, no doubt exists of the ability regarding the CE to increase the diagnostic yield of small bowel tumors, or to alter their management and improve their outcome in the absence of metastases. Overall, tumors along the small intestine are located by CE in 2.5%-8.9% of patients who undergo this procedure. While being an evident improvement, CE has some limitations, such as the inability to treat lesions locally or take tissue specimens. This last point is an important shortcoming, because small bowel tumors can be malignant (approximately 2\/3 of the cases) or benign. The future of CE is bright, and special capsule devices already exist to specifically explore the esophagus as well as the large intestine.","1178":"Laparoscopic surgery is increasingly applied to the treatment of gastrointestinal disease. However, the insertion of secondary trocars following pneumoperitoneum carries the risk of serious complications such as major vascular and bowel injuries. Such injury can arise when the force required for the trocar insertion is such that it causes the operator to have impaired control over the entry. There is a need for a procedure of secondary trocar insertion that is safe and easy to perform for training clinicians in laparoscopic surgery. We have developed the \"cut-and-screw\" insertion method for secondary trocar insertion using a specially developed laparoscopic cannula with a sharp edge and housing. Our procedure is simple, rapid, and safe. In this chapter, we describe the technique and present our initial clinical results.","1179":"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a common co-morbidity affecting patients with diabetes. A variety of factors, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, altered gait, and increased pressure on certain regions of the foot, can over time result in a diabetic foot wound. Reducing pressure at the site of the ulcer can promote healing and prevent further ulceration. Offloading is an evidence-based treatment modality for patients with DFUs and is part of the standard protocol for treatment. We discuss here the most common offloading modalities, placing them in the context of relevant medical and compliance issues that affect their use and success.","1180":"Keratinocytes are the major cellular component of epidermis, and they have several critical roles in the wound healing process. They are involved in the intricate mechanisms of initiation, maintenance, and completion of wound healing. The properties of keratinocytes vary depending upon their location and circumstances within chronic wounds. Keratinocytes at the non-healing edges of chronic wounds differ from normal, healthy keratinocytes. The cross-talk between healthy keratinocytes and other cell types participating in wound healing is critical for successful wound closure. This discovery provides the biological foundation for debridement: Removing \"bad\" cells from a quiescent wound edge and exposing or even replacing them with \"healthy\" cells with a high regenerative potential can enhance epithelialization and healing of chronic wounds. This paper will review the biological and pathological properties of keratinocytes as they relate to wound healing, and the ways in which they may provide highly efficacious therapy for patients with chronic wounds.","1181":"Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is implicated in cases of between 220,000 to 240,000 amputations in the United States and Europe annually. Over the last five years, great technical strides have been made in both the surgical and nonsurgical endovascular treatments of CLI. This chapter analyzes and highlights those creative limb salvage strategies now used to treat CLI and save limbs.","1182":"The steps to achieving a healthy healing wound include a correct diagnosis, ensuring a good local blood supply, debriding the wound to reveal a clean base, correcting the biomechanical abnormality, and nurturing the wound until it shows signs of healing. Debridement should be performed as often as necessary until the wound is deemed clean and ready for reconstruction. The repair is then dictated by how much of the foot remains post-debridement and how the foot can be closed in the most biomechanically stable construct possible. The subsequent reconstruction can then usually be accomplished by simple techniques most of the time, and with complex flap reconstruction in about 10% of cases. Wound healing adjuncts such as growth factor, cultured skin, and hyperbaric oxygen can be helpful adjuncts.","1183":"Chronic wounds with exposed bone present a challenge for clinicians. Without intact periosteum, cortical bone is relatively avascular and provides a poor base for wound healing and skin grafting. It has been shown that cortical bone fenestration and decortication can expedite wound healing in exposed calvarial bone. We present a case study where cortical bone fenestration and the subsequent application of human skin equivalent were used to heal a chronic wound of the lower extremity. We propose that this technique can facilitate the production of granulation tissue, and can aid the healing of chronic wounds of the lower extremities associated with exposed bone.","1184":"Chronic venous ulceration is a common and important medical problem that causes significant morbidity. Venous ulcers are expensive to treat, have substantial economic effects in terms of days of work lost, and adversely impact the patient's quality of life. Relying on evidence allows for a rationale of clinical decision making. The objectives of venous ulcer management include the healing of the ulcer, prevention of recurrence, and improvement of edema. Compression is the cornerstone of venous ulcer therapy. Adjunctive modalities such as surgery, growth factors, grafting, biologic skin substitutes, dressings, and oral medication have differing levels of evidence supporting their use, and may also facilitate the healing process.","1185":"Traditional treatment of venous stasis ulceration has focused on compression therapy, debridement, and topical wound management. Prospective randomized studies have shown that only two additional treatment modalities are effective in healing venous ulceration: pentoxyphylline and bilayered living-cell therapy. Although initial healing rates of up to 75% can be accomplished, there is an unacceptably high recurrence rate that is thought to be due to patient noncompliance. However, recurrence of venous stasis ulceration is more likely secondary to uncorrected venous hypertension, a disease whose causes have been largely ignored in wound treatment. Few previous studies show improved healing rates of ulcers after surgical correction of venous hypertension with saphenous stripping. Venous pathology responsible for venous hypertension can now be easily corrected with new minimally invasive techniques. The purpose of this chapter is to define venous hypertension in patients with ulceration, and provide evidence that surgical treatment to eliminate venous hypertension combined with evidence-based treatment strategies will not only improve short-term outcomes but will also prevent recurrent ulceration.","1186":"All chronic wounds are colonized by bacteria. Increased bacterial burden or critical colonization can be deleterious to wound healing. In view of the ubiquitous presence of microbes, the clinician must discern whether bacterial balance (contamination or colonization) or bacterial damage has occurred. Silver is a common topical agent used to combat bacterial burden in chronic wounds. Given the wide array of silver-related wound care products, it is difficult to determine which product should be used. By reviewing relevant scientific evidence, we propose an acronym SILVER to address the key contentious issues. These issues are summarized as SILVER: Signs of bacterial damage, the need for Ionic silver, Log reduction of bacteria, Vehicle (importance of moisture balance), Effect on normal cells, and Bacterial Resistance.","1187":"Surgical, post-surgical deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or thromboembolism is common and potentially catastrophic. Surgical DVT may lead to either immediate post-surgical morbidity or long-term morbidity by way of post-phlebitic syndrome and chronic venous insufficiency. In addition, surgery-associated pulmonary embolism (PE) may lead to significant morbidity or post-surgical mortality. As this surgical complication is so common, both the North American Consensus Conference Committee, sponsored by the American College of Chest Physicians, and the International Consensus Conference Committee, sponsored by the International Society of Angiology, have convened periodically during the past two decades to analyze the highest-quality published studies and publish clear standards and guidelines for prevention and treatment of surgical DVT and thromboembolism. The latest North American Recommendations were published in 2004 and the latest International Committee recommendations were released in 2006. These recommendations are summarized in this chapter, which offers the clinician the latest guidelines for prevention and treatment of surgery-associated DVT and thromboembolism.","1188":"The principal cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality following hepatic resection is excessive intraoperative hemorrhage. This study evaluates the operative use of the LigaSure device in sealing ductal structures during major and minor hepatic resections. Patients were analyzed between June 1994 and December 2005, comparing 89 randomly selected cases undergoing hepatic resections using the clamp-crushing technique with LigaSure electrocautery and hepatic inflow occlusion where appropriate with 70 patients undergoing various hepatic resections using the clamp-crushing technique alone with hepatic inflow occlusion where appropriate. Intraoperative blood loss and perioperative blood transfusion requirements were significantly less for patients in the LigaSure group. LigaSure-assisted hepatic resection was generally performed more quickly than the conventional clamp-crushing technique. The overall maximum postoperative AST, ALT, and bilirubin serum levels were similar in the two groups, as was the incidence of major postoperative complications. The LigaSure device in this randomized study is safe and simple to use, resulting in less perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirement during hepatic parenchymal transection.","1189":"To prevent unnecessary mistakes and avoidable complications in laparoscopic surgery, there has to be proper training. A safe way to train surgeons for laparoscopy is simulation. This study addresses the face validity of ProMIS, an Augmented Reality laparoscopic simulator, as a tool for training suturing skills in laparoscopic surgery. A two-paged, 12-item structured questionnaire, using a five-point-Likert scale, was presented to 50 surgeons\/surgical interns. The participants were allotted to two groups: an \"expert\" (&gt;50 procedures; N=23) and a referent group (&lt;50 procedures; N=27). Non-parametric statistics were used to determine statistical differences. General consensus existed in both expert and referent groups, delineating ProMIS as a useful tool in teaching suturing skills surgeons\/surgical interns (mean + or - st dev, resp, score 4.91 + or - 0.42 and 4.93 + or - 0.38) with regard to realism, tactile feedback, and suturing techniques. Significant differences in opinion regarding the ergonomics and design of ProMIS between the expert and referent groups existed. The ProMIS Augmented Reality laparoscopic simulator is regarded as a useful tool in laparoscopic training in both expert and referent groups. Although significant differences in opinion existed with regards to ergonomics and design of ProMIS, they were present between experts and novices.","1190":"Conventional, pointer-based navigated Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) has been shown to have certain limitations: necessity of instrument change for navigation, changes in the surgeon's line-of-sight axis, and limited length of use of the navigation information. These limitations result in negative consequences regarding the surgeon's attentiveness in any given situation, as well as in his cognitive work-load. The principle of Navigated Control offers advantages concerning these problems and limitations of the conventionally navigated FESS. This Chapter analyzes the first clinical deployment of a navigation-controlled shaver in FESS on the basis of the following questions: (1) Is clinical deployment of the navigation-controlled shaver possible with the pre-clinic evaluated set-up? (2) What information relevant to the surgery is relayed in an intraoperative setting by the navigation-controlled shaver? (3) How does deployment of the navigation-controlled shaver affect the ergonomics of the surgery? Ten patients with chronic sinusitis ethmoidalis were included in the study (average age: 48 [22-71], m:w=4:6). The preoperative and intraoperative workflow was documented according to the Innovation Center Computer Assisted Surgery (ICCAS) Workflow protocol. Data regarding the surgical validity of the information and ergonomic characteristics were recorded by means of questionnaires. The average time required for segmentation of the workspace was 14.2 minutes. The shaver switched off through Navigated Control an average 16.5 times during an FESS. From this amount, five shutdowns on average were initiative and six were determined to be provoked. The shutdowns were indicated by the operators to be correct in 199 of 220 (90.5%) events and in agreement with the actual position and planned resection borders. The quality of the relayed navigation information was indicated with an average Level of Quality (LOQ) of 56.4 [50-80]. The most favorable evaluation was attained for navigation in the area of the sphenoid sinus with 71 points on average [60-80]. During an FESS, the navigation information led to a change in the planned surgical strategy an average of 0.9 [0-3] times. Throughout all surgical procedures, the situation awareness was assessed an average of 2.7 points better than with the conventionally navigated FESS. This also was the case for the cognitive workload (Workload shift) with 2.8 [1-3.5] points. This Chapter proves the clinical applicability of a navigation-controlled instrument by means of a shaver in Ears, Nose, and Throat (ENT) surgery for the first time. Reproduction of the dental splint registration, manual segmentation of the working space, and attachment of the registration star still prove to be critical aspects. Data regarding quality of the information relayed by the navigation system and resulting change in surgical strategy lead to the conclusion that the authors are dealing with, in the overall evaluation, supplementary and surgically relevant information. This information is more efficiently transferred to the surgeon by means of Navigated Control that allows, according to the following results, both an improved understanding of the information and cognitive easing of stress for the surgeon.","1191":"Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a revolutionary technology that provides real-time assessment of surgical goals for the neurosurgeon. This technology has rapidly evolved over the past 15 years and currently is used for a wide variety of pathologies. These include gliomas, pituitary adenomas, epileptogenic foci, and complex hydrocephalus. Early generations of similar systems were bulky, tedious, and had marginal image quality. The next generation of systems provided improved image quality, easier surgical access, the ability to incorporate advanced imaging modalities, and integrated neuronavigation. This chapter reviews the intraoperative MRI technology, the various systems currently available, and the application of this technology to pediatric brain tumors. Continued refinements in the design of these systems will likely make them standard of care in the near future.","1192":"Recent advances in neurosurgery and interventional neuroradiology have brought us a new aspect in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. The present series provides a balanced overview of the treatment of aneurysms in surgical clipping and coil embolization. Between January 2004 and March 2006, a total of 119 consecutive patients with cerebral aneurysms underwent endovascular embolization or surgical clipping. Of these, 79 patients suffered an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), whereas the remaining 40 patients had nonruptured cerebral aneurysms. Of the 32 surgically treated patients, 25 (78.1%) achieved a favorable outcome. Of the 47 patients who underwent endovascular embolization, 38 (80.9%) achieved a favorable outcome. No significant difference was observed regarding the proportion of favorable outcomes between the two treatment modalities. Four patients (5.5%) who underwent endovascular embolization required re-treatments but no re-treatments were needed in the surgically treated patients. Of the 40 cases with nonruptured aneurysms, 12 (30%) were treated using surgical clipping, whereas 28 (70%) underwent endovascular embolization. The complication rates of the two treatment modalities demonstrated no significant difference. A combined microsurgical-endovascular team approach is thus considered to provide the most effective means to achieve favorable outcomes for patients with cerebral aneurysms. A case-by-case evaluation based on the individual characteristics of each aneurysm is therefore considered to be essential.","1193":"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a promising new tool in the treatment of a variety of spinal disorders. MIS laminectomy techniques provide an effective means of achieving lumbar decompression. MIS corpectomy techniques have not been described. If feasible, such a technique would be optimal in the treatment of spinal metastatic disease, where traditional open techniques can result in a significant burden to a compromised patient. In this study, we explored the feasibility of a dual-tube minimally invasive thoracic corpectomy approach in a cadaver model. A minimally invasive thoracolumbar costotransversectomy and corpectomy were perfumed in eight adult cadavers. A dual-tube technique was used to perform a costotransversectomy followed by a corpectomy on one side, and through the opposite tube a transpedicular approach on the contralateral side. Pre- and postoperative CT scans of all cadavers were obtained to measure the cross-sectional area of the vertebral bodies in each specimen via a CT workstation. Reconstruction of the anterior column was attempted in some cadavers using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement. A successful costotransversectomy and corpectomy were completed in each cadaver. A percutaneous delivery system was successful in allowing an anterior column reconstruction using PMMA as a strut graft in selected cadavers. We demonstrated that a dual-tube MIS approach to thoracic corpectomy is technically feasible. Additionally, spinal stabilization can be achieved via percutaneous PMMA administration. This approach may provide a minimally invasive option in the treatment of select spinal metastases.","1194":"Osteotomy of the proximal metatarsal in combination with a distal soft tissue procedure for the correction of moderate to severe hallux valgus deformity is commonly performed. All described techniques have complications such as non-union and malunion, and many are extremely technically demanding. The purpose of this study is to review the results of a novel technique for the correction of hallux valgus, an opening-wedge osteotomy of the proximal first metatarsal with plate fixation. A review was performed of the results of 23 patients who underwent correction of hallux valgus with proximal metatarsal opening-wedge osteotomy, in combination with a distal soft tissue procedure and exostectomy, if indicated. All osteotomies were secured with plate fixation on the medial side. Indications for surgery included a painful bunion for greater than one year and the failure of nonoperative treatment. Mean corrections of 15 degrees and 7 degrees were achieved for the hallux valgus and 1-2 intermetatarsal angles, respectively. Four complications occurred, including one wound dehiscence, two incidences of drifting of the hallux valgus angle, and one delayed union. We find the opening-wedge osteotomy of the proximal first metatarsal to be a technically straightforward procedure for correcting moderate to severe hallux valgus. The correction obtained is comparable to other described techniques with a complication rate equal to or lower than most published data at this time.","1195":"Increased femoral component lateralization has been reported to recreate femoral offset accurately, and should provide better function. Concerns exist that negative effects may occur such as increased thigh pain, trochanteric bursitis, and loosening. The current study aims to examine whether a lateralized femoral component design is associated with increase in thigh pain, trochanteric pain, or implant failure when used to recreate hip soft tissue balance and stability. The authors reviewed 98 total hip arthroplasties (THA) using the Mallory-Head Porous femoral component. Group 1 had 49 consecutive THA performed before the lateralized stem was available. Group 2 had 49 consecutive THA in which lateralization was deemed necessary, based upon preoperative templating and intraoperative soft tissue balancing. Follow up averaged 46 and 38 months, respectively. No stems failed. Group 1 had three dislocations and Group 2 had none with increased offset. Six (12%) patients in Groups 1 and 3 (6%) patients in Group 2 had trochanteric pain (p&lt;0.05). Three (6%) patients had moderate thigh pain in Group 1 and none in Group 2. Significantly less trochanteric and thigh pain was observed in those patients in whom a lateralized stem was deemed necessary. The use of a lateralized stem improves the accuracy of hip soft tissue reconstruction and does not increase thigh pain, trochanteric pain, or loosening. Accurate soft tissue reconstruction may decrease trochanteric and thigh pain and improve function following THA.","1196":"Whereas femoral component modularity allows the surgeon to address a variety of femoral defects in complex total hip arthroplasty (THA), breakage of modular stems is a known complication that typically occurs at the taper junction. In response, a proprietary process of taper roller-hardening that increases taper strength by a factor of 3.5 was introduced in 1999. The authors reviewed a consecutive series of patients by a single surgeon who underwent cementless revision or difficult primary THA with a taper roller-hardened modular calcar replacement prosthesis, and have the potential for a minimum of two-year follow up. In 116 patients, 123 hips were involved. Two surgeries were primary, 101 were revision\/conversion, 18 were for reimplantation after treatment of infection, and two were intramedullary total femur constructs, one of which was a reimplantation after sepsis. The patients' ages at surgery averaged 71 years, and BMIs averaged 28.12 kg\/m2. Nine of the patients, all with single hip involvement, were lost to contact. Twenty-one patients, three of whom had bilateral hip involvement, expired during the follow-up period with implant outcome known. Follow up in the patients who survived averaged 44 (range: 18-78) months. Six femoral components have been revised: two (1.6%) due to recurrent sepsis, three (2.4%) due to sepsis, one (0.8%) from periprosthetic fracture, and none from septic loosening or component breakage. Survivorship with aseptic loosening as the end-point was 100%. In this series, roller-hardening appears to improve the durability of the tapered junction. No roller-hardened modular calcar devices have failed due to component breakage. However, their use is not recommended in the totally deficient proximal femur, as fatigue breaks of distally fixed monoblock extensively coated stems have been reported. Caution is advised when potting or anchoring any stem in the femoral diaphysis without reconstituting proximal bone stock and support.","1197":"Patients considering total knee arthroplasty (TKA) now have higher expectations of performance including long-term implant survival and a rapid return of normal function. While modern implant systems have many sizes available, implant fit - especially in women - is often imperfect. The ability to achieve outstanding outcomes has many factors, requiring excellent implant fit, alignment, stability, range of motion, and kinematics, as well as long-lasting bearing surfaces and durable fixation. We present the initial two years of experience of 668 consecutive cemented total knee arthroplasties using an implant and bearing surface specifically designed to address these issues. The Triathlon TKA uses anthropomorphic sizing, taking into account the gender-specific variable aspect ratio for a better fit. Modified posterior femoral condylar geometry coupled with a rotary arc polyethylene design allows for flexion greater than 150 degrees while rotating 20 degrees internally and externally both in flexion and extension. The X3 polyethylene insert has demonstrated superior wear characteristics. Early outcomes revealed mean Knee Society pain and function scores, improving from a preoperative total score of 78 to a postoperative score of 182. Patients exhibited a rapid return of knee motion from a mean preoperative flexion of 102 degrees to 116 degrees at 6 weeks, 124 degrees at 3 months, and 128 degrees at 1 year. Whereas long-term results cannot be predicted, no early failures or serious complications were encountered. A prospective long-term outcome study of this cohort is underway.","1198":"The Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) was recently approved for implantation in America. Recovery was evaluated and the efficacy of a musculoskeletal hospital was addressed for an initial group of patients who underwent medial compartment UKA with the Oxford device. Between October 2004 and December 2005, 142 medial UKAs were performed in 125 patients and included 11 simultaneous and six staged bilateral UKA procedures, and one simultaneous UKA\/TKA procedure. The patients' ages averaged 62 (range: 41-87) years, weight 90 kg, and body mass index (BMI) 31.6 kg\/m(2). Sixty-one UKAs were performed in obese patients (BMI &gt;32). The length of stay averaged 1.3 days. In 121 (97%) cases, patients were discharged directly to home. In 23 (18%) cases, home health physical therapy was used. Outpatient physical therapy was used in 95 (76%) cases. Only four (3%) patients required a skilled nursing or post-discharge rehabilitation stay. Five reoperations were required: one revision to TKA for tibial plateau fracture, one revision to TKA for tibial loosening, one radical debridement and staged reimplantation of primary TKA for sepsis, and two arthroscopic procedures (one retained cement, and one synovitis). The average arc of motion at initial six-week follow up was 116 degrees , with 56% of knees having greater than 120 degrees and 82% more than 110 degrees . Absent, or only mild, pain was reported in 85% of knees. Seventy-five percent of patients had good or excellent Knee Society scores by six weeks postoperatively. UKA provides excellent early function and pain relief with rapid recovery when performed at a specialty musculoskeletal hospital. Early discharge appears to be safe and does not transfer the burden of care to other facilities or home health rehabilitation services.","1199":"Long-term control of malignant pleural effusion is an important goal of therapy in patients with pleural dissemination. The authors have carried out limited operations combined with parietal pleurectomy (PL) for non-small cell lung cancer patients with pleural dissemination, based on the hypothesis that the most effective target area for controlling malignant pleural effusion is the parietal pleura. In our 25 years of experience, 54 patients with pleural dissemination (26 also had malignant pleural effusion) have undergone this surgical treatment. The operative procedures used for resection of lung parenchyma were partial resection in 25 patients, lobectomy in 24, bilobectomy in two, segmentectomy in two, and no parenchymal resection (PL only) in one. Postoperative intrapleural chemotherapy and systemic chemotherapy (2-4 cycles) also were applied in 43 patients. The pathological stages were IIIB in 44 patients and IV in ten. The overall three-, five-, and ten-year survival rates were 29.0%, 15.0%, and 7.5%, respectively. Twenty patients survived for more than two years. Recurrent malignant pleural effusion developed in only two of 30 patients whose recurrent patterns could be clearly identified. Although this was not a clinical randomized comparative study, multimodality treatment that included the use of PL appears to be a useful option for treatment of this disease in appropriately selected patients.","1200":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has proven to be one of the major causes for increasing morbidity among general medical and surgical patients. VTE may have a major role after cardiac surgery by increasing morbidity related to hospital stay, economic burden, discharge planning, complications associated with anticoagulation therapy, and mortality when it ends as a fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). However, patients who undergo cardiac procedures or surgeries pose unique challenges in prevention and treatment of VTE. Clinical diagnosis is always difficult in these patients due to non-specific symptoms or because the patient is asymptomatic. Among the cardiology and cardiac surgery population, thrombosis risk appears to be inherent as a result of multiple co-morbidities as well as direct trauma to the vasculature. Prevention of VTE by prophylactic measures remains the most economical and effective method in current clinical practice. However, many modalities used for VTE prophylaxis have been restricted to the general surgical orthopedic population and can be difficult to apply, especially in patients following cardiac surgery.","1201":"Varicose veins are a widespread problem, and are encountered by various medical specialists. Symptoms can appear from mild, such as tiredness of the legs, to severe chronic ulcers. Varicose veins are generally caused by the reflux of an incompetent saphenofemoral junction and long saphenous vein. In the presence of reflux, the treatment should be directed at the ablation of the hydrostatic forces of the reflux. Conventional surgical treatment consists of a high ligation of the saphenofemoral junction and stripping of the saphenous vein. In the era of minimally invasive surgery, various endovenous techniques have been developed, including endovenous laser therapy. This technique is relatively cheap and can be performed under only local anesthesia. During endovenous laser therapy, energy is delivered to the vein wall, causing it to shrink and eventually occlude. Currently, the mechanisms of action involved in laser treatment are not fully understood. Clinical studies have shown occlusion rates to be very competitive to conventional high ligation and stripping and superior cosmetics. Complications may include mild to moderate pain, ecchymosis, induration, hematoma, and phlebitis. All of these are generally self-limiting. In the challenge of finding the correct balance between a low incidence of varicose vein recurrence and complications and optimal cosmetic results, endovenous laser therapy is a promising modality. However, controlled studies that assess the effectiveness of endovenous laser therapy in comparison to saphenofemoral ligation with saphenous vein stripping are crucial before considering endovenous laser therapy as the new standard treatment.","1202":"We have introduced a number of modifications to minimize the deleterious effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) by reducing the surface of the extracorporeal circulation (ECC), the length of the ECC circuit, the contact surface of the oxygenator, and the volume of priming solution, in addition to employing biocompatible systems and isolation of excess blood volumes of venous reservoirs in transfusion bags very early in CPB. Encouraged by the results of our initial \"Compact ECC,\" we have decided to improve it by implementing other techniques such as controlled hemodilution of the patient by reducing the diameter of ECC venous tubing (from 1\/2 in. to 3\/8 in.), limiting contact surface of the oxygenator and venous reservoir, positioning the oxygenator and venous reservoir at the level of the patient's shoulder, and employing venous cannulae adapted to vacuum assisted venous drainage (VAVD) to replace venous drainage by gravity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate postoperative outcomes of Compact ECC. Three groups of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) are compared. Our new Compact ECC shows improved outcomes through reduced postoperative ventilation time, blood loss, intensive care stay, need for blood transfusion, and levels of lactate dehydrogenase despite the patients' pathologies and surgeries being more complex.","1203":"A simplified technique of cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) is presented for the treatment of high-risk bladder cancer patients. From 1968 to 2003, 2118 cystectomies with CU were performed for bladder cancer patients with uremic manifestations. The mean age was 67.4 +\/- 27.3; 1206 patients were men and 912 were women. Cutaneous uretero-ureterostomy (CUU) was performed by three methods: (a) one ureter was brought across the midline and anastomosed end-to-side to the other ureter (end-to-side uretero-ureterostomy, ESUU); (b) the two ureters were placed side by side in a double-barrel fashion (double-barrel ureterostomy, DBU); or (c) the two distal ureteric ends were anastomosed together before fixation to the skin (side-to-side uretero-ureterostomy, SSUU). Selection of the technique depended on ureteric length and girth. No complications specific to CUU have occurred. Serum creatinine was normalized and intravenous pyelogram (IVP) showed improvement of obstructive manifestations and renal function. Ureterostomy stenosis was more common in ESUU than in DBU and SSUU; it responded to dilatation. This simple and easy procedure is shown to have a low rate of operative and postoperative complications and is indicated for high-risk patients with bladder cancer.","1204":"Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common problem. Hysterectomy has been the standard treatment for women with heavy menstrual bleeding who have not responded to medical treatment. Minimally invasive procedures to destroy the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) are alternatives to hysterectomy. They involve destroying the endometrium using lasers, radiofrequency waves, electrocautery, microwaves, heated saline, or a heated balloon. Microwave endometrial ablation (MEA) is one of these minimally invasive procedures. In this Chapter, use of microwave MEA in the management of heavy menstrual bleeding is described. MEA was developed in Bath, UK in the mid 1990s. MEA is a second-generation method of EA, which involves the use of microwaves at a fixed frequency of 9.2 GHz to destroy the endometrial lining. Initial results for MEA were encouraging, with active treatment times of less than three minutes and high satisfaction rates. Recent studies also showed an equivalent outcome with regards to patients' satisfaction and health-related quality-of-life issues. The procedure, indications, contraindications, principles of operation, potential risks, results, and patient-satisfaction is described herein.","1205":"The most common site of extragenital endometriosis is the intestinal tract, which accounts for approximately 80% of all extragenital endometriosis. The symptoms of intestinal endometriosis are crampy pain, flatulence, painful tenesmus, hyper-peristalsis, progressive constipation, diarrhea alternating with constipation, and occasionally rectal bleeding. As endometriosis in this location often undergoes fibrotic changes, it can be resistant to hormonal therapy, which makes surgical therapy the only option for many women. Until recently, laparoscopic treatment of bowel endometriosis was thought to be impossible. Development of several safe and effective techniques for laparoscopic treatment of intestinal endometriosis has made such treatment possible. In this chapter, the authors describe five proven techniques for treatment of intestinal endometriosis: shaving, disk excision, anterior rectal wall excision, segmental resection, and appendectomy.","1206":"Although at present nonabsorbable meshes are the preferred material for tension-free hernioplasty, some problems with their use are still to be addressed (i.e., chronic pain and infections). To address these disadvantages, a collagen-based material, the porcine small intestinal submucosa mesh, has recently been developed for hernia repair. The technique to use this material in performing an hernioplasty is described. A preshaped Surgisis Inguinal Hernia Matrix (IHM) is fashioned as appropriate, with a slit 2 cm from its inferior edge to accommodate the spermatic cord, placed for at least 10 min into a dish with room-temperature normosaline to be rehydrated and then transferred to the already prepared and dissected inguinal region. After drawing its tails around the cord, the mesh is sutured to the inguinal ligament with a continuous suture of PDS II 2\/0, starting from the pubic tubercle laterally up to the deep orifice. The fixation of the mesh to the internal oblique abdominal muscle and the rectus sheath is accomplished with interrupted stitches. An extra stitch is placed between the two tails to close the new deep orifice. We conclude that an hernioplasty using Surgisis IHM is feasible with promising results.","1207":"The search for safe and effective means of herniorrhaphies has been ongoing for more than a century. Evidence strongly supports tension-free hernia repairs in most patients, which result in a 50% reduction in a ten-year cumulative rate of hernia recurrence compared with tissue repairs. Polypropylene mesh revolutionized the field approximately 50 years ago; however, limitations of traditional polypropylene mesh have fueled the research and development of other prosthetic and biologic mesh products. Newer polyester and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) products are designed to improve pliability and reduce adhesiogenic potential. Combination meshes capitalize on the ideal properties of biomaterials by strategically positioning particular mesh surfaces to selectively impede or promote tissue ingrowth. The most recent improvement in mesh products is the introduction of \"lightweight\" meshes. In response to mounting evidence that the traditional formulations of polypropylene meshes are over-engineered, lightweight meshes were designed with less polypropylene per surface area. Future research may prove that most meshes used currently are \"mechanical overkill,\" which may lead to a widespread use of lightweight meshes to provide a durable repair, minimize chronic mesh-related discomfort, and improve the overall quality of life of hernia patients.","1208":"There is a renewed interest in the surgical repair of ventral hernias due to new meshes and new techniques to use these meshes. The standard of care for ventral hernia repair, the Rives-Stoppa repair, is now more commonly done in the USA. Originally, only polypropylene mesh (PPM) or polyester meshes were available for this technique and they had to be placed extraperitoneally. With development of the laparoscopic approach for ventral hernia repair using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), newer coated meshes for intraperitoneal placement were developed. Companies have also combined polypropylene mesh (PPM) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) into a unique mesh and numerous biologic meshes are being introduced. All of these meshes have led to several new methods for ventral hernia repair (including parastomal hernia) and in those cases where mesh is not indicated, one non-mesh repair, the components separation, has received renewed attention.","1209":null,"1210":"Surgery is the main modality in the therapy of retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas (RSTS). A retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the results of aggressive surgical treatment in a series of patients of primary and recurrent retroperitoneal sarcomas. A review of 166 consecutive patients with RSTS operated on at the Institute of Oncology in Ljubljana from 1975 through 2005 were reviewed. A total of 269 operations were performed on 166 patients. The five- and ten-year survival rates of patients with localized sarcoma were 52% and 38%, respectively. Factors that influenced the survival were distant metastases, tumor grade, and type of resection. The patients with R0 resections had a five-year survival rate of 75% and a ten-year survival rate of 65%; the respective rates for the patients with R1 resections were 25% and 7% (p &lt; 0.00001). When only R0 resection was considered, referral status (primary, residual, recurrent RSTS) influenced survival (p = 0.004). The quality of initial surgery is a crucial prognostic factor to predicting survival in patients with RSTS. Complete surgical resection without microscopic residuum and contamination is likely to offer the best chances for long-term survival. Unless no other treatment modalities are available, aggressive surgery for recurrent sarcoma is recommended.","1211":"Laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) was introduced into clinical practice by Kurt Semm in 1983. Since then, a number of methods for performing LA have emerged in the literature. However, the majority of these modifications require costly equipment. In this short technical chapter, we describe a very simple and inexpensive method of performing this procedure without resorting to any additional expensive paraphernalia.","1212":"The most prominent and severe complication after a total gastrectomy is severe reflux esophagitis. We have developed a procedure involving jejunal pouch-esophagostomy to avoid such postoperative reflux. The novel procedure reported here initially involves folding a jejunal segment of approximately 35 cm in length. A side-to-side jejuno-jejunostomy at the anti-mesenteric side was then affected using a 100-mm linear stapler. This resulted in a jejunal pouch, 10 cm in length, and a 7-cm apical section of unstapled jejunal loop. Finally, an esophago-jejuno end-to-side anastomosis (pouch-esophagostomy) was formed at the right anterior wall of the apical bridge using a circular stapler. We have therefore introduced a \"partial posterior fundoplication\"-like wrapping technique to the standard gastrectomy using the apical bridge of the jejunal pouch. Only a little postoperative reflux was revealed by barium meal testing - even in the Trendelenburg's position - in patients treated with the described anti-reflux anastomosis procedure. Jejunal pouch reconstruction with partial posterior wrapping is a useful procedural addition for minimizing reflux esophagitis following a total gastrectomy.","1213":"Laparoscopic minimally invasive procedures have become feasible and safe alternatives to open surgery in the management of esophageal and gastric leiomyomas. There are two major indications for the surgical management of these benign tumors: the presence of symptoms and the need for histopathologic confirmation if the biological behavior is unclear. The approach of choice for leiomyomas located in the very distal esophagus or gastroesophageal junction is the laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor. For the resection of gastric leiomyomas, three surgical procedures are primarily performed: the laparoscopic wedge resection without gastrotomy for tumors of the anterior gastric wall, lesser\/greater curvature, and fundus; the laparoscopic wedge resection with gastrotomy for tumors of the posterior gastric wall (\"transgastric approach\"); and the laparoscopic intragastric resection for tumors of the posterior gastric wall (\"intragastric approach\"). This chapter summarizes these minimally invasive techniques and provides an update of the most recent clinical data that is available.","1214":"The use of laparoscopic surgery in managing liver malignancies has been developed only recently because of the complexity of liver surgery. Diagnostic laparoscopy is useful in staging liver malignancies before resection. The need for laparoscopic staging of colorectal liver metastasis has diminished as a result of better imaging technology such as positron emission tomography (PET). Laparoscopy still plays an important role in the staging of hepatocellular carcinoma because of the high incidences of multifocal tumors and venous invasion. Recently, laparoscopic liver resection was possible with the availability of new instruments that allow relatively bloodless liver transection. Small series have reported a conversion rate of 10% to 20%, and the complication rate and transfusion rate appeared to be comparable with open surgery in a few retrospective case-control studies. Limited data also suggest that oncological clearance and long-term outcome were not compromised. However, the role of laparoscopic liver resection is confined mainly to wedge or segmental resection of anterior segments of the right lobe and left lateral segments. Although successful laparoscopic hemihepatectomy and resections of segments VII and VIII have been reported at the time of this writing, these should be attempted only in centers that have already acquired wide experience with laparoscopic liver resection. Another application of laparoscopic surgery for the management of liver malignancies is laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation, which is gaining popularity because of its well-documented safety and efficacy. With further developments in technology, that laparoscopic surgery will have a greater impact on the management of liver malignancies is foreseeable in the near future.","1215":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of tumor detection in parenchymal organs and their resection by use of a micromagnetic needle detection system (MNDS). A micromagnetic needle (maximum magnetic flux density = 120 mT) and a micromagnetic needle-setting device were used. An in vitro laboratory study with a gumball within gelatin representing a tumor was conducted to calculate detection rates and to measure the time required for resection by MNDS. An animal study with the cervical lymph nodes of pigs representing tumors was conducted to measure the time required for lymph node resection. The removal rate of the target lymph node was 100% with MNDS. Results show that MNDS may be useful for tumor resection in the presence of air and for the resection of tumors that are difficult to detect by ultrasonography.","1216":"Endoluminal resection in the gastrointestinal tract is limited to resection of the lamina mucosa and lamina submucosa. The integrity of the gastric wall, represented by the lamina muscularis propria, must be maintained, because no safe endoscopic methods of ensuring adequate closure of the gastric wall are currently available. With the flexible stapling system SurgAssist (Power Medical Interventions ([Power Medical Interventions Deutschland GmbH, Hamburg, Germany]), for the first time, a stapling device is available that can be introduced transorally into the gastric area together with a gastroscope. After performing appropriate animal experiments, full-thickness inverted resection of a tumorous section of the gastric wall was done in two patients with early gastric adenocarcinoma. In both patients, the authors were able to resect full-thickness sections of the gastric wall with a diameter of approximately 4 x 4 cm. A gastroscope was used for control of the resected areas in the stomach; one patient required endoscopic hemostasis. The further postoperative course was uneventful in both patients. The method presented herein offers, for the first time, an exclusively transoral, surgical procedure for full-thickness resection of the gastric wall. In addition to early gastric adenocarcinoma with incipient infiltration of the submucosa, possible indications for this procedure include gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","1217":"Gastrointestinal resections and anastomoses are commonly performed using stapling devices in a wide range of open and laparoscopic procedures. Whether they are hand-sewn or stapled, anastomoses have an associated leak rate that can impart significant morbidity or mortality to a procedure. In addition, bleeding from staple lines can cause additional complications. Staple line reinforcement is one intervention that has been postulated to reduce both the leak rate and associated bleeding risk. This can be accomplished with either material applied exogenously to the staple line, as in an engineered absorbable biomaterial, or it may use a material - either absorbable or nonabsorbable - that is incorporated into the staple line. A number of reinforcements are currently available but all add time and cost to the procedures in which they are used. However, preventing the complications associated with leak and hemorrhage from staple lines may justify the added cost of these devices. A review of the available published literature was performed to review the current data pertaining to the reinforcement of living tissue and anastomoses with these various reinforcements available to surgeons.","1218":"Dermabond (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) is a cyanoacrylate adhesive normally indicated for skin wound closure. This study describes the emergency use of this adhesive to control bleeding close to coronary anastomoses in exceptional cases. Dermabond was used in 17 patients who underwent cardiac surgery during an eight-month period, where other haemostatic interventions were unsuitable. It was applied for haemorrhage in 15 patients and control air leaks in two of the patients. Haemostasis was successful with Dermabond alone in 11 patients; the remaining four required additional interventions. It effectively controlled haemorrhage from ventricular pacing wires, vascular sling holes, peri-anastomotic bleeding, and epicardial tears. The adhesive was not placed directly on any graft because of embolic risk. In the two patients with visible air leaks, it was successfully used. No patient events were recorded as a result of haemorrhage and no reported toxicity. Dermabond may be indicated in circumstances in which haemostasis with traditional methods has failed or is inappropriate. A need for further high-quality objective research exists on the effectiveness and long-term safety of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate in cardiac surgery.","1219":"Perioperative hypothermia remains a common problem during anesthesia and surgery. Unfortunately, the implementation of new minimally invasive surgical procedures has not lead to a reduction of this problem. Heat losses from the skin can be reduced by thermal insulation to avoid perioperative hypothermia. However, only a small amount of information is available regarding the physical properties of insulating materials used in the Operating Room (OR). Therefore, several materials using validated manikins were tested. Heat loss from the surface of the manikin can be described as:\"Q = h . DeltaT . A\" where Q = heat flux, h = heat exchange coefficient, DeltaT = temperature gradient between the environment and surface, and A = covered area. Heat flux per unit area and surface temperature were measured with calibrated heat flux transducers. Environmental temperature was measured using a thermoanemometer. The temperature gradient between the surface and environment (DeltaT) was varied and \"h\" was determined by linear regression analysis as the slope of \"DeltaT\" versus heat flux per unit area. The reciprocal of the heat exchange coefficient defines the insulation. The insulation values of the materials varied between 0.01 Clo (plastic bag) to 2.79 Clo (2 layers of a hospital duvet). Given the range of insulating materials available for outdoor activities, significant improvement in insulation of patients in the OR is both possible and desirable.","1220":"In cases of morbid obesity, excessive soft tissue in the abdomen forms an apron-like deformity called panniculus because of rapid weight loss due to cancer. In laparotomy with stoma aimed at cancer resection, obesity is reported as a major risk factor of stoma complications, one of the most frequent of which is necrosis. In one patient in whom a laparotomy was performed through a midline incision, the authors also carried out an abdominal dermolipectomy aimed at reducing distortion of the abdominal wall in relation to the stoma. This procedure provided two important advantages for stoma surgery, stability, and better postoperative care by the patient.","1221":"The repair of all tissue disruption begins with hemostasis and tissue sealing. Fibrin sealant is a concentrated mix of the factors required for the body to initiate this process. By applying this mixture directly to the site of injury, clotting and wound healing can be facilitated. Studies have demonstrated that fibrin sealant is effective in controlling bleeding and inducing tissue sealing in many organs. It is particularly useful in hepatobiliary surgery due to the soft nature of liver parenchyma and its propensity to bleed and leak bile. This chapter will discuss the basic science foundation of fibrin sealants and their applications in hepatic surgery.","1222":"Postsurgical intra-abdominal adhesions cause significant morbidity and mortality, with small bowel obstruction being the most common complication. The urge to prevent adhesion formation has resulted in multiple experimental and clinical trials and the development of numerous antiadhesive agents. Through the years, hyaluronan-based antiadhesives have proved to be successful in the reduction of adhesion formation. Despite the obvious effectiveness of hyaluronan, there is still much debate on its clinical use and mechanisms of action. Various hyaluronan-containing products have been introduced and withdrawn from the market. The application of hyaluronan in combination with meshes for hernia repair appears to be a promising concept. Not all different applications of hyaluronan are well known and its use in patients with a malignancy or abdominal infection remains controversial. Here an overview is given on the effects of hyaluronan-based antiadhesive agents in abdominal surgery, its use in infectious conditions, and its oncologic repercussions. The most important mechanism of action appears to be the mechanical separation of damaged peritoneal surfaces. However, the biological effects of hyaluronan, such as modulation of cell proliferation and peritoneal biology, might also be of influence.","1223":"This chapter assesses the safety of freehand placement of an infusion catheter (outer diameter, 0.3 mm) in brainstems of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) for local infusion therapy. A posterior midline approach through the cerebellum and roof of the fourth ventricle was used to implant catheters into a pontine target area. Computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and histology were used to examine the position of the implants. The freehand placement of a catheter resulted in approximately 5-mm variations in anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral locations of the targeted implantation site. No evidence of morbidity from the surgery, or from the infusion process was present. In conclusion, small-diameter catheters for chronic drug infusions can be implanted safely into the brainstem, an eloquent region that has been considered surgically inoperable. Infusion systems may offer a minimally invasive, generally applicable tool to provide chronic therapy for central nervous system (CNS) lesions.","1224":null,"1225":"To describe the surgical planning and treatment approach in addressing the oral and maxillofacial needs for one particular patient suffering congenital anomalies of the craniofacial anatomy. A secondary objective is to restore mandibular and maxillary function and esthetics to the young, adult patient. The tertiary objective is to educate the surgeon as to alloplastic implant options that may be available to restore function and relieve pain for the patient missing certain anatomical structures from birth. Through the use of advanced medical imaging tools, a thorough understanding of the patient's prior failed medical treatments, and a meticulous understanding of the benefits of alloplastic reconstruction, the surgeon can mitigate patient symptoms and at the same time increase the probability of a successful outcome. The surgeon can then collaborate with the surgical and implant design team to not only prescribe the surgical correction necessary, but also design and construct the actual temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and mandibular implants used for the case, as well as perform mock surgery on a stereolithography anatomical (SLA) model needed to restore function and esthetics for the patient. The end result is that a Patient-Specific (custom) (TMJ Implants, Inc., Golden, CO, USA) prosthesis can then be manufactured and adapted surgically to the patient's unique anatomy. The early results from this alloplastic reconstructive surgery have brought forth the anticipated results of replacement of the congenitally absent TMJ, improvement of jaw function, reduction of joint pain, as well as improvement of the esthetics. Without this breakthrough surgical development, many of these congenital anatomically deficient patients would not be able to enjoy normal breathing, mastication, jaw function, esthetics, oral and dental health, and the emotional relief that these corrections allow. Many patients who suffer birth-related anatomical deficiencies (such as cleft lip and branchial arch syndrome) never receive the surgical correction necessary. Many have had autogenous reconstruction of missing mandibular and TMJ structures only to relapse, at times, into a more disfiguring and lasting condition. By simply placing a Christensen Fossa-Eminence Prosthesis (FEP) and Condylar Prosthesis (CP) in a total joint-replacement solution, one is more likely to achieve satisfactory TMJ mobility and reduction in pain, as well as the mechanical replacement of missing anatomical structures and predictable and lasting improvement. As an additional benefit, the patient also would enjoy enhanced esthetics. ","1226":"This article presents the results of a retrospective review of six osteochondral lesions on six patients (five men and one woman) treated with transplantation of cryopreserved talar allograft and ankle joint distraction. All patients complained of ankle pain existing for a long time secondary to a traumatic episode confirmed through MRI. Lesions ranged in measurement from 0.8 cm x 0.8 cm to 3.2 cm x 1.8 cm with an average size of 2.1 cm x 1.5 cm. Each patient underwent talar dome transplantation using fresh frozen talar allograft followed by ankle distraction. Distraction was obtained using a three-ring multiplanar external fixation device. All surgeries were performed between 2002 and 2004. All external fixators were removed at 8 weeks and patients remained partial-weight bearing in a removable cast boot for an additional 8 weeks. Serial postoperative radiographs showed complete consolidation of the allograft within 16 weeks. The average follow up time was 24 months, and all patients related a subjective decrease in symptoms and increase in activity levels. Patients were also evaluated utilizing the Maryland Foot Score both pre- and postoperatively. Preoperatively, four patients were graded as fair and two were graded as poor. Postoperatively, two patients related excellent results, three patients related good results, and one patient related fair results. Several patients experienced minor complications such as pin site irritation (five patients), painful talar wire (one patient), and periostitis (one patient). No patients experienced any major complications and none have required additional surgery. We feel that these initial results warrant further investigation of this treatment.","1227":"Twenty-eight patients who suffered traumatic obsolete incomplete paralysis were treated with intradural lysis and peripheral nerve implantation by a microsurgery technique. The endorachis was opened and the fibrous bands adhering to the spinal cord from the arachnoid, pia mater spinalis, ligamenta denticulatum, and the initial part of the nerve root were completely relieved. The abnormal spinal cord was then opened by three to six incisions, which were each 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm deep and longer than the abnormal portion. A cyst found in the back or side of the spinal cord was opened and the liquid in it was drained. After that, the denuded spineurium and perineurium of the autogenous sural nerve were grafted, which makes the character and aspect of the nerve like the cauda equine. The nerve was longitudinally implanted into the incised spinal cord, and the cyst was waded with grafted nerve and at least one of them is ectropion sutured with the pia mater with 9-0 scatheless wire as a drain. Finally, the endorachis was covered by sacrospinal muscle flap. These patients were followed for 2 years to 8 years (average 3.5 years), and the sensibility and motion of each increased at least one grade. The strength of the main muscle was increased two grades and reached four grades in 11 patients, and the capability to walk was recovered. Relieving of the adhesion in the endorhachis, carving the cicatricial spinal cord, and implanting the autogenous peripheral nerve yields good results by initial clinical observation for traumatic obsolete and incomplete paralysis.","1228":"With increased life expectancy and an aging population, many patients suffering from progressive lumbar spinal stenosis with symptomatic neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) have been limited to a choice between nonsurgical therapies or a more traumatic decompressive surgical procedure, with or without lumbar fusion. The interspinous process decompression (IPD) system, the X-STOP implant, was developed to provide a minimally invasive alternative therapeutic treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. The X-STOP IPD system, surgical indications, operative techniques, and the potential complications and their avoidance are described and discussed herein.","1229":"Spinal tumors that are radioresistant or cause bony compression of the spinal cord often require surgical decompression to protect or restore neurological function. Metastatic lesions and primary tumors such as multiple myeloma usually arise in the vertebral body, which can collapse and become unstable, and can compress the anterior columns of the cord. Laminectomy is often ineffective in these patients, and direct anterior decompression through thoracotomy is the widely-accepted solution to the neurological problem. The anterior surgical approach is particularly challenging in the upper thoracic spine. Patients with limited pulmonary reserve due to pneumonectomy or pulmonary metastasis might not tolerate the loss of lung capacity necessitated by either thoracotomy or thoracoscopy. Because posterior instrumentation is usually needed to provide stability following corpectomy and spinal cord decompression, posterolateral approaches to spinal cord decompression have gained favor in recent years. Posterolateral decompression offers advantages over the combined anterior and posterior approach, reducing operative time, morbidity, and hospital stay. Drawbacks to traditional posterolateral decompressions include poor visualization of the tumor immediately anterior to the spinal cord and the need to manipulate the spinal cord to completely remove a tumor adherent to the dura. Endoscopically assisted posterolateral decompression allows decompression of the anterior surface of the spinal cord, the point of pressure in most circumstances. Endoscopic video assistance facilitates vertebrectomy, cord decompression, and anterior reconstruction, all performed through the same posterior incision. Endoscopic assisted spinal cord decompression dramatically reduces morbidity, ICU requirements, and inpatient hospitalization and has proven useful for a variety of metastatic tumors at every level of the spinal column.","1230":"The degenerative processes in an aging spine have been defined traditionally only by our knowledge of the biology of disc and facet degeneration, as well as interpretation of post-mortem cryosections by forensic anatomist Wolfgang Rauschning, M.D. In this chapter, visualization of in-vivo patho-anatomy in a degenerating disc and spinal segment is demonstrated at surgery using the Yeung Endoscopic Spine System (Y.E.S.S.), (Richard Wolf Surgical Instrument Company, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved study of endoscopic treatment for degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine incorporated intraoperative probing under local anesthesia and endoscopic treatment of the visualized patho-anatomy. An intraoperative evocative chromo-discogram, using indigocarmine, was used to elicit discogenic pain and label the fissured and degenerative nucleus pulposus for surgical removal and thermal modulation. Painful patho-anatomy was probed in a conscious patient. The most common endoscopic finding was Inflammatory tissue in the disc and annulus. Inflammation was correlated with the presence of annular tears. Patho-physiologic changes that affect the exiting nerve, which contains the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG), was associated with stenotic and chemical irritation. Unavoidable postoperative dysesthesia was associated with the presence of an inflammatory membrane, and removal or thermal coagulation of \"anomalous\" furcal nerves in the foramen that branched off of the exiting spinal nerve. Neo-angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the inflammatory membrane present in the foraminal triangle was a new finding not reported in traditional clinical studies. Visualization and treatment of pathologic findings inside (annular tears) and outside the disc in Herniated Nucleus Pulposus (HNP), synovial cysts, foraminal stenosis, central stenosis, spondylolisthesis, is demonstrated. The endoscopic foraminal approach to the spine and disc is a technique that provides access to patho-anatomy in the lumbar spine not usually feasible with traditional surgical methods. Favorable surgical results allow for continued evolution of the endoscopic method, concomitant with the continued evolution of endoscopic spinal surgery.","1231":"In response to the rapid development and demand of outpatient endoscopic minimally invasive lumbar surgical technique, the SMART endoscopic spine system was developed for neurodecompression. This lumbar spine surgery is performed with a small skin incision, dilatation surgical technology, and an endoscopic-assisted spinal surgical system with progressive serial tubular retractors providing superior lighting and better visualization of the operative field for performing minimally invasive spinal surgery (MISS). The SMART system incorporates the advantages of posterior paramedian endoscopic assisted microdecompressive surgical spinal system and posterolateral endoscopic lumbar system. This versatile SMART endoscopic spine system with various sized working channels provides a generous and optimal access for endoscopic MISS of microdecompression of herniated lumbar disc, degenerative spinal disease, spinal stenosis, and removal of intraspinal lesions as well as creating an access for spinal arthroplasty and spinal fixation. With the unique features of the SMART system, the surgeon can take advantage of microscopic, endoscopic, or direct vision for microdecompressive spinal surgery, bridging endoscopic and conventional spinal surgery. It appears easy, safe, and efficacious. This less traumatic and easier outpatient MISS treatment leads to excellent result speedier recovery, and significant economic savings. The SMART endoscopic spine system, surgical indications, operative techniques, and the potential complications and their avoidance are described and discussed herein.","1232":"Optimized pulsed electrical stimulation (PES) regulates chondrocyte genes, enhances production of cartilage matrix materials, and inhibits production of matrix catabolic factors. This prospective, cohort study examined the use of a PES device in treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in patients who had failed non-operative therapy. Primary outcome measures were patient and physician global evaluation, and patient assessment of knee pain. This study included 288 (95 men, 193 women) patients who used the device from 16 to more than 600 days (mean: 889 hours). Improvement in all efficacy variables (p &lt; 0.001) occurred. A dose-response relationship between effect size and hours of usage was observed as cumulative time increased to more than 750 hours. Improvement in patient or physician global occurred in 59.0% of patients who used it less than 750 hours, and for 73.0% of those who used it more than 750 hours. An economic analysis of a sub-group of patients showed that 45.3% reduced nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use by 50.0% or more. A highly optimized PES device successfully attenuated knee OA symptoms in patients who had failed non-surgical therapy. Less than 250 hours of therapy provided relief, but improvement increased in a dose-response manner after 750 hours of cumulative use. ","1233":"Inability to achieve adequate range of motion (ROM) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) represents a frustrating complication for both patient and surgeon. Manipulation under anesthesia is indicated in TKA having less than 90 degrees ROM after six weeks, with no progression or regression in ROM. A modified technique has evolved for patients with chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) symptoms or persistent stiffness after standard manipulation. A retrospective review was conducted to determine the efficacy of the modified technique, which uses epidural anesthesia continued for postoperative analgesia, hospital stay of one to three days, continuous passive motion (CPM) for two to three days, and daily physical therapy (PT). Between 1997 and 2003, 5714 TKAs were performed in 4106 patients. Manipulation using a standard technique was performed on 334 (5.8%) knees in 273 patients. Manipulation using a modified technique was performed on 65 (1%) knees in 60 patients. Age averaged 58 years and body mass index (BMI) averaged 34.39. Follow up averaged 18.4 months. ROM improved significantly from 71 degrees to 102 degrees (p &lt; 0.0001). Knee Society pain, function, and total clinical scores all improved significantly (all p &lt; 0.0001). Successful results were observed in 48 (74%) knees. Four (6%) additional knees achieved a successful result after a subsequent manipulation. Nine (14%) knees required component revision for treatment of persistent arthrofibrosis, which included one full revision, five polyethylene exchanges, and three revisions of femoral component and polyethylene. Two significant complications occurred: one subdural hematoma and one death due to pulmonary embolism. Although not without complications, manipulation under epidural anesthesia represents a viable option for treatment of persistent stiffness after TKA; 80% of these difficult cases achieved successful results.","1234":"The use of large-diameter femoral heads in total hip arthroplasty appears to reduce the risk for dislocation, and potentially improve articular wear. Moreover, large-diameter total hip femoral heads have been determined to increase range of motion. The purpose of this study was to report our experiences with this new device. In our patient cohort, many patients have done extremely well in the short-term with this new device, and it seems these patients function better than those with a standard total hip arthroplasty. The patients who experience less pain are able to return to full activities postoperatively. The preliminary results of this study are encouraging, and large femoral head prosthesis appears to be a great choice for orthopaedic surgeons in primary total hip arthroplasty.","1235":"Among the 123 patients treated in our department by endovascular stent graft, 113 (91.8%) were identified as having involvement of the isthmus. Therefore, the incorrectly defined descending aortic disease is essentially a pathology of the isthmus that represents the distal portion of the arch. The key to the treatment of all types of aortic lesions rests on understanding the morphology of this region gifted with a \"double S\" configuration. Current thoracic devices are noncompliant systems and should be modified greatly, taking into account that the media of the aorta has a semi-compliant behavior. The resultant of power transmission is oriented at 45 degrees and produces a transmural radial force that animal implantation has demonstrated to be a torsional movement. The improvements in new devices actually result in a new generation of endoprostheses that seem to be closely related to the anatomy of the patient by increasing the conformability and, therefore, we expect an increase in durability. To test these features, we have studied a new stent graft in different settings of thoracic aortic disease. The new device should conform to current standards while simultaneously transmitting torsional forces. The dedicated delivery system should be arch-compatible, flexible but sufficiently rigid, and able to be three-dimensionally oriented. Moreover, the new stent graft should follow the three-dimensional anatomy of the \"double S\" configuration of the isthmus area and thus reduce the mismatch between the aorta and the device itself.","1236":"In recent years, the focus in peri-operative care of cardiac patients has shifted from trying to create a stress-free environment to hasten the recovery of patients by providing early extubation, early mobilization, and enteral nutrition. Fast-track cardiac surgery has therefore made a paradigm shift in postoperative care. However, evidence on the safety of early postoperative mobilization in high-risk groups like aortic valve replacement surgery is lacking. Physiological evidence from controlled studies in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) showed that heart rate increases and stroke volume falls with maintenance of cardiac output. However, the increase of 50% to 60% of oxygen consumption during mobilization is covered by increased oxygen extraction, resulting in marked mixed venous oxygen desaturation. These physiological changes during postoperative mobilization were also seen in CABG patients. The mobilization pattern was also maintained on the second day after surgery. No serious side effects were observed in the controlled trials of mobilization of AVR patients after cardiac surgery. Over a 13-year period, we have mobilized more than 1200 AVR patients. No serious situations have occurred during or in direct connection to mobilization.","1237":"During the last 50 years, there has been an exponential increase in our understanding of the structure and function of the mitral valve in health and disease. Large numbers of patients have undergone mitral-valve reparative procedures worldwide with variable results. In our initial 10-year experience in which traditional techniques were used for repair of mitral regurgitation, a 70% success rate was achieved. In 1995, a critical reappraisal of the common causes of failure to repair, or failure of repair and developed improved surgical approaches for these patients began. The conditions addressed were massive bileaflet prolapse (\"Barlow's valves\"); anterior leaflet prolapse; multisegment chordal failure; commissural accessory leaflet tissue prolapse; and leaflet destruction by endocarditis. A widely applicable standard technique was developed that the author and colleagues called the \"American Correction.\" It emphasizes chordal replacement with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) artificial chordae, importance of the line of apposition of the leaflets, and importance of simultaneous dynamic adjustment of the chordal length and anteroposterior dimension of the mitral annulus. In addition, use of multiple techniques in 30% of patients to complete the repair has been emphasized. These techniques resulted in a 90% repairability rate for all pathologies and 100% for myxomatous-mitral insufficiency. These techniques also have led to a decline in reoperation rates, and improved long-term durability. Continued evaluation with intraoperative and postoperative three-dimensional (3-D) echo provides further insights and refinement of mitral-repair techniques.","1238":"Since the 2002 Surgical Technology International monograph on valvular prostheses, there have been significant developmental and investigative advances. Aortic bioprostheses and mechanical prostheses have undergone design changes to optimize hemodynamics and prevent patient-prosthesis mismatch to have a potential satisfactory influence on survival. There has been continual technological improvements striving to bring forward advances that improve the durability of bioprostheses and reduce the thrombogenicity of mechanical prostheses. There also has been a continuance to preserve biological tissue with glutaraldehyde, rather than clinically evaluate other cross-linking technologies, by controlling or retarding calcification with therapies to control phospholipids and residual aldehydes. The techniques of mitral valve reconstruction have now been well established and new annuloplasty rings have been designed for the potential of maintaining the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the mitral annulus. Several objectives exist for annuloplasty, namely remodeling of the length and shape of the dilated annulus, prevention of dilatation of the annulus, and support for the potentially fragile area after partial-leaflet resection. Currently, there exists an emergence of catheter-based therapies for management of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. For management of selected populations with critical aortic stenosis, techniques for aortic valve substitution have been developed for both antegrade and retrograde catheter techniques, as well as apical transventricular implantation. Mitral regurgitation has been addressed by experimental transcoronary sinus, stent-like devices and transventricular, edge-to-edge leaflet devices. The devices, descriptions and pictorial images comprise this monograph.","1239":"Laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) is an increasingly accepted method of treatment for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas. It affords patients a minimally invasive surgery compared to the more traditional abdominal approach. Studies have shown the benefits of decreased blood loss, shorter hospital stay and recovery period, as well as decreased postoperative pain and fever in comparison to abdominal myomectomy (AM). Even myomas larger than 5 cm can be laparoscopically resected safely in the hands of an experienced surgeon. To date, studies indicate a decreased adhesion rate with the laparoscopic approach compared to the abdominal procedure. The use of adhesion barriers may decrease this rate further. In infertile women with myomas, pregnancy and live-birth rates improve following LM, and appear to be comparable with those rates achieved following AM. The data regarding the risk of uterine rupture in pregnancy following LM is limited. However, small studies show safe outcomes when patients are managed with the same degree of caution one might employ with post-abdominal myomectomy patients. In performing LM, a precise and diligent technique should be exercised to ensure a secure, multilayer closure.","1240":"We investigated the feasibility and outcome of adhesiolysis in patients with severe and reccurent adhesions using lift (gasless) laparoscopy and a SprayGel adhesion barrier at the Institute for Endoscopic Gynecology (EndoGyn). The design included a prospective evaluation of lift (gasless) laparoscopic adhesiolysis in combination with a SprayGel adhesion barrier. A new score for bowel adhesions was developed and applied. All 35 patients with severe and reccurent adhesions underwent a lift-laparoscopic adhesiolysis with the Abdo-Lift and SprayGel adhesion barrier, a second-look laparoscopy at Day 7 and, in case of continuation of pain, a third-look laparoscopy within 6 months after the initial surgery. All patients were operated upon without conversion to laparotomy. The reduction in the adhesion score of adhesions at the second-look laparoscopy was overall (sum) 89.8% (90.1% reduction in extent, 89.3% reduction in severity, and 89.9% reduction in grade). Five patients (14.3%) had a third-look laparoscopy within 6 months after the initial surgery, in which four cases of adhesion reformation were confirmed. However, the scores were reduced compared to the initial surgery, especially in grade (94.2%) and severity (93.2%). In these analyses, SprayGel was uniquely effective in improving the success rates of adhesiolysis when combined with lift (gasless) laparoscopy and good hemostasis techniques. Adhesiolysis with Abdo-Lift and SprayGel had unparalleled efficacy in the adhesiolysis procedure even in those patients in whom other solutions have not worked. An overall reduction of adhesions by 89.9% at second-look laparoscopy was found. Even if five patients (14.3%) required a third-look laparoscopy where four cases of adhesion reformation were confirmed, the scores were reduced when compared to the initial surgery, especially in grade and severity.","1241":"We have reported the experience of two referral laparoscopic gynecologic centers in Italy considering the results of almost 1000 laparoscopic myomectomies, including complication rate and fertility outcome. From January 1991 to December 2003, a total of 982 single or multiple laparoscopic myomectomies (LM) were performed. Indications were infertility, recent and significant uterine enlargement, and other symptoms such as pelvic pain, menometrorrhagia, and abnormal bleeding. All surgical procedures were performed by three surgeons in two different endoscopic centers. Surgery outcome and information about subsequent fertility and obstetric outcome were reported. Myomectomies were performed using a standard technique with three ancillary suprapubic ports. In cases of deep intramural myomas, we injected the myomas with vasoconstrictive agents. A vertical incision of the serosa was made and mechanical enucleation of the myomas was performed whenever possible. A suture in one or two layers with large, curved needles (CT 1, 30 mm) swaged to polyglactin 1 or 0 sutures was performed. Extraction of the removed myomas took place with electric morcellation. Most patients (47%) had more than one myoma, with a maximum of eight per patient (average myomas removed for patients: 2.23). Myoma size ranged from 1 cm to 20 cm (average 67.20 mm +\/- 27.1 mm). Most of the myomas (75%) were intramural. The average drop in hemoglobin concentration was 1.06 g +\/- 0.86 g\/100 ml. The duration of the entire procedure ranged from 30 min to 360 min with a mean of 104.5 min. The conversion rate to laparotomy was 1.29% and no major intraoperative complications occurred. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.02 days +\/- 0.61 days and we had three serious postoperative complications. The overall rate of intrauterine pregnancy following LM was 62.53% and the abortion rate was 15.9%. Data suggest that laparoscopic myomectomy is a safe and reliable procedure, even in the presence of multiple or very enlarged myomas, with a low complication rate and satisfying long-term results.","1242":"Traditionally, the inguinal hernia repair is performed through an incision in the groin. Different kinds of operations are suggested as best repairs by using the patient's own tissue, or use of prosthetic mesh to reinforce the abdominal wall. The advent of the laparoscopic repair that also uses prosthetic mesh, made it even more complex to determine the best repair. Using the Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) principles, endpoints of the treatment are not only based on recurrence rates, but also on complications, patient satisfaction, convalescence, and costs. Several meta-analyses concluded that use of mesh is superior to the non-mesh operations. More difficult to determine is which mesh repair, open or laparoscopically, is the best. The laparoscopic repair is difficult and less suitable for general practice, but the open-mesh repair results in a higher percentage of chronic postoperative pain. Further research should be focused on making the laparoscopic repair less complicated, and development of new meshes for open surgery that reduce the amount of persistent postoperative pain.","1243":"Endoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty, TEP, has become an established technique for repair of inguinal hernia. The performance of TEP usually requires a number of disposable instruments. The high cost of these devices has been a deterrent to development of laparoscopic surgery. Success in cost containment is pivotal to enhance a wider application of TEP and benefit more patients, particularly in public hospitals. The differences in the design and material of disposable and reusable instruments account for distinction in their handling and safety attributes. Replacement of disposable instruments by reusable ones sometimes requires modification of surgical techniques. Reusable instruments are economically advantageous, but they require sterilization. Wear and tear of these reusable tools after multiple procedures sometimes causes unexpected problems during operation. This chapter reviews the pros and cons of reusable and disposable instruments for performance of TEP. The selection of reusable or disposable instruments should balance the cost of the procedure, convenience of the operation theatre, safety of the patient, and experience of the surgeon. Instruments, whether reusable or disposable, should offer value for money.","1244":"Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy using Surgisis (Cook Surgical, Bloomington, IN, USA) mesh is an effective long-term treatment for repair of inguinal hernia. Between August 1999 and April 2005, 67 patients underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair by the total extraperitoneal (TEP) mesh placement technique using Surgisis mesh. A total of 82 primary direct, indirect, pantaloon, and femoral hernias were repaired using this technique. Postoperative complications and recurrence as evaluated at two weeks, six weeks, three months, six months, one year, and yearly thereafter for up to five years. The operations were performed successfully on all the patients. One revision was done to an open procedure. Postoperative complications were typical of inguinal hernia surgery. Average follow up was 38 (range: 4-72, median: 35 months. Four non-technical recurrences following repair of direct hernias were reported, which indicates a 4.9% recurrence rate. No recurrences of indirect hernias were noted. Laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy using Surgisis mesh is effective in treatment of primary inguinal hernias in adults with minimal complications and recurrence up to five years of follow up. ","1245":"Minimally invasive surgery has undergone rapid development over the last 20 years and has greatly impacted the field of General Surgery. Removal of the appendix and gallbladder by way of laparoscopic means has become standard in surgical training and care. More complex procedures also are becoming incorporated into surgical resident education and routine clinical practice. Colon cancer operations, previously performed by an open approach to ensure adequate resection of the specimen and draining lymph nodes, are currently being performed laparoscopically by experienced surgeons with equivalent recurrence, morbidity, and overall mortality rates. In this chapter, the technique of laparoscopic colectomy is described and advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The literature is reviewed and this technique compared with the open procedure. The authors contend that laparoscopic colectomy is a suitable, and perhaps preferable, alternative to open procedures for benign or malignant colon disease, with acceptable long-term results.","1246":"More so than with other types of colon cancer, rectal cancer is associated with a range of laparoscopic surgical techniques. Treatment of cancer of the lower rectum requires favorable operative fields, minimal contact with the tumor during dissection, and delicate surgical procedures to avoid nerve damage. Such surgery thus requires immobilizing the trunk so the patient can be repositioned as needed, placing ports at appropriate locations, as well as careful handling of surgical equipment. To minimize the risk of disseminating cancer cells during the procedure, the surgery should be restricted to patients with early-stage cancer. The most difficult surgical procedure is resection of the lower rectum. While safe resection of the intestinal tract was difficult using previously available surgical equipment, newly developed equipment makes today's resections much safer and easier. Indications for surgical intervention should be broadened carefully, based on a deeper understanding of the surgical anatomy within the pelvis and on various relevant oncological and technical factors.","1247":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the most commonly undertaken procedures in General Surgery with more than 500,000 performed annually. Overall, the complication rate is less than 1.5%, and the mortality rate is less than 0.1%. As such, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was considered by most to be at its zenith since its inception in the early 1990 s. Advancements in technology and equipment have opened new doors to physicians and allowed the laparoscopic cholecystectomy to once again evolve. Traditional four-port cholecystectomy has given way to three- and even two-port techniques. Standard 12-mm ports have been replaced by 2-mm ports, and experiments have now been implemented to achieve cholecystectomy with no ports-known as the transgastric technique. The authors reviewed evolution of these techniques that included a synopsis of our experience with the three-port cholecystectomy, as well as the future direction of laparoscopic surgery.","1248":"The essential objectives for thyroidectomy are avoidance of injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs), conservation of the parathyroid glands, an accurate haemostasis, and an excellent cosmesis. In the last 10 years, major improvements and new technologies have been proposed and applied in thyroid surgery, among these mini-invasive thyroidectomy, regional anaesthesia, and intraoperative neuromonitoring. Moreover, new devices for achieving dissection and haemostasis have been proposed. The purpose of ligating vessels is to maintain the surgical site free from an excess of blood and reduce blood loss in patients. This chapter reviews relevant medical literature published in the English language since 1990 on thyroid surgery techniques with well-controlled trials on haemostasis and dissection. Searches were last updated October 2005.","1249":"The procedure of stapled hemorrhoidectomy has been established as a safe and effective method for treating symptomatic hemorrhoids not responsive to more conservative measures. This chapter discusses the issues of safety, efficacy, durability, and cost of this procedure. In addition, we outline techniques for performing the procedure safely and effectively.","1250":"The feasibility and safety of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding for treatment of morbid obesity has been demonstrated in a large number of studies. Access port-related complications constitute a significant part of all complications related to gastric banding. Further, adjustment of hydraulic gastric bands can be fairly lengthy, uncomfortable, and is not a precise procedure. A study was performed to assess the usefulness and efficacy of a new type of band adjusted telemetrically without the need for an access port. The initial worldwide results of the first telemetrically adjustable gastric band for morbid obesity (EASYBAND EndoArt Medical Technologies, Switzerland) in two German academic centers are described herein. EASYBAND is a purely mechanical gastric band, in which adjustment is achieved by means of an embedded micromotor, controlled by an external control unit using telemetry. The exact band diameter is displayed continuously during adjustment on the external control unit screen. Thirty-seven patients, means 36 +\/- 8 (range: 22-60) years, 7 (19%) men and 30 (81%) women, with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 44.1 +\/- 4.5 (range: 35.6-59.6), were implanted using the standard laparoscopic technique during the period from June 2005 to October 2005. Prospective data were collected on all morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic telemetrically adjustable gastric banding (LTAGB). No serious adverse events occurred during the operative period or immediately postoperatively in relation to the device. A mean of 3.0 +\/- 0.6 adjustments per patients were performed during the follow-up schedule at one, three and six months. The band diameter was set to 29 mm (fully open) at implantation, 24.5 mm +\/- 0.5 mm at one month, 23.3 mm +\/- 0.7 mm at three months, and 23.0 mm +\/- 1.0 mm at six months. The mean percent excess weight loss was 10.2% +\/- 4.5% at one month, 23.8% +\/- 8.8% at three months, and 30.2% +\/- 10.5% at six months. This initial study shows that the new telemetrically adjustable gastric banding device is implanted and operated safely, allows for atruamatic band adjustments with superior patient comfort, and leads to early excess weight loss comparable to that achieved by other gastric bands. Longer-term follows and larger population studies are needed to establish the final safety and performance profile of the telemetric gastric band. ","1251":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common pathologies treated by primary care physicians. Despite advances in antacid pharmacological treatments, many patients remain refractory to maximal medical therapy. In addition, many others are either unable to tolerate the side effects of the drugs or simply are unwilling to receive life-long daily medications. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has evolved as the surgical procedure of choice for patients with GERD. Although the durability of surgical management has been questioned, experienced surgeons achieve long-term reflux cure rates of about 85% to 95%. Barrett's esophagus has recently been considered an additional indication for surgical therapy of reflux due to evidence of dysplasia regression following a 360 degrees fundoplication. However, the timing of surgical intervention and the exact procedure for patients with both short- and long-segment Barrett's esophagus remains debatable. Esophageal dysmotility in surgical patients with GERD has traditionally been approached by \"tailoring\" the degree of fundoplication. Recent evidence suggests that partial fundoplication may not be effective and that full fundoplication should still be employed. The degree of dysmotility prohibitive to a full 360 degrees fundoplication remains controversial and should be addressed with future randomized trials. Finally, patients with failed fundoplication represent a formidable diagnostic dilemma and a technical challenge. In experienced hands, these patients can still benefit from minimally-invasive restorative or \"re-do\" fundoplications with minimal perioperative morbidity and good long-term results.","1252":"To evaluate the outcomes and initial results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and review of the literature. A retrospective analysis of the initial ten patients who underwent LSG was performed. Study endpoints included operative time, complication rates, hospital length of stay, and percentage of excess body weight loss. This study included five women and five men, with a mean age of 43 (range: 31-52) years. Their mean preoperative weight was 182 kg (range: 125 kg-247 kg), with a mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) of 64 (range: 61- 80). Indication for LSG was the importance of BMI in all patients. One patient had previous restrictive bariatric surgery. Mean operative time was two (range: 1.5-2.5) hours. No patients required conversion. No postoperative complications nor mortality were noted. The median hospital stay was 7.2 days. Average excess body weight loss and BMI at one year were 51% and 23 kg\/m2, respectively. LSG can be integrated safely into a bariatric treatment program with good results in terms of weight loss and quality of life. LSG can be a first-step procedure before gastric bypass or duodenal switch, or a one-step restrictive procedure if long-term results are good. LSG should be considered as a surgical option in the bariatric field, but further studies are needed to determine its exact use. ","1253":"The exclusive charge-coupled device (CCD) camera system for the endoscope and electronic fiberscopes are in widespread use. However, both are usually stationary in an office or examination room, and a wheeled cart is needed for mobility. The total costs of the CCD camera system and electronic fiberscopy system are at least US Dollars 10,000 and US Dollars 30,000, respectively. Recently, the performance of audio and visual instruments has improved dramatically, with a concomitant reduction in their cost. Commercially available CCD video cameras with small monitors have become common. They provide excellent image quality and are much smaller and less expensive than previous models. The authors have developed adaptors for the popular mini-digital video (mini-DV) camera. The camera also provides video and acoustic output signals; therefore, the endoscopic images can be viewed on a large monitor simultaneously. The new system (a mini-DV video camera and an adaptor) costs only US Dollars 1,000. Therefore, the system is both cost-effective and useful for the outpatient clinic or casualty setting, or on house calls for the purpose of patient education. In the future, the authors plan to introduce the clinical application of a high-vision camera and an infrared camera as medical instruments for clinical and research situations.","1254":"Intra-abdominal abscesses are one of the major complications that occur after Gastrointestinal Surgery. Therapeutic modalities include drainage and irrigation. This study describes the development of a new drainage and continuous irrigation system that results in less skin irritation and reduced dressing changes. This system involved the use of the Surgidrain open top (ALCARE, Tokyo, Japan), which consists of a sealing sheet with a drainage lumen and plastic cap. A double-lumen tube was inserted into the abscess cavity through a slit in the plastic cap. The abscess cavity could, therefore, be irrigated continuously through one lumen of the double-lumen tube, and most of the fluid could be drained through the second lumen of the double-lumen tube. Overflow fluid was drained through the Surgidrain open top drainage lumen. This system enabled better protection against skin complications and the ability to easily flush the abscess intermittently.","1255":"Diagnostic validity of sentinel node (SN) mapping has been recently introduced into the field of various solid tumors, including gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. In gastric cancer, acceptable detection rates of SNs, as well as sensitivity in detecting micrometastasis based on SN status, was reported using the dye-guided method, as well as the radio-guided method. Gastric cancer is currently one of the suitable targets of SN navigation surgery among visceral tumors. Despite the multi-directional and complicated lymphatic flow from gastric mucosa, the anatomical situation of the stomach is relatively suitable for SN mapping in comparison with organs embedded in closed spaces, such as the esophagus and rectum. In particular, clinically T1N0 gastric cancer seems to be a good entity for which to try to modify the therapeutic approach. From the data reported in the literature, micro-metastases tend to be limited within the sentinel basins in cT1N0 gastric cancer. Sentinel basins are, therefore, good targets of selective lymphadenectomy for cT1N0 gastric cancer with the potential risk of micrometastasis. Furthermore, laparoscopic local resection is theoretically feasible for curative treatment of SN negative early gastric cancer. For laparoscopic application of SN mapping of gastric cancer, a radio-guided method is essential. Although recent single institutional studies support the validity of the SN concept, a multi-centric prospective validation study based on a standardized protocol is essential for further clinical application. Currently, two major well-designed clinical trials of SN mapping for gastric cancer open surgery have been initiated in Japan. Radio-guided SN mapping for gastric cancer has a great potential to provide a new paradigm shift for surgical management of an early gastric cancer.","1256":"The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the beginning surgeon ultrasonographer to the use of ultrasound during laparoscopic surgery. The authors routinely use ultrasound in the intraoperative, endoscopic, and office settings. The importance of ultrasound in the various surgical specialties is well documented in the literature. Since the introduction of minimally invasive techniques to General Surgery, many advanced applications of ultrasonography have been developed. Confident examinations of intraabdominal anatomy, pathologic conditions, and therapeutic procedures can readily be performed. In this chapter, a comprehensive introduction to laparoscopic ultrasound is presented to the practicing General Surgeon. The basic equipment requirements and setup are explained. Fundamental techniques of laparoscopic ultrasound examination are described. The authors' method of screening for common bile duct stones during routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy is illustrated. Examination of the normal biliary tree with helpful hints is presented. The authors' systematic technique of visualizing the normal liver parenchyma is described. Common benign and malignant findings are elucidated. A brief synopsis of pancreatic ultrasonography with attention to pathologic findings is provided. Uses of ultrasound in unanticipated situations are introduced. With perseverance, the reader will discover that laparoscopic ultrasound skills can be readily attained.","1257":"Forced-air warming is known as an effective procedure in prevention and treatment of perioperative hypothermia. Hypothermia is associated with disturbances of coagulation, raises postoperative oxygen consumption by shivering, increases cardiac morbidity, leads to a higher incidence of wound infection, and prolongs hospital stay. Additionally, preoperative local warming reduces the incidence of wound infection after clean surgery. In an animal experiment it has been demonstrated that even during large abdominal operations the major source of heat loss was the skin. Although evaporation accounted for the largest heat loss from the abdominal cavity, it was a minor source due to the smaller heat losing area. As a consequence, reduction of heat loss from the skin is the most promising approach to avoid hypothermia. During abdominal surgery and lower-limb surgery, the use of upper blankets is favourable. The use of upper-body blankets implies a reduction of heat loss in a relevant area and, furthermore, a heat gain. The covered area is approximately 0.35 m2, or approximately 15%-20% of body surface. The heat balance in this area can be changed by 46.1W to 55.0W by forced-air warming systems with upper body blankets. Depending on the surgical procedure and resulting fluid demand, forced-air warming with upper-body blankets-in combination with insulation and fluid warming-is an effective method to prevent perioperative hypothermia.","1258":"Deformities of a totally burned face present a profound challenge to the reconstructive plastic surgeon. Skin grafting has been used traditionally for resurfacing with limited success, especially when the burns were so severe the deeper structures were destroyed. Total face reconstruction, using bilateral extended scapular free flap, has been reported previously for severe deformities following an extensive facial burn. Although this method obtained better aesthetic and functional results than skin grafting, the donor-site morbidity was relatively high, with a large scar that extended across the entire back. In addition, the nose needed to be reconstructed separately with a forehead flap or free radial forearm flap. The authors experienced a case in which a totally burned face was reconstructed successfully with a single free-expanded flap. A 54-year-old man sustained a severe facial burn with gasoline that involved the face, anterior neck, anterior chest, and bilateral upper extremities. Sequential debridement and skin grafting were required to close the burn wound. A tissue expander was inserted in his left back before the facial reconstruction. Six months after insertion of the tissue expander, the left dorsal skin was transferred to the face as one large flap, size 28x27 cm, with three sets of vascular anastomoses. The flap totally survived with abundant tissue at the central area to reconstruct the nose. With five complementary procedures, including a costal cartridge graft, the shape of the nose was restored, and acceptable functional and aesthetic results were obtained. This method did not require a separate tissue transfer for nasal reconstruction. To our knowledge, this is the first case of successful reconstruction with one flap for total face reconstruction that included the nose.","1259":"The objective of this case report is to discuss the possibility of developing a surgical treatment paradigm for patients with some of the noted characteristics of Treacher-Collins syndrome, mainly mandibular ankylosis and\/or retrognathia (mandibular retrusion), in a way that would provide lasting, predictable results and minimize the frequently seen mandibular ankylosis. Through various medical imaging techniques, mainly computed tomography (CT) scan, the radiology imaging technologist produces accurate CT scan images of the particular patient's osseous cranial structures. These images can then be used by the stereolithography (SLA) technician to construct accurate SLA models. The SLA models can then be used by the surgical and implant design team to not only prescribe the surgical correction necessary, but also design and construct the actual temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and mandibular implants, as well as perform mock surgery, which will be needed to restore function and esthetics for the patient. The early results from this alloplastic reconstructive surgery have provided the anticipated results of relieving the ankylosis, improving jaw function and frequently dental occlusion, as well as improving the esthetics. Without this breakthrough surgical development, many of these Treacher-Collins syndrome patients will not be able to enjoy normal breathing, mastication, jaw function, esthetics, oral and dental health, and the emotional relief these corrections allow. Many patients who suffer the disfiguring and functionally damaging affects of Treacher-Collins syndrome never receive the surgical correction necessary. Many have had autogenous reconstruction of missing mandibular and TMJ structures, only to sometimes relapse into a more disfiguring and lasting condition. By simply placing a Christensen Fossa-Eminence Prosthesis(r) (TMJ Implants, Inc., Golden CO, USA) between the cranial base and any bone graft, one is more likely to achieve satisfactory TMJ mobility. If a condylar or mandibular reconstruction is necessary, the Christensen Total TMJ Prostheses(r) (TMJ Implants, Inc., Golden CO, USA) are available and provide excellent results.","1260":"Fusions of the cervical and lumbar spine are often followed within months or several years by protrusion of discs at the adjacent level or levels. Biomechanical alterations and mobility lost at the fused levels are thought to be transferring the stress to the adjacent segments or discs, which results in accelerated degeneration of the discs and causes disc protrusion. This post-spinal fusion \"junctional disc herniation syndrome\" (JDHS), or the post-spinal fusion \"adjacent segment disease (ASD)\" can occur from 15% to 52% of post-spinal fusion, in both superior and\/or inferior adjacent levels. The ways in which endoscopic minimally invasive spinal discectomy procedure can be used to treat this JDHS and preserve spinal segmental motion are discussed herein. Also, case illustrations are presented.","1261":"Management of patients following extensive orthopaedic surgery, and in particular, joint replacement surgery, represents a continuing challenge. The associated bed rest burdens a broad range of physiologic functions, exacerbating vascular, venous, and lymphatic conditions, as well as cardiovascular conditions and glucose regulation in the hyperglycemic or diabetic patient. Most of these problems arise from a lack of mobility\/exercise during recuperation. In a recent series of clinical studies, non-invasive micromechanical stimulation (MMS) of the plantar surface has been demonstrated to significantly enhance skeletal muscle pump activity in the lower limbs of patients, which results in improved blood and lymphatic flow in the lower body. These studies demonstrate efficacy in both the supine and upright positions, suggesting the potential of MMS technology to significantly improve post-surgical patient care. Moreover, evidence is increasing that sustained skeletal muscle pump activity helps to maintain normal fluid flow in bone tissue, such that MMS may provide a non-drug treatment for maintaining bone mass during bed rest, or possibly increasing bone mass following extended bed rest.","1262":"Percutaneous vertebral augmentation (VA) and reconstruction with intravertebral polyethylene mesh sac (OptiMesh) and morcelized bone graft provided a minimally invasive efficacious and controlled delivery mechanism to stabilize and treat painful osteoporotic, traumatic and neoplastic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), as well as avoided serious complications from Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) of Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty. Osteoconductive and osteoinductive and can be used to create biologic vertebral reconstruction. The adjacent vertebra integrity should be more protected by the construct with a similar elasticity and physical characteristics of the morcelized bone, more matched to that of adjacent bone than PMMA. The indications and surgical techniques are described herein.","1263":"Fifty primary total knee arthroplasties were performed in a prospective, randomized study comparing the use of a bipolar sealer device versus conventional electrocautery as the method of hemostasis. Both cohorts were evaluated for intraoperative blood loss, transfusion rate, postoperative drainage, hemoglobin levels, and Knee Society scores. A significant reduction in postoperative and total blood loss was found (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively), as well as an absence of tissue charring and smoke production in the bipolar sealer group. No difference in knee scores was found between both cohorts. These results suggest that use of this bipolar sealing device is at least as effective as standard cautery devices and can reduce blood loss, tissue damage, and smoke production in total knee arthroplasties without affecting the results.","1264":"Currently, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most successful orthopaedic surgeries. However, the results are inferior in patients with previous patellectomy because of anteroposterior instability, residual pain, and loss of the mechanical advantage of the patella. The moment arm of the quadriceps can be restored by bone grafting the patellar tendon, and thus regaining the benefits of an intact patella that results in a better outcome after TKA. Usually it requires an additional procedure with its associated co-morbidities to harvest the bone graft. As the bone graft has to articulate with the femoral prosthesis, it has to be smooth at least on one side. The authors have described a new technique in this Chapter by which bone grafting of the patellar tendon can be achieved with use of the tibial plateau obtained from the routine tibial cut during TKA. Tibial eminence can be used as the interfacetal ridge of the \"created\" patella.","1265":"The vast majority of femoral revisions that an orthopaedic surgeon encounters can be treated successfully with an extensively porous coated stem. Long-term results have demonstrated that this type of implant can provide reliable initial fixation with a high propensity for long-term fixation. Depending on the degree of femoral bone loss (Paprosky Type IIIA or Type IIIB bone), a longer cementless stem may be required to obtain initial axial and rotational stability. If severe bone loss is present (Paprosky Type IV bone), large canal diameters are encountered (&gt;19 mm), or if torsion remodeling of the proximal femur has occurred, alternative methods of fixation may be required.","1266":"In addition to conventional and endovascular techniques, laparoscopic surgery is becoming a third way to treat patients with aortoiliac occlusive or aneurysmal diseases. Several different laparoscopic techniques are available, but most authors are stressing the need for development of specific laparoscopic aortic instruments, to decrease the operative and clamping times and reduce the learning curve. Our experience of more than 150 patients who underwent a laparoscopic abdominal or thoracic aortic reconstruction, has lead us to imagine the instruments that may facilitate these procedures, and then to create a society with Vascular Surgeons and Biomedical Engineers, called PROTOMED, which may conceive, develop, and test new medical instruments. This Chapter presents an overview of what is available currently, such as laparoscopic aortic clamps or laparoscopic intestinal retractors; others are in the experimental stage, such as laparoscopic aortic staplers, anastomotic devices, and robotic surgical systems. This important technologic challenge should lead to 2 major orientations: development of qualitative in vitro and in vivo experiments to test these new products, and training courses to teach their use. Minimally aggressive techniques are well adapted to a western population growing older and has access to constantly improving medical care; however, only specific and ergonomic instruments will allow these new techniques to be widely embraced by the vascular surgical community.","1267":"Aortic aneurysms continue to be a major source of morbidity and mortality despite advances in operative and perioperative technology. Endovascular stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has been widely adopted since its initial report in 1991. Improvements in device delivery systems and development of modular bifurcated stent grafts have greatly facilitated repair, and broadened the applicability of these techniques. However, aneurysmal involvement of critical branch vessels can be problematic. Experience is growing with custom-made branched endografts to maintain antegrade perfusion to critical arteries in treatment of thoracoabdominal and complex aortoiliac aneurysms. The use of branched devices allows for extension of the sealing and fixation portions of the graft into more stable aorta, while simultaneously maintaining branch vessel patency. Much remains to be learned regarding the long-term durability of these repairs; however, as additional devices are developed, it is evident that the limitations of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair will continue to diminish.","1268":"This clinical feasibility study was planned to evaluate pericardioscopy as a means of control of the pericardial cavity during drainage for pericardial effusion by a surgical sub xyphoid approach. Seventeen patients who underwent an operation for surgical drainage of the pericardium (11 medical and 6 postoperative pericardial effusions) benefited from a pericardial exploration with a mediastinoscope or rigid thoracoscope (Karl Storz, Germany). In 7 of the 11 medical cases, a severe inflammation of the pericardium associated with false membranes was visualized; in 3 cases, the pericardium was considered as normal; and in 1 case, pericardial metastases were visualized. In the 6 postoperative cases, clots were visualized with a venous bypass graft and the pulmonary cannula of a right ventricular assist device (Thoratec, USA) was also perfectly controlled. The cause of bleeding was reported in one case and suspected in another, but required total sternotomy for repair in both cases. No mortality or morbidity was reported to be directly due to the technique. The peroperative assessment of pericardial cavity is possible by use of pericardioscopy with a satisfactory resolution, but visualization of the left lateral part of the heart remains difficult. The possibility exists to partially remove clots and false membranes, obtain various samples, and control the position of the drains. Improvement in the optic device with the possibility of a flexible device that has a tip protector for optimal visualization, may improve both the technique and results.","1269":"Stentless mitral valve (SMV) replacement is an intriguing concept to preserve the functionality of the physiological mitral valve (MV). Beginning in August 1997 to date, 51 patients, 35 females and 16 males (age: 68.3+\/-8.4 years), with severe MV disease (stenosis 25, incompetence 17, mixed lesion 9) received a chordally supported SMV. SMV implantation was performed using a conventional sternotomy in 32, or a minimally invasive lateral minithoracotomy approach in 19 of the patients. Mean valve size was 29+\/-1.5 mm; cross-clamp duration was 81+\/-33 min. The perioperative mortality rate was comparable to conventional MV repair or replacement. Regular echocardiographic control disclosed good SMV function (Vmax 1.7+\/-0.2 m\/s, Pmean 3.9+\/-1.2 mmHg) and well-preserved ejection fraction postoperatively, as well as at their most recent follow-up visit. SMV implantation by way of a sternotomy or lateral minithoracotomy leads to preservation of the annulo-ventricular continuity and similar to physiological hemodynamics. However, long-term durability remains to be proven.","1270":"Endoscopic bypass grafting can be complicated by limited intraoperative orientation. A method to overlay the preoperative model of the coronary tree on the live endoscopic images of the heart was therefore developed. The method is three-fold: (1) the three-dimensional (3D) model of the coronary tree is reconstructed from traditional angiograms; (2) preoperative images are registered with the intraoperative position of the patient in the operating room (OR); and (3) an iterative and interactive identification of clinically relevant landmarks within the operative field on the heart surface before their registration with the preoperative model of the coronaries. This algorithm allows one to compensate deformations (breathing, intraoperative heart shift) and leads to a precise overlay of the coronary network on the heart surface. For ergonomic reasons, the 3D model can be displayed directly within the visual field of any telesurgical master console. It thus provides an effective navigational aid to the surgeon similar to a global positioning system (GPS) in vehicles. Animal trials have been performed using the Da Vinci (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) teleoperated system to validate the method. Qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrate the potential value during total endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting.","1271":"Many lasers are widely used in urological surgery for several applications. Their use to treat the superficial bladder cancer (SBC) is safe and minimally invasive. The Holmium:YAG (Ho:YAG) laser represents the pinnacle of laser technology in Urology. The authors carried out this study on safety, efficacy, complication rates, postoperative catheterization time, and hospital stay of high-risk patients who underwent Ho:YAG vs. transurethral resection (TUR). Two groups of high-risk patients with SBC and comorbidities underwent either Ho:YAG or TUR. Different clinical aspects of the tumours and recurrences were considered. No significant difference between the two groups was noted regarding number, progression of grade and stage and place and time of recurrences. In the Ho:YAG patients, perioperative complications occurred at a lower percent than in the TUR group. Also, in 54% of patients, the catheter was removed within 24 hours; 76% had a postoperative hospital stay of 24 to 48 hours. In the TUR patients: 4% had the catheter removed within 24 hours and 6% left the hospital within 24 to 48 hours. In SBC treatment, Ho:YAG and TUR were equally as effective; the Ho:YAG laser was associated with shorter catheterization time and hospital stay. These Ho:YAG features could be advantageous from a psychological standpoint, particularly for elderly, high-risk patients and in terms of cost:benefit ratios.","1272":"A new surgical technique, the inside-out transobturator tension-free urethral suspension (TVT-Obturator), has been developed for treatment of women suffering from stress urinary incontinence (SUI). This simple procedure uses specifically designed surgical instruments to allow the accurate passage of a synthetic tape from underneath the urethra, through the obturator foramens, toward the thigh folds, with the tape being positioned without tension under the junction between mid and distal urethra. Cadaver dissection studies have demonstrated that the anatomical trajectory of the tape in tissues is strictly perineal and consistently coursed away from neighboring neurovascular structures, including the obturator, femoral, and saphenous nerves and vessels, as well as the pudendal nerve. Consequently, as opposed to retropubic sling systems, no perioperative cystoscopy is required because the TVT-O tape does not enter the pelvic region at any time during the procedure. These anatomical data, which suggest the TVT-O technique is safe, have been corroborated by initial clinical experience. Our feasibility and ongoing efficacy studies have shown that TVT-O is associated with a low incidence of perioperative and postoperative complications. In our current series of more than 500 consecutive patients treated with TVT-O, no injury to the bladder or urethra was encountered and no perineal or obturator hematoma, heavy bleeding, or neurological complication was observed. Medium-term results have suggested that TVT-O is as efficient as retropubic tension-free slings for treatment of female SUI, with +\/-90% complete cure rates after one-year follow up.","1273":"Management of the tubal factor could have the most difficult and debatable role in infertility management. The methods used ranged from gaseous insufflation, hydrotubation, laparotomy, and traditional microsurgery to the more recent tactile or hysteroscopic catheterization, and laparoscopic surgery. Results of the in-vitro-fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) were compared to the surgical procedures' results and the debate continues: shall we proceed directly to assisted reproductive techniques or should surgery be tried first in tubal obstructions?","1274":"The objective of this Chapter was to investigate the feasibility and outcome of gasless laparoscopy under regional anesthesia. A prospective evaluation of Lift-(gasless) laparoscopic procedures under regional anesthesia (Canadian Task Force classification II-1) was done at three endoscopic gynecology centers (franchise system of EndGyn(r)). Sixty-three patients with gynecological diseases comprised the cohort. All patients underwent Lift-laparoscopic surgery under regional anesthesia: 10 patients for diagnostic purposes, 17 for surgery of ovarian tumors, 14 to remove fibroids, and 22 for hysterectomies. All patients were operated without conversion to general anesthesia and without perioperative or anesthesiologic complications. Lift-laparoscopy under regional anesthesia can be recommended to all patients who desire laparoscopic intervention without general anesthesia. For elderly patients, those with cardiopulmonary risks, during pregnancy, or with contraindications for general anesthesia, Lift-laparoscopy under regional anesthesia should be the procedure of choice.","1275":"The objective of this chapter is to evaluate the magnitude of the problems of adhesions in Gynecology, complications, cost for the health care, and methods to prevent adhesion formation. It contains a review of relevant literature on intra-abdominal adhesion, adhesion-reducing substances, and their related cost. Adhesions can cause infertility, abdominal pain, or bowel obstruction. The impact of adhesions to the health-care system is huge. The total cost of adhesion-related problems in the United States is more than dollar 1 billion dollars annually. Modification in surgical technique, such as the use of laparoscopy, can minimize adhesion formation. Another approach is by using adhesion-reducing substances. Many substances and materials have been used to decrease the adhesion formation; however, there remains no unequivocally effective adhesion-reducing substance. Also, its use is costly. To our knowledge, no study has been published to date that addresses the use of adhesion-reducing substances as relates to the risk of bowel obstruction or long-term costs to the health-care system.","1276":"Our intent was to evaluate whether laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and a high degree of liver damage has a role to play in the management of the disease. Laparoscopic and hand-assisted laparoscopic radiofrequency ablations were performed on five patients and the short-range outcome and complications of these patients were evaluated. The evaluation of the primary liver tumor by the radiofrequency ablation was carried out by computed tomography on the seventh day after surgery. Three patients underwent laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation, and the other two patients underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation. The Child-Pugh status of all tumors was B status, and one patient had complications due to postoperative ascites. Laparoscopic and hand-assisted laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation with a cooled-tip electrode needle was found to be a safe and effective local treatment of hepatic focal lesions.","1277":"We present our experience with the use of the intraluminal stapler device for the purpose of creating of a permanent dermal colostomy in patients requiring acute emergency operations and for regularly scheduled procedures. The advantages of this method for surgeons who use stapling devices are controlled safety of the colostomy, reduced operation time, and the creation of a stable diameter of the colostomy. Furthermore, this method can be used in patients where a secondary operation is needed due to shrinkage or stricture of the primary colostomy during the first operation. This method has now been used in our clinic for five years with excellent results. All patients, including those having procedures related to colon cancer, are placed on a follow up protocol for three years and are closely monitored. This protocol has allowed us to closely follow these patients and any related complications such as stricture, stenosis, prolapse, in situ hernia, and ecstomosis.","1278":"Patients who undergo colorectal surgery are at a substantially higher risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) than their general surgery counterparts. The incidence of DVT in colorectal surgery patients who do not receive prophylaxis is approximately 30%; a four-fold increase exists in the incidence of pulmonary embolism. The precise reasons for the increased risk are uncertain; likely, contributing factors are the need for pelvic dissection, patient positioning (eg, use of stirrups), and indications for surgery (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer). Despite the clear evidence that supports the safety and efficacy of DVT prophylaxis, appropriate preventive measures are frequently not used. Heparin preparations and mechanical compression in combination likely represents the most appropriate prophylactic regimen in these high-risk patients. Standard heparin appears to be as effective as low-molecular-weight heparin and considerably less costly. In the presence of relatively poor adherence to consensus guidelines for prophylaxis, critical pathways or electronic alerts may be useful to facilitate compliance with appropriate preventive measures.","1279":"With a growing understanding of abdominal wall mechanics and improving surgical technology, inguinal herniorrhaphy has undergone significant advancements in the past 100 years. As primary repair through an anterior approach gave way to the \"tension-free\" Lichtenstein technique in the later part of the 20th century, hernia recurrence rates fell dramatically. With this fall in recurrence rates, other postoperative factors became the measure of herniorrhaphy technique quality. The reductions of postoperative pain and recovery time have become the basis for comparison between techniques. To that end, the plug and patch methods of Millikan and Rutkow, as well as the Kugel memory recoil mesh repair system, adhere to the philosophy of minimal dissection and suturing. The Prolene Hernia System was similarly created to simplify hernia repair while improving postoperative recovery. The posterior approach to hernia fixation was well-described in the late 1800s. Although generally underused, this technique offered an excellent option for repairing all inguinal hernias, especially incarcerated ones. By combining the perspective of preperitoneal repair with laparoscopic technology, a truly novel option for herniorrhaphy was created. Laparoscopy offers lower recurrence and postoperative complication rates than standard primary open repair, with the potential for a faster and more comfortable recovery than the \"tension-free\" open repair.","1280":"Biliary stone disease is a common disorder, usually associated with stones in the gallbladder, and can cause significant complications. Formations of stone usually occur in the presence of the following factors: abnormalities of the bile constituents, bile stasis, and the presence of nidus for stone formations. Numerous reports exist of foreign bodies (FBs) acting as nidus for stone formations within the biliary system. The FBs reported include surgical sutures, surgical clips, fragments of metal and plastics, ingested materials, and parasites. Surgical clips are reported to be the most commonly reported FBs that induce iatrogenic biliary stones. Surgical clips migration with subsequent stone formation is a well-recognized phenomenon since first used in surgery. Patients typically are first seen with symptoms of biliary obstruction and can be complicated by life-threatening cholangitis. These can occur from days to years after the initial surgical procedures. The underlying mechanism of the way in which FBs-including surgical clips-end up in the biliary system is unknown. Direct introduction during surgery, penetrating injuries, entero-bilio reflux, or erosions with eventual migration into the biliary system have been postulated. Bile-duct injuries, inappropriate clip placements, sub-clinical bile leak, and infections also have been postulated to contribute to clip migration. This Chapter reviews the literature regarding iatrogenic biliary stones as a result of FBs, and discusses the likely mechanisms involved with their migrations, stone formations, clinical presentations, and managements.","1281":"This chapter addresses emergent endoluminal technologies available currently for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). To date, the mainstay of GERD therapy has been achieved with either open or laparoscopic fundoplication, or life-long medical treatment. Endoluminal treatment modalities attempt to augment the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) function by various techniques. We searched the PubMed database from 1980 to 2005 for studies on endoscopic GERD techniques. Product investigators were contacted for data presented mainly in Abstract form. Endoluminal management of GERD includes using radiofrequency energy, injection of biocompatible polymers, and endoluminal sutures to alter the GEJ and reduce reflux. With currently earned and further growing experience, endoscopic treatment of GERD has future promise; however, more experience and perhaps further refinement in techniques and technology must occur before widespread clinical application can be encouraged.","1282":"The technique of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) was made available for clinical use in 1983. To our knowledge, this technique is currently the only one-port system in endoscopic surgery by which a direct endoluminal approach to the target organ by using a natural opening of the body. Use of the stereoscopic view also is unique in procedures performed routinely. The first indication for use of this new technique was excision of rectal adenomas. It provided the potential of low complications and low recurrence rates compared with the conventional surgical procedures. With the development of endorectal ultrasound for staging, and because many adenomatous polyps contained early rectal cancer, the question arose as to how to deal with these patients after successful local excision. Studies showed that the indication for use of the TEM-technique was extended to early, good differentiated rectal cancer-so-called, low-risk rectal cancer. Many studies showed that the TEM-technique is the optimal operation to avoid complications for patients with rectal polyps and low-risk pT1 tumours of the rectum. The main problem remains regarding how to identify these patients preoperatively and separate them from those who already have a high risk of local recurrence and lymph node metastasis at the time of operation. The effectiveness of any preoperative or postoperative combined treatment to reduce the risk of local recurrence and lymph node metastasis remains unclear. Combined treatment could be a future option to also cure more advanced cancer. Currently, the TEM-technique is the only endoscopic technique that uses a natural opening to reach the target organ, and is a valuable surgical technique with a low complication rate for patients with adenomatous rectal tumours and early rectal cancer.","1283":"Approximately 1 in 30 patients suffering from colorectal cancer (CRC) will develop peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) in the absence of systemic spread. The mechanisms giving rise to PC in CRC are incompletely understood, but involve a complex stepwise interaction between the malignant cell and mesothelial layer. Systemic palliative chemotherapy is usually offered, but of limited activity in PC. Cytoreductive surgery followed by intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion (HIPEC) has been described recently in management of isolated PC originating from CRC, based on a sound biological rationale of synergism and a pharmacokinetical advantage. Several retrospective series, one prospective randomized trial, and a meta analysis have clearly shown a survival benefit for patients treated with cytoreduction + HIPEC provided a complete (R0) resection is performed. Toxicity of the procedure is considerable, and mainly depends on the extent of surgery. Future trials are needed to provide more solid evidence in favor of surgery in PC originating from CRC in the era of modern chemotherapy and to better define the role of HIPEC as an adjunct to surgery.","1284":"Laparoscopic linear cutting staplers are commonly used in bariatric surgery. Although many staple sizes are available, the clinical results of a staple line vary depending on the staple size and tissue environment. To help surgeons choose the proper staple size as well as establish design parameters for the development of new stapling devices, understanding the mechanical properties of the tissue is necessary. Knowing the distribution of the thickness of the stomach tissue would allow for increased accuracy in defining key design parameters for stapling devices, thus improving their performance in the operating theater. To this end, 50 sleeve\/lateral gastrectomy specimens were obtained in a consecutive series from individuals undergoing weight loss surgery. Thickness measurements were performed at six predetermined sites. Results show that stomach thickness varies from thinnest at the proximal end near the esophageal junction to thickest near the pylorus. The data also suggest that the stomach is thinner along the greater curvature. Due to the variation in thickness of the stomach, laparoscopic linear cutting staplers with thicker staples are recommended when transecting the antrum. This thickness data will facilitate the development of devices with appropriate aperture closure for correct tissue compression.","1285":"Circular staplers are used to create the gastrojejunostomy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The anvil of the stapler can be placed within the pouch by way of the oropharynx or trans-abdominally, but these methods have limitations. The SurgASSIST Computer Mediated Stapler (Power Medical Interventions, New Hope, PA, USA) is a new technology that changes surgical stapling. The staplers are closed and fired under surgeon control by a computer for better accuracy and reliability. It has a 21-mm stapler, which can be passed orally for endoluminal stapling. The SurgASSIST has several advantages over the traditional circular stapled gastrojejunal anastomosis, including no need to dilate trocars to accommodate the stapler through the abdominal wall and decreased wound infections.","1286":"Laparoscopic gastrointestinal (GI) surgery often requires transection and reconstruction of the GI tract and division of vascular pedicles. Intraoperative staple line bleeding and postoperative GI hemorrhage are reported complications. Prevention of staple line bleeding includes oversewing of the staple line or more recently the use of staple line reinforcement sleeves as an adjunct on the stapler. The results of bioabsorbable glycolide copolymer sleeves (Seamguard, W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ, USA) as staple line reinforcement during 44 laparoscopic GI operations were reviewed. The charts were analyzed retrospectively for demographics, quantity of staple line reinforcement material used, operative time, blood loss, intraoperative complications, postoperative bleeding or leak, and serial hemoglobin. The study group of 44 patients included 17 males and 27 females, with a median age of 44 years. The laparoscopic GI operations performed were laparoscopic cystgastrostomy (n=1), esophagus cancer staging (n=2), esophagectomy (n=2), colectomy (n=3), gastrectomy (n=5), appendectomy (n=9), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n=22). The median number of staple line reinforcement sleeves used per operation was one for appendectomy and laparoscopic cancer staging, five for gastrectomy and esophagectomy, and seven for gastric bypass and colectomy. The mean blood loss was 86 +\/- 22 mL. No intraoperative staple line disruptions occurred. Intraoperative staple line bleeding was minimal and few staple lines required oversewing. One patient developed GI hemorrhage on postoperative day five after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. The mean hemoglobin decreased from 13.9 +\/- 1.6 g\/dL at baseline to 12.6 +\/-1.4 g\/dL on the first postoperative day. No postoperative leaks or abscesses occurred. This study demonstrates that bioabsorbable glycolide copolymer staple line sleeves is safe and effective in prevention of intraoperative staple line bleeding and postoperative GI hemorrhage in 44 intra-abdominal GI operations.","1287":"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease that usually responds positively to treatment with thymectomy. Standard surgical procedures have been shown to result in a beneficial outcome. This Chapter includes discussions regarding what are controversial, and opinions as to what constitutes the optimal access to be used for thymectomy. In a prospective study conducted between 8\/97 and 12\/03, 137 patients with MG underwent thoracoscopic thymectomy, for which a left-sided approach was generally applied. An analysis of the intraoperative and postoperative course was performed, as well as of the impact of the surgical procedure on further development of the disease. The results obtained were compared with those published in the literature, with particular reference to results obtained with open surgery. The patients in this study were 96 females and 41 males, with a mean age of 35.8 (range: 9-83) years. The mean preoperative duration of the disease was 22.9 (range: 1-140) months. In 8 (5.8%) patients, the procedure was converted to an anterolateral thoracotomy or sternotomy. The postoperative morbidity rate was 5.8%, one (0.7) patient died and the mean follow up was 24.7 (range: 1-57) months. Complete remission was noted in 19.4%, and improvements reflected either in a reduction in the medication required or a decrease in symptom severity, in a total of 76.8%. Complete thoracoscopic thymectomy is a technically feasible operation, equally as effective as conventional open surgery. Remissions or symptomatic improvements were observed in more than 70% of the patients. The low morbidity rate, coupled with excellent cosmetic results, have led to increasing acceptance of the operation both by patients and Neurologists. Therefore, thoracoscopic thymectomy represents a new, alternative method for use in patients with MG.","1288":"The Anastoclip Vessel Closure System (VCS) (LeMaitre Vascular, Burlington, MA, USA), introduced primarily to facilitate microvascular anastomoses performed during neurosurgical extra-intracranial bypasses, has been used for several other applications as well. The relatively new anastomotic technique includes a clip applier, clip remover, and everting forceps. With the applier, tiny nonpenetrating titanium clips were installed on everted walls of tubular structures. The technical ease of application, reduced anastomotic time, superior hemodynamics, and an improved healing pattern at the anastomosis have been recognized as major advantages compared to conventional suturing. This chapter describes the various indications for use of the system and categorizes them by specific surgical specialties, which include neurosurgery, urology, and gynecology, as well as plastic and reconstructive, vascular, thoracic, transplantation, hepatopancreaticobiliary, and orthopedic and trauma surgery. The largest clinical experience with clips is in vascular access surgery for hemodialysis purposes, both in autologous constructs and with prosthetic grafts. Promising clinical results also have been achieved in neurosurgical cases (both for microvascular anastomoses and with closure of dura mater), microvascular free-tissue transfer, and renal and liver transplantations. Future clinical applications include the use of clips for nerve repair and closure of various types of tubular structures using a laparoscopic approach.","1289":"Intraoperative Tumor site recognition is extremely difficult during laparoscopic surgical treatment of early-stage gastrointestinal carcinoma. A novel marking method that uses both metallic clips and a marking clip detector system (MCDS, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) modified from a metal detector system, was designed by the authors. Metallic clips were applied to the tumor site during preoperative endoscopy, and the clip site was identified intraoperatively using the MCDS. In a basic ex vivo study, three metallic clips were detected easily (100% detection). In a clinical study, the marking site was detected in all gastric cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy. The mean distance between detected site and clip along the longitudinal bowel axis was 6.4 +\/- 2.9 mm. Mean detection time was 18.1 +\/- 5.7 seconds. None of the patients in this study experienced complications from this marking technique. MCDS allows accurate identification of tumor sites. This method may be useful for tumor-site identification during laparoscopic gastrectomy.","1290":"Acceptance is increasing for pharmacological prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) for most types of surgery, but its use remains controversial in neurosurgical patients because of the threat of catastrophic hemorrhage. Consequently, mechanical measures such as sequential calf compression and graduated compression stockings are currently the preferred prophylaxis for neurosurgical patients. However, some patients remain at high risk despite these measures and may require prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins or unfractionated heparin. In neurosurgical patients, known risk factors for DVT or PE include advanced age, malignancy, limb weakness, prolonged surgery, and cranial as opposed to spinal surgery. Using comprehensive neurosurgery databases, the authors identify more specific neurosurgical diagnoses and procedures as risk factors for DVT and PE, and show increases in the frequency of DVT and PE for the wider neurosurgery population and for glioma patients over time. DVT prophylaxis is compared in public and private hospital settings. This chapter contributes to the changing picture of DVT and PE in neurosurgical patients over the last two decades.","1291":"A literature review between 2000 and 2005 has been conducted for laparoscopic access techniques. The blind insertion of a Veress needle or first trocar to create the pneumoperitoneum has been shown to cause vascular and visceral injuries. To reduce the risk of peritoneal entry, many surgeons prefer an open-access technique, like a Hasson trocar. Other trocars that can be used for laparoscopic entry are direct trocars and radially expanding trocars. No specific technique has been shown to be superior in preventing vascular and visceral complications. Optical trocars combine the advantages of the different entry techniques. This chapter describes the different entry techniques, indications, and clinical experiences of the optical trocars. An optical trocar provides a safe and feasible primary insertion method for laparoscopy in patients prone to access injuries.","1292":"It is well-established that laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric bypass is a technically challenging operation that requires a long learning curve. With the demand for bariatric surgery, particularly laparoscopic bariatric surgery on the rise, the focus has changed to ensure those performing this difficult procedure are trained appropriately. The ideal training would emphasize two things: (1) acquisition of advanced laparoscopic skills and intraoperative techniques, and (2) knowledge of preoperative and postoperative care of the bariatric patient. The current models for training for laparoscopic bariatric surgery fall into several categories: no training, formal courses, mini-fellowships, and formal minimally invasive surgery\/bariatric fellowships. Each of these training paradigms is examined, as well as the available data that compare their effectiveness.","1293":"Although mammography remains the most widely used tool for the early detection of breast cancers and evaluation of palpable abnormalities, a number of other imaging tools are being developed and used. Ultrasonography (US) is an excellent adjunct to conventional mammography. In addition to identifying solid and cystic abnormalities, US can often distinguish benign and malignant solid nodules. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also is useful in assessing the extent of disease within the breast, particularly in women with dense breasts. MRI may be a more sensitive screening tool in women at elevated breast cancer risk. Newer techniques based on the metabolic activity of breast tumors also have been developed. One such technique is scintimammography, which uses radiolabeled tracers to detect breast malignancies. Positron emission tomography (PET), which relies on the high metabolic rate of tumors, also has been described as a method to evaluate breast disease. Other techniques, such as optical tomography and thermography, rely on angiogenesis and generated heat to identify cancers. These and other tools may help to improve both the sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection. Ideally, this improved detection results in improved outcomes in those who have breast cancer and avoidance of unnecessary procedures in those who do not.","1294":"An Hypothermia is defined as a decrease in core temperature below 35 degrees C. The well-described deleterious effects of accidental hypothermia on outcome in multiple-trauma patients contrast the beneficial effect of controlled hypothermia on organ function during ischemia in elective surgery. Experimental studies have shown that induced hypothermia during hemorrhagic shock might have beneficial effects on outcome. The beneficial effects of induced hypothermia appear to be partly mediated by the prolongation of the \"golden hour\" with prevention of hypoxic organ dysfunction. However, hypothermia also has been thought to have an impact on the immunologic response after trauma and elective surgery. Induction of hypothermia seems to decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines believed to influence distant organ damage positively, and is mediated by the interaction of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) and capillary endothelial cells. Nevertheless, the incidence of posttraumatic infectious complications may be increased after induction of hypothermia due to an overexpression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Together with this immunosuppressive profile, coagulopathy and bleeding might limit the use of induced hypothermia after multiple trauma and elective surgery. The purpose of this Chapter is to highlight current knowledge regarding the interaction of hypothermia and posttraumatic immune reactivity. A better understanding of these mechanisms would assist the introduction of preventive and therapeutic strategies into clinical practice.","1295":"Adequate haemostasis is an important part of any surgical procedure, but particularly so in the case of visceral organ surgery where apparently insignificant ooze can ultimately result in significant haemorrhage and coagulopathy. To achieve haemorrhage control, the surgeon may use conventional techniques (eg, suture ligation, diathermy, and swab compression), but failing this has the option of using physical coagulation tools (eg, the argon beam coagulator) and haemostasis adjuncts (eg, fibrin glues and collagen sheets). Advances in manufacturing have led to development of several other haemostatic products including absorbable gelatin sponges, cyanoacrylates, and polymer-based adhesives. One such product consists of a fixed, ready-to-use equine collagen sponge coated with human thrombin and fibrinogen. It may be applied directly to the bleeding surface, without the need for preparation or reconstitution. This chapter reviews the published evidence and compares its use to other classes of haemostasis adjuncts across a range of surgical specialties, namely hepatic, splenic, thoracic, vascular, and minimally invasive surgery. It also aims to highlight the apparent advantages and limitations of the fibrinogen and thrombin-coated collagen sponge compared to other commercially available haemostasis adjuncts, and identify potential applications for the product.","1296":"Although peritonitis has been recognized as a common and complex disease entity since ancient times, the true understanding and pathophysiology, as well as treatment of peritonitis, continue to plague surgeons and physicians. The clinical course and outcome of peritonitis is dependent upon the struggle between the quantity and virulence of the pathogen and host's physiologic reserve, including the ensuing inflammatory response. The current multimodality treatment of intraabdominal infections is based upon the fundamental principles established by Polk in 1979: surgical source control, fluid resuscitation, adequate nutrition, support of failing organ systems, and antibiotics. Although dramatic advances have been made in the pharmacological treatment of intraabdominal infections, mortality for complicated cases remains high. Consequently, future directions in management of peritonitis may require agents that target specific endotoxin receptors, inflammatory signaling molecules, or immunomodulatory moieties.","1297":"Operating-room design has not changed significantly since the modern era of surgery began. Minimal invasive, endoscopic, procedures, and evolution of technology will affect operating-room design in the near future. Poor ergonomics has always been one of the major drawbacks of endoscopic surgery. Use of retractable arms and monitors will improve ergonomics of the operating team. Developments in telecommunication will allow surgeons to communicate with colleagues and experts during the procedure in virtually any location around the world, which increases teaching possibilities and procedural safety. Introduction and further development of intraoperative imaging, including real-time, three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of patient, and computer-aided surgery offer surgeons the opportunity to train the planned surgical procedure. Moreover, they will improve control and supervision of the procedure in learning situations. The last decade's robotics have made their introduction into the operating rooms. They improve control over the operating-room environment and will facilitate the performance of more complex procedures. However, high costs and lack of force feedback remain its major drawbacks. Improvements of robotic techniques and its implementation into the operating rooms will further guide their design into highly specialized operating units.","1298":"The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is currently the most common procedure performed for treatment of morbid obesity in the United States. The technique reported in this chapter requires mastering of extra-corporeal and intra-corporeal laparoscopic suturing, but is safe, cost effective, and technically feasible. Use of the straight needle eliminates the challenge of proper needle orientation encountered with a curved needle. The linear technique is used to construct the gastrojejunostomy because it is time saving and relatively simple. An endoscopic ruler and bougie are used to ensure a consistent pouch size and alimentary limb length. This chaper demonstrates the use of preoperative preparation, and a meticulous surgical technique using the linear stapler, to perform a combined total of more than 1800 cases.","1299":"The objective of this chapter was to demonstrate evolving transforaminal endoscopic microdecompression for herniated lumbar discs and spinal stenosis, and to become accomplished with endoscopic micro spinal instruments and laser application. Since 1993, 2000 patients with 3421 herniated lumbar discs were diagnosed with symptomatic lumbar single and multiple herniated intervertebral discs. Progressive series of different diameters endoscopic-assisted tubular retractors, with appropriate-sized dilators and more aggressive saw-toothed trephines, and laser were used to perform transforaminal endoscopic micro-decompression, in addition to the posterior-lateral foraminoscope and endoscopic-assisted spinal operating systems. No postoperative mortalities occurred, and the morbidity rate was less than 1%, in the 2000 patients. For a single level, 94% of the patients had good or excellent results; 6% had some residual symptoms although improved overall. Transforaminal endoscopic laser microdecompression can effectively decompress herniated lumbar discs and spinal stenosis, when foraminoplasty is performed, which provides a safe and effective modality to achieve results in effective spinal decompression, preserves spinal motion, and creates a channel for spinal arthroplasty.","1300":"Permanent palsies of the median nerve cause severe impairment of hand functions. This chapter reviews both the various surgical methods able to restore functions and complex mechanisms necessary for brain adaptation to the new functions of the cortical areas. Different methods of reconstructive surgery, according to both the severity of palsy and patients' needs, are presented. The contemporary restoration of sensory function of the paralysed digits is recommended, as sensation is a prerequisite for good motor function. The various mechanisms and methods useful to obtain good gliding and strength of the transferred tendons are stressed. Reconstructive surgery for permanent palsy of the median nerve can supply improved function, provided that all the recommendations for a meticulous balance of the number of functions to be restored and available motors to be transferred, as well as of their strength and course, are addressed.","1301":"Fondaparinux (Arixtra, GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, PA.) is the first synthetic selective factor Xa inhibitor. A worldwide phase III program, that consists of four randomized, double-blind trials, in patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture, and elective hip replacement and elective major knee surgery was conducted to compare the benefit-to-risk ratio of a subcutaneous 2.5 mg once-daily regimen of fondaparinux starting postoperatively versus enoxaparin in preventing venous thromboembolism. The overall incidence of venous thromboembolism up to day 11 was reduced from 13.7% in the enoxaparin group, to 6.8% in the fondaparinux group, with a relative risk reduction of 50.6% in favor of fondaparinux (95% confidence interval: 40.9% to 59.1%, p&lt;0.001). The overall incidence of clinically relevant bleeding was low and did not differ between the two groups. The benefit of fondaparinux was consistent across all types of surgery and all subgroups. The further randomized, double-blind PENTHIFRA-PLUS trial showed that extending fondaparinux prophylaxis from one to four weeks after hip fracture surgery was well tolerated and, compared to one-week fondaparinux, dramatically reduced delayed venous thromboembolism events from 35.0% to 1.4% (p&lt;0.001). Four-week fondaparinux could become the standard thromboprophylaxis after hip fracture surgery. Fondaparinux is the first selective factor Xa inhibitor approved for use in thromboprophylaxis after orthopedic surgery.","1302":"Survivorship analysis has demonstrated the excellent long-term clinical success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Despite multiple attempts to enhance fixation with cementless technology, cemented TKA continues to be the \"gold standard.\" The rate of loosening has diminished as the accuracy of implantation has been improved through sophisticated instrumentation and enhanced experience. Current technology with respect to computer-assisted surgery serves only to improve the accuracy of implantation, leaving materials as the weakest link in the long-term survivorship of TKA. Failure secondary to polyethylene wear has ranked as one of the most frequent causes for revision. Many issues have been identified as contributory to polyethylene wear and include the quality of the polyethylene, manufacturing process, nature of the tibial-femoral or patellofemoral articulation, area of contact, sterilization process, and issues pertaining to modularity and so-called backside wear. Long-term clinical studies have documented the success of direct compression-molded monoblock tibial components. However, the benefits of modularity are widely recognized and include the ability to fine tune soft-tissue balance after implantation of metallic devices. In an effort to combine the long-term success of direct compression molded monoblock tibial components with the occasional need for modularity, a convertible tibial component has been introduced. This device is manufactured as a direct compression-molded monoblock tibial component. The surgeon has the ability at the time of the surgical intervention, or any subsequent intervention, to convert the tibial component into a modular device. Therefore, this device addresses, in the majority of cases, the concerns that arise from backside wear.","1303":"Between 5% to 10% of tibial fractures progress to nonunion, causing substantial disability. Bone autografts, along with internal fixation, are the usual treatment for these failures, but the morbidity associated with autogenous tissues remains problematic. Bone morphogenetic proteins are currently available for clinical use and preclinical models, as well as an increasing number of patients treated with these molecules demonstrate their safety and efficacy. Osteogenic Protein-1, OP-1, has been evaluated in a randomized, prospective, multi-institution study of tibial nonunions. Sixty-one patients with 63 nonunions received OP-1 and intramedullary rod fixation, and were compared with 61 patients with 61 nonunions treated with fresh autogenous bone graft and the same fixation. Clinical outcomes (success in 81% of OP-1 and 85% of autograft-treated patients) and radiographic evaluation (healing in 75% of OP-1 and 84% of autograft-treated patients) were statistically indistinguishable at 9 months following treatment. No OP-1 or graft-related adverse events occurred. More than 20% of the autograft group had significant donor-site pain 6 months following surgery. OP-1 is a safe and effective alternative to autogenous bone in treatment of tibial nonunions.","1304":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are among the most successful procedures performed in terms of quality-of-life years gained. The long-term goals of arthroplasty, to relieve pain, increase function, provide stability, and obtain durability, are accomplished in the vast majority of cases. The short-term goals, however, have become the target of aggressive peri-operative programs that aim to speed recovery, reduce morbidity and complications, and create a program of efficiency while maintaining the highest level of patient care. The concept of rapid recovery is built upon the burgeoning interest in less-invasive and small-incision surgeries for (THA and TKA). However, the incision size does not appear to be the most critical aspect of the program. This article outlines the specific elements of the rapid-recovery program for lower-extremity arthroplasty patients, including pre-operative patient education, peri-operative nutrition, vitamin and herbal medication supplementation, preemptive analgesia, and post-operative rehabilitation. A holistic peri-operative, rapid-recovery program has lead to a significantly decreased hospital length of stay and significantly lower hospital readmission rates in patients who undergo primary THAs and TKAs. Combining these results with minimally invasive techniques and instrumentation should make recovery even faster.","1305":"This study was performed to determine whether differences existed between primary knee replacement performed through a standard medial parapatellar approach, and those performed through a minimally invasive mini-mid vastus approach. It was a prospective study compared with a retrospective evaluation of a matched cohort. In this study, the Genesis(tm) II and its MIS instrumentation were used. Patients with the mini-mid vastus MIS incision (MMV MIS) required less pain medication post-operatively, regained their flexion more rapidly, and attained their functional milestones at an earlier point than those with the traditional median parapatellar long incision. Despite the smaller incision, component placement was radiographically excellent in all cases. Optimal performance of the surgery required the use of special instrumentation, modified so as to be used in smaller incisions.","1306":"Minimally invasive repair of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is rapidly becoming a vital tool in the arsenal of the vascular specialist. Historically, surgical replacement of the aorta has been the \"gold standard\" for treatment of aortic aneurysms. However, transfemoral placement of an endovascular stent graft, first described by Dr. Parodi and colleagues in 1991, marked the beginning of a new era in treatment of aortic aneurysms. This approach has evolved, allowing success with significantly less morbidity. Over time, if the long-term results continue to prove favorable, endovascular stent graft repair of aortic aneurysms may become the most effective means to treat this life-threatening disease.","1307":"This study examines the role of sex and race in the diagnosis and outcome of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A retrospective study was performed of 632 patients who underwent venous duplex ultrasound from August 1998 to July 1999. Comparisons were made by Chi-square analysis. Seventy-four percent of the patients were women and 79% of the total group was African American. Twenty-two percent (140) of the examinations were positive for DVT. Of all studies performed in men, 37% were positive for DVT, and of all studies performed in women, 18% were positive for DVT (P&lt;0.05). Additionally, African-American women were more likely to be positive for DVT than Caucasian women. One-year follow up showed that 42% had residual thrombus and, regardless of sex, African-Americans were more likely to have persistent thrombus than Caucasians (60% vs. 19%). Findings in this study suggest, in our cohort, African American women were diagnosed with DVT twice as often as Caucasian women and African Americans were more likely to have a persistent DVT as compared to Caucasians.","1308":"Recent trends in computed tomography (CT) scanner technology has opened new frontiers in the field of non-invasive coronary angiography. Given the relatively important number of negative invasive angiographies performed each year, eliminating the risks inherent to this procedure by non-invasive methods greatly contribute to diminishing the risk. After injection of contrast, the procedure is performed under short apnea and triggered by electrocardiographic (ECG) recording that provides a multitude of possible image reconstructions; ie, volume rendering, virtual angioscopy, and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the heart and coronary vessels. In 100 patients, adequate visualisation of the coronary arteries was achieved in 98%, with the advantage of visualizing the coronary wall as well as the lumen. The main reasons for failure were arrhythmia and excessive motion. Besides evaluating coronary artery atherosclerosis, computed tomography angiography (CTA) allowed the diagnosis of coronary aneurysm and exact localization of postoperative false aneurysm. The main disadvantages of the technique are the absence of dynamic films and exposure to radiation. The increased accuracy and sensitivity of noninvasive coronary angiography make it an excellent diagnostic tool and a probable replacement to invasive procedures. It should reduce the morbidity and mortality as well as the cost of conventional coronary arteriography. Furthermore, it has the added benefit of offering spacial resolution of the examined vessels.","1309":"Ministernotomy (MS) is a well-known procedure developed in the past ten years along with the rise of minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Upper, mid, or inferior partial sternotomies allow coronary surgery, as well as aortic and mitral valve approaches. Contrary to anterior thoracotomy, access to the great vessels is sometimes easy, which renders central cannulation possible. In opposition to total sternotomy (TS), MS could procure better postoperative stability that would aide in reduction of wound infections. Nevertheless, upper MS can be responsible for the lesion of the internal thoracic arteries (ITAs). Moreover, little evidence exists regarding blood sparing in MS approaches. MS presents the problem of hiding a part of the cardiac structures. For example, in the case of aortic surgery by way of upper sternotomy for example, left venting is risky or even impossible. However, partial inferior sternotomy can be interesting for aortic valve surgery in patients with in situ right ITA passing in front of the aorta, protecting the grafts during dissection. In coronary surgery, inferior T sternotomy and C sternotomy allow perfect access to the coronary network. Some authors also have described inferior \"T\" sternotomy for various congenital lesions. If mini-invasive cardiac surgery can offer reduced postoperative morbidity and faster rehabilitation, the advantages of MS upon TS--except for cosmetic aspects--remain to be defined. Thus, this approach should be reserved for selected patients and lesions.","1310":"For living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), accurate diagnostic evaluation is essential. Problems arise in assessment of the vascular, bile duct anatomy, liver graft volume, and vascular territories involved. Requirements for the realization of decision-support and enhanced precision in the planning of surgery in LDLT engineering fields are a three-dimensional (3D) visualization system that improves anatomic assessment, allows for interactive surgery planning, and acts as an intraoperative guide. Thirteen LDLT candidates and three LDLT recipients were assessed by \"multislice\" computer-tomographic examinations. Image processing for 3D visualization included segmentation and calculation of centre lines. A hierarchical mathematical model representing the vascular and biliary tree was created, which allowed calculation of individual vascular territories. Precision of 3D computed tomography (CT)-based visualizations was superior to diagnostic modalities used currently. In addition to detection of decisive anatomic variants, computerized interactive insertion of splitting lines allowed for better planning of the surgical approach and image-guided surgery. 3D CT-based visualization in LDLT facilitates diagnostic evaluation with high accuracy. Multiple examinations, especially with regard to invasive diagnostics, may be avoided. Surgical strategy was directly influenced by the detection of vascular and biliary variants.","1311":"Currently, orthotopic liver transplantation (LT) represents the treatment of choice for most end-stage liver diseases. Advances in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive therapy have markedly increased its success. However, the main obstacle in LT remains the lack of donor organs with a current mortality rate for patients on the waiting list of up to 20%. This chapter focuses on developments in SLT techniques and living-donor LT to alleviate this problem. SLT yields a net gain of organs, in that it uses one organ to save either an adult and a child, or two adults. The initially used technique of ex-situ splitting is being replaced progressively by the in-situ splitting technique, which yields better preserved grafts. The latest step has been the introduction of living-donor segmental LT. The systematic combination of both techniques may lead to a further reduction of mortality for patients on the waiting list for LT.","1312":"T his innovative sling system places the sling between the obturator foramens using a perineal approach while preserving an intact retropubic space. Potential complications associated with tension-free sling systems that use needle-carrier placement through the retropubic space, such as the tension-free vaginal tape (TVT, Gynecare, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA), are eliminated and routine cystoscopy is not required. The procedure is effective and safe for the primary treatment of stress urinary incontinence in patients with urethral hypermobility, intrinsic sphincter deficiency, or both. It is equally efficient in treatment of recurrent and mixed urinary incontinence. Short-term results are similar to those of the retropubic tension-free slings.","1313":"An increasing number of adnexal masses are currently managed laparoscopically, which has hampered progress regarding the different techniques of laparoscopic surgery. In this chapter, a modified application of surgical instrument was described in laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy-we named this device, Lap-Disc Mini. This new instrument has three rings, an inner flexible ring fixed to a middle ring by a rubber corset, and an additional dynamic outer ring that has a rubbery-like iris opening, which allows the application of different-sized trocars and extracorporeal ovarian cystectomy. This technique has proved to be effective and safe, especially in removing large ovarian cyst.","1314":"T he authors' technique of minilaparotomy hysterotomy is a new modality that combines the technical benefits of conventional laparotomy with the minimally invasive convalescent and cosmetic advantages of laparoscopic surgery. For patients in whom vaginal hysterectomy is considered contraindicated, this procedure offers an effective and safe minimal access alternative. This redesigned minilaparotomy approach relies on traditional open techniques and experience instrumentation that avoid the cost of expensive equipment, long learning curve, and prolonged operating time associated with laparoscopic surgery, as well as the convalescent disadvantages of a standard laparotomy.","1315":"In this study, laparoscopic hysterectomy was done with a special lift system that elevates the abdominal wall without carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation. During this procedure, bipolar diathermy scissors also were used, which disconnected the uterus from its vessels and ligaments. The uterus was then removed through the vagina. In 403 cases, variables including operation time, complication rate, blood loss, postoperative pain, hospital stay, vaginal discharge, and convalescence time were examined. Compared with other laparoscopic methods [laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH), supracervical hysterectomy, and total laparoscopic hysterectomy], all those examined showed better results. Further advantages of the gasless Lift-laparoscopic total hysterectomy are lower costs and an effective \"learning curve.\" Use of this method routinely could decrease the number of conventional-surgical hysterectomies that result in additional complications.","1316":"In the mid-1990s, the authors introduced a minimally invasive system of cesarean delivery. This article illustrates the improvements made since the technique's initial publication. The Pelosi Minimalist Cesarean procedure is the simplest and least traumatic approach of cesarean delivery. The procedure described herein features a short operating time, minimal instrumentation, reduced surgical dissection, decreased postoperative pain, and reduced risk of blood loss, infection, and wound complications. It is easily learned and cost-effective, with a brief postoperative recovery period.","1317":"Endometriosis is best treated by surgical excision. This can be accomplished either by excision of the endometriosis with reproductive tract preservation or by excision of endometriosis with hysterectomy. This latter approach eliminates endometriosis in the muscle of the uterus (where it is called adenomyosis) and is especially effective for pelvic pain. Ovarian preservation can be considered using hysterectomy if the surgeon excises most of the endometriosis. Techniques to excise endometriosis, including rectosigmoid disease, and perform hysterectomy are detailed in this chapter.","1318":"Transcervical hysteroscopic permanent sterilization is currently Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved. The hysteroscopic approach obviates the need for general anesthesia and surgical incision. The device is a dynamically expanding micro-insert that, when placed in the proximal portion of the fallopian tube, generates a benign tissue response that results in anchoring of the device and subsequent occlusion of the tube. The current trial of 745 women seeking birth control from Australia, Europe, and the United States were evaluated for successful micro-insert placement at three months. Comfort, safety, and return to normal activity were evaluated. All patients were followed for five years and returned for annual gynecologic status. Procedure time was 18 minutes, 92% returned to work in one day. There were no reported pregnancies among these patients in 27,526 months. The transcervical approach for sterilization represents ease of application, low morbidity, and convenience to the patient.","1319":"The SECCA (Curon Medical, Freemont, CA USA) device delivers temperature-controlled radiofrequency (RF) energy to the anorectal junction to treat fecal incontinence. The procedure is performed as an outpatient either in the endoscopy suite or ambulatory surgery center. After appropriate local block, the SECCA device is then inserted into the anal canal and submucosal RF energy is delivered circumferentially to the anorectal junction. A pilot trial in Mexico on 10 patients demonstrated a significant improvement in Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Scores (CCF-FIS) from a pre-treatment score of 13.5 to 12-month post-treatment score of 3.8. These patients continued to have significantly improved continence with an average CCF-FIS of 7.3 at 24-month follow up. A multi-center, institutional review board-approved, open label, prospective trial that evaluates the efficacy and safety of the SECCA procedure has been completed in the United States (U.S.). Five centers prospectively enrolled 50 patients with greater than or equal to 3 months of weekly fecal incontinence who also had failed either medical or surgical interventions. Patients underwent anoscopy, anorectal manometry (ARM), endoanal ultrasound (EAUS), and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) at 0 and 6 months. The CCF-FIS scale, fecal incontinence-related quality of life score (FIQL), and SF-36 were administered at 0, 3, and 6 months. After conscious sedation and local perianal block, RF energy was delivered by way of the SECCA device. At 6 months, the mean CCF-FI score improved significantly (14.5 to 11.1, p&lt;0.0001). All FIQL parameters improved: lifestyle (2.5 to 3.1, p=0.0001), coping (1.9 to 2.3, p=0.005), depression (2.8 to 3.1, p=0.0008), embarrassment (1.9 to 2.5, p&lt;0.0001). Sixty-percent (n=30) of the patients improved after therapy, with 70% resolution of their symptoms. The SF-36 mental composite score (45.3 to 48.3, p=0.06) and social function sub-score (64.0 to 77.3, p=0.003) improved. No changes occurred in ARM, EAUS, or PNTML. Two major complications included two mucosal ulcerations. From these data, the authors concluded that RF energy delivered for treatment of FI safely improves CCF-FIS, FIQL, and quality of life.","1320":"Use of laparoscopic resection for colorectal malignancy has raised concerns regarding local cancer control and the lack of long-term results. Most reported data are preliminary and medium-term results, at best. The aim of this study is to analyse all patients who underwent a laparoscopic resection for colorectal cancer at our department between November 1992 and July 2003. The cohort comprised a total of 394 patients (194 rectal cancer and 200 colon carcinoma). The most common procedures were high and low anterior resection with total mesorectum excision (TME) (176), followed by sigmoidectomy (89), right hemicolectomy (57), and left hemicolectomy (42). Mean operating time was 176 minutes. Conversion was necessary in 4 of the patients. Mean number of lymph nodes removed was 27. The postoperative complication rate was 20.1% (rectum) and 12.5% (colon). One patient died of myocardial infarction. Mean follow up was 45 (0.3-135) months. Port site metastasis occurred in 2 patients. The local recurrence rate was 4.1% after curative rectum resection and 0.5% in the colon group. After curative resection, the overall 5-year survival rate was 76.9% (rectum), and 81.4% (colon). Cancer-related survival rate after 5 years was 87.7% (rectum), and 91.3% (colon). Our results demonstrate that laparoscopic resection for colorectal cancer is not associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. Established oncological principles are respected and long-term results are at least as good as those after open surgery.","1321":"The prevalence of obesity in the United States (U.S.) is increasing to epidemic proportions. Currently, more than 60% of Americans and 51% of Germans are overweight. Whereas a variety of medications are available for treatment of obesity, none results in the long-term loss of more than 10% of body weight. The current standard for treatment of severe obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 35 kg\/m2 with comorbidities and generally greater than 40 kg\/m2, is surgical. Several surgical procedures are currently available, including gastric bypass, biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) with duodenal switch, and the adjustable gastric band. These operations may be performed using laparoscopic surgical techniques to minimize perioperative morbidity and postoperative recovery time. To optimize the outcome of this type of procedure, bariatric surgery should be performed on carefully selected patients, in bariatric centers specially equipped to care for the obese, within a broadly based, multidisciplinary setting that provides lifelong postoperative care.","1322":"The role of liver resection for benign and malignant hepatobiliary diseases is expanding because of the markedly reduced operative mortality in recent years, as the result of better patient selection, improved surgical techniques, and better perioperative management. The major technical challenge of liver resection is control of bleeding during transection of liver parenchyma. Ultrasonic dissector and clamp crushing are the two techniques used most frequently in liver transection. In recent years, new instruments have been developed for liver transection with an aim to reduce bleeding. Other important advances in liver surgery that have contributed to improved perioperative outcomes include intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS), use of vascular staplers, and reduced bleeding by the development of low central venous pressure anesthesia. Laparoscopy is useful for staging purposes, and laparoscopic liver resection is gaining popularity due to the availability of new laparoscopic instruments for liver transection. Development of local ablative therapies for liver tumors, such as radiofrequency (RF) ablation, is posing a competition to liver resection. However, such techniques also have allowed expansion of indication for hepatic resection to patients with bilobar tumors, and thermal ablative technologies have been used for liver transection. This chapter reviews the current techniques of liver resection.","1323":"F ollowing tissue disruption, whether operative or traumatic, the priorities of any organism are cessation of hemorrhage, prevention of infection, and restoration of tissue integrity and function. Several hemostatic techniques achieve the goal of hemorrhage cessation. One evolving technique is the use of fibrin sealants (FSs) as a surgical tissue adhesive. The different and most common applications of fibrin glue in open and laparoscopic surgery are reviewed.","1324":"Many techniques have been analysed to reduce the risk of perioperative anastomotic leakage and bleeding. No specific resection technique with either linear or circular stapling devices has been shown to be superior in preventing these complications. Reinforcement of staple lines with various buttressing materials is a new strategy used to diminish or eliminate anastomotic leaks and haemorrhage. In this chapter, varying reinforcement techniques with different materials are compared. The available literature has been reviewed thoroughly for relevant data regarding stapled reinforcement techniques and minimizing anastomotic leaks and haemorrhage. Reported data show non-absorbable, semi-absorbable, and bioabsorbablematerials available for gastrointestinal (GI) resections. Semi-absorbable xenomaterials (Bovine Pericardial Strips and Bovine Collagen Strips; Shellhigh No-Reaction Vascupatch, Milburn, NJ, USA), non-absorbable expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE; W.L. Gore, Elkton, MD, USA) and absorbable poly (L-lactic acid-co-epsilon-caprolactomne) film are compared. Non-absorbable and semi-absorbable materials show many differences. Absorbable polymer membranes demonstrate marked benefits. Staple-line reinforcement used for laparoscopic GI surgery is a relatively new strategy, most probably improving perioperative outcome only if proper buttressing material is used. To decrease anastomotic complications, using an absorbable polymer membrane as staple-line reinforcement material is reliable and efficacious.","1325":"Bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy can successfully seal vascular structures up to 7 mm by fusing collagen and elastin in the lumen. Valleylab has created a system to expand this technology beyond vessel sealing with the development of a closed-loop, feedback-control RF generator that closely monitors tissue fusion. This generator, operating with a loop time of approximately 250 micros, continuously adjusts energy output, creating optimized soft-tissue fusion through structural protein amalgamation. In the first study, RF energy was applied to canine lung using the new-generation generator and lung-prototype device. A lobectomy was completed, sealing the lobar bronchus, parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature. Chronic performance of the seals was evaluated at necropsy on postoperative days 7 and 14. In a second study, RF energy was applied to porcine small intestine using the same closed-loop generator and anastomosis prototype device. Acute tissue fusion was assessed qualitatively for hemostasis and seal quality. Terminal tissue evaluation was completed on postoperative day 7 and analyzed histopathologically. Histopathology confirmed acute and chronic tissue fusion in both the lung and intestine. Normal pathological healing was substantiated by angiogenesis, granulation, and proliferation of fibroblasts. Preliminary studies using canine lung and porcine small intestine demonstrate the potential of this closed-loop generator for soft-tissue amalgamation. Advanced monitoring capabilities make this fusion system applicable in many soft-tissue structures with adequate collagen and elastin. Further investigation of potential surgical applications needs to be completed.","1326":"Of the 40 million patients who undergo surgery each year in the United States, 20% may develop a postoperative nosocomial infection. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common organism involved, and carriage of S. aureus in the anterior nares has been identified as a risk factor for these infections. Topical mupirocin applied to the anterior nares has been successful in eliminating S. aureus and decreasing nosocomial infections due to S. aureus. Concurrent use of preoperative chlorhexidine showers may further reduce the incidence of S. aureus surgical site infections (SSIs). In addition to treating the patient, active surveillance programs to eliminate nasal colonization in hospital surgical personnel have controlled outbreaks of S. aureus SSIs. Recently, a large study identified risk factors linked to S. aureus nasal colonization, which included obesity, male gender, and a history of a cerebrovascular accident. Protective factors included older age, current smoking, and alcohol use. Thus, by modulating these variables, investigators may create interventions aimed at reducing S. aureus nasal carriage and ultimately, postoperative nosocomial infections.","1327":"Great strides in the understanding of regulation of the immune system have led to development of strategies to harness the potential of cellular immune responses for improving the outcome for cancer patients. To generate a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to cancer cells requires tumor-specific antigens processed appropriately and displayed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, T-lymphocytes with receptors of appropriate specificity, and co-stimulation delivered by antigen-presenting cells through members of the B7 family. In this review, the fundamental advances that have been made in tumor antigen discovery, and the novel vaccine approaches arising from these advances are discussed.","1328":"Technology has transformed the face of surgical technique among the disciplines of surgery. This revolution has created a strong demand from the public for the availability of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) interventions. Significant pressure has been placed on both industry and medicine to develop, test, and implement devices and procedures at a rapid pace. Unfortunately, this pace has at times surpassed the system's ability to train and prepare a corps of surgeons competent in both the technical and cognitive aspects of minimal access surgery. The economic constraints of surgical practice, coupled with recently introduced work-hour restrictions, have made the delivery of minimally invasive surgical education a challenging endeavor. Much work has been done in academic and private institutions to address this need. Solutions traversing the spectrum of technology have been developed, tested, and implemented in training. The purpose of this review is to highlight these solutions on the basis of their validity, utility, and overall contribution toward achieving the goal of producing competent minimally invasive surgeons. The body of literature suggests multiple valid training and assessment constructs exist. However, the overall utility of many validated \"high-end\" training technologies is limited by cost and access. Efforts should be aimed at creating valid training and assessment paradigms that can be applied by the broadest group of trainees, from medical students to surgeons, in active practice.","1329":"This chapter further affirms the safety and efficacy of hemi and total temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reconstruction with the Christensen TMJ Prostheses (TMJ Implants, Inc., Golden, CO, USA). Hemi and total TMJ reconstruction with the Christensen TMJ prostheses was first introduced by Robert W. Christensen, DDS in 1961 and 1965, respectively, and is gaining widespread acceptance as a viable alternative in the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD). The Christensen TMJ devices have been used to treat various disorders in large numbers of patients, and the pertinent results of 10 years of study are reported in this chapter.","1330":"Viscosupplementation is a therapeutic modality based on the replacement of synovial fluid or exudates with an elastoviscous hyaluronan solution. The first clinical trials were carried out on race horses with painful osteoarthritis of traumatic origin. In the early 1970s, the clinical trials were extended to painful osteoarthritis in humans. Analgesic effects lasting longer than the residence time of the injected hyaluronan in joints were reported both in horses and humans. The hyaluronan used was a noninflammatory fraction of the molecule with an average molecular weight of 2-3 million at a 1% concentration. The analgesic effect of this elastoviscous hyaluronan solution was demonstrated in behavioral animal pain models. Later it was shown that the elastoviscous properties of hyaluronan solutions are the determining factors in reducing pain-elicited nerve activity in both normal and inflamed cat and rat joints. It also was demonstrated in animal arthritis models that elastoviscous hyaluronan solutions promote the healing of traumatic intra-articular wounds. From the mid-1980s, several hyaluronan preparations of greatly varying average molecular weight but with the same concentration were introduced as viscosupplementation-based therapeutic agents. The elastoviscous properties of these solutions varied also, because of the greatly varying average molecular weights (0.5-6.0 million), imitating the rheological properties of either healthy or pathological synovial fluid. Currently, viscosupplementation products available worldwide vary greatly in their elastoviscous properties, and their dosage is not standardized in terms of frequency of injections required or in regard to the removal of exudates before injection. The question of which patient at what stage of the disease responds best with long-lasting pain relief to the many therapeutic products marketed with greatly varying elastoviscous properties has not yet been answered. At the same time, viscosupplementation was introduced, the same highly elastoviscous hyaluronan solutions also were applied in ophthalmic surgery as viscosurgical tools to protect sensitive tissues in the eye during surgery and to be used as soft instruments for tissue manipulation. Modified hyaluronan products (gels) also were introduced for augmentation of the intercellular matrix in tissues (viscoaugmentation) and for separating tissues to prevent adhesions and excessive scar formation (viscoseparation). Hyaluronan and its derivatives (gels) also have been used for drug delivery. The therapeutic use of highly elastoviscous solutions and gels of hyaluronan and its derivatives to build intercellular matrices for supplementation, regeneration, and developing new tissues introduced the concept of matrix engineering into medical practice.","1331":"The operative treatment of bone fractures using plates and screws is a standard successful technique. Internal fixation with plates and screws leads to additional trauma and disturbance of the bone blood supply, which increases the risk of delayed union and infection. However, problems also are encountered in the fixation of osteoporotic bone. The locked internal fixator technique is an approach to optimize internal fixation. It aims at flexible elastic fixation to imitate spontaneous healing, including induction of callus formation. The technology supports what is currently called \"minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis\" (MIPO), which provides priority to biology over mechanics. An implant system called \"Locking Compression Plate (LCP)\" was developed, based on many years of experience with compression plating and good clinical results obtained with internal fixators, such as the Less Invasive Stabilization Systems (LISS). It combines the two treatment methods (ie, the compression plating and locked internal fixation methods) into one system. This chapter describes the basic principles of locked internal fixators and some clinical results with the LISS and LCP systems to illustrate the potential of these new systems.","1332":"Every year, approximately 2 million people experience a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Approximately 600,000 of these people are diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism and about 10% of these die. It has been established that surgery, anesthesia, and bed rest increase the risk of DVT, and therefore, patients who undergo a major lower-extremity procedure should receive prophylaxis. During the past 10 years, the choices of pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis have increased greatly. Warfarin is probably the most widely used prophylactic method in the U.S., but low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use has increased. Also available is a synthetic pentasaccharide that acts as an anti-Xa inhibitor to decrease DVT without increase in bleeding. All but warfarin are given by subcutaneous injection and require no laboratory management to adjust the medication. Another drug in clinical trials is a direct thrombin inhibitor taken orally in a fixed dose that does not require monitoring. Non-pharmacological prophylaxis and\/or stacked modalities, although used, have not shown the efficacy of pharmacological prophylaxis. With the incidence of DVT reported in the range of 41% to 85% without prophylaxis in joint replacement and hip-fracture surgery, prophylaxis is warranted in all lower-extremity joint replacement and hip-fracture patients.","1333":"All lines of development in Computer Aided Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS) can be seen as critical steps in a broader effort to innovate the orthopaedic field. CAOS addresses the need to perfect implant placement and joint alignment. Minimally invasive techniques represent equally important new developments in the field of arthroplasty. It seems inevitable that these two fields converge. A navigation system for a minimally invasive approach to the hip would follow these primary design concepts: pure intraoperative system, planning included on plane X-rays, small trackers for acetabular and femoral navigation, control of leg-length change through implant placement as well as joint offset, kinematic test of range of motion (ROM).","1334":"THR has become one of the most widely performed operations in orthopaedic surgery. In Germany, more than 180,000 THRs are currently done annually with increasing tendency. We use four different types of endoprostheses: (1) cemented, (2) cement-less, (3) hybrid (cement-free implanted socket and cemented stem), and (4) hemi-endoprosthesis (cemented stem without socket). A total number of 600 patients were included in a prospective follow-up study during 5 to 20 years, with a mean follow-up period of 10 years. The relevant question of whether to use a cemented, hybrid, or cement-free version of THR is, in our opinion, no longer a concern. All the methods have their advantages, disadvantages, indications, and contraindications. After the \"Endler-era\", significant differences are not noted between the groups of cemented, hybrid, and cement-less implants that impact on the clinical results and loosening rates.","1335":"Within the minimally invasive-operation techniques, small approaches are desirable in many fields of the surgery to reduce soft-tissue trauma; however, the risk exists that the surgeon will lose the general view of the topographic structures. The remedy lies in computer navigation with the OrthoPilot. This navigation system has already been used successfully for knee endoprosthesis. A special software was developed for use of the navigation-system, OrthoPilot, for ACL reconstruction. This system is capable of determining the exact optimum position of tunnel replacement by computer navigation. This determination is made by a high-precisive infra-red camera and rigid bodies fixed onto the patient. The experience gained in performing 150 ACL reconstructions to date demonstrates the ease of handling, reduction in extra operation time to a minimum of 10-15 minutes, and only minimal trauma by fixing the rigid bodies. In all cases, an optimum position was documented for the tunnel replacement. Furthermore, no expensive pre-operation x-rays (CT scan, nuclear spin) are needed. Use of the computer-assisted navigation system demonstrated that femoral and tibial tunnel replacement can be positioned precisely. Thus, a false position of the tunnel replacement, the main cause of' transplant-failure, can be avoided. The OrthoPilot is an important support system for both less-experienced and experienced surgeons when performing surgical ACL revisions.","1336":"Hamstring tendon autografts have, over the past decade, increasingly become the graft of choice for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions. Studies have shown that multiply stranded hamstring grafts have superior biomechanical characteristics when compared to patellar tendon autografts. Harvests of hamstring tendons have been shown to cause less donor-site morbidity than the harvest of patellar bone-tendon-bone grafts. Historically, however, fixation methods for hamstring grafts have limited their successful use. Fixation for both the tibia and femur distant from the intra-articular portions of the graft decreased the stiffness of the construct. The fixation also contributed to tunnel widening and ganglion formation. New methods have been developed to maximize the mechanical strengths of hamstring grafts and optimize biological factors in healing of the graft to the bone tunnels. Femoral cross-pin fixation provides secure fixation close to the knee joint, while also allowing for placement of the graft in the native ACL footprint at the far posterior aspect of the intercondylar notch. Tibial interference screw fixation allows fixation close to the joint as well. Addition of the interlock pin through the interference screw increases pullout strength significantly. Recent advances in material science have led to the development of bioabsorbable implants that afford high initial fixation strengths while limiting subsequent complications from permanent hardware.","1337":"Patella baja, that can be divided into congenital, acquired, or a combination of the two, is commonly encountered in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Congenital patella baja refers to a patella distal in relationship to the femoral trochlea and present since an early age. Acquired patella baja may occur secondary to distal positioning of the patella relative to the femoral trochlea or shortening of the patellar tendon, as a result of trauma or surgery. Patella baja also can occur postoperatively as a result of scarring and shortening of the patellar tendon, scarring of the patellar tendon to the anterior aspect of the tibia, or both. Another cause of acquired patella baja seen commonly in TKA is elevation of the joint line, referred to as pseudo-patella baja. The patella remains in a normal position relative to the femoral trochlea; however, the distance between the patella and tibia is narrowed. Pseudo-patella baja can be a result of tibial or femoral over-resection, which necessitates a large polyethylene insert. Alterations of the patello-tibial distance can occur during TKA by excessive soft-tissue release that requires elevation of the joint to regain stability and placement of the patellar polyethylene component distally on the patella. Prevention is the easiest way to avoid potential problems with patella baja during TKA; however, the surgeon is often confronted with this situation during total knee revisions. Failure to address patella baja can lead to decreased range of motion (ROM), a decreased lever arm, extensor lag, impingement of the patella against the tibial polyethylene or tibial plate, anterior knee pain, increased energy expenditure, and rupture of the patellar or quadriceps tendons. Treatment of patella baja first depends on determining the cause and distinguishing between patella baja and pseudo-patella baja. Five different methods to measure patella baja are reviewed and include: (1) Blumensaat's line, (2) Insall-Salvati ratio, (3) Modified Insall-Salvati ratio, (4) Blackburne-Peel, and (5) Caton-Deschamps. Corrective measures include reestablishing the joint line by use of distal femoral augments, tibial tubercle osteotomy with proximal displacement, lengthening of the patellar tendon, shaving of the anterior portion of the tibial polyethylene, and placement of the patellar implant in a cephalad position.","1338":"This chapter describes a technique for reconstruction of the knee extensor mechanism disruption after total knee replacement (TKR). Disruption of the knee extensor mechanism is an infrequent but serious complication. The options for treatment include observation, bracing, fixation with sutures or staples, autologous-tissue augmentation with use of the semitendinosus or gracilis tendon, turndown of the quadriceps tendon and reconstruction with an intercalary allograft. These options have been associated with a high risk of complications and have not addressed the associated problems of contracted devascularized skin flaps or deficient patellar bone stock. The medial gastrocnemius flap has been shown to be suitable for providing soft-tissue coverage of the proximal aspect of the tibia, knee, and distal aspect of the femur. Historically the technique for reconstruction of the extensor mechanism was described for limb salvage after resection of proximal aspect of the tibia for malignant tumors. This described technique is an adaptation of such previously accepted techniques for disruption of the extensor mechanism after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The use of a medial or an extended medial gastrocnemius flap appears to be a reliable option for reconstruction of a ruptured extensor mechanism after TKA.","1339":"The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the clinical and radiographic results of the Maxim Posterior Stabilized Constrained (PCS) (Biomet Orthopaedics, Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA) knee system using the hybrid fixation versus the fully cemented fixation of stems of the same length. The cohort in this study included 115 knees in 104 patients, with a minimum 2-year follow up postoperatively. All patients were evaluated with the Knee Society clinical rating score and roentgenographic evaluation. Of the 115 revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) cases, the hybrid-fixation technique was used on both the femoral and tibial components of 75 (Group I-hybrid femur, hybrid tibia); the fully cemented technique was used on both components of 24 (Group II-cemented femur, cemented tibia); the hybrid-fixation technique was used on the femoral component and full cement on the tibial component of 13 (Group III-hybrid femur, cemented tibia); the femoral component was fully cemented, and tibial component had the hybrid-fixation technique used on 3 (Group IV-cemented femur, hybrid tibia). The average follow up was 44 (range: 24-126) months. At the most recent evaluation, the Knee Society score improved from an average preoperative value of 51.7 to 76.7, the pain score improved from 14.0 to 33.3, and the functional score improved from 40.5 to 47.0. The average stem-to-canal fill ratio was 80% in the femur and 85% in the tibia (p&lt;0.05). Stem-to-canal fill ratio did not appear to influence clinical outcome. Radiolucent lines less than 2 cm were observed more frequently in the hybrid-cemented stems (89%) than the fully cemented stems (58%) at an average 8-year follow up postoperatively (p&lt;0.05). A lower, but not statistically significant, failure rate was observed in the hybrid group in comparison with the cemented group.","1340":"Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) for total knee replacement was first approved for use in the U.S. in 2001. Since its introduction, however, there has been a rapid expansion of this technology and several different types of navigation systems have been developed by several different manufacturers. Each new version of the software has incorporated increasingly sophisticated analysis modules to allow not only accurate alignment of the limb and component position, but also to assess ligament balance and knee kinematics. The purpose of this chapter is to review the basic elements of CAS, the author's clinical experience, and improvements currently being developed with this technology.","1341":"Ischemic steal syndrome (ISS) is an uncommon complication of arteriovenous (AV) access placement. Distal revascularization interval ligation (DRIL) is an alternative to preserve AV access and resolve ISS simultaneously. This case illustrates the problem of ISS and tissue loss, and its successful treatment after undergoing the DRIL procedure. Other options for management of ISS also are reviewed.","1342":"The Bentall operation is preferred when a diseased aortic valve is associated with a dilated or dissected ascending aorta. Composite valved grafts have been devised to facilitate and expedite this procedure. The initial clinical results of the Bentall procedure using a vascular conduit modified to incorporate \"pseudosinuses of Valsalva,\" with the aim of simplifying coronary button anastomoses and decreasing tension upon them, is described herein. Over a period of 40 months since its introduction, the novel conduit has been used, for a Bentall procedure in 37 consecutive patients. Of this group, 31 were men and 6 were women, with a mean age of 63.8+\/-9.9 years. Five were Marfan patients, 8 were patients after acute or chronic dissection, and 8 were patients who required redo procedures. In 22 patients, the modified conduit was used in association with a biological valve (4 stentless valve) and in 15, with a mechanical valve. The mean durations of CPB and X-clamp time were 117+\/-32 and 88+\/-22 minutes, respectively. No operative or late deaths occurred after a mean follow-up period of 20+\/-12 months. This study indicates that the new vascular prosthesis appears to facilitate implantation by maintaining a more natural shape of the reconstructed aortic root.","1343":"This study was a retrospective analysis of both the efficacy and long-term outcome of endovascular management of thoracic aortic disease. From March 1999 to August 2003, 129 patients (110 males; 19 females) were enrolled. They were divided into four groups: aneurysms (41, 5 of which acutely ruptured, Group A), post-traumatic lesions (24, 14 acute and 10 chronic, Group B) and complicated type B dissections (42, 23 acute and 19 chronic, Group C). Twenty-two of the 129 patients with chronic type B dissection, not suitable for endovascular treatment, received medical management only (Group D). All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scan and angiography as preoperative assessment. Stent-graft systems were Talent -Medtronic, Excluder-Gore, Zenith-Cook and Endofit-Endomed, deployed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) monitoring. An optimal deployment with sealing of the graft was achieved in 95.3% (102\/107) of the treated patients discharged in good condition within 6 days. Five patients (3 in Group A and 2 in Group C) underwent endovascular completion of the elephant trunk technique successfully. In 5 patients affected by atherosclerotic aneurysm, in a single-time procedure, we have also treated the abdominal aortic aneurysm by endovascular. No spinal cord injuries were observed. The follow up (average: 20.82+\/-10.01 months), performed with serial chest CT scans, was 100% complete. No stent-graft related complications were detected. In 2 patients with chronic dissection, an asymptomatic type II endoleak was detected. A total of 4 hospital deaths resulted in an overall operative mortality rate of 3.7%. Seven patients (6.5%) died during the follow-up period, whereas a 31.8% (7\/22) mortality rate (p&lt;0.001) was observed within the medical treatment group. Endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic diseases, even in the acute phase, may represent a valid option, especially when compared to medical therapy.","1344":"Our institution has performed over 100 robot-assisted mitral valve repairs. The procedure has shown many advantages to conventional sternotomy-based repair. However, the robotic approach leads to longer cross-clamp and bypass times than conventional sternotomy. As a result of the increased risk of myocardial damage and arrhythmias from lengthy arrest times, nitinol U-clips have been used in the laboratory and currently in patients for the tissue-annuloplasty ring approximation. The technology replaces the time-consuming task of knot tying, as well as provides better visualization during placement of the annuloplasty ring. The animal studies show excellent tissue incorporation. Short-term echocardiographic imaging shows durability without evidence of mitral stenosis or regurgitation. Further studies are ongoing in our patient population, and the data suggest shorter, more efficient and effective robot-assisted mitral valve repairs.","1345":"Clinical and basic science research in endometriosis has been severely hampered by the lack of accurate noninvasive diagnostic tools. The advent of powerful genomic and proteomic technology may help elucidate the etiology and pathophysiology of this complex and enigmatic disease and open new avenues for diagnosis and treatment. Genomic techniques have demonstrated that certain gene products are abnormally expressed in endometriotic tissues.","1346":"The Tension-free Vaginal Tape (TVT) procedure is the first of a new generation of minimally invasive operations for treatment of female urinary stress incontinence. A new theory of the cause of stress incontinence, the \"Mid-urethra Theory,\" was the basis for development of the TVT operation. Systematic, prospective clinical trials have proved the TVT procedure is effective and safe in curing stress incontinence. Assessed by strict objective and subjective outcome measures, cure rates of 85% were reported, with another 5%-10% being improved significantly. The method is equally effective in groups of patients with uncomplicated genuine stress incontinence, recurrent incontinence, mixed incontinence, and those with intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Careful prospective registering of complications associated with the procedure indicate complication rates are low when proper training is provided and the operation is performed in its standardized method. Five years of follow up show a cure rate of 85%, which indicates little decline in cure rates by time. Preliminary analysis of seven-year results shows a cure rate of 81%.","1347":"Endometrial ablation is an excellent alternative to hysterectomy in women with menorrhagia and small intramural fibroids. Preoperative evaluation, which includes office hysteroscopy or saline infusion sonography, is critical to patient management and choice of procedure. A vast array of endometrial ablation technology is available currently that includes balloon therapy, cryosurgery hot circulating saline, bipolar impedance technology, and microwave: (1) ThermaChoice UTB System (Gynecare, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA), (2) Uterine Balloon Therapy (UBT) System, HerOption Uterine Cryoblation Therapy System (American Medical Systems, Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA), (3) Hydro ThermAblator HTA System (BEI Medical\/Boston Scientific, Natick, MA), (4) NovaSure System (Novacept, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and (5) Microsulis Microwave Endometrial Ablation (MEA) System (Microsulis Medical Ltd., Pompano Beach, FL, USA). Each method is described herein, and Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data (SSED) data for each product are reviewed.","1348":"Theodor Kocher is credited with refining the technique of thyroidectomy and reducing the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage. He also recognized the importance of preservation of the parathyroid glands. His accomplishments led to a reduction in surgical mortality, from 50% to less than 4.5%. Additional improvements in technique have reduced the mortality rate to near zero. Morbidity, however, remains a concern for surgeons who perform thyroid surgery. Complications and sequelae of thyroid surgery are reviewed, including recurrent and superior laryngeal nerve injury, temporary hypocalcemia, permanent hypoparathyroidism, thyroid storm, bleeding, wound infection, and hypothyroidism. The association between the volume of thyroidectomies performed by a surgeon and outcome is also discussed in this chapter.","1349":"Careful staging of hepatic tumors forms the basis of appropriate selection of, and is a precondition for, customized treatment. Advances in radiodiagnostic technology have increased the sensitivity of noninvasive liver staging by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and helical CT (HCT). Nevertheless, surgical exploration and intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) are considered the \"gold standard.\" The value of HCT and IOUS was investigated in patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) (group A; n=23) or hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (group B; n=52). In group A, the results of liver imaging (HCT performed immediately before OLT, IOUS) were compared with histopathological results after 3-mm slicing of the explanted liver. In group B, patients were evaluated by CT (n=8), HCT (n=43), MRI (n=18), or both, as indicated by the respective surgeon. The results were compared with those of surgical exploration and IOUS (n=52), as well as with the pathological examination of the resected liver specimen. In group A, 52 malignant lesions were detected by histopathology. By each of the preoperative examinations (IOUS, HCT), 54 lesions were suspected of being malignant. Thirteen HCCs were missed by HCT (for IOUS: n=4) and 15 lesions were false-positive (for IOUS: n=6). Thirty-nine of 52 lesions were verified to be true-positive by HCT in contrast to 48\/52 by IOUS, which resulted in sensitivities of 75% (HCT) and 92% (IOUS, P=0.017), respectively. In group B, the sensitivity of CT was 77%, HCT 90%, MR 93%, and IOUS 99% (P&lt;0.01). In 10%, the strategy of surgical treatment was changed because of IOUS findings. IOUS offered relevant additional information in 6%. Even after sufficient preoperative evaluation, IOUS can provide additional information that frequently has a remarkable impact on surgical decision-making. Identification of HCC is commonly hampered by coexistent cirrhosis. Identification of lesions and orientation of borders to non-tumorous tissue are assessed reliably by IOUS. Thus, IOUS remains a mandatory tool in patients treated by locoregional surgical modalities such as resection, cryotherapy, and intraoperative ethanol instillation for HCC even after refinement of radiological technologies.","1350":"Laparoscopic hepatic resection represents an alternative to open surgery in patients with advanced underlying hepatic disease. Management of haemorrhage and the risk of gas embolism are the major problems in laparoscopic liver surgery. In this study, safety and efficacy of liver dissection using ultrasonic energy was investigated in hand-assisted versus total laparoscopic surgery. The study had a special emphasis on evaluating the risk of gas embolism during both procedures. Female pigs were divided into two groups for A) total laparoscopic (n=7), and B) hand-assisted laparoscopic (n=7) hepatic resection. For tissue dissection, an ultrasound aspirator (CUSA) was used in both groups. Laparoscopic procedure was performed under a CO2 pneumoperitoneum (intraperitoneal pressure: 12 mmHg). Before dissection, a Pringle manoeuver was carried out. The anaesthetized pigs were monitored haemodynamically by an arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed with special attention to the right atrium and ventricle. Gas emboli were graded according to size and correlated with haemodynamic and blood-gas data. In both groups, the ultrasound-aspirator enabled an effective tissue dissection. In total laparoscopic hepatic resection, TEE monitoring disclosed gas embolism in 5\/7 (71%) animals. In 3\/7 (42%) animals, gas embolism was accompanied by a sequence of cardiac arrhythmia. No direct correlation was noted between episodes of embolism and blood-gas variables. None of the pigs died after episodes of embolization. In hand-assisted liver resection, no air embolism was noted. The internal hand impressively facilitated organ exposure and provided an immediate and efficient haemorrhage control. The use of an ultrasound aspirator system enables an effective laparoscopic hepatic dissection. Total laparoscopic liver dissection is at increased risk for gas embolism, whereas hand-assisted laparoscopic procedure appears to reduce this risk. Due to tactile response and facilitated retraction of the liver parenchyma, the hand-assisted procedure shows impressive advantages in laparoscopic liver surgery.","1351":"Surgery of the groin hernia has become more a question of the applied tension-free, mesh technique. Whereas studies on laparascopic versus open tension-free hernia repair or open-mesh versus open-nonmesh repair have been performed sufficiently, data regarding the open tension-free plug-and-patch technique are rather poor. During the period from January 2001 to October 2003, we followed and filed 766 hernia repairs in the plug-and-patch technique of Rutkow. Follow up was during the hospital stay, 4 weeks, and minimally 12 months after operation. The main follow-up variables were complications, recurrence rate, and pain. The mean operating time was 37.8 +\/- 15.85 (12-135) minutes. In 141 (19.3%) patients (n=730), the ilioinguinal nerve was resected. The 1 intraoperative complication that occurred was a severed small intestine. Length of hospital stay was 2.09 +\/- 1.35 (0-17) days, work leave lasted for 15.3 +\/- 12.42 (0-60) days, and return to normal daily activities was possible within 6.54 +\/- 6.86 (0-35) days. Twenty-two (2.9%) patients (n=766) developed a postoperative hematoma as the most common complication, and a reoperation was required 17 (2.2%) times during the hospital stay. Early complications included hematoma (3.7%), seroma (3.5%), infection (0.2%), necrosis of 1 testicle (0.2%), persisting scrotal swelling (1.5%), persisting pain (0.9%), and hypoesthesia (2.4%). Within 4 weeks, 4 (0.9%) patients were reoperated for 1 seroma, hematoma, infection, and testicle necrosis. After 605.4 +\/- 154.5 (365-1018) days, the following 19 (5.7%) patient complaints were noted: persisting pain (2.1%), hypoesthesia (1.8%), foreign-body feeling (0.6%), scrotal swelling (0.6%), and 1 (0.3%) mesh dislocation. Six (1.8%) reoperations have been performed. The overall recurrence rate was 1.8% (n=6), for primary 1.5% (n=4), and 3.3% (n=2) for recurrent hernias; 96.3% of the patients would agree to undergo the same operation a second time. Tension-free repair of the inguinal hernia by the plug-and-patch technique is a quick and secure method that simplifies hernia surgery without compromising the high-quality standards such as a low recurrence rate and low pain load of the patient. Patients had a fast recovery with a subsequent short work leave. The method is a simple, effective, and economical operation, suitable as a standard performed in local anesthesia on an out-patient basis.","1352":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an adequate prosthetic mesh fixation in laparoscopic preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair can be achieved with fibrin sealant (FS) (Tisseel trade mark, Hyland\/Immuno Div., Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA), and compare it with stapled fixation. The use of staples for prosthetic mesh fixation in laparoscopic preperitoneal hernia repair is associated with a small but significant number of complications, mainly nerve injury and hematomas. An alternative method of fixation should be as efficient as staples in preventing graft migration. An experimental study was conducted using swine models to compare the efficacy of polypropylene mesh fixation with FS to that achieved with staples and to non-fixed mesh grafts in the preperitoneal groin area. Twenty-five female pigs were used in the study. In each pig, a prosthetic mesh was placed laparoscopically in the groin area bilaterally and fixed with either FS, staples, or left without fixation. The pigs were killed after 12 days. The following outcome measures were evaluated: macroscopic findings including graft alignment and motion, tensile strength between the grafts and surrounding tissues, and histologic findings (fibrous reaction and inflammatory response). The procedures were completed laparoscopically in 49 sites. FS was used to fix 18 grafts; 16 with staples, and 15 were not fixed. No significant difference was noted in graft motion between the FS and staple groups. The non-fixed grafts had a median motion of 5 mm (range: 0 to 10 mm), significantly more than the FS fixed (p&lt;0.01) and stapled grafts (p&lt;0.001). No significant difference was noted in median tensile strength between the FS and staples groups (0.955 Kg vs. 1.03 Kg, respectively) compared with 0.46 Kg in the non-fixed group (p&lt;0.01). FS triggered a significantly stronger fibrous reaction and inflammatory response than those observed in the staples and control groups. An adequate mesh fixation in the extraperitoneal inguinal area can be accomplished using FS, based on our experimental evidence. The FS is equivalent to fixation achieved by staples and superior to no fixation. Soft fixation with FS prevents graft migration and avoids complications associated with use of staples.","1353":"Bariatric surgery is a rapidly growing discipline in General Surgery. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) is currently the most commonly performed bariatric surgical procedure for treatment of morbid obesity in the United States (U.S). The laparoscopic approach to (GBP) has led to a greater acceptance for surgical treatment of morbid obesity by the public and, in return, more surgeons are becoming interested in learning laparoscopic bariatric surgery to meet the high demand. Laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding was approved in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in 2001, and is emerging as an alternative laparoscopic option in management of morbid obesity. This chapter reviews the indications, techniques, and outcomes of laparoscopic GBP vs. laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. The advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding compared to laparoscopic GBP is discussed.","1354":"Parallel with the rise of the obesity pandemic, bariatric surgery is quickly becoming one of the most frequently performed GI procedures. In selected, well-informed patients, restrictive surgery offers a good alternative to more complex malabsorption-inducing procedures. Laparoscopic gastric banding is a reversible, technically straightforward procedure. Both early and late complications seen with the original models are less common with the Swedish adjustable gastric band SAGB (Ethicon Endosurgery, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Dilbeek, Belgium) engineered as a low-pressure device. This chapter is a review of our experience with the SAGB and provides an overview of current controversies regarding its place in management of severe obesity.","1355":"The surgical treatment of obesity with proximal gastric partition and Roux-en-Y intestinal bypass is recognized as effective in producing meaningful weight loss of excess body weight. Pure laparoscopic surgery has been perfected by a small number of surgeons in the United States. To acquire this new skill requires extensive training and supervision. In the hands of inexperienced operators, it is associated with prolonged surgery times and significant complications. Hand-assisted laparoscopic (HAL) surgery has been developed as an alternative method of minimally invasive surgery that can increase the number of surgeons who can offer laparoscopic surgery to their obese patients while decreasing the case load necessary to obtain expertise. The technique and approach of HAL surgery is presented in detail.","1356":"Success in robotic minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been limited despite the innovations in robotic technology for surgical applications. Human factors engineering approach to the design and implementation of this technology is major to improving system performance and patient safety. The engineering discipline of human factors involves the study of factors and development of tools that enable human interaction with systems in a safe and effective manner. Human factors contribution is important to the product design life cycle, as it supports the design of a product capable of supporting, extending, and transforming user work in a cost-effective and timely fashion. A framework for modelling the interaction between the surgeon and technology in MIS is presented. This approach allows for identification of requirements and constraints at the physical, functional, and cognitive levels, which in turn guides the design of the technology and its interface. The human factors approach is expected to increase the effectiveness of the technology when deployed.","1357":"Telemedicine, the use of telecommunications technologies to deliver health services over a distance, is emerging as an innovative tool for the field of surgery. Recent feasibility and demonstration projects have documented the potential of telesurgery, the performance of a surgical intervention by a surgeon not physically located with the patient. However, the use of telemedicine for surgical services expands beyond telepresence surgery to include telementoring, teleproctoring, teleconferencing, and teleconsulting. This chapter overviews the current status of telemedicine applications across the full range of surgical care, which include training, preoperative, operative, and postoperative follow up. Although telesurgery garners the most attention, the paper concludes with the argument that the actual mainstay for telesurgery is the telemedicine components offered in the continuum of surgical services.","1358":"The serious clinical and economic impact of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease is undisputed. What concerns practitioners and researchers alike is the seeming inability to truly mitigate the ramification of VTE, especially in the post-surgical or postoperative subpopulation, in whom the risk of VTE is disproportionately high and often asymptomatic. Ironically, current approaches to the diagnostic evaluation of suspected VTE patients tend to favor the application of anatomic modalities, either invasive or technically challenging (eg, venography) or the performance of which is clinically inadequate (eg, ultrasonography) for post-surgical\/postoperative patients. These modalities' primary principle of detection rely on the effects or results of an intricate pathophysiologic process, seemingly ignoring the critical role and potentially better prognostic value of endogenous hemostatic mechanisms. In other words, are we using the correct tools to seek the appropriate types of information in patients with suspected VTE? Research in nuclear medicine techniques for detecting VTE began approximately 25 years ago. Recently, the emergence of radiolabeled peptides as a clinically applicable technology platform has encouraged a different approach to evaluating VTE. Many radiolabeled peptide candidates are undergoing preclinical and clinical research. Currently,only one, 99'Tc-apcitide (AcuTect), has been approved (since 1998) for clinical use in the United States. The growing numbers of physicians with experience using 9mTc-apcitide (including those who remember using \"'In-fibrinogen) has fueled ongoing clinical research to further elucidate the benefits of this unique peptide technology. Consequently, significant insight has been gained from large prospective clinical tri-als, of which one was conducted to support the approval of 99mTc-apcitide in Europe. Furthermore, this insight has kindled increasing interest in 99'Tc-apcitide and potential new entrants into this special \" diagnostic class\" (ie, radiolabeled peptides). Unlike the more popular anatomic modalities, radiolabeled pep-tides circumvent many of the clinical and anatomic challenges to objectively and accurately diagnose VTE. The importance of an objective and accurate diagnosis is understood, because it is paramount to a cost-effective treatment strategy. In addition to describing the current activities concerning the development and use of radiolabeled peptides for clinical practice, this manuscript is intended to promulgate a thought-provoking argument for changing our current approach to the diagnostic evaluation of VTE,which also may transcend the post-surgical\/postoperative subpopulation.","1359":"Minute pieces of debris left in the surgical site can interfere with optimal wound healing. Even when these microbodies are not obvious without magnification, their presence can cause post-surgical complications including infections, amplified and prolonged inflammation, permanent tissue damage, exaggerated and reduced quality scarring, granulomas, adhesions, organ dysfunction, infertility, and other pathological consequences. This chapter reviews foreign debris-initiated, post-surgical complications; presents associated pathological mechanisms; identifies sources of debris contamination; describes foreign-microbody characteristics that can further amplify pathological responses; and presents recommendations for minimizing their presence.","1360":"Biosynthesized cellulose is produced by the bacteria, Acetobacter xylinum, and possesses unique properties not present in other biomaterials. The material is formed during fermentation having a multi-layered structure composed of fine, nonwoven, cellulose hydrophilic fibers. This structure allows biosynthesized cellulose to have a high-fluid capacity, superior strength, and biocompatibility, which makes it suitable for topical and implantable biomedical applications. Initial product development of biosynthesized cellulose has focused on advanced wound-care applications. The product, XCell (Xylos Corporation, Langhorne, PA, USA), has been bioengineered to have the ability to both donate and absorb moisture, depending on the wound environment. Comparative bench testing has shown that XCell is the only wound dressing with this unique dual-fluid-handling capability. The product has been studied thoroughly using animal models and proved to be safe and biocompatible. Human clinical testing has demonstrated its effectiveness in providing a moist environment, essential to treating hard-to-heal chronic wounds. The major clinical benefits of the product include: 1) help in removal of non-viable tissue and promotion of autolytic debridement, which results in increased granulation tissue; 2) cleansing of wound margins that leads to epithelial migration and reduction of wound size; and 3) healing of various types of chronic wounds.","1361":"Technical limitations, mostly related to the issue of time delay for transmission of digitized information, had prevented the development of remote surgery intended as performance of a complete surgical procedure from long distances. To overcome the issue of time delay, tests and researches performed with the joined effort of surgeons, robotic and telecommunication engineers convinced our group that use of the high-speed terrestrial network [asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) service], rather than satellite connections, would significantly reduce the time lag for transmission of data. Using ATM technology, our group demonstrated the feasibility of performing surgery across transoceanic distances by safely carrying out a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, first on an animal model and later (September 7, 2001), on a patient. Using ATM technology, the mean time lag for transmission of data and images was 155 msec despite a total round-trip distance of 14,000 km. Teletransmission of active surgical manipulations have the potential to ensure availability of surgical expertise in remote locations for difficult or rare operations, and improve surgical training worldwide. However, several limitations remain for remote surgery to become commonplace. Among these, the need to render ATM network available to hospitals, costs of technology, ethical and liability issues, and possible conflicts of jurisdictions between countries involved.","1362":"Use of surgical navigation systems is becoming an increasingly important part of both planning and performing intracranial and spinal surgery. Numerous clinical reports have described neuronavigation as a useful adjunct to surgery that allows neurosurgery to be less invasive and more effective. Although the method of image-guided surgery was introduced more than a decade ago, new technologies have changed and refined the procedure substantially. This chapter summarizes the recent developments of advanced image-guided surgery. For most operations, microscope navigation has replaced pointer navigation. Using the microscope as the localizing device, the workflow is not interrupted and microsurgical procedure can be continued as usual. New chip technology allows integration of magnetic resonance images, angiography findings, endoscopic view, or other pictures in the eyepiece of the microscope. A new method of patient registration is laser scanning and surface matching. When using high-quality images, this new method can be used without additionally acquired images, may reduce costs, simplify the pre-registration procedure, and increase application accuracy compared to skin-fiducial registration. Moreover, integration of other imaging modalities is becoming an increasingly used feature and provides useful information during surgery.","1363":"Several hundred thousand peripheral nerve injuries occur each year in Europe and the United States alone, mainly as a result of trauma to the upper extremity. Even after optimal surgical repair, functional outcome--especially sensory recovery--is disappointingly poor. This poor outcome is largely due to death of primary sensory neurons, but also lack of fiber regeneration over the nerve trauma zone and target-organ denervation. The type of nerve repair performed is dependent on the size of the nerve gap between the proximal and distal stumps. Short gaps can be repaired directly by end-to-end coaptation and epineural suturing, whereas long nerve gaps require additional material to bridge the defect, which further reduces the functional outcome. The current repair method to bridge nerve defects is the use of autologous nerve grafts (autografts), which provide the regenerating axons with a natural guidance channel populated with functioning Schwann cells (SC) surrounded by their basal lamina. The first use of nerve grafts in humans was reported in 1878, but the wide use of this technique was developed during World War II when nerve grafting became the standard method for nerve-gap repair. Harvesting of nerve grafts results in co-morbidity that includes scarring, loss of sensation, and possible formation of painful neuroma. The donor nerves often are of small calibre and limited number. As functional recovery in peripheral nerve reconstruction is poor, clearly, alternative method for bridging nerve gaps is needed.","1364":"Composite tissue allografting (CTA) is a relatively new term that appears with increased frequency in the medical and surgical literature. The recent successful allografts, or homotransplantations, of hands has sparked a resurgence of research, both experimental and clinical. Plastic surgeons have long been interested--particularly in the field of skin grafts for extensive burns and wounds--but have been replaced by the organ transplant teams and immunogeneticists. The skin, one of the most strongly antigenic organs, has required such high levels of immunosuppressive drugs to date, that elective transplants of skin and other composite tissues have received little attention.","1365":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating, degenerative disease of the articular cartilage and synovial fluid. Approximately 20 million Americans suffer from this disease for which no cure exists as yet. The primary goals of current OA therapy are centered on controlling pain; improving, preserving, or both, joint function and mobility; and improving health-related quality of life-but not on reversing the disease process. Current treatment options of OA consist of both non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities. Non-pharmacological therapy that consists of patient education and physical\/occupational therapy is a primary component of OA management, either rendered alone or in combination with pharmacological treatment. The several options for pharmacological treatment include acetaminophen, nonspecific NSAIDs, and COX-2 specific inhibitors. Many of these drugs, however, are beset with serious side effects. For patients with severe OA not responsive to medical treatment, nonsurgical interventions such as viscosupplements and injectable compounds that mimic healthy synovial fluid or surgical interventions are two likely options. The former, however, have not been shown unequivocally to be effective. Future treatment modalities for OA are geared toward reversing the disease process and may include disease-modifying drugs and gene therapy.","1366":"Total knee replacement (TKR) has been well accepted as the definitive knee- salvage procedure. Existence of a predictable, reproducible, salvage procedure has allowed for re-evaluation of other surgical techniques, such as unicompartmental arthroplasty, to prolong or preserve knee function. Knee osteoarthritis has been described as highly segmental, primarily medial, and slowly progressive. Loss of articular cartilage is compensated by development of sclerotic bone, which although it supports weight, it deforms with weight-bearing and produces pain. Ligament imbalance is not compensated. A mini-invasive knee arthroplasty has been developed that features the following three criteria: (1) minimizes physiologic damage, (2) minimizes interference in life style, and (3) avoids interference with future treatment options. Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty can, therefore, be performed as a low-morbidity outpatient procedure while preserving bone for future TKR--in essence, a pre-TKR procedure. Techniques include limited surgical exposure, internal landmarks for prosthetic insertion, and pain management to facilitate out-patient status.","1367":"The goal of using navigation systems in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is to minimise malpositioned components, increase range of motion, and decrease the risk of dislocation, which may result in long-term stability. The two systems used to navigate the acetabular component are CT-based and fluoroscopy-based. Between May 2001 and May 2002, surgery was performed on 153 patients using navigation systems for cup positioning. The CT-based system was used in 46 patients and fluoroscopy-based system in 107. The diagnoses were primary osteoarthritis in 120 of the patients, and secondary osteoarthritis following congenital and post-traumatic deformities in 33. The outcomes of the operations were investigated clinically and radiologically. Mean variation of the postoperative abduction angle to the preoperative planning was 2.7  (0-8) after CT-based navigation and 3.9 (0-9) after fluoroscopy-based navigation. After the first 30 surgeries with each system, the operating time was extended by 9 minutes using the CT-based system and by 13 minutes with the fluoroscopy-based system compared to hand implantation. Also, the preoperative planning using the CT-based system was more time-consuming. No additional planning was necessary with the fluoroscopy-based system was used. Both systems were accurate and provided an improved reproducible quality. The CT-based system provided a link between the preoperative planning and intraoperative placement of acetabular components. Only a minimal difference was noted when compared to the fluoroscopy-based procedure; however, the time-consuming set up remains a problem. The advantage in using the CT-based system is the three-dimensional feed back of anatomic landmarks, but a disadvantage is the time-consuming preoperative procedure (CT-scan, data transfer, planning). For this reason the CT-based method should be performed in cases of congenital and post-traumatic deformities. The fluoroscopy-based method is easier to handle in routine cases with normal anatomy or lesser deformities. Both systems present an excellent additional tool to improve reproducible quality in THA.","1368":"The OrthoPilot (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) Knee Navigation System represents a computed tomography (CT)-free system. In older software versions, a rigid-body at the iliac crest was necessary to calculate the centre of the hip. The latest software versions, 3.0 and 4.0, use a new mathematical algorithm to reconstruct the mechanical axis. Using the OrthoPilot system, an intraoperative cinematic study can be done that results in calculation of the mechanical axis and navigation of resection cuts. According to flexion- and extension-gap balancing, the anterior\/posterior (a.p.) position and rotation of the femoral component also are navigated. Thirty navigated SEARCH (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) total knee arthroplasties (TKA) using the software version 3.0 of an uninterrupted series were evaluated, versus 30 navigated knees using older software and a manual group. Results concerning alignment were determined to be superior to the older navigation and manual groups. The number of cases with a good mechanical axis, 0; low; or 2 of deviation from optimum, was reached in 17 of the manual, 19 of the older-version, and 27 of the newer-version navigation cases. More features were solved in a convincing manner. The numbers of ouliers were diminished. Navigation in TKA using the OrthoPilot has become more safe and effective.","1369":"Endoscopic spine surgery is evolving rapidly due to improvements in surgical technique, endoscope design, and instrumentation. The current technique expands on the basic features and principles of Kambin's access to the spine through the triangular zone. A standardized method for foraminal surgery, the Yeung Endoscopic Spine System (YESS) (Richard Wolf Surgical Instrument Company, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA) technique is proposed: (1) A protocol for optimal instrument placement by identifying the skin window, annular window, anatomic disc center, and disc inclination plane through topographical coordinates calculated by lines drawn on the skin from the C-Arm image. Adjustments in the trajectory are made to accommodate individual anatomic considerations and the pathologic disorders to be accessed. (2) Evocative Chromo-Discography (Richard Wolf Surgical Instrument Company, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA). (3) Selective Endoscopic Discectomy (Richard Wolf Surgical Instrument Company, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA). (4) Thermal discoplasty and annuloplasty. (5) Endoscopic foraminoplasty. (6) Accessing the epidural space in the axilla between the traversing and exiting nerve root. (7) Partially resecting the posterior annulus to get beneath the herniated fragment, if needed. This technique allows access to the epidural space from the lumbar disc as far cephalad as the middle of the vertebral body or approximately 2-3 mm caudally. The foraminal approach is routinely accessible from T-10 to L4-5. L5-S1 can be accessed with special techniques that include foraminoplasty of the lateral facet. Surgical results continue to improve, consistent with refinement of indications and techniques for specific conditions treatable by this endoscopic method.","1370":"Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft in the press-fit technique is an efficient procedure, which provides high primary stability without use of implants and thus ensures early functional rehabilitation. The procedure is based on graft harvest with an oscillating hollow saw, which allows collection of cylindrical bone blocks. Femoral fixation using a template and file has been standardized to an extent that ensures secure press-fit fixation. Tibial anchorage is achieved by refilling the tibial tunnel with the bone cylinder removed previously. Primary stability is at least equivalent to that achieved with interference screw or staple fixation, and has been evaluated in a pull-out study in ovine knees. Two major problems encountered with revision procedures--metal removal or tunnel enlargement--may be avoided effectively. In a prospective study of 32 patients, postoperative computed tomography (CT) evaluation after three months showed presence of cancellous bone material inserted into the tibial tunnel. Postoperative tunnel enlargement seen frequently with other procedures can be avoided in almost all knees. Revision procedures after press-fit fixation can be done without problems. This procedure provides a cost-efficient alternative for reconstruction of the ACL, because it does not require implants.","1371":"The objective of this study is to restore stepping-forward and ambulatory function in paraplegic patients with chronic injuries. Two to four normal vascularized intercostal nerves above the spinal cord injury site were obtained by cutting in the distal end at the midclavicular line. The proximal ends were disconnected from the levatores costarum. Nerves were then transferred to the vertebral canal through a submuscle tunnel and sutured with the selected fascicula of lumbar nerve roots (L 1\/2 or L 3\/4) by epiperineurial neurorrhaphy in the subdura or extradura. If the selected intercostal nerve was not of sufficient length to reach the specific lumbar region, a sural nerve segment was isolated, sheared into two segments, and attached to the intercostal nerve for grafting. Twenty-three patients, whose injury sites were between the thoracic T9 and T12 levels, were followed postoperatively for a period ranging from 2 to 11 (average: 3.5) years. Of these patients, 18 (78%) regained the stepping-forward function and were able to walk with crutches or other ambulatory assistive devices. In addition, 21 (91%) patients had improved thigh sensation. This intercostals nerve rerouting procedure restores significant stepping-forward and, in turn, ambulatory function and thigh muscle sensation in paraplegic patients.","1372":"After attempting various types of research performed in different laboratories, this article describes the author's research that began in 1980 on rats, and continued since 1993 on monkeys. Also presented are results of the first clinical cases regarding operations performed either by rerouting the ulnar nerve to the lower limbs, or connecting the rostral stump of the severed cord with peripheral nerves of the hip to obtain rudimentary, but efficient, walking. Recovery occurred well in advance of the expected time, and continues to improve daily. This connection functioned even if the axons that activated the single muscles were from mother cells dispersed in different regions of the brain cortex, which fire together--such as in a teleassembly. Furthermore, function occurred although the upper motorneuron uses the neurotransmitter glutamate, whereas motor end plates use receptors for Acetilcholine. These data are under new investigation to determine whether the upper motorneuron changes the transmitter, or if the motor end plate changes its receptors.","1373":"Pelvic adhesions occur following the vast majority of surgical procedures. Surgical technique is the most important consideration to reducing adhesions. Anti-adhesion adjuvants can further improve adhesion reduction achieved by good surgical technique.","1374":"In addition to established therapies such as radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, a number of newer therapies have been suggested to be effective in treating patients with clinically localized prostate carcinoma (PCA). One of these is cryoablation, a procedure that infarcts the prostate by the in situ application of percutaneous cryoprobes. Although results with this approach were mixed when introduced initially in 1993, recent improvements in technique and understanding of the mechanisms of cryo-injury in the prostate have led to renewed interest in this treatment option for patients with PCA.","1375":"Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a method of non-invasive vascular imaging that has evolved and improved significantly since first described. In this article, the basic principles of MRA are reviewed and MRA compared with the more conventional imaging techniques of Doppler ultrasound and angiography. The ways in which MRA can be used in conjunction with more conventional vascular imaging techniques in investigation and management of carotid disease, aortic disease, and peripheral vascular disease are discussed in this article.","1376":"Before introduction of endoscopic subfascial dissection, surgical treatment of the perforating veins was a neglected topic. High error rates in the preoperatively marked perforating veins, wound-healing problems due to the incision in trophically disturbed areas, and leg ulcers prevented correct surgical treatment. Endoscopic subfascial dissection allows the accurate elimination of all clinically relevant, insufficient perforating veins in the lower leg. Therefore, it has become an accepted, improved treatment concept in the surgical therapy of primary varicosis in all three stages of chronic venous insufficiency. This experience is demonstrated based on a prospective study of the patients treated in the year 2000.","1377":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common dysrhythmia following open heart surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass. In previous studies, the AF incidence varied between 25.0% and 60.0% of all patients. The conventional treatment of postoperative AF periods consists of antiarrhythmic medication, most frequently calcium channel antagonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, or amiodarone. If the pharmacological treatment is ineffective or leads to further impairment of hemodynamics, external electrical cardioversion under general anesthesia and simultaneous transesophageal echocardiography is performed. Systemic heparinization is recommended to prevent neurological events related to AF. In 1995, a new method for internal electrical cardioversion using epicardial wire electrodes with low shock energies was developed in a canine model. Since June 1997, this device for internal cardioversion that consisted of two multifilament stainless steel wires has been available clinically (TADpole followed by Syncrus heart wires, Guidant Corporation C and VS, Cupertino, California, USA). The safety and efficacy of this innovative strategy for treatment of postoperative AF has been investigated in two pilot studies. These studies demonstrated a success rate of internal cardioversion up to 92.9% with optimized pre-shock treatment that leads to a significant shortening of AF periods, with the expectation of reduction in hospital length of stay.","1378":"Over the last two decades, interventional neuroradiologists have developed powerful techniques for the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders and brain tumors. Current interventional neuroradiological procedures are performed under X-ray fluoroscopy, which has allowed for high temporal and spatial resolution. However, these imaging techniques do not provide the treating physician with vital anatomic and functional information regarding vessel walls and the surrounding brain tissue. Better visualization of vessel structures and real-time information about the state of perfusion and metabolism of the surrounding brain tissue (real-time magnetic resonance arteriography, diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient maps) would enhance safety and efficacy of neuroendovascular procedures available currently. Recent advances in magnetic resonance hardware and software have permitted significant enhancements in temporal and spatial resolution, which have resulted in the capability of visualizing anatomic structures with real-time fluoroscopy and angiography. This review outlines how real-time magnetic resonance procedures may replace conventional X-ray fluoroscopy in diagnostic and interventional neuroradiology during the next decade.","1379":"Pain must be managed during treatment of a patient with a chronic wound. Failure to do so will impair the patient's ability to heal significantly. Understanding the wound's etiology is essential for designing the wound-healing protocol and implementing its pain management regimen, of which a critical part is the chronic-wound patient's self-assessed scores of pain and functionality. In this report we present a paradigm for treating all chronic wounds, which was subsequently applied to 32 consecutive patients. Our integrated-team approach to managing the treatment of wounds includes accurate evaluation of the progression of patients' pain. Directors of the pain-management team and wound team have jointly managed hundreds of patients--either hospitalized or seen in both outpatient clinical practices. The three general categories for etiologies of the 10 most common types of chronic wounds are: ischemia, neuropathy, and direct tissue damage (e.g. pressure ulcers and venous stasis ulcers). Each of these are treated with unique analgesic regimens focused on surgical\/medical management of the wound: oral and parenteral medications in combinations designed to facilitate specific additive analgesic effects and nerve blocks and implantable devices for correcting underlying wound pathophysiology. Successful treatment of pain generally results in increased functional independence and improvement of the patient's quality of life. We integrated wound-care pain-management team established guidelines that delineate the causes of chronic wounds and categorize treatment options for practical clinical use. The expectation is that all pain should be resolved in all patients if both the wound-healing and pain-healthcare providers use current technologies and drugs.","1380":"Although elderly patients have physiologic impairments in wound healing, their wounds should be expected to heal with the same frequency of closure as those in younger populations, albeit at a slower rate. However, compared to the general population, the elderly population has a higher incidence of chronic wounds: diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. Experimental and clinical data indicate physiologically impaired healing is characterized by decreased angiogenesis and synthesis of critical growth factors. Further, compared to younger populations, the elderly have a higher rate of mortality associated with specific morbidities, such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress. As these morbidities may develop directly from the wound, early intervention is mandated. In this report, 40 consecutive elderly patients (65-102 years old) with chronic wounds were analyzed. All patients were provided the same treatment protocol and healing was defined as 100% epithelization and no drainage. Despite the wounds presenting in a nonhealing and\/or infected state, 73% of these chronic wounds in elderly patients healed. This suggests that elderly patients with diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers close their wounds at a similar frequency as younger patients. Therefore, early intervention and comprehensive treatment that includes safe topical therapies, in addition to growth factors and cellular therapy used for chronic wounds, ensure these patients will be spared the morbidities of pain, amputation, osteomyelitis, and even death. We hypothesize that if all elderly patients with chronic wounds are provided early treatment, morbidities (e.g., amputation, sepsis, pain) and associated costs will decrease.","1381":"Percutaneous biopsy of the liver is the most specific test available currently to assess the nature and severity of liver diseases. Image-guidance either before or during the procedure has allowed this technique to be performed on a routine basis. The purpose of this article was to review the indications and contraindications for performing liver biopsy, and describe the spectrum of major and minor complications that can occur following biopsy. Equipment and biopsy needles available currently were compared, and the individual steps involved in ultrasound-guided biopsies described. Blinded versus ultrasound-guided biopsies were compared, and techniques used for selecting the most appropriate site for biopsy, reducing the passes through the liver, and reducing complications were discussed.","1382":"Traditionally, the only curative option for patients with liver tumors has been hepatic resection. Unfortunately, only 10%-20% of patients with liver tumors can undergo surgical resection due to limited hepatic reserve, high surgical risk, or unfavorable tumor location. Ablation of liver tumors is currently the main alternative to formal liver resection. Tumor cell death is achieved through a number of technologies, which may be separated into three categories: chemical (percutaneous ethanol injection), cold-based (cryotherapy), and heat-based (radiofrequency and microwave ablation or laser hyperthermia). Although long-term data are limited, ablation may be curative in some patients with a three- and five-year survival rate approaching that of resection. The main factors to success include proper patient selection, excellent diagnostic and procedural imaging, and careful post-procedure management and follow up. Long-term success following tumor ablation will be most dependent on the underlying tumor biology and the ability to achieve a negative margin. Future directions in ablation will include the use of adjunctive agents such as chemotherapeutics, further advances in energy delivery, improved imaging and lesion targeting, and continued refinements of current technology and technique.","1383":"Laparoscopic repair of large paraesophageal hiatal hernias is associated with several areas of contention. One of these is primary repair of the esophageal hiatus versus repair with the use of a prosthetic mesh material. Those who favor primary repair are concerned because of the risk of erosion of the prosthesis into surrounding viscera. Those who favor hiatal closure with the aid of a prosthetic mesh are concerned because of the relatively high rate of reherniation of the repair. A biodegradable mesh composed of small intestinal submucosa (SIS ES Cook Surgical, Bloomington, IN) may resolve the concerns of the opposing points of view. It has been shown in animal studies to maintain strength while it is gradually resorbed and replaced by native host tissue. Since April of 2000, 12 (8 female, 4 male) patients have had laparoscopic repair of large paraesophageal hiatal hernias with hiatal closure accomplished with this material. Nine of these 12 patients have had barium studies at six months post-procedure and seven at one year. No failures demonstrated.","1384":"Acute cholecystitis is one of the most frequent causes for emergency admissions to General Surgery Departments. Due to the increased morbidity and high-risk of mortality, patients with severe underlying disease or a debilitated general condition are initially treated conservatively by administration of antibiotics, decompression, and drainage of the gallbladder. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is a minimally invasive method of percutaneous placement of a catheter, under ultrasound guidance, in the gallbladder lumen. PC can be performed at the bed-side and help the patient as well as physicians searching for a site and cause of sepsis. Dynamic ultrasound visualization of the puncture needle and gallbladder is crucial to avoid complications. PC cholecystectomy is an efficacious procedure with reported clinical response rates of 56%-100%. Clinical response is considered when a decrease in white blood cell count, defervescence, and decrease in the need for vasopressors are present. Patients with gallstones and symptoms and signs localized to the right upper quadrant are more likely to respond. Mortality is associated mainly with the underlying medical conditions. Ultrasound-guided PC can be followed by elective cholecystectomy at a later stage if the patient's condition permits, or by expectant or conservative management in those with acalculous cholecystitis.","1385":"Since its inception, laparoscopic fundoplication has revolutionized the surgical approach to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Endoluminal therapies for GERD are less invasive than surgery, seek to duplicate its efficacy, and may eliminate reliance on proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and other antisecretory drugs. The Stretta procedure uses radiofrequency (RF) energy delivered to the tissues of the distal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and gastric cardia, which decreases LES compliance, increases LES muscle mass, and limits the inappropriate transient LES relaxations responsible for GERD in many patients. The Stretta procedure has been shown to be effective in laboratory studies, randomized sham-controlled studies, and numerous open-label prospective clinical trials. For patients with appropriate indications, the Stretta procedure is an effective endoluminal therapy for treatment of symptomatic GERD.","1386":"Since the gastric bypass was first described for weight-reduction surgery almost 50 years ago, a number of remarkable contributions have been made to the field. These advances have led to significant modifications of the technique, evolution of laparoscopic bariatric surgery equipment, and improvement of long-term results. Despite the currently wide-spread practice of laparoscopic bariatric surgery, the precise technique for laparoscopic gastric bypass still varies from institution to institution, and the surgery continues to carry a morbidity rate. Advances in laparoscopic equipment, technology, and our understanding of the pathophysiology behind weight loss, have allowed surgeons to modify the procedure described originally to minimize the morbidity and maximize long-term weight loss. This chapter describes the technique of laparoscopic gastric bypass used at a major academic center that performs over 1000 bariatric procedures each year. In addition, the many recent advances in methodology and pathophysiology are described in detail.","1387":"One might think there cannot truly be anything new in hernia repair, but nothing could be further from the truth. Hernia repair has been, and continues to be, written about in considerable volume in the medical literature. Part of this has to do with new techniques for repair, some is due to modifications of old techniques, and much of the recent literature addresses many new meshes available for repair. The developments are in both the inguinal hernia arena, as well as an explosion in the area of ventral\/incisional (V\/I) hernias.","1388":"Computed topography colonography (CTC) was first described in 1994 as a rapid, non-invasive imaging method to investigate the colon and rectum. Since the advent of CTC, it has been regarded as a potential alternative technique to conventional colonoscopy for detection of colorectal polyps and cancers. Patients undergo standard bowel preparation 24 to 48 hours before the procedure, using either a standard barium enema preparation or balanced polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution. This rapid examination, without the use of sedation or intervention, is well-tolerated by patients. The potential for limited bowel preparation can reduce discomfort associated with traditional purging techniques significantly, and result in an improved perception of the screening study. CTC is performed using a single or multislice CT scanner, with acquisition of volumetric data from the entire colon. Multislice technology enables fast scanning with high resolution. To minimize the radiation dose, efforts have been made to adapt the tube current to the minimum accepted dose while not diminishing study performance. Acquired CT data are transferred onto a dedicated workstation equipped with navigator software, which permits the radiologist to obtain multiplanar reformations as well as construct an endoluminal model of the air-distended colon. Currently, the most widely accepted application for CTC is following incomplete colonoscopy. Other indications that await further clinical validation include colorectal screening. The collective experience of published studies shows CTC to be an accurate tool for detection of clinically significant colorectal polyps. Specificity and sensitivity of CTC are excellent for polyps larger than 10 mm.","1389":"Colonic lesions of benign or early malignant origin may be difficult to remove by colonoscopy. However, conventional surgical resection is considered as too invasive for these types of lesions suitable for local excision. The combined laparoscopic-colonoscopic excision was performed in 75 patients (males, 42; females, 33) with benign or early malignant lesions of the colorectum. Three different variations were used: laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic resection (LAER), endoscopy-assisted laparoscopic wedge resection (EAWR), and endoscopy-assisted laparoscopic transluminal resection (EATR). If these techniques were not applicable, an endoscopy-assisted laparoscopic segment resection (EASR) was performed. Conversion rate was 5.0%. Although the expenditure of combined endoscopic\/laparoscopic approaches is higher, they are attractive alternatives to either laparoscopic tubular resection or open surgery.","1390":"Diabetic foot and pressure ulcers are chronic wounds by definition. They share similar pathogeneses; i.e., a combination of increased pressure and decreased angiogenic response. Neuropathy, trauma, and deformity also often contribute to development of both types of ulcers. Early intervention and proper treatment should result in complete healing of non-ischemic diabetic foot and pressure ulcers, as defined by 100% epithelialization and no drainage (if no osteomyelitis is present). The authors developed the following paradigm, which has proved to be highly effective for complete healing of these wounds: 1) recognition that all patients with limited mobility are at risk for a sacral, ischial, trochanteric, or heel pressure ulcer; 2) daily self-examination of the sacral, ischium, buttocks, hips, and heels of all bed-bound patients and the feet of patients with diabetes with risk factors (e.g., neuropathy); 3) initiation of a treatment protocol immediately upon recognition of a break in the skin (i.e., emergence of a new wound); 4) objective measurement by planimetry of every wound (at a minimum, weekly) and documentation of its progress; 5) establishment of a moist wound-healing environment; 6) relief of pressure from the wound; 7) debridement of all non-viable tissue in the wound; 8) elimination of all drainage and cellulitis; 9) cellular therapy or growth factors for patients with wounds that do not heal rapidly after initial treatment; and 10) continuous physical and psychosocial support for all patients. If this paradigm is followed, most diabetic foot and pressure ulcers are expected to heal.","1391":"The Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) technique has been used with success in open surgery and endoscopy for hemostasis and thermal devitalisation of pathological tissue. We developed techniques and instruments for the use of this technique in Otorhinolaryngology, because of its excellent hemostatic effects and devitalising properties. APC surgery is based on a monopolar high-frequency (HF) electrical current transmitted through ionized argon gas from the tip of an applicator to the tissue surface in a contact-free mode. Indications for the use of this technique include hyperplasia of the inferior turbinate in nasal obstruction, recurrent epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, leukoplakia of the mucosa, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) of the lower airway, in combination with flexible systems. A combined technique of blunt dissection and plasma coagulation has been designed for bloodless removal of the tonsils. This new technique offers a wide variety of advantages. The limited penetration depth makes APC surgery a safe procedure; damage to neighbouring tissue can be avoided. The APC technique is a useful and comparable inexpensive method to achieve devitalisation of tissues and easy to handle hemostasis.","1392":"Multidetector computer tomography (CT) scanners permit large volumes of the body to be scanned during a single breath-hold. Post-processing of the acquired data permits thin-section anatomic reconstructions to be created. Software improvements also currently permit high-resolution reformations to be depicted in multiple planes, along with volume-rendered anatomic depiction and measurements, and fine detail of small vessels. For preoperative surgical planning in the abdomen, these technical advances permit the surgeon to make crucial decisions during the planning phases, by facilitating anatomic and, in particular, vascular depiction, tumor staging, and volumetric determinations of solid organs. This article describes the current state of CT scanning for performing image processing, and illustrates the spectrum of available imaging tools that can be used to facilitate surgical planning. Using the abdomen as a paradigm, practical uses of image processing are demonstrated for pancreas tumor staging, segmental liver resection planning, assessment and planning of liver transplantation, renal transplant donor, and renal cancer evaluation.","1393":"The introduction of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) has occurred in several surgical specialties. It allows the laparoscopic surgeon to insert a hand into the peritoneal cavity, through a small incision, while maintaining pneumoperitoneum. This technique has been made possible through the engineering of several unique devices. By returning the hand to the peritoneal cavity, the surgeon is allowed the return of tactile sensation, atraumatic retraction, blunt dissection, and digital vascular control. Proper device placement is mandatory. The principles include port-site triangulation, conversion to a convenient open incision if necessary, location away from bony prominences, and placement to minimize hand fatigue. Application and advantages of HALS can be shown in several procedures; specifically, laparoscopic splenectomy in cases of splenomegaly, laparoscopic live-donor nephrectomy, and laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for diverticular disease. Its use in these procedures does not appear to be detrimental to the benefits associated with a completely laparoscopic technique, and may offer advantages. It may alter the learning curve regarding advanced laparoscopic procedures for the neophyte laparoscopic surgeon, and allow them to perform operations they otherwise would not attempt. For the experienced laparoscopic surgeon, it may allow them to complete operations laparoscopically they might otherwise have to convert. In time, HALS may have a larger role in many advanced surgical procedures.","1394":"Postoperative nosocomial infections are associated with increased cost, hospitalization, and morbidity. S. aureus is the most common organism that contributes to postoperative nosocomial infections, and causes up to 25% of these infections. The role of the nose as a reservoir for S. aureus and possible subsequent endogenous infections has been recognized for approximately 40 years. Elimination of nasal carriage of S. aureus may be another intervention aimed at reducing postoperative infections. Mupirocin, a topical antibiotic effective against Gram-positive organisms, was proved to be effective in reducing the rates of nasal colonization of S. aureus and decreased postoperative nosocomial infections due to S. aureus.","1395":"A three-dimensional (3D) representation of laparoscopic ultrasound examinations could be helpful in diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy, but has not yet been realised with flexible laparoscopic ultrasound probes. Therefore, an electromagnetic navigation system was integrated into the tip of a conventional laparoscopic ultrasound probe. Navigated 3D laparoscopic ultrasound was compared with the imaging data of 3D navigated transcutaneous ultrasound and 3D computed tomography (CT) scan. The 3D CT scan served as the \"gold standard\". Clinical applicability in standardized operating room (OR) settings, imaging quality, diagnostic potential, and accuracy in volumetric assessment of various well-defined hepatic lesions were analyzed. Navigated 3D laparoscopic ultrasound facilitates exact definition of tumor location and margins. As compared with the \"gold standard\" of the 3D CT scans, 3D laparoscopic ultrasound has a tendency to underestimate the volume of the region of interest (ROI) (Delta3.1%). A comparison of 3D laparoscopy and transcutaneous 3D ultrasonography demonstrated clearly that the former is more accurate for volumetric assessment of the ROI and facilitates a more detailed display of the lesions. 3D laparoscopic ultrasound imaging with a navigated probe is technically feasible. The technique facilitates detailed ultrasound evaluation of laparoscopic procedures that involve visual, in-depth, and volumetric perception of complex liver pathologies. Navigated 3D laparoscopic ultrasound may have the potential to promote the practical role of laparoscopic ultrasonography, and become a valuable tool for local ablative therapy. In this article, our clinical experiences with a certified prototype of a 3D laparoscopic ultrasound probe, as well as its in vitro and in vivo evaluation, is reported.","1396":"The reproducible advantages of minimal invasive surgery have led to a worldwide spread of these techniques. Nevertheless, the increasing use of technology causes problems in the operating room (OR). The workstation environment and workflow are handicapped by a great number of isolated solutions that demand a large amount of space. The Center of Excellence in Medical Technology (CEMET) was established in 2001 as an institution for a close cooperation between users, science, and manufacturers of medical devices in the State of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The future OR, as a major project, began with a detailed process analysis, which disclosed a large number of medical devices with different interfaces and poor standardisation as main problems. Smaller and more flexible devices are necessary, as well as functional modules located outside the OR. Only actuators should be positioned near the operation area. The future OR should include a flexible-room concept and less equipment than is in use currently. A uniform human-user interface is needed to control the OR environment. This article addresses the need for a clear workspace environment, intelligent-user interfaces, and flexible-room concept to improve the potentials in use of minimal invasive surgery.","1397":"Management of severe surgical infections remains difficult and requires a multifaceted approach. In this review, we briefly summarise our approach to surgical infection, concentrating on the underlying pathological processes of intraabdominal infection. Two promising new therapies--activated protein C (ACP) and stress-dose hydrocortisone--are reviewed as adjunctive management in treatment of patients with septic shock.","1398":"Minimal invasive surgery has become the primary technique-of-choice for uncomplicated, symptomatic cholelithiasis. Skills needed for performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy cannot be extrapolated directly from the open surgical technique. An obvious need exists for a valid, objective, and repetitive teaching and training setting for minimally invasive surgery. The surgical skills laboratory may have an important role in acquisition of such skills. New technologies, such as virtual-reality surgical simulation, provide objective, trainee-friendly methods of training. Both surgeons and residents believe it is important to train residents in minimally invasive surgical techniques, using virtual-reality surgical simulation within the context of the surgical skills laboratory. This article highlights the features of one of the most promising technical novelties in the area of surgical virtual- reality simulation, the Xitact LS500 laparoscopy simulator.","1399":"Bilayered living human skin equivalent (HSE) consists of cultured keratinocytes residing on the surface of a fibroblast-populated collagen lattice. Although HSE is FDA-approved for treatment of diabetic foot and venous stasis ulcers, its clinical efficacy remains limited, because the molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effect are not fully understood. It is, therefore, often applied mistakenly as a skin graft. In this report, we delineate a mechanism of HSE biological effect and consequent optimal clinical use in accelerating closure of diabetic foot ulcers. HSE was grafted onto nude mice and the release of various growth factors was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunochemistry. Clinical: HSE was grafted onto 11 consecutive patients with diabetes who had 13 non-ischemic foot ulcers and healing was measured as time to 100% closure (e.g., no drainage and 100% epithelialized). HSE cellular components were determined to express 15 different growth factors\/cytokine genes known to promote wound healing. Histological evidence from the nude mice showed that the collagen component of HSE underwent remodeling within the first seven days of grafting. Clinical: All diabetic foot ulcers healed in 31.8   12.4 days. Local release of a unique combination of 15 growth factors expressed by HSE keratinocyte and fibroblast components generates closure of diabetic foot ulcers. HSE should be applied with the same surgical conditions for a skin graft (i.e., no cellulitis, no drainage, and negligible bacteria). We hypothesize that bilayered HSE generates its effect by way of the local synthesis and release of multiple growth factors in specific combination and concentration, which improves the impaired reparative process of chronic wounds. ","1400":"The following paper discusses a number of issues relevant to the use of topical hemostatic agents in neurosurgical\nprocedures. We initially describe the basic application of such products and review their relative\nbenefits in neurosurgical interventions, emphasizing the use of oxidized, regenerated cellulose.\nWe then discuss their role in specific operations, such as cortical debridement, cavernous sinus, and other\nskull base approaches, and aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations of the brain.","1401":"The linking of digitizing pointers to computer programs that reformat diagnostic studies has resulted in\nthe development of image-guided surgery, also called frameless stereotactic surgery. With frameless\nstereotaxy, the neurosurgeon transposes the three-dimensional physical space of the patient's skull and\ncranial contents in the operating room with the three-dimensional image space of preoperative computerized\ntomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans shown in the computer.","1402":"Vertical mammaplasty is among a group of mammaplasty procedures designed to minimize the extent\nof skin excision, and thus the potential for aesthetically unpleasing scars. However, these less traditional\ntechniques have not enjoyed the same usage as classic inverted-mammaplasties, and thus the\naccumulated experience in these techniques is less. Vertical mammaplasty can yield excellent results when\napplied appropriately, but the learning curve can be significant. Details of operative technique are presented\nalong with potential compfications, with the objective of maximizing the safety and outcome of\nvertical mammaplasty.","1403":"For the last 13 years we have been using the CO2 laser ray in plastic surgery, indicating it strictly in cases of\nrestorative surgery of cavernous hemangiomas and eventually in benign dermatologic lesions. With the\nadvent of new laser technologies, its indication extended to the resurfacing field, where results depend\non patient selectivity. In our experience, we noticed that the CO2 laser rays had poor results in attempts to\nremove tattooing and in incisions of skin and mucosa. Four years ago, we experimented with the radiofrequency\nequipment, whose mechanism of action in the tissues is very similar to that of the CO2 laser rays (cellular\nvolatilization). Following experimental studies in rats and human skin, we began to employ\nradiosugery in daily clinical practice.","1404":"Use of biomaterials as an implant device for TMJ joint reconstruction in oral maxillofacial surgery has\nbeen an ever-increasing dilemma for the oral maxillofacial surgeon. The decision to choose the best\nprocedure and device\/material in providing longevity wirh satisfaction to the patient has become a\ndemanding factor. Maxillofacial surgeons are faced with a \"young age\" patient population and are in a continual\nstruggle to find the proper device to maintain long-term survivorship without recurrent multiple\noperations. This multiple operation(s) factor can cause a further complication in itself, and also reduce the\nsurvivorship of implant devices. There has been a steady decrease in recent years in the number of TMJ surgical\nprocedures performed by accredited OMS residency training programs; this may be due to the many\nshort-term survivorship failures with certain alloplastic devices (Proplast\/Teflon and Silastic) as well as\nthe short-term survivorship of autologous tissue implants (Fascia and Grafts) and the added factor of\nenhanced complications with multiple surgeries. So the question asked by many oral maxillofacial surgeons\nis: what other procedure or biomaterial\/device, if any, is available to avert the ever-present TMJ disease\nprocess and disorder?","1405":"Craniofacial skeletal surgery continues to command special interest from patients and clinicians dealing\nwith skeletal defects. Autologous bone grafts remain the standard treatment by which bone substitutes\nare compared. A continued interest in avoiding donor sites and realizing \"off the shelf convenience\"\nhas fostered the use of biomaterial bone substitutes. The first generation of implant materials used for cranial\nreconstruction were not specifically designed for biomedical applications. Methylmethacrylate was\nadopted for cranial applications after use in implant fixation for hip arthroplasty by Charnley, The development\nof this material did not employ sophisticated implant evaluation and mainly focused on standard\nmechanical properties demonstrated on the benchtop.","1406":"This chapter focuses on techniques of posterior cervical and occipitocervical fusions. The various wiring\ntechniques described are reliable, cost-effective methods of treating cervical instability. Many of the\nestablished techniques have been modified to incorporate the use of the Songer Cable System.","1407":"The use of absorbable internal fracture fixation devices instead of conventional metallic ones abolishes\nthe need for subsequent implant removal procedures. Absorbable fracture fixation devices have been\nincreasingly used during the past decade. Approximately 150,000 patients in many countries have\nalready been treated with such implants. The vast majority of the clinically used biodegradable devices are\nmade of polyglycolide (PGA) or polylactide (PLA). The polylactide osteosynthesis devices in clinical use\ntoday usually consist of polylevolactide (PLLA). During the past decade, the assortment of implants for fracture\nfixation purposes has become broader and now includes many different kind of devices.","1408":"As of October 17, 1994,a pulsed ultrasound device has been used on a prescription basis by orthopaedic\nsurgeons in the United States (Fig. 1). The Food and Drug Administration released this device for use in\nfresh tibial diaphysis and fresh distal radial metaphysis fractures. A patient registry that records all clinical\ndata concerning both on-label and off-label prescription use of ultrasound, including other bones and different\ndurations of fracture age, has been analyzed, Table 1 summarizes the data from October 17, 1994 to July\n14, 1997. The overall healing rate was 91.6%. This includes fresh, delayed, and nonunited fractures.","1409":"In the field of osteosynthesis, biomechanical research now decisively tends towards elastic and very versatile\nfixation systems. Consequently, a progressive abandonment of the concept of rigidity as an essential\npresupposition to obtain the reduction of fractures has occurred. Furthermore, from the analysis of\nrecent studies, an exaltation of the biological potentiality of the bone tissue emerges as well as the repairing\ncapacity of this tissue if it is properly treated. Particularly in hand surgery, an absolute respect of the bone\ntissue and of the other anatomic structures is a prerequisite for a functional renewal.","1410":"Press fitting cementless porous coated acetabular components without screw fixation is desirable to minimize\ndebris-related problems. Compression between the bone and periphery of an acetabular component\nwhich is slightly larger than the reamed acetabulum provides implant fixation while oversizing at\nthe dome may adversely affect stability. In most primary total hip arthroplasties, the acetabulum can be\nreamed to a hemispherical cavity and assessed using acetabular sizing trials prior to implanting the cup. Use\nof an implant with a hemispherical dome and gradual transition to a wider peripheral dimension maximizes\nperipheral bone strains and implant stability with less impaction force and overall deformation than a larger\noversized hemispherical cup.","1411":"For years, custom hip prosthesis cemented with methyl-metacrylate has been the only alter native to traditional\ncements because of its excellent performance. Nevertheless, different complications associated with\nits use, mainly loosenings, required complex and difficult surgical revisions that greatly hindered its utility.\nNewly developed materials and cementation techniques have improved clinical and radiological outcomes\nof the cemented prosthesis. This has allowed better long-term survival, particularly among elderly patients.\nNevertheless, lifestyles of young patients still overcome the mechanical properties of the prosthesis and affects\nthe life-span of the acrylical cement used to bind it to the bone. The latter has led to the development of new\nmodels of implants that differ in its form and coatings but that still keep its metal composition.","1412":"Since 1989,the authors have used the Hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated ABG prosthesis for both primary and\nrevision hip replacement. Hydroxyapatite is osteoconductive, and therefore speeds up bone formation\nand ensures a direct contact between the implant and the host bone, without any interposed fibrous tissue.\nThe cup can thus be firmly fixed in the bony acetabulum, with eventual osseointegration into the host\nbone. The quality of the results achieved, at primary hip replacement, with bioactively coated devices has\nbeen highlighted in a large number of publications.","1413":"A femoral stem [BiContact, Aesculap, Germany) has been developed which is suitable for both cemented\nand uncemented implantation. Thus a highly standardized procedure and a standard implant for any\niritraoperative finding is available. While the cemented stems have a smooth surface, the cementless\nimplants are proximally coated with a microporous titanium plasmaspray [Plasmapore]. The strategy based on\nthe intraoperative choice of the surgeon to use either cemented or cementless implants after bone preparation\nturned out to be very successful in our institution. A consecutive series of 250 cases with cemented implantation\nand 250 cases with uncemented implantation was analyzed in a prospective follow-up study, Pollow-up time\naveraged 7 years for cemented and 6.5 years for uncemented THRs. The follow-up rate was 88.7% in cases treated\nwith cemented stems and 93.1% in cases treated with uncemented stems. The rate of aseptic loosening was 1.2%\nfor the cemented version and 0.4-% for the uncemented stem. Radiological loosening could be observed in\nanother 1.2% of the cemented stems and was not to be found in the uncemented cases. Our data suggest an\nexcellent midterm stability of both the cemented and the uncemented version of the BiContact hip system. The\nlong-term results for both the cemented and uncemented prostheses of our series are still to be evaluated.","1414":"Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women in the United\nStates. In 1997, it is estimated that 131,200 new cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed and 54,900\ndeaths will occur due to the disease. Although the tumor is localized at the time of diagnosis and resection\nwith curative intent is possible in approximately 75% of patients, more than a third will develop disease\nrecurrence. Consequently, almost half of all patients with colorectal cancer will die of metastatic disease.","1415":"For centuries, clinicians have recognized that a segment of their patient population is at increased risk to\ndevelop breast cancer based on their family history of the disease. Due to the absence of molecular\ninformation, it was not uncommon for women and their surgeons to make decisions regarding management\nof prophylactic surgery based solely on their family history, without specific information about the\npatient's personal risk to develop the disease. It has been only within the past 7 years that linkage for the\nbreast cancer (BRCA) susceptibility genes has been established, and within the past 3 years that the genes\nhave been cloned. Although clinical testing for the BRCA genes has been available for less than 2 years, it is\nalready apparent that the implications for surgeons and their patients are significant.","1416":"With the advent of advanced thoracoscopic techniques, new applications have been expanding their\nroles in thoracic surgery. The aim of this paper is to introduce our new thoracoscopic approach in\nperforming parasternal lymph node dissection of advanced breast cancer for its staging. This technique\ndoes not need the removal of any costal cartilage which is usually done in the conventional classical\ntechnique after radical mastectomy. Thoracoscopic procedure, in which wide and complete parasternal\nlymph node dissection is done, is minimally invasive and easy to perform. Therefore, the thoracoscopic technique\nmay be a suitable alternative to the conventional approach in the future.","1417":"The sharing of expensive minimally-invasive breast biopsy technology is now allowing women in small\ncities and towns in the United States to receive the same quality of care as their counterparts living near\nmajor medical centers. By placing digital stereotactic and ultrasound systems in mobile coaches, entrepreneurs\nhave filled a niche in the healthcare system which affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of\nwomen yearly.","1418":"The morbidity and mortality associated with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), as therapy\nfor benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is the impetus for the urological community's search for alternative\nmedical and surgical treatments for BPH. Interstitial Laser Coagulation of the Prostate (ILC) is a\nminimally invasive procedure usually performed to relieve symptomatic BPH, that is accomplished by\ndirecting laser energy into the gland via an implanted optical fiber using standard cystoscopic techniques.\nTreatment of adenomatous tissue with ILC reduces the size of the prostate and disrupts alpha-adrenergic\nnerve fibers.","1419":"Prevalence of symptomatic benign prostatic hypertophy (BPH) is 30% in the sixth decade of life and\napproaches 50% in the eighth decade of life. Comparable prevalence values are reported in Occidental\nand Oriental cultures, which suggests the disease susceprible to neither environmental nor cultural\nfavoritism. \"Prostatism\" is the descriptive word for the BPH constellation of symptoms, which appear as a\nresult of bladder outlets obstructed by an enlarged prostate. In traditional prostatism, prostate growth has a\nbenign etiology. These urologie symptoms may be either irritative (difficulty postponing urination, frequent\nawakenings at night for urination), obstructive (weak stream, hesitancy), or both. In the context of so much\nmorbidity associated with the BPH symptom complex, this disease is arguably the most bothersome disease\nfor the elderly male. With improvements in healthcare, and with men having longer life expectancies, there\nis the appreciation of an expanded patient population. It has become possible to heat the prostate with\nradiofrequency energy (RF) to relieve symptoms associated with BPH using a heating technique called\n\"transurethral needle ablation of the prostate\" (TUNA). By both subjective and objective criteria, TUNA theraphy\nto the prostate for BPH compares favorably with traditional surgical treatment. Now the durability of\nthe TUNA treatment is demonstrated beyond three years.","1420":"At both laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, controlled movement of fluids is necessary. In addition, at\nlaparoscopy, suctioning of accumulated smoke from lasers or electrosurgery is an essential venting\ntechnique to enhance visibility. This chapter will describe and discuss a unique, simple, cost-effective\nsystem that can be used for both hysteroscopy and laparoscopy to accomplish movement of fluids and management\nof smoke. Aquadissection or hydrodissection has been used for many years as an adjuvant to operative\nlaparoscopy.' It has been found useful for operative laparoscopic treatment of conditions such as\nendometriosis, pelvic adhesions, and tubal obstructron. Most current systems are cumbersome, wastefully\nuse large volumes of fluid, and often require a mechanical pump for pressurizing the fluid suction and irrigation\nsystems. Usually, during combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, a separate system is used for\naccomplishing uterine distention when fluids are used for the hysteroscopic portion of surgery. The\nPump Vac Plus can be used for both hysteroscopic distention and laparoscopic suction and irrigation. This\narticle will describe our techniques for using the Pump Vac for both of these endoscopic approaches.","1421":"Ultrasonic Surgical Aspiration (USA) is a technique which employs a hand-held instrument that selectively\nfragments and aspirates tissues of high-water content. The selectivity of the device permits\npreservation of underlying vital structures while the aspiration provides a tissue specimen for histologic\nanalysis. Application of this device to neoplastic disease of the lower genital tract has been reported to\nprovide durable success rates of 78% for conyloma acuminata and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and\n81% for vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN).Employment of USA in patients with advanced ovarian cancer\nhas been shown to improve surgical cytoreduction without increasing blood loss or complication rates.","1422":null,"1423":"Pelvic adhesions observed in gynecologic patients are a major contributing factor to infertility, pelvic\npain, and\/or intestinal obstruction.

This technique has been proved effective and safe especially in removing\nchocolate-like cystoma. This new instrument, which we originally designed, has two balloons at the\ntip of the catheter. After a cyst is punctured, the inner and outer balloons are inflated to fix the cyst well.\nAfter fixing the cyst with two balloons, the internal needle of the instrument can be removed. This catheter,\nnamed the SAND balloon catheter, is advantageous in laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy.","1425":"The efficacy of medical therapy in endometriosis-associated infertility has been called into question.\nFor decades, surgery has been used in the treatment of endometriosis. However, before the 1960s it consisted\nof either excision or hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy. Although controversy exists about\nwhether laparotomy or operative laparoscopy is the more efTective therapeutic approach for endometriosis,\nthe efficacy of surgery in reducing implants, relieving dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain, and improving fertility\nhas been well-established.","1426":"Interrupting the venous return from below the diaphragm is usually associated with sudden hypotension,\nhypovolemic cardiac failure, and increased bleeding secondary to acute venous hypertension and hepatic\ncongestion. Shaw, Starzl, and Griffith developed a veno-veno bypass technique to shunt the somatic and\nsplanchnic venous return around the retrohepatic vena cava to the superior vena cava. This permitted continuation\nof venous return and simultaneous blood warming, allowing surgeons to perform complex procedures in\na dry operative field. These bypass techniques have evolved since their introduction in the 1980s and are now\nbeing applied for the removal of otherwise nonresectable tumors of the liver, adrenal gland, and kidney.\nFurther, traumatic injuries to the hepatic veins and the retrohepatic cava associated with a high mortality rate\ncan be repaired safely using vascular isolation techniques and bypass.","1427":"Cardiac surgery is currently performed on 800,000 patients each year worldwide. Complications involving\nthe central nervous system account for the major adverse sequelae of the procedure and are\nincreasing substantially as more elderly patients are undergoing surgery. Strokes occur in 5% of\npatients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and in as many as 13% of patients undergoing\nopen heart surgery. Neuropsychologic impairment occurs more commonly and is persistent in 35% of\npatients 1 year after surgery.","1428":"The advancements in cardiac valvular replacement devices over the past 25 years have left residual problems with biological and mechanical prostheses. The extensive developments were introduced to reduce or eliminate valve-related complications, namely thromboembolism, anticoagulant-related hemorrhage, and structural failure, as weil as to optimize hemodynamic performance. Residual problems persist with both biological and mechanical prostheses. Structural failure of porcine and pericardial bioprostheses persists over time with leaflet degeneration and dystrophic calcification. Thrombus formation from blood stasis and the resultant thromboembolic phenomena despite anticoagulant management remain a continuing problem with mechanical prostheses. The innovative  echnologies under investigation will likely significantly improve the clinical performance of both biological and mechanical prostheses.","1429":"Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) has been an established technique for the treatment of severe\ncoronary artery disease for more than 20 years and is one of the most frequently performed surgical\nprocedures in industrialized countries. Continuous technical and pharmacologic refinements in perioperative\nmanagement, including advances in anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) techniques\n(i.e., stop ping the heart and using a heart\/lung pump to keep the blood flowing through the body) have\nimproved the results of coronary surgery. However, the trade-off for such advancements is often increased\ncosts and resource utilization. While the results or outcomes of inhospital mortality and morbidity have\nreached a plateau, an increasing number of \"high-risk\" patients are being considered for procedures that\nwere previously contraindicated in their situations. Therefore, innovations for alternative methods of surgical\nmyocardial revascularization continue to develop, with the aim of both improving the results of coronary\nsurgery and reducing the use of healthcare resources.","1430":"Repair of the recurrent groin hernia remains one of the more perplexing problems encountered by the\ngeneral surgeon. Surgical results have shown little improvement in the more than 100 years of modern\nhernia surgery.

In addition to these applications, phantoms\nare available to enhance the learning process in echografical skills in general.","1440":"In recent years, we have seen minimally invasive surgery used for a number of procedures once thought\nimprobable if not impossible. Increased technical skills and improved instrumentation have broken down\nmany of the early barriers to performing minimally invasive liver surgery. Improvements in imaging technologies,\nparticularly videoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound, have made laparoscopy the gold standard for\nassessment of liver pathology. Instruments and approaches for more advanced hepatic procedures (resections,\ntumor ablations) are currently being developed and refined.","1441":"Thoracoscopic sympathectomy was first described in 1951 but was not popularized until this decade.\nWith the advent of videoendoscopic techniques and advances in minimally invasive surgery, thoracoscopic\nsympathectomy has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in the treatment of various\nautonomically mediated disorders. Furthermore, numerous investigators have reported high rates of technical\nsuccess and patient satisfacrion. These minimally invasive techniques used to resect the sympathetic\nganglia significantly reduces the morbidity and mortality often associated with conventional open procedures.\nIn addition, endoscopic techniques provide a magnified view of the surgical field and allow for precise\nidentification of the sympathetic chain and points of resection.","1442":"The preoperative diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum in adults is uncommon, and even more infrequent is\nthe presentation of a bleeding Meckel's diverticulum after childhood. The case of a 22-year old, otherwise\nhealthy male is presented here. The diagnosis was made by barium examination of small bowel and\nconfirmed by diagnostic laparoscopy, followed by complete laparoscopic resection using an Endo-GIA\nStapler (United States Surgical Corp., Norwalk, Conn.]. Histopathological examination of the specimen\nshowed inflammed ileal mucosa with hemorrhages in several foci. The literature of Meckel's diverticula and\nits complications are reviewed here. Based on data from the reviewed literature and our own experience, we\nsuggest that laparoscopic resection is the treatment of choice for Meckel's diverticulum, if it is diagnosed\npreoperatively or during diagnostic laparoscopy. The procedure allows for a smooth postoperative course,\nearly discharge from the hospital, and arapid return to normal activity.","1443":"Traditionally, inguinal hernia repair uses autogenous tissues (Shouldice, Bassini, Cooper's). While dedicated\nhernia clinics have shown low recurrence rates using autogenous tissues, most studies show\nrecurrence rates in the 5% to 15% range. In addition, these tension producing repairs may lead to a\nlonger recovery due to increased discomfort. For these reasons, the recent trend in inguinal hernia\nsurgery has been towards using a mesh-based tensionless repair. There are three main tension-free\napproaches using mesh that are presently receiving the majority of attention:","1444":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common foregut disorder, with 7% of Americans\nexperiencing heartburn daily. Symptoms of GERD are many and varied, including heartburn, chest\npain, regurgitation, dysphagia, nocturnal aspiration, morning hoarseness, chronic cough, and wheezing.\nFifty percent of symptomatic patients develop esophagitis, while 20% of patients with esophagitis\ndevelop complications, including ulceration, stricture, Barrett's esophagus, and aspiration pneumorritis.","1445":"Minimally invasive surgery has become the dominant surgical procedure for cholecystectomy and many\ngynecological procedures. It is also gaining ground over the conventional procedures of herniorrhaphe,\nappendectomy. pelvic lymph node dissections, colectomies. lysis of adhesions, abdominal\nexplorations, spleenectomy as well as thoracic, vascular and coronary bypass, and cardiac procedures.","1446":"Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States according to C. Everett\nKoop, M.D., former Surgeon General of the United States. The use of tobacco is the leading cause, but\nin the near future, obesity will become the first. Estimates of the percentage of adult Americans who\nare overweight range from 35% to 50%. Those who are morbidly obese (100 pounds or more overweight),\nnumber approximately 8 million. There is no doubt that obesity is a significant public health problem,\nparticularly when its comorbidities are considered: diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal\nreflux, cardiovascular disease, degenerative arthritis, cholelithiasis, respiratory insufficiency,\ncancer, sleep apnea, and many others. Serious medical problems are usually present in patients with morbid\nobesity. When significant long-term weight loss is accomplished for these patients, the comorbidities\nalmost always improve or disappear entirely.","1447":"","1448":"","1449":"The human hand-arm system provides seven degrees of freedom for the manipulation of objects in space.\nIn open surgery these motion axes can be used fully when guiding the surgical instrument. In endoscopic\nprocedures the surgical instrument is fixed to the point of trocar insertion, resulting in only four\ndegrees of freedom. This leads to a loss of instrumental functionality in endoscopic procedures. Robotics\nand telemanipulator technology can be used to restore the full spatial mobility of the endoscopic instrument.\nA functional model of an endoscopic master-slave manipulator system has been developed and is\nunder experimental surgical evaluation. Allied technologies include new tactile sensor and vision systems\nthat can enhance the application of robotic systems in surgery for the future.","1450":"Primary and secondary malignant disease of the liver remains a major health problem in the United States\nand abroad. It is estimated that over 130,000 new cases and 55,000 deaths will result from colorectal carcinoma\nin 1997. In this same year, 13,600 new cases and 12,400 deaths are also expected to result from primary\nhepatic tumors. Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma results in approximately 250,000 deaths yearly.","1451":"Surgical patients are often treated with vitamins, such as vitamin C, postoperatively. Many surgical patients may have been depleted of essential nutrients through poor diet, debilitation, lack of adequate oral nutrition, or other effects of prolonged hospitalization. Vitamins are essential cofactors in many of the normal wound healing processes. Furthermore, vitamin therapy is thought to carry no risk of harm. While this is generally true, oversupplementation with vitamin C can increase the risk of oxalosis in patients who are predisposed.","1452":"","1453":"Today,s healthcare facilities face many challenges, two of which are the management of bloodborne\npathogen exposures and staff training. Despite new advances and the best efforts of dedicated staff, little\nprogress has been made toward resolving these problems.","1454":"Phenomenal progress has occurred in the art of liver resection. Only a decade ago massive blood transfusion,\nliver failure, bile leak, or sepsis were alI frequent attendants of major resection, and intraoperative\ndeath from torrential bleeding from hepatic veins or vena cava was not uncommon. Now, major liver\nresection may be accomplished routinely without blood transfusion, and operative mortality of 0% to 2% is\nstandard in expert hands. Uncontrolled hemorrhage remains the primary cause of intraoperative death.\nMortality in the early postoperative period is usually related to delayed hemorrhage, inadequate hepatic\nreserve, or injury to vital blood supply or biliary drainage in the liver remnant.","1455":"Natural rubber latex (NRL) has been exploited commercially for more than 100 years. It is derived from\nthe milky sap of the Hevea brasiliensis tree, found in tropical climates such as Southeast Asia. Latex is\nharvested from the tree by a process called tapping, which has been described as a controlled wounding\nof the tree. The world's total consumption of natural rubber latex is about 5,5 million tons per year. The\nliquid which is collected from the tree is called field latex and is made up of water, 30%to 40% rubber, and\nabout 3% nonrubber material.","1456":"Recent improvements in surgical techniques and procedures have been accompanied by attempts to\ndevelop adhesives to seal wounds. In the 1940s, Young et al., in animal studies, attempted to connect\nnervous tissue with a fibrin adhesive, however, as separation and purification of blood constituents\nwere still in a primitive state, their efforts did not progress to clinical usage.","1457":"The need to create a new kind of operating room (OR) is obvious from the situation today. Although a\nnumber of innovative and even futuristic OR concepts have been proposed, the challenge to implement\nthe OR of the future has never been met. In the Integrated OR System project we came to the conclusion\nthat we have to proceed to new values and new approaches to make the OR of the next millennium\nhappen. By following those new roads we will not only overcome the deficiencies of the OR today but also\ncreate a platform that allows easy inclusion of upcoming technology.","1458":"Open spinal discectomy, at times with spinal fusion, is associated with significant local morbidity and long-term convalescence, requires general anesthesia, and involves dissection of muscle, removal of bone, ligament and disc, which are all at greater financial cost. Therefore, the search for a less traumatic spinal discectomy began, including micro-discectomy, and percutaneous techniques and endoscopic discectomy. Lyman Smith reported intradiscal injection of chymopapain in 1964. Onik et al. developed the automated percutaneous discectomy device for continuous aspiration\/irrigation of disc tissue in 1985. Hijikata et al also described nucleotomy independently in 1985. In 1986, Ascher and Choy first reported laser discectomy to decrease intradiscal pressure.","1459":null,"1460":"In the long-term performance ofthe temporomaridibular joint (TMJ) implant, wear must be considered. Thus retrieved and laboratory test implants were examined both optically and in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In laboratory testing, the volumetric wear of metal-on-metal was about an order of magnitude less than that of acrylic-on-metal TMJ implants. This metal-on-metal wear was also about half of that reported in the literature for a laboratory test of polyethylene-on-metal TMJ implants, The retrieved TMJ implants showed some abrasive wear occurred during multi-directional articulation with smaller wear zones for the metal-on-metal compared to the acrylic-on-metal configuration. Further efforts to characterize and minimize wear were recommended as prudent in the continuing development of TMJ arthroplasty.","1461":"Intestinal transplantation is no longer an experimental procedure and is the treatment of choice for patients with irreversible intestinal failure that cannot be maintained on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The intestine was a forbidden organ to be transplanted in humans until the 1980s due to its rich lymphoid content that precipitates either host-versus-graft or graft-versus-host alloreactivity.","1462":"Pituitary adenomas are slow growing, benign lesions originating from various hormone producing cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The currently used morphofunctional classification is based on histology, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Pituitary adenomas may present clinically with certain endocrinopathies attributable to pituitary hypersecretion of pituitary hormones, or with neurologic symptoms of tumor mass effect due to compression of the adjacent brain structures, such as optic or other cranial nerves, and may induce increased intracranial pressure.","1463":"Evaluation of the prognosis of patients with breast cancer is criticai in determining post-surgical adjuvant therapy because of great heterogeneity in response to the therapy, At present, the decision-making for adjuvant therapy largely depends on histologic nodal status, but a significant number of patients without nodal involvement undergo relapse. Although great efforts have been made for more accurate and potent factors, significant indicators have not yet been found. One of the promising candidates, however, is histologic angiogenesis in tumors, which we and others have indicated as an independent prognostic factor in node-negative subset by the multivariate analysis. Here we will evaluate several prognostic factors in clinical use.","1464":"The meniscus arrow is a T-shaped fastener that provides an \"all inside\" technique for repair of longitudinal meniscal tears in the vascular zone through arthroscopic portals. No posterior incisions are needed and there are no sutures to tie. The arrow is made of proprietary self-reinforced polylactic acid and is rigid enough to allow impaction across a torn meniscus. The design allows the \"T\" of the head to be driven into and hold onto the surface of the meniscus, while the shaft, with its \"fish hook\" barbs, crosses the tear to fix to the periphery. The arrows begin to degrade in 4 to 6 months and are absorbed in 18 to 24 months.","1465":"In the 1930s, Mixter and Barr reported their results with laminectomy and discectomy, setting forth the concept that radicular pain is associated with disc herniation. Since then, investigators have attempted to findalternatives to laminectomy and discectomy to enhance operative efficacy and decrease postoperative complications such as destabilizing and scarring the spinal canal. The trend has been toward minimizing the invasiveness of procedures that currently includes microdiscectomy and percutaneous procedures.","1466":"The advent of the arthroscope has revolutionized orthopaedic surgery, particularly for injuries to the knee or shoulder. The enhanced visualization accompanied by minimal soft tissue injury afforded by the arthroscope has been applied successfully to the treatment of many shoulder girdie pathologies, most notably impingement syndrome and rotator cuff injuries. As such, the traditional open surgery with the incumbent morbidity, while still utilized for more complex tears is finding less application in smaller tears to the rotator cuff. This review will address the history, indications, technique, and results of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.","1467":"The incidence of glenohumeral joint instability is estimated to effect between 2 and 8% of the population. It represents at least one third of all shoulder related emergency room visits. When one considers the spectrum of shoulder instability, including transient subluxation, the true incidence of glenohumeral instability is probably grossly under-reported. Although any age group can be affected, shoulder instability is primarily a disease of the young. The occurrence of instability is inversely proportional to the age of the patient and the time of original injury. A patient who dislocates for the first time as a teen can expect a redislocation rate approaching 90% in his or her lifetime. Therefore, many authors recommend early surgical treatment to repair the lesion.","1468":"A chondral\/osteochondral defect involving the articular surface of a joint is still a therapeutic problem. The goal of articular cartilage repair is restoration of cartilage congruity, accomplishing a full pain free range of motion and elimination of cartilage deterioration. Current treatment modalities include debridement and drilling, picking or abrasion of the subchondral bone, fresh osteochondral allografts, periosteal or perichondral grafting, periosteal grafting with chondrocyte transplant, and joint replacement. The use of autologous grafts was first repor ted in 1964.","1469":"Conservative-functional treatment of fresh humeral shaft fractures remains the method of choice, even though operative stabilization is increasingly being considered as an alternative. Among the surgical options, humeral nailing becomes more and more popular. Different humeral nail systems have been introduced for antegrade implantation. Many of them are criticized as problematic, or even insufficient, because of difficulties in implantation, damage of the humeral head cartilage, shoulder impingement, or rotatory instability.","1470":"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major cause of death in a hospitalized population, In North America, there are about 260,000 cases of clinically recognized venous thromboembolism (VTE) each year with an in-hospital case fatality rate of 12%. Considering the difficulties of making an accurate diagnosis in this commonly silent disease, there may be as many as 600,000 clinically significant cases per year.","1471":"The etiology of surgical failure should be defined before revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is contemplated, since revision surgery without a clear reason may fail to correct the underlying problem. The causes of mechanical failure include component loosening, instability, polyethylene wear, component malposition, extensor mechanism dysfunction, and loss of motion. Revision that is required because of an infection is also acomplex situation, which requires skill and meticulous technique in order to restore a functional outcome. A successful revision needs to account for ligamentous balance, bone loss, alignment, and fixation.","1472":"More than 30 years ago John Charnley and others created total hip replacement. The problems they faced were formidable. Two major problems dominated the scene: namely fixation and wear. Fifty years ago Austin Moore devised a new replacement for aged patients with fractured neck of the femora, but he did not achieve total fixation, nor was this necessary in the ambience of the patient's functional demands.","1473":"For more than 30 years central venous catheterization has provided an important means of long-term vascular access and circulatory monitoring. Thrombosis of central veins is one of the serious complications of this procedure, The reported incidence of thrombosis varies and it is often underestimated clinicaIly due to the pau city of signs and symptoms. Symptomatic subelavian vein thrombosis is estimated to occur in up to 15% of patients with indwelling venous access devices.","1474":"Superficial thrombophlebitis (SVT)is a common disorder with potential morbidity from recurrence and pulmonary embolism (PE), but it has received little attention in the literature. The availability of reliable duplex ultrasonography of the deep and superficial venous systems has made routine determination of the location and incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in association with SVT practical.","1475":"Over the past few years, the concept of \"minimally invasive surgery\" has generated a significant interest in the field of cardiovascular surgery. Congenital heart diseases such as patent ductus arteriosus, vascular ring or atrial septal defect have been treated using video-assisted technology. Although patients have undergone mitral valve replacement and repair, the focus of interest in the development of video-assisted cardiac surgery is in the treatment of coronary artery disease.","1476":"The introduction and widespread acceptance of minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized surgical practice in many disciplines over the last two decades. Endoscopic operations have been shown to reduce patient morbidity and provide a more rapid return to work. Until recently, endoscopic approaches have had little impact on the field of cardiac surgery. Endoscopically-sutured coronary anastomoses have not been possible with conventional endoscopic instruments, due in part to their length and imprecision.","1477":"A trend towards less invasive operations has affected the surgical specialties for the past 10 years. Cardiac surgery had been the slowest subspeciaIty to move in this direction, but in 1995 enthusiasm for \"minimally invasive\" cardiac operations began to grow. Since the initial report by Acuff published in 1996, minimally invasive coronary bypass surgery has developed and undergone a tremendous evolution resulting in the now mature minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) operation, as well as the still evolving off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) procedure. The success of MIDCAB has led surgeons to look at past procedures to help develop future multivessel coronary operations.","1478":"In 1910, Professor H. C. Jacobaeus first described thoracoscopy. He used a modified cystoscope to inspect the pleural cavity. He described his two cannula techniques, one for the light source, and the other for viewing. Later on, the technique was improved, and a single cannula provided the light source and an optic telescope. With the advent of video assisted thoracoscopy, the procedure has gone full circle; once again, two cannulae are used - one to give us a video assisted telescopic picture and the second cannula is used for operational purposes.","1479":"Uterine fibroids are common benign tumors of the uterus and a major public health problem. Between 20 and 25% of women over 35 years of age are estimated to have fibroids. Three subtypes of fibroids are recognized depending on their relationship to the myometrium, namely, submucosal, subserosal and intramural. Fibroids are frequently asymptomatic, but may be associated with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, pregnancy loss or infertility. They are composed predominantly of smooth muscle, with a variable amount of connective tissue, and they have a characteristic smooth white whorled appearance on cross sectional examination.","1480":"The first description of the laparoscopic approach to colorectal cancer resection was in 1991. Today, the exact role of laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery remains undefined and awaits the results of multicenter randomized controlled trials. Most authors agree that pending these results, such surgery should be performed only in specialist centers and on study populations. This hesitant adoption of the laparoscopic modality in colorectal cancer surgery is in stark contrast to the speed and enthusiasm with which laparoscopic cholecystectomy was adopted without a randomized controlled trial. Adapting laparoscopic techniques to malignant disease requires confirmation that the laparoscopic approach conforms to the principles of surgical oncology: adequacy of resection margins, wide clearance of lymph nodes fields, and the avoidance of iatrogenic tumor dissemination.","1481":"The incidence of rectal cancer in the US is 45,000 per ann um. The 5-year survival is between 40 and 70%. This has not improved over the last 50 years despite improvements in techniques, the aid of new technology (surgical stapling devices in particular) and safer anesthesia.","1482":"In 1942,Hughes performed the first thoracoscopic removal of sympathetic ganglia. Two years later Goetz and Marr reported on cases that had undergone thoracoscopic sympathectomy. In the 1950s, Kux performed more than 1,400 thoracoscopic sympathectomies and vagotomies. Interest in thoracoscopic sympathectomy increased in the 1980s and now it is the treatment of choice for severe axillary and palmar hyperhidrosis.","1483":"Acute pancreatitis is a disease with a significant morbidity and mortality. It has been reported as the principal diagnosis in 2% of hospital admissions with abdominal pain in the UK. The incidence is in the range of 200 to 300 cases per million population per year, but it is probably increasing. The overall mortality rate is 10 to 12%. The management of the disease and its complications requires close co-operation between surgeon, radiologist and gastroenterologist. There have been a number of improvements in the management of acute pancreatitis in the last decade.","1484":"Repair of incisional herniae by direct approximation of the edges is associated with high incidence of recurrence. Tension free repair with prosthetic material was an advance in decreasing the incidence of recurrence. Repair with prosthetic material, to be successful, re qui res extensive dissection and its associated complications. Advances in laparoscopy along with the improvements in prosthetic materials has opened up opportunity for further decreasing the incidence of recurrence with minimal dissection.","1485":"The process of unraveling small bowel pathology by endoscopic means may be the last frontier for gastroenterologists. When the source of blood loss remains obscure after upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, small intestinal pathology becomes a considerarion. Traditionally, the 3 m of small bowel have been examined with contrast and nuclear radiology with discouraging results. Barium, smallbowel follow through x-rays have low yield. Enteroclysis is a radiographic technique using contrast and careful examination with a 10 to 25% diagnostic yield in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Nuclear bleeding scans and angiography have reported varying degrees of success.","1486":"The impact of adequate nutrition on wound healing, immunity and patient morbidity has been ap preciated since the early work of Stanley Dudrik in the late 60s and early 70s. Although total parenteral nutrition improved the outcome in nutritionally debilitated patients, it often led to overwhelming infections in these immunologically sensitive patients. In the 90s, the importance of gut as an endocrine and immune organ has been well established, as weU as the superiority of enteral feeding over parenteral nutrition, in most cases. Here we discuss the available techniques for accessing the gastrointestinal tract as well as the guidelines for selection of patients.","1487":"The advent of volumetric helical computed tomography (CT), coupled with the almost universal use of oral and intravenous contrast agents, has resulted in CT becoming the diagnostic and therapeutic cornerstone for alimentary tract disease. Recent technical advances, further enhanced by innovative software developments, now permit multiplanar and endoluminal projections of the entire abdomen, and have resulted in the development of novel diagnostic applications in the abdomen.","1488":"The minimally invasive direct access surgical technology (MIDAST) has grown out of previous experience applied in otolaryngology and endoscopic microsurgery. From the time of Ambroise Pare and for centuries surgeons have made large incisions to gain adequate access for manipulation with large, straight, bulky instruments and achieved adequate illumination by the sun and later by artificial lighting.","1489":"Laparoscopic hepatic cryotherapy, using intraoperative ultrasound monitoring, was introduced in the 1980s by Onik who combined the freezing process with intraoperative ultrasound for monitoring the extent of freezing. The results of open cryotherapy of the liver have been reported for more than 900 patients, the majority having received cryotherapy for liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. While data on the long-term outcome of patients treated with cryotherapy are limited, some authors have documented survival comparable to that for hepatic resecrion. This is remarkable, considering these patients are often deemed unresectable and most do not even survive 1 year.","1490":"Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) of the intra- and extrabepatic biliary system is being used with increased frequency in many medical centers. The value of IOUS in facilitating surgery in patients with complicated diseases of the gallbladder or with stones in the bile ducts is well recognized. However, a variety of less common diseases affect the intrahepatic ducts, many of which require sophisticated surgical techniques when resection is being undertaken. In many situations, these operations can be facilitated by the use of IOUS, both for depicting segmental and ductal anatomy, and in guiding resections and anastomoses. This report summarizes the techniques currently used for performing IOUS of the biliary system, and illustrates the spectrum of clinical applications that may require IOUS guidance.","1491":"Totally extraperitoneal herniorrhaphy (TEP) is a highly technical procedure with a long learning curve for surgeons. It demands extra skills and may be frustrating, even to the experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The main eriticisms have been the higher costs, the need for general anesthesia, and the prolonged operating room time. When properly performed, TEP provides satisfaction to all involved, namely the patient, the surgeon and the third party payer. The initial concerns of safety, efficacy and efficiency are no longer valid issues as TEP has proved to be safe in numerous randomized trials. We find that there is increasing patient demand for this procedure.","1492":"Image guided surgery can be defined as the intraoperative use of a radiologicai technique to give the surgeon information not available from direct inspection or palpation of the surgical field. This information may then be used to change the course of an operative procedure. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has the potential to be the most useful radiologicai technique in the developing field of image guided surgery.","1493":"Therapeutic laparoscopy has developed rapidly since the first report of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1986. Several other reports followed before the end of that decade. Recent developments have resulted from a combination of the many technical improvements in laparoscopic equipment, together with the innovation and increasing experience of those performing laparoscopic surgery. Cholecystectomy, appendectomy, gastric fundoplication, and preperitoneal hernia repair are all now widely practiced and often laparoscopy is the favored approach.","1494":"Glove powders are used by manufacturers of latex and synthetic surgical gloves to assist with the stripping of gloves from their molds, facilitate donning, and absorb moisture during use. Corn starch powders have replaced the originally used tale powder because of the induction of patient complications with the older preparations, However, recent research indicates that patient exposure to starch based powders during surgery may also cause problems. The frequency, variety, and severity of complications suggest that powder free alternatives be considered in the perioperative environment.","1495":"Rapid advancements in technology have dramatically changed the way our daily activities are conducted. In the practice of medicine and surgery, technological advances over the past few decades have had an enormous impact on the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In contrast, our methods of teaching surgeons to perform operations remain mired in the 100 year old Halstedian apprenticeship model. In this system, surgeons often learn to operate based on the principle of \"see one, do one, teach one.\" Educational opportunities are largely dependent on chance as a patient with a particular disease pattern must present to the surgeon in order to achieve specific educational goals. Live patients are often used as the initial \"practice session\" for the learning surgeon in this model of education.","1496":"The problem of resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics is not new, but in the past few years the development of resistance in common pathogens has heightened awareness and coverage in the lay press, as well as influential general scientific and medical journals. This has alerted public attention to the problem.","1497":"In the last 10 years there has been an increased awareness of the need for improved pain management, especially in the postoperative period, to a large extent stimulated by the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), which published its clinical practice guidelineS for pain management in 1992. Teams of surgeons, nurses and anesthesiologists now are combining modalities for managing pain so as to provide the most comfortable postoperative course possible for their patients.","1498":"At one time, the US Government's health technology assessment programs [i,e., the evaluation of drugs, devices, and procedures used in health care for their safety, effectiveness, cost, and social implications) were models for both the public and private sector agencies and for the rest of the world. This time is no more. Three years has passed since the most prominent technology assessment program in this country, if not the world, was terminated by the US Congress.","1499":null,"1500":"","1501":"","1502":"Subperiosteal rejuvenation of the forehead may be performed through several small incisions in the brow. Small incisions are placed in the hairline and within the hair-bearing portion of the brow. The procedure provides a safe and reliable way to improve the position of the brow. The addition of resorbable screw fixation improves the stability of the brow position postoperatively and facilitates healing in the desired location. Subperiosteal brow lift may be performed successfully by way of minimally invasive incisions with favorable results.","1503":"Disc displacements develop from alterations in the structural integrity of the condyle-disc complex. A definitive treatment that may be considered for such derangements is surgical correction. The goal of surgery is to return the disc to normal functional relationship with the condyle, or replace the disc with an alloplast. Surgery, is, therefore, considered when conservative therapy fails to adequately resolve the symptoms, progression of the disorder occurs, or both.","1504":"Spinal surgeons have long sought to find a procedure of choice by which to treat thoracic disc herniations. The threat of cord injury has stimulated many attempted approaches including posterior laminectomy (abandoned currently as too likely to result in neurologic loss), costotransversectomy, trans-thoracic trans-pleural, postero-lateral, trans-pedicular and, more recently, transthoracic endoscopic. Commonly, surgery is not contemplated unless significant cord compression and neurologic deficit is present.","1505":"Bone grafts are used in musculoskeletal surgery to restore structural integrity and enhance osteogenic potential. The demand for bone graft for skeletal reconstruction in bone tumor, revision arthroplasty, and trauma surgery, couple with recent advances in understanding and application of the biology of bone transplantation, has resulted in an exponential increase in the number of bone-grafting procedures performed over the last decade. It is estimated that 1.5 million bone-grafting procedures are currently performed worldwide each year, compared to a fraction of that number 20 years ago. Major developments also have resulted in the harvesting, storage, and use of bone grafts and production of graft derivatives, substitutes, and bone-inducing agents.","1506":"Symptomatic chondral lesions in the knee remain a problem for young sportsmen and pose a difficult management issue for orthopedic surgeons and patients alike. Damaged articular cartilage has a limited potential for healing and can lead to premature arthritis. Articular defects larger than 2 mm to 4 mm in diameter rarely heal. Neither articular cartilage possesses a lymphatic drainage, a sufficient blood supply, nor neural elements. Also, they are sheltered even from immunological recognition, because of the extracellular matrix surrounding the chondrocyte.","1507":"Venous and arterial thromboses account for some of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality amongst patients in the United States and many other Western societies. Clotting disorders and hypercoagulable states are no longer just treated by hematologist, but by multiple specialties including internal medicine, family practice, critical care physicians and most recently, hospitalists. In more than 75% of cases, the cause of the thrombotic episodes can be identified. More than one-half of the patients with thrombosis harbor either congenital propensity to develop a thrombosis, or have an acquired event that precipitates a pro-thrombotic state.","1508":"In our department, all the patients over 65 years of age with a displaced intracapsular fracture of the upper femur (type III and IV of the Garden's classification) are treated with a femoral hemiarthroplasty (Figs. 1a &amp; 1b). This practice is relatively universal among the European traumatologic centers. Two prospective and randomized trials, published in 2000, reported a high rate of reoperation when treating these fractures with osteosynthesis (36% and 38% of the cases), thus indicating arthroplasty may be preferred.","1509":"Thrombosis is a common cause of death in the United States. More than two million people die each year from an arterial or venous thrombosis, or the consequences thereof. Approximately an equal number suffer non-fatal thrombosis; for example, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), non-fatal pulmonary embolus (PE), non-fatal cerebrovascular thrombosis (CVT), transient cerebral ischemic attacks (40% of these have a fatal or non-fatal CVT within one year), non-fatal coronary artery thrombosis, retinal vascular thrombosis (RVT), and other non-fatal thrombotic deaths. These numbers emphasize the scope of the problem. By contrast, approximately 550,000 people will die this year in the United States from cancer; thus, fatal thrombosis is approximately four times as prevalent as fatality from malignancy. Thrombosis, therefore, accounts for extraordinary morbidity, mortality, and cost of medical care.","1510":"Fractures of the femoral neck are frequent in the elderly population. The reduced general health status and presence of concomitant diseases, in many cases, make the treatment of these patients demanding. Early mobilization is mandatory to avoid secondary infections, which were often lethal in the past. Surgical intervention has become the standard treatment for these patients. Only a few patients with stable fracture-types allow early mobilization without operation.","1511":"As the population ages, primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) is becoming one of the most common orthopedic procedures. Therefore, revisions for mechanical loosening after THA should also increase in future years. Loosening is a progressive phenomenon that, along with intracortical granuloma, causes bone destruction. The main concern in total hip revision surgery is the reduced bone stock, which makes it difficult to obtain optimal stability of the femoral stem (Case 1: Figs. 1 a, b).","1512":"Articles in the literature about hydroxyapatite-coated hip prostheses show both the clinical and radiological results are extremely satisfactory in the short and medium term. They bear out the reliability, constancy, and durability of bio-active fixation. As in the case of cemented prostheses, results are tempered by the emergence of complications linked with the particles produced by polyethylene wear, a particular cause of osteolysis in the femur or acetabulum. The ABG II HA hip prosthesis was designed with the aim of reducing this type of complication while maintaining the principle of bio-active fixation. Implantation of the system is subject to certain requirements; in particular, a preoperative radiologic assessment is required and the surgical technique must be strictly followed to optimize the biomechanical functioning of the implanted hip.","1513":"Patients with 75 TRAC (Biomet, Inc., Warsaw, IN) knees have been observed for one year with the following results: average flexion 117 degrees, HSS score 88.4, Knee Society scores 92.2 (knee), and 76.8 (function). Early results of the TRAC knee appear promising.","1514":"In prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical studies, pulsed, low-intensity ultrasound has been proven to be effective in decreasing the time to heal in both fresh diaphyseal (tibia) and metaphyseal (distal radius) fractures. It also decreases the likelihood of a delayed union (&gt;150 days to heal) in tibia fractures and loss of reduction in distal radius fractures. World-wide clinical studies, using pulsed, low-intensity ultrasound for treatment of non-union in a self-paired control study design, have demonstrated a heal rate of 88% with an average treatment time of 4.5 months in non-unions and an average fracture age of 23 months. The therapy is safe and non-invasive, and is used by the patient at home for a 20-minute treatment session per day.","1515":"A major discrepency exists between the number of available cadaveric livers and patients requiring liver transplants, which has resulted in the innovative procurement of liver segments taken from healthy donors being implanted into cirrhotic patients. Most recently, liver surgeons have started resecting the entire right lobe (segments V-VIII) from healthy adult donor livers, and implanting these segments into recipients where the graft is able to sustain and maintain metabolic function and fully regenerate.","1516":"Compared to the other organ transplantations, lung and heart-lung transplantations have the following peculiarities: (1) bacterial colonization of the bronchi or lung parenchyma is almost constant because of the contact of donor's and recipient's lungs to the air through the intubation tube; (2) the lung is a particularly fragile organ and sensitive to the hemodynamic modifications in the donor following brain death; (3) the lung is the only organ transplanted without systemic revascularization, which increases the risks of bronchial ischemia, bronchomalacia, and mucociliary dysfunction; and (4) the lung has a large amount of lymphoid tissue, rendering it particularly immunogenic.","1517":"The concept of transluminal treatment of vascular obstruction by the percutaneous approach was introduced by Dotter and Judkins, in 1964. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) developed rapidly into an extremely important therapeutic modality for relieving symptomatic obstructions in major arteries. However, it was not until 1969 that Dotter reported the successful placement of coiled stainless steel wire endarterial tube grafts, with the aid of a catheter, into the popliteal arteries of dogs. This procedure stimulated the worldwide development and clinical application of endovascular stenting.","1518":"Indications for endoluminal treatment of occlusive aorto-iliac disease are well known. Endovascular grafting is a technique currently being evaluated for its efficacy for treatment of aneurysmal disease. The success of those techniques is due to their favorable results and non-invasive characteristics. X-ray contrast angiography (CA) is the most currently used imaging modality for endovascular procedures; however, the iodinated contrast agent is directly responsible for systemic and renal adverse effects in 3% to 12% of patients.","1519":"During recent years, a rapid progress in the area of minimally invasive heart surgery has been seen. In addition to operations through smaller incisions and those without a complete median sternotomy, minimally invasive in cardiac surgery also means--and this might be even more important--performing the operation without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Documented evidence indicates that CPB is an independent risk factor for end-organ injury after heart surgery. However, discussion continues regarding whether off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) techniques allow the same (or better) outcomes in long-term graft patency, myocardial damage, and associated morbidity compared with the classic operation done on CPB. That is one of the reasons the German insurance companies still do not accept OPCAB techniques as a viable alternative for surgical coronary revascularization, although the avoidance of CPB appears to have the greatest potential to minimize procedural costs and, consequently, provide economic benefit.","1520":"Among the different techniques of mitral valve repair (involving chordea, commissures, papillary muscles, leaflets, or annulus), the annuloplasty remains a difficult problem-solving step. Since invention of the first ring, which was rigid and closed, the concept of annuloplasty has taken into consideration the following objectives: to make the available leaflet tissue well fitted to the systolic mitral orifice by repairing the length and shape of the dilated annulus, prevent its further dilatation, and provide a support to the fragile area after a partial leaflet resection.","1521":"The purpose of this communication is to provide an overview of modern cardiac valvular devices for replacement and reconstruction used worldwide, as well as innovative technologies and devices poised to improve clinical performance.","1522":"After the first description of laparoscopic adrenalectomy was published in 1992, this method rapidly attracted widespread interest. Similar to conventional open techniques two main approaches have ben established for the minimally invasive adrenalectomy: the transabdominal and the retroperitoneal. With the transabdominal technique several different routes for exploration of the glands are possible as the patient can be operated on in a lateral, semi-lateral, or even in a supine position for both glands. Determining the best approach for the left side is further complicated because of the many possible techniques for exploration: through the gastrolienal, gastrocolic, or splenophrenic ligaments. The authors have developed a new method for the left laparoscopic adrenalectomy using the splenophrenic approach.","1523":"The laparoscopic application of an adjustable silicone gastric band (Lap-Band System, Bioenterics, Carpinteria, CA) (Fig. 1), based on a similar device introduced by Kuzmak in 1986, is gaining widespread acceptance as a gastric restrictive procedure in treatment of morbid obesity. The advantage of an operation that does not open the gastrointestinal tract and can be performed laparoscopically is obvious. This procedure, using the laparoscopic approach , has been performed in our institutions since 1992. The goals of this article are to describe both our standardized surgical technique that minimized the morbidity rate and its results.","1524":"Some of the numerous anomalies of the biliary tract and its vasculature are incompatible with life, whereas others are only medical curiosities. Many, however, are the cause of symptoms, and all are of particular concern to the surgeon who must operate in this area. An example is situs inversus totalis, an anomaly of the biliary tract that can present difficulties in management of abdominal disorders. We present a case of transposition of the viscera (situs inversus) with cholelithiasis, treated successfully with laparoscopy cholecystectomy. This article further affirms the safety and efficacy of laparoscopy in the setting of situs inversus totalis after giving due attention to the details of left-right reversal.","1525":"Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and deadly solid cancers. At least one million new patients are diagnosed annually with this cancer. Incidence in non-Western countries is related to infections of hepatitis B virus and dietary ingestion of aflatoxins, whereas in Western countries alcohol-related cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis C virus infection are leading causes of HCC. In the United States, approximately 155,000 new cases of cancer of the liver and bile duct occur annually, with the majority being colorectal metastases.","1526":"The liver has a central role in human metabolism and represents one of the organ systems most often affected, especially by tumor diseases. The group of colorectal carcinomas metastatically almost exclusively attacks this organ, which, according to studies by Weiss and colleagues, can be attributed to venous drainage of the intestines through the portal vein. A large number of primary tumors often cause liver metastases as well as bone, lung, and brain metastases. After curative sanitation of the primary tumor, the liver infestation has a decisive influence on survival time of affected patients in many instances.","1527":"The high risk of hernia recurrence as reported in the literature has prompted a significant increase in use of prosthetic materials for repair of groin hernias. The speed of recovery after surgery, as well as cost and simplicity, has become a much more important consideration than in the past, now that the risk of recurrence has been lowered with modern techniques.","1528":"Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common disease that occurs in one of 500 women and one of 2,000 men over the age of 40. In 85% to 90% of patients, primary HPT is caused by a solitary parathyroid adenoma. Recent advances in evaluation and surgical management of HPT, including improved localization techniques and intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) monitoring, have permitted a more targeted approach to parathyroid surgery.","1529":"Leiomyosarcoma of the vulva is a rare gynaecological malignancy. To date, only few cases have been reported in the literature, the majority of which are from Western countries. Although leiomyosarcoma is classically regarded as a malignant tumor, the generally favorable prognosis following surgical treatment, as well as its reduced propensity for widespread metastasis, makes it one of the most enigmatic malignancies in the medical literature. In addition, the tumor may attain enormous morphological proportions, a situation unusual in many malignant tumors.","1530":"The surgeon's working environment has changed continuously in recent years regarding the technical complexity of the components in use in the operating room (OR). Parallel to this development, demands for process-optimized procedures have also grown constantly. The impetus for these changes was the beginning of use of minimally invasive techniques in surgery. In contrast, overall development of the OR itself has been slight or nonexistent. What we are typically confronted with currently is an OR outfitted with high-tech medical equipment, whereas only to a limited extent can the design of the OR itself be regarded as ergonomic or holistic. This situation has spread to related specialties as well, and represents a general tendency. Whereas dentists, for example, already enjoy the benefits of a centralized management and operation workplace, this development has not yet reached a satisfactory level for surgeons.","1531":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy, mostly performed for pancreatic cancer, has been associated with considerable morbidity rates (40%-60%) and mortality rates (20%-30%). Even after resection, the prognosis is poor, and as a result some physicians have kept a nihilistic approach; Gudjonsson concluded in his review that pancreatic resections are a waste of resources. During the last decade, mortality rates have decreased dramatically to less than 5% in centers with experience, and have led to a more optimistic view in favor of resection.","1532":"Local hemostasis is critical for successful surgical intervention and may be accomplished with a variety of techniques ranging from direct pressure to lasers. Critical assessment of the clinical situation is required to determine the appropriate technology necessary to achieve effective hemostasis. As a general rule, ligatures remain the mainstay for effecting hemostasis in all but the smallest isolated vessels. Although ligatures have been in use since the first century AD, both the applications as well as their sophistication have increased dramatically. As sutures are foreign material to the human body, tissue reaction is unavoidable. This response may be mitigated, but not eliminated completely, through the use of non-absorbable sutures. The body's inflammatory response triggers a complex cascade of cellular and biochemical events that lead to fibrinogenesis and coagulation. This process, in turn, results in an increased deposition of collagen that may result in formation of adhesions.","1533":"Postoperative ileus, a temporary inhibition of gastrointestinal function, is a universal complication after major abdominal surgery. Treatment for ileus is supportive, and has changed little since Wangensteen's 1932 report. Nasogastric suction could delay or replace operative management of bowel obstruction, thereby reducing mortality. Gastric decompression, together with intravenous (IV) hydration and electrolyte replacement, remains the only proven therapy for ileus.","1534":"A telerobotic device, the daVinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Mountain View, CA) is one of the recently developed, remotely operated systems for laparoscopic surgical procedures. This telemanipulation system consists of two components: a control console operated by the surgeon, and the surgical arm cart that holds a three-dimensional (3-D) 30 degrees laparoscope and two detachable laparoscopic surgical tools. The instruments are equipped with a wrist--a unique feature that provides additional dexterity. Since its clinical introduction in Europe in early 1999, this system has opened up a new era in minimally invasive surgery enhancing endoscopic vision and anastomosis suturing. For the first time, cardiac surgeons were able to perform a totally endoscopic coronary bypass procedure on a beating heart.","1535":"President Clinton's Advisory Commission report on Consumer Protection &amp; Quality in the Health-Care Industry, identified medical error prevention as an important issue in health-management. Patient safety is finally being institutionalized due to growing concern over the increasing cost of human error. Medicine's punitive perfectibility model in dealing with unintended injury is slowly evolving to accept error during operations as an inevitable, yet manageable, reality of surgery.","1536":"Traumatic and end-stage organ loss or tissue damage remains a devastating issue for everyone, and a major problem for millions of patients. It has been estimated that each year in the United States more than 8 million surgical operations are performed to solve these health problems.","1537":"Gastric cancer, if diagnosed at the symptomatic stage, has a poor prognosis, with an overall 5 year survival of about 5%. The surgical treatment of early gastric cancer increases this 5-year survival rate to 90%. In Japan, endoscopic surveillance has increased the proportion of gastric cancer detected at an early stage from 15% in 1960 to 50% in 1985, and the overall 5 year survival has been increased from 35% to 70%. Mass screening in Japan is worthwhile because the incidence of gastric cancer is about 80 cases per 100,000 population per annum (age standardized). But in other countries where the incidence is much lower the case for mass screening is weak and selective screening of those at high risk is advocated.","1538":"Cancer is a major public health concern. Current estimates suggest that approximately 3 out of every 10 people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetime. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that about 1.25 million people in the US will be diagnosed with cancer each year, with nearly 550,000 subsequent deaths. The financial burden of cancer and cost in human lives is staggering. In 1990,it was estimated that the economic burden from cancer in the US was $104 billion: $35 billion for direct costs of prevention, diagnosis and treatment; $12 billion for morbidity costs (economic losses caused by days lost from productive activity because of illness-related disability); and $57 billion in mortality costs (lost economic output measured by loss in earnings because of premature death of productive individuals).","1539":"As a result of advances in surgical technique and immunosuppressive therapy, the incidence and the consequences of post-transplant surgical complications has decreased. However, surgical complications still cause considerable morbidity and test the skills of the surgical team. Several reviews have been published analyzing the incidence of these complications and the management strategies employed to correct them. We report some uncommon or rare complications encountered in our unit after the introduction of low-dose steroids or steroid-free immunosuppressive protocols.","1540":"Computer modeling has had an undoubtedly enormous impact on the field of bone research in recent years. Development of advanced computer based models has permitted researchers to explore a vast area of musculoskeletal science from the complex biophysical stimuli at the cellular level to the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous skeletal structures. Furthermore, computer modeling has given significant impetus to the impressive progress of modern bone implant development. With recent advances in computers, faster hardware and increasingly sophisticated software, the prospects for the future of computer-based bone research appear more exciting than ever.","1541":"Medial migration of the acetabular cup and protrusio of the medial wall is a well recognized failure mechanism of acetabular fixation in cemented total hip arthroplasty. In the protruded acetabulum, a medialized position of the acetabular component is associated with increased medial cortical bone stresses, while more lateral positioning reduces the medial stresses. Use of a protrusio ring or medial wire mesh may limit medial migration. However, late failure of acetabular revision reconstructions can occur when cemented protrusio rings or wire mesh reinforcement are used without bone grafting.","1542":"The surgical approach is an important element in the quality of total hip replacement. Adequate surgical exposure based upon thorough fundamental knowledge of anatomy facilitates surgery and ensure optimum results in total hip replacement. Several surgical exposure techniques are utilized and have been described in the literature; all stress the importance of visualization of the acetabulum and the proximal femur in affording an atraumatic, expedient entry into the hip joint. Additionally, surgical exposure should be versatile, allowing for development to easily accommodate revision scenarios.","1543":"Venous thromboembolic disease remains a common and potentially fatal complication after total joint arthroplasty. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been reported to be between 5% and 60% in a number of studies using a variety of prophylaxis regimens. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism has been documented as high as 23%, while fatal pulmonary embolism, although relatively infrequent, remains one of the most catastrophic complications of total joint arthroplasty.","1544":"Femoral revision in total hip replacement (THR) is often demanding due to severe bone defects of the proximal femur. The surgical technique must provide sufficient stability in the distal femur. However, long-term stability depends on preserving or even rebuilding proximal bone stock.","1545":"A septic loosening and osteolysis can compromise the available host bone in patients requiring revision hip arthroplasty. Secure fixation of revision femoral components may not be possible if reliant only on proximal femoral bone for biologic fixation or cement interdigitation. The challenge for the revision arthroplasty surgeon is to find the best method to secure the implant in a femur with deficient bone proximally that will provide stability for load bearing and motion. In addition to providing stability, the implant must be durable and maintain long-term fixation. With over 16 years of experience with fully porous coated femoral revision implants, we have found that maximizing prosthetic-bone fit in the proximal femoral diaphyseal bone provides reliable long-term fixation in the majority of femoral revision cases.","1546":"Closed antegrade intramedullary nailing is the current standard of care for the treatment of femoral shaft fractures. This technique has been shown to have excellent results demonstrated by a high rate of fracture union and the low incidence of infection. However, there are complications specific to antegrade intramedullary nailing, as well as specific injury patterns that make this treatment less attractive.","1547":"Arthritis of the trapezio metacarpal joint (TMJ) is a very frequent condition, which affects women more than men, especially in the fifth or sixth decade of life. It can be very painful and disabling and the patient will need surgery for relief even if it can result in painless stiffening (in adduction of the metacarpal and hypertension of the metacarpal, which in turn is very disabling). TMJ arthritis is rarely primary or idiopathic; in general, it is secondary to instability of the joint, which, in turn, may be primary or secondary.","1548":"The recent evolution of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been substantial and unlike that of total hip arthroplasty (THA). The current THA technique is similar to that initially developed and perfected by Professor John Charnley in the mid 1960s. The ball-and-socket articulation of the hip is simple and reproducible biomechanically. The long term (20 years and longer) results with total hip arthroplasty have been very satisfactory. The THA prosthetic designs of today remain similar to those of years past. Improvements have been in biomaterials, methods of fixation and surgical technique. The total knee arthroplasty prostheses of today differ greatly from their predecessors.","1549":"Revascularization of all significantly stenosed vessels remains the goal of coronary artery bypass surgery. Recent improvements in endoscopic instruments have resulted in the evolution of selective left anterior descending artery bypass grafting through a limited anterior small thoracotomy (LAST) incision. A major limitation of this technique is the inaccessibility for complete surgical revascularization in multivessel disease. In this article, we describe a minimally invasive technique for total coronary artery revascularization that combines conventional surgical techniques with the advantages of minimally invasive surgery. We have performed total coronary revascularization in 52 patients over a period of 16 months with consistently good results.","1550":"The port-access technique for cardiac surgery was recently developed at Stanford University in California as a less invasive method to perform some cardiac operations. The port-access system has been described in detail elsewhere. It is based on femoral arterial and venous access for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and on the adoption of a specially designed triple-lumen catheter described originally by Peters, and subsequently modified and developed in the definitive configuration called the endoaortic clamp.","1551":"Intraoperative measurement of flow allows functional evaluation of coronary bypass grafts and may be predictive of a patient's immediate and late outcome after myocardial revascularization as it permits early detection of technical errors. Many different methods have been used to assess the quality of the anastomosis intraoperatively. Angiography is considered the gold standard technique to which all other methods should be compared. However, it is invasive, costly, time consuming, and not always readily accessible in the operating room.","1552":"Most surgeons use a longitudinal right lateral left atrial incision behind the inter-atrial groove for the exposure of the mitral valve, even though several other surgical techniques have been described. The shortest route to the mitral valve is, however, through the roof of the left atrium, where the incision is closest to the mitral annulus. This was first described by Meyer et al., but the approach became unpopular because of its technical difficulties and inadequacies. We have modified this technique, making it safer, easier and adaptable to any type of mitral surgery. We describe our experience with 53 patients who had mitral valve surgery using this modified approach. All of the operations were performed by the same surgeon over an 18 month period with consistently satisfactory results.","1553":"In recent years mitral valve repair has gained increasing acceptance as the preferred treatment for mitral insufficiency. Mitral valve repair has many advantages. The surgical risk is lower than prosthetic valve replacement. Improved preservation of left ventricular function due to maintenance of the papillary muscle - mitral annular continuity - has been demonstrated. Thromboembolism is rare after mitral repair in patients in sinus rhythm. These patients receive no coumadin and thus are free from bleeding complications. The repaired valves have been shown to have durability comparable to or better than prosthetic valves.","1554":"Complete myocardial revascularization is associated with improved quality of life, increased overall survival, and the lack of any major adverse clinical events (requiring reintervention, reoperation, and readmission for recurrent symptoms). However, the trauma of access often exceeds the trauma of surgical treatment, while achieving complete revascularization. Another trade-off for complete revascularizarion is often increased morbidity, mortality, cost and post-operative stay.","1555":"Endoscopic surgery is not a recent development. In fact, the application of the Edison light bulb to the cystoscope in 1883 was followed by widespread use of endoscopy. In 1910, Jacobeaus proposed the diagnostic use of the cystoscope for investigation of serous cavities, and in 1922, he reported lysis of pleural adhesions to promote artificial pneumothorax in 40 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. For the next 30 years, the thoracoscope was widely used for pneumolysis in tuberculosis patients, but its use waned considerably after the development of effective antibiotic treatment for tuberculosis. With the advent of laparoscopy, endoscopy has become popular again and here we review the application of endoscopic techniques in cardiovascular surgery.","1556":"Chronic leg ulceration affects about 1 to 2 % of the European population. Although the pathogenesis of venous ulceration is not completely understood, it is generally agreed that the transmission of high ambulatory pressures through incompetent perforating veins plays a major role. There are only limited data available to assess the long-term prognosis for leg ulcer patients.","1557":"Laparoscopic hysterectomy and pelvic floor reconstruction have recently undergone some degree of evolution. New instrumentation has appeared, such as the vaginal delineator, but overall most of the instruments used have remained basically unchanged. This is related mostly to the need of keeping costs down by limiting the use of disposable instrumentation. For pelvic reconstruction, the laparoscopic approach is now usually considered the optimal approach, as it allows the surgeon to visualize structures that the vaginal surgeon could in the past only palpate.","1558":"While surgical infections are seemingly a heterogeneous group of disease entities, there are several common features that permit a general approach to their diagnosis and management. These properties include: the polymicrobial nature of the flora in most infections, the association of the infection with some underlying pathological process, and appropriate treatment often includes both broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and some surgical or radiological intervention to promote eradication of the infection. For the purpose of this review, intra-abdominal infection will be used as the prototypical surgical infection because it embodies many of the general features of most infections.","1559":"Revascularization of the coronary or lower extremity circulation ideally requires an autologous conduit. The saphenous vein is the most commonly used graft. Minimally invasive surgical techniques for harvesting of the greater saphenous vein (GSV) are gaining popularity. With better instruments, critical evaluation of techniques and longer follow-up of patients, the outcome of such vein harvesting is improving. An increasing number of authors are reporting a variety of techniques with reduction in wound complications compared to conventional surgery.","1560":"A number of patients undergoing major surgery have an associated high morbidity leading to a long stay in the intensive care unit. This group of patients can be regarded as high risk, as their mortality rate is in the region of 20 to 30%. The high-risk patient is likely to have at least one of the characteristics listed in Table 1. Perioperative cardiac morbidity remains the leading cause of postoperative mortality. Although we can now support patients through the early phase of shock, trauma or other life-threatening illness, some will go on to develop progressive failure of one or more vital organs. In this article, we review some of the current processes of care that may improve outcomes in these surgical patients, as improving patient outcome is the purpose of medical care.","1561":"Gastric endo-organ surgery is a minimally invasive procedure combining the use of gastroesophageal endoscopy and laparoscopy to approach intragastric problems that require surgical intervention. The advantages include: less scarring; shorter hospital stays; and less postoperative discomfort than conventional laparotomy. The technique requires placement of two or three percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies in various positions on the gastric wall. Filipi et al. developed a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) that is large enough to allow the use of 5 and 10mm laparoscopic instruments for intragastric surgery. In this article we review the complications related to the introduction of this access port.","1562":"There is a need for secure and easy methods for suturing in laparoscopic surgery, no matter whether vessels are to be ligated, two structures sutured together, or the cystic duct is to be occluded in cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic suturing can be done with a suture, using automatic sewing devices or clips. Improper ligation of a vessel for example can result in bleeding, which is more difficult to treat in a laparoscopic procedure than in an open procedure. By using a Roeder knot in laparoscopic suturing, tying of the knot requires some expertise and makes the procedure more complicated and time-consuming.","1563":"Endoscopic adrenalectomy, since its initial description in 1992 by Gagner et al. in Canada and by Higashaihara in Japan has emerged as the standard of care in the treatment of patients with benign adrenal neoplasms. It has been shown to be as effective as open surgery in treating adrenal pathology, with improvements in pain, cosmesis and duration of hospitalization.","1564":"Morbid obesity is a serious disease that is responsible for several co-morbid conditions. Patients with a body mass index of over 40 kg\/m2 will require surgical intervention if a dietary program fails. In the US, patients who are morbidly obese number approximately 8 million. At present, three conventional operations, with acceptable early and late complication rates, are performed most frequently worldwide: vertical gastroplasty (VRG), vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), and gastric bypass (GB). In this article, we describe our experience with the LAP-BAND technique, and in particular with the new LAP-BAND adjustable gastric banding system (LAGB), which further reduces postoperative complications and reoperations.","1565":null,"1566":"","1567":"In comparison to medical treatment, antireflux surgery is recognized as an effective, efficient and longlasting therapy, as well as the only treatment that is able to modify the natural history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The 360 fundoplication is the most widely used surgical procedure for GERD. Although performed in the era of H2-blockers and open surgery, comparison of the so-called Nissen repair to both symptomatic and continuous medical therapies concluded that surgery was superior to medical therapy in every outcome measure used.","1568":"The success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has resulted in the broad application of minimally invasive techniques in many surgery specialties. The theoretical advantages of laparoscopy over conventional open operations, including less postoperative pain, faster overall recovery, and better cosmetic results have been achieved leading to its acceptance by surgeons and the public alike. Numerous abdominal procedures have been adapted to minimally invasive approaches including bowel resection, inguinal and ventral hernia repair, anti-reflux techniques, and solid organ removal such as splenectomy.","1569":"The diagnostic information in scintigraphic images is generally not contained in specific morphological image attributes, but in the regional distribution of count rate densities across the organ volumes. In a subclass of scintigraphic images, the evaluation is actually based on a dual comparison.","1570":"Venous ulcers are a common cause of pain and suffering in the elderly US population. Up to 1 million individuals suffer from this disease, and the true costs in terms of medical care and quality of life are only beginning to be appreciated. Bioengineered skin constructs are being used increasingly to treat venous ulcers with some success and can be used if traditional first-line treatment methods fail.","1571":"Over the last decade, the laparoscopic approach has become the preferred method of intervention for many procedures, including cholecystectomy, appendectomy, inguinal hernia repair, lung biopsy, hysterectomy, and numerous orthopaedic procedures. Laparoscopic surgery is not an intuitive skill and must be developed through long hours of training, practice, and clinical experience. While surgeons may become proficient in the use of current laparoscopic instruments, many of them feel the advancement of laparoscopic surgery is hampered by the limited functionality of their instruments.","1572":"Since 1990 new developments have found their way into almost every area of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), and nowadays, 90% of all gynecological operations and 80% of all abdominal operations can be performed by this approach. In contrast to surgical development, operating room (OR) design has not progressed much over the past half century. While a number of surgical suites have been designed for specific specialties, more commonplace is the flexible OR concept.","1573":"UP to 30% of those who undergo surgery potentially develop a surgical site infection depending on the procedure performed. Infection increases the risk of further complications, lengthens hospital stays and increases management costs. A significant proportion of surgical site infections are caused by Staphyloccoccus spp. and prior nasal carriage is a risk factor for post surgical infection.","1574":"After the meteoric entry of minimally invasive surgery onto the general surgery scene 9 years ago, it currently stands at a crossroads with regard to the 21st century. Many challenges hamper safe and costeffective deployment of minimally invasive techniques. There must be a stabilization and reduction of complication rates associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Common bile duct injuries are in fact two to three times higher for laparoscopic cholecystectomy than for the open procedure. This matter has been discussed only at local morbidity and mortality conferences or at national meetings. Patients are being injured. The surgical community has failed to police itself and the public knows it. This led in 1992 to New York State health officials setting standards of training and surgeon preparedness for performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. If surgeons don't handle the problem, the politicians and the lawyers soon will.","1575":"Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) has been sporadically described in the past to assist the surgeon during operations of complexity or when operations require specimen removal. The hand will offer the surgeon an advantage in terms of tactile feedback, exposure, retraction, or orientation so that it will enable him or her to operate with greater safety and efficiency. The fundamental pre-requisite for successful HALS is a reliable hand-assist device. We perform HALS for complex advanced laparoscopic surgery where it may save time, increase accuracy and improve safety. Additionally, this approach is considered for any operation that requires specimen removal, since an enlarged incision may be required. Early introduction of the hand may facilitate dissection and specimen removal.","1576":"Laser tissue welding is a relatively new technique, which was initially described only about 30 years ago. Over the past 10 years, the implementation of protein solders has redefined the field. Alternative methods of wound closure and of tissue approximation have been quickly accepted in clinical medicine. The techniques and theory involved in performing laser tissue welding may soon be essential knowledge for all surgeons. Just as laparoscopy has become a mainstay for general surgeons and urologists, novel mechanisms of tissue approximation will continue to replace older, less efficacious techniques.","1577":"Tumor development, growth and progression depends on an adequate vascular supply, which derives from the host vasculature. This process involves complex interactions between tumor cells and nonneoplastic vasculature, the immune system, and the connective tissues. Tumor angiogenesis refers to the development of new vessels within the tumor. An imbalance between angiogenic growth factors and inhibitors released by the tumor cells and\/or endothelial and inflammatory cells is necessary to produce tumor neovascularization. In the last two decades, several studies have clarified the main aspects of this phenomenon, although further analysis will be necessary to understand if tumoral neoangiogenesis can play a pivotal role as a potential target for innovative anticancer therapies. Here, I review and update the basic aspects of tumor angiogenesis, as well as the role of the quantitative analysis of tumor vasculature as an independent prognostic indicator in human cancers.","1578":"Gastric cancer, if diagnosed at the symptomatic stage, has a poor prognosis, with an overall 5 year survival of about 5%. The surgical treatment of early gastric cancer increases this 5-year survival rate to 90%. In Japan, endoscopic surveillance has increased the proportion of gastric cancer detected at an early stage from 15% in 1960 to 50% in 1985, and the overall 5 year survival has been increased from 35% to 70%. Mass screening in Japan is worthwhile because the incidence of gastric cancer is about 80 cases per 100,000 population per annum (age standardized). But in other countries where the incidence is much lower the case for mass screening is weak and selective screening of those at high risk is advocated.","1579":"Cancer is a major public health concern. Current estimates suggest that approximately 3 out of every 10 people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetime. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that about 1.25 million people in the US will be diagnosed with cancer each year, with nearly 550,000 subsequent deaths. The financial burden of cancer and cost in human lives is staggering. In 1990,it was estimated that the economic burden from cancer in the US was $104 billion: $35 billion for direct costs of prevention, diagnosis and treatment; $12 billion for morbidity costs (economic losses caused by days lost from productive activity because of illness-related disability); and $57 billion in mortality costs (lost economic output measured by loss in earnings because of premature death of productive individuals).","1580":"As a result of advances in surgical technique and immunosuppressive therapy, the incidence and the consequences of post-transplant surgical complications has decreased. However, surgical complications still cause considerable morbidity and test the skills of the surgical team. Several reviews have been published analyzing the incidence of these complications and the management strategies employed to correct them. We report some uncommon or rare complications encountered in our unit after the introduction of low-dose steroids or steroid-free immunosuppressive protocols.","1581":"Computer modeling has had an undoubtedly enormous impact on the field of bone research in recent years. Development of advanced computer based models has permitted researchers to explore a vast area of musculoskeletal science from the complex biophysical stimuli at the cellular level to the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous skeletal structures. Furthermore, computer modeling has given significant impetus to the impressive progress of modern bone implant development. With recent advances in computers, faster hardware and increasingly sophisticated software, the prospects for the future of computer-based bone research appear more exciting than ever.","1582":"Medial migration of the acetabular cup and protrusio of the medial wall is a well recognized failure mechanism of acetabular fixation in cemented total hip arthroplasty. In the protruded acetabulum, a medialized position of the acetabular component is associated with increased medial cortical bone stresses, while more lateral positioning reduces the medial stresses. Use of a protrusio ring or medial wire mesh may limit medial migration. However, late failure of acetabular revision reconstructions can occur when cemented protrusio rings or wire mesh reinforcement are used without bone grafting.","1583":"The surgical approach is an important element in the quality of total hip replacement. Adequate surgical exposure based upon thorough fundamental knowledge of anatomy facilitates surgery and ensure optimum results in total hip replacement. Several surgical exposure techniques are utilized and have been described in the literature; all stress the importance of visualization of the acetabulum and the proximal femur in affording an atraumatic, expedient entry into the hip joint. Additionally, surgical exposure should be versatile, allowing for development to easily accommodate revision scenarios.","1584":"Venous thromboembolic disease remains a common and potentially fatal complication after total joint arthroplasty. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been reported to be between 5% and 60% in a number of studies using a variety of prophylaxis regimens. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism has been documented as high as 23%, while fatal pulmonary embolism, although relatively infrequent, remains one of the most catastrophic complications of total joint arthroplasty.","1585":"Femoral revision in total hip replacement (THR) is often demanding due to severe bone defects of the proximal femur. The surgical technique must provide sufficient stability in the distal femur. However, long-term stability depends on preserving or even rebuilding proximal bone stock.","1586":"A septic loosening and osteolysis can compromise the available host bone in patients requiring revision hip arthroplasty. Secure fixation of revision femoral components may not be possible if reliant only on proximal femoral bone for biologic fixation or cement interdigitation. The challenge for the revision arthroplasty surgeon is to find the best method to secure the implant in a femur with deficient bone proximally that will provide stability for load bearing and motion. In addition to providing stability, the implant must be durable and maintain long-term fixation. With over 16 years of experience with fully porous coated femoral revision implants, we have found that maximizing prosthetic-bone fit in the proximal femoral diaphyseal bone provides reliable long-term fixation in the majority of femoral revision cases.","1587":"Closed antegrade intramedullary nailing is the current standard of care for the treatment of femoral shaft fractures. This technique has been shown to have excellent results demonstrated by a high rate of fracture union and the low incidence of infection. However, there are complications specific to antegrade intramedullary nailing, as well as specific injury patterns that make this treatment less attractive.","1588":"Arthritis of the trapezio metacarpal joint (TMJ) is a very frequent condition, which affects women more than men, especially in the fifth or sixth decade of life. It can be very painful and disabling and the patient will need surgery for relief even if it can result in painless stiffening (in adduction of the metacarpal and hypertension of the metacarpal, which in turn is very disabling). TMJ arthritis is rarely primary or idiopathic; in general, it is secondary to instability of the joint, which, in turn, may be primary or secondary.","1589":"The recent evolution of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been substantial and unlike that of total hip arthroplasty (THA). The current THA technique is similar to that initially developed and perfected by Professor John Charnley in the mid 1960s. The ball-and-socket articulation of the hip is simple and reproducible biomechanically. The long term (20 years and longer) results with total hip arthroplasty have been very satisfactory. The THA prosthetic designs of today remain similar to those of years past. Improvements have been in biomaterials, methods of fixation and surgical technique. The total knee arthroplasty prostheses of today differ greatly from their predecessors.","1590":"Revascularization of all significantly stenosed vessels remains the goal of coronary artery bypass surgery. Recent improvements in endoscopic instruments have resulted in the evolution of selective left anterior descending artery bypass grafting through a limited anterior small thoracotomy (LAST) incision. A major limitation of this technique is the inaccessibility for complete surgical revascularization in multivessel disease. In this article, we describe a minimally invasive technique for total coronary artery revascularization that combines conventional surgical techniques with the advantages of minimally invasive surgery. We have performed total coronary revascularization in 52 patients over a period of 16 months with consistently good results.","1591":"The port-access technique for cardiac surgery was recently developed at Stanford University in California as a less invasive method to perform some cardiac operations. The port-access system has been described in detail elsewhere. It is based on femoral arterial and venous access for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and on the adoption of a specially designed triple-lumen catheter described originally by Peters, and subsequently modified and developed in the definitive configuration called the endoaortic clamp.","1592":"Intraoperative measurement of flow allows functional evaluation of coronary bypass grafts and may be predictive of a patient's immediate and late outcome after myocardial revascularization as it permits early detection of technical errors. Many different methods have been used to assess the quality of the anastomosis intraoperatively. Angiography is considered the gold standard technique to which all other methods should be compared. However, it is invasive, costly, time consuming, and not always readily accessible in the operating room.","1593":"Most surgeons use a longitudinal right lateral left atrial incision behind the inter-atrial groove for the exposure of the mitral valve, even though several other surgical techniques have been described. The shortest route to the mitral valve is, however, through the roof of the left atrium, where the incision is closest to the mitral annulus. This was first described by Meyer et al., but the approach became unpopular because of its technical difficulties and inadequacies. We have modified this technique, making it safer, easier and adaptable to any type of mitral surgery. We describe our experience with 53 patients who had mitral valve surgery using this modified approach. All of the operations were performed by the same surgeon over an 18 month period with consistently satisfactory results.","1594":"In recent years mitral valve repair has gained increasing acceptance as the preferred treatment for mitral insufficiency. Mitral valve repair has many advantages. The surgical risk is lower than prosthetic valve replacement. Improved preservation of left ventricular function due to maintenance of the papillary muscle - mitral annular continuity - has been demonstrated. Thromboembolism is rare after mitral repair in patients in sinus rhythm. These patients receive no coumadin and thus are free from bleeding complications. The repaired valves have been shown to have durability comparable to or better than prosthetic valves.","1595":"Complete myocardial revascularization is associated with improved quality of life, increased overall survival, and the lack of any major adverse clinical events (requiring reintervention, reoperation, and readmission for recurrent symptoms). However, the trauma of access often exceeds the trauma of surgical treatment, while achieving complete revascularization. Another trade-off for complete revascularizarion is often increased morbidity, mortality, cost and post-operative stay.","1596":"Endoscopic surgery is not a recent development. In fact, the application of the Edison light bulb to the cystoscope in 1883 was followed by widespread use of endoscopy. In 1910, Jacobeaus proposed the diagnostic use of the cystoscope for investigation of serous cavities, and in 1922, he reported lysis of pleural adhesions to promote artificial pneumothorax in 40 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. For the next 30 years, the thoracoscope was widely used for pneumolysis in tuberculosis patients, but its use waned considerably after the development of effective antibiotic treatment for tuberculosis. With the advent of laparoscopy, endoscopy has become popular again and here we review the application of endoscopic techniques in cardiovascular surgery.","1597":"Chronic leg ulceration affects about 1 to 2 % of the European population. Although the pathogenesis of venous ulceration is not completely understood, it is generally agreed that the transmission of high ambulatory pressures through incompetent perforating veins plays a major role. There are only limited data available to assess the long-term prognosis for leg ulcer patients.","1598":"Laparoscopic hysterectomy and pelvic floor reconstruction have recently undergone some degree of evolution. New instrumentation has appeared, such as the vaginal delineator, but overall most of the instruments used have remained basically unchanged. This is related mostly to the need of keeping costs down by limiting the use of disposable instrumentation. For pelvic reconstruction, the laparoscopic approach is now usually considered the optimal approach, as it allows the surgeon to visualize structures that the vaginal surgeon could in the past only palpate.","1599":"While surgical infections are seemingly a heterogeneous group of disease entities, there are several common features that permit a general approach to their diagnosis and management. These properties include: the polymicrobial nature of the flora in most infections, the association of the infection with some underlying pathological process, and appropriate treatment often includes both broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and some surgical or radiological intervention to promote eradication of the infection. For the purpose of this review, intra-abdominal infection will be used as the prototypical surgical infection because it embodies many of the general features of most infections.","1600":"Revascularization of the coronary or lower extremity circulation ideally requires an autologous conduit. The saphenous vein is the most commonly used graft. Minimally invasive surgical techniques for harvesting of the greater saphenous vein (GSV) are gaining popularity. With better instruments, critical evaluation of techniques and longer follow-up of patients, the outcome of such vein harvesting is improving. An increasing number of authors are reporting a variety of techniques with reduction in wound complications compared to conventional surgery.","1601":"A number of patients undergoing major surgery have an associated high morbidity leading to a long stay in the intensive care unit. This group of patients can be regarded as high risk, as their mortality rate is in the region of 20 to 30%. The high-risk patient is likely to have at least one of the characteristics listed in Table 1. Perioperative cardiac morbidity remains the leading cause of postoperative mortality. Although we can now support patients through the early phase of shock, trauma or other life-threatening illness, some will go on to develop progressive failure of one or more vital organs. In this article, we review some of the current processes of care that may improve outcomes in these surgical patients, as improving patient outcome is the purpose of medical care.","1602":"Gastric endo-organ surgery is a minimally invasive procedure combining the use of gastroesophageal endoscopy and laparoscopy to approach intragastric problems that require surgical intervention. The advantages include: less scarring; shorter hospital stays; and less postoperative discomfort than conventional laparotomy. The technique requires placement of two or three percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies in various positions on the gastric wall. Filipi et al. developed a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) that is large enough to allow the use of 5 and 10mm laparoscopic instruments for intragastric surgery. In this article we review the complications related to the introduction of this access port.","1603":"Endoscopic adrenalectomy, since its initial description in 1992 by Gagner et al. in Canada and by Higashaihara in Japan has emerged as the standard of care in the treatment of patients with benign adrenal neoplasms. It has been shown to be as effective as open surgery in treating adrenal pathology, with improvements in pain, cosmesis and duration of hospitalization.","1604":"Morbid obesity is a serious disease that is responsible for several co-morbid conditions. Patients with a body mass index of over 40 kg\/m2 will require surgical intervention if a dietary program fails. In the US, patients who are morbidly obese number approximately 8 million. At present, three conventional operations, with acceptable early and late complication rates, are performed most frequently worldwide: vertical gastroplasty (VRG), vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), and gastric bypass (GB). In this article, we describe our experience with the LAP-BAND technique, and in particular with the new LAP-BAND adjustable gastric banding system (LAGB), which further reduces postoperative complications and reoperations.","1605":null,"1606":"","1607":"In comparison to medical treatment, antireflux surgery is recognized as an effective, efficient and longlasting therapy, as well as the only treatment that is able to modify the natural history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The 360 fundoplication is the most widely used surgical procedure for GERD. Although performed in the era of H2-blockers and open surgery, comparison of the so-called Nissen repair to both symptomatic and continuous medical therapies concluded that surgery was superior to medical therapy in every outcome measure used.","1608":"The success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has resulted in the broad application of minimally invasive techniques in many surgery specialties. The theoretical advantages of laparoscopy over conventional open operations, including less postoperative pain, faster overall recovery, and better cosmetic results have been achieved leading to its acceptance by surgeons and the public alike. Numerous abdominal procedures have been adapted to minimally invasive approaches including bowel resection, inguinal and ventral hernia repair, anti-reflux techniques, and solid organ removal such as splenectomy.","1609":"The diagnostic information in scintigraphic images is generally not contained in specific morphological image attributes, but in the regional distribution of count rate densities across the organ volumes. In a subclass of scintigraphic images, the evaluation is actually based on a dual comparison.","1610":"Venous ulcers are a common cause of pain and suffering in the elderly US population. Up to 1 million individuals suffer from this disease, and the true costs in terms of medical care and quality of life are only beginning to be appreciated. Bioengineered skin constructs are being used increasingly to treat venous ulcers with some success and can be used if traditional first-line treatment methods fail.","1611":"Over the last decade, the laparoscopic approach has become the preferred method of intervention for many procedures, including cholecystectomy, appendectomy, inguinal hernia repair, lung biopsy, hysterectomy, and numerous orthopaedic procedures. Laparoscopic surgery is not an intuitive skill and must be developed through long hours of training, practice, and clinical experience. While surgeons may become proficient in the use of current laparoscopic instruments, many of them feel the advancement of laparoscopic surgery is hampered by the limited functionality of their instruments.","1612":"Since 1990 new developments have found their way into almost every area of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), and nowadays, 90% of all gynecological operations and 80% of all abdominal operations can be performed by this approach. In contrast to surgical development, operating room (OR) design has not progressed much over the past half century. While a number of surgical suites have been designed for specific specialties, more commonplace is the flexible OR concept.","1613":"UP to 30% of those who undergo surgery potentially develop a surgical site infection depending on the procedure performed. Infection increases the risk of further complications, lengthens hospital stays and increases management costs. A significant proportion of surgical site infections are caused by Staphyloccoccus spp. and prior nasal carriage is a risk factor for post surgical infection.","1614":"After the meteoric entry of minimally invasive surgery onto the general surgery scene 9 years ago, it currently stands at a crossroads with regard to the 21st century. Many challenges hamper safe and costeffective deployment of minimally invasive techniques. There must be a stabilization and reduction of complication rates associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Common bile duct injuries are in fact two to three times higher for laparoscopic cholecystectomy than for the open procedure. This matter has been discussed only at local morbidity and mortality conferences or at national meetings. Patients are being injured. The surgical community has failed to police itself and the public knows it. This led in 1992 to New York State health officials setting standards of training and surgeon preparedness for performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. If surgeons don't handle the problem, the politicians and the lawyers soon will.","1615":"Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) has been sporadically described in the past to assist the surgeon during operations of complexity or when operations require specimen removal. The hand will offer the surgeon an advantage in terms of tactile feedback, exposure, retraction, or orientation so that it will enable him or her to operate with greater safety and efficiency. The fundamental pre-requisite for successful HALS is a reliable hand-assist device. We perform HALS for complex advanced laparoscopic surgery where it may save time, increase accuracy and improve safety. Additionally, this approach is considered for any operation that requires specimen removal, since an enlarged incision may be required. Early introduction of the hand may facilitate dissection and specimen removal.","1616":"Laser tissue welding is a relatively new technique, which was initially described only about 30 years ago. Over the past 10 years, the implementation of protein solders has redefined the field. Alternative methods of wound closure and of tissue approximation have been quickly accepted in clinical medicine. The techniques and theory involved in performing laser tissue welding may soon be essential knowledge for all surgeons. Just as laparoscopy has become a mainstay for general surgeons and urologists, novel mechanisms of tissue approximation will continue to replace older, less efficacious techniques.","1617":"Tumor development, growth and progression depends on an adequate vascular supply, which derives from the host vasculature. This process involves complex interactions between tumor cells and nonneoplastic vasculature, the immune system, and the connective tissues. Tumor angiogenesis refers to the development of new vessels within the tumor. An imbalance between angiogenic growth factors and inhibitors released by the tumor cells and\/or endothelial and inflammatory cells is necessary to produce tumor neovascularization. In the last two decades, several studies have clarified the main aspects of this phenomenon, although further analysis will be necessary to understand if tumoral neoangiogenesis can play a pivotal role as a potential target for innovative anticancer therapies. Here, I review and update the basic aspects of tumor angiogenesis, as well as the role of the quantitative analysis of tumor vasculature as an independent prognostic indicator in human cancers.","1618":"In 1838, Key described the pathological findings of two cases of cord compression by \"intervertebral substance.\" In the 1800s and early 1900s many cases of chondromas of the cervical spine were reported. In 1928 Stookey, described the clinical symptoms and anatomic location of cervical disk herniation. In 1934, Mixter and Barr documented four cervical disc protrusions. Before 1950, the standard approach to discs in this region was posteriorly with laminectomy. In the 1950s Bailey, Badgley, Cloward, Smith and Robinson popularized the anterior approach with interbody fusion. Hirsch in 1960, then Robertson in 1973, recommended cervical discectomy without fusion. Similar results were noted.","1619":"Nonunions and delayed unions have been classically defined by Bassett as an arrest of the fracture healing process at an intermediary stage of repair, at which time the fracture gap is bridged by fibrocartilage. It is estimated that approximately 10-20 % of long bone fractures in the United States will result in delayed unions when compared to the average rate of healing for the location and type of fracture. Many of these will go on to a nonunion if biological or biomechanical factors are not optimized to enhance healing. Additional commorbities such as smoking, ethanol abuse, malnutrition, malabsorption and altered neurologic conditions can contribute to delayed unions or nonunions. Even despite appropriate and aggressive early management of long bone fractures, a certain percentage still lack progression of healing and go on to nonunion. Classical surgical management of nonunions includes obtaininjg fracture stabilization with ORIF techniques and bone grafting, with reported clinical successes ranging from 50-80%. Those that fail to achieve union despite classical management are indeed recalcitrant nonunions.","1620":"There are no medical or surgical treatments able to repair traumatic paraplegia. Experiments done by connecting the above-the-lesion with the below-the-lesion cord by means of PNS grafts have always failed. The grafts are reinhabited by regrowing axons of the first motoneurons which however are not able to progress into the distal spinal cord. At the present state of knowledge no surgical treatment can cure paraplegia. Thousands of researchers are working all over the world in many different types of research ranging from molecular biology to embriology, and from biochemistry to pharmacology and surgery. None of these experiments have proved to be practically effective.","1621":"Direct bone-metal contact is considered the ideal condition in order to obtain stability of orthopaedic non cemented implants. To acheive this result various implant shapes and surfaces were proposed.","1622":"Reconstruction of the knee joint with an appropriate prosthetic component that accomplishes the alleviation of pain and the restoration of joint function represents the goal of primary and revision TKA. Revision TKA procedures present a variety of complicating factors not found in primary TKA cases.","1623":"When a surgical reconstruction is necessary for a patient with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, autologus tissue from either a bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring tendon grafts is preferable. There are relative and absolute contraindications for the use of either tissue, in addition to the surgeon's own preference. For example, a patient with Erlos-Danlos ligamentous laxity is not a candidate for a hamstring ACL reconstruction.","1624":"The indications for joint arthroscopy continue to expand rapidly as technology advances. Surgeons and patients alike are realizing a progression of benefits related to lower morbidity associated with arthroscopic procedures supplanting open surgeries. However, it is important in each new application to critically evaluate the operative expertise, theoretical advantages, and actual outcome data before deciding the relative benefit of an arthroscopic procedure versus an open one. This is especially true for shoulder surgery because of the complex and restricted anatomical spaces available for insertion of an arthroscope. Additionally, orthopaedic surgeons are just now developing a clear understanding of the pathology of the glenohumeral joint and subacromial space, and the indications for intervention in these areas. Although the practice of shoulder arthroscopy is still in an early stage of development, it was actually first described by Burman in 1931. In his cadaveric studies, with instruments that look remarkably similar to ours today, he describes both the portal placements and the glenohumeral anatomy in some detail. It was Burman's opinion that the shoulder was the easiest and most consistent of all joints to visualize.","1625":"Successful outcomes in the treatment of complete unilateral cleft-lip and palate (CUCL\/P) and complete bilateral cleft lip and palate (CBCLP) are not obtained universally, despite significant improvements in surgical techniques over the past three decades. In particular, deficient palatal growth may occur even when expert surgical treatment is rendered. The factors which contribute most significantly to unfavorable growth outcomes remain obscure.","1626":"The purpose of this article is to report the development and use of the custom Christensen prosthesis (Garrett modification) for total temporomandibular joint reconstruction, its indications, protocol, adjunctive treatment and evolution to present design.","1627":"The use of microsurgical techniques has significantly altered the management of lower extremity trauma. Indications for amputation or salvage continue to change, as microsurgical transplants have become more commonplace. Reconstruction of a severely traumatized leg usually involves multiple complicated procedures, each of which can cause its own set of complications. The historically high rate of complications of these procedures and the fact that the resultant limb is never completely normal has led some to the conclusion that severely traumatized limbs should not be salvaged. In order to evaluate our own results in light of these considerations we have reviewed our most recent experience with this difficult problem.","1628":"Endoscopy is ideally suited to any organ that is hollow and fluid filled. The ventricular system, although only 10% of the total intracranial volume, is the site of many pathological processes. It is filled with crystal clear cerebrospinal fluid and lined thoughout by ependyma. Unfortunately access to it is invariably through normal brain tissue, but morbidity can be limited by choosing areas that are not as eloquent as others. The size of the ventricles limits the type of scope and instrumentation that can be used, but as technology advances these limitations are diminishing.","1629":"Recent advances in computer graphics have facilitated three-dimensional image reconstruction from magnetic resonance (MR) imagea, contributing to better understanding of the morphological structure of the brain and to preoperative neurosurgical planning. Functional brain mapping used in conjunction with this three-dimensional imaging technique provides preoperative information regarding the three-dimensional relationship between the eloquent cortex and the location of lesions, and allows accurate preoperative planning. In this article, we present a preoperative simulation and intraoperative navigational system for use with three-dimensional functional images.","1630":"Endovascular intervention has become an increasingly more popular method of diagnosing and treating vascular disease. Its expanding scope includes applications ranging from visualization of the peripheral vascular system to coronary artery interventions. This trend is primarily a result of the limitations of angiography, the current imaging standard, when compared to angioscopy. Multiple disease entities, including atherosclerotic plaque, embolic debris, and thrombus, can not be differentiated between based on angiographic appearance. Angioscopy is a more sensitive method of distinguishing between the above disease states by allowing direct visualization of the luminal surface. The significance of this distinction lies in the fact that the treatment options are notably different based upon the diagnosis. Yet another advantage of angioscopy is its therapeutic value in addition to its diagnostic abilities. Directed embolectomy, guide-wire or catheter placement, or pseudointimal resection are all possible through the angioscope at the time of diagnosis.","1631":"Prompt aggressive treatment of diabetic ulcerations is mandatory for healing and subsequent limb salvage. Too often the complications involving the lower extremity are overlooked or mistreated and result in amputations. The cost involved in treatment is overwhelming. In 1992, the total health care cost for patients with diabetes in the United States was 105 billion dollars. Lower extremity complications account for 15%-20% of all diabetic admissions.","1632":"Cerebrovascular dysfunction characterized by the loss of endothelial integrity has been observed following ischemic and traumatic insults to the brain, resulting in the net movement of fluid and solute out of the intravascular space and into the interstitium. Following traumatic brain injury, the development of intracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral edema plays a major role in the high morbidity and mortality in these patients. Although the precise mechanisms responsible for the disruption of the normally tightly regulated cerebrovascular tissue interface remain unclear, there is increasing evidence implicating inflammatory events in this process through the transient opening of tight junctional complexes. This article will examine the interaction of astrocytes, activated neutrophils, and inflammatory mediators in inducing endothelial contraction, thereby physically opening the permeability barrier and allowing the net movement of fluid out of the intravascular space.","1633":"Coronary artery bypass surgery is an effective treatment for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. The overall mortality and cardiac morbidity associated with the procedure has progressively declined since the early days, mostly attributable to improvements in surgical and anesthetic techniques. Over the same period, however, the average age of patients undergoing surgery has risen considerably, and with it, the incidence of neurologic complications. Currently, neurologic complications are the leading cause of morbidity associated with the procedure, and death due to neurologic causes has increased from 7% to 20% of all deaths. These complications are reflected in prolonged hospitalization of patients, at dramatic cost both to the patient and to the health system as a whole.","1634":"In the past six years, laparoscopic surgery has gained widespread acceptance by both surgeon and patient. When compared to open surgical approaches, laparoscopic techniques for abdominal procedures lessen postoperative pain and morbidity, improve cosmesis, reduce hospital stay, facilitate early rehabilitation and return to normal activities. The application of laparoscopic techniques to intra-abdominal vascular procedures can be expected to provide similar benefits over conventional surgery.","1635":"In the past decade, laparoscopic and thoracoscopiC technology have significantly and irreversibly altered the approach to many general and thoracic surgical diseases. With advances in laparoscopy and thoracoscopy, the concept of a minimally invasive approach to cardiac surgery has been realized.","1636":"The rapid evolution of vascular surgical techniques over the last few years coupled with the availability of an adequate venous conduit has allowed a more liberal and successful approach to salvage ischemic limbs caused by advanced atherosclerosis. This aggressive approach can be exemplified by the construction of arterial bypasses to the terminal branches of tibial vessels. However, a significant number of patients will continue to face the threat of a major amputation because of insufficient amounts of vein(s) to perform a totally autogenous bypass to one of the infrapopliteal arteries.","1637":"Our research group has recently reported the partial amino acid sequence of an aortic adventitial collagen-associated fibrillar protein, which may be the target of an autoimmune response in patients with abdommal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Its apparent molecular weight is approximately 40 kDa, so we have named it aneurysm-associated antigenic protein-40 kDa (AAAP-40). It has similarities to microfibril-associated glycoprotein-36 kDa (MAGP-36), which was reported by Kobayashi et al. to have a tissue distribution limited to the aorta in pig; unlike other microfibrillar proteins which appear to distribute ubiquitously throughout the body with elastin. Accordingly, if AAAP-40 is the human homolog of MAGP-36, it would explain how an autoimmune reaction against this protein might have consequences more or less limited to the aorta and its branches.","1638":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an almost inevitable part of the aging process in men. Symptoms of BPH include slowing and interruption of the urinary stream, incomplete bladder emptying, hesitancy, post-micturition dribbling, frequency and nocturia. These symptoms may not cause an individual any inconvenience, but can lead to considerable interference to quality of life. In more severe cases, and especially if complications such as urinary retention occur, surgical relief of the obstruction is indicated. Traditionally, this has been by trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP). However, in the past decade, attempts to find alternative treatments to TURP have been stimulated by the desire to avoid the morbidity of TURP. The use of laser energy in this context has been evolving rapidly, and is the subject of this review.","1639":"The dilemma facing urologists dealing with patients complaining of a poor urinary stream and nocturia is whom to treat and how to treat. For the last few decades, most men complaining of these symptoms underwent a prostatectomy, as it was presumed that their symptoms were caused by an enlarged prostate obstructing the bladder outlet. Since \"prostatism\" was thought to be a progressive disease, related to the inexorable progression of prostatic size, once a man presented to his urologist with symptoms, treatment often followed. The rate of prostatectomy in the United States increased from 30% of men with urinary symptoms in the haven of 1960 to nearly 60% in 1990 and 1991 according to Medicare data. More recently, it has been recognized that 25-30% of men with prostatic symptoms do not actually have outflow obstruction. Even those patients who do have very severe symptoms and what appears to be outflow obstruction, may not need surgery as their symptoms may wax and wane, or they may be satisfactorily relieved with conservative management. Thus, the risk of benefit ratio for prostatectomy for males with symptoms with no clear relationship to bladder outlet obstruction is a problem.","1640":"Percutaneous renal surgery involves instrumentation of the renal collecting system (renal pelvis and calyces) via direct percutaneous access to diagnose and treat a multitude of urological conditions. This chapter will outline the indications, techniques, complications and results of this relatively new and effective operative approach.","1641":"Although the development of continuous-flow resectoscopes has revolutionized hysteroscopic surgery, the necessity of using electrolyte-free irrigating solutions to distend the uterus has also introduced a risk of serious or fatal clinical complications should a patient absorb an excessive volume of fluid during the operation.","1642":"The revolution in laparoscopic surgery demands implementation of adequate training programs preferably in an academic setting. The most dramatic progress over the last decade in the field of gynecology was undoubtedly the development of advanced operative laparoscopy. This has been initiated by an unprecedented technological revolution.","1643":"Endometriosis is prevalent: its incidence has been estimated to range from 5-10% in normal women, and up to 60% of women who present with infertility or chronic pelvic pain. Chronic pelvic pain is the reason for 10% of all office visits to a gynecologist, and 40% of all laparoscopies performed are done for chronic pelvic pain. Further, it is reported that one in seven or 15% of the gynecological patients seen have pelvic endometriosis, and it is the second most frequent indication for which the American female undergoes a hysterectomy. It has also been noted that the infertility associated with pelvic endometriosis increases with the stage of the disease.","1644":"Laparoscopic surgery has been at the forefront of gynecologic surgical innovation in the past decade. Significant benefits which have been realized by the utilization of laparoscopy include: 1) a reduced size of surgical incisions 2) reduced length of hospital stays 3) increased utilization of outpatient surgery 4) a more rapid postoperative recovery period 5) reduced morbidity and 6) reduced total costs of treatment. Recent refinements in surgical technique and instrumentation have allowed for the development of a new incarnation of laparoscopy which has the potential to further realize each of these goals. Office microlaparoscopy under local anesthesia is the most recent advance in gynecologic minimally invasive surgery.","1645":"Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is a procedure gaining in popularity over abdominal hysterectomy, for a number of different indications. According to a recent study by Wilcox, et al., over 1.7 million women underwent a hysterectomy procedure in the U.S. from 1988 through 1990, and two-thirds of the procedures for benign disease were performed for leiomyomata or endometriosis, indications typically afflicting women of child-bearing age. Seventy-five percent of the procedures included in the Wilcox study were abdominal hysterectomies, the remainder being vaginal hysterectomies. National Hospital Discharge Summary data reveal that 562,000 hysterectomies were performed in 1993, rendering hysterectomy second only to cesarean section in volume of annual Ob\/Gyn surgical procedures performed.","1646":"Endometriosis is one of the most enigmatic and common diseases encountered by the gynecologist in the reproductive-age female. An estimated 10% of reproductive-age women and 25-35% of infertile women have this progressive disease which may result in significant morbidity.","1647":"Diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis is the most frequent reason for gynecologic operative laparoscopy in the United States. It is therefore important for the laparoscopist to be thoroughly familiar with the current standards of diagnosis and management of this complex disease. The most common presentations where endometriosis is found are pelvic pain, infertility, and adnexal mass. The ovaries, the posterior leaf of the broad ligament, and the cul-de-sac are the most frequent locations, and the left side is more frequently affected than the right.","1648":"Hysteroscopy is gaining increasing acceptance among surgeons as the initial surgical treatment of choice for managing abnormal uterine bleeding and submucous fibroids. With refinements in electrosurgery and laser ablation instruments, and the development of continuous-flow resectoscopes, hysteroscopic techniques are proving to be cost-effective alternatives to hysterectomy for an ever expanding range of treatment indications.","1649":"Leiomyomas, the most common solid pelvic tumors, occur in 25% to 30% of women during their reproductive years. Approximately 20% to 50% of these women experience symptoms that require treatment, with the most common complaints being menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, pelvic pressure, and the appreciation of a pelvic mass.","1650":"Biliary atresia is a rare but important disease of infancy having an incidence of about 1 in 16,000 births. In most infants the disease process involves both the intra- and extra hepatic parts of the biliary system (Fig. 1) and histologically it has been characterized as a panductular cholangiopathy. Destruction and disappearance of biliary structures is progressive.","1651":"Over the past 25 years obstetricians have developed multiple techniques to diagnose fetal abnormalities whether they be structural or functional. Such diagnoses have allowed couples the option of pregnancy termination when legally permissible. In selective situations it has become possible to correct some abnormalities. In general, structural abnormalities have suggested surgical approaches, whereas metabolic abnormalities have generally been treated pharmacologically or genetically. Over the past few years there have been a number of advances in surgical therapies, some of which will be detailed here.","1652":"Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy has been gaining popularity along with other minimally invasive surgical techniques. With the sophistication of instruments, evaluation of techniques and longer follow-up of patients, the outcome of such repairs is changing. Many authors are reporting a variety of techniques, complications, and results compared to conventional surgery.","1653":"The discovery of modern techniques of breast reconstruction paralleled two major advancements in plastic and reconstructive surgery. The first was the identification of areas of cutaneous perfusion through underlying muscles, and the recognition that entire muscles could be rotated into new positions on a vascular pedicle of one dominant artery and vein. The use of the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap and a silicone breast implant to simulate the breast mound was the first truly elegant solution to a problem that had perplexed reconstructive surgeons for centuries. The second discovery was the Radovan tissue expander. The placement of the tissue expander underneath the chest wall muscles and its gradual expansion with stretching of the overlying tissues also provided a theoretically simple technique for breast mound reconstruction.","1654":"Right-sided sliding inguinal hernias usually involve the cecum and occasionally the ascending colon. Colocutaneous fistulas secondary to diverticular disease are rare and usually present with a short tract to the anterior abdominal wall. The authors describe a case of colocutaneous fistula secondary to diverticular disease in an inguinal hernia and review fistula formation after diverticular disease.","1655":"The principle of regional perfusion using cytostatic drugs resulted from a study by Klopp et al. who found that pain was alleviated and tumor size reduced when small doses of nitrogen mustard were injected into the regional arterial blood flow. The best results were obtained when venous return from the area involved was blocked. In 1956, the meeting of a cardiothoracic surgeon, a plastic surgeon and an oncological surgeon in the Department of Surgery at Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, resulted in the introduction of a new concept in the treatment of regionally recurrent malignant disease. It was postulated that if an area of the body could be isolated from the systemic circulation and sustained by an extracorporeal circuit utilizing a heart lung machine, it would be possible to produce a high concentration of a chemotherapeutic agent in the isolated perfusion circuit limited only by the toxicity to the sensitive structures within that area. At the end of the perfusion, the unbound drug could be removed, the circulation restored and any excisional surgery carried out as necessary. The patient would benefit by a maximal tumor chemotherapeutic exposure in the treated area while being protected from systemic toxicity. Ryan et al. developed techniques in the laboratory for isolation perfusion of the hind limb, mid gut, and liver of a dog. It was found that the dosage of nitrogen mustard tolerated in the hind limb was the equivalent of a single whole body systemic dose.","1656":"In breast cancer treatment axillary lymphadenectomy remains essential and necessary because of its role in prognosis and in treatment. Lymphatic nodal involvement is the most important finding for prognosis and indicates the necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy. Axillary lymphadenectomy decreases the risk of local and\/or regional recurrence, but it does not modify the survival rate. Unfortunately, axillary lymphadenectomy has a high morbidity rate, despite all improvements made in the last decades. The conventional surgical technique removes the intact axillary content, preserving large vascular and nervous elements, but destroys a certain amount of small arteries, veins, lymphatics and nerves. This leads to complications such as lymphorrhea and edema, hypoaesthesia, shoulder stiffness, pain, deformity of the axilla, long and unaesthetic scars and the most disabling of all, arm swelling.","1657":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has become the standard treatment for removing a diseased gallbladder. Endoscopic surgical techniques are used to perform appendectomies, bowel resections, and gastrectomies. This minimally invasive surgery is favored because it decreases the patients' postoperative pain and length of hospitalization. However the incidence of complications with this technique is not negligible. As a new technique is evolving, the potential for complications is high. This increase in complication rate is undoubtedly due to inexperience during the initial phase of the surgeon's learning curve. Demand for the procedure has required rapid training and credentialing of many surgeons with limited experience in endoscopy and the use of instruments that allow only limited viewing of abdominal structures.","1658":"The use of a balloon as a dissecting tool was pioneered by Gauer and Kieturakis in the early 1990s.This newapplication of balloon dissection in surgery allows the creation of a working space in which a procedure is performed. This is combined with minimally invasive techniques that confer the advantages of shorter recovery and less pain for several different procedures.","1659":"Minimal access surgery has revolutionized the practice of surgery. It has been shown that patients may experience less postoperative discomfort, shorter hospitalization, and quicker recuperation. The centerpiece of this revolution resides in the development of optical equipment which allowed the surgeon and his or her assistants to visualize on two-dimensional (2-D) monitors the site of the procedure to be performed. However, as techniques become more complicated, there is more need for accurate depth perception. In other surgical disciplines like neurosurgery, otorhynolaryngology, and microvascular surgery, for instance, magnification is used to perform fine manipulations; to prevent loss of depth perception, microscopes are binocular. They permit stereoscopic vision with accurate depth perception. We have used and evaluated a three-dimensional (3-D) videocamera system, designed for laparoscopy, in an in vitro situation, in the experimental laboratory and clinically, and we report our experience in this chapter. We also discuss the rationale for use of 3-D video systems.","1660":"The typical concept of endoscopic surgery is the performance of surgical procedures in the two major body cavities, the abdomen and thorax. To perform this, small incisions for the ports are needed to introduce optics and instruments. Typically, the optic and the instruments are introduced from different angles. The access itself is associated with a reduced trauma.","1661":"Colon cleansing preparations for diagnostic and surgical procedures continue to be evaluated in an effort to improve the quality of colon exam. Modifications of older barium enema x-ray preparations have led to the development of many alternative forms of bowel cleansing. Formal study has allowed carefui comparison of gut lavage, diet and cathartic as well as oral sodium phosphate preparation. Gut lavage with electrolyte lavage solutions represents the most popular form of bowel preparation. Patient variability and special circumstances such as gastroparesis, surgically altered anatomy or patient preferences may dictate selection of colon cleansing preparations.","1662":"Pneumothoraces and malignant pleural effusions are commonly encountered clinical problems in a general thoracic surgical practice. Pneumothoraces may be either iatrogenic or non-iatrogenic. Iatrogenic pneumothoraces can occur following transbronchial or percutaneous transthoracic lung biopsy, percutaneous central venous catheter insertion, or thoracentesis. Non-iatrogenic pneumothoraces are encountered frequently in the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and spontaneous rupture of pulmonary bullae, as well as blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma. Alternatively, pneumothoraces may be idiopathic or \"simple pneumothoraces.\"","1663":"The in situ destruction of malignant tissue by freezing is a relatively new addition to the list of treatment options for patients with cancer in solid organs. Although skin cancers have long been treated by cryosurgery, the lack of suitable equipment for both delivering and monitoring the freezing process hindered further development of the treatment of more inaccessible lesions until the 1960s. At this time, Cooperz developed cryosurgical machines which enabled the destruction of CNS lesions in patients with Parkinson's disease and stimulated renewed interest in the application of cryosurgery to the treatment of cancer.","1664":"At the end of the 20th Century, the world lives in the midst of a tremendous contradiction. On one side we have great scientific and technological progress, designed for the well-being of mankind, and on the other, the everyday widening gap between a few who have more than what they need and the vast majority of people who do not have enough.","1665":"Recently, hyperthermia has been employed clinically as one of a variety of multimodal therapies for cancer. Hyperthermia has been applied locally, regionally, and systemically to various tumors. Local or regional hyperthermia has the advantage that a localized tumor can be heated to temperatures higher than 420 C, the maximum for total-body hyperthermia. There is mounting evidence to support a hypothesis that cancer cells are more selectively sensitive to heat than are normal cells, due to the poor blood supply of neoplastic tissue and the decreased vasodilatation capacity of the neovascular bed.","1666":"The clinical management of painful conditions has seen great changes and improvements over the past two decades brought about, in a large part, by re-evaluating the basic theories on which we base our clinical practice. At the beginning of this century, we still believed in the model of pain transmission first expressed by Descartes, over 300 years ago. In the mid-1960s, a re-examination of transmission of pain was first promulgated and popularized. The Gate Control Theory of Melzak and Wall revolutionized the way we think about pain, and consequentially, the way we have come to treat it.","1667":"Intraoperative ultrasound of the pancreas is a dynamic clinical diagnostic field providing crucial information to the surgeon at the time of exploration, and impacting on clinical management decisions and choices of surgical techniques. It is a rapid and effective technique for imaging the entire pancreas, differentiating normal from pathological processes, imaging the pancreatic and common bile ducts, and demonstrating the exact relationship between pathological processes of the pancreas and the adjacent arterial and venous structures, the common bile duct, and the duodenal wall. The demand for intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) of the pancreas is expected to increase, particularly as management algorithms become accepted clinical practice, due to advances in intraoperative tumor ablation and radiotherapeutic techniques, as well as technical improvements in laparoscopic ultrasound methods and instrumentation. Not only is IOUS of the pancreas becoming a recognized modality for visualizing and characterizing solid and cystic lesions of the pancreas, but it also has superior lesion detection rates over other non-invasive preoperative imaging modalities. Provisional studies from our department suggest that data from IOUS significantly affects surgical decision making.","1668":"Despite a seemingly increased knowledge about the underlying causes of chronic leg ulcers, their management remains a challenge. Though some ulcers respond to various local treatment options appropriately, others seem to remain unresolved or with a chronic recurrent theme over months to years. The failure to heal these ulcers can be related to the underlying disease process, sometimes lack of patient compliance, and possibly, less than optimal treatment. Even when the exact diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment instituted, many ulcers may, nonetheless, require months of intervention. Certainly, the nonresponsive ulcer is best managed by an appropriate wound biopsy and culture, including a colony count.","1669":"Management of the vast array and sheer volume of clinical data generated during the care of the critically ill patient is a formidable task. Not only must the data be acquired accurately, but it must be retrievable readily and in an interpretable form. Such characteristics are essential features, but the mere uncritical compilation of biomedical data barely takes advantage of the enormous computing power that is available at the bedside. A complete medical informatics package can assist the caregiver with clinical decision making, suggest or even carry out changes in management, and provide continuous, always vigilant surveillance for both dangerous alterations in physiology or ill-advised orders. For optimal implementation, knowledge of the origin, synthesis, and utility of clinical information is essential. A successful implementation using the skills of physicians, nurses, biomedical engineers, computer scientists, and hospital administrators must be collaborative. The characteristics of a clinical information system were defined recently by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences (Table 1). However, even the ideal system, implemented and administered by a harmonious and committed team, will not ensure clinical acceptance. The issue of accessibility can become paramount. If the system is not responsive to the needs of the occasional user, a great deal of expensive hardware will not be used to its full capability.","1670":null,"1671":"Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus are known complications of orthopaedic procedures, par- ticularly about the hip and knee. Spinal surgery has been associated with few thrombotic complications historically. Widespread use of instrumentation in adult patients has lead to a rise in complexity of adult spinal surgery. Length of operative procedures, level of difficulty, and bulk of instrumentation have all in- creased. We have noted an occasional pulmonary embolus in our center, as well as a small incidence of pul- monary embolus in recent reports of adult spine instrumented cases. A consensus conference through the National Institute of Health has estimated that between 300,000and 600,000hospitalized patients develop deep vein thrombosis each year with as many as 50,000 deaths per year occurring secondary to pulmonary embo- Ius.The incidence of thromboembolic disease appears to increase with age as well as with immobilization.' Prolonged rest and prone positioning on frames with compression of femoral veins and iliac veins have been indicated as possible risk factors during spinal surgery.","1672":"Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are important clinical disorders that affect patients in many medical and surgical specialties. In North America, deep vein thrombosis results in hospitalization of up to 600,000patients per year. Pulmonary embolism is also a serious problem that occurs in more than 500,000patients per year, of whom approximately 200,000will die. Almost half of those patients who die will be terminally ill or suffer an incurable disease, but the remainder of the deaths occur in patients who other- wise could have recovered completely.'","1673":"The most common carpal instability is the scapholunate dissociation (carpal instability dissociative: C.I.D.) with dorsal intercalated segment instability (D.I.S.I.), with the most significant element being the flexion of the scaphoid bone (rotary subluxation). Rupture of the scapholunate ligament was formerly believed to be the prerequisite for the dissociation.':' However, three findings contradict this theory\"':","1674":"The first hip replacements of the modern era were performed by Sir John Charnley in 1959,using poly- tetrafluoroethylene for the acetabulum and polymethylmethacrylate cement to secure the stainless steel femoral component. These initial operations were not a success due to excessive wear of the PTFE bearing surface. The operation was not acknowledged to be the success it is today until 1962when Charnley switched to using high-density polyethylene for the acetabular component and the \"low-friction arthroplasty\" was introduced.' This prosthesis has remained the \"gold standard\" until the present day with relatively few changes to the original concept, and with considerable success with published results in excess of 20 years.'","1675":"The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the use of intramedullary nailing for fracture manage- ment. Increased availability of new techniques and instrumentation have contributed to the continuing expansion of applications for intramedullary nailing. The introduction and availability of image intensi- fiers into American hospitals has also led to the popularization of closed intramedullary nailing techniques, and locking nails have expanded the indications of closed intramedullary nailing to unstable long bone frac- tures of the femur, tibia, and humerus. New classes of nails such as the second generation Reconstruction Nail have expanded the use of intramedullary nailing for more proximal femoral fractures. In addition, advances in biomechanical and locking designs have recently led to the use of intramedullary nailing in distal femur fractures and forearm fractures. There is continuing evolution of specialized nails including a self-guiding nail, nails for use in femoral lengthening, and nails used in conjunction with intramedullary osteotomies.","1676":"As humans go through the normal process of aging, there is drooping of many of the deep structures of the eyes. For generations, and continuing today, aesthetic plastic surgeons are removing superficial structures (i.e., skin and fat) as the primary management of drooping upper and lower eyelids. However, the dissatisfaction of patients with the results of these conventional approaches (Fig. 1) has led to further research and the development of innovative techniques that give a more youthful and harmonious appearance to the face.","1677":"Restoration of form and function after composite oro mandibular resections, especially those of the symphysis, is one of the greatest challenges facing the reconstructive surgeon. Loss of the anterior mandibular arch results in serious impairment of oral competence, speech, deglutition, and mastication producing th~ striking cosmetic disfigurement characterized by the \"Andy Gump\" caricature of the 1930s (Fig. l)Y The pathomechanics of this deformity are due to anterior and medial deviation of the lateral mandibular segments by the residual mylohyoid muscles and superior displacement by the medial pterygoid, masseter, and temporalis muscles. In comparison, these deforming forces are relatively absent following lateral mandibulectomy. Prevention of the \"Andy Gump\" deformity and its sequelae is paramount and often mandates composite replacement of bone, skin and mucosa. Additionally, through-and-through lateral or posterior defects requiring trilaminar replacement of skin, bone and mucosa or long bone gaps crossing the midline with massive soft tissue losses pose formidable reconstructive challenges.","1678":"There is currently a great deal of interest in endoscopy in the field of neurosurgery. Given that the central nervous system is bathed in a clear fluid, the brain and spine have always seemed perfect environments \"inwhich to use endoscopes, and attempts have been made to do so since the early years of the century. The delicacy of the maneuvers required, the size of the endoscopes, and the rapid advances in other forms of neurosurgical technology all served to hamper the development of this field, until recently. Endoscopes with diameters ofless than 1mm are now available, as are endoscopes with irrigation and working channels in ad- dition to a degree of controlled flexibility as small as 2.3 mm.The only limits to the greater use of endoscopes in the brain are human ingenuity and human expertise-arguably infinite resources.","1679":"The use of the operating microscope revolutionized neurosurgery. The illumination and magnification al- lowed visualization of the desired area of the brain with much less retraction on normal brain. Microinstrumentation flourished. Various lasers and ultrasonic aspirators were adopted.","1680":"Despite improvements in surgical practice and postoperative care, the large transperitoneal approaches used in elective aortic reconstructive surgery are still associated with a relatively high perioperative morbidity and mortality rate, even in patients who are good risks for undergoing aortic surgery.,,2This perioperative morbidity is partly caused by major surgical trauma.","1681":"Spinal cord protection is of extreme importance to avoid the catastrophic complication of paraplegia related to surgery for thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic disease.P-' Spinal cord injury from surgi- cally induced ischemia for aortic surgery has a variable risk of paraplegia. The incidence of spinal cord injury varies extensively-aneurysms of the proximal descending thoracic aorta and thoracoabdominal aorta 3% to 35%;to repair of traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta performed with simple cross-clamping with- out distal perfusion, 25%;to repair of acute type B dissections of the thoracoabdominal aorta, as high as 35%.","1682":"Minimally invasive techniques have been gaining popularity in all fields of surgery. Their application to vascular surgery has spawned advances in endovascular treatment of aneurysmal and atherosclerotic arterial disease. These procedures are dependent on various imaging modalities, including angiogra- phy, intravascular ultrasound, and computerized tomography scanning to choose appropriate candidates and devices, and to assure precise en doluminal treatment. No single imaging method is adequate for all aspects of endovascular surgery; however, an algorithmic approach may judiciously reduce the inherent inaccuracy and morbidity associated with current methods.","1683":"Based on the concept of endoluminal aneurysm exclusion, we began to develop a plan for endovascular treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 1976.Two prototypes have been developed and were marked by a high failure rate.' The first was a thin fabric graft mounted on a metallic cage-like structure composed by a self-expandable mesh with a zigzag configuration. The apparatus was compressed inside a tubular sheath, which acted as a vessel introducer and carrier. Experiments in normal canine aor- tas led to the abandonment of this prototype due to an inconsistent deployment of the metallic cage. The radial expansion properties of the cage were difficult to control and predict. Over-expansion resulted in aortic wall injury and subsequent rupture. Controversially, underexpansion led to leakage of blood be- tween the apparatus and the host aorta with subsequent device migrations. The second prototype involved a Dacron graft fitted on a Silastic bag with a cylindrical lumen, which could be distended by injection of silicone into the bag. Unfortunately, this method was associated with prompt graft thrombosis of the aorta in all experimental essays.","1684":"Interventional cardiology has undergone exciting changes since the first percutaneous transluminal coro-_ nary angioplasty was performed by Andreas Gruentzig in 1977.' Over the last several years, a variety of techniques have been developed which provide the interventional cardiologist with a range of options to treat coronary stenoses. In addition, the indications for intervention have radically changed since the original work by Gruentzig, who limited treatment to patients with a single focal stenosis in a large vessel. Advances in balloon angioplasty, as well as the development of new techniques such as directional atherectomy, laser angioplasty, rotational atherectomy, extraction atherectomy, and now intracoronary stents have given the interventional cardiologist the ability to treat multivessel disease, increasingly complex lesions, and less stable patients.\"","1685":"Three isoforms of endothelin (ET) exist, ET-l, ET-2,and ET-3.Nucleotide sequences for the three human ET genes are highly conserved. ET-l exactly matches the sequence ofET originally isolated from the condi- tioned medium of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs).\"All three forms have been found in vascular, neural, adrenal, and kidney tissue, but are expressed in different proportions. Endothelial cells ex- clusively produce ETAll three isoforms have different vasoconstrictive potencies but are otherwise quali- tatively similar. ET-2 is the most potent vasoconstrictor, followed by ET-l and ET.","1686":"Inthe past three decades, the prevalence of aortic aneurysms has increased threefold. Incidence of aortic aneurysms increases with age and as the population ages, the prevalence increases. Population-based stud- ies have shown that 10% of men over the age of 70 have abdominal aortic aneurysms. After many years of research, the exact pathogenesis of degenerative aneurysms-the most common form of aneurysm-is still unknown, although a number of factors including genetic, protelytic enzymes, hemodynamics, inflammation, and infection have been implicated.","1687":"Sonographic examinations of the female mammary gland within the frameworks of the diagnosis of breast cancer playa fundamental role in the early detection of benign and, in particular, of malignant growths. Sonographic blood flow determinations can be used as an auxiliary noninvasive examination method. This is based on the fact that malignomas differ from benign tumors in that they display a pathological increase in vascular-ization. These changes of the circulatory conditions can be utilized in the diagnosis of the dignity of breast cancer.","1688":"The RIGS system is a technology which was developed to provide a more sensitive and accurate method of detecting colorectal cancer during surgery. One of the components of this system is the hand-held, gamma-detecting probe [Neoprobe Model 1000instrument; Neoprobe Corporation, Dublin, Ohio), used by the surgeon to identify preadministered, radiolabeled monoclonal antibody which has localized to dis- eased tissue. RIGSuses sound-directed gamma detection to identify and locate cancer which may not be seen or felt by the surgeon. The success of RIGS has been largely due to the remarkable sensitivity of the gamma- detecting probe in detecting small amounts oflow-energy radioactivity. This attribute has led to the use of the probe for other surgical applications including pre- and intraoperative lymphatic mapping, and parathyroid localization. Surgery for melanoma, breast cancer, parathyroid disease, and colorectal cancer has been af- fected by the increased use of the gamma-detecting probe both in clinical trials and practice. This chapter will review the many applications of this new technology.","1689":"Surgical biopsy of the breast has long been the most commonly accepted method of determining the na- ture of a clinical or mammographic abnormality. Because this method carries with it certain cost and morbidity drawbacks, physicians have investigated less invasive alternatives. Until recently, however, there has not been sufficient confidence in the minimally invasive techniques to supplant surgical breast biopsy. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the breast has been available for decades and, in some hands, per- formed reliably enough to avoid surgical biopsy in certain instances. For the most part, however, surgeons and other physicians have been reluctant to base definitive decision making upon the results of FNA.This is un- derstandable in that FNA carries significant insufficient tissue and false negative rates.\"l As a result, FNA frequently represented an additional test and attendant cost without obviating the need for surgical biopsy.","1690":"Dedrick et al. published a mathematical model in 1978 that described the theoretical rationale for in- traperitoneal administration of chemotherapeutic agents.' Numerous authors have provided substantial clinical and experimental evidence supporting Dedrick's model. Lukas et al.' and Torres et al.' have de- scribed the pharmacokinetics involved in the transport of drugs from the peritoneal cavity into the portal and systemic circulation. These investigations and others gave birth to the pharmacologic concept known as the peritoneal plasma barrier (PPB). The PPB has been described as a complex diffusion barrier, consisting of the endothelium, the mesothelium, and the intervening interstitium, along with the fluid in the blood and the dialysate.t This physiologic barrier limits the resorption of hydrophilic drugs such as mitomycinC, doxoru- bicin, and cisplatin from the peritoneal cavity into the blood.","1691":"Activated T cells playa central role in the rejection of histoincompatible organ allografts. Studies of trans- membrane signaling requirements ofT cells, by identifying molecular and cellular mechanisms ofT-cell activation, can lead to rational therapeutic strategies for the regulation of the anti-allograft response. A clear consensus exists that the primary signal for T-cell activation is generated as a consequence of the in- teractions among the T-cell receptor for antigen (TCR)I cluster designation 3 (CD3) complex and the antigenic peptide presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins expressed on the sur- face of the antigen-presenting cells (APCs). '-7 The TCR\/CD3-dependent signaling is necessary but insufficient in itself to fully activate normal human primary (quiescent) T cells, and additional costimulatory signals are required for full activatiori.","1692":null,"1693":null,"1694":"Undescended testis or cryptorchidism remains a common condition. It affects 1% of individuals! and is treated by pediatric surgeons, urologists, and general surgeons depending on the age of the patient, spe- cialist services, and expertise available. Laparoscopy has been used for the localization of impalpable testis for more than 15years. However, minimal access surgery has now made its impact in this field of surgery in terms of surgical intervention. It is used not only for the localization of undescended testis but also to per- form Iaparosco'pic orchidectomy\/ and both stages of the Foweler-Stevens orchiopexyY Minimal access surgery is also used for the ligation of the testicular vein for var-icocele.' The clinical anatomy of the unde- scended testis and varicocele is interrelated and therefore is dealt with in the same chapter, although there is no association between the two clinical conditions.","1695":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common medical problems encountered in the United States. For many years, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic BPH. In recent times, newer modalities of treatment in the form of drugs (a- blockers, LHRH-agonist, anti-androgens, 5 a-reductase inhibitors), microwave hyperthermia, prostatic stents, balloon urethroplasty, laser prostatectomy, and most recently High Intensity Focal Ultrasound (HIFU) and Trans Urethral Needle Ablation (TUNA) are challenging TURP as the gold standard therapy for BPH. Today, laser prostatectomy holds a special place in therapy of BPH, as it is easy to perform, safe to apply with a vastly improved patient compliance, and is the first choice in certain special circumstances, e.g., patients on anticoagulants. In this chapter we discuss the present status of laser prostatectomy for BPH.","1696":"Laparoscopy has been a valuable tool in gynecologic practice for many years but it is only recently that this technology has been applied to urological surgery.1 Initially laparoscopy was used in urology only for di- agnostic purposes; however, following the success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy,' the technique was utilized to perform therapeutic procedures such as varicocelectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.v' Open surgery has been the standard for nephrectomy for over 100 years and the techniques, results, and complica- tions have been well documented in surgical texts. Laparoscopic nephrectomy is also a relatively new appli- cation, having only been first described in 1991.5 This article will review the current status of laparoscopic nephrectomy and speculate on its future role. The pros and cons of the laparoscopic technique when com- pared to open nephrectomy will also be discussed.","1697":"The principal reason for employing an optical trocar has been described by Kaali.' The potential clinical benefits of a visually directed trocar entry system have been identified in a follow-up clinical series. 2 Current experience with the commercially developed Endopath Opt.iview\" trocar has suggested an ad- ditional surgical advantage through an enhanced abdominal wall stability of the trocar sheath. The purpose of the current investigation was to determine whether or not this clinical observation could be mechanically quantified.","1698":"A laparoscopic method for resecting benign ovarian cysts has been devised and involves excising the cyst wall extraperitoneally after aspirating the cystic fluid. In this report, the technique and clinical results are described and mini-laparotomy which is used in this technique is discussed. A total of 104patients were treated by this method. The diagnosis was simple cyst in 46,dermoid cyst in 33,and chocolate cyst in 25. The method was successful in 90 patients (87%).The remaining 14(14%)were converted to open surgery, 9 be- cause of severe adhesions. The remaining 5 patients had various complications: malignancy, bladder injury, dermoid content too solid to aspirate, and bleeding. We found endometrioid adenocarcinoma in 1 patient whose chocolate cyst could be removed completely.","1699":"In  the last two years intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has become frequently employed as an assisted reproductive technique primarily to treat male factor infertility.' In order to achieve high pregnancy rates, all assisted reproductive technologies including ICSI require sufficient number and quality oocytes. In our practice we use three different ovulation induction regimens (CC\/hMG, GnRH-a\/hMG, and GnRH-a\/FSH) to maximize the number of oocytes available for fertilization. In this present report, we retrospectively com- pared pregnancy rates with ICSI following the use of these protocols.","1700":"In many surgical centers the intra-abdominal morcellation of IS-cm myomas' or freely dissected organs such as krdrieys\" has become routine. A prerequisite is the availability of a macro-morcellator which re- duces the tissue bulk to a small enough size that it may be removed through the standard abdominal tro- cars in a reasonable amount of time.","1701":"Advantages of.laparoscopiC cholecystectomy (LC) in terms of shorter hospital stay, less pain, and diminished disabilrty are well documented. Less well documented are the long-term comptications of this procedure. We report a patient who developed obstructive jaundice 8 months following LC from a spilled gallstone. In our review of the literature using MEDLINE from January 1990to June 1995,we did not find this complication reported.","1702":"The incidence of mesenteric cysts is relatively uncommon. Sprague\" examined its frequency and noted that five large hospitals located in the LosnAngeles area averaged one documented case of mesenteric cyst per 100,000 hospital admissions. The most common location appears to be the mesentery of the small bowel, especially that of the ileum. Cysts of the mesentery of the large bowel are somewhat less fre- quent, accounting for approximately 38% of the total incidence. Those involving the large bowel most commonly involve the mesentery of the sigmoid colon.","1703":"Early stages of rectal cancer, well and ~oderately differentiated, have a l~w r~te of regional spread a~d therefore may be treated by conservative therapy. 1-3 Transanal Bnrloscopic MIcrosurgery (TEM)was In- troduced into clinical practice' by G. Buess in 1983.This technique allows for the local treatment of be- nign lesions and the early stages of rectal cancer through a modified rectoscope, yielding good exposure of the operative field with-three-dimensional vision; mucosectomy and full thickness excision procedures can be performed. TEM benefits are the same as other minimally invasive techniques: less pain, reduced morbid- ity, faster recovery time, and an absence of skin scars. In the present paper, the authors report the technique and the results of the experience of 89TEM procedures for the treatment of rectal tumors.","1704":"Laparoscopic surgery has been widely applied not only in cholecystectomy but also in gastrointestinal operations. In previous reports the authors proposed their original operative technique, laparoscopic intragastric surgery (LIGS),' in which all trocars and surgical instruments are inserted directly into the gastric lumen to perform the resection of mucosal or' submucosal lesions of the stomach. The purpose of this article is to introduce laparoscopic gastrotomy as a new technique for removing early gastric cancer by LIGS.","1705":"Blind insertion of the Veressneedle and the conventional primary trocar have remained troublesome steps during laparoscopic surgical procedures. The standard primary trocar can be inserted directly without preexisting pneumoperitoneum, thus avoiding use of the Veressneedle. This approach still requires blind insertion, and inadvertent traumatic injuries have been reported.' Complications from such trocar insertions can be severe and at times lethal. Although the rate of such complications is acknowledged to be small, the ab- solute number becomes a relevant public health issue in light ofthe high frequency of both operative and di- agnostic laparoscopic procedures worldwide. Traumatic injuries to vessels, bowel, and other abdominal or- gans continue to occur despite proper surgical training, operator experience, and use of up-to-date equipment.","1706":"Morbid obesity is a serious disease that is responsible for several co-morbid conditions. Increased risks of hypertension, adult onset diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, pulmonary disease (Pickwickian syn- drome), musculo-skeletal disorders, gallbladder disease, deep vein thrombosis, venous stasis ulcers, and increased prevalence of certain types of cancers (uterine, breast, colon carcinoma) have been reported, ( together with severe psychological and social disability.' Nonsurgical treatment options including various combinations oflow-calorie or very-low-calorie diets, behavior modification, exercise, and drug therapy may achieve acceptable transient weight reduction but fail to maintain reduced body weight in most patients.'","1707":"Gastrofiberscopy is suitable not only for diagnostics, but for the therapy of benign gastric polyp and early gastric cancer as well. Surgery is necessary if endoluminal ultrasonography cannot exclude the extension of early gastric cancer to the submucosa or if, because of a recurrent or giant polyp, gastrofiberscopic polypectomy is unsuccessful.","1708":"Thoraco-Iaparoscopic surgery presents a series of technical difficulties linked mainly to the necessity of acquiring proper motor coordination and spatial reconstruction of an operative field that is seen from a distance on a two-dimensional video monitor, in the absence of any direct tactile feedback. In an effort to improve the motor coordination of the operating surgeon and of the surgical team, many apparatuses have recently become available on the market that allow the reproduction of a 3-Dimage on a video monitor. Such apparatuses have technical characteristics that are substantially diverse in technology and provide signifi- cantly different end results.","1709":"Reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach is a normal physiological event occurring most commonly at night' but also in the fasting and postprandial daytime periods.' Previously, the terms \"bile reflux\" and \"alkaline reflux\" have been used to describe this process. However, duodenal contents contain more  than just \"bile\" and studies have shown that the term \"alkaline reflux\" is a misnomer since pH &gt; 7 does not correlate with reflux of duodenal contents.' Therefore, duodenogastroesophageal reflux (DGER) may be a more appropriate term to describe the pathological regurgitation of duodenal contents through the pylorus into the stomach with subsequent reflux into the esophagus.","1710":"The present trend in laparoscopic surgery is to make use of the Veress needle as an instrument for palpation of the abdominal cavity to secure \"safe\" blind introduction of the first trocar. The oxymoron is witness to the many mishaps experienced by the most daring surgeons who approach blindly each and every abdomen, irrespective of previous surgery. The \"bayonet technique\" heralded by the gynecological school oflaparoscopy has never been accepted by us, due to its inherent characteristic risk of injuries to the pelvic or retroperitoneal organs. Whenever the patient has had previous abdomino-pelvic surgery, the open laparoscopy technique is preferred with the Hasson's trocar either at the navel or at any other location, as deemed appropriate by the site of old incisions. Experience and laparoscopic findings have led us to enforce the principle that open laparoscopy should be instituted if any scar, even from previous Iaparoscopy, is present over the anterior abdominal wall. A variation in the technique for introduction of the Veress needle and safe execution of the pneumoperitoneum was devised to be used when the peritoneal cavity has not been violated surgically.","1711":"The worldwide explosion of Iaparoscopic surgery within general surgery began in the late 1980sand early 1990s.From its inception, surgeons have expected the image on the video monitor to resemble closely the . image obtained in similar open surgery.The monitor image, however, is presented in two dimensions- height and width. Orientation of the surgeon to the anatomy is more difficult and requires a sound knowl- edge of anatomy, the relationships of organs to each other, and an understanding of the individual patient's unique structures. Adding a third dimension, depth, to imitate natural vision in open surgery may provide surgeons with the confidence to perform more advanced procedures. In addition, trainee surgeons, without the experience of open surgery which their senior colleagues have gained, may more rapidly appreciate orientation of the anatomy and learn the surgical task more quickly.","1712":"The subject of the economic considerations involved in using disposable versus reusable instrumentation has become a controversial issue.The economic evaluations performed purely by economists may not ap- peal to the surgeon and may not be applicable in different parts of the world. The quality of disposable instruments and their convenience in laparoscop'ic surgery is not at issue; the controversy, instead, centers on the question of the cost-effectiveness of disposable equipment. High-quality instruments enable safe, sue- cessful operations.' Some instruments are not available in reusable form and the quality of some reusable in- struments (e-g-, laparoscopic scissors) is sometimes questionable, particularly as they are periodically in need of servicing or repair. For a routine cholecystectomy, clips can be mounted on a reusable applier to ligate the cystic duct and artery. This can save considerable cost. However, disposable clips and their appliers should be available in the operating room (OR) in case of emergencies such as uncontrolled bleeding.","1713":"Ultrasonography has been an integral part of gynecology and general surgery in recent years. New technology has allowed this modality to be extended to include intraoperative assessment through a laparoscopic approach. This allows more accurate imaging with higher resolution than previously attainable. Combining the ultrasonic and visual images on the monitor screen simultaneously (picture in a picture) allows a further dimension of information which can modify surgical direction. The equipment used by the author is described and clinical experience discussed. Further clinical applications are considered and the prac- ticality of the methodology assessed.","1714":"The history of the development ofthefine art of physical examination is a record of the physician's efforts to pry ever deeper and deeper into the inner recesses of his patients (H. V.Findlay, 1937).The Iaparoscopic revolution or evolution caught the surgical field by surprise. Just a few years earlier, the term \"endoscopic surgery\" was not part of the vocabulary of most surgeons. As with all breakthroughs, the incorporation of laparoscopy into surgery posed its own set of challenges, including: (1) the growing significance of economic factors, (2) increasing pressure from industry, (3) a shift from the hospital to out-patient settings, (4) a different approach to surgical training, (5) changes in the surgeon-patient relationship, and (6) a range of ethical issues.","1715":null,"1716":"The main direction in modern imaging is increasing the spatial resolution and selectivity for pathology\npattern recognition at the microscale. Dynamic optical imaging (DOl) has enormous potential in the selectivity\nof description of living tissue state at cellular and subcellular levels. However, multiple light\nscattering creates considerable difficulties in revealing the tissue microstructure in its depth. On the other\nhand, along with changes in the microstructure, pathology should also manifest itself in the integral macroscopic\npattern of the tissue. Actually, living tissue, as a distributed active media with well-developed reception\nand self-regulation, is characterized by a high spatial synergy. In such a media, even morphologically\nsmall pathology could disturb tissue functioning in a rather extended area. As a result, after some definite\ntime, a diffuse \"field\" of the pathological phenomena appears even in the morphological image. Since optical\ncontrast is determined by tissue components (such as blood), which actively participate in physiological functioning,\nthe distributed functional pattern of the tissue is reflected in optical images in the form of spatiotemporal\nmodulation of the optical density. This observation opens up the possibility of investigating the diffuse\npattern of the pathology at the functional stage of its development, even before the actual appearance of\nnoticeable morphological changes .","1717":"The number of individuals infected by the human immunodeficiency virus type-l (HIV) continues to\nincrease on a worldwide basis.' A significant percentage, ifnot all, of these individuals will eventually\ndevelop the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).2 While horizontal transmission in the\nhomosexual population may be contained or decreasing,' heterosexual transmission and infection through\ncontaminated blood supplies continues to increase: Additionally, vertical transmission from infected females\nto their fetuses is also on the rise with a resultant increase in the number of children with AIDS.S New\nstrategies, therefore, must be devised in order to limit more effectively the spread of this virus.","1718":"Mortality after surgery in patients with severe and progressive anemia is an entity': risks related to\nblood loss and insufficient oxygen delivery to tissues are still a major concern in surgery. Risks of\nblood transfusion parallel those of blood loss: blood-borne infectious diseases and immunological\nside effects' may frustrate therapeutic efforts of surgery. Thus, blood transfusion in surgery must be kept to a\nlevel in which both risks are reduced to a minimum (or theoretically even absent). This review will deal with\ntwo relevant questions: (a) how to define the lowest amount of blood tranifusion needed for sur8ery and (b) how to\nreduce or abolish post-tranifusion risks of this amount.","1719":"The proliferation of medical tec'hnology, including prescription drugs, devices, and procedures, is often\nperceived in the current managed healthcare environment as a threat to the ability of managed care\norganizations to control healthcare costs. However, the ongoing need for new technologies and innovations\nin medical care demands that we look beyond the cost of developing and acquiring such technologies\nto the outcomes being achieved with the resources invested. We need to document not only costs and\/or\nclinical outcomes related to such technologies and interventions, but also measures such as cost effectiveness, patient quality of life, and patient satisfaction. Outcomes research is the therm given to the assesment of such measures.","1720":"It ould seem to most casual observers that the task of technology assessment would fall naturally on the\nsurgeon. After all, does our training and livelihood not depend on technology? Furthermore, as \"procedure-\noriented\" physicians (in contrast to our \"cognitive\" colleagues as described by Hsiao'), we are closer\nto the technologies that require assessment and thus better suited for their evaluation. It is hoped that the alltoo-\nnarrow and incomplete focus presented in the above will become evident in this article, as my intent is to\ndescribe what technology assessment in health care involves and to stress that its application is a complex and\nvery involved process. Its scope is extremely broad, often quite expensive, and especially for the surgeon\nrequires the advice and input of non-surgeons.","1721":"Recently, there has been increasing interest among anesthesiologists in the responses to surgical stress because\nsurgical procedures have become more and more invasive. While the responses are natural and\nprotective in themselves, they may have adverse consequences for the patients. There have been many\ninvestigations suggesting that anesthetic techniques such as spinal and epidural analgesia may alter the endocrine\nresponse. Some measures which block inflammatory reaction are reported to allow modulation of\nthe response.' In the present study preemptive analgesia for postoperative pain using spinal and extradural\nblockade, and pre-treatment of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin were applied to patients\nresponses were assessed.","1722":"In the last few years there has been increasing interest in the development of 3-D display in medical imaging\ntechniques. 3-D imaging is capable of enhancing the anatomic information of the images. This technique\nfacilitates the localization of normal and pathologic structures and the understanding of spatial relationships.\nComputer reconstructed 3-D VIews of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) have improved image interpretation by clinicians especially in reconstructive and orthopaedic\nsurgery. Although the advantageous features of 3-D display are well recognized for radiologic\nimaging methods, 3-D data acquisition in ultrasonography has not yet found broad clinical acceptance. This\nhas been mainly due to the lack of hardware appropriate for clinical use and the time required for data processing\nof high resolution 3-D images.

Unfortunately, physicians, and surgeons in particular, continue to order too many antibiotics too often, and for too long. Optimal use of antibiotics, as for any therapeutic modality, requires consideration of the risks and benefits as- sociated with available agents and regimens. Although the desired benefit is always successful eradication or avoidance of offending pathogens, the best way to acheive that goal may not be obvious. Decisions regarding choice of antimicrobial agent, duration of therapy, and route of administration are primarily based upon an- ticipation of clinical efficacy.","1725":"What is economic credentialing? The California Medical Association defines economic credentialing as follows: \"The use of economic criteria that do not apply to quality for granting or renewing medical staff pr ivileges?\" The American Medical Association defines economic credentialing as \" ... the use of economic criteria unrelated to quality of care or professional competency in determining an individual's qualification for initial or continuing hospital medical staff membership or pr-ivileges?\" The Florida Medical Association defines economic credentialing as \" ... any practice that denies access to hospitals based on eco- nomic criteria unrelated to the clinical qualifications or professional responsibilities of the physician.\" It also defines economic credentialing as \" ... fiscal responsibility in practicing quality healthcare,\" and specifically notes that the governing body of a hospital has the right to discipline physicians (and presumably, exclude them) on the basis of resource utilization.","1726":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is now a routine procedure used to relieve pain and restore function. The results of the procedure depend on several factors: implant positioning, bone implant fixation, bone stock, and restoration of a physiological musculo-articular unit. The prosthesis may be cemented or used without cement. In the latter case, mechanical stability relies on implant fit and fill to reduce micromotion and ensure long-term fixation. This fixation is usually enhanced by surface coating of the stem. While the goal of THA is routinely reached in common osteoarthritis, it is often more difficult when the anatomy of the hip is modified. In these cases, fit can be achieved by designing a stem adapted to the modified anatomy to provide optimal stress transfer.","1727":"In the past the evaluation of treatment modalities of calcaneal fractures has been fraught with the lack of well-designed, randomized clinical studies. As a result, surgeons treating these injuries were typically polarized when deciding between a surgical or nonsurgical approach to management. Among the many technical reasons for the frank dichotomy of treatment preferences were the difficulty in anatomical restoration, the relatively poor surgical access to the calcaneus, the limited internal fixation devices available for stabilization, and the difficulty in comprehensive radiographic imaging. Furthermore, the lack of complete understanding of the mechanism of sequential bony failure complicated the surgical exercise. The lack of standardized protocols for surgical treatment also lended to the controversy.","1728":"Thromboembolic disease is a potentially fatal complication after high-risk orthopaedic surgery such as total joint arthroplasty and major trauma. Without prophylaxis, pulmonary embolism is known to occur in 1% to 2% of hospitalized patients. Pneumatic foot compression devices have recently been developed to increase lower extremity circulation and, as a result, are effective in thromboembolic disease prophylaxis. Recent studies in total hip and total knee arthroplasty have documented a statistically significant reduction in deep venous thrombosis using these devices. Interestingly, studies utilizing pneumatic foot compression have demonstrated a reduction in lower extremity edema both postoperatively and after significant lower extremity trauma. Pneumatic foot compression appears to be more applicable than the previous mechanical devices, and as a result, compliance appears to have improved.","1729":"Trapezio metacarpal joint (TMJ) arthritis depends on various etiologies including joint laxity, repetitive stresses, hypoplasia of the trapezium bone, and musculotendinous anomalies. The anatomy of the musculotendinous insertions described in textbooks is found very seldom in reality. Only in 2 cases out of 100 hand dissections did we find 1 abductor pollicis longus (APL) tendon. The number of tendons of the first wrist compartment averaged more than four, in different arrangements.","1730":"An isolated posterior cruciate ligament injury is a difficult clinical and surgical problem. Most authors agree that multidirectional rotatory instability of a knee resulting from either medial or lateral ligamentous laxity in combination with a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury requires surgical stabilization. However, indications for surgical reconstruction of an isolated posterior cruciate ligament injury still remain controversial. This lack of agreement over the surgical indications for this injury appears to stem from a lack of clear understanding of the natural course of PCL-deficient knee, and current limitations in surgical technique to reproduce posterior stability in a predictable fashion.","1731":"Alopecia-reducing procedures were first introduced to the field of cosmetic hair restoration surgery in 1977 and have advanced to the point that large areas of baldness can be treated very effectively and expeditiously (Fig. 1). The most aggressive of the alopecia-reducing procedures is called scalp-lifting (undermining down to the hairline of the nape) (Fig. 2) and consists of the lateral lift (Fig. 3a), the bilateral occipitoparietal lift (Fig. 3b), and the bitemporal lift (Fig. 3c). These procedures are usually used to correct posterior baldness while hair grafts are used for frontal hairline restoration (Fig. 3d). Although incredible results can occur with this methodology, it is not without its difficulties. One of the most formidable of these problems is slot formation with divergent hair direction. This problem can develop after multiple alopeciareducing procedures are carried through (Fig. 4). In an excellent study performed by Nordstrom in 1983, he demonstrated that the total length of the bald area increases by approximately 10% of its total length with each progressive operation. This increased length in the posterior region can cause a severe cosmetic deformity, especially in patients who are extensively bald and have had several of these procedures.","1732":"The surgical treatment of breast cancer has changed dramatically in the last 30 years. The era of the Halsted radical mastectomy has passed, and less deforming surgeries have come into use. Partial mastectomy in association with axillary lymph node dissection has become a viable alternative for stage 1 and 2 carcinomas; more advanced tumors may be treated with breast conservative surgery when neoadjuvant chemotherapy is utilized. Further, the use of mammography in screening for breast cancer has led to an increase in the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), another lesion for which breast conservation is often indicated.","1733":"Replantation of fingers, hands, feet, and extremities has become a relatively common procedure. There are a number of reports of successful replants of facial parts. Since the feeding vessels are extremely small, these replants are most challenging. Venous outflow is the most common problem, and leeches and anticoagulants are commonly needed, resulting in considerable blood loss and transfusions. Nonetheless, the successful replantation of a facial part yields an aesthetic and functional result far superior to any other reconstructive option. We review our experience with 7 scalps, 4 ears, and 2 lips.","1734":"Currently, one of the most exciting areas of growth in neurosurgery involves neuroendoscopy. As in the fields of general, gynecologic, orthopaedic, thoracic, and urologic surgery, neurosurgeons are exploring the utility of the endoscope and its changing technology. The use of endoscopes in neurosurgery is actually not new. In 1920 Mixter first reported using one to treat a hydrocephalic child. The early scopes suffered from poor illumination and the need for the surgeon to look directly through the scope, using it in a manner similar to a telescope. In the 1950s this changed with significant advances in endoscopic optics. Harold Hopkins, a professor of applied optical physics, improved the conventional solid glass rod lens system with a resulting improvement in the scope's image. He also developed coherent fiber bundle technology which made the flexible endoscope possible. These advances, coupled with better diagnostic testing (CT and MR scanning) and the miniaturization of video cameras, have resulted in the current explosion of interest in neuroendoscopy.","1735":"Classic craniotomy for biopsy or resection of intra-axial brain tumors usually employed large skin flaps and craniotomy openings. These were necessary so that surgeons could be certain that a subcortical tumor could be localized and that the extent of the lesion lay somewhere beneath and within the limits of the craniotomy. Localization methods for classic resection methods were qualitative and imprecise.","1736":"Present surgical education relies on a combination of observation, peer review, and practice on cadavers, and animals. In contrast, simulation technology, known as virtual reality, offers the ability to practice, hands-on surgical procedures in computer models that exhibit physical and physiological characteristics of living humans.","1737":"Multiple approaches are available to the surgeon who wishes to reduce patient exposure to the risks of allogeneic blood transfusion. These range from transfusion of the patient's own blood through red cell salvage and reinfusion to the use of drugs such as iron and erythropoietin to restore red cell mass. Transfusion need in surgery is clearly tied to blood loss; it follows that reduction of operative blood loss should minimize the need for transfusion. All surgeons are taught according to Halstedian principles of gentle tissue handling and anatomic dissection, techniques designed in part to reduce intraoperative bleeding. Our increased knowledge about the risks of allogeneic blood has prompted many surgeons to analyze and to revise standard approaches to surgical procedures and\/or to develop innovative techniques in an attempt to reduce or eliminate blood loss and transfusion. This brief report will focus on such recent efforts.","1738":"The field of vascular surgery is facing an important crossroads. Increasingly, less invasive alternatives are becoming available for the treatment of vascular lesions previously amenable only to conventional operative repair. Endovascular devices and techniques have been developed in experimental and clinical settings in an attempt to reduce the morbidity and mortality seen with conventional treatments and provide for long-term function at reduced costs. One such device is the transluminally placed endovascular graft which has been used at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York to treat patients with a wide variety of vascular pathologies, including abdominal and peripheral aneurysms, aortoiliac and infrainguinal atherosclerotic occlusive lesions, and lesions of traumatic or iatrogenic origin. This work represents our initial results with the endoluminally deployed stented graft in 92 patients with 102 arterial lesions treated over a 30-month period.","1739":"Aclear relationship between the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) and elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been established. The benefits of reducing LDL-C on cardiac and overall mortality have also been shown. The second report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel has recommended an LDL-C goal of 100 mg\/dL in patients with CAD. Accordingly, cholesterol lowering has become an important strategy for reducing the incidence and progression of CAD.","1740":"Synthetic vascular grafts perform satisfactorily as large caliber (e.g., aortoiliac) arterial substitutes but commonly fail when employed in small diameter and low flow applications. It is likely that prosthetic grafts in humans do not become endothelialized except for a few centimeters from each anastomosis. The lack of an endothelial lining has been postulated as an important factor contributing to the poor patency rates of prosthetic bypass grafts placed in the distal arterial circulation. Increased appreciation of the diverse functions of endothelium in maintaining vascular homeostasis, coupled with improved techniques for in vitro cultivation of human endothelial cells (ECs), spawned efforts to employ endothelium to produce a less thrombogenic inner lining for vascular prostheses.","1741":"Revascularization of the ischemic foot remains a significant challenge for even the most experienced vascular surgeons. Lower extremity revascularization can be accomplished by endarterectomy, endovascular techniques, or bypass. In experienced hands, excellent results have been reported with endarterectomy. However, this technique has limited application because of the diffuse nature of infrainguinal atherosclerotic disease. Endovascular techniques, such as atherectomy and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty, gained enormous popularity initially because they were less invasive than standard techniques. Unfortunately, the long-term results with these techniques have been disappointing.","1742":"It has been recognized for over three decades that tissue hypoperfusion is associated with the appearance of increased levels of iron in the plasma. Experimental observations have documented the liberation of iron into the circulation following reperfusion of ischemic myocardium and small intestine, and into the urine following renal ischemia-reperfusion. Similarly, we have recently demonstrated that iron is delocalized during ischemia of skeletal muscle, via a process which persists upon reperfusion. Other studies have demonstrated delocalization of iron in the parenchyma of postischemic brain, myocardium, and kidney.","1743":"Prior to the mid-1980s, nitric oxide (NO) was viewed as an environmental pollutant but not as a compound of physiological significance. Thus, it was a skeptical audience that first heard the pronouncement at a scientific meeting in 1986, that NO was the identity of the elusive endothelium-derived relaxing factor, a mediator of vasorelaxation in response to numerous endogenous stimuli. Since then, the simple gas NO has gone from obscurity to center stage, being identified as a key player in physiologic processes as diverse as blood pressure maintenance, neural transmission, and immunologic defense. In addition to its physiological roles, NO has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a multitude of disease states, many of which are of primary interest to the cardiovascular surgeon: circulatory shock, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recent years has seen NO biology emerge as an exciting and extremely fertile area of biomedical investigation. To fully understand the molecular basis of many clinical problems facing the cardiovascular surgeon, appreciation of NO's involvement is essential.","1744":"Accumulation of data through prospective studies has seemed painstakingly slow, but during the past 25 years several major prospective studies have published results conclusively demonstrating that carotid endarterectomy is superior to medical management in certain categories of patients with carotid stenosis. These prospective studies are as follows: (1) the Joint Study of Extracranial Arterial Occlusion; (2) the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET); (3) the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST); (4) the V.A. Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial; and (5) the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS).","1745":"Extracranial cerebrovascular disease (ECVD) is a major contributor to cerebrovascular accidents in the modern era. Cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) are the third leading cause of death in the United States with 500,000 new or recurrent CVAs each year. Approximately 15,000 people die annually as a direct result of a stroke resulting in a cost of approximately $18 billion when hospital charges and loss of productivity figures are tabulated. The social and economic impact of this disease mandates a unified approach to its management.","1746":"The diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has been established with increasing frequency during the past two decades. This is probably due to the aging of the population as well as to the extensive use of ultrasonography and computerized tomography (CT) scanning for different pathologies. Although AAA may occasionally cause distal embolization, rupture remains the most common and deadly complication. Elective replacement with a synthetic graft has proved to be the most appropriate method to prevent AAA rupture for nearly 40 years, and at respected medical centers, it has been associated with a postoperative mortality of less than 5%. Non-fatal complications occur with some regularity irrespective of the setting in which the operation is performed. Increasingly, vascular surgeons are encountering older patients with severe co-morbid conditions. This can increase operative morbidity and may even elevate mortality of aortic surgery to a figure in excess of 60%. It seems inevitable that every vascular surgeon will, with some frequency, encounter patients who represent a prohibitive risk for conventional graft replacement, yet alternative forms of treatment (such as axillofemoral bypass in conjunction with induced AAA thrombosis) generally have been abandoned despite preliminary reports of their initial success.","1747":"Kidney transplantation is the most satisfactory modality of treatment for end-stage renal disease. Over the past decade, the results of kidney transplantation have improved dramatically, due to the availability of new immunosuppressive drugs. A newer, more potent drug, Tacrolimus (TAC), approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on April 12, 1994, is very promising also in renal transplantation, with one-year patient and graft survival equal or superior to results of recipients treated with cyclosporine (CyA). However, the number of patients on dialysis and awaiting kidney transplantation has increased more than fivefold during the past 15 years and now exceeds 26,000.","1748":"This chapter will serve to update last year's report, published in SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL III and will discuss our experience at the University of Pittsburgh with the use of tacrolimus as the primary immunosuppressive agent after renal transplantation, and our program of combined kidney-bone marrow transplantation to augment chimerism.","1749":"Thirty years ago when the first immunosuppressive agents became available for clinical grafting, the procedure was regarded with great skepticism by the medical profession as a pastime for ignorant surgeons with results that at best were poor. With the introduction of cyclosporin 15 years ago, the results of organ transplantation improved, and for the first time it was possible to transplant lung and pancreas with a reasonable outcome. Now more than 200,000 organ grafts have been performed worldwide and the procedure is an important established part of therapeutic surgery.","1750":"Augmentation cystoplasty is the treatment of choice for the hyperreflexic, poorly compliant bladder unresponsive to medical treatment. While the etiology for such bladders is multiple, the clinical manifestations are few and include urinary incontinence, urinary tract infections, and upper tract deterioration. When such bladders are accompanied by hydroureteronephrosis with or without reflux, the dilated ureter and pelvis may be used to augment the bladder. Ureterocystoplasty is rapidly gaining acceptance among pediatric urologic surgeons. Dilated ureter is clearly the best tissue available for augmentation. It is lined with transitional cell epithelium, and the muscular backing provides the necessary properties for a compliant reservoir. The lack of mucous production and absorptive or secretory properties of urothelium prevents some of the most common problems encountered with other forms of augmentation cystoplasty (e.g., metabolic abnormalities, mucous production, lithiasis, and recurrent infections). The use of urothelium also eliminates the long-term concern of malignant degeneration of bowel used in augmentation.","1751":"Malignant epithelial tumors of the urinary bladder are the fourth most common cancer among men, excluding squamous cell cancer of the skin, and are diagnosed in over 50,000 patients each year. Although the ratio is decreasing somewhat, bladder cancer is three times as common in males than in females and is responsible for over 10,000 deaths annually. White males may have an increased risk compared to Afro-American males though this appears to be true for superficial disease only. Well-documented risk factors for the disease include cigarette smoking, chemical carcinogens, schistosomiasis and chronic urinary tract infections, and a wide variety of occupations concentrated in the chemical, dye, rubber, and textile industries. Occupational exposure appears to be a contributory factor for the disease in nearly 25% of the male population in the United States with bladder carcinoma.","1752":"Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed neoplasm in men in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Traditionally, advanced prostate cancer was used in reference to patients with bony metastases. Changes in the management and detection of adenocarcinoma of the prostate have altered the very definition of what we consider advanced disease. Over 50% of patients newly diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate present with locally advanced or metastatic lesions. This corresponds to stages T3, N+, or M+. Sixty-eight percent of patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate will respond to androgen withdrawal. This may come in the form of either orchiectomy, estrogen administration, or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist administration. Unfortunately, one-half of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate will live less than two years. The mean survival of patients presenting with metastatic disease is 1.8 years. Once patients relapse from hormonal control of advanced prostatic carcinoma, few will respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Since the introduction of hormonal therapy by Huggins and Hodges in 1941, multiple forms of androgen manipulation have been proposed. The concept of advanced prostatic carcinoma needs to include not only those patients with Stage D-2 (M+), but also those with D0, D1 (N+), C (T-3), a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after radical prostatectomy, and initial high Gleason grade (9 to 10). These patients are all at significant risk of progression and potential death due to prostate cancer.","1753":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate uncommon before the age of 40 but occurring in most men as they age. The symptoms of BPH are generally attributed to bladder outlet obstruction from the enlarging prostate gland. However, not all men with enlarged prostates are symptomatic, and similar voiding symptoms can occur from other causes in the absence of BPH. Symptomatic BPH is a major health problem and a major expense to the healthcare system. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the treatment of choice for over 50 years, and until recently, approximately 400,000 TURPs have been performed annually in the United States at an estimated cost of $4 billion to $5 billion per year. TURP is an effective treatment for relief of prostatic obstruction and has generally been referred to as the gold standard.","1754":"An estimated 750,000 to 1,000,000 vasectomies are done per year in the United States. For a variety of reasons, many of these patients may eventually present for vasectomy reversal. Here at the Kaiser- Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, we have developed a modified one-layer, nonstented, microsurgical vasovasostomy which we have been using routinely for vasectomy reversals since 1984. The technique is easy to learn and can be employed with a high degree of success.","1755":"Approximately 15% of all couples suffer from infertility, and in 10% of cases, anovulation or oligoovulation is a factor. One of the most common clinical syndromes in which anovulation occurs, often presenting as infertility, is the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).","1756":"Bipolar coagulation has long been a safe and effective method of achieving surgical hemostasis. With the advent of laparoscopic procedures, the safety of bipolar coagulation has become even more vital. Unfortunately, the inability of this technology to divide tissue safely has limited its use. For the last 18 months, a new bipolar coagulating\/cutting forceps has been evaluated. Its overall benefit has been its ease of use and a reduction in operating time and cost.","1757":"Operative laparoscopy is an alternative to laparotomy for most gynecologic surgical procedures, but its role in gynecologic oncology has been considered only recently. Laparoscopy has been applied to gynecologic cancer with good results. Advantages include better visualization of the abdominal cavity and more rapid recovery, allowing earlier initiation of either chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Concerns include the risk for dissemination of neoplastic disease if less radical surgery is performed. With improvements in technology and advanced clinical experience, laparoscopic radical surgery can be performed with adequate tissue margins, conforming to accepted guidelines. Further, studies have shown that the yield of pelvic nodes significantly increases with experience. The danger of abdominal wall tumor implantation after laparoscopy for malignant conditions should be considered, but is infrequent. Careful techniques and the use of a laparoscopic pouch can prevent peritoneal dissemination and protect the abdominal wall. By cooperating closely, the surgical team and oncologists can offer the cancer patient optimal management with the lower morbidity and rapid recovery associated with laparoscopic surgery. However, follow-up studies are needed to determine the long-term survival following operative laparoscopy.","1758":"Laparoscopic myomectomy is gaining in popularity as a means of treating leiomyoma uteri, avoiding hysterectomy, and thereby preserving or restoring fertility, when compared with traditional laparotomic surgery. While technically demanding, a laparoscopic procedure has advantages beneficial to the patient; these include decreased postoperative pain and discomfort, decreased length of stay and cost, and more rapid return to full activity. The disadvantages of laparoscopic myomectomy include increased operative time, inability to palpate the uterus at myomectomy, and the requirement of advanced technical skills. We report on our experience with laparoscopic myomectomy for treatment of infertility, habitual abortion, or to treat symptomatic myomata while preserving fertility.","1759":null,"1760":"Acomplete gynecological examination of young children and senile patients requires special considerations and techniques. Due to the intact hymenal ring or the very narrow, atrophic vagina, the routinely used instruments, specula, will not allow sufficient visualization. To establish exact diagnosis and apply adequate therapy, proper examination of the vagina is required. For this purpose Huffman-Huber or Cameron-Muller equipment is traditionally used (Fig. 1). A modified Foley catheter was used by Redman, further improving the obtained picture, and the application of a balloon vaginoscope has been described by Terruhn. In spite of all these developments, examinations frequently turn out to be difficult due to insufficient vaginal wall distension and bleeding. Based on our previous experience, we describe a modified vaginoscopy, using hysteroscope and continuous liquid irrigation.","1761":"With the advent of hysteroscopy, the diagnosis of intrauterine pathology has greatly improved. Endometrial polyps and submucous fibroids are easily visualized; however, normal appearing cavities have been reported in over 50% of patients with menorrhagia. For this reason a myometrial biopsy was originally developed to see what percentage of these patients with a hysteroscopically normal-appearing cavity might have adenomyosis. The myometrial biopsy was taken from the posterior endometrial wall with a 5-mm loop electrode at the time of operative hysteroscopy. The specimen was sent to two pathologists, Dr. Anthony Mathios and Dr. John Abele, to see if adenomyosis could be diagnosed. It was found that with proper orientation, the amount of endometrial penetration into the myometrium could be measured. Therefore, superficial and deep adenomyosis can be diagnosed with a myometrial biopsy. But for a single myometrial biopsy to have any clinical relevance, two questions must be answered. First, does a single myometrial biopsy showing adenomyosis represent the entire endometrial cavity? Second, does the deepest adenomyosis occur in any certain area of the myometrial wall?","1762":"Hysteroscopy is a procedure with a century-long history, yet it may be said that few gynecologists actually have a hysteroscopy set-up in their office. At the same time, however, it would be surprising to find a urologist's office devoid of cystoscopy equipment.","1763":"Laparoscopic surgery in the United States was revolutionized in 1989. Even though Semm had popularized laparoscopic surgery in the early 1980s in Germany, it was the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1989 that triggered the explosive training and credentialing issues in laparoscopic surgery. In a letter to the editor of the American Journal of Surgery, in June 1990, the author had recommended the following for training courses: (1) the operators should have extensive hands-on experience in diagnostic laparoscopy prior to embarking on laparoscopic surgery; (2) hands-on training to develop hand-eye coordination using Berci-Sackier trainers; (3) extensive explanation on the use and abuse of videolaparoscope and accessory instrumentation; (4) a minimum experience as prime operator in at least 3 pigs, each weighing 90 to 100 lbs., with experience as an assistant operator and camera operator in 6 more pigs, making a total of 9 pigs per participant. This letter was written with the intent that proper training of surgeons would take place. We advocated a surgeon\/co-surgeon team approach to avoid adverse outcomes. In those days, weekend courses proliferated and surgeons came back and started doing procedures with minimal experience. This explosive growth was driven by patient demands for this procedure. As anticipated, untoward outcomes were reported.","1764":"The following is an introduction to a new intracorporeal knot-tying technique which brings the open, manual knotting method into the realm of laparoscopic surgery. This technique broadens the range of tissue approximation by suturing methods to include those that are performed at open surgery. Unique among all known knotting methods, it is performed with a multifunctional needle-holding instrument with a loop-forming spur member. The instrument includes important ergonomic features in its design and can be easily dismantled for inspection, cleaning, and sterilization by autoclave. In essence, the technique is a one-handed hand-tie action completed with two instruments where simple forward and rotation movement of the instrument mimics the role of the hooked index finger.","1765":"The endoscopic approach to surgery of paranasal sinuses has become the state-of-the-art treatment of chronic sinusitis. A significant disadvantage of the common endoscope is its monocular (two-dimensional) view, as the depth of the sinus system must then be estimated primarily on operating experience and continuous training. A stereoendoscope, on the other hand, has significant advantages. A stereoendoscope can produce a three-dimensional image and thereby emulate the physiological process of vision. The surgeon, therefore, need no longer rely on operating experience to determine the depth of various structures.","1766":"Complications in laparoscopic surgery are becoming more prevalent as more open procedures convert to laparoscopic procedures. This article will address incisional herniation of trocar wound sites and management of inferior epigastric bleeds. A trocar wound closure device allows for avoidance and rapid management of both the aforementioned complications. Clinical reports on the incidence of incisional hernias vary widely. However, the largest current clinical study (Kadar, Reich, Liu, et al.) regarding the incidence at .17% (3.1% in 12-mm extraumbilical sites and 0.23% at 10-mm extraumbilical sites). Some physicians feel that closure of the fascia is adequate for reducing the chance of incisional hernias. However, of the hernias reported in the Kadar study, one-half of the hernias occurred despite attempts to close the fascia. Another clinical paper reports two of the three hernias presented occurred in the preperitoneal space. In the past, if the fascia could easily be closed using conventional techniques, it was done; but if obesity made it difficult, only the skin was closed. This can no longer be considered good surgical technique.","1767":"During the past decade, several investigators reported effective application of intraoperative ultrasonography as a new diagnostic modality in surgery. Intraoperative ultrasonography has been successfully applied in the screening of the biliary tract and in the examination of the liver, pancreas, urinary tract, and endocrine organs. It has also been used successfully during vascular surgery. With the advent of minimal access surgery, the application of expensive preoperative diagnostic tests has visibly increased, particularly the use of ERCP procedures in patients with cholecystolithiasis. The loss of tactile feedback during laparoscopic surgery for gastrointestinal malignancy stimulated the increasing use of CT and MRI imaging. With our prior experience in intraoperative ultrasonography and in the advent of minimal access surgery, we were stimulated to introduce laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasonography (LIOU) in 1990 for screening the biliary tract for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. More reports on the use of laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasonography followed.","1768":"The existing occlusive clamps used in endoscopic surgery are modifications of the basic conventional scissors clamp design used in open surgery. All the current clamps, including atraumatic ones, cause tissue damage. The scissors design is intrinsically unsound because the occlusive force is not uniformly distributed and is much greater near the pivot end than between the free ends of the jaws. The ideal occlusive clamp should be based on parallel occluding jaws, as this mechanism ensures a uniform occlusion without undue crushing of the bowel. During the last two years we have been involved in the development of a detachable endoscopic atraumatic clamp. This has necessitated considerable biological experimentation, mechanical engineering design work, and clinical evaluation. The biological studies were concerned with the measurement of the forces (compression and friction) necessary to occlude and seal bowel at different intraluminal pressures without causing surface damage. The mechanical engineering and design development of the parallel jaw action clamp incorporating pseudoelastic nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) spring was based on the data obtained from the biological studies. Once the basic design was established, miniaturization allowed the production and clinical evaluation of an endoscopic detachable parallel action clamp (DPAC) that can be introduced through 5.0-mm ports.","1769":"Over the last few years, laparoscopic surgery has gained widespread acceptance in surgical practice. The indications range has expanded extraordinarily in that time. Some of the practiced procedures are already considered the gold standard, while others are still on the way there. The fascinating technique and results notwithstanding, a number of risks, mistakes, and complications are possible in both the initial and the advanced states. We present our experience from 2118 laparoscopic operations performed between February 1991 to March 1995, focusing on the intraoperative complications (Tables 1, 2).","1770":"In 1870 Reincke reported two cases in which tumors developed at the sites of paracentesis for ascites due to peritoneal carcinomatosis. History was repeated in a different context when two cases of port-site metastasis were reported in 1993. In the last 200 years tumor spread has remained a difficult phenomenon to understand, and minimal access surgery has added several more questions. Port-site metastasis has gained the attention of not only minimally invasive surgeons but also the media. Performing an operation for a benign condition is quite different from performing one for a malignant condition. Patients suffering from the latter may not value the advantages of minimal access surgery if there is an increased risk of tumor spread and less of a likelihood for cure.","1771":"The optimal management of inguinal hernia continues to excite lively debate and, despite centuries of research, the ideal approach has yet to be established. The traditional repairs of McVay, Bassini, and Shouldice involve suturing together tissues that are not normally in apposition. This approximation of tissues under tension may account for the reported recurrence rates of up to 21% for primary repairs and also explain the lengthy, painful recovery periods. Laparoscopic hernia repair has demonstrated good short-term results but is technically demanding, requires violation of the peritoneal cavity, and has unknown long-term results. Between October 1993 and April 1995, we performed 103 hernia repairs using a novel approach, the mini-hernia repair (endoscopically guided surface repair of inguinal hernia). This technique allows the benefits of an open surgical approach such as hands-on manipulation, three-dimensional vision, a familiar anatomical approach, and the use of conventional instruments, to be combined with the advantages derived from the use of laparoscopic instrumentation, namely, minimized tissue trauma and improved cosmesis.","1772":"Several indications for laparoscopic splenectomy are represented mainly by hematological disorders such as Idiopatic Thrombopenic Purpura (ITP) or hereditary spherocytosis. Patients with ITP who do not respond, have relapses of the disease under steroid treatment, or need a gradually increased dose of steroids, represent an excellent indication for laparoscopic splenectomy, as the spleen is not enlarged. Patients are usually small, thin, young females, making the procedure much easier. The size of the spleen in hereditary spherocytosis varies, sometimes making the procedure a little more difficult, especially as those patients have pigmented gallbladder stones necessitating a concurrent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Other indications are represented by staging of Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma of the spleen, and splenic infarcts without abscesses. Some patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia might benefit from laparoscopic splenectomy, but hypersplenism due to cirrhosis is strongly contraindicated, as the risk of intraoperative hemorrhage is great and not usually managed easily laparoscopically.","1773":"Laparoscopic surgical treatment of calculous disease of the gallbladder and biliary system has largely replaced the open surgical approach because of its well known and obvious advantages. This approach has also changed the traditional management of biliary duct stones. Formally, biliary calculous disease was managed by the surgeon in one setting usually by laparotomy with choledochotomy and common duct exploration. Referral for postoperative Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and Endoscopic Sphincterotomy (ES) was most commonly done for retained stones.","1774":"The surgical management of biliary stone disease has long since included ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) for the diagnosis and treatment of common bile duct (CBD) stones. Indications to ERCP\/ES have progressively expanded from the diagnosis and treatment of retained CBD stones after cholecystectomy to the management of severe cholangitis and acute pancreatitis in high-risk patients to the treatment of all patients with gallstones and CBD stones as part of an integrated endosurgical sequential approach.","1775":"With the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the general surgery community was thrust into the new world of minimally invasive surgery. The marked benefits of laparoscopic cholecystectomy became apparent in a short period of time, driving the procedure to widespread use long before any clinical trials or studies were available to document the procedure's safety. Although there was early concern over the potential dangers of the laparoscopic approach, it took several years before there was enough data to verify this concern. The most significant of these potential dangers is injury to the bile ducts.","1776":"Although surgery within the lumen of the gut has been performed for many years, this has traditionally involved a laparotomy and enterotomy. With the advances in flexible endoscopy, surgeons and gastroenterologists have been able to perform therapeutic procedures with instruments introduced through the working channel of flexible endoscopes. These procedures, however, have been mainly limited to technically minor ones, such as injection and cautery of bleeding ulcers and resection of polyps and small mucosal lesion. More recently, laparoscopic surgeons have been able to isolate the lumen of hollow organs as a separate working space and develop instrumentation and technique specifically for intraluminal surgery. This paper provides an overview of our approach, which includes development of a new device for intraluminal access and operations within the lumen of the stomach. Future application of this approach will also be discussed.","1777":"Laparoscopic treatment of intractable duodenal ulcers is intended for the treatment of patients who do not heal after a trial of intensive regimen of medication such as H2 blockers and\/or therapy aimed at eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Patients in a category who are Helicobacter-negative can be offered a laparoscopic treatment of their ulcer by vagotomy. Patients who have early relapses on stopping medical treatment are also candidates for vagotomy. Complications of the disease, such as bleeding or pyloric outlet obstruction, represent valid indications in 1995 for performing surgery in patients with duodenal ulcer disease.","1778":"Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is now in clinical use for the management of small, early-stage gastric, carcinomas, although some patients are treated via laparotomy when the lesions are not suitable for, EMR due to their size, depth, and location. In many cases of invasive mucosal carcinoma with submucosal involvement, the regional lymph nodes along with the distal portion of the stomach must also be resected. In order to remove the whole resected specimen, a mini-laparotomy of appropriate length (5 cm) is performed which can be located at the optical port site after removing the laparoscope. By applying an abdominal wall elevator through the mini-laparotomy, direct vision is possible which facilitates resection of the regional lymph nodes and intestinal anastomosis. We describe our technique for laparoscopically assisted distal gastrectomy and present our early clinical results.","1779":"Studies of the natural history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) indicate that most patients have limited disease responsive to simple lifestyle, dietary and medical therapy and do not go on to develop complications. Thus the majority of patients manifest a relatively benign form of the disease and do not need antireflux surgery. Indeed, expanding the indications for surgery to include patients with lesser forms of the disease will only serve to lessen the overall rate of successful surgery. However, approximately 25% of the patients with GERD will develop recurrent or progressive disease. It is this population of patients that is best suited to surgical therapy. Although at present there is no reliable method to identify which patients will develop progressive disease, there are several factors that predispose patients to complications and failure of medical therapy. These factors should be identified early in the course of therapy and taken into account when considering therapeutic alternatives.","1780":"Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is indicated in patients with documented gastroesophageal reflux disease who are refractory to maximal medical therapy or who develop a complication of reflux. The laparoscopic approach is a technically demanding procedure which requires extensive two handed tissue dissection and advanced suturing and knotting skills. Our experience with over 400 laparoscopic antireflux procedures over the last three years has highlighted several technical aspects which facilitate the procedure.","1781":"Since conventional insulin therapy has failed to achieve tight glucose control, an alternative treatment is urgently needed to treat diabetes. The findings of the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial1 conclusively establish that improved glycemic control delays the onset and slows the progression of neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. The disease leads inexorably to one or more of the secondary complications, including renal failure, blindness, coronary and peripheral vascular occlusive disease. The challenge physicians face is to intervene before these secondary complications take their toll. Transplantation of encapsulated human islets to reverse diabetes by a minimally invasive or minor surgical procedure, without the risk of high-dose or life-long immunosuppression will be described here. In the near future, the shortage of donor human tissue will be overcome either by the use of encapsulated xenograft (porcine) islets or proliferated human islets. Thus, encapsulated islet therapy may become possible for the millions of diabetic patients who may benefit from islet cell transplantation.","1782":"Cryosurgical ablation involves the in situ freezing and resultant devitalization of neoplastic lesions. It offers a number of potential advantages over surgical resection that make it particularly appealing for the treatment of hepatic neoplasms. Recent improvements in imaging modalities used to monitor cryosurgery, particularly ultrasonography, have made it a reasonable procedure in select patients. Colorectal carcinoma accounts for the second highest cancer-related mortality in the United States with nearly 70,000 annual deaths from this disease. Approximately 150,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. The liver represents the sole site of metastatic spread in approximately 20% of cases, reflective of the preferential spread of colorectal cancer to the liver via the portal venous system. Unfortunately, fewer than 25% of these patients (i.e., 4000 to 5000 patients) are candidates for surgical resection secondary to bilobar involvement, proximity to major vessels, poor liver reserve, or co-morbid disease states. Currently, systemic chemotherapy offers no significant impact on survival in patients with colorectal liver metastases with response rates in the range of 20% to 30%.","1783":"Technological advances in monitoring for anesthesia continue to provide clinicians with an increasing amount of physiologic information for critical intraoperative decision making. This expanded set of physiologic data not only makes routine surgery safer from rare, but potentially fatal, anesthetic or surgical mishaps; it also facilitates surgery on very high risk patients. However, it must be emphasized at the onset that anesthesia monitoring is probably more appropriately termed perioperative or critical care monitoring, since many of these advances are applicable in the critical care units as well.","1784":"Medicine is ever changing, as is the discipline of surgery. During the last decade, surgery has experienced a technological renaissance driven primarily by the desire to provide patients less invasive surgical treatments with shorter operating times, hospital stays, and recuperative periods. Many traditional open surgical procedures are now being replaced with endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques. As these minimally invasive techniques become sublimated in medical practice, the quest to develop truly noninvasive techniques continues in many medical specialties.","1785":"The rapidly expanding field of laparoscopic surgery has required surgeons to adapt to a new operating environment. New procedures and techniques test the surgeon's skill and confidence. Supporting laparoscopic advances has required redesign of equipment and training. The latter often is presented in a step-by-step format related to a particular surgical procedure (e.g., laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, etc.). The problems with this approach are the assumptions that the surgeon already possesses the necessary skills to perform fundamental surgical techniques in the new modality and that most participants enrolled in any given course will have a similar level of skill.","1786":"From earliest times, visual aids - from crude diagrams to complex, beautiful wax anatomical models - have been created to enhance the surgical learning process. Surgical educators realized early that suitable models could be used to develop the needed technical expertise essential to the safe performance of surgery. Practice on models also assisted in developing surgical judgment.","1787":"Man is the only animal capable of tying a square knot. During the course of an operation you may be asked by the surgeon to tie a knot. As drawing and coloring are the language of art, incising, suturing and knot tying are the grammar of surgery. A facility in knot tying is gained only by tying ten thousand of them. When the operation is completed, take home with you a package of leftover sutures. Light a fire in the fireplace and sit with your lover on a rug in front of the fire. Invite her to hold up her index finger, gently crooked in a gesture of beckoning. Using her finger as a strut, tie one of the threads about it in a square knot. Do this one hundred times. Now make a hundred grannies. Only then may you permit yourself to make love to her. This method of learning will not only enable you to master the art of knot tying, both grannies and square, it will bind you, however insecurely, to the one you love.","1788":"The explosive development of minimally invasive surgery has had a staggering impact on the hospital, operating room, and surgeon, as well as on the medical equipment industry and insurance carriers. As a result of (1) the overwhelming demand by the public, (2) the potential of future developments of this modality, and (3) the progressive geometric influence that has spread to the various surgical subspecialties, unprecedented pressure has been placed on our systems for training, credentialing, developing, supplying, and evaluating changes in surgical technique.","1789":"The clutter of equipment and lines in today's operating room (OR) is increasing. This problem may present unnecessary hazards to traffic and adversely affect the performance of the surgical team. Endoscopic surgery is particularly affected by this problem because it requires additional equipment. This study offers surgeons' views about OR crowding and provides a detailed summary of the distribution of furniture, equipment, cables, and tubes during open and laparoscopic operations. We prospectively studied an unselected series of general surgical open (OP, n=10) and laparoscopic (LAP, n=10) operations performed at a major university teaching hospital.","1790":"The concept of a machine-augmented surgeon will become a widespread reality only after the barrier of harnessing the computer as a tool has been successfully accomplished. The prospects of surgical robots for computer-assisted surgery, for telemedicine, and for teleoperation-cybersurgery-will be greatly enhanced when computers are no longer considered a separate component that links a system together, they must lose their identity, becoming transparent. The ideal human-machine interface for surgery is one juxtaposed between surgeon and patient that derives digital biosignals directly from both bodies, transmitting them transparently without perceptible delay, and distributes them bilaterally into afferent (sensory) and efferent (operator or effector) limbs. This ideal human-computer interface will be based upon biosignal processing and will optimize the technology to the physiology, in what has been called biocybernetics. Applications of biosignal interfaces are being developed in entertainment, medicine, commerce, defense, and in sales and distribution (Table 1).","1791":"For many years, the development and use of commercial information systems (IS) in medical environments have focused upon meeting the financial and administrative needs of medical care. Clinical information systems developed along a relatively separate path, primarily in academic and medical center environments. Today, trends resident throughout the United States are forcing the clinical, financial, and administrative sides of medicine to come together. These coalescing forces are driving the development of a new generation of information systems, with direct use and application for clinical practitioners.","1792":"Endoscopic surgery has led to changes in surgical practice which may rival the introduction of anesthesia and antibiotics in significance. As a result, an exciting synergy has rapidly emerged between technology and clinical practice. However, questions of training, credentialing, and patient safety have been raised as traditional procedures have been adapted to the minimally invasive approach and new ones are described. Many surgeons have been reluctant to venture beyond laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Halting first efforts at advanced procedures may prolong operative times, increase risk, and raise costs. Older methods of surgical education are not adequate to meet the current need (Fig. 1).","1793":"Laparoscopic surgery has been successfully employed for many years by gynecological surgeons. Following the widespread success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, minimally invasive surgery has expanded to be adapted to all general surgical procedures including hernia repair, oesophagectomy, appendicectomy, Meckel's diverticulectomy, and Nissen fundoplication. Laparoscopic colonic surgery has not developed at the same rate as other procedures because of the requirement for advanced laparoscopic surgical skills, deficiencies in instrumentation and concerns about the potential risks of laparoscopic surgery for neoplasia. However, laparoscopic procedures for treating rectal prolapse may constitute some of the best applications for colorectal laparoscopic techniques. A technique of laparoscopic rectopexy performed using the endoscopic stapler and intracorporal suturing of mesh is described.","1794":"A new laparoscopic operation for the treatment of mucosal or submucosal gastric lesions has been designed and performed on 12 patients. In this procedure, all three trocars are placed in the gastric cavity, penetrating both the abdominal and gastric walls in order to perform a laparoscopic removal of gastric lesions. The operation is then carried out in the gastric cavity using currently available laparoscopic instruments and laparoscopic monitoring. The procedure is easy, safe and feasible for mucosal or submucosal lesion of the stomach that cannot be treated by gastrofiberscopic technique. In this series, we treated a total of 12 patients: 10 patients with early gastric cancer, 1 with a submucosal leiomyoma and 1 with giant polyps of the stomach - all of which were treated uneventfully. Since this technique is based on a new concept in laparoscopic surgery, the author has named this operation \"Laparoscopic Intra-gastric Surgery\" (L.I.G.S.).","1795":"Peptic ulcer disease will eventually affect more than 3-4% of the Occidental population. The medical management of this disease, including H2 Blockers, proton pump inhibitors and antihelicobacter therapy, has been well defined and has been very successful. However, the treatment of chronic duodenal ulcer disease has been less successful, thus subjecting these patients to long term disability. It is with chronic duodenal ulcer disease as well as with its complications, such as bleeding, obstruction or perforation, where the surgeon can impact, using laparoscopic surgical techniques as an added therapeutic option.","1796":"A fundal wrap of the abdominal segment of the esophagus, transposed from the Rossetti modification of the classic Nissen fundopfication, is the operation of choice for surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux refractory to medical therapy. Previously validated by open anti-reflux surgery, fundoplication has also proven reliable, effective, and reproducible when performed by laparoscopy, a technique the authors have used routinely since 1989 thanks to the experience gained in vagotomy by a trans hiatal approach.","1797":"The attachment of soft tissue to bone is a problem in orthopedic surgery. Over the last one hundred years several methods have been used. The earliest method involved drilling a hole in the bone, pulling the tendon through the hole and sewing the tendon onto itself. While this worked on tendon transfers, it did not work particularly well around the knee, shoulder and the ankle where there are large areas of cancellous bone and the tissue to be reattached is ligamentous and is less well-defined than a tendon. The second method was to split the periosteum, prepare a trough in the bone, and sew the tendon or the soft tissue directly into the periosteum. This method requires long immobilization of the joint, and while it does work, the immobilization often leads to arthrofibrosis. Staples, nails, tacks, and other devices have been used to attach soft tissue with various degrees of success.","1798":"From its inception in 1911, the topic of spinal fusion has seemingly been shrouded in controversy. In that year, Dr. Russell Hibbs performed the first human spinal fusion on a patient with spinal tuberculosis. This spawned a debate over the procedure that led to the denial of Hibbs' membership to the American Orthopedic Association. The procedure (and Hibbs' appointment to the AOA) was validated by the Association after ten years of debate. The debate over spinal fusions is manifold to this date. The literature is replete with differing opinions regarding the indications, techniques and outcomes of spinal fusions. The topic is further compounded by the fact that the specifics of a spinal fusion are often distinct to the area of the spine fused.","1799":"Techniques for the repair and reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) have advanced rapidly in the last decade. The procedure for ACL reconstruction and its equipment have become progressively sophisticated from what was once an open surgery requiring dislocation of the patella to the point where ACL reconstruction surgery can now be performed endoscopically through one small incision. By avoiding a superior \/ lateral incision through the quadriceps muscle, the endoscopic technique provides the advantages of reduced soft tissue morbidity, reduced pain and improved cosmetic appearance for the patient, and reduced costs due to the fact that the procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis. However, the success of the procedure in restoring normal stability and function to the knee is still based on the variables of graft type, placement, tension, and fixation, as well as postoperative rehabilitation. Numerous studies have provided valuable information regarding advancements in the surgical technique and rehabilitation for ACL reconstruction surgery. Regardless, variable success rates continue to be reported. For failures occurring within the first six months after surgery, graft fixation failure has been shown to be the major cause.","1800":"Looking at the drawings in Hey Groves pioneering (1920) description of cruciate ligament reconstruction, it is obvious that what the author had in mind was insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) at the anatomical attachment sites, even though he did not make that point in so many words. Palmer was the first to stress the importance of precise drill-hole placement in 1938, and to design his own drill guide to obtain this precision. And only in the last 10 years have the biomechanical principles of accurate cruciate reconstruction been established. The term \"isometry\" was coined to express the need for a near-constant distance between the femoral and tibial attachments of the substitute ligament throughout the range of knee movement. In practice, however, ideal isometry is impossible to achieve, and length variations of up to 2mm are often acceptable. Both the anterior and the posterior cruciate ligament are made up of several bundles, with each bundle consisting of a large number of fibrils (Figure 1a, b). There is no point in the range of movement, including full extension, at which all the ACL fibers would be taut; throughout the range, some fibers will be tense, while others will be slack. The greater part of the stress is taken by the anteromedial bundle; these are the fibers that are tense in full extension. This is why Friederich. et al. recommend ACL reconstruction with drill holes within the proximal and distal attachments of the native anteromedial bundle. Hefzy, et al. tried to determine the factors that affect the region of most isometric femoral attachments of the ACL. They noted that there is no completely isometric attachment. Kentsch and Muller described for the first time a technique for replacing both the anteromedial and the posterolateral bundle using a split patellar tendon graft. One strip would be positioned over the top, the other through a transcondylar tunnel. However, this technique is very difficult and time-consuming.","1801":"Total joint replacement has become one of the more common orthopaedic operations, with approximately 240,000 major joint arthroplasties performed annually in the United States, a large percentage of these being of the hip. The vast majority of hip replacements are for the diagnosis of degenerative arthritis and are performed in patients greater than 60 years of age. Less commonly the procedure is performed for other diagnoses (eg, developmental disorders of the hip, inflammatory arthritis, and post-traumatic arthritis) and in younger patients. Each of these diagnoses are associated with unique characteristics posing an array of technical challenges for the surgeon. The purpose of this manuscript is to highlight the more common of these processes with emphasis on the technical difficulties encountered when reconstructing these hips.","1802":"The current success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) as a solution for arthritic problems about the knee is reflected in the increasing number of these procedures. The 1992 annual hospital discharge summaries indicate approximately 160,000 TKAs were performed in the United States for both primary and revision indications. Clinical success of TKA is rooted in a refined appreciation of patient habitus, technical proficiency and implant design. The understanding of this integrated triad has evolved over the past two decades. The evolution of knee implant design reflects recognition of the principle that implant geometry, acting in concert with surrounding soft tissues, determines the joint stability, range of motion and implant\/bone interface forces. Interchangeable plateau geometries associated with modular designs, represent a recent development which permit an optimization of these interactions for a specific patient pathology. This paper describes a comparative evaluation of the geometrical constraint offered by six primary modular knee systems and describes their clinical applicability.","1803":"Brachial plexus surgery has been performed since the first half of our century, but initially the procedure was a rudimentary technique. Results were very poor, in fact, because of insufficient knowledge of the anatomy of the brachial plexus, of the pathophysiology of nerve regeneration and because of inadequate means of diagnosis and lack of modern sophisticated surgical equipment. Because of the poor results, a group of outstanding orthopedic surgeons wrote, in the sixties, an official agreement stating that brachial plexus surgery was useless and should be abandoned. Nevertheless, even though obstetrical palsies were on the decline due to the increase in Cesarean sections, the need for brachial plexus surgery was on the rise with the dramatic increase in the number of car and motorcycle accidents.","1804":"Conservative surgery of selected breast-cancer tumors up to 4 cm in size gives rise to equivalent overall survival rates in both retrospective and randomized chmcal trials. Although 90 percent of patients display satisfactory functional and cosmetic results when surgery is performed by highly competent teams, the remaining 10 percent end up with severe breast deformities due to factors such as inappropriate selection of patients, poor surgical techniques, postradiation fibrosis and scar contractures. These patients also suffer from painful, hard, edematous breasts. Severe breast deformities are always associated with malpositioning and distortion of the nipple-areola complex. Significant contour abnormalities, characterized by retraction and depression, may hinder reconstruction by the plastic surgeon if the patient wishes to retain the residual breast.","1805":"Efforts to explore the cavities of the human body date back to Hippocrates, who pioneered \"endoscopic\" procedures by performing rectoscopy. The following 2400 years brought tremendous technical advances and an understanding of normal and abnormal human anatomy and physiology. In this century, organ transplantation, microsurgery, and most recently fetal surgery have stepped out of the realm of science fiction and into reality.","1806":"Ever since surgery was introduced for the treatment of neurological diseases, miniaturized approaches have been considered and developed in order to limit trauma of vital and delicate structures of the central nervous system. Thus, the application of stereotactic techniques and endoscopy date back to the beginning of this century. Stereotactic neurosurgery started with the goal of reaching target areas in the brain through a burrhole and then to guide (by the aid of landmarks on the bony skull and its radiographic image) small instruments such as needles and biopsy forceps. Moreover, ventriculograms with contrast material were used as guides to calculate coordinates for a 3-dimensional guiding-system within the brain. Coordinates for the brain's interior structures had to be taken from a theoretical average human brain as shown in a stereotactic brain atlas.","1807":"The aim of human brain grafting is to deliver adequate amounts of endocrine or neural tissue to neurodegenerated areas of the diseased or lesioned brain for functional recovery. The many options available make brain grafting and other neural grafting procedures potentially applicable for the treatment of varied alterations of the central nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord lesions, assorted traumatic lesions to the central nervous system, stroke, etc.","1808":"Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell, frustrated by the invasiveness of existing surgical tools and the morbidity some neurosurgical patients endured, created the field of stereotactic radiosurgery in 1951. He subsequently pioneered the development of the dedicated multi-source Cobalt 60 Gamma Knife. During the 27 year interval from its first clinical use in 1967 to its latest application in 1994, single fraction, closed skull irradiation of deep intracranial targets has been performed in more than 20,000 patients worldwide. The goals of radiosurgery are obliteration or prevention of further growth of the target coupled with reduced patient risk in comparison to more invasive procedures.","1809":"Although blood transfusion has helped make major vascular surgery possible, it has done so at a potential cost to our patients. Allogeneic red cell transfusions subject patients to the risks of transfusion reactions, disease transmission, and immunomodulation. These risks can be avoided in the majority of our patients through a better understanding of transfusion practices and the use of multiple alternatives to allogeneic blood.","1810":"Thromboembolism from a venous source continues to be of clinical significance with an annual incidence of 300,000 to 600,000 cases. These episodes of pulmonary embolism result in at least 50,000 deaths per year despite the use of effective prophylaxis and availability of noninvasive techniques to establish early diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic events. The main treatment modality continues to be effective anticoagulation, but this treatment may fail to control thromboembolism in 5% to 10% of patients, and anticoagulants have been associated with a mortality rate of up to 15%.","1811":"Chronic venous insufficiency has been known as a distinct pathologic entity at least since the time of Hippocrates, yet many pathologic features of this common ailment remain obscure. A recent resurgence of investigative effort in chronic venous insufficiency has occurred, spurred by the development of valve reconstruction surgery. The advent of newer diagnostic devices and techniques such as duplex scan and air plethysmography allow for a more detailed examination of the venous system than was possible previously.","1812":"Each new technique for achieving and clarifying the diagnosis of arterial disease has stimulated an effort to establish its value as a tool for guiding surgical intervention. Noninvasive studies such as oculoplethysmography (OPG), phonoangiography, Doppler ultrasound spectral analysis, B-scan ultrasound, duplex ultrasound, computed tomographic (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transcranial Doppler have been seductive because these tools require no invasion of the. body or the artery of interest and are, therefore, eminently safe.","1813":"As has been the case in many fields in medicine, noninvasive vascular testing techniques originated in research projects to provide more exact definition of normal and abnormal physiology. Early tests were cumbersome to perform, due in part to the lack of dedicated equipment. The introduction of Doppler ultrasound technology in the late 1960s expanded the horizon for vascular testing. By the early 1970s, vascular testing had moved out of the research laboratory into the clinical arena. Dedicated noninvasive laboratories were established within hospital settings as well as part of office practices. The addition of duplex scanning greatly enhanced the capability of noninvasive laboratories and contributed further to growth of noninvasive testing. By the end of the decade, the vascular laboratories were well established across the country. The 1980s saw a great increase in the number of vascular laboratories, as well as the number of tests performed. There appeared to be unrestricted potential for growth and, unfortunately, increasing examples of abuse were encountered. As could be expected, excesses did not remain unchallenged and increasing restrictions were placed on the vascular laboratories, primarily in the areas of payment policy and levels of reimbursement.","1814":"Angiography currently is the principle diagnostic test for evaluation of the vasculature. Though this invasive radiologic procedure demonstrates vascular anatomy and areas of narrowing and blockage, it does not define the specific cause of the occlusion. This limitation may inhibit the appropriate treatment of vascular disease. Recently, a variety of endovascular tools designed for the treatment of specific disorders have been developed, such as lytic therapy for thrombotic occlusions, lasers for fibrotic occlusions, and atherectomy catheters for calcific atherosclerotic occlusions. For effective use of these tools, the specific cause of a vascular lesion must be determined. Angioscopy can enhance the use of these innovative therapies by providing a real-time panoramic view of the lumen, which permits both the diagnosis of luminal irregularities and visual guidance of specific luminal therapy.","1815":"The diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been established with increasing frequency during the past two decades. Although AAA may cause distal embolization, rupture remains the most common and deadly complication. For nearly 40 years, elective replacement with a synthetic graft has proved to be the most appropriate method to prevent AAA rupture, and it has been associated with a postoperative mortality rate of less than 5% at most medical centers. Nonfatal complications occur with some regularity, irrespective of the setting in which the operation is performed. Increasingly, vascular surgeons are encountering older patients with severe comorbid medical conditions that can increase operative morbidity and may significantly elevate mortality. This, in turn, can increase operative morbidity and may significantly elevate mortality for aortic surgery. An alternative form of treatment such as induction of aneurysm thrombosis generally has been abandoned despite preliminary reports ofinitial success.","1816":"Vascular surgery has evolved considerably over the past 100 years from a specialty that offered patients only palliative procedures to treat significant vascular diseases to a field centered on the diagnosis and correction of vascular disorders. Aortic and peripheral artery aneurysms were once medical problems rarely diagnosed and frequently fatal. Diffuse, occlusive arterial disease secondary to atherosclerosis frequently resulted in limb gangrene or specific end-organ ischemia. Modern vascular therapy has dramatically reduced the incidence of primary limb amputations and significantly decreased the risk of fatal complication of arterial aneurysm rupture.","1817":"Cardiac valve replacement surgery has advanced considerably over the past 20 years with suitable choices of mechanical prostheses and bioprostheses as valvular substitutes. The extensive developments over the past three decades have been introduced to reduce or eliminate valve related complications, namely thromboembolism, anticoagulant related hemorrhage, and structural failure as well as to optimize hemodynamic performance. The mechanical prostheses have been developed to eliminate structural failure, to facilitate prevention of blood status and thrombus formation, to facilitate intraoperative leaflet positioning and to facilitate radiopacity for evaluation of prosthesis function. The biological valvular prostheses, namely porcine aortic or bovine pericardium, have been developed with tissue preservation, together with stent designs, that contribute to preservation of anatomical characteristics and biomechanical properties of the leaflets. The implantation of the various present generation bioprostheses and mechanical prostheses requires special considerations to support ventricular performance and avoid technical complications.","1818":"The era of human heart transplantation began in 1967 by Dr. Christian Barnard in South Africa. Unfortunately, most patients died within the first year after transplantation from rejection or opportunistic infection, and the procedure was abandoned in all but a few centers. With the dedicated work of Dr. Norman Shumway from Stanford University, advances in immunosuppression and improved detection and management of rejection allowed heart transplantation to evolve from a laboratory curiosity into a clinical reality. Finally, with the introduction of the immunosuppressant, Cyclosporin A (CyA), in the 1980s the number of cardiac transplants being performed increased exponentially. Heart transplantation has entered the mainstream of surgical management of congestive heart failure and approximately 2000 procedures are performed annually in the United States and 3000 worldwide.","1819":"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a major cause of illness and death in the United States and abroad. Along with progress in the surgical management of this condition, numerous advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of AAAs. Since the time of Scarpa (1804), AAA disease has been associated with, and attributed to, atherosclerotic vessel changes. Excluding patients with Marfan's Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos type IV diseases, virtually all human AAA specimens contain some degree of atherosclerosis. However, atherosclerotic changes are associated with diverse arteriopathies (ie, aorto-occlusive disease versus AAAs). Over the last 25 years, considerable research has been performed comparing aneurysmal, occlusive, and normal aortae. AAA disease is a unique process with pathogenic mechanisms that may operate independently of atherosclerosis. In this chapter we discuss the incidence of AAA as well as its pathogenesis concerning genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, and immunology.","1820":"During the past 30 years orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) has become a highly successful form of therapy, and as of this writing it is being performed at more than 100 institutions in the U.S., and a similar number in Europe. This is testimony to the great advances achieved in this field since the 1960s and 1970s, when there were essentially only two places actively engaged in liver transplantation. Essential to its success have been the technical refinements introduced during the last three decades, which have allowed many surgeons around the world to be able to do the procedure safely. Liver transplantation is still considered as one of the most complex operations, and therefore the margin of error is small and attention to technical detail is crucial to a satisfactory outcome. This is magnified in importance since OLTx, unlike kidney, heart, pancreas and intestinal transplantation, lacks a back-up system, such as dialysis, ventricular assist device, insulin or total parenteral nutrition. Thus, the smallest mistake in the surgical management of the patient may prove fatal.","1821":"The history of clinical organ transplantation and its development in routine surgical practice has been packed into the last 40 years and is encompassed by the careers of many of the pioneers of transplantation. Improved immunosuppression, surgical, anesthetic, and postoperative management have transformed results and allowed many new organs to be transplanted. Progress in preserving organs for transplantation has lagged behind the other advances in transplantation. Until the introduction of UW solution, no major progress was made after the introduction of machine perfusion preservation by Dr. Belzer in 1967 and that of simple cold storage by Dr Collins in 1969. This solution was developed at the University of Wisconsin and has allowed extended simple cold storage of the pancreas, liver, kidney, and more recently, the small bowel prior to transplantation. The UW solution represents a good answer to the problem of short-term storage of organs for transportation and early reimplantation, but equally important, it has also stimulated renewed research interest in this area. A more profound understanding of the events occurring during hypothermic storage and subsequent reperfusion is needed if further advances are to be made. It is anticipated that if long-term organ storage is to be achieved this will require a perfusion preservation system that allows the maintenance of essential metabolic processes.","1822":"In the past 40 years, clinical renal transplantation has evolved from a risky, highly speculative endeavor to a fairly mature, well-established service. There are hundreds of programs around the world, transplanting thousands of patients annually, and reasonably good suecess rates have been achieved. Current expectations are of one year patient survival of 90 - 98%, and one year graft survival of 75 - 90%. In addition, patients who have been successfully transplanted have a markedly improved quality oflife compared with patients on dialysis. However, in spite of these encouraging results, there remain significant problems. Among them are acute rejection, which still occurs in 40 - 75% of cases, and graft loss secondary to rejection, acute or chronic, which limits the half-life of cadaveric kidneys to 8 years. As part of an effort to address these issues, there have been a number of new immunosuppressive agents and therapeutic modalities that have been investigated over the past several years. This chapter will focus on 2 areas of ongoing research in our institution, the use of FK506 in renal transplant patients, and the program of combined kidney\/bone marrow transplantation.","1823":"Presacral neurectomy (PSN) has been successfully used to treat women experiencing midline premenstrual and menstrual dysmenorrhea along with mid line pelvic pain for almost 100 years. Recent developments in minimally-invasive surgical technique have allowed the gynecologic surgeon to perform laparoscopic presacral neurectomy (LPSN) as an isolated procedure or in conjunction with other conservative procedures for the treatment of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea.","1824":"As with other organs, the etiology of bowel endometriosis is unknown. Its occurrence was reported as early as 1922 by Sampson. Following his investigation of nineteen cases, he proposed that \"implantation adenoma of endometrial type of some portion of the intestinal tract may be present in at least one half of the cases of perforated ovarian hematoma of endometrial type with peritoneal implantations.\"","1825":"Tubotubal anastomosis technique dates back to the 1920's when large sutures were used to approximate proximal and distal ends of the fallopian tube. Direct vision, aided by overhead illumination, was used and stitches were placed superficially to avoid inclusion of the posterior wall. Delicate tissue handling was not stressed. No major breakthroughs in this area developed over the next half century. The 21% success rate for the conventional technique was disappointingly low although a clear explanation has never been established. Presumably it was caused either by the failure to reconstruct a patent lumenal channel or by causing extensive postoperative adhesion formation.","1826":"What role could laparoscopy possibly play in treatment of uterine disorders and pelvic floor relaxation? The basic principle that laparoscopy is a mode of access, not a mode of treatment, must be emphasized. Statements such as \"laparoscopic treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence\" are misleading because they imply that laparoscopy is a treatment modality, which it isn't. Laparoscopy provides only access to the anatomical area. Theoretically any procedure classically done at laparotomy, can be done under laparoscopic control. Is executing such procedures self gratification for the surgeon or a benefit for the patient? No doubt, procedures performed under laparoscopic control require more surgical skill. The benefits for the patient are reduced need for analgesia, which means that the procedure is significantly less painful, less postoperative ileus, reduced length of hospital stay, and finally, reduced cost to society through both direct and indirect savings. The fact that the procedure is less painful is reason enough to eliminate laparotomy in favor of laparoscopy: \"Dolor per primam\" is part of Hippocrates' oath.","1827":"Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a pathological description of an aging process that affects a great majority of men. Classically, obstructive and irritative symptoms such as frequency, nocturia and weak urinary stream are described as \"prostatism\". Microscopically, BPH can be described as hyperplasia of stromal and epithilial cellular element which can macroscopically present as a gross adenomatous enlargement of the prostate gland. Thus, treatment of BPH is aimed at alleviating symptoms of prostatism and associated morbidities of prostatic obstruction.","1828":"With the increasing longevity of the population, the incidence of symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is expected to increase. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is currently considered the standard surgical treatment for this disease. However, TURP is an invasive procedure associated with some morbidity and, rarely, mortality. During the past several years, several alternative treatments for BPH have emerged. Visual laser ablation of the prostate (VLAP) is one of the more attractive choices among these alternatives. The use of laser energy to treat BPH has several advantages over TURP. Laser energy causes coagulation of the blood vessels, thus minimizing blood loss and fluid absorption. VLAP is an outpatient procedure performed under direct vision utilizing a standard or continuous-flow cystoscope. The technique of VLAP is relatively easily learned and has a much shorter learning curve than that of TURP. To date, clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of VLAP and the minimal associated morbidity. In the short-term follow-up, improvement in both subjective (symptom score) and objective (urinary flow rate) factors is similar to that after TURP. Although the results obtained with this laser technology are exciting and encouraging, further study and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm the durability of these results.","1829":"Latrogenic injury to the lower urinary tract, specifically the ureter and bladder, is a potential risk of any pelvic surgery. According to the available literature, the incidence of injury to the ureter ranges from 0.5-2.5% for routine pelvic operarions. In actuality, the incidence of ureteral injury during pelvic surgery may even be higher, as many cases are not reported, not detected or are asymptomatic. Injury to the bladder during pelvic surgery most commonly occurs in the form of inadverant laceration or placement of sutures through the bladder wall. Previous pelvic surgery, including Cesearean section, hysterectomy and bladder suspension procedures, and gynecologic conditions such as malignancy, endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease increase the risk for bladder trauma.","1830":"The rapid development of endoscopic methods in many fields of surgery has been possible by the fiberoptic technique in connection with high-quality video representation and computer-tomograhic imaging. In rhinology, there has been a worldwide adoption of the technique in diagnostics and treatment. In the beginning, the technique was founded on concepts developed after many years of endoscopic investigation and clinical observations by W. Messerklinger and coworkers in Graz, Austria, with later contributions from other European ENT clinicians, and it was subsequently made popular by Kennedy and colleagues in the United States. Nasal and paranasal sinus endoscopy proved to be a valuable diagnostic contribution to rhinology. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) has also proved suitable for treatment, not only of rhinologic disorders but also for some ophthalmologic and neurosurgical conditions. When properly used, ESS causes much less morbidity than does treatment with older \"conventional\" surgical methods. In the following discussion, I will briefly cover the pathophysiology of some of the disorders, the surgical indications and technique, as well as the results and complications of this kind of surgery.","1831":"Newly developed endoscopic instruments and devices, along with advanced endoscopic surgical techniques, have made it possible to perform an increasing variety of endoscopic procedures. These procedures consist of the same steps employed in the open procedure that preceded them but avoid their large incisions. This in turn eliminates many of the disadvantages associated with laparotomy and thoracotomy incisions. Postoperative pain is greatly decreased, postoperative hospital stay is shortened, and return to normal activities is expedited. Postoperative complications as well as early and late morbidity related to the surgical wound (e.g. wound infection, incisional hernia, wound dehiscence) are minimized. The incidence of intraabdominal adhesions and both early and late postoperative intestinal obstruction are decreased. Cosmesis is dramatically enhanced.","1832":"A 5-year-old girl with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was successfully treated by thoracoscopic surgery, which was the first successful case in Japan. The operation was carried out under general anesthesia with the usual endotracheal intubation. Short trocars were inserted through the left intercostal spaces to introduce a flexible video thoracoscope and adequate surgical instruments. After the ductus was carefully dissected and exposed, two titanium clips, 11 mm in length, were applied to interrupt the ductus completely. The continuous heart murmur of PDA disappeared, as confirmed by an esophageal stethoscope. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 6 postoperative day. Eighteen months after surgery, no residual PDA shunt was revealed by doppler echocardiogram. The advantages of thoracoscopic surgery for PDA are less postoperative pain and discomfort, early recovery and short hospital stay, and cosmetic preservation. Availability of smaller sized surgical instruments should allow smaller children or newborns with PDA to be treated with this method.","1833":"The application of laparoscopic surgical techniques to colonic surgery is restricted to selected cases and to rather few surgical centers. On the one hand, the disadvantages of the open approach involves the sizable laparotomy incision for mobilization of the viscera, especially if the colonic flexures are to be mobilized. On the other hand, in the minimally invasive approach the extent of dissection requires additional skills and a well honed endoscopic surgical team is needed especially if laparoscopic reconstruction of the large colon is to be accomplished. The teamwork is more critical for colon procedures than for laparoscopic gallbladder surgery.","1834":"The evolution of a preferred technique for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been occurring over the past several years. The early work of Ger involved a stapled closure of the dilated internal ring using a specialized 12-mm. instrument, which combined the functions of tissue approximation and stapling. This was followed by a prosthetic mesh plug technique of Schultz and Corbitt, which consisted of a free mesh plug occlusion of the inguinal canal, combined with prosthetic patch coverage of the hernia defect.","1835":"The first successful totally intra-abdominal laparoscopic Billroth II gastrectomy was performed on February 10, 1992, by our group in Singapore. The patient was a 76-year-old Chinese man with a 2-year history of gastric ulcer, which presented with bleeding. The operation took 4 hours and consumed 17 ENDO GIA (Auto Suture, USSC, Norwalk, CT) staplers. The benefits of this minimally invasive approach were clearly evident. The patient was walking on the first postoperative day, taking liquids on the third, solids on the fourth, and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. The operation was subsequently emulated by surgeons in about a dozen countries. The description in this chapter is a modification of the original technique, using the improved instrumentation that is now available.","1836":"Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), with or without hiatal hernia, is the consequence of a functional disturbance of the lower sphincter of the esophagus. This dysfunction is more and more often seen in populations with Western eating habits. According to recent reports, 10 percent of the patients suffer from constant heartburn, 30 percent from discontinuous heartburn demanding active treatment. Finally, a great number of non-digestive symptoms, either pulmonary, E.N.T., or cardiac, are also connected with GERD. In the early 1970s, medical treatment was not very effective, hence the popularity of open surgery. Although the results were satisfactory, postoperative sequelae, in particular parietal ones, could not be avoided. The reason is that a large laparotomy is necessary to gain access to the esophageal hiatus, which always involves potential risks of postoperative incisional hernia.","1837":"In the years since 1987, when Mouret introduced laparoscopic cholecystectomy in France, this approach has become the preferred method for management of symptomatic gallbladder disease. However, the treatment of calculous disease other than the gallbladder is not generally practiced by the laparoscopic approach. The treatment of common duct stones is largely managed by preoperative Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio Pancreatography (ERCP) or choledochotomy and exploration through a laparotomy incision. The authors believe that this lack of acceptance of laparoscopic treatment of common duct stones is because of the ready availability of ERCP and sphincterotomy in most centers countenanced by the difficulty of laparoscopic treatment.","1838":"At the beginning of laparoscopic surgery, common bile duct (CBD) stones were thought to be a contraindication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in the treatment of gallstones. At present, well-trained surgeons remove these stones in relation to LC. CBD stones are often present during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and when these stones are removed choledochoscopically a T-tube has to be inserted. This approach to remove the CBD stones has been documented. Insertion of a T-tube into the CBD is a subject open to discussion, because of one disadvantage when the T-tube is inserted into the CBD, patients stay in the hospital for more than 2 to 3 weeks postoperatively.","1839":"The liver, with its multiple metabolic, detoxifying, and filtering functions plays a key role in the field of oncology, as it is the site of both metastatic and primary cancers. This phenomenon occurs because of two factors, namely the proximity of the liver to other intra-abdominal organs as well as the extensive portal vein and lymphatic drainage systems. The lobular structure of the liver represents a barrier to cancer cells which ultimately flourish by producing either synchronous or metachronous hepatic lesions. The size of these metastasizes varies greatly and obeys the laws of expediential tumor growth, thus implying that some lesions will be too small to be detected by conventional methods.","1840":"Laparotomy is vision of the abdominal content by direct eyesight through an abdominal incision. Laparoscopy achieves the same or better result with an optic device placed into the abdomen through special introducers. Exploration, part or complete procedures, can be performed with much less postoperative morbidity; thishas instilled a new sense of optimism in both the community and surgical ranks. Suddenly it appeared that the old \"sacred\" rules of traditional surgery had been buried under a thick layer of dust.","1841":"The ideal energy form for use in laparoscopic surgery should provide controlled, hemostatic cutting. A good dissection technique should be further characterized by minimal thermal injury to surrounding tissue, no smoke obscuring the visual field, cutting ability equal to or superior to a conventional scalpel, coagulative ability equal to or greater than electrosurgery, lack of danger to the patient such as from stray energy, no toxins from exposure to smoke in the pneumoperitoneum elevating patient levels of methemoglobin or carboxyhemoglobin, no need for special preparation of the patient (grounding pad) or surgeon (glasses), and no need for special training. For a technology to replace that which is the current standard, this should all be provided at a cost similar to the cost associated with electrosurgery.","1842":"Since the new advances in video technology in the mid 1980's and the couplmg of the video camera to the laparoscope the surgeon no longer needs to control the laparoscope with his own hands. The advantage of this new development in laparoscopic surgery is that (1) it is not as tiring to perform (i.e., he no longer had to bend over the patient to look through the laparoscope's ocular), (2) the whole operating team could follow the progress of the surgery (for better or worse), and (3) that the surgeon is then enabled to operate with two hands, a new skill which must be learned since it is one of the keys to being more effective and efficient under the laparoscope. One of these advanced skills, intracorporeal suturing, is an especially demanding skill and requires a well-centered, and steady camera support for the technique to be performed efficiently. The disadvantage is that he must give oral commands to the individual who is now charged with guiding the laparoscope within the operative field and this disadvantage alone is sometimes thought the tip the balance in the wrong direction.","1843":"Video imaging technology has significantly enhanced the performance of minimally invasive surgical procedures. However, a major limiting factor for the endoscopic surgeon is to work in a 3-dimensional field while viewing a two-dimensional video image. Advances in electronic video imaging have resulted in satisfactory image quality yet the lack of depth perception with standard 2-dimensional video system results in the surgeon having to rely on indirect evidence to assess the third dimension. To gauge depth, one may have to rely on touching the tissues with endoscopic instruments or estimate the relative movement of the instruments in relation to the intra-abdominal organs. These maneuvers result in a reduction in the speed of surgery and may cause unnecessary tissue trauma. Recently a number of manufacturers have developed three-dimensional (3-D) video systems which significantly improve visualization and enhance the ability of the surgeon to perform delicate endoscopic dissection and suturing. These 3-D video systems may also improve the education of surgeons-in-training as they would have a better understanding of 3-dimensional anatomy during laparoscopic surgery.","1844":"If surgical art can be defined as the operative relationship between the surgeon and the living tissue then it is easy to conclude that this relationship has changed. On the one hand, changed for the better as far as the end result is concerned, but on the other hand, for the worse, as far as it relates to the surgeon's effort, that is, the method by which this improved result is obtained. In essence, the surgeon will have to work a great deal harder to provide the added benefit for the patient.","1845":"Laparoscopic surgery in the United States was revolutionized in 1989. Even though Semm had popularized laparoscopic surgery in the early nineteen eighties in Germany, it was the advent of Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in 1989 that triggered the explosive training and eredentialing issues in laparoscopic surgery. In a letter to the editor of the American Journal of Surgery, in June 1990, the author had recommended the following for training courses: 1) the operators should have extensive hands-on experience in diagnostic laparoscopy prior to embarking on laparoscopic surgery; 2) hands-on training to develop hand-eye coordination using Berci-Sackier trainers; 3) extensive explanation on the use and abuse of video laparoscope and accessory instrumentation; 4) a minimum experience as prime operator in at least 3 pigs, each weighing 90-100 lbs., with experience as an assistant operator and camera operator in 6 more pigs, making a total of 9 pigs per participant. This letter was written with an intent that proper training of surgeons would take place. We advocated a surgeon\/co-surgeon team approach, to avoid adverse outcomes. In those days, weekend courses proliferated and surgeons came back and started doing procedures with minimal experience. This explosive growth was driven by patient demands for this procedure. As anticipated, untoward outcomes were reported.","1846":null,"1847":"The genetic engineering of mammalian whole embryos has become one of the most popular and fruitful techniques in modern developmental biology, not only to investigate the normal development and pathogenesis of diseases but also to develop future gene-therapy applications for human genetic diseases. Although the rapid advancement of molecular biological techniques has created a theoretical basis for genetically engineering mammalian embryos, it has become practical only after the establishment of the culture system for mammalian embryos, which normally develop (hidden from the human eye) in the oviduct and the uterus, the improvement of optic instruments, and finally, the development and establishment of microsurgical techniques.","1848":"The system for directly manipulating mammalian embryos is an advantage not only to revealing the various developmental evidences but also in evaluating the availability of possible techniques for fetal surgery. \"Exo utero development in mice\" was reported by Muneoka et. al. and has been one of the most useful techniques in experimental embryology \\ including developmental neurobiology and prenatal plastic surgery for malformations. We have applied this method to establish experimental animal models with congenital disorders and examined the mechanisms of normal and abnormal morphogenesis. In this paper, we would like to introduce the technique of exo utero development in combination with a microinjection system in mice embryos.","1849":"Once a technique used primarily for gynecologic surgery, laparoscopy is becoming increasingly popular for the performance of abdominal procedures such as cholecystectomy, bowel resection, splenectomy, adrenalectomy, nephrectomy and inguinal hernia repair. Laparoscopy results in a shorter postoperative hospital stay, less time between surgery and the resumption of full activity, reduced hospital costs, and an earlier return to the work force. By avoiding a large abdominal incision, laparoscopic surgery results in improved cosmetic results and a reduced incidence of postoperative intraabdominal adhesions. Compared to open procedures, postoperative pain is generally considered less after laparoscopic surgery. Finally, respiratory function is less compromising following Iaparoscopic compared to open surgical procedures.","1850":"All too often, it seems that the utilization of antibiotics by surgeons for either prophylaxis or the treatment of established infections is shrouded in a combination of mysticism and marketing. What should be straight forward, frequently becomes confused by factors such as superstition, habit, recent interaction with an industry representative, and faulty information. The rational use of antibiotics is surprising simply, and is based on the fact that these agents are, quite simply, systemic chemotherapy against bacteria. Once delivered to the patient these agents act not only locally, but, more importantly, sistemically against susceptible microorganisms. This demands that the practitioner make an educated guess as to which bacteria are likely to be present, as well as use an agent that both safe and effective in that specific patient. The types and variety of bacteria present in a surgical infection, or likely to be present, can usually be deduced by the location and \/ or organ system involved. The safest and most effective agent to be used against those organisms is primarily a function of the specific hospital that the patient in, and whether the infection is hospital-acquired (nosocomial) or community-acquired. The susceptibility patterns for bacteria vary from community to community (as noted by local hospitals), as well as from hospital to hospital dependent on whether it is a community hospital or a tertiary referral center. It is illogical to assume that the same drug or drugs will be just as effective in one setting as in another, regardless of whether they are used for prophylaxis or an established infection.","1851":"Cryodestruction of hepatic tumors is done by freezing the tumor and an appropriate amount of surrounding normal tissue in situ. The goal is complete destruction of malignant tissue. Local and systemic host mechanisms activated by the cold injury complete the process. Resorption of devitalized tissue and stabilization of the residual scar occurs during the ensuing months. Immune factors may contribute to the long-term process of cryodestruction although such effects are inconstant and ill defined. The purpose of this overview is to delineate the mechanisms of cryodestruction, briefly summarize clinical results and discuss the technique for treatment of hepatic tumors.","1852":"Atremendous demand exists for enhancing the way by which physicians learn new invasive procedures. Appropriate education in new medical and surgical procedures is often outpaced by the desire of physicians to incorporate a procedure in their practice. Computerized surgical simulations have the potential for improving surgical morbidy and mortality. Studies have shown that, for a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, doctors doing their first few to several dozen cases are much more likely to make a greater number of errors. This phenomenon has been referred to as 'the learning curve'. Adequate proctoring of learners by experienced surgeons is cumbersome, as there are few surgeons experienced to proctor their colleagues. It is difficult for physicians, particularly those in rural areas, to travel to larger medical centers for training. The requirement also places a burden on experts who could become overwhelmed with proctoring requests, in addition to leaving their clinical responsibilities.","1853":"Historically, balloons have been used in surgery for a variety of applications. Over the past decades, balloons have been used by surgeons for retaining means (Foley catheter), extraction and occlusion (Fogarty catheter), tamponade (Sengstaken-Blakemore tube) as well as other uses such as dilation and calibration. The pioneering efforts of Gauer and Kieturakis have broadened the use of balloons for a new surgical application - dissection. An important feature of balloon dissection is that it allows the surgeon to create a new operative working space in which a surgical procedure can be performed. Currently, a particularly useful working space is the region immediately outside the peritoneum, frequently termed the extraperitoneal space. A variety of procedures can be performed laparoscopically in the extraperitoneal space such as herniorrhaphy, bladder neck suspension, lymph node dissection, and varicocelectomy.","1854":"The search for the optimal environment that enhances tissue healing is well under way. Since Winter's landmark study over 30 years ago, moist wound healing has become the subject of intensive scientific and clinical research. Numerous studies of molecular and cell biology have demonstrated the benefits of wound healing in a moist environment. The use of occlusive dressings that retain moisture is now accepted as a first line of treatment in the management of a variety of wound types. Clinicians have a myriad of dressing alternatives at their disposal that enable more active control over the healing process. This article reviews the beneficial effects of moist wound healing and the occlusive dressings available to achieve such an environment.","1855":"While the use of external fixators is not revolutionary, the Ilizarov apparatus has dramatically improved the application of the principles of external fixation to the management of bony defects, malunions, infections, and pseudarthroses. Since its formal introduction in Western Siberia in 1951 by Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov, an international cadre of surgeons has employed its methods to pioneer modern limb salvaging procedures. Such techniques are made possible by the numerous advantages, including immediate loading of the limb postoperatively, and the use of healthy viable bone to replace devascularized dead bone \"in situ\" by osteoclasis, localized transport and osteogenesis. Accordingly, leg length discrepancy, deformity and infected nonunions may all be treated effectively. The basic premise of the llizarov technique is that osteogenesis can occur at a surgical osteotomy site given the appropriate degree of retained vascularity, fixation and quantified distraction. This dogma is a function of many variables which Ilizarov classified into three categories; biological, clinical, and technical. First, biologic variables include preservation of endosteal and periosteal blood supply via corticotomy and stable fixation to prevent shear forces, but to permit axial dynamization with postoperative weight bearing. Distraction should occur at approximately 1 mm. per day divided into four times per day. At the termination of distraction, neutral fixation should be permitted to allow strengthening of the new bone. In essence, the technique fools the body into believing it is a child again. The corticotomy sites now act as physes. ","1856":"The indications for performing arthroscopy of the hip are fewer than for the knee and shoulder. Yet, it is a very useful procedure when the occasion arises. The purpose of this article is to present a technique that is simple and safe. The lateral approach over the greater trochanter, not only meets these criteria, but it gives the surgeon enough maneuverability to completely visualize the joint and to perform surgery. ","1857":"Arthroscopic techniques for shoulder arthroscopy have evolved and been refined constantly over the last decade. Significant advances have been made, compared to the first arthroscopic intraarticular examinations on cadavers by Takagi in 1918. Advances in fiberoptics, computer technology, and surgical instrumentation, coupled with innovative ideas and improved operative skills, have opened a new era in the orthopedic evaluation of intraarticular structures and treatment of pathology by the orthopedic surgeon. Arthroscopic examination of the glen humeral joint and sub acromial bursa permits the surgeon to visually assess, document, and treat shoulder pathology in an injury specific manner. Critical to effective use of this technology and skill is a comprehensive and reproducible system for thorough examination and documentation, so that no abnormality is inadvertently overlooked and treatments are effectively performed. In this fashion, standardization is developed for evaluating surgical treatments and providing a common base for professional communication and continued education within the orthopedic community. At the Southern California Orthopedic Institute, a comprehensive 15-point glenohumeral and 8-point subacromial examination from both posterior and anterior portals has been developed and is widely accepted in most arthroscopic forums. The operating room set-up, instrumentation, patient positioning, and the authors' preference for systematic glenohumeral arthroscopy and bursoscopy will be described. Specific methods for-arthroscopic subacromial decompression, distal clavicle resection, and evaluation of the rotator cuff will be outlined. It is imperative that the surgeon have a complete knowledge of normal shoulder anatomy and common variants. ","1858":"Among surgical specialities; orthopedics has been the slowest to embrace the laser as a surgical tool. Although lasers have been used in ophthalmology for over two decades, and laser usage has become commonplace in gynecology, otorhinolaryngology, dermatology, plastic surgery, and general surgery, it is only within the past four years that lasers have attracted appreciable attention in orthopedics. The fact that much of the surgery in the majority of specialities is ablative in nature makes use of the laser particularly appealing, as lasers are the ultimate of ablative tools. Much of orthopedic surgery, on the other hand, is primarily reparative or reconstructive in nature. The re-establishment of continuity or the replacement of tissues such as bone, tendon, and ligament are the goals of the majority of orthopedic surgical procedures. While lasers may ultimately play some role in tissue repair, that role is currently viewed as one of providing precision (for example, nerve and small vessel \"welding\") rather than strength, the latter being crucial in orthopedics. It is, thus, not surprising that the interest in \"orthopedic lasers\" centers around the relatively few procedures that are ablative in nature - intervetebral disc removal, the removal of polymethylmethacrylate, and the majority of arthroscopic procedures. ","1859":"Total joint replacement arthroplasty has been extremely successful since its inception in the 1960's. There have been untoward problems however that have become more apparent with the current state of the art joint replacement. These problems include thigh pain following total hip replacement arthroplasty, proximal bone resorption as a result of stress shielding, and areas of bone lysis. The progressively enlarging size of the metal implant stem with its associated increased elastic modulus has been implicated in the above noted problems. The implant stem as well as metal alloy screws utilized to fix acetabular and tibial plate components to bone have been suggested to contribute to particulate debris and the above noted problems through fretting. Bioresorbable polymers can be utilized as screws to fix the definitive implant to bone as well as utilized as a stem to allow rigid fixation of the implant until there is firm attachment, whether by mechanical or chemical bonding. When the definitive implant has been adequately attached to bone, the resorbable polymer degrades completely, thereby, obviating many of the problems seen with the presently retained screws and large, high modulus, intramedullary stems. ","1860":"Inorganic ceramic compounds have found increasing serviceability as implants in orthopedic surgery and can be classified into general categories using their chemical property characteristics. These characteristics include terms, such as inert, active, and degradable, that normally refer to the ceramics, time-dependent interactions on a relative basis, one-to-another, when implanted in hard and soft tissue sites. The early interest in the high grade (purity and strength) oxide ceramics of aluminum (alumina), titanium [titania], and zirconium (zirconia) was based on information from industrial applications in chemical processing of corrosive solutions. The selection of alumina for high surface area (porous) implants in bone was based partly upon the knowledge that these ceramic materials could maximally resist biodegradation phenomena, while being routinely available at reasonable costs. ","1861":"Computer-driven robots and medical imaging technology may soon enable surgeons to plan and execute intricate procedures with unprecedented precision. Our experience in introducing a robotic system for use in an active role in cementless total hip replacement surgery has convinced us that the marriage of these two technologies-robotics and medical imaging-is likely to change the way many types of surgical procedures are performed. The ability to link an image-based preoperative plan with its surgical execution by a robot may be the key to improved outcomes. Research and development of robotic systems for a wide variety of medical applications is underway at a number of prestigious institutions. Grenoble University has developed the IGOR (Imaged Guided Operating Robot) system. This six-axis robot has performed more than 400 interventions, acting as a positioner for brain surgery in both biopsy and therapeutic procedures. AlephMed and Digital are currently assisting the developers in integrating image analysis into the system. Future development plans include an application for spinal surgery. ","1862":"Economic and clinical factors have placed an increasing emphasis on minimally invasive surgical treatment of lumbar disc herniations. Percutaneous posterolateral techniques have been used increasingly over the last seven years but have definite technical limitations related to location of the disc herniation and its size. Dissatisfaction with percutaneous posterolateral lumbar discectomy (PPLD) led the senior author to explore the possibility of an anterior approach. Preliminary work included a \"hands on\" laparoscopy course and assisting experienced laparoscopists in the operating room. Before authorization from the Palomar Medical Center Investigational Review Board was obtained, dissection of the prevertebral space was performed in a human volunteer and a two level discectomy on a recently deceased patient was carried out in the operating room. The first operation was performed on February 4, 199I. Early in the series, patient selection was identical to that of percutaneous posterolateral discectomy, namely a soft posterolateral herniation contained within the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL). As experience was gained, indications were expanded to include larger disc herniations. A description of the technique and our experience with the initial 21 consecutive cases form the basis of this report. ","1863":"History and development: As we continue to better define the true indications of surgical procedures and ultimately refine these procedures to improve their inherent morbidity, the development of spinal endoscopic techniques continue to enhance minimally invasive surgical procedures. Surgeons desire to define anatomy and to visualize pathology long preceded our ability to utilize sophisticated imaging techniques. Visualization tools using rod-lens technology have been employed for use in the intracranial and in the myeloscopic visualization of neuroanatomy. Pool in 1942 described a large series of myeloscopic inspections of intrathecal normal and abnormal anatomy. His classic diagrams display the presence of disc herniations, arachnoiditis, and spinal stenosis from intrathecal inspections performed through a large bore myeloscope ( Figure 1 ). The continued evolution of myeloscopy was thought to be essential for the treatment of arachnoiditis, large herniated disc disease, and intrathecal tumor pathology. Its complications, however, led to its disuse because of the large bore scope requirements and the morbidity required to insert this instrumentation in the appropriate neural cavity. ","1864":"Lumbar fusion success rates are unpredictable. Turner, reporting on 82 published studies, cites a fusion success rate that ranged from 16% to 93%, mean 66%. Spinal fusion can be compromised by a number of risk factors that have been identified which tend toward a poorer prognosis. These risk factors include smoking, graft type (autograft vs. allograft), and number of fusion levels. Brown reports a statistically different, 32% decrease in spinal fusion healing in smokers as compared to nonsmokers. Allograft has been reported to significantly lower success rate in posterolateral fusions. Autograft is the preferred graft material because it is both tissue compatible and contains viable bone cells. If these bone cells can continue to be viable during the bridging process, the fusion healing process should be enhanced. Allograft bone does not have any viable bone cells within its matrix and may be rejected due to tissue incompatibility issues. Wilkinson reported that each additional fusion level decreased the possibility of spinal fusion success by approximately 20%. Surgeons are attempting various treatment regimens and adjunctive procedures to increase the odds of fusion for these high risk patients. One method is through the adjunctive use of electrical stimulation by pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) following a spinal fusion procedure. PEMFs is an inductive method of generating an electric potential at the fusion site. A pulsing magnetic field surrounding the fusion site through a dual coil system creates an electronegative potential along the fusion site. This negative potential is very similar to the natural property that bone has of healing itself. This technology has proven useful in treating the nonunion of long bone and it seemed reasonable to attempt to improve fusion success rates in spinal fusions given the relative safety of PEMFs and the success noted so far in long bones. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PEMFs in treating spinal fusion patients with one or more high risk factors regardless of the presence\/absence of fixation. ","1865":"Low back pain is a large and increasing cause of workers compensation claims in all industrialized nations. In the United States, 23% of all compensation claims involved back pain. Almost 90% of these were self limiting sprains and strains. It has been estimated that the remaining 10% account for approximately 75% of lost work days, medical costs and permanent disability payments. It is the goal of the spine surgeon to provide the patient with relief from his symptoms and return him or her to the work place. Advances in lumbar skeletal fixation have increased the fusion rate, decreased hospital stay and immobilization and decreased morbidity associated with lumbar spinal fusions. ","1866":"Instrumentation techniques in the cervical spine were first described in 1891. Over 100 years have passed, and many surgeons have made contributions that now allow complicated operations to be performed with predictable results for many conditions affecting the cervical spine. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the currently acceptable techniques of instrumentation and fusion for the subaxial cervical spine. Because different devices are used, depending on whether the spine is approached from the front or from the back, this chapter is divided into those used through anterior and those used through posterior approaches. The decision to approach a given problem anteriorly or posteriorly depends on several factors including the location of the pathology, the nature of the underlying problem, the goals of the operation, and the experience of the surgeon. ","1867":"Few areas of spinal surgery present a greater challenge than management of occipitocervical abnormalities. This is due to the simultaneous presence of two commanding, yet conflicting treatment principles. First, decompression and protection of the spinal cord at this level is synonymous with the presevation of life itself. Second, however, the degree of cervical movements at this junction is unprecedented in the spine, requiring the preservation movement yet stabilization of discrete motion segemnts. The interrelation of these two critical functions is realized in the complex arrangement of the C0- C1-C2 anatomic configuration. The occipitocervical junction is responsible for 50% of the 90 degrees of head rotation. In addition, 10-15 degrees of flexion and extension are added to the subaxial cervical spine by C0-C1-C2.This duality of function is the primary reasin for the complexity of the facet joints in this location. No lateral bending occurs at this level. ","1868":"With the increasing awareness in both the medical community, as well as the general public of the progressive nature of adult scoliosis, more patients with this condition are coming to the attention of the spinal surgeon. With recent technical developments, the surgical armamentarium currently available has certainly improved, yet these patients remain a challenging population of patients. Infantile, juvenile, and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are defined by their age of presentation. Similarly, adult scoliosis is defined as a presentation of scoliosis after skeletal maturity. Yet most studies in the literature define adult scoliosis arbitrarily as scoliosis existing in a patient age 18 or older. The majority of these patients, therefore, have curves which have persisted through adolescence into adult life with etiologies which mirror those of a younger patient population. Degenerative scoliosis related to osteoporosis and iatrogenic causes are additional etiologies of deformity which more typically present in adult patients. The indications for treatment in the adult patient are similar to those in the adolescent: progression of the deformity, pain, deterioration of pulmonary function, and perhaps cosmesis. The complications encountered during the surgical management of these patients is quite high (50-80%) when compared to their adolescent counterparts. Complications include pseudoarthrosis, loss of lumbar lordosis, thromboembolic disease, instrumentation failure, neurologic deficits, and wound infections. Therefore, even with the recent advances in surgical technique the decision of whether or not to operate on a given patient remains the single most critical decision. ","1869":"The transverse rectus abdominus musculocutaneous flap, or TRAM flap, has revolutionized the plastic and reconstructive surgeon's approach to breast reconstruction. Since its first clinical description by Hartrampf, Schellan, and Black in 1982, the TRAM flap has become today's standard for autogenous tissue breast reconstruction. In light of the recent controversy regarding silicone breast implants, the use of autogenous tissue for breast reconstruction has become even more popular. It is the wide belief of most plastic and reconstructive surgeons that, by using autogenous tissue, the reconstructed breast has a more natural shape and contour. Furthermore, patient satisfaction is extremely high and problems inherent with implants, such as capsular contracture, are avoided. With newer technology and a stronger emphasis on self-examination and routine mammographic screening, breast cancer is currently being detected at earlier stages. Because of this, more and more women with diagnosed breast cancer are undergoing breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy. Patients with larger tumors, in more advanced stages, often require a more extensive operation, namely a modified radical mastectomy. The TRAM flap, in an immediate or delayed setting, is an ideal technique for the reconstruction of a modified radical mastectomy defect. We at the Breast Care Center of Mount Zion Medical Center of U.C. San Francisco are extremely pleased with the results of immediate breast reconstruction using the TRAM flap techniques. ","1870":"The type of reconstruction performed following skin tumor surgery is directly related to the type, extent, and site of the skin tumor. The skin tumors with which the plastic surgeon is most often confronted are the basal and squamous cell cancers and melanoma. It is well documented that the incidence of these tumors are increasing at an alarming rate. This is believed to be primarily due to excessive sun exposure and the thinning of the protective ozone layer. Under these circumstances, the plastic surgeon today must be well equipped to not only treat these tumors, as well as other rarer diseases, but also to reconstruct the sometimes challenging resulting defects. The guiding reconstructive principle is as Ralph Millard admonished: Replace lost tissue with like tissue. A skin graft at the tip of the nose can be very distracting due to its patch-like, depressed appearance. In contrast, a full-thickness skin flap would allow the reconstructive \"material\" to blend in with its surroundings for a more impressive result. The plastic surgeon has several items in his armamentarium to assist in the execution of this principle. Some of the techniques are based on age-old ideas, while others represent very recent, almost revolutionary advances. These advances include: 1. The introduction of the tissue expander: This concept has allowed the plastic surgeon to reconstruct defects that would would have normally required disfiguring skin grafts or free tissue transfers. 2. The elucidation of the vascular supply to the skin and underlying muscles and fascia: This knowledge has endowed the plastic surgeon with a tremendous pallet of reliable flaps to reconstruct a particular defect. ","1871":"Body contour surgery concerns the correction of diverse morphological abnormalities of the body which may occur due to various acquired and congenital etiologies. The concept of surgical body sculpting has achieved widespread recognition and acceptance because it safely alters such deformities yielding functionally aesthetic results. Several factors account for the current popularity of body contouring. Foremost among them, is the considerably increased exposure of the body which is seen in most modem cultures, particularly in warm climates. In no other period in the history of western civilization have men and women been so revealingly attired. In addition, today's competitive society strongly encourages the maintenance of a lean athletic body, as a symbol of good health, youth and vigor. The reality of achieving this physical ideal becomes increasingly less likely because of current sedentary lifestyles and dietary excesses. These factors combine to create a disturbing disequilibrium between an individual's desired condition and his actual state. Regular adherence to proper diet and exercise must be stressed, but unfortunately some of these deformities remain resistant to the most sincere of such efforts. Subsequently, there are increasingly greater numbers of people who seek surgical correction for specific abnormalities. Body contour surgery is also an important reconstructive tool in the correction of extremely lax skin in obese patients who have recently undergone dramatic weight loss. ","1872":"A methodical, basic intraoperative transesophageal exam can be performed quickly by anesthesiologists trained in transesophagea1 echocardiography. This provides a wealth of information with minimal invasiveness that is useful for the anesthesiologist, surgeon, and internist involved in the patient's care. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is particularly valuable in the intraoperative monitoring of ventricular volume, ischemia and evaluation of valve morphology. And, as TEE imaging improves it is rapidly replacing aortography as the gold standard in the rapid evaluation of aortic dissection. ","1873":"A modified angioplasty catheter has been developed which can be guided-into position with duplex ultrasound. This reduces the risks of ionizing radiation and contrast agents and uses a modality familiar to the vascular surgeon. This catheter was tested successfully in a canine model for safety, accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. Following FDA approval, clinical trials in humans were initiated. This paper describes the preliminary results with use of this device in humans. ","1874":"Progression in hemodialysis technology and vascular access techniques has led to many patients remaining on chronic hemodialysis for significantly greater periods of time. The surgically constructed arteriovenous fistula at the wrist, mid-forearm, or antecubital fossa presents the most ideal and long-term angioaccess. Adequate radial or brachial arterial flow is mandatory for success, and moderate to large sized patent superficial arm veins are even more critical for immediate and long-term patency. A properly selected and constructed fistula has primary patency rates often exceeding five and ten years. Only 15 percent of the chronic renal failure population are candidates for arteriovenous fistula (autogenous) angioaccess. This percentage is significantly lower in the acutely ill hospitalized individuals who become semiurgent hemodialysis candidates. Resultantly, arteriovenous placement of a non-autogenous expanded PTFE graft has become the modern day mainstay for long-term chronic access construction. ","1875":"New and exciting vascular imaging technologies are assuming increasingly important roles in the management of vascular disease. Non-invasive modalities such as computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and duplex ultrasound supplement the information obtained by invasive techniques including angiography, angioscopy and intraluminal ultrasound. This paper outlines the modem and developing vascular imaging techniques that are rapidly becoming integral components of advanced diagnostic systems as well as therapeutic devices. ","1876":"Most historians feel that history is cyclical and, indeed, circular. The retroperitoneal approach for aortic level surgery emphasizes this phenomenon. Although there has been a great deal of interest in this \"new\" method, it is truly an old approach. Sir Astley Cooper ligated a high lying iliac artery aneurysm through this approach in the early 1800's, while Dulsost reported resection of an abdominal aortic an aneurysm with a homograft replacement achieved through this approach in 1952. In 1963, Rob reviewed 500 of his patients who underwent the retroperitoneal approach for aortic surgery and enthusiastically advocated this approach, because of its lower morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately little hard data accompanied this paper. Ten years later, a large series of 90 patients who underwent aortoiliac reconstruction was reviewed by Helsby, et a1. 1975. In this series he employed a long left paramedian incision to achieve this retroperitoneal exposure of the aorta. A low, 3%, mortality was reported. More recently, Melvin Williams at Johns Hopkins reawakened interest in the retroperitoneal approach when he described a 4% operative mortality accompanying difficult aortic reconstruction. He favored medial rotation of the left kidney so that the aorta could be approached posteriorly. His seminal report of an exceedingly low mortality and morbidity, despite complex aortic anatomy influenced the readoption of this approach by several surgeons. Influenced by his results we adopted the retroperitoneal approach for high risk AAA while Leather and Sicard subsequently reported large series of aortoiliac reconstruction and aneurysms done through this approach. These series were associated with a relatively low mortality and shortened hospital stay (Table I). ","1877":null,"1878":"One problem in vascular surgery today is the effective monitoring of blood flow to distal extremities before, during, and after a surgical reconstruction. Current methods of blood flow assessment such as periodic pulse palpation, skin signs, Doppler sounds, and capillary refill are neither continuous nor objectively comparable. Because of the qualitative nature of these methods, it is difficult to compare measurements taken by different people at different times, making a quick and appropriate response to changing perfusion requirements difficult. In order to address these problems, a system has been designed to monitor and document pulse amplitudes non-invasively. A pulse amplitude monitor system (Figure 1) consists of a pulse sensor and a waveform monitor (Impra, Tempe, AZ). The sensor (Figure 2) contains a piezoelectric film which is used to detect the slight mechanical oscillations of the arterial wall beneath the skin surface. This film is mounted on a compressible foam block which isolates the vibrations and maintains constant force on the skin. The sensor is taped over a distal pulse, typically that of the dorsalis pedis. ","1879":"Debakey, Creech and Morris were the first to report that unrestricted exposure of the distal thoracic and entire abdominal aorta could be achieved by a thoracoabdominal approach with rotation of the viscera from left to right in a plane anterior to the left kidney. Approximately ten years later, Shirkey and colleagues described the technique of transabdominal medial visceral rotation in a plane anterior to the left kidney to expose an injury to the proximal superior mesenteric artery. Shortly thereafter, Buscaglia, Blaisdell and Lim reported their experience in treating 46 patients with penetrating abdominal vascular injuries. They advocated the use of left to right medial rotation of the viscera to approach the aorta and its branches and the use of right to left medial rotation of the viscera to approach the inferior vena cava. They also described modifying the approach, by rotating the left kidney anteriorly and medially to access the posterolateral aorta. Subsequently, transabdominal medial visceral rotation became a popular approach for the treatment of traumatic injuries to the proximal abdominal aorta. The first published description of this approach in the elective sitting came from Crawford who used it to expose complex aneurysms involving the paravisceral and pararenal aorta. ","1880":"Following introduction of the Gore-Tex stretch vascular graft in 1991, over 15,000 bifurcated and 35,000 straight grafts have been distributed (Figure I). This novel graft, recommended for arterial and venous reconstruction, is touted to afford significantly superior handling characteristics, kink-resistance and conformability. In addition, the \"stretch\" feature is thought to confer ease of sizing and anastomotic accuracy. Whether this product of advanced polymer science represents a panacea in the field of vascular grafting or a mere addition to the host of less than ideal synthetic conduits remains to be discerned. The first human implantation of a stretch graft was conducted by one of the authors (R.T.G.) during aortic replacement at the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS). A favorable experience has since been gained by utilization of the stretch graft during vascular reconstruction for aortoiliac, infrainguinal and visceral arterial disease. This review will present the intriguing history of synthetic graft development and recount our experience with the Gore-Tex stretch vascular graft. ","1881":"Anticoagulation is standard therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolic disease. However, in some cases it is unsafe or ineffective. Mechanical interruption of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with the Greenfield filter offers the best level of mechanical protection for these patients. Commonly accepted indications for filter insertion are listed in (Figure 1). The original 24 F stainless steel Greenfield vena caval filter (SGF) has been in use for more than 20 years and a smaller 12 F titanium (TGF-MH) version has been approved for clinical use. The unique geometry of the six-legged conical design allows adequate flow within the IVC even when 70% of the cone is filled with thrombus (Figure 2). Each filter has demonstrated a high rate of caval patency and low rate of recurrent PE. ","1882":"Today's vascular surgeons are no longer confined to the time-honored progressive triad of exercise, medication, and bypass surgery for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Our options have expanded to include primary therapy using thrombolysis, laser angioplasty, atherectomy, balloon dilation, and intravascular stents, most of these tecnological categories featuring several devices from which to select. Coupled with the concomitant development of intraluminal assessment and guidance technologies, namely, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and angioscopy, today's vascular specialists can evaluate atherosclerotic disease with greatly enhanced accuracy, deriving far more specific information about an obstruction than was ever required for classical vascular reconstruction. In the end, this new specialty of endovascular surgery will provide results equal to those methods used in the past but with less invasiveness. All these options and a more complex diagnostic database require coordination if these new resources are to be used to their fullest advantage for maximal revascularization. It is now incumbent upon vascular surgeons to appreciate the strategies for selecting endovascular interventions based upon lesion pathology and desired outcome. ","1883":"Intravascular stents were primarily designed for use in the arterial system, however, there are many venous disorders that may be effectively treated with these devices. Indeed, they have been placed throughout the venous system to treat venous obstruction. Stents have been used in superior vena cava syndrome, catheter induced stenoses of central veins; most commonly subclavian veins, and stenoses of arterio-venous fistulae to name a few common sites. Another major application of stents in the venous system has been in the creation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPs) for the treatment of portal hypertension. There are reports of stents being used to treat obstructive hepatic venous webs (Budd-Chiari Syndrome), May-Thurner Syndrome, and even in the veins of the central nervous system. As experience and follow-up with stents increase, new venous applications will be reported. ","1884":"The congenital abnormality of the pulmonary vessel's development, presented by a direct communication between pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, has multiple pathomorphologic manifestations which lead, in turn, to a wide range of anomalies such as pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM), pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysms (PAVA), pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas, pulmonary angiomas, cavernous hemangiomas and pulmonary-hamartomas (Rozenstrauch et al. 1987: Burke et a1. 1986). ","1885":"The goal of this chapter is to describe the evolution and implementation of several new interventional technologies which expand the capabilities for less invasive coronary artery intervention. These technologies, including excimer laser angioplasty and angioscopy, are based on the use of new fiberoptics and laser technology. While the application of these technologies may appear unrelated, each specialty has borrowed technology and techniques from other disciplines to develop less invasive forms of therapy. ","1886":null,"1887":null,"1888":"Since the first human heart transplantation performed by Barnard on December 3, 1967, cardiac transplantation has now largely entered its third decade of clinical applicability. Up to the end of the seventies, the rather disappointing survival results mainly caused by the limited effectiveness of the immunosuppression therapy available at that time, maintained the clinical use of the procedure to a restricted number of no more than 20 to 30 patients each year world wide. The introduction in 1980 of Cyclosporine in the immunosuppression therapy has produced a tremendous improvement in the survival rate and has since promoted a spectacular resurgence of interest for heart transplantation which is presently a well established therapy for end stage congestive heart failure. Indeed, currently the real limiting factor of the treatment is the limited procurement of donor organs. ","1889":"Open heart surgery is one of the most highly technical of all modern medical techniques, and includes procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting, cardiac valve repair or replacement, correction of congenital defects, resection of aneurysms, ablation of abnormal pathways of conduction, etc. It relies on the coordinated interaction of a heart surgeon, an anesthesiologist, several nurses and technicians, and a perfusionist. The first successful open heart surgery was performed in Philadelphia forty years ago by Dr. John Gibbon, Jr., whose wife, Mary, was his perfusionist. This historical landmark came after two decades of laboratory exploration and perfection of their extracorporeal circuit and its ability to sustain life. Perfusion, the technology which has evolved from those groundbreaking discoveries, controls, supports and maintains the circulation by application of extracorporeal devices. During open-heart surgery, perfusion (cardiopulmonary bypass - CPB) supplants the functions of the heart and lungs to provide the surgeon with a still, dry operating field. Today, this highly specialized role is performed by individuals conversant in a variety of scientific modalities working in close communication and cooperation with the surgeon. Perfusionists understand the anatomy, pathology, and physiology of the patient, while administering medications, anesthetics, blood, blood components and blood substitutes. Simultaneously, they operate a highly sophisticated electromechanical device to substitute for the human heart and lungs. Today's perfusionists know and utilize aspects of varied pursuits which include a functional comprehension of machines and motors, electronics and electrical safety, plastics and biocompatibility, drugs and pharmacology, blood and its components, hemodynamics and fluid dynamics, hypothermia and hyperthermia, gas exchange and metabolism, electrolytes and blood compatibility, anticoagulation and anesthesia. The logarithmic expansion in these unrelated fields of study have enhanced our ability to provide patient care. ","1890":"Although repair of diseased heart valves became possible in the 1940s, replacement of such valves had to await the development and refinement of the heart lung machine, as well as the advent of serviceable valve substitutes. Early investigators were hindered by the idea that alternative valves should closely resemble anatomic ones. Not until the early 1960s, with the introduction of caged- ball prostheses by Harken and Starr, did effective valve replacement become possible. Since that time, substitute heart valves have continued to evolve, and many improvements have been made in their design and fabrication. As of 1988, approximately 51,000 valves were being implanted annually in the United States. ","1891":"In 1993, it is estimated that 2 million Americans are infected with the human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) represents the most severe manifestation of infection with the virus. In the patient with AIDS, helper T lymphocytes are depleted resulting in a defect in cell mediated immunity. The resulting state of profound immunosuppression leads to susceptibility to rare infections and tumors. Although opportunistic infections have been seen in patients on immunosuppressive therapy, those associated with AIDS are much more severe and extensive. Many patients present with symptoms that mimic acute surgical emergencies. In other cases, the presentation has been one of a more chronic disease state. Some of the diseases associated with AIDS are directly attributable to the effects of the HIV virus. In all of these categories, there are some patients who will benefit from surgical therapy. In many cases medical therapy will be more appropriate. The evaluation of these patients can represent a major diagnostic challenge to the surgeon. A familiarity with these disease processes is essential for timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. ","1892":"Management of patients with acute severe liver failure is a major clinical challenge. We need to understand better normal and abnormal liver physiology, develop methods of assessing the degree of liver dysfunction, standardize methods of intervention and develop rational procedures to support the acutely failing liver until it either recovers or is replaced. Investigators have attempted to support animals and patients with liver insufficiency, utilizing various extracorporeal support systems including cross-circulation, whole liver blood perfusion, hemadsorption, hemodialysis, plasma exchange, total body wash-out, use of microsomal enzymes bound to artificial carriers and other. None of these therapeutic modalities succeeded in gaining wide clinical acceptance. Charcoal hemoperfusion has been used to treat severe acute liver failure with mixed results. Although there is clear experimental evidence that the technique has some beneficial effects, a controlled prospective clinical study failed to demonstrate significant clinical advantages. Other methods which relied primarily upon blood detoxification, showed limited success as well. Thus it appears that, at least for now, whole organ transplantation remains the only method with clinically-proven efficacy for treating severe acute liver failure. In attempting to develop systems for temporarily supporting patients until an organ becomes available for transplantation and because of the complexity and vast number of metabolic and other physiologic functions provided by the liver, it was felt that to provide effective ex vivo liver support, either utilization of whole organ perfusion or construction of a liver support system utilizing intact, viable, functioning isolated liver cells will be needed. ","1893":"The number of patients dying from primary malignant tumors of the liver in Japan has steadily increased during the last two decades. There are several epidemiological and clinical characteristics of primary malignant tumors of the liver in Japan, among which are: (I) hepatocellular carcinomas (hepatomas) which comprise approximately 90% of the cases; (2) high association of hepatoma with viral hepatitis and with consequent liver cirrhosis (over 85%); and (3) male predominance (5-6 to 1 male-to-female ratio). In recent years, more and more smaller hepatomas are being detected due to the efficient and liberal use of ultrasonography on high risk patients, and hepatic resections of limited extent such as segmentectomy and subsegmentectomy are now becoming increasingly common surgical procedures. This article will present an overview of current status of treatment of patients with hepatoma in Japan, and the information contained may prove to be useful for clinical management of Western patients, though some of their epidemiological features differ significantly from those of Japanese patients. ","1894":"The study of the immune system on the cellular and molecular level has made significant strides over the past several decades. The role of immune system against infection is self-evident. Although the role of the immune system in the immune surveillance of cancer has not been proven, the immune system is believed to play an interactive role in the regulation of tumor growth. Immunotherapy is the application of the immune system to fight against the tumor. Although immunotherapeutic approaches have been tried in many types of cancer, both malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma seem to show occasional, but definitive response to immunotherapy. The fact that immune eradication of tumor is most efficient when the tumor burden is minimal speaks for the fact that immunotherapy may be most effective for control of microscopic disease. Therefore, to maximize the effect of immunotherapy, the tumor burden needs to be reduced, hopefully to microscopic level either by surgery or in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Also, new strategies are needed to develop more potent vaccines and stimulate effector cells to eradicate tumor cells under the most optimal conditions. ","1895":"During the last two decades increasingly complex surgical techniques have been developed to improve the resection rate in the surgical treatment of cancer. There is an enormous growth in the development of new chemotherapeutic agents, and in the insight in chemotherapy treatment regimens. Since growth factors became available, high dose intensive chemotherapy combined with autologous bone marrow transplant can be performed with a low morbidity and mortality rate. Within radiation oncology technical advances in methods of radiation therapy, including the use of computerized planning (3D) treatment and conformal treatment have decreased the radiation-induced morbidity. To increase the radiation effect, e.g. to improve local control, without increasing radiation toxicity, hyper fractionation, radiation-sensitizers, and radiation-protectors were clinically investigated. New radiation techniques and equipment like brachytherapy (BT) units and intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) became available. All these new techniques are today also used in the treatment of cancer as a combined modality treatment, with the idea to improve the local control rate, the disease free-, and overall survival without increasing or inducing treatment morbidity, and more over to prevent multilating surgical procedures. ","1896":"Significant incremental advances in the use of systemic hormonal therapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer have occurred in the past few years. Benefits of systemic therapy can be broadly divided into two major categories. The first is the favorable impact of systemic adjuvant therapy on recurrence and survival following primary surgical therapy for early stage disease. In this setting, both hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are effective. The results of recent trials as well as an overview analysis of randomized studies, have been able to further delineate, although not unequivocally, for which populations of patients a given type of therapy is most efficacious. Additionally, a more precise estimate of the reduction in odds of relapse and death afforded by a given therapy and within a defined patient subgroups is now possible, and these may be helpful in guiding clinical decision-making. Second, the treatment of advanced metastatic disease remains challenging due to the inability to induce long-term remissions or cures despite common initial responsiveness to hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Over the last decade, only a few new drugs have been approved for the treatment of breast cancer, although several promising chemotherapeutic and biological agents are under scientific and clinical development. The use of therapy in this setting is therefore currently aimed at improving symptoms and quality of life. The use of conventional and novel chemotherapeutic agents at escalated doses with the use of hematopoietic growth factors, peripheral stem cells or autologous marrow support in terms of improved response rates and the potential to prolong survival, achieve long-terms remissions or cures, and improve quality of life is under active investigation. ","1897":null,"1898":"In 1988 two separate technologies were joined together by a team of radiologists in Denver, Colorado: a stereotactic breast biopsy system and an automated biopsy gun system. With the union of these two technologies, a new era in early breast cancer diagnosis began, stereotactic core breast biopsy. Any lesion that can be seen by mammography can be accurately biopsied with the stereotactic core breast biopsy. The accuracy of the procedure depends upon highly developed mammography skills and is, consequently, an advanced radiology procedure. Accuracy is equal to or greater than accuracy with traditional localization and open, surgical breast biopsy. ","1899":"The ability to \"see\" the fetus before birth with routine obstetrical sonography, has changed the management of many congenital anomalies. Although most correctable malformations diagnosed prenatally, are best cared for by appropriate medical or surgical therapy after planned delivery at term, fetal intervention in selected cases may be advantageous. ","1900":"Since the advent of the potent immunosuppressive agent FK 506, intestinal transplantation has become a feasible therapeutic option for patients with irreversible intestinal failure. In this chapter, we present our clinical experience with intestinal transplantation, focusing on the technical aspects of both the donor and recipient operations. The logistics of the operative procedure have been described previously. ","1901":"The goal of pancreatic beta cell replacement therapy is to restore normoglycemia in insulinopenic Type I diabetics patients. Pancreas transplantation is now considered a therapeutic option for Type I diabetic patients. It can no longer be considered an experimental procedure. Although a number of techniques have been applied in an attempt to restore normal glucose metabolism in Type I diabetic patients, pancreatic transplantation is the only therapy that consistently achieves normal glycosylated hemoglobin levels, an accomplishment rarely if ever achieved with frequent insulin injections or insulin pump therapy. Restoration of normoglycemia can be accomplished by either selectively transplanting isolated pancreatic islet cells or by transplanting the pancreas, usually as a composite graft of duodenum and whole pancreas. At this time, the likelihood of achieving independence from insulin is greater with a whole pancreas transplant than with an islet transplant. However, considerable progress in the field of islet transplantation has been made. This chapter will review the state of pancreas and islet transplantation. ","1902":"The replacement of diseased or damaged organs by transplantation became a reality in 1954, when a kidney was transplanted from one monozygotic twin to another. Barring technical difficulties, a graft between genetically identical (syngeneic) individuals is readily accepted and is termed an isograft. An allograft is a transplant between allogeneic (genetically not-identical) members of a given species, whereas a xenograft crosses species lines. Allografts and xenografts provoke a strong immunological response which, unless suppressed, leads to rejection and graft loss. Immunological processes involved in rejection include humoral (B-cell) and cellular (T-cell) components that are both antigen specific and non-specific. 45 years ago Peter Medawar and his colleagues established that rejection has an immunological basis. From studies of skin grafts between animals, they demonstrated that transplantation immunity was actively acquired, systemically propagated and highly specific. Previous exposure to donor antigens was shown to lead to the sensitization of the recipient and resulted in a markedly accelerated rejection upon re-exposure to the same antigens. Also at this time, the possibility of transplantation tolerance, or specific allograft unresponsiveness was first described in an animal bone marrow chimera model. The greatest challenge in clinical transplantation today is to develop in the organ recipient a state of immunologic non-responsiveness to the organ while preserving the ability for immune surveillance and function necessary for life. ","1903":"During the past 30 years orthotopic liver transplantation has become a highly successful form of surgical treatments. The significant advances achieved in this field have led to an increased demand for organs and created a wide gap between organ availability and organ supply. A wider availability of organs for transplantation would allow an expansions rather than a contraction of the indications for transplantation, and, at the same time a relaxation of the patient selection criteria. All these facts clearly justify the renewed interest observed in the last decade in xenotransplantation. The original concept of xenografting, meaning the transplantation of cells, tissues, or organs between different species, is so ancient that it is easily recognizable in Greek and Roman mythology. The centaur Chiron, the teacher of Esculapius, and the Chimera are legendary examples of discordant xenogeneic creatures. However, it is only during this century that scientists have been able to bring this idea into the clinical arena. The early efforts were prompted by the shortage of humans organs at a time when there were few alternatives for treating end-stage organ failure. ","1904":"Even though monopolar electrosurgery has been utilized laparoscopically for over two decades, post procedural complications, including bowel burns, remain significant. Initially employed by gynecologists, electrosurgical cutting and coagulation is rapidly becoming popular with general surgeons and urologists. Electrosurgery in a closed environment presents a special set of problems and in order to prevent complications surgeons need to familiarize themselves with the basic science of electrosurgery and the potential laparoscopic complications. This chapter presents an overview of the physics of electrosurgery with special attention to laparoscopic use. Also discussed are two technologies, a shielding-monitoring system for monopolar electrodes and bipolar electrodes, which minimize and\/or eliminate potential laparoscopic complications associated with the use of electrosurgery. ","1905":"As the minimally invasive approach to surgery has taken a firm foothold the new quest has been to find if there were any limits to procedures being done entirely \"closed\". The obvious patient and cost benefits had already been established, thus many a creative and adventurous surgeon busily explored these possibilities. It has already been demonstrated clinically that laparoscopic tubotubal reanastomosis is feasible and in the experimental setting laparoscopic vesico-urethral anastomosis (following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy), and fetoscopic repair of a cleft lip, all using fine sutures, are possible. The answer seemed to lie in the limitations: setup, skill, technique, visualization, and instrumentation. Problems with visualization have been addressed during the past decade and substantial gains have been made in optical and audio-visual technology. Instrumentation lagged behind, not only because of astronomical demand but also because of the lack of understanding of the exact needs of the laparoscopic surgeon. A good deal of borrowing or adaptation of conventional instruments has occurred which has been beneficial in the sense that these were familiar to surgeon (habit is stronger than logic). The problem was the that highly restricted operative field rendered many of them nearly useless. New instruments had to be developed and many innovative designs have since become available for almost everything but suturing and knot tying. ","1906":"Conventional laparoscopic surgery requires pneumoperitoneum to elevate the abdominal wall for maintaining expansion in an operating field. A continuous insufflation of a noncombustible, soluble gas in a sealed environment is essential. At 15 mm Hg intra-abdominal pressure (the upper limit of intra-abdominal pressure used by most surgeons), significant cardiovascular changes have been observed. These changes are caused by diaphragm elevation and inferior vena cava compression. Elevation of the diaphragm also causes a decrease in tidal volume with resulting pulmonary dysfunction. In conventional practice where C02 is used to create pneumoperitoneum, increased absorption of the gas causes metabolic acidosis and increased intracerebral pressure. Therefore, in patients with intracranial pathology, the use of C02 pneumoperitoneum is not desirable. Compression of the vena cava by pneumoperitoneum results in venous stasis in the lower extremities. Deep venous thrombosis has not been a major problem for gynecologists because pelvic peritoneoscopy is performed in the Trendelenburg position where blood return is enhanced. More lower extremity thromboembolism would be expected when more upper abdominal laparoscopic procedures are performed with the patient positioned in a reversed Trendelenburg position. ","1907":"Laparoscopic surgery imposes limitations on the surgeon not present in open surgery, including restricted degrees of freedom of instrument movement, lack of binocular vision, and severely restricted tactile feedback from the tissues. An aggressive effort is being made to apply technology to overcome some of these limitations and the adaptation of ultrasound probes for laparoscopic use now allows the surgeon to not only examine the surface of structures but to look into them with ultrasonic imaging. Laparoscopic ultrasonography has been used to evaluate the biliary tree during laparoscopic cholecystectomy both to delineate the biliary anatomy and look for common duct stones. This technology may have its widest use in the future in examining the liver for metastatic disease in patients undergoing laparoscopic colon resection. It must be realized that this is a technology in its infancy and further studies need to be done to evaluate areas where laparoscopic ultrasonography will have its greatest clinical utility. ","1908":"The goal of this chapter is to describe the evolution and implementation of several new interventional technologies which expand the capabilities for less invasive surgery. These technologies, including laparoscopic transcystic duct common bile duct exploration, fallopian tube endoscopy, and laser lithotripsy, are all based on the use of new fiberoptics and laser technology. While the application of these technologies may appear unrelated, each specialty has borrowed technology and techniques from other disciplines to develop less invasive forms of therapy. Until recently, transfer of new techniques between different medical specialities has been impeded by a lack of communication. This lack of communication has been a primary impediment to the transfer of enabling technologies from one discipline to another. The Laser Research and Technology Development Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center provides the physical setting and administrative support for collaborative research which emphasizes technology transfer. Focused, well defined research projects are developed to solve a particular problem. New technologies which might provide potential solutions to the problem are systematically examined for feasibility, cost, ease of implementation and application to medicine. Successful application of new technologies to medicine requires a well defined, goal-oriented program with the support of a broadly-based research team including physicists, chemists, engineers, biologists, and physicians. ","1909":"The first laparoscopic exam of the abdominal viscera was done by Keillng in 1902. Since that time, laparoscopy has been used more extensively in abdominal and pelvic disorders by gynecologists and gastroenterologists than general surgeons. However, since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the 1980s by Mouret in France and Muhe in Germany, laparoscopy has been embraced by the general surgeon and has exponentially increased in number and types of procedures being done. New technology, such as the enhancement of video image along with better instrumentation, has further accelerated the acceptance of \"minimally invasive\" surgery in all surgical specialties. ","1910":"Indications and principles of the surgical procedure should be the same for endoscopic and open surgery. Those performing endoscopic surgery should be familiar with the corresponding open procedure, thus being capable to manage complications. Unbiased decision for endoscopic or open procedure might be compromised by lack of experience in one of them. Keeping this in mind, the trauma of surgical access for treatment of some diseases may be diminished by the thoracoscopic approach. There are only few established or almost established indications for thoracoscopic surgery. Since January 1990, we have gained some experience with spontaneous pneumothorax and nodules of the lung. Our patients have been followed-up carefully and the future results will have to be compared with those obtained by conventional surgery (thoracotomy). Our surgical technique and early results will be described in the following. ","1911":"There is no consensus in treating relapsing pneumothorax and pleural effusion. Various types of treatment exist. While open chest surgery with mechanical pleurodesis or pleurectomy is effective, with a recurrence rate close to zero, for patients in poor conditions this treatment may be disadvantageous because of its invasiveness. Therefore minimally invasive techniques using antibiotics, fibrin glue, talcum, kaolin, blood and silver nitrate have been described. Several side effects accompany these agents, and the recurrence rate is between 5-39%. New video-assisted thoracoscopic techniques have enabled surgeons to combine the effectiveness of pleurectomy with minimal invasiveness. Results using these techniques are encouraging. As with open pleurectomy, bleeding complications have been reported, Further disadvantages have to be considered, such as the effect of destroying the parietal layer of the pleura, which may complicate subsequent operations in the thoracic cavity. A technique for avoiding this pleural injury, while maintaining the same efficiency as open pleural abrasion and coagulation is described below. ","1912":"In the extremities, the vascular response to sympathetic stimulation is vasoconstriction with blanching and cooling of skin and increased sweating, whereas, blocking of the sympathetic system results in increased blood flow through cutaneous arteriovenous fistulae and cessation of sweating, thereby, resulting in increased dryness, warmth and accentuation of pink color. In the past, sympathetic denervation of the upper extremity was suggested as a treatment of many disorders; bronchial asthma, essential hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, hyperthyroidism, hyperhidrosis, vasospastic syndromes (Raynaud's disease), thoracic outlet syndrome, causalgia, post-traumatic sympathetic dystrophy (Sudeckatrophy), and angina pectoris. The indications for upper thoracic sympathectomy are limited today to hyperhidrosis, causalgia, severe vasospastic disorders, and ischemic changes of the extremities (Buerger's disease). ","1913":"Thoracoscopy - Looking into the thoracic cavity was first described in 1910 by the Swedish physician, Jacobeus. He used a cystoscope intrapleuraly in order to diagnose pleural diseases. He also used his method for cutting adhesions in order to achieve collapse of the lung in patients with tuberculosis of the lung. Thoracic sympathicotomy was first performed by Kotzareff in 1920. The operation was found to be effective for treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis. Different open techniques for sympathicotomy have since been described, the most common being the dorsal approach by Cloward in 1969. Sympathicotomy was found to be effective not only for palmar, but also axillar hyperhidrosis, vascular insufficiency of the arm and hand, causalgia and angina pectoris (Lindgren 1950). However, the operation using the open technique was difficult and, though effective, not many patients were prepared to meet the demands for problems such as hyperhidrosis. Therefore, the operation became rather common. In the middle of the 1940's, several attempts were made to make the sympathicotomy through thoracoscopic approach and in 1951, Kux described a large number of patients treated in this way for many different diseases such as duodenal ulcer, diabetes mellitus, as well as the generally accepted indications. He published his experiences in a book; but for some obscure reason, his technique did not achieve general acceptance. In the late 1970's and the 1980's, the principle was again taken up by different centers (Byrnes, et. al.). I will describe here a technique which can be regarded as a simplification of previous methods. The technique was elaborated in our department and the first operation was performed in 1987 (Claes, et. al.). By June 1993, six hundred and seventy operations have been carried out. ","1914":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder of the foregut. Over the past twenty-five years the developement of instrumentation and techniques to study GERD have revealed it to be a complex disorder. Increasingly effective pharmacotherapeutics have been developed over the same time frame. As such the great majority of patients are adequately treated by a medical regimen. Patients who are medically refractory or those requiring long term medications are potential candidates for anti-reflux surgery. Over the past decade decreasing numbers of anti-reflux surgical procedures have been performed. The two main reasons are improved pharmacology i.e. Prilosec and the complication rate associated with antireflux surgery. The laparoscopic performance of anti-reflux surgery offers dramatic benefits to the patient. As in the performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomies the decreased postoperative morbidity and rapid return to normal activities ensures overall cost savings. We present our experience with laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery to include the work up, technique, results, and a new laparoscopic anti-reflux procedure. ","1915":"Laparoscopic surgery has been in existence for nearly a century, yet its widespread acceptance and application in the field of general surgery is a relatively recent occurrence. With the rapid acceptance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, surgeons have sought other procedures which would be amenable to laparoscopic approaches. This, combined with a technology boom in laparoscopic instrumentation has made possible the development of advanced laparoscopic procedures such as colectomy. It is important to emphasize that laparoscopic colon surgery is still in an evolutionary stage, and that the procedures described are being continually refined as more experience is gained, as newer instruments are developed, and as software and video applications continue to improve. Nevertheless, the goal of any surgeon performing a laparoscopic procedure should be to perform an operation identical to the one done through a large incision. ","1916":"With the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the general surgery community was introduced to the world of minimally invasive surgery. In less than two years, just about every meeting, journal, and medical trade show demonstrated this \"new\" found technique. Surgeons have been very quick to pick up on the laparoscopic technique, and have actively sought other applications for the laparoscopic approach. With approximately 400,000 inguinal hernia repairs being performed in the United States annually, I the laparoscopic repair of this common malady was very quickly embraced as a possible new application. The concept of a trans-abdominal repair of a hernia defect is not new, having been described as early as the original description of \"the modem day\" hernia repair by Marcey. A trans-abdominallaparoscopic repair has a potential advantage over a conventional groin approach by it's avoidance of the groin incision and the need to mobilize the cord structures. This not 'only minimizes post operative pain, but also the risk of long term morbidity.related to mobilization of the cord. (neuroma formation secondary to injury of the cutaneous nerves, epididymitis and orchitis) There is also the possible advantage of an earlier return to normal activities. In contrast to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there are technical differences between the laparoscopic and open hernia repairs. This difference raises the question as to whether or not the laparoscopic repair will yield results that will compare with an open technique. Open surgical techniques are considered a safe and effective means of treating inguinal hernias. The operation avoids the violation of the abdominal cavity, can be performed under local anesthesia, and is often performed on an outpatient basis. This raises the question \"why via the laparoscope\"? Despite reports from specialized hernia centers reporting a recurrence rate of 0 to 2 percent, large series from community based surgeons continue to report recurrence rates in the range of 5 to 10 percent. This recurrence rate has changed very little since Bassini reported a recurrence rate of 10 percent at the turn of the century. Although the overall morbidity of an open repair is only in the range of 2 percent, this morbidity .consists almost entirely of complications related to the wound and mobilization of the cord structures. The standard open hernia repair is not a perfect operation, and any attempt at its improvement is warranted. Since the laparoscopic repairs approaches the defect from within avoiding a large surgical incision and mobilization of the cord structures, the repair logically makes sense. Despite the intuitive advantages of the laparoscopic repair, questions regarding recurrence rates and safety of the laparoscopic repair still need to be answered. ","1917":null,"1918":"Two years after laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced, and new horizons in laparoscopic surgery were being developed, a noted academic surgeon told me that although he had initially doubted the viability of laparoscopic 'cholecystectomy, he had become an avid supporter. He cautioned, however, that many surgeons would perform the operation with minimal training and marginal laparoscopic skills and that the injury rate would be devastating. Unfortunately, that prophecy has come to pass. In this dissertation, I would like to discuss some of those complications and how to avoid them. I choose not to dwell on minor or peripheral complications such as wound infection, pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection and the like, but rather, concentrate on complications related directly to laparoscopy and Iaparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic complications are either a direct result of poor laparoscopic technique or related to anatomic misidentification. Technical complications include major vascular or intestinal injury or insufflation injury. Anatomic injuries usually involve the bile ducts, ureter or sensory nerves due to poor dissection and identification.

Most of the predictions anticipated in our last writing have been met or exceeded. Change will continue to accelerate, though the individual innovations will be of smaller magnitude. ","1920":"Laparoscopy was developed by Kalk of Germany in 1929 as a routine procedure in internal medicine for diagnosis of liver diseases. Air was insufflated to create the pneumoperitoneum, and an electric lamp was placed at the end of the laparoscope to provide illumination of the abdominal cavity. Entrance into the peritoneal cavity was in the upper abdomen two finger breadths under the ribs. The danger of damaging the bowel by burning, etc. was very low. Previously laparotomized patients were considered an absolute contraindication for Laparoscopy. In 1946 Palmer, France turned the laparoscope from the upper abdomen to look into the lower abdomen. He called this technique Coelioscopy. It was used as for a diagnostic procedure mainly for the sterility patient in Gynecology. For coelioscopy Palmer used the same instruments as were used for Laparoscopy. The danger of burning bowel increased enormously as the protector of the upper abdomen, the omentum, was missing in the lower abdomen.

The primary application of joint replacement technology is at the hip and knee, but arthroplasty of the shoulder and elbow has also made significant advances. Increasing numbers of people are reaching retirement age and require a level of function that will enable their enjoyment of leisure activities such as golf and bicycling. The increased popularity of sports in general also has produced a population of younger adults who need arthroplasty to restore function after a disabling trauma. In addition to patients with traumatic arthritis, patients with crippling arthritis - for example, those affected by rheumatoid arthritis - need more normal function. Thus, there is a great need for total joint replacements that will perform better and last longer.","1924":"Advances in MR imaging, allograft tissue use, and the design of prosthetic implants have dramatically improved survival rates and clinical results in patients with tumours. In younger patients with high-grade sarcomas, adjuvant chemotherapy has increased the chance of survival from 25 per cent to 75 per cent, and tumorous limbs now have a 90 per cent chance of being salvaged.","1925":"Technological advances in the field of spine surgery have most often involved instrumentation. In recent years, a great deal of attention has been focused on variable hookscrew-rod systems, the prototype of which is the Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation (CDI). This French-designed system and similar ones such as the Texas-Scottish Rite (TSRH), or the Isola, provide significantly better fixation and rigidity than has ever been possible, and they allow many patients to be spared the discomfort and inconvenience of post-operative brace or cast support. These features are particularly important for older and chronically ill patients, whose often difficult problems can also be addressed more safely and effectively with this new technology.","1926":"The tremendous surge of interest in sports participation and body conditioning in this country has necessitated technical advances in the field of sports medicine to diagnose and treat a variety of related injuries that are increasingly confronting orthopaedic surgeons. Perhaps the two areas of the body that deserve discussion are the advances in surgery of the knee and the shoulder. In both joints, the development of arthroscopic techniques and treatment has been perhaps the greatest advancement in the past 25 years.","1927":"Recent advances in orthopaedic technology have been among the most exciting medical developments of the past decade. More than 90 percent of the procedures and implants in use today did not exist a decade ago. The development of new prostheses and implants, the modifications of existing ones, and the development of new surgical techniques have allowed orthopaedic surgeons to treat and rehabilitate patients with diseases and deformities that were previously unmanageable. Furthermore, the newer and less invasive procedures have decreased the cost of treatment and recovery time for many patients. Prosthetic joint replacement is now capable of relieving arthritic pain in a predictable fashion, and spinal deformities of any magnitude can be treated in patients of any age with a high probability of success. The reattachment of amputated parts has become commonplace, and techniques of tissue transfer have enabled the salvage and reconstruction of cancerous or traumatised limbs that previously would have been lost to amputation.","1928":"The management of musculoskeletal infection as a result of acute extremity injury remains a challenge to the experienced surgeon. The current treatment of acute debridement and wound irrigation remain the most important factors in the prevention of acute or chronic infection. Skeletal stabilisation and appropriate soft tissue coverage are also imperative in the standard care of these complicated traumatic wounds. Once stabilised, severe open fractures remain at risk as a result of the compromised vascularity of the bone and soft tissue. Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended as a prophylaxis to the open wound contamination. In such injuries the therapeutic levels of the antibiotics are frequently diminished by the impaired tissue perfusion, vasospasm, edema and vascular damage.","1929":"Injury to the spinal cord is catastrophic and usually permanent. Whereas other injured tissues, such as bone, skin, blood vessels and peripheral nerves, are capable of being repaired and resuming near normal function, such is not the case with the spinal cord. Thus far, all attempts to repair the cord using every conceivable technique has ended in failure. The physician and other members of the treatment team involved with a patient with spinal cord injury, must deal with permanent, long-term consequences of the injury.","1930":"Spinal medicine is one of the most rapidly evolving specialities of surgery and of medicine. The more critical and life saving specialties seem to have evolved first. General surgery, of course, existed for decades before the vascular and cardiac surgeon evolved in the 1950s and 1960s. Hand surgery and total joint surgery was in its heyday by the early 1970s. Spine surgery did not become a recognised specialty by the Academy of Orthopedic Surgery until almost 1990.","1931":"Anatomical channels connecting the left ventricular chamber to the myocardial sinusoids supplying the left ventricle with oxygenated blood in the human heart were described by Dr Wearn in 1933. He microscopically confirmed these communicating vessels or tiny clusters of arteries by gelatin filling. The second type of these channels was located at the end of the vessels almost as though woven into the fabric of the muscular fibres. These irregular shaped blood vessels were called myocardial sinusoids. Three other early investigators described connecting channels. The first was Adrian Christian Thebesius, a Dutch physician in 1708 who described connections from the atrium the coronary veins which were called Thebesian veins. The second was the American physiologist F H Pratt who, in 1898, perfused blood though the ventricle alone in a cat, keeping it alive for more than an hour. Finally, the historical work of R T Grant who in 1926 reported that a congenitally deformed heart in a child had connecting cavities with the surrounding veins and arteries.","1932":"On January 8, 1985, Carpentier and his cardiovascular surgery group at the Broussais Hospital were the first to replace diseased human myocardium with a stimulated latissimus dorsi muscle flap. A few months later, Magovern and co-workers at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh were the first to repair a large left ventricular aneurysm with a latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty. Over the past six years, approximately 120 patients have undergone the operation throughout the world.","1933":"The human heart is a brilliant example of biological engineering. Its four engineering components, when properly integrated, is a marvel of a rugged, high performance, self regulating biological pump. The components of the heart are conduction system (rate control), coronary circulation (fuel supply), valves (directional flow) and muscle (power and force). The breakdown of any component part and failure of proper system integration leads to reduced pumping performance and appearance of clinical symptoms. Effective treatment exits for the failure of three of these components - valve repair and\/or replacement; coronary artery bypass, angioplasty or pharmacologic intervention; and pacemakers and drugs for conduction problems.","1934":"Left ventricular assist device (LVADs) have been used with increasing frequency since the late 1980s. Technology has improved these devices to make them less thrombogenic and has decreased their size to allow greater application. By definition, the LVAD only assists or supports the pumping function of the left ventricle, unlike cardiopulmonary bypass which provides total circulatory and pulmonary function. LVADs support the circulation for hours to days and occasionally for weeks when the left and\/or right ventricle has failed and is therefore unable to sustain the circulation. The hope is that by temporarily supporting the circulation, ventricular function will return. In other instances, LVAD type devices (also known as prosthetic ventricles) are used to 'bridge' the time until a suitable heart donor can be located for transplantation.","1935":"Treatment of congenital cardiac disease has been marked in the recent decade by a movement towards treatment in early infancy, the development of techniques of radical palliation for conditions previously inoperable and the emergence of transplantation as a viable alternative.","1936":"A goal of this article is to demonstrate how easily angioscopy can be incorporated into coronary artery bypass grafting. Intra-operative angioscopy has been used in a number of applications including prebypass arterial evaluation, inspection of the interior of the vein graft, examination of graft to coronary anastomoses and outflow. And adjunctive guidance during adjunctive revascularisation procedures. Despite promising initial trials of the use of intraoperative angioscopy, this technology has not been widely adopted because of perceived demanding technique, excessive effort required, and potential complications. Moreover, the possible benefits of the additional information gained during cardiac surgery operations have thus far only been partially demonstrated.","1937":"Implantable devices are now being routinely used for the treatment of patients with malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This technology became an approved clinical therapy in the United States in 1985. The prototype implantable cardioverterdefibrillator ICD was developed in the 1970s and investigated in the 1980s. Since its approval in 1985 for general clinical application, ICDs are being increasingly used in patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias based upon a number of clinical trials undertaken in North America and western Europe.","1938":"The implantable pacemaker, like the telephone, has evolved from a rather straightforward device, which offered virtually no choice to its early users, to a highly complex system embodying a number of choices, many of which must be made at the outset because they affect the performance of the system throughout its lifetime. The most important of these choices, is, of course, selection of the mode of pacing and its relationship to the underlying arrythmia. These considerations are discussed in considerable detail in Dr Nora Goldschlager's article on electrophysiology, and will not be repeated. The focus of this discussion will be on surgical techniques of implantation, particularly as related to the evolution of the modern lead system.","1939":"Once the decision has been made to implant a permanent pacing system for the management of symptomatic bradycardias, a clinical assessment of the patient's physiological needs must be made together with a systematic determination of the pacemaker features that can best meet those needs. The primary clinical objectives should be the restoration and maintenance of optimal cardiac function, so as to enable the patient to be as active as possible. Unless the clinical goals are clearly defined and the physiological consequences of various pacemaker features understood, the implanted system may not fully benefit the patient, or may even exacerbate the patient's symptoms. Clinical assessment usually includes an ambulatory electrocardiogram to document the occurrence, frequency, and type of tachycardia, and an exercise test to assess the presence of 'chronotropic incompetence,' defined as inability to increase heart rate in response to increased metabolic need.","1940":"Over the past 12 years, the development and widespread use of new interventional techniques has widened the indications for the use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in the treatment of totally occluded coronary arteries. In the early reports of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Registry investigators recommended that angioplasty should not be attempted in coronary total occlusions. However, with improvements in operator skills, advanced catheter technology, and most notably, with the development of steerable guidewire systems, angioplasty is now being used to treat totally occluded arteries in an increasing number of patients.","1941":"An arterial embolus is an obstructive segment of material which travels along the bloodstream until lodging in an artery which is too small in diameter to permit its passage. The embolus will halt flow of oxygenating blood to all tissue beyond the point of obstruction. Blood distal to the obstruction will stagnate and thrombose - or clot in place, effectively propagating the obstructive material along the artery. Arterial embolism poses a threat to both life and limb and prior to the mid-1960s was difficult for surgeons to treat because there was no simple and effective means to remove the embolus and associated distal thrombus.","1942":"The technical feasibility of surgical correction of abnormal venous valves is now established. In times past, it was generally thought that surgery inside the veins would be fraught with a virtual certainty of failure due to thrombosis of the vein. This has turned out to be not true. In 1968 the first venous valvuloplasty was done and since then hundreds more have been reported from surgeons in America and Europe with a very rare incidence of post-operative thrombosis. The operation is done today by any vascular surgeon who has taken the time to study the details of technique that are necessary to achieve a successful repair.","1943":"Interest in deep venous reconstruction for severe chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is burgeoning. Vein valve transplantation for deep venous valvular incompetence, an indirect method for correcting deep venous valvular incompetence achieves its physiologic benefits by placing a normal functioning valve harvested from the upper extremity into the deep system. By contrast, other authors in this volume have presented alternative forms of deep venous valvular reconstruction where the valve mechanism itself is directly repaired or a local segment of vein containing a functioning valve from the same anatomic area, such as the saphenous or profunda, is transposed into the deep venous circuit. Several factors influence the role of deep venous valvular surgery and its frequency. For example, the incidence of deep venous involvement in patients with advanced stage II or frank ulceration (stage III) is variable and depends upon patient selection process.","1944":"The surgery of venous disease falls into two distinct categories, the removal of malfunctioning unsightly superficial veins and the restoration of the function of the deep veins by repairing or replacing valves or bypassing obstructions. During the past decade surgical advances have mainly been concerned with the refinement of techniques to reduce the cost of surgery and its outward and visible manifestation - the scars, rather than the introduction of new principles or objectives.","1945":"With the advent of carotid arterial operations, concerns of interruption of cerebral perfusion and ischemic injury loomed as the major deterrent. The physiologic basis for cerebral protection is to diminish its oxygen requirement by chemical or hypothermic means or to continue its adequate arterial perfusion. The first successful carotid reconstruction resecting an internal carotid stenosis with anastomosis of the patent external carotid to the distal internal carotid artery was performed by Carrea of Argentina in 1951. Preoperatively, ascorbic acid and phenobarbital was given but its rationale was not explained.","1946":"Carotid endarterectomy is a prophylactic operation that is designed to prevent strokes related to atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid bifurcation. Once a plaque is safely removed, a major potential cause for stroke in that patient is eliminated. However, the operation itself carries two major risks: death and stroke. These risks are related to patient selection and technical expertise in the performance of the operation. This chapter will focus upon those aspects of surgical technique, when properly applied, that can minimise the risks of surgical complication and thus permit the operation to achieve its highest potential of stroke prevention.","1947":"The interruption of blood flow causing ischemia is usually the result of an intrinsic obstruction of major arteries by clots. Emboli that originate in the heart are the main cause of such obstructions, and patients who have had myocardial infarcts or have stenosis of the mitral valve or arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation are susceptible to the development of clots within the heart which can lead to distal thromboembolism. Another common cause of arterial obstruction is the formation of clots in an area of narrowing caused by arteriosclerosis.","1948":"Vascular surgeons have always been concerned with the intra-operative assessment of their reconstructions. Failure of vascular reconstructions in the early post-operative period is most commonly a result of a technical error at the time of surgery. Hence, any technique which aids the vascular surgeon in evaluating his reconstruction and in preventing technical errors will be beneficial to both the surgeon and their patient. Traditionally, intra-operative arteriography has been the 'gold standard' for evaluating vascular surgical procedures.","1949":"Endovascular is an increasingly popular term that describes the use of catheter-based instruments to diagnose and treat vascular disease. Implicit in this terminology is its association with techniques that are less invasive to the patient than traditional surgical techniques. Endovascular techniques began in 1963 with the advent of the Fogarty arterial embolectomy catheter for removal of clotted blood from the peripheral arterial circulation. Shortly thereafter, radiologist Charles Dotter introduced the concept of arterial dilatation which was popularised a decade later by cardiologist Andreas Gruntzig with the use of a non-dispensible plastic balloon catheter. During the next two decades, endovascular techniques proliferated in the growing fields of interventional cardiology and interventional radiology, yet were embraced more slowly by the surgical community.","1950":"The potential for precise tissue ablation via a miniaturised delivery system (i.e. fibre optics) makes laser angioplasty a promising alternative for treatment of atherosclerotic occlusions which are not amenable to current forms of therapy. This is a particularly relevant consideration since the majority of developing angioplasty devices aside from balloons are difficult to miniaturise in a cost-effective manner. The utility of contemporary devices is restricted to stenotic or short occlusive lesions, with a high rate of early recurrence of lesions being a significant limiting factor in most locations. In order to address and resolve the current deficiencies and define the potential of lasers as an angioplasty device, it is first appropriate to overview the current status and define unresolved issues.","1951":"During the early years of vascular prosthetic development (1940-1960), the characteristics of the ideal graft were gradually defined. In order to be clinically useful, a vascular graft must be readily available in a variety of sizes and lengths and be suitable for use throughout the body.","1952":"The vascular laboratory as a recognised entity is, at best, only 15 years old. Many growing technologies were applied prior to this time, but it was not until the addition of Doppler ultrasound to the vascular surgeon's armamentarium that non-invasive diagnosis began to take hold. The vascular laboratory was necessary because angiography, which was felt to be the gold standard by many, was expensive, had the risk of potentially serious complications, and did not have the characteristics of a test which made it easily repeatable at frequent intervals. Most importantly, angiography was an anatomic evaluator and provided minimal information regarding function. Although pathologic anatomy and function are often related, the relationship is sufficiently weak to dictate the need for an accurate method of functional evaluation. This was the role of the early vascular laboratories. Today's vascular laboratory provides both functional and anatomic information. In some cases, the anatomic information is superior to that which can be obtained from angiography.","1953":"'All change is a miracle to contemplate; but it is a miracle which is taking place every instant.' Henry David Thoreau, Walden, 1854. Progress in vascular surgery is fuelled by technology. Every advance in modern vascular surgery has been preceded by a technological development which, though apparently amazing, soon became a commonplace. Those who do not believe in change in vascular surgery or that technological advances described in this volume will have any place in the treatment of vascular disease, reflect an attitude described best by Lord Moynihan, then President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He said, 'surgery ... has now almost reached its limit...we can surely never hope to see the craft of surgery made much more perfect than it is today.' Changes which have occurred since that statement are a cascade of advances including antibiotics, anticoagulants, prostheses, sutures, needles, and a variety of scopes which have become as common as aseptic technique.","1954":null,"1955":"There are still situations in surgery when diffuse bleeding becomes a severe problem. This may occur especially during operations involving parenchymal tissue and, or in cases of impaired haemostasis. Several methods are available to control diffuse bleeding, and in addition to classical methods like sutures or tamponade, there are essentially two approaches: -Application of physical methods (e.g. electro-coagulation and infra-red-coagulation) -Application of local haemostyptic materials.","1956":"Chronic, non-healing wounds have been a challenge to surgeons for years. Physicians get frustrated trying multiple modalities to heal the wounds with varying degrees of success. Patients and their families get impatient and depressed because the wounds will not heal. Hospitals in the US lose money on these patients because so many of them are in the Medicare population and require lengthy hospitalisations. Third party payors spend inordinate amounts of money on these patients since they require on-going care even though they are not healing. This scenario is a major challenge in health care today as we face caring for an aging population more prone to chronic wounds.","1957":"Haemorrhage often leads to shock with complications of acidosis, hypothermia and coagulopathy. Despite massive transfusions and supposedly adequate volume replacement, patients that are acidotic and hypothermic still develop clinically significant bleeding and clotting problems attended by a high mortality.","1958":"Early attempts at blood salvage during surgery shared many of the complications associated with the development of cardiopulmonary (heart-lung) bypass machines; especially, coagulopathy and air embolism. By the late 1970s, the technology had developed to the point where not only were the red blood cells salvaged, but washed and processed in a manner that prevented auto-immunisation, transfusion reactions, and transmission of diseases. Blood conservation became practical.","1959":"The popularity of Endoscopy for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures is a result of advanced development of new technologies, such as industrial video and fibre optics. Surgeons have 'new sets of eyes' and therefore it becomes necessary to familiarise ourselves with articulating instruments while looking at a television monitor not at the surgical sight. With the field of endoscopy evolving so quickly, it is imperative for the surgeon to adapt his or her technology to optimise patient gain and minimise procedure risk. If new technology is ignored, the.disservice is done both to the physician and the patient. 'If you do not become part of steam roller, you become part of the road.","1960":"Although the need for an alternative to red cells for transfusion has been recognised since the initial description of the circulation of the blood by William Harvey in 1628, there is still no approved product available to clinicians. Recent concern over the safety of human blood has stimulated a renewed interest in finding alternatives to transfusion of red cells. Two types of solutions, those based on perfluorocarbons and those based on haemoglobin are currently being aggressively developed.","1961":"The frequency with which hepatic resection is undertaken has rapidly expanded. This is due to a better understanding of hepatic anatomy and physiology, and a better appreciation of the indications for resection. As a result of Foster's liver tumour survey of 1974, and Adson's early publications hepatic resection has become almost commonplace. However, though the mortality of the procedure has decreased to five to 10 per cent, the morbidity continues to range from 20 to 27 per cent, Ultrasonic dissection has the unique potential to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this procedure by minimizing blood loss and creating a controlled operative event.","1962":"The applications of sonography multiply year by year. The technology initially progressed from a simple A-mode signal, to contact scanners which produced B-mode images. These, in turn, were supplanted by real-time instruments capable of defining motion. The next development was the duplex Doppler machines which characterised flow from an image in a specific area. Now, colour coding of vascularity and high resolution imagery have become the standards of excellence.","1963":"The development of an infection in the vicinity of an implanted medical device is a dramatic event in many fields of surgery, especially cardiovascular, orthopedic and neurosurgery. The diagnosis of these infections is usually difficult and their treatment is always complex and represents a challenge for both surgeons and infectious diseases specialists. As foreign materials are used with increased frequency in modern medicine, this problem will probably remain a major one in the future despite the improvement of techniques and the use of new antibiotics. For patients, infection of a prosthetic device often means the loss of its function and. is sometimes associated with a high mortality.","1964":"The number of antimicrobial agents that have been introduced into clinical practice continues to increase. This development, however, is not unique to the antibiotic field. All one has to do is to look at the burgeoning number of compounds for antiinflammatory or cardiovascular indications to recognise that the pharmaceutical industry continues to provide us with new compounds of increased potency and broadened therapeutic applicability. On the other hand, not all new drug introductions represent clinical breakthroughs. Some agents can be, quite frankly, classified as 'me too' drugs. Nonetheless, even a fairly simple congener could be a welcome addition to the therapeutic armamentarian if it is safer, less toxic, cheaper, and more convenient to use than previously available therapy.","1965":"There has recently been an increased interest in the safety, efficacy and relative ease in the delivery of intraspinal analgesics for the control of intractable pain. Recent technological advances have provided clinicians with precise and accurate delivery systems for long term infusion of spinally administered drugs. Because of these advances, there has been a rapidly growing interest in long term intraspinal infusional therapy for the control of chronic pain.","1966":"Given the anaesthesiologists 'credo 'vigilance' it should come as no surprise that monitoring is accorded high priority in anaesthetic practice. Although the critical basics of monitoring have changed little since the earliest days of the specialty, namely visual observation (i.e. skin colour, rate and depth of respiration, position and location of patient and endotracheal tube etc.) and physical contact with the patient (i.e. finger on the pulse for heart rate and estimation of blood pressure, temperature, peripheral perfusion etc.) there is no question that technological advances have greatly enhanced these basic observations. The 1980s were especially pivotal. In this decade major advances have been made in respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring. Many of these advances have been credited with facilitating a major reduction in perioperative anaesthetic morbidity and mortality. For instance, with the routine use of pulse oximetry and capnography, the chance of an unrecognized esophageal intubation of sufficient duration to result in anoxic brain damage have been almost eliminated.","1967":"Functional failure of one vital organ results in death. The surgical implantation of tissue with the capacity to replace lost organ function, from one individual into another, is termed transplantation. In Boston, in 1954, Joseph E Murray performed the first successful human organ transplant, that of a kidney from an identical twin into his brother.","1968":"Medical practice is generally divided into medical and surgical sub-groups based on therapeutic approaches. Physicians in medically oriented specialities, such as internal medicine and paediatrics, traditionally rely largely on drugs to influence the course of disease while general and speciality surgeons usually have some type of surgical procedure at the core of their discipline. (Obviously, these are gross generalisations; surgeons have long been at the forefront of the use of antibiotics and nutritional support.) But these distinctions are becoming increasingly blurred as cardiologists guide catheters into ever smaller vessels and gastroenterologists send fibreoptic scopes into yet other ducts and snare would-be cancers from ever more remote parts of the gut. The recent explosion in scientific knowledge will continue to fuel this trend. Greater understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of disease inevitably leads to a simpler approach to diagnosis and therapy.","1969":"The surgical principles in the treatment of cancer were first clearly enunciated in 1906 by Halsted in the treatment of carcinoma of the breast, namely wide surgical removal of the breast together with the regional lymph nodes to which it spreads. The hope was that the regional nodes would serve as filters and prevent the spread of malignant cells into the blood stream, enabling the surgeon to excise every last cancer cell from the patient, thereby curing the cancer.","1970":"Almost from the moment of its invention, the laser was destined to play a significant role in surgery. This intense new source of coherent, radiant energy inevitably attracted the attention of imaginative physicians and surgeons, who immediately recognised its potential for precise removal of diseased tissue.","1971":"Pacific Transplant Institute, California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco Orthotopic hepatic transplantation provides hope for patients with irreversible liver disease, and the operation is becoming more accepted by the medical community and the public in general. Still, the operation is difficult and the postoperative and long-term management can be rather complex. Unlike pancreas, kidney and heart transplantation, liver transplantation lacks a back-up system, such as Insulin, dialysis or a ventricular support device, if graft failure occurs. Therefore, the Slightest error in the management of the patient after hepatic transplantation may prove fatal. Complications during the post-operative period often originate from the time of the procurement and\/or transplantation operations. Thus, good techniques are crucial for a satisfactory outcome.","1972":"Over the past 10 years there has been a rapid increase in the application of single lung, double lung and heart\/lung transplantation to patients with a variety of end-stage cardiopulmonary diseases. As a result there has been a significant expansion in our knowledge of these procedures and their potential therapeutic role, limitations and complications.","1973":"Regional perfusion of cancer resulted from studies that infused nitrogen mustard into arteries supplying tumours while at the same time blocking the venous return to maximise exposure of the tumour to the chemotherapeutic agent.","1974":"The emergency management of patients with acute variceal bleeding has evolved dramatically over the past 20 years. Initially, bleeding was controlled by supportive medical measures in conjunction with surgical portal decompression procedures. However, the high operative mortality and the significant incidence of post-operative encephalopathy associated with emergency portal decompression led to the development of alternative therapeutic techniques. Injection sclerotherapy has been used in large numbers of patients for the past 10 years with considerable success and is now advocated by many authors as the treatment of choice for acute variceal hemorrhage. While sclerotherapy controls bleeding in approximately 70 per cent of patients, repeat sessions are necessary in 20 per cent and sclerotherapy may be unsuccessful in 10 per cent. When sclerotherapy fails, most authors recommend surgical shunting. While the side-side portacaval shunt is still the most popular operation in this setting, other types of shunts have been advocated by some authors. A small mesocaval or portacaval H-graft, or a distal splenorenal shunt may he performed in an attempt to reduce the incidence of post-operative encephalopathy and liver failure.","1975":"Few technologic advances in medicine have captured the imagination of the general public, and physicians, to the extent that the laser has. The laser clearly evokes images of space-age technology, and is frequently regarded as a panacea by patients. The reality is, of course, that the laser has no inherent special ability to cure diseases, and is simply another tool available to contemporary surgeons. We will review the current application of lasers in head and neck oncologic surgery. The basic mechanism of lasers will be discussed, with emphasis on the carbon dioxide (C02) laser. This discussion will include analysis of photodynamic therapy for cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, which is rapidly evolving as a means of incorporating lasers in the treatment of head and neck cancer.","1976":"Approximately 100,000 new cases of primary hyperparathyroidism are diagnosed in the United States each year. Thus a disorder that was once considered to be rare is now known to be relatively common. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are diagnosed today with only minimal hypercalcemia (serum calcium less than 1mg\/dl above the upper limit of normal) and many have few or no classic symptoms or clinical manifestations of hyperparathyroidism, such as kidney stones or osteitis fibrosa cystica. Many patients with hyperparathyroidism today have fatigue or increased lethargy, muscular weakness, bone or joint pain and depression. It is difficult preoperatively to know whether these clinical manifestations are related to the primary hyperparathyroidism or not. Our own studies suggest that in about 80 per cent of patients with hyperparathyroidism the preoperative symptoms either improve or disappear after parathyroidectomy.","1977":"Quadrantectomy describes removal of the quadrant in which a breast neoplasm is located, by excision of skin overlying the tumour en bloc with the sub-cutaneous fatty tissue and a relatively large area of the mammary gland, including the corresponding parts of the fasciae of the major pectoralis muscle.","1978":"Trauma surgery originated with military surgeons who cared for otherwise healthy young males injured in combat. During the past two decades, many areas of the United States have established trauma systems, organised to sift seriously injured patients of all ages to trauma centres that have the medical personnel and equipment needed to provide immediate trauma care. The organisation of trauma care has greatly increased the experience of civilian surgeons based at designated trauma centres, and has lead to a recognition of three 'special care' areas of trauma surgery: paediatric trauma, geriatric trauma, and trauma during pregnancy.","1979":"Endoscopic cannulation of the biliary tree and the pancreatic duct (ERCP) was first described in 1968. Six years later the technique of endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) opened the door to endoscopic treatment procedures of pancreatic and biliary diseases. Techniques have been developed to remove bile duct stones, to break large stones and to drain bile duct or pancreatic duct strictures.","1980":"Flexible upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has a well established place in the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Increasing experience with a variety of modalities has made endoscopic therapy appropriate for many significant bleeding lesions of the upper GI tract. In many instances endoscopic therapy will eliminate the need for surgical control of the bleeding lesion. In other patients the temporary endoscopic control of bleeding may allow appropriate surgical intervention to be postponed until optimal stabilisation can be accomplished.","1981":"Video controlled laparoscopy has dramatically changed general surgery. Further striking alteration is sure to occur in the immediate future. Not only are the surgeons who are concentrating on this area making great strides, but innovative equipment and technological innovation are certain to make more complex procedures feasible. Thus the future of laparoscopic surgery is very bright.","1982":"Management of gallbladder disease has changed dramatically since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in 1988. Removal of the gallbladder has always been the 'gold standard'. However, the morbidity associated with the large transrectus incision has caused patients and referring physicians alike to refrain from surgical treatment whenever possible. LC offers the same excellent end results of a standard cholecystectomy, but without the pain and ileus seen with the operation.","1983":"The replantation of amputated parts has stimulated the imagination of writers since antiquity. It was not until the successful replantation of an arm by Malt and a hand by Chen Chung Wei in 1953 that these fables became reality. The simultaneous development of the field of microsurgery permitting the repair of one millimetre vessels made possible the replantation of structures fed by these small vessels such as fingers, ears, noses, lips, scalps and penises.","1984":"The incidence of breast cancer in the United States is high and appears to be increasing. The American cancer Society has estimated that one in nine American women (11 percent) will eventually develop breast carcinoma. Recently there has been a dramatic shift away from mastectomy and toward breast-conserving therapy (Iumpectomy, axillary node dissection and whole breast irradiation). In some centres the majority of breast cancer patients are now treated with conservation therapy. Some patients, however, are not candidates for radiation, because of the size, location or histology of their tumour and are still best treated by mastectomy and reconstruction. Women who develop local recurrence following radiation therapy are likewise candidates for mastectomy with reconstruction. Additionally, there is a large group of women who had mastectomies in years past who have not had reconstruction. Thus many patients may potentially benefit from breast reconstruction.","1985":"New developments in computerised tomography (CT) imaging technology have paralleled advances in craniofacial surgical techniques. The ability to reconstruct congenital, neoplastic, and traumatic deformities is dependent upon good pre-operative assessment.
