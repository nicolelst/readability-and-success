multicellular organisms, endocrine factors such as hormones and cytokines regulate development and homoeostasis through communication between different organs. For understanding such interorgan communications through endocrine factors, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serves as an excellent model system due to conservation of essential endocrine systems between flies and mammals and availability of powerful genetic tools. In Drosophila and other insects, functions of neuropeptides or peptide hormones from the central nervous system have been extensively studied. However, a series of recent studies conducted in Drosophila revealed that peptide hormones derived from peripheral tissues also play critical roles in regulating multiple biological processes, including growth, metabolism, reproduction, and behaviour. Here, we summarise recent advances in understanding target organs\/tissues and functions of peripherally derived peptide hormones in Drosophila and describe how these hormones contribute to various biological events through interorgan communications.","1":"Animals adapt to their environments in the course of evolution. One effective approach to elucidate mechanisms of adaptive evolution is to compare closely related species with model organisms in which knowledge of the molecular and physiological bases of various traits has been accumulated. Drosophila elegans and its close relatives, belonging to the same species group as the model organism D. melanogaster, exhibit various unique characteristics such as flower-breeding habit, courtship display, territoriality, sexual dimorphism, and colour polymorphism. Their ease of culturing and availability of genomic information makes them a useful model for understanding mechanisms of adaptive evolution. Here, we review the morphology, distribution, and phylogenetic relationships of D. elegans and related species, as well as their characteristic flower-dependent biology, food habits, and life-history traits. We also describe their unique mating and territorial behaviours and note their distinctive karyotype and the genetic mechanisms of morphological diversity that have recently been revealed.","2":"Adult tissues in Metazoa dynamically remodel their structures in response to environmental challenges including sudden injury, pathogen infection, and nutritional fluctuation, while maintaining quiescence under homoeostatic conditions. This characteristic, hereafter referred to as adult tissue plasticity, can prevent tissue dysfunction and improve the fitness of organisms in continuous and\/or severe change of environments. With its relatively simple tissue structures and genetic tools, studies using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have provided insights into molecular mechanisms that control cellular responses, particularly during regeneration and nutrient adaptation. In this review, we present the current understanding of cellular mechanisms, stem cell proliferation, polyploidization, and cell fate plasticity, all of which enable adult tissue plasticity in various Drosophila adult organs including the midgut, the brain, and the gonad, and discuss the organismal strategy in response to environmental changes and future directions of the research.","3":"Genetic screens are used in Drosophila melanogaster to identify genes key in the regulation of organismal development and growth. These screens have defined signalling pathways necessary for tissue and organismal development, which are evolutionarily conserved across species, including Drosophila. Here, we have used an FLP\/FRT mosaic system to screen for conditional regulators of cell growth and cell division in the Drosophila eye. The conditional nature of this screen utilizes a block in the apoptotic pathway to prohibit the mosaic mutant cells from dying via apoptosis. From this screen, we identified two different mutants that mapped to the Hedgehog signalling pathway. Previously, we described a novel Ptc mutation and here we add to the understanding of disrupting the Hh pathway with a novel allele of Cos2. Both of these Hh components are negative regulators of the pathway, yet they depict mutant differences in the type of overgrowth created. Ptc mutations lead to overgrowth consisting of almost entirely wild-type tissue (non-autonomous overgrowth), while the Cos2 mutation results in tissue that is overgrown in both the mutant and wild-type clones (both autonomous and non-autonomous). These differences in tissue overgrowth are consistent in the Drosophila eye and wing. The observed difference is correlated with different deregulation patterns of pMad, the downstream effector of DPP signalling. This finding provides insight into pathway-specific differences that help to better understand intricacies of developmental processes and human diseases that result from deregulated Hedgehog signalling, such as basal cell carcinoma.","4":"The Drosophila wing has been used as a model for studying tissue growth, morphogenesis and pattern formation. The wing veins of Drosophila are composed of two distinct structures, longitudinal veins and crossveins. Although positional information of longitudinal veins is largely defined in the wing imaginal disc during the larval stage, crossvein primordial cells appear to be naive until the early pupal stage. Here, we first review how wing crossveins have been investigated in the past. Then, the developmental mechanisms underlying crossvein formation are summarized. This review focuses on how a conserved trafficking mechanism of BMP ligands is utilized for crossvein formation, and how various co-factors play roles in sustaining BMP signalling. Recent findings further reveal that crossvein development serves as an excellent model to address how BMP signal and dynamic cellular processes are coupled. This comprehensive review illustrates the uniqueness, scientific value and future perspectives of wing crossvein development as a model.","5":"Downregulation of protein phosphatase Cdc25Twine activity is linked to remodelling of the cell cycle during the Drosophila maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Here, we present a structure-function analysis of Cdc25Twine. We use chimeras to show that the N-terminus regions of Cdc25Twine and Cdc25String control their differential degradation dynamics. Deletion of different regions of Cdc25Twine reveals a putative domain involved in and required for its rapid degradation during the MZT. Notably, a very similar domain is present in Cdc25String and deletion of the DNA replication checkpoint results in similar dynamics of degradation of both Cdc25String and Cdc25Twine. Finally, we show that Cdc25Twine degradation is delayed in embryos lacking the left arm of chromosome III. Thus, we propose a model for the differential regulation of Cdc25 at the Drosophila MZT.","6":"The Drosophila tracheal system consists of a widespread tubular network that provides respiratory functions for the animal. Its development, from ten pairs of placodes in the embryo to the final stereotypical branched structure in the adult, has been extensively studied by many labs as a model system for understanding tubular epithelial morphogenesis. Throughout these studies, a breathless (btl)-GAL4 driver has provided an invaluable tool to either mark tracheal cells during development or to manipulate gene expression in this tissue. A distinct shortcoming of this approach, however, is that btl-GAL4 cannot be used to specifically visualize tracheal cells in the presence of other GAL4 drivers or other UAS constructs, restricting its utility. Here we describe a direct-drive btl-nGFP reporter that can be used as a specific marker of tracheal cells throughout development in combination with any GAL4 driver and\/or UAS construct. This reporter line should facilitate the use of Drosophila as a model system for studies of tracheal development and tubular morphogenesis.","7":"Living in high latitudes and altitudes sets specific requirements on species' ability to forecast seasonal changes and to respond to them in an appropriate way. Adaptation into diverse environmental conditions can also lead to ecological speciation through habitat isolation or by inducing changes in traits that influence assortative mating. In this review, we explain how the unique time-measuring systems of Drosophila virilis group species have enabled the species to occupy high latitudes and how the traits involved in species reproduction and survival exhibit strong linkage with latitudinally varying photoperiodic and climatic conditions. We also describe variation in reproductive barriers between the populations of two species with overlapping distributions and show how local adaptation and the reinforcement of prezygotic barriers have created partial reproductive isolation between conspecific populations. Finally, we consider the role of species-specific chromosomal inversions and the X chromosome in the development of reproductive barriers between diverging lineages.","8":"An organism's behaviour is influenced by its social environment. Experiences such as social isolation or crowding may have profound short or long-term effects on an individual's behaviour. The composition of the social environment also depends on the genetics and previous experiences of the individuals present, leading to additional potential outcomes from each social interaction. In this article, we review selected literature related to the social environment of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, and how Drosophila respond to variation in their social experiences throughout their lifetimes. We focus on the effects of social environment on behavioural phenotypes such as courtship, aggression, and group dynamics, as well as other phenotypes such as development and physiology. The consequences of phenotypic plasticity due to social environment are discussed with respect to the ecology and evolution of Drosophila. We also relate these studies to laboratory research practices involving Drosophila and other animals.","9":"The genus Scaptomyza is one of the two Drosophilidae genera with Hawaiian endemic species. This genus is an excellent model for biogeographic studies since it is distributed throughout the majority of continents, including continental islands, the Hawaiian Islands, and many other remote oceanic islands. This genus currently comprises 273 described species, 148 of which are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. However, most descriptions were published before efforts to standardizing the morphological terminology across the Diptera were made in the 1980's. Since research groups developed their own set of terminologies independently, without considering homologies, multiple terms have been used to refer to the same characters. This is especially true for the male terminalia, which have remarkable modifications within the family Drosophilidae. We reviewed the Scaptomyza literature, in addition to other studies across the Drosophilidae and Diptera, compiled the English synonyms, and provided a visual atlas of each body part, indicating how to recognize the morphological characters. The goal of the present study is to facilitate species identification and propose preferred terms to be adopted for future Scaptomyza descriptions.","10":"Gene expression profiles are typically described at the level of the tissue or, often in Drosophila, at the level of the whole organism. Collapsing the gene expression of entire tissues into single measures averages over potentially important heterogeneity among the cells that make up that tissue. The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing technology (sc-RNAseq) allows transcriptomic evaluation of the individual cells that make up a tissue. However, sc-RNAseq requires a high-quality suspension of viable cells or nuclei, and cell dissociation methods that yield healthy cells and nuclei are still lacking for many important tissues. The insect fat body is a polyfunctional tissue responsible for diverse physiological processes and therefore is an important target for sc-RNAseq. The Drosophila adult fat body consists of fragile cells that are difficult to dissociate while maintaining cell viability. As an alternative, we developed a method to isolate single fat body nuclei for RNA-seq. Our isolation method is largely free of mitochondrial contamination and yields higher capture of transcripts per nucleus compared to other nuclei preparation methods. Our method works well for single-cell nuclei sequencing and can potentially be implemented for bulk RNA-seq.","11":"Animals must sense their surroundings and be able to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant cues. An enticing area of research aims to uncover the mechanisms by which animals respond to chemical signals that constitute critical sensory input. In this review, we describe the principles of a model chemosensory system: the Drosophila larva. While distinct in many ways, larval behaviour is reminiscent of the dogmatic goals of life: to reach a stage of reproductive potential. It takes into account a number of distinct and identifiable parameters to ultimately provoke or modulate appropriate behavioural output. In this light, we describe current knowledge of chemosensory anatomy, genetic components, and the processing logic of chemical cues. We outline recent advancements and summarize the hypothesized neural circuits of sensory systems. Furthermore, we note yet-unanswered questions to create a basis for further investigation of molecular and systemic mechanisms of chemosensation in Drosophila and beyond.","12":"Dendritic morphogenesis requires dynamic microtubules (MTs) to form a coordinated cytoskeletal network during development. Dynamic MTs are characterized by their number, polarity and speed of polymerization. Previous studies described a correlation between anterograde MT growth and terminal branch extension in Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons, suggesting a model that anterograde MT polymerization provides a driving force for dendritic branching. We recently found that the Ste20-like kinase Tao specifically regulates dendritic branching by controlling the number of dynamic MTs in a kinase activity-dependent fashion, without affecting MT polarity or speed. This finding raises the interesting question of how MT dynamics affects dendritic morphogenesis, and if Tao kinase activity is developmentally regulated to coordinate MT dynamics and dendritic morphogenesis. We explored the possible correlation between MT dynamics and dendritic morphogenesis together with the activity changes of Tao kinase in C1da and C4da neurons during larval development. Our data show that spatiotemporal changes in the number of dynamic MTs, but not polarity or polymerization speed, correlate with dendritic branching and Tao kinase activity. Our findings suggest that Tao kinase limits dendritic branching by controlling the abundance of dynamic MTs and we propose a novel model on how regulation of MT dynamics might influence dendritic morphogenesis.","13":"Notch signalling is a well-conserved signalling pathway that regulates cell fate through cell-cell communication. A typical feature of Notch signalling is 'lateral inhibition', whereby two neighbouring cells of equivalent state of differentiation acquire different cell fates. Recently, mathematical and computational approaches have addressed the Notch dynamics in Drosophila neural development. Typical examples of lateral inhibition are observed in the specification of neural stem cells in the embryo and sensory organ precursors in the thorax. In eye disc development, Notch signalling cooperates with other signalling pathways to define the evenly spaced positioning of the photoreceptor cells. The interplay between Notch and epidermal growth factor receptor signalling regulates the timing of neural stem cell differentiation in the optic lobe. In this review, we summarize the theoretical studies that have been conducted to elucidate the Notch dynamics in these systems and discuss the advantages of combining mathematical models with biological experiments.","14":"","15":"To maintain homoeostasis, cells must degrade damaged or misfolded proteins and synthesize functional replacements. Maintaining a balance between these processes, known as protein turnover, is necessary for stress response and cellular adaptation to a changing environment. Damaged mitochondria must also be removed and replaced. Changes in protein and mitochondrial turnover are associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease, making it important to understand how these processes occur and are regulated in cells. To achieve this, reliable assays of turnover must be developed. Several methods exist, including pulse-labelling with radioactive or stable isotopes and strategies making use of fluorescent proteins, each with their own advantages and limitations. Both cell culture and live animals have been used for these studies, in systems ranging from yeast to mammals. In vivo assays are especially useful for connecting turnover to aging and disease. With its short life cycle, suitability for fluorescent imaging, and availability of genetic tools, Drosophila melanogaster is particularly well suited for this kind of analysis.","16":"Binary expression systems are a powerful tool for tissue- and cell-specific research. Many of the currently available Drosophila eye-specific drivers have not been systematically characterized for their expression level and cell-type specificity in the adult eye or during development. Here, we used a luciferase reporter to measure expression levels of different drivers in the adult Drosophila eye, and characterized the cell type-specificity of each driver using a fluorescent reporter in live 10-day-old adult males. We also further characterized the expression pattern of these drivers in various developmental stages. We compared several Gal4 drivers from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) including GMR-Gal4, longGMR-Gal4 and Rh1-Gal4 with newly developed Gal4 and QF2 drivers that are specific to different cell types in the adult eye. In addition, we generated drug-inducible Rh1-GSGal4 lines and compared their induced expression with an available GMR-GSGal4 line. Although both lines had significant induction of gene expression measured by luciferase activity, Rh1-GSGal4 was expressed at levels below the detection of the fluorescent reporter by confocal microscopy, while GMR-GSGal4 showed substantial reporter expression in the absence of drug by microscopy. Overall, our study systematically characterizes and compares a large toolkit of eye- and photoreceptor-specific drivers, while also uncovering some of the limitations of currently available expression systems in the adult eye.","17":"Evolved metabolic thriftiness in humans is a proposed contributor to the obesity epidemic. Insect models have been shown to evolve both 'metabolic thrift' in response to rearing on high-protein diets that promote leanness, and 'obesity resistance' when reared on fattening high-carbohydrate, low-protein foods. Despite the hypothesis that human obesity is caused by evolved metabolic thrift, genetic contributions to this physiological trait remain elusive. Here we conducted a pilot study to determine whether thrift and obesity resistance can arise under laboratory based 'quasi-natural selection' in the genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We found that both these traits can evolve within 16 generations. Contrary to predictions from the 'thrifty genotype\/phenotype' hypothesis, we found that when animals from a metabolic thrift inducing high-protein environment are mismatched to fattening high-carbohydrate foods, they did not become 'obese'. Rather, they accumulate less triglyceride than control animals, not more. We speculate that this may arise through as yet un-quantified parental effects - potentially epigenetic. This study establishes that D. melanogaster could be a useful model for elucidating the role of the trans- and inter-generational effects of diet on the genetics of metabolic traits in higher animals.","18":"","19":"Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a powerful genetic model to study human disease. Approximately 75% of human disease-associated genes have homologs in the fruit fly and regulatory pathways are highly conserved in Drosophila compared to humans. Drosophila is an established model organism for the study of genetics and developmental biology related to human disease and has also made a great contribution to epigenetic research. Many key factors that regulate chromatin condensation through effects on histone post-translational modifications were first discovered in genetic screens in Drosophila. Recently, the importance of chromatin regulators in cancer progression has been uncovered, leading to a rapid expansion in the knowledge on how perturbations of chromatin can result in the pathogenesis of human cancer. In this review, we provide examples of how Drosophila melanogaster has contributed to better understanding the detrimental effects of mutant forms of histones, called 'oncohistones', that are found in different human tumours.","20":"Drosophila pseudoobscura is a classic model system for the study of evolutionary genetics and genomics. Given this long-standing interest, many genome sequences have accumulated for D. pseudoobscura and closely related species D. persimilis, D. miranda, and D. lowei. To facilitate the exploration of genetic variation within species and comparative genomics across species, we present PseudoBase, a database that couples extensive publicly available genomic data with simple visualization and query tools via an intuitive graphical interface, amenable for use in both research and educational settings. All genetic variation (SNPs and indels) within the database is derived from the same workflow, so variants are easily comparable across data sets. Features include an embedded JBrowse interface, ability to pull out alignments of individual genes\/regions, and batch access for gene lists. Here, we introduce PseudoBase, and we demonstrate how this resource facilitates use of extensive genomic data from flies of the Drosophila pseudoobscura subgroup.","21":"Unregulated Ca2+ influx affects intracellular Ca2+ homoeostasis, which may lead to neuronal death. In Drosophila, following the activation of rhodopsin the TRP Ca2+ channel is open to mediate the light-dependent depolarization. A constitutively active TRP channel triggers the degeneration of TrpP365 \/+ photoreceptors. To explore retinal degeneration, we employed a multidisciplinary approach including live imaging using GFP tagged actin and arrestin 2. Importantly, we demonstrate that the major rhodopsin (Rh1) was greatly reduced before the onset of rhabdomere degeneration; a great reduction of Rh1 affects the maintenance of rhabdomere leading to degeneration of photoreceptors. TrpP365 \/+ also led to the up-regulation of CaMKII, which is beneficial as suppression of CaMKII accelerated retinal degeneration. We explored the regulation of TRP by investigating the genetic interaction between TrpP365 \/+ and mutants affecting the turnover of diacylglycerol (DAG). We show a loss of phospholipase C in norpAP24 exhibited a great reduction of the DAG content delayed degeneration of TrpP365 \/+ photoreceptors. In contrast, knockdown or mutations in DAG lipase (InaE) that is accompanied by slightly reduced levels of most DAG but an increased level of DAG 34:1, exacerbated retinal degeneration of TrpP365 \/+. Together, our findings support the notion that DAG plays a role in regulating TRP. Interestingly, DAG lipase is likely required during photoreceptor development as TrpP365 \/+; inaEN125 double mutants contained severely degenerated rhabdomeres.","22":"The use of the Drosophila model for studying the broad beneficial effects of exercise training has grown over the past decade. As work using Drosophila as an exercise model becomes more widespread, the influence of genetic background on performance should be examined in order to better understand its influence on assessments used to quantitatively measure and compare exercise phenotypes. In this article, we review the various methods of exercise training Drosophila, and the performance of different wild-type Drosophila strains on various physiological assessments of exercise response. We conclude by summarizing the performance trends of commonly used strains.","23":"","24":"Sperm quality, an important male fitness trait, is commonly compared between studies. However, few studies consider how genetic and environmental variation affect sperm quality, even in the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster. Here we show that sperm viability, the proportion of live sperm, differed across the genotypes Oregon-R, Dahomey, and Canton-S by more than 15%, and across buffers (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Grace's Medium and Drosophila Ringer solution) by more than 20%. In terms of genotype-buffer pair comparisons, nearly half of the comparisons would produce significant differences in sperm viability (15 in 36), or its temporal decrease in a stress medium (19 in 36). Grace's medium produced the longest-lived sperm in vitro and the smallest differences between genotypes, Drosophila Ringer Solution produced the shortest lifespan and the largest differences. Our results suggest that fly and other sperm researchers would benefit from a standardized protocol of measuring sperm viability.","25":"Genome editing via homology-directed repair (HDR) has made possible precise and deliberate modifications to gene sequences. CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated HDR is the simplest means to carry this out. However, technical challenges remain to improve efficiency and broaden applicability to any genetic background of Drosophila melanogaster as well as to other Drosophila species. To address these issues, we developed a two-stage marker-assisted strategy in which embryos are injected with RNPs and pre-screened using T7EI. Using sgRNA in complex with recombinant Cas9 protein, we assayed each sgRNA for genome-cutting efficiency. We then conducted HDR using sgRNAs that efficiently cut target genes and the application of a transformation marker that generates RNAi against eyes absent. This allows for screening based on eye morphology rather than colour. These new tools can be used to make a single change or a series of allelic substitutions in a region of interest, or to create additional genetic tools such as balancer chromosomes.","26":null,"27":"Glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) enzymes catalyse the first committed step of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) using glutamine and fructose-6-phosphate to form glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P). Numerous species (e.g. mouse, rat, zebrafish, chicken) including humans and Drosophila encode two broadly expressed copies of this enzyme but whether these perform redundant, partially overlapping or distinct functions is not known. To address this question, we produced single gene null mutations in the fly counterparts of gfat1 and gfat2. Deletions for either enzyme were fully lethal and homozygotes lacking either GFAT1 or GFAT2 died at or prior to the first instar larval stage. Therefore, when genetically eliminated, neither isoform was able to compensate for the other. Importantly, dietary supplementation with D-glucosamine-6-phosphate rescued GFAT2 deficiency and restored viability to gfat2-\/- mutants. In contrast, glucosamine-6-phosphate did not rescue gfat1-\/- animals.","28":"The larvae of Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism widely used to study the muscular and nervous systems. Drosophila larvae are surrounded by a waxy cuticle that prevents permeation by most substances. Here we develop a method to remove this layer, rendering the larvae permeable to small molecules without causing death, allowing the larvae to develop to adulthood and reproduce. Permeability was assessed using fluorescein diacetate dye uptake, and mortality upon exposure to toxic levels of ethylene glycol (EG) and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Potential uses for this method include drug delivery, toxicity assays, cryopreservation, staining, and fixation.","29":"DNA synthesis during replication or repair is a fundamental cellular process that is catalyzed by a set of evolutionary conserved polymerases. Despite a large body of research, the DNA polymerases of Drosophila melanogaster have not yet been systematically reviewed, leading to inconsistencies in their nomenclature, shortcomings in their functional (Gene Ontology, GO) annotations and an under-appreciation of the extent of their characterization. Here, we describe the complete set of DNA polymerases in D. melanogaster, applying nomenclature already in widespread use in other species, and improving their functional annotation. A total of 19 genes encode the proteins comprising three replicative polymerases (alpha-primase, delta, epsilon), five translesion\/repair polymerases (zeta, eta, iota, Rev1, theta) and the mitochondrial polymerase (gamma). We also provide an overview of the biochemical and genetic characterization of these factors in D. melanogaster. This work, together with the incorporation of the improved nomenclature and GO annotation into key biological databases, including FlyBase and UniProtKB, will greatly facilitate access to information about these important proteins.","30":"Quantitative proteomic analyses in combination with genetics provide powerful tools in developmental cell signalling research. Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most widely used genetic models for studying development and disease. Here we combined quantitative proteomics with genetic selection to determine changes in the proteome upon depletion of Heartless (Htl) Fibroblast-Growth Factor (FGF) receptor signalling in Drosophila embryos at the gastrula stage. We present a robust, single generation SILAC (stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture) protocol for labelling proteins in early embryos. For the selection of homozygously mutant embryos at the pre-gastrula stage, we developed an independent genetic marker. Our analyses detected quantitative changes in the global proteome of htl mutant embryos during gastrulation. We identified distinct classes of downregulated and upregulated proteins, and network analyses indicate functionally related groups of proteins in each class. In addition, we identified changes in the abundance of phosphopeptides. In summary, our quantitative proteomic analysis reveals global changes in metabolic, nucleoplasmic, cytoskeletal and transport proteins in htl mutant embryos.","31":"The Drosophila bang-sensitive mutant tko25t, manifesting a global deficiency in oxidative phosphorylation due to a mitochondrial protein synthesis defect, exhibits a pronounced delay in larval development. We previously identified a number of metabolic abnormalities in tko25t larvae, including elevated pyruvate and lactate, and found the larval gut to be a crucial tissue for the regulation of larval growth in the mutant. Here we established that expression of wild-type tko in any of several other tissues of tko25t also partially alleviates developmental delay. The effects appeared to be additive, whilst knockdown of tko in a variety of specific tissues phenocopied tko25t, producing developmental delay and bang-sensitivity. These findings imply the existence of a systemic signal regulating growth in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. Drugs and RNAi-targeted on pyruvate metabolism interacted with tko25t in ways that implicated pyruvate or one of its metabolic derivatives in playing a central role in generating such a signal. RNA-seq revealed that dietary pyruvate-induced changes in transcript representation were mostly non-coherent with those produced by tko25t or high-sugar, consistent with the idea that growth regulation operates primarily at the translational and\/or metabolic level.","32":null,"33":"Animal terminalia represent some of the most diverse and rapidly evolving structures in the animal kingdom, and for this reason have been a mainstay in the taxonomic description of species. The terminalia of Drosophila melanogaster, with its wide range of experimental tools, have recently become the focus of increased interest in the fields of development, evolution, and behavior. However, studies from different disciplines have often used discrepant terminologies for the same anatomical structures. Consequently, the terminology of genital parts has become a barrier to integrating results from different fields, rendering it difficult to determine what parts are being referenced. We formed a consortium of researchers studying the genitalia of D. melanogaster to help establish a set of naming conventions. Here, we present a detailed visual anatomy of male genital parts, including a list of synonymous terms, and suggest practices to avoid confusion when referring to anatomical parts in future studies. The goal of this effort is to facilitate interdisciplinary communication and help newcomers orient themselves within the exciting field of Drosophila genitalia.","34":"Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins orchestrate development of a multicellular organism by faithfully maintaining cell fate decisions made early in embryogenesis. An important chromatin mark connected to PcG\/TrxG regulation is bivalent domains, the simultaneous presence of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 on a given locus, originally identified in mammalian embryonic stem cells but considered to be absent in invertebrates. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of bivalency in fly embryos. Using a recently described PcG reporter fly line, we observed a strong reporter inducibility in the embryo and its sharp decrease in larval and adult stages. Analysis of the chromatin landscape of the reporter revealed a strong signal for the repressive PcG mark, H3K27me3, in all three developmental stages and, surprisingly, a strong signal for a transcriptionally activating H3K4me3 mark in the embryo. Using re-chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, bivalent domains were also uncovered at endogenous PcG targets like the Hox genes.","35":null,"36":"Drosophila melanogaster has recently been developed as a simple, in vivo, genetic model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Flies treated with the chemotherapy agent cisplatin display both a neurodegenerative phenotype and cell death in rapidly dividing follicles, mimicking the cell specific responses seen in humans. Cisplatin induces climbing deficiencies and loss of fertility in a dose dependent manner. Drosophila sensitivity to cisplatin in both cell types is affected by genetic background. We show that mutation or RNAi-based knockdown of genes known to be associated with CIPN incidence in humans affect sensitivity of flies to CIPN. Drosophila is a promising model with which to study the effect of genetics on sensitivity to CIPN.","37":"During Drosophila phototransduction, the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) Rhodopsin (Rh1) transduces photon absorption into electrical signal via G-protein coupled activation of phospholipase C (PLC). Rh1 levels in the plasma membrane are critical for normal sensitivity to light. In this study, we report that Protein Kinase D (dPKD) regulates Rh1 homeostasis in adult photoreceptors. Although eye development and retinal structure are unaffected in the dPKD hypomorph (dPKDH), it exhibited elevated levels of Rh1. Surprisingly, despite having elevated levels of Rh1, no defect was observed in the electrical response to light in these flies. By contrast the levels of another transmembrane protein of the photoreceptor plasma membrane, Transient receptor potential (TRP) was not altered in dPKDH. Our results indicate that dPKD is dispensable for eye development but is required for maintaining Rh1 levels in adult photoreceptors.","38":"The ability to quantify fecundity is critically important to a wide range of experimental applications, particularly in widely-used model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster. However, the standard method of manually counting eggs is time consuming and limits the feasibility of large-scale experiments. We develop a predictive model to automate the counting of eggs from images of eggs removed from the media surface and washed onto dark filter paper. Our method uses the simple relationship between the white area in an image and the number of eggs present to create a predictive model that performs well even at high egg densities where clumping can complicate the individual identification of eggs. A cross-validation approach demonstrates our method performs well, with a correlation between predicted and manually counted values of 0.88. We show how this method can be applied to a large data set where egg densities vary widely.","39":"Duplicated ribosomal protein (RP) genes in the Drosophila melanogaster eRpL22 family encode structurally-divergent and differentially-expressed rRNA-binding RPs. eRpL22 is expressed ubiquitously and eRpL22-like expression is tissue-restricted with highest levels in the adult male germline. We explored paralogue functional equivalence using the GAL4-UAS system for paralogue knockdown or overexpression and a conditional eRpL22-like knockout in a heat- shock flippase\/FRT line. Ubiquitous eRpL22 knockdown with Actin-GAL4 resulted in embryonic lethality, confirming eRpL22 essentiality. eRpL22-like knockdown (60%) was insufficient to cause lethality; yet, conditional eRpL22-like knockout at one hour following egg deposition caused lethality within each developmental stage. Therefore, each paralogue is essential. Variation in timing of heat-shock-induced eRpL22-like knockout highlighted early embryogenesis as the critical period where eRpL22-like expression (not compensated for by eRpL22) is required for normal development of several organ systems, including testis development and subsequent sperm production. To determine if eRpL22-like can substitute for eRpL22, we used Actin-GAL4 for ubiquitous eRpL22 knockdown and eRpL22-like-FLAG (or FLAG-eRpL22: control) overexpression. Emergence of adults demonstrated that ubiquitous eRpL22-like-FLAG or FLAG-eRpL22 expression eliminates embryonic lethality resulting from eRpL22 depletion. Adults rescued by eRpL22-like-FLAG (but not by FLAG-eRpL22) overexpression had reduced fertility and longevity. We conclude that eRpL22 paralogue roles are not completely interchangeable and include functionally-diverse roles in development and spermatogenesis. Testis-specific paralogue knockdown revealed molecular phenotypes, including increases in eRpL22 protein and mRNA levels following eRpL22-like depletion, implicating a negative crosstalk mechanism regulating eRpL22 expression. Paralogue depletion unmasked mechanisms, yet to be defined that impact paralogue co-expression within germ cells.","40":"In this extra view, we comment on our recent work concerning the mRNA localization of the gene slow as molasses (slam). slam is a gene essential for the polarized invagination of the plasma membrane and separation of basal and lateral cortical domains during cellularization as well as for germ cell migration in later embryogenesis. We have demonstrated an intimate relationship between slam RNA and its encoded protein. Slam RNA co-localizes and forms a complex with its encoded protein. Slam mRNA localization not only is required for reaching full levels of functional Slam protein but also depends on Slam protein. The translation of slam mRNA is subject to tight spatio-temporal regulation leading to a rapid accumulation of Slam protein and zygotic slam RNA at the furrow canal. In this extra view, we first discuss the mechanism controlling localization and translation of slam RNA. In addition, we document in detail the maternal and zygotic expression of slam RNA and protein and provide data for a function in membrane stabilization. Furthermore, we mapped the region of Slam protein mediating cortical localization in cultured cells.","41":"Sexual size dimorphism (SSD), a sex difference in body size, is widespread throughout the animal kingdom, raising the question of how sex influences existing growth regulatory pathways to bring about SSD. In insects, somatic sexual differentiation has long been considered to be controlled strictly cell-autonomously. Here, we discuss our surprising finding that in Drosophila larvae, the sex determination gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) functions in neurons to non-autonomously specify SSD. We found that Sxl is required in specific neuronal subsets to upregulate female body growth, including in the neurosecretory insulin producing cells, even though insulin-like peptides themselves appear not to be involved. SSD regulation by neuronal Sxl is also independent of its known splicing targets, transformer and msl-2, suggesting that it involves a new molecular mechanism. Interestingly, SSD control by neuronal Sxl is selective for larval, not imaginal tissue types, and operates in addition to cell-autonomous effects of Sxl and Tra, which are present in both larval and imaginal tissues. Overall, our findings add to a small but growing number of studies reporting non-autonomous, likely hormonal, control of sex differences in Drosophila, and suggest that the principles of sexual differentiation in insects and mammals may be more similar than previously thought.","42":"Physical exercise can improve gait, balance, tremor, flexibility, grip strength and motor coordination in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Several lines of evidence have also shown the therapeutic potential of dietary management and supplementation in halting the progression of PD. However, there is a lack of research on the combined effects of physical activity and nutrition in the progression of PD. We test the effects exercise and dietary modification in a Drosophila model of PD. In this study, we fed Drosophila parkin mutants high protein and high carbohydrate diets without and with stearic acid (4 treatments in total). In parallel, we subjected mutants to a regimen of exercise using a purpose-built 'Power tower' exercise machine. We then measured climbing ability, aconitase activity, and basal mitochondrial ROS levels. We observed that exercising parkin mutants fed the high protein diet improved their climbing ability and increased aconitase activity. There was an additional improvement in climbing and aconitase activity in exercised parkin mutants fed the high protein diet supplemented with stearic acid. No benefits of exercise were seen in parkin mutants fed the high carbohydrate diet. Combined, these results suggest that dietary management along with physical activty has potential to improve mitochondrial biogenesis and delay the progression of PD in Drosophila parkin mutants.","43":"Decapentaplegic (Dpp), the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate bone morphogenetic protein (BMP2\/4), is crucial for patterning and growth in many developmental contexts. The Dpp pathway is regulated at many different levels to exquisitely control its activity. We show that bantam (ban), a microRNA, modulates Dpp signaling activity. Over expression of ban decreases phosphorylated Mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad) levels and negatively affects Dpp pathway transcriptional target genes, while null mutant clones of ban upregulate the pathway. We provide evidence that dpp upregulates ban in the wing imaginal disc, and attenuation of Dpp signaling results in a reduction of ban expression, showing that they function in a feedback loop. Furthermore, we show that this feedback loop is important for maintaining anterior-posterior compartment boundary stability in the wing disc through regulation of optomotor blind (omb), a known target of the pathway. Our results support a model that ban functions with dpp in a negative feedback loop.","44":"Maladaptive changes in the intestinal flora, typically referred to as bacterial dysbiosis, have been linked to intestinal aging phenotypes, including an increase in intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation, activation of inflammatory pathways, and increased intestinal permeability1,2. However, the causal relationships between these phenotypes are only beginning to be unravelled. We recently characterized the age-related changes that occur to septate junctions (SJ) between adjacent, absorptive enterocytes (EC) in the fly intestine. Changes could be observed in the overall level of SJ proteins, as well as the localization of a subset of SJ proteins. Such age-related changes were particularly noticeable at tricellular junctions (TCJ)3. Acute loss of the Drosophila TCJ protein Gliotactin (Gli) in ECs led to rapid activation of stress signalling in stem cells and an increase in ISC proliferation, even under axenic conditions; a gradual disruption of the intestinal barrier was also observed. The uncoupling of changes in bacteria from alterations in ISC behaviour and loss of barrier integrity has allowed us to begin to explore the interrelationship of these intestinal aging phenotypes in more detail and has shed light on the importance of the proteins that contribute to maintenance of the intestinal barrier.","45":"The growth of epithelial tumors is often governed by cell interactions with the surrounding stroma. Drosophila has been instrumental in identifying the relevant molecular elements mediating these interactions. Of note is the role of the TNF ligand Eiger, released from recruited blood cells, in activating the JNK tumor-promoting pathway in epithelial tumors. JNK drives the transcriptional induction of mitogenic molecules, matrix metalloproteases and systemic signals that lead to tumor growth, tissue invasiveness and malignancy. Here we review our findings on a tumor-intrinsic, Eiger- and stroma-independent mechanism that contributes to the unlimited growth potential of tumors caused either by chromosomal instability or impaired cell polarity. This newly identified mechanism, which was revealed in an experimental condition in which contacts between tumor cells and wild-type epithelial cells were minimized, relies on interactions between functionally distinct tumor cell populations that activate JNK in a cell-autonomous manner. We discuss the impact of cell interaction-based feedback amplification loops on the unlimited growth potential of epithelial tumors. These findings are expected to contribute to the identification of the relevant cell populations and molecular mechanisms to be targeted in drug therapy.","46":"The willistoni species subgroup has been the subject of several studies since the latter half of the past century and is considered a Neotropical model for evolutionary studies, given the many levels of reproductive isolation and different evolutionary stages occurring within them. Here we present for the first time a phylogenetic reconstruction combining morphological characters and molecular data obtained from 8 gene fragments (COI, COII, Cytb, Adh, Ddc, Hb, kl-3 and per). Some relationships were incongruent when comparing morphological and molecular data. Also, morphological data presented some unresolved polytomies, which could reflect the very recent divergence of the subgroup. The total evidence phylogenetic reconstruction presented well-supported relationships and summarized the results of all analyses. The diversification of the willistoni subgroup began about 7.3 Ma with the split of D. insularis while D.paulistorum complex has a much more recent diversification history, which began about 2.1 Ma and apparently has not completed the speciation process, since the average time to sister species separation is one million years, and some entities of the D. paulistorum complex diverge between 0.3 and 1 Ma. Based on the obtained data, we propose the categorization of the former \"semispecies\" of D. paulistorum as a subspecies and describe the subspecies D. paulistorum amazonian, D. paulistorum andeanbrazilian, D. paulistorum centroamerican, D. paulistorum interior, D. paulistorum orinocan and D. paulistorum transitional.","47":"The COP9 signalosome inhibits the activity of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases by removing Nedd8 modifications from their Cullin subunits. Neddylation renders these complexes catalytically active, but deneddylation is also necessary for them to exchange adaptor subunits and avoid auto-ubiquitination. Although deneddylation is thought to be the primary function of the COP9 signalosome, additional activities have been ascribed to some of its subunits. We recently showed that COP9 subunits protect the transcriptional repressor and tumor suppressor Capicua from two distinct modes of degradation. Deneddylation by the COP9 signalosome inactivates a Cullin 1 complex that ubiquitinates Capicua following its phosphorylation by MAP kinase in response to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor signaling. The CSN1b subunit also stabilizes unphosphorylated Capicua to control its basal level, independently of the deneddylase function of the complex. Here we further examine the importance of deneddylation for COP9 functions in vivo. We use an uncleavable form of Nedd8 to show that preventing deneddylation does not reproduce the effects of loss of COP9. In contrast, in the presence of COP9, conjugation to uncleavable Nedd8 renders Cullins unable to promote the degradation of their substrates. Our results suggest that irreversible neddylation prolongs COP9 binding to and inhibition of Cullin-based ubiquitin ligases.","48":"Asymmetric cell division (ACD) is an essential process during development for generating cell diversity. In addition, a more recent connection between ACD, cancer and stem cell biology has opened novel and highly intriguing venues in the field. This connection between compromised ACD and tumorigenesis was first demonstrated using Drosophila neural stem cells (neuroblasts, NBs) more than a decade ago and, over the past years, it has also been established in vertebrate stem cells. Here, focusing on Drosophila larval brain NBs, and in light of results recently obtained in our lab, we revisit this connection emphasizing two main aspects: 1) the differences in tumor suppressor activity of different ACD regulators and 2) the potential relevance of environment and temporal window frame for compromised ACD-dependent induction of tumor-like overgrowth.","49":"Epithelial cells are defined by apical-basal and planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, the latter of which establishes an orthogonal plane of polarity in the epithelial sheet. PCP signaling is required for normal cell migration, differentiation, stem cell generation and tissue repair, and defects in PCP have been associated with developmental abnormalities, neuropathologies and cancers. While the molecular mechanism of PCP is incompletely understood, the deepest insights have come from Drosophila, where PCP is manifest in hairs and bristles across the adult cuticle and organization of the ommatidia in the eye. Fly wing cells are marked by actin-rich trichome structures produced at the distal edge of each cell in the developing wing epithelium and in a mature wing the trichomes orient collectively in the distal direction. Genetic screens have identified key PCP signaling pathway components that disrupt trichome orientation, which has been measured manually in a tedious and error prone process. Here we describe a set of image processing and pattern-recognition macros that can quantify trichome arrangements in micrographs and mark these directly by color, arrow or colored arrow to indicate trichome location, length and orientation. Nearest neighbor calculations are made to exploit local differences in orientation to better and more reliably detect and highlight local defects in trichome polarity. We demonstrate the use of these tools on trichomes in adult wing preps and on actin-rich developing trichomes in pupal wing epithelia stained with phalloidin. FijiWingsPolarity is freely available and will be of interest to a broad community of fly geneticists studying the effect of gene function on PCP.","50":"Small, isolated populations are constantly threatened by loss of genetic diversity due to drift. Such situations are found, for instance, in laboratory culturing. In guarding against diversity loss, monitoring of potential changes in population structure is paramount; this monitoring is most often achieved using microsatellite markers, which can be costly in terms of time and money when many loci are scored in large numbers of individuals. Here, we present a case study reducing the number of microsatellites to the minimum necessary to correctly detect the population structure of two Drosophila nigrosparsa populations. The number of loci was gradually reduced from 11 to 1, using the Allelic Richness (AR) and Private Allelic Richness (PAR) as criteria for locus removal. The effect of each reduction step was evaluated by the number of genetic clusters detectable from the data and by the allocation of individuals to the clusters; in the latter, excluding ambiguous individuals was tested to reduce the rate of incorrect assignments. We demonstrate that more than 95% of the individuals can still be correctly assigned when using eight loci and that the major population structure is still visible when using two highly polymorphic loci. The differences between sorting the loci by AR and PAR were negligible. The method presented here will most efficiently reduce genotyping costs when small sets of loci (\"core sets\") for long-time use in large-scale population screenings are compiled.","51":"Master regulatory transcription factors cooperate in networks to shepherd cells through organogenesis. In the Drosophila eye, a collection of master control proteins known as the retinal determination gene network (RDGN) switches the direction and targets of its output to choreograph developmental transitions, but the molecular partners that enable such regulatory flexibility are not known. We recently showed that two RDGN members, Eyes absent (Eya) and Sine oculis (So), promote exit from the terminal cell cycle known as the second mitotic wave (SMW) to permit differentiation. A search for co-factors identified the ubiquitously expressed Combgap (Cg) as a novel transcriptional partner that impedes cell cycle exit and interferes with Eya-So activity specifically in this context. Here, we argue that Cg acts as a flexible transcriptional platform that contributes to numerous gene expression outcomes by a variety of mechanisms. For example, Cg provides repressive activities that dampen Eya-So output, but not by recruiting Polycomb chromatin-remodeling complexes as it does in other contexts. We propose that master regulators depend on both specifically expressed co-factors that assemble the combinatorial code and broadly expressed partners like Cg that recruit the diverse molecular activities needed to appropriately regulate their target enhancers.","52":"The bang-sensitive (BS) mutants of Drosophila are an important model for studying epilepsy. We recently identified a novel BS locus, julius seizure (jus), encoding a protein containing two transmembrane domains and an extracellular cysteine-rich loop. We also determined that jussda iso7.8, a previously identified BS mutation, is an allele of jus by recombination, deficiency mapping, complementation testing, and genetic rescue. RNAi knockdown revealed that jus expression is important in cholinergic neurons and that the critical stage of jus expression is the mid-pupa. Finally, we found that a functional, GFP-tagged genomic construct of jus is expressed mostly in axons of the neck connectives and of the thoracic abdominal ganglia. In this Extra View article, we show that a MiMiC GFP-tagged Jus is localized to the same nervous system regions as the GFP-tagged genomic construct, but its expression is mostly confined to cell bodies and it causes bang-sensitivity. The MiMiC GFP-tag lies in the extracellular loop while the genomic construct is tagged at the C-terminus. This suggests that the alternate position of the GFP tag may disrupt Jus protein function by altering its subcellular localization and\/or stability. We also show that a small subset of jus-expressing neurons are responsible for the BS phenotype. Finally, extending the utility of the BS seizure model, we show that jus mutants exhibit cold-sensitive paralysis and are partially sensitive to strobe-induced seizures.","53":null,"54":null,"55":"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is one of two Ca2+ channels that gates Ca2+ release from ER-stores. The ligand IP3, generated upon specific G-protein coupled receptor activation, binds to IP3R to release Ca2+ into the cytosol. IP3R also mediates ER-store Ca2+ release into the mitochondria, under basal as well as stimulatory conditions; an activity that influences cellular bioenergetics and thus, cellular growth and proliferation. In Drosophila neuroendocrine cells expressing a hypomorphic mutant of IP3R, we observed reduced protein translation levels. Here, we discuss the possible molecular mechanism for this observation. We hypothesise that the cellular energy sensor, AMPK connects IP3R mediated Ca2+ release into the mitochondria, to protein translation, via the TOR pathway.","56":"Many adult organs including Drosophila adult midguts rely on resident stem cells to replenish damaged cells during tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Previous studies have shown that, upon injury, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the midguts can increase proliferation and lineage differentiation to meet the demand for tissue repair. Our recent study has demonstrated that, in response to certain injury, midguts can expand ISC population size as an additional regenerative mechanism. We found that injury elicited by bleomycin feeding or bacterial infection increased the production of two BMP ligands (Dpp and Gbb) in enterocytes (ECs), leading to elevated BMP signaling in progenitor cells that drove an expansion of ISCs by promoting their symmetric self-renewing division. Interestingly, we also found that BMP signaling in ECs inhibits the production of Dpp and Gbb, and that this negative feedback mechanism is required to reset ISC pool size to the homeostatic state. Our findings suggest that BMP signaling exerts two opposing influences on stem cell activity depending on where it acts: BMP signaling in progenitor cells promotes ISC self-renewal while BMP signaling in ECs restricts ISC self-renewal by preventing excessive production of BMP ligands. Our results further suggest that transient expansion of ISC population in conjunction with increasing ISC proliferation provides a more effective strategy for tissue regeneration.","57":"The ease of generating genetically modified animals and cell lines has been markedly increased by the recent development of the versatile CRISPR\/Cas9 tool. However, while the isolation of isogenic cell populations is usually straightforward for mammalian cell lines, the generation of clonal Drosophila cell lines has remained a longstanding challenge, hampered by the difficulty of getting Drosophila cells to grow at low densities. Here, we describe a highly efficient workflow to generate clonal Cas9-engineered Drosophila cell lines using a combination of cell pools, limiting dilution in conditioned medium and PCR with allele-specific primers, enabling the efficient selection of a clonal cell line with a suitable mutation profile. We validate the protocol by documenting the isolation, selection and verification of eight independently Cas9-edited armadillo mutant Drosophila cell lines. Our method provides a powerful and simple workflow that improves the utility of Drosophila cells for genetic studies with CRISPR\/Cas9.","58":null,"59":"Carbon dioxide is an important environmental cue for many insects, regulating many behaviors including some that have direct human impacts. To further improve our understanding of how this system varies among closely related insect species, we examined both the behavioral response to CO2 as well as the transcriptional profile of key developmental regulators of CO2 sensory neurons in the olfactory system across the Drosophila genus. We found that CO2 generally evokes repulsive behavior across most of the Drosophilids we examined, but this behavior has been lost or reduced in several lineages. Comparisons of transcriptional profiles from the developing and adult antennae for subset these species suggest that behavioral differences in some species may be due to differences in the expression of the CO2 co-receptor Gr63a. Furthermore, these differences in Gr63a expression are correlated with changes in the expression of a few genes known to be involved in the development of the CO2 circuit, namely dac, an important regulator of sensilla fate for sensilla that house CO2 ORNs, and mip120, a member of the MMB\/dREAM epigenetic regulatory complex that regulates CO2 receptor expression. In contrast, most of the other known structural, molecular, and developmental components of the peripheral Drosophila CO2 olfactory system seem to be well-conserved across all examined lineages. These findings suggest that certain components of CO2 sensory ORN development may be more evolutionarily labile, and may contribute to differences in CO2-evoked behavioral responses across species.","60":"One of the key factors that determine the interaction between hosts and their parasites is the frequency of their interactions, which depends on the locomotory behavior of both parts. To address host behavior we used natural infections involving insect pathogenic nematodes and Drosophila melanogaster larvae as hosts. Using a modified version of a recently described method (FIMTrack) to assess several parameters in larger sets of animals, we initially detected specific differences in larval food searching when comparing Drosophila strains. These differences were further influenced by the presence of nematodes. Given a choice, Drosophila larvae clearly avoided nematodes irrespective of their genetic background. Our newly developed methods will be useful to test candidate genes and pathways involved in host\/pathogen interactions in general and to assess specific parameters of their interaction.","61":"The exoskeleton of insects and other arthropods is a very versatile material that is characterized by a complex multilayer structure. In Sobala and Adler (2016) we analyzed the process of wing cuticle deposition by RNAseq and electron microscopy. In this extra view we discuss the unique aspects of the envelope the first and most outermost layer and the gene expression program seen at the end of cuticle deposition. We discussed the role of undulae in the deposition of cuticle and how the hydrophobicity of wing cuticle arises.","62":"The germline stem cells (GSCs) are critical for gametogenesis throughout the adult life. Stem cell identity is maintained by local signals from a specialized microenvironment called the niche. However, it is unclear how systemic signals regulate stem cell activity in response to environmental cues. In our previous article, we reported that mating stimulates GSC proliferation in female Drosophila. The mating-induced GSC proliferation is mediated by ovarian ecdysteroids, whose biosynthesis is positively controlled by Sex peptide signaling. Here, we characterized the post-eclosion and post-mating expression pattern of the genes encoding the ecdysteroidogenic enzymes in the ovary. We further investigated the biosynthetic functions of the ovarian ecdysteroid in GSC maintenance in the mated females. We also briefly discuss the regulation of the ecdysteroidogenic enzyme-encoding genes and the subsequent ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the ovary of the adult Drosophila.","63":"As environments and pathogen landscapes shift, host defenses must evolve to remain effective. Due to this selection pressure, among-species comparisons of genetic sequence data often find immune genes to be among the fastest evolving genes across the genome. The full extent and nature of these immune adaptations, however, remain largely unexplored. In a recent study, we analyzed patterns of selection within distinct components of the Drosophila melanogaster immune pathway. While we found evidence of positive selection within some immune processes, immune genes were not universally characterized by signatures of strong selection. On the contrary, we even found that some immune functions show greater than expected constraint. Overall these results highlight 2 major factors that appear to play an outsize role in determining a gene's evolutionary rate: the type of pathogen the gene targets and the gene's position within the immune network. These results join a growing body of literature that highlight the complexity of immune adaptation. Rather than there being uniformly strong selection across all immune genes, a combination of pathogen-specificity and host genetic constraints appear to play key roles in determining each immune gene's individual evolutionary trajectory.","64":"The Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size and tissue homeostasis. Given this role it is unsurprising that dysregulation of this pathway has implications for cancer progression. A convincing body of literature shows that the Hippo pathway serves a tumor suppressive function with its inactivation leading to massive overgrowth. However, additional studies have also shown that activation of Hippo signaling can promote tumor progression. It remains unknown how a single pathway can produce such diametrically opposed effects. This lack of knowledge is in part due to our inability to make meaningful comparisons from studies which have taken place in a variety of cell types, tissues, and organisms. Recently however, we have published 2 studies using the Drosophila wing disk to study the Hippo pathway and have found that Hippo pathway activation can promote cell migration and invasion while Hippo pathway inactivation leads to overgrowth. Thus we propose here that Drosophila can provide a research platform with which to begin addressing how the Hippo pathway can both enhance and suppress tumor progression due to published pro- and anti-tumor functionalities of the Hippo pathway in the same tissue.","65":"The Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) lies at the heart of one of the small set of ubiquitous, conserved signal transduction pathways that do much of the work of development and physiology. Abl signaling is essential to epithelial integrity, motility of autonomous cells such as blood cells, and axon growth and guidance in the nervous system. However, though Abl was one of the first of these conserved signaling machines to be identified, it has been among the last to have its essential architecture elucidated. Here we will first discuss some of the challenges that long delayed the dissection of this pathway, and what they tell us about the special problems of investigating dynamic processes like motility. We will then describe our recent experiments that revealed the functional organization of the Abl pathway in Drosophila neurons. Finally, in the second part of the review we will introduce a different kind of complexity in the role of Abl in motility: the discovery of a previously unappreciated function in protein secretion and trafficking. We will provide evidence that the secretory function of Abl also contributes to its role in axon growth and guidance, and finally end with a discussion of the challenges that Abl pleiotropy provide for the investigator, but the opportunities that it provides for coordinating biological regulation.","66":null,"67":"Drosophila melanogaster chromosome 4 is an anomaly because of its small size, chromatin structure, and most notably its lack of crossing over during meiosis. Earlier ideas about the absence of crossovers on 4 hypothesize that these unique characteristics function to prevent crossovers. Here, we explore hypotheses about the absence of crossovers on 4, how these have been addressed, and new insights into the mechanism behind this suppression. We review recently published results that indicate that global crossover patterning, in particular the centromere effect, make a major contribution to the prevention of crossovers on 4.","68":"In Drosophila melanogaster the progenitors of the germ-line stem cells, the primordial germ cells (PGCs) are formed on the outside surface of the early embryo, while the somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs) are specified during mid-embryogenesis. To form the primitive embryonic gonad, the PGCs travel from outside of the embryo, across the mid-gut and then migrate through the mesoderm to the SGPs. The migratory path of PGCs is dictated by a series of attractive and repulsive cues. Studies in our laboratory have shown that one of the key chemoattractants is the Hedgehog (Hh) ligand. Although, Hh is expressed in other cell types, the long-distance transmission of this ligand is specifically potentiated in the SGPs by the hmgcr isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. The distant transmission of the Hh ligand is gated by restricting expression of hmgcr to the SGPs. This is particularly relevant in light of the recent findings that an ABC transporter, mdr49 also acts in a mesoderm specific manner to release the germ cell attractant. Our studies have demonstrated that mdr49 functions in hh signaling likely via its role in the transport of cholesterol. Given the importance of cholesterol in the processing and long distance transmission of the Hh ligand, this observation has opened up an exciting avenue concerning the possible role of components of the sterol transport machinery in PGC migration.","69":"Diet profoundly influences the behavior of animals across many phyla. Despite this, most laboratories using model organisms, such as Drosophila, use multiple, different, commercial or custom-made media for rearing their animals. In addition to measuring growth, fecundity and longevity, we used several behavioral and physiological assays to determine if and how altering food media influence wild-type (Canton S) Drosophila melanogaster, at larval, pupal, and adult stages. Comparing 2 commonly used commercial food media we observed several key developmental and morphological differences. Third-instar larvae and pupae developmental timing, body weight and size, and even lifespan significantly differed between the 2 diets, and some of these differences persisted into adulthood. Diet was also found to produce significantly different thermal preference, locomotory capacity for geotaxis, feeding rates, and lower muscle response to hormonal stimulation. There were no differences, however, in adult thermal preferences, in the number or viability of eggs laid, or in olfactory learning and memory between the diets. We characterized the composition of the 2 diets and found particularly significant differences in cholesterol and (phospho)lipids between them. Notably, diacylglycerol (DAG) concentrations vary substantially between the 2 diets, and may contribute to key phenotypic differences, including lifespan. Overall, the data confirm that 2 different diets can profoundly influence the behavior, physiology, morphology and development of wild-type Drosophila, with greater behavioral and physiologic differences occurring during the larval stages.","70":"Understanding the computations that take place in neural circuits requires identifying how neurons in those circuits are connected to one another. In addition, recent research indicates that aberrant neuronal wiring may be the cause of several neurodevelopmental disorders, further emphasizing the importance of identifying the wiring diagrams of brain circuits. To address this issue, several new approaches have been recently developed. In this review, we describe several methods that are currently available to investigate the structure and connectivity of the brain, and discuss their strengths and limitations.","71":"","72":"The specification of the R7 photoreceptor in the Drosophila eye has become a classic model for understanding how cell fates are assigned in developing systems. R7 is derived from a group of cells that also gives rise to the R1\/6 photoreceptor class and the non-photoreceptor cone cells. Our studies examine the signals and cellular information that direct each of these cell types. The cell fates are directed by the combined actions of the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) and Notch (N) signaling pathways. The RTK pathway acts to remove the transcription factor Tramtrack (Ttk) which represses the photoreceptor fate. If a cell receives an RTK signal sufficient to remove Ttk then the photoreceptor fate is specified; if not, the cone cell fate results. If Ttk is removed from a cell and its N activity is high then it is specified as an R7, but if its N activity is low then it becomes an R1\/6 class photoreceptor. Thus, a remarkably simple molecular code underlies the specification of the fates: 1. Ttk degraded or not: 2. N activity high or low. In the R1\/6 and cone cell precursors the molecular codes are achieved with relative simplicity but in the R7 precursor, manifold interactions occur between the RTK and N pathways, and to-date we have identified 4 distinct roles played by N in R7 fate specification. In this review we detail this molecular complexity, and describe how the RTK\/N pathway crosstalk eventually leads to the simple molecular code of Tramtrack removed and N activity high. Furthermore, we describe the role played by the transcription factor Lozenge (Lz) in directing retinal precursor fates, and how the RTK\/N signals specify different retinal cell types depending on the presence or absence of Lz.","73":null,"74":"Synthesis of sugars from simple carbon sources is critical for survival of animals under limited nutrient availability. Thus, sugar-synthesizing enzymes should be present across the entire metazoan spectrum. Here, we explore the evolution of glucose and trehalose synthesis using a phylogenetic analysis of enzymes specific for the two pathways. Our analysis reveals that the production of trehalose is the more ancestral biochemical process, found in single cell organisms and primitive metazoans, but also in insects. The gluconeogenic-specific enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) first appears in Cnidaria, but is also present in Echinodermata, Mollusca and Vertebrata. Intriguingly, some species of nematodes and arthropods possess the genes for both pathways. Moreover, expression data from Drosophila suggests that G6Pase and, hence, gluconeogenesis, initially had a neuronal function. We speculate that in insects-and possibly in some vertebrates-gluconeogenesis may be used as a means of neuronal signaling.","75":"The 2nd Mexican Drosophila Research Conference (MexFly) took place on June 30th and July 1st, 2016 in Mexico City, at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (Cinvestav). Principal investigators, postdocs, students, and technicians from Drosophila labs across Mexico attended. The guest speaker was Chris Rushlow from New York University, who presented work on Zelda, a key transcriptional activator of the early zygotic genome. Here we provide a brief report of the meeting, which sketches the present landscape of Drosophila research in Mexico. We also provide a brief historical note on one of the pioneers of the field in this country, Victor Salceda, personally trained by Theodosius Dobzhansky. Salceda presented at the meeting an update of his collaborative project with Dobzhansky on the distribution of Drosophila pseudoobscura chromosomal inversions, initiated over forty years ago.","76":null,"77":"The fruitless (fru) gene in Drosophila has been proposed to play a master regulator role in the formation of neural circuitries for male courtship behavior, which is typically considered to be an innate behavior composed of a fixed action pattern as generated by the central pattern generator. However, recent studies have shed light on experience-dependent changes and sensory-input-guided plasticity in courtship behavior. For example, enhanced male-male courtship, a fru mutant \"hallmark,\" disappears when fru-mutant males are raised in isolation. The fact that neural fru expression is induced by neural activities in the adult invites the supposition that Fru as a chromatin regulator mediates experience-dependent epigenetic modification, which underlies the neural and behavioral plasticity.","78":"In competition for food, territory and mates, male fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) engage in agonistic encounters with conspecifics. The fighting strategies used to obtain these resources are influenced by previous and present experience, environmental cues, and the internal state of the animal including hormonal and genetic influences. Animals that experience prior defeats show submissive behavior and are more likely to lose 2nd contests, while animals that win 1st fights are more aggressive and have a higher probability of winning 2nd contests. In a recent report, we examined these loser and winner effects in greater detail and demonstrated that both winners and losers show short-term memory of the results of previous bouts while only losers demonstrate a longer-term memory that requires protein synthesis. The recent findings also suggested that an individual recognition mechanism likely exists that can serve important roles in evaluating the fighting ability of opponents and influencing future fighting strategy. In this article, we follow up on these results by asking how previous defeated and victorious flies change their fighting strategies in the presence of 2nd losing and winning flies, by searching for evidence of territory marking, and discussing the existing literature in light of our findings.","79":"Somatic recombination is essential to protect genomes of somatic cells from DNA damage but it also has important clinical implications, as it is a driving force of tumorigenesis leading to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Despite this importance, our knowledge about somatic recombination in adult tissues remains very limited. Our recent work, using the Drosophila adult midgut has demonstrated that spontaneous events of mitotic recombination accumulate in aging adult intestinal stem cells and result in frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In this Extra View article, we provide further data supporting long-track chromosome LOH and discuss potential mechanisms involved in the process. In addition, we further discuss relevant questions surrounding somatic recombination and how the mechanisms and factors influencing somatic recombination in adult tissues can be explored using the Drosophila midgut model.","80":"Development of the insect compound eye requires a highly controlled interplay between transcription factors. However, the genetic mechanisms that link early eye field specification to photoreceptor terminal differentiation and fate maintenance remain largely unknown. Here, we decipher the function of 2 transcription factors, Glass and Hazy, which play a central role during photoreceptor development. The regulatory interactions between Glass and Hazy suggest that they function together in a coherent feed-forward loop in all types of Drosophila photoreceptors. While the glass mutant eye lacks the expression of virtually all photoreceptor genes, young hazy mutants correctly express most phototransduction genes. Interestingly, the expression of these genes is drastically reduced in old hazy mutants. This age-dependent loss of the phototransduction cascade correlates with a loss of phototaxis in old hazy mutant flies. We conclude that Glass can either directly or indirectly initiate the expression of most phototransduction proteins in a Hazy-independent manner, and that Hazy is mainly required for the maintenance of functional photoreceptors in adult flies.","81":null,"82":"Apoptosis-induced proliferation (AiP) maintains tissue homeostasis following massive stress-induced cell death. During this phenomenon, dying cells induce proliferation of the surviving cells to compensate for the tissue loss, and thus restore organ size. Along with wound healing and tissue regeneration, AiP also contributes to tumor repopulation following radiation or chemotherapy. There are several models of AiP. Using an \"undead\" AiP model that causes hyperplastic overgrowth of Drosophila epithelial tissue, we recently demonstrated that extracellular reactive oxygen species (eROS) are produced by undead epithelial cells, and are necessary for inducing AiP and overgrowth. Furthermore, hemocytes, the Drosophila blood cells, are seen adjacent to the undead epithelial tissue, and may secrete the TNF ortholog Eiger that signals through the TNF receptor to active Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the undead tissue and induce proliferation. We propose that undead epithelial tissue triggers an inflammatory response that resembles recruitment of macrophages to human epithelial tumors, and that these tumor-associated macrophages release signals for proliferation and tumor growth of the epithelium. This Extra View article summarizes these recent findings with a focus on the role of eROS for promoting regeneration and inflammation-induced tumorigenesis.","83":"Living organisms experience tissue damage from both, the surrounding environment and from inside their bodies. Tissue repair\/regeneration is triggered by local tissue injury to restore an injured, or lost, part of the body. Tissue damage results in a series of responses, not only locally but also systemically in distant tissues. In our recent publication, we established a \"dual system\" that induces spatiotemporal tissue damage simultaneously with gene manipulation in surrounding tissues. With this system, we demonstrated that appropriate regulation of methionine metabolism in the fat body is required for tissue repair in Drosophila wing discs, thus highlighting the importance of systemic damage response (SDR) in tissue repair. This \"Extra View\" aims to discuss our recent reports that propose methionine metabolism to be an essential part of SDR, together with related topics in several model organisms.","84":null,"85":"Trans-inactivation is the repression of genes on a normal chromosome under the influence of a rearranged homologous chromosome demonstrating the position effect variegation (PEV). This phenomenon was studied in detail on the example of brownDominant allele causing the repression of wild-type brown gene on the opposite chromosome. We have investigated another trans-inactivation-inducing chromosome rearrangement, In(2)A4 inversion. In both cases, brownDominant and In(2)A4, the repression seems to be the result of dragging of the euchromatic region of the normal chromosome into the heterochromatic environment. It was found that cis-inactivation (classical PEV) and trans-inactivation show different patterns of distribution along the chromosome and respond differently to PEV modifying genes. It appears that the causative mechanism of trans-inactivation is de novo heterochromatin assembly on euchromatic sequences dragged into the heterochromatic nuclear compartment. Trans-inactivation turns out to be the result of a combination of heterochromatin-induced position effect and the somatic interphase chromosome pairing that is widespread in Diptera.","86":"Only two parasite interactions are known for Drosophila to date: Allantonematid nematodes associated with mycophagous Drosophilids and the ectoparasitic mite Macrocheles subbadius with the Sonoran Desert endemic Drosophila nigrospiracula. Unlike the nematode-Drosophila association, breadth of mite parasitism on Drosophila species is unknown. As M. subbadius is a generalist, parasitism of additional Drosophilids is expected. We determined the extent and distribution of mite parasitism in nature Drosophilids collected in Mexico and southern California. Thirteen additional species of Drosophilids were infested. Interestingly, 10 belong to the repleta species group of the subgenus Drosophila, despite the fact that the majority of flies collected were of the subgenus Sophophora. In all cases but 2, the associated mites were M. subbadius. Drosophila hexastigma was found to have not only M. subbadius, but another Mesostigmatid mite, Paragarmania bakeri, as well. One D. hydei was also found to have a mite from genus Lasioseius attached. In both choice and no-choice experiments, mites were more attracted to repleta group species than to Sophophoran. The extent of mite parasitism clearly is much broader than previously reported and suggests a host bias mediated either by mite preference and\/or some mechanism of resistance in particular Drosophilid lineages.","87":"Synthesis of polypeptides from mRNA (translation) is a fundamental cellular process that is coordinated and catalyzed by a set of canonical 'translation factors'. Surprisingly, the translation factors of Drosophila melanogaster have not yet been systematically identified, leading to inconsistencies in their nomenclature and shortcomings in functional (Gene Ontology, GO) annotations. Here, we describe the complete set of translation factors in D. melanogaster, applying nomenclature already in widespread use in other species, and revising their functional annotation. The collection comprises 43 initiation factors, 12 elongation factors, 3 release factors and 6 recycling factors, totaling 64 of which 55 are cytoplasmic and 9 are mitochondrial. We also provide an overview of notable findings and particular insights derived from Drosophila about these factors. This catalog, together with the incorporation of the improved nomenclature and GO annotation into FlyBase, will greatly facilitate access to information about the functional roles of these important proteins.","88":"Genome editing via the CRISPR\/Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease system has opened up exciting possibilities for genetic analysis. However, technical challenges associated with homology-directed repair have proven to be roadblocks for producing changes in the absence of unwanted, secondary mutations commonly known as \"scars.\" To address these issues, we developed a 2-stage, marker-assisted strategy to facilitate precise, \"scarless\" edits in Drosophila with a minimal requirement for molecular screening. Using this method, we modified 2 base pairs in a gene of interest without altering the final sequence of the CRISPR cut sites. We executed this 2-stage allele swap using a novel transformation marker that drives expression in the pupal wings, which can be screened for in the presence of common eye-expressing reporters. The tools we developed can be used to make a single change or a series of allelic substitutions in a region of interest in any D. melanogaster genetic background as well as in other Drosophila species.","89":"Neurons form precise patterns of connections. The cellular recognition mechanisms regulating the selection of synaptic partners are poorly understood. As final mediators of cell-cell interactions, cell surface and secreted molecules (CSMs) are expected to play important roles in this process. To gain insight into how neurons discriminate synaptic partners, we profiled the transcriptomes of 7 closely related neurons forming distinct synaptic connections in discrete layers in the medulla neuropil of the fly visual system. Our sequencing data revealed that each one of these neurons expresses a unique combination of hundreds of CSMs at the onset of synapse formation. We show that 21 paralogs of the defective proboscis extension response (Dpr) family are expressed in a unique cell-type-specific fashion, consistent with the distinct connectivity pattern of each neuron profiled. Expression analysis of their cognate binding partners, the 9 members of the Dpr interacting protein (DIP) family, revealed complementary layer-specific expression in the medulla, suggestive of interactions between neurons expressing Dpr and those expressing DIP in the same layer. Through coexpression analysis and correlation to connectome data, we identify neurons expressing DIP as a subset of the synaptic partners of the neurons expressing Dpr. We propose that Dpr-DIP interactions regulate patterns of connectivity between the neurons expressing them.","90":"Master genes are known to induce the differentiation of a multipotent cell into a specific cell type. These molecules are often transcription factors that switch on the regulatory cascade that triggers cell specification. Gcm was first described as the master gene of the glial fate in Drosophila as it induces the differentiation of neuroblasts into glia in the developing nervous system. Later on, Gcm was also shown to regulate the differentiation of blood, tendon and peritracheal cells as well as that of neuronal subsets. Thus, the glial master gene is used in at least 4 additional systems to promote differentiation. To understand the numerous roles of Gcm, we recently reported a genome-wide screen of Gcm direct targets in the Drosophila embryo. This screen provided new insight into the role and mode of action of this powerful transcription factor, notably on the interactions between Gcm and major differentiation pathways such as the Hedgehog, Notch and JAK\/STAT. Here, we discuss the mode of action of Gcm in the different systems, we present new tissues that require Gcm and we revise the concept of 'master gene'.","91":"decapentaplegic (dpp), the Drosophila ortholog of BMP 2\/4, directs ventral adult head morphogenesis through expression in the peripodial epithelium of the eye-antennal disc. This dpp expressing domain exerts effects both on the peripodial epithelium, and the underlying disc proper epithelium. We have uncovered a role for the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in dpp-mediated ventral head development. JNK activity is required for dpp's action on the disc proper, but in the absence of dpp expression, excessive JNK activity is produced, leading to specific loss of maxillary palps. In this review we outline our hypotheses on how dpp acts by both short range and longer range mechanisms to direct head morphogenesis and speculate on the dual role of JNK signaling in this process. Finally, we describe the regulatory control of dpp expression in the eye-antennal disc, and pose the problem of how the various expression domains of a secreted protein can be targeted to their specific functions.","92":"During animal development, cells with similar function and fate often stay together and sort out from cells with different fates. In Drosophila wing imaginal discs, cells of anterior and posterior fates are separated by a straight compartment boundary. Separation of anterior and posterior cells requires the homeodomain-containing protein Engrailed, which is expressed in posterior cells. Engrailed induces the expression of the short-range signaling molecule Hedgehog in posterior cells and confines Hedgehog signal transduction to anterior cells. Transduction of the Hedgehog signal in anterior cells is required for the separation of anterior and posterior cells. Previous work showed that this separation of cells involves a local increase in mechanical tension at cell junctions along the compartment boundary. However, how mechanical tension was locally increased along the compartment boundary remained unknown. A recent paper now shows that the difference in Hedgehog signal transduction between anterior and posterior cells is necessary and sufficient to increase mechanical tension. The local increase in mechanical tension biases junctional rearrangements during cell intercalations to maintain the straight shape of the compartment boundary. These data highlight how developmental signals can generate patterns of mechanical tension important for tissue organization.","93":"Infection avoidance behaviors are the first line of defense against pathogenic encounters. Behavioral plasticity in response to internal or external cues of infection can therefore generate potentially significant heterogeneity in infection. We tested whether Drosophila melanogaster exhibits infection avoidance behavior, and whether this behavior is modified by prior exposure to Drosophila C Virus (DCV) and by the risk of DCV encounter. We examined 2 measures of infection avoidance: (1) the motivation to seek out food sources in the presence of an infection risk and (2) the preference to land on a clean food source over a potentially infectious source. While we found no evidence for preference of clean food sources over potentially infectious ones, previously exposed female flies showed lower motivation to pick a food source when presented with a risk of encountering DCV. We discuss the relevance of behavioral plasticity during foraging for host fitness and pathogen spread.","94":"Remarkable progress has been made on the understanding of the basic mechanisms of innate immunity in flies, from sensing infection to production of effector molecules. However, how the immune response is orchestrated at the level of the organism remains poorly understood. While cytokines activating immune responses, such as Spaetzle or Unpaired-3, have been identified and characterized in Drosophila, much less is known regarding immunosuppressor cytokines. In a recent publication, we reported the identification of a novel cytokine, Diedel, which acts as systemic negative regulator of the IMD pathway. Here, we discuss the similarities between Diedel and WntD, another immunomodulatory cytokine and present evidence that the 2 molecules act independently from one another.","95":"From Drosophila to man, multinucleated muscle cells form through cell-cell fusion. Using Drosophila as a model system, researchers first identified, and then demonstrated, the importance of actin cytoskeletal rearrangements at the site of fusion. These actin rearrangements at the fusion site are regulated by SCAR and WASp mediated Arp2\/3 activation, which nucleates branched actin networks. Loss of SCAR, WASp or both leads to defects in myoblast fusion. Recently, we have found that the actin regulator Diaphanous (Dia) also plays a role both in organizing actin and in regulating Arp2\/3 activity at the fusion site. In this Extra View article, we provide additional data showing that the Abi-SCAR complex accumulates at the fusion site and that excessive SCAR activity impairs myoblast fusion. Using constitutively active Dia constructs, we provide additional evidence that Dia functions upstream of SCAR activity to regulate actin dynamics at the fusion site and to localize the Abi-SCAR complex.","96":null,"97":null,"98":"The Drosophila sex-peptide (SP) has been identified as a seminal fluid component that induces post-mating responses (PMRs) in the inseminated females, such as inhibition of remating and stimulation of egg-laying. SP has been thought to play a central role in sexual conflict and sexually antagonistic co-evolution. Most of the sequenced Drosophila genomes contain SP orthologs, but their functions have been poorly characterized. Recently, we have investigated cross-species activity of D. melanogaster SP by means of injection into virgin females of other species. Among 11 species examined, SP response was observed in 6 species belonging to the D. melanogaster species group only. These species females express SP receptor (SPR) in their oviducts at relatively high levels, which was visualized by using a GFP-tagged SP. Furthermore, females of this species group responded to their own SP orthologs. However, females of the species outside the group did not respond to their own SP orthologs, even though all of them were potent inducers of SP-response in D. melanogaster. Our results suggested that the SP\/SPR-mediated PMR was established in the lineage of the D. melanogaster species group.","99":"Uncovering the genetic and molecular basis of barriers to gene flow between populations is key to understanding how new species are born. Intrinsic postzygotic reproductive barriers such as hybrid sterility and hybrid inviability are caused by deleterious genetic interactions known as hybrid incompatibilities. The difficulty in identifying these hybrid incompatibility genes remains a rate-limiting step in our understanding of the molecular basis of speciation. We recently described how whole genome sequencing can be applied to identify hybrid incompatibility genes, even from genetically terminal hybrids. Using this approach, we discovered a new hybrid incompatibility gene, gfzf, between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, and found that it plays an essential role in cell cycle regulation. Here, we discuss the history of the hunt for incompatibility genes between these species, discuss the molecular roles of gfzf in cell cycle regulation, and explore how intragenomic conflict drives the evolution of fundamental cellular mechanisms that lead to the developmental arrest of hybrids.","100":"Measuring thermal behavior in smaller insects is particularly challenging. In this study, we describe a new horizontal thermal gradient apparatus designed to study adult thermal behavior in small insects and apply it using D. melanogaster as a model and case study. Specifically, we used this apparatus and associated methodology to examine the effects of sex, geographic origin, and developmental rearing temperature on temperature preferences exhibited by adults in a controlled laboratory environment. The thermal gradient established by the apparatus was stable over diurnal and calendar time. Furthermore, the distribution of adult flies across thermal habitats within the apparatus remained stable following the period of acclimation, as evidenced by the high degree of repeatability across both biological and technical replicates. Our data demonstrate significant and predictable variation in temperature preference for all 3 assayed variables. Behaviorally, females were more sensitive than males to higher temperatures. Flies originating from high latitude, temperate populations exhibited a greater preference for cooler temperatures; conversely, flies originating from low latitude, tropical habitats demonstrated a relative preference for higher temperatures. Similarly, larval rearing temperature was positively associated with adult thermal behavior: low culture temperatures increased the relative adult preference for cooler temperatures, and this response was distinct between the sexes and for flies from the temperate and subtropical geographic regions. Together, these results demonstrate that the temperature chamber apparatus elicits robust, predictable, and quantifiable thermal preference behavior that could readily be applied to other taxa to examine the role of temperature-mediated behavior in a variety of contexts.","101":"Recent work has strengthened Drosophila imaginal discs as a model system for regeneration studies. Evidence is accumulating that oxidative stress drives the cellular responses for repair and regeneration. Drosophila imaginal discs generate a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon damage that is necessary for the activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways. Moreover, these pathways are pivotal in the activation of regenerative growth. A hypothetical mechanism of how the ROS are initiated, and how repair and regeneration is activated is discussed here.","102":"In a recent study, we investigated the regulation of hunchback (hb) transcription dynamics in Drosophila embryos. Our results suggest that shutdown of hb transcription at early nuclear cycle (nc) 14 is an event associated with the global changes taking place during the mid-blastula transition (MBT). Here we have developed a simple model of hb transcription dynamics during this transition time. With kinetic parameters estimated from our published experimental data, the model describes the dynamical processes of hb gene transcription and hb mRNA accumulation. With two steps, transcription onset upon exiting the previous mitosis followed by a sudden impact that blocks gene activation, the model recapitulates the observed dynamics of hb transcription during the nc14 interphase. The timing of gene inactivation is essential, as its alterations lead to changes in both hb transcription dynamics and hb mRNA levels. Our model provides a clear dynamical picture of hb transcription regulation as one of the many, actively regulated events concurrently taking place during the MBT.","103":"Selective membrane transport pathways are essential for cells in situ to construct and maintain a polarized structure comprising multiple plasma membrane domains, which is essential for their specific cellular functions. Genetic screening in Drosophila photoreceptors harboring multiple plasma membrane domains enables the identification of genes involved in polarized transport pathways. Our genome-wide high-throughput screening identified a Rab6-null mutant with a rare phenotype characterized by a loss of 2 apical transport pathways with an intact basolateral transport. Although the functions of Rab6 in the Golgi apparatus are well known, its function in polarized transport is unexpected. The mutant phenotype and localization of Rab6 strongly indicate that Rab6 regulates transport between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling endosomes (REs): basolateral cargos are segregated at the TGN before Rab6 functions, but cargos going to multiple apical domains are sorted at REs. Both the medial-Golgi resident protein Metallophosphoesterase (MPPE) and the TGN marker GalT::CFP exhibit diffused co-localized distributions in Rab6-deficient cells, suggesting they are trapped in the retrograde transport vesicles returning to trans-Golgi cisternae. Hence, we propose that Rab6 regulates the fusion of retrograde transport vesicles containing medial, trans-Golgi resident proteins to the Golgi cisternae, which causes Golgi maturation to REs.","104":"Living organisms respond to nutrient availability by regulating the activity of metabolic enzymes. Therefore, the reversible post-translational modification of an enzyme is a common regulatory mechanism for energy conservation. Recently, cytidine-5'-triphosphate (CTP) synthase was discovered to form a filamentous structure that is evolutionarily conserved from flies to humans. Interestingly, induction of the formation of CTP synthase filament is responsive to starvation or glutamine depletion. However, the biological roles of this structure remain elusive. We have recently shown that ubiquitination regulates CTP synthase activity by promoting filament formation in Drosophila ovaries during endocycles. Intriguingly, although the ubiquitination process was required for filament formation induced by glutamine depletion, CTP synthase ubiquitination was found to be inversely correlated with filament formation in Drosophila and human cell lines. In this article, we discuss the putative dual roles of ubiquitination, as well as its physiological implications, in the regulation of CTP synthase structure.","105":"Several signaling pathways, including the JAK\/STAT and Toll pathways, are known to activate blood cells (hemocytes) in Drosophila melanogaster larvae. They are believed to regulate the immune response against infections by parasitoid wasps, such as Leptopilina boulardi, but how these pathways control the hemocytes is not well understood. Here, we discuss the recent discovery that both muscles and fat body take an active part in this response. Parasitoid wasp infection induces Upd2 and Upd3 secretion from hemocytes, leading to JAK\/STAT activation mainly in hemocytes and in skeletal muscles. JAK\/STAT activation in muscles, but not in hemocytes, is required for an efficient encapsulation of wasp eggs. This suggests that Upd2 and Upd3 are important cytokines, coordinating different tissues for the cellular immune response in Drosophila. In the fat body, Toll signaling initiates a systemic response in which hemocytes are mobilized and activated hemocytes (lamellocytes) are generated. However, the contribution of Toll signaling to the defense against wasps is limited, probably because the wasps inject inhibitors that prevent the activation of the Toll pathway. In conclusion, parasite infection induces a systemic response in Drosophila larvae involving major organ systems and probably the physiology of the entire organism.","106":"In Drosophila melanogaster a functional pericentriolar matrix (PCM) at mitotic centrosomes requires Centrosomin-Long Form (Cnn-LF) proteins. Moreover, tissue culture cells have shown that the centrosomal localization of both Cnn-LF and Polo kinase are co-dependent, suggesting a direct interaction. Our recent study found Cnn potentially binds to and is phosphorylated by Polo kinase at 2 residues encoded by Exon1A, the initiating exon of a subset of Cnn isoforms. These interactions are required for the centrosomal localization of Cnn-LF in syncytial embryos and a mutation of either phosphorylation site is sufficient to block localization of both mutant and wild-type Cnn when they are co-expressed. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that Cnn-LF interacts directly with mitotically activated Polo kinase and requires the 2 phosphorylation sites in Exon1A. These IP experiments also show that Cnn-LF proteins form multimers. Depending on the stoichiometry between functional and mutant peptides, heteromultimers exhibit dominant negative or positive trans-complementation (rescue) effects on mitosis. Additionally, following the completion of meiosis, Cnn-Short Form (Cnn-SF) proteins are required for polar body formation in embryos, a process previously shown to require Polo kinase. These findings, when combined with previous work, clearly demonstrate the complexity of cnn and show that a view of cnn as encoding a single peptide is too simplistic.","107":"The homeostatic turnover of adult organs and their regenerative capacity following injury depend on a careful balance between stem cell self-renewal (to maintain or enlarge the stem cell pool) and differentiation (to replace lost tissue). We have recently characterized the role of the Drosophila Snail family transcription factor escargot (esg) in testis cyst stem cells (CySCs) (1,2) and intestinal stem cells (ISCs). (3,4) CySCs mutant for esg are not maintained as stem cells, but they remain capable of differentiating normally along the cyst cell lineage. In contrast, esg mutant CySCs that give rise to a closely related lineage, the apical hub cells, cannot maintain hub cell identity. Similarly, Esg maintains stemness of ISCs while regulating the terminal differentiation of progenitor cells into absorptive enterocytes or secretory enteroendocrine cells. Therefore, our findings suggest that Esg may play a conserved and pivotal regulatory role in adult stem cells, controlling both their maintenance and terminal differentiation. Here we propose that this dual regulatory role is due to simultaneous control by Esg of overlapping genetic programs and discuss the exciting challenges and opportunities that lie ahead to explore the underlying mechanisms experimentally.","108":"Aubergine is an RNA-binding protein of the Piwi clade, functioning in germline in the piRNA pathway that silences transposons and repetitive sequences. Several mutations of this gene exist, but they mostly result in truncated proteins or correspond to mutations that also affect neighboring genes. We have generated complete aubergine knock-out mutants that do not disrupt the neighboring genes. These novel mutants are characterized by PCR and sequencing. Their nature is confirmed by female sterility and by the presence of crystals in testes, common to the aubergine loss of function mutations. These mutants provide novel and more appropriate tools for the study of the piRNA pathway that controls genome stability.","109":"Kidney stone disease is a major health burden with a complex and poorly understood pathophysiology. Drosophila Malpighian tubules have been shown to resemble human renal tubules in their physiological function. Herein, we have used Drosophila as a model to study the proteomic response to crystal formation induced by dietary manipulation in Malpighian tubules. Wild-type male flies were reared in parallel groups on standard medium supplemented with lithogenic agents: control, Sodium Oxalate (NaOx) and Ethylene Glycol (EG). Malpighian tubules were dissected after 2 weeks to visualize crystals with polarized light microscopy. The parallel group was dissected for protein extraction. A new method of Gel Assisted Sample Preparation (GASP) was used for protein extraction. Differentially abundant proteins (p&lt;0.05) were identified by label-free quantitative proteomic analysis in flies fed with NaOx and EG diet compared with control. Their molecular functions were further screened for transmembrane ion transporter, calcium or zinc ion binder. Among these, 11 candidate proteins were shortlisted in NaOx diet and 16 proteins in EG diet. We concluded that GASP is a proteomic sample preparation method that can be applied to individual Drosophila Malpighian tubules. Our results may further increase the understanding of the pathophysiology of human kidney stone disease.","110":null,"111":"Dissociation of imaginal disc cells has been carried out previously to enable flow cytometry and cell sorting to analyze cell cycle progression, cell size, gene expression, and other aspects of imaginal tissues. However, the lengthy dissociation protocols employed may alter gene expression, cell behavior and overall viability. Here we describe a new rapid and gentle method of dissociating the cells of wing imaginal discs that significantly enhances cell viability and reduces the likelihood of gene expression changes. Furthermore, this method is scalable, enabling collection of large amounts of sample for high-throughput experiments without the need for data-distorting amplifications.","112":"The analysis of consequences resulting after experimental elimination of gene function has been and will continue to be an extremely successful strategy in biological research. Mutational elimination of gene function has been widely used in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. RNA interference is used extensively as well. In the fly, exceptionally precise temporal and spatial control over elimination of gene function can be achieved in combination with sophisticated transgenic approaches and clonal analyses. However, the methods that act at the gene and transcript level cannot eliminate protein products which are already present at the time when mutant cells are generated or RNA interference is started. Targeted inducible protein degradation is therefore of considerable interest for controlled rapid elimination of gene function. To this end, a degradation system was developed in yeast exploiting TIR1, a plant F box protein, which can recruit proteins with an auxin-inducible degron to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, but only in the presence of the phytohormone auxin. Here we demonstrate that the auxin-inducible degradation system functions efficiently also in Drosophila melanogaster. Neither auxin nor TIR1 expression have obvious toxic effects in this organism, and in combination they result in rapid degradation of a target protein fused to the auxin-inducible degron.","113":"Understanding regulation of transposon movement in somatic cells is important as mobile elements can cause detrimental genomic rearrangements. Generally, transposons move via one of 2 mechanisms; retrotransposons utilize an RNA intermediate, therefore copying themselves and amplifying throughout the genome, while terminal inverted repeat transposons (TIR Tns) excise DNA sequences from the genome and integrate into a new location. Our recently published work indicates that retrotransposons in Drosophila tissue culture cells are actively transcribed in the antisense direction. Our data support a model in which convergent transcription of retrotransposons from intra element transcription start sites results in complementary RNAs that hybridize to form substrates for Dicer-2, the endogenous small interfering (esi)RNA generating enzyme. Here, we extend our previous analysis to TIR Tns. In contrast to retrotransposons, our data show that antisense TIR Tn RNAs result from transcription of intronic TIR Tns oriented antisense to their host genes. Also, disproportionately less esiRNAs are generated from TIR transcripts than from retrotransposons and transcription of very few individual TIR Tns could be confirmed. Collectively, these data support a model in which TIR Tns are regulated at the level of Transposase production while retrotransposons are regulated with esiRNA post-transcriptional mechanisms in Drosophila somatic cells.","114":"Size and weight control is a tightly regulated process, involving the highly conserved Insulin receptor\/target of rapamycin (InR\/TOR) signaling cascade. We recently identified Cyclin G (CycG) as an important modulator of InR\/TOR signaling activity in Drosophila. cycG mutant flies are underweight and show a disturbed fat metabolism resembling TOR mutants. In fact, InR\/TOR signaling activity is disturbed in cycG mutants at the level of Akt1, the central kinase linking InR and TORC1. Akt1 is negatively regulated by protein phosphatase PP2A. Notably the binding of the PP2A B'-regulatory subunit Widerborst (Wdb) to Akt1 is differentially regulated in cycG mutants, presumably by a direct interaction of CycG and Wdb. Since the metabolic defects of cycG mutant animals are abrogated by a concomitant loss of Wdb, CycG presumably influences Akt1 activity at the PP2A nexus. Here we show that Well rounded (Wrd), another B' subunit of PP2A in Drosophila, binds CycG similar to Wdb, and that its loss ameliorates some, but not all, of the metabolic defects of cycG mutants. We propose a model, whereby the binding of CycG to a particular B'-regulatory subunit influences the tissue specific activity of PP2A, required for the fine tuning of the InR\/TOR signaling cascade in Drosophila.","115":"The coupling of growth to nutritional status is an important adaptive response of living organisms to their environment. For this ability, animals have evolved various strategies, including endocrine systems that respond to changing nutritional conditions. In animals, nutritional information is mostly perceived by peripheral organs, such as the digestive tract and adipose tissues, and is subsequently transmitted to other peripheral organs or the brain, which integrates the incoming signals and orchestrates physiological and behavioral responses. In Drosophila melanogaster, adipose tissue, known as the fat body, functions as an endocrine organ that communicates with the brain. This fat body-brain axis coordinates growth with nutritional status by regulating the secretion of Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) from the brain. However, the molecular nature of the fat body-brain axis remains to be elucidated. We recently demonstrated that a small peptide, CCHamide-2 (CCHa2), expressed in the fat body and gut, directly stimulates its receptor (CCHa2-R) in the brain, leading to Dilp production. Notably, the expression of CCHa2 is sensitive to the presence of nutrients, particularly sugars. Our results, together with the results of previous studies, show that signaling between peripheral organs and the brain is a conserved strategy that couples nutritional availability to organismal physiology. ","116":"The genus Zaprionus consists of approximately 60 species of drosophilids that are native to the Afrotropical region. The phylogenetic position of Zaprionus within the Drosophilidae family is still unresolved. In the present study, ultrastructural features of spermatozoa of 6 species of Zaprionus as well as the species Drosophila willistoni and Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis were analyzed. The ultrastructure revealed that the species have the same flagellar ultrastructure. Two mitochondrial derivatives, one larger than the other, close to the axoneme were present, primarily in D. willistoni (subgenus Sophophora). Except for Z. davidi and Z. tuberculatus, the analyzed species had paracrystalline material in both mitochondrial derivatives. Moreover, the testes showed 64 spermatozoa per bundle in all of the species. In the cluster analysis, 6 Zaprionus species were grouped closely, but there were some incongruent positions in the cladogram. The results indicated that sperm ultrastructure is an important tool for elucidating the phylogeny and taxonomy of insects.","117":"Fruit flies are important model organisms for functional testing of candidate genes in multiple disciplines, including the study of human diseases. Here we use a high-throughput locomotor activity assay to test the response on activity behavior of gene disruption in Drosophila melanogaster. The aim was to investigate the impact of disruption of 14 candidate genes for human attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on fly behavior. By obtaining a range of correlated measures describing the space of variables for behavioral activity we show, that some mutants display similar phenotypic responses, and furthermore, that the genes disrupted in those mutants had common molecular functions; namely processes related to cGMP activity, cation channels and serotonin receptors. All but one of the candidate genes resulted in aberrant behavioral activity, suggesting involvement of these genes in behavioral activity in fruit flies. Results provide additional support for the investigated genes being risk candidate genes for ADHD in humans.","118":"","119":"In this Extra View, we extend our recent work on the protein LIN-28 and its role in adult stem cell divisions. LIN-28 is an mRNA- and microRNA-binding protein that is conserved from worms to humans. When expressed ectopically, it promotes the reprogramming of differentiated vertebrate cells into pluripotent stem cells as well as the regeneration of vertebrate tissues after injury. However, its endogenous function in stem cell populations is less clear. We recently reported that LIN-28 is specifically expressed in progenitor cells in the adult Drosophila intestine and enhances insulin signaling within this population. Loss of lin-28 alters the division patterns of these progenitor cells, limiting the growth of the intestinal epithelium that is ordinarily caused by feeding. Thus, LIN-28 is part of an uncharacterized circuit used to remodel a tissue in response to environmental cues like nutrition. Here, we extend this analysis by reporting that the levels of LIN-28 in progenitor cells are sensitive to nutrient availability. In addition, we speculate about the role of LIN-28 in the translational control of target mRNAs such as Insulin Receptor (InR) and how such translational control may be an important mechanism that underlies the stem cell dynamics needed for tissue homeostasis and growth. ","120":"Circadian clocks enable organisms to anticipate daily changes in the environment and coordinate temporal rhythms in physiology and behavior with the 24-h day-night cycle. The robust cycling of circadian gene expression is critical for proper timekeeping, and is regulated by transcription factor binding, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment and elongation, and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Recently, it has become clear that dynamic alterations in chromatin landscape at the level of histone posttranslational modification and nucleosome density facilitate rhythms in transcription factor recruitment and RNAPII activity, and are essential for progression through activating and repressive phases of circadian transcription. Here, we discuss the characterization of the BRAHMA (BRM) chromatin-remodeling protein in Drosophila in the context of circadian clock regulation. By dissecting its catalytic vs. non-catalytic activities, we propose a model in which the non-catalytic activity of BRM functions to recruit repressive factors to limit the transcriptional output of CLOCK (CLK) during the active phase of circadian transcription, while the primary function of the ATP-dependent catalytic activity is to tune and prevent over-recruitment of negative regulators by increasing nucleosome density. Finally, we divulge ongoing efforts and investigative directions toward a deeper mechanistic understanding of transcriptional regulation of circadian gene expression at the chromatin level. ","121":"Drosophila lymph gland, a larval haematopoietic organ, has emerged as a popular model to study regulatory mechanisms controlling blood cell progenitor fate. In this organ, the Posterior Signaling Center (PSC), a small group of cells expressing the EBF transcription factor Collier, has been proposed to act as a niche required for progenitor maintenance. Accordingly, several reports showed that PSC size\/activity modulation impacts on blood cell differentiation. Yet our recent results challenge this model. Indeed, we found that PSC ablation does not affect haematopoietic progenitor maintenance. This unexpected result led us to reinvestigate the role of the PSC and collier in hematopoiesis. Consistent with previous findings, the PSC appears required for the production of a specialized blood cell type in response to parasitization. Moreover, our results indicate that the massive blood cell differentiation observed in collier mutant larvae is not due to the lack of PSC but to collier expression within the haematopoietic progenitors. We thus propose a paradigm shift whereby larval blood cell progenitor maintenance is largely independent of the PSC but requires the cell-autonomous function of collier. ","122":null,"123":"Animals have modular cis-regulatory regions in their genomes, and expression of a single gene is often regulated by multiple enhancers residing in such a region. In the laboratory, and also in natural populations, loss of an enhancer can result in a loss of gene expression. Although only a few examples have been well characterized to date, some studies have suggested that an evolutionary gain of a new enhancer function can establish a new gene expression domain. Our recent study showed that Drosophila guttifera has more enhancers and additional expression domains of the wingless gene during the pupal stage, compared to D. melanogaster, and that these new features appear to have evolved in the ancestral lineage leading to D. guttifera. (1) Gain of a new expression domain of a developmental regulatory gene (toolkit gene), such as wingless, can cause co-option of the expression of its downstream genes to the new domain, resulting in duplication of a preexisting structure at this new body position. Recently, with the advancement of evo-devo studies, we have learned that the developmental regulatory systems are strikingly similar across various animal taxa, in spite of the great diversity of the animals' morphology. Even behind \"new\" traits, co-options of essential developmental genes from known systems are very common. We previously provided concrete evidence of gains of enhancer activities of a developmental regulatory gene underlying gains of new traits. (1) Broad occurrence of this scenario is testable and should be validated in the future. ","124":null,"125":"Drosophila telomeres are maintained by transposition to chromosome ends of the HeT-A, TART and TAHRE retrotransposons, collectively designated as HTT. Although all Drosophila telomeres terminate with HTT arrays and are capped by the terminin complex, they differ in the type of subtelomeric chromatin. The HTT sequences of YS, YL, XR, and 4L are juxtaposed to constitutive heterochromatin, while the HTTs of the other telomeres are linked to either the TAS repeat-associated chromatin (XL, 2L, 2R, 3L, 3R) or to the specialized 4R chromatin. We found that mutations in pendolino (peo) cause (telomeric fusions) that preferentially involve the heterochromatin-associated telomeres (Ha-telomeres), a telomeric fusion pattern never observed in the other 10 telomere-capping mutants characterized so far. Peo, is homologous to the E2 variant ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and is required for DNA replication. Our analyses lead us to hypothesize that DNA replication in Peo-depleted cells results in specific fusigenic lesions concentrated in Ha-telomeres. These data provide the first demonstration that subtelomeres can affect telomere fusion. ","126":"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) ligate amino acids to their cognate tRNAs, allowing them to decode the triplet code during translation. Through different mechanisms aaRSs also perform several non-canonical functions in transcription, translation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and inflammation. Drosophila has become a preferred system to model human diseases caused by mutations in aaRS genes, to dissect effects of reduced translation or non-canonical activities, and to study aminoacylation and translational fidelity. However, the lack of a systematic annotation of this gene family has hampered such studies. Here, we report the identification of the entire set of aaRS genes in the fly genome and we predict their roles based on experimental evidence and\/or orthology. Further, we propose a new, systematic and logical nomenclature for aaRSs. We also review the research conducted on Drosophila aaRSs to date. Together, our work provides the foundation for further research in the fly aaRS field. ","127":"Stem cells are responsible for preserving morphology and function of adult tissues. Stem cells divide to self-renew and to generate progenitor cells to sustain cell demand from the tissue throughout the organism's life. Unlike stem cells, the progenitor cells have limited proliferation potential but have the capacity to terminally differentiate and thereby to substitute older or damaged mature cells. Recent findings indicate that adult stem cells can adapt their division kinetics dynamically to match changes in tissue demand during homeostasis and regeneration. However, cell turnover not only requires stem cell division but also needs timed differentiation of the progenitor cells, which has been much less explored. In this Extra View article, we discuss the ability of progenitor cells to actively postpone terminal differentiation in the absence of a local demand and how tissue demand activates terminal differentiation via a conserved mesenchymal-epithelial transition program revealed in our recent EMBO J paper and other published and unpublished data. The extent of the significance of these results is discussed for models of tissue dynamics during both homeostasis and regeneration.","128":"Drosophila Iroquois (Iro) proteins are components of the TALE homeodomain family of transcriptional regulators. They play key roles in territorial specification and pattern formation. A recent study has disclosed a novel developmental function of the Iro proteins. In the eye and wing imaginal discs, they can regulate the size of the territories that they specify. They do so by cell-autonomously controlling cell cycle progression. Indeed, Iro proteins down-regulate the activity of the CyclinE\/Cdk2 complex by a transcription-independent mechanism. This novel function is executed mainly through 2 evolutionarily conserved domains of the Iro proteins: the Cyclin Binding Domain and the IRO-box, which mediate their binding to CyclinE-containing protein complexes. Here we discuss the functional implications of the control of the cell cycle by Iro proteins for development and oncogenesis. ","129":"Neurons exhibit extreme diversity in size, but whether large neurons have specialized mechanisms to support their growth is largely unknown. Recently, we identified the SLC36 transporter Pathetic (Path) as a factor required for extreme dendrite growth in neurons. Path is broadly expressed, but only neurons with large dendrite arbors or small neurons that are forced to grow large require path for their growth. To gain insight into the basis of growth control by path, we generated additional alleles of path and further examined the apparent specificity of growth defects in path mutants. Here, we confirm our prior finding that loss of path function imposes an upper limit on neuron growth, and additionally report that path likely limits overall neurite length rather than dendrite length alone. Using a GFP knock-in allele of path, we identify additional tissues where path likely functions in nutrient sensing and possibly growth control. Finally, we demonstrate that path regulates translational capacity in a cell type that does not normally require path for growth, suggesting that path may confer robustness on growth programs by buffering translational output. Altogether, these studies suggest that Path is a nutrient sensor with widespread function in Drosophila. ","130":"Mating plugs are hardened structures--typically a coagulation of seminal fluid components--that are transferred to, or formed within, the female reproductive tract of numerous animal species (both mammals and insects). Analysis of the role(s) of the mating plug in reproduction has been conducted in a wide array of diverse species. These structures have been proposed to have a multitude of functions, which include altering female re-mating rate, acting as a barrier to re-mating and being required for sperm storage or sperm movement to occur in mated females. A recent analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster mating plug has shown that proper formation of the structure is required for optimal fertility in flies: the Drosophila mating plug is required to retain the ejaculate within the female reproductive tract once mating has terminated. Here, we discuss the possible implications of the Drosophila mating plug in the fertility of this species in light of these new results.","131":"Recent evidence indicates that protein aggregates can spread between neurons in several neurodegenerative diseases but much remains unknown regarding the underlying mechanisms responsible for this spreading and its role in disease progression. We recently demonstrated that mutant Huntingtin aggregates spread between cells within the Drosophila brain resulting in non-cell autonomous loss of a pair of large neurons in the posterior protocerebrum. However, the full extent of neuronal loss throughout the brain was not determined. Here we examine the effects of driving expression of mutant Huntingtin in Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs) by using a marker for cleaved caspase activity to monitor neuronal apoptosis as a function of age. We find widespread caspase activity in various brain regions over time, demonstrating that non-cell autonomous damage is widespread. Improved understanding of which neurons are most vulnerable and why should be useful in developing treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases that involve transcellular spreading of aggregates. ","132":"Intestinal epithelium in adult Drosophila midgut undergoes regular turnover and renewal. This process is fueled by intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which can self-renew as well as produce both absorptive enterocytes (ECs) and secretory enteroendocrine (EE) cells. Notch signaling plays a decisive role in EC differentiation. However, the mechanisms controlling EE specification is much less understood. Recently we identified a BTB-domain containing transcriptional repressor Ttk69 as an intrinsic factor in repressing EE cell specification. Loss of Ttk69 caused all progenitor cells to adopt EE cell specification, regardless the status of Notch activity. Mechanistically, Ttk69 represses EE specification via a Ttk69-acheate-scute complex (AS-C) genes-Prospero (Pros) regulatory axis. Interestingly, depletion of ttk69 is able to bypass the requirements of many known signaling pathways, such as JAK\/STAT signaling and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (Tsc), in EE cell specification. These observations suggest that Ttk69 acts as a master repressor of EE cell fate. Here, we further tested the effect of Ttk69 in mature hormone-producing EE cells. We found that cell-autonomous overexpression of Ttk69 in differentiated EE cells was sufficient to disrupt their hormone-producing activity, further supporting the notion that Ttk69 is a master repressor of EE cell fate. In this Extra View, we also provide a brief discussion of recent progress and remaining questions concerning EE cell specification in adult Drosophila midgut. ","133":null,"134":"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a subset of small non-coding RNAs enriched in animal gonads, repress transposons by assembling with PIWI proteins to form potent gene-silencing RNP complexes, piRISCs. Accumulating evidence suggests that piRNAs are produced through three interdependent pathways; the de novo primary pathway, the ping-pong pathway, and the phased primary pathway. The de novo primary pathway in Drosophila ovaries produces primary piRNAs for two PIWI members, Piwi and Aub. Aub then initiates the ping-pong pathway to produce secondary piRNAs for AGO3. AGO3-slicer dependent cleavage subsequently produces secondary piRNAs for Aub. Trailer products of AGO3-slicer activity are consumed by the phased primary pathway to increase the Piwi-bound piRNA population. All these pathways are regulated by a number of piRNA factors in a highly coordinated fashion. Recent studies show that two Tudor-domain containing piRNA factors, Krimper (Krimp) and Qin\/Kumo, play crucial roles in making Aub-AGO3 heterotypic ping-pong robust. This maintains the levels of piRNAs loaded onto Piwi and Aub to efficiently repress transposons at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, respectively. ","135":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease causing the death of motor neurons with consequent muscle atrophy and paralysis. Several neurodegenerative diseases have been modeled in Drosophila and genetic studies on this model organism led to the elucidation of crucial aspects of disease mechanisms. ALS, however, has lagged somewhat behind possibly because of the lack of a suitable genetic model. We were the first to develop a fly model for ALS and over the last few years, we have implemented and used this model for a large scale, unbiased modifier screen. We also report an extensive bioinformatic analysis of the genetic modifiers and we show that most of them are associated in a network of interacting genes controlling known as well as novel cellular processes involved in ALS pathogenesis. A similar analysis for the human homologues of the Drosophila modifiers and the validation of a subset of them in human tissues confirm and expand the significance of the data for the human disease. Finally, we analyze a possible application of the model in the process of therapeutic discovery in ALS and we discuss the importance of novel \"non-obvious\" models for the disease. ","136":"The formation of functional musculoskeletal system relies on proper connectivity between muscles and their corresponding tendon cells. In Drosophila, larval muscles are born during early embryonic stages, and elongate toward tendons that are embedded within the ectoderm in later. The Slit\/Robo signaling pathway had been implicated in the process of muscle elongation toward tendons. Here we discuss our recent findings regarding the critical contribution of Slit cleavage for immobilization and stabilization of the Slit signal on the tendon cells. Slit cleavage produces 2 polypeptides, the N-terminal Slit-N, which is extremely stable, undergoes oligomerization, and associates with the tendon cell surfaces, and the C-terminal Slit-C, which rapidly degrades. Slit cleavage leads to immobilization of Slit signaling on tendons, leading to a short-range repulsion, which eventually arrest further muscle elongation. Robo2, which is co-expressed with Slit by the tendon cells facilitates Slit cleavage. This activity does not require the cytoplasmic signaling domain of Robo2. We suggest that Robo2-dependent Slit cleavage, and the formation of Slit-N oligomers on the tendon cell surfaces direct muscle elongation, and provide a stop signal for the approaching muscle, through binding to Robo and Robo3 receptors expressed by the muscles. ","137":"Body pigmentation in insects and other organisms is typically variable within and between species and is often associated with fitness. Regulatory variants with large effects at bab1, t and e affect variation in abdominal pigmentation in several populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Recently, we performed a genome wide association (GWA) analysis of variation in abdominal pigmentation using the inbred, sequenced lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We confirmed the large effects of regulatory variants in bab1, t and e; identified 81 additional candidate genes; and validated 17 candidate genes (out of 28 tested) using RNAi knockdown of gene expression and mutant alleles. However, these analyses are imperfect proxies for the effects of segregating variants. Here, we describe the results of an extreme quantitative trait locus (xQTL) GWA analysis of female body pigmentation in an outbred population derived from light and dark DGRP lines. We replicated the effects on pigmentation of 28 genes implicated by the DGRP GWA study, including bab1, t and e and 7 genes previously validated by RNAi and\/or mutant analyses. We also identified many additional loci. The genetic architecture of Drosophila pigmentation is complex, with a few major genes and many other loci with smaller effects. ","138":"Disruption of epigenetic gene control mechanisms involving histone acetylation in the brain causes cognitive impairment, a debilitating hallmark of most neurodegenerative disorders. Histone acetylation regulates cognitive gene expression via chromatin packaging control in neurons. Unfortunately, the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that generate such neural epigenetic signatures and their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Our recent findings provide insight into this question by demonstrating that Tip60 HAT action is critical for morphology and function of the mushroom body (MB), the learning and memory center in the Drosophila brain. We show that Tip60 is robustly produced in MB Kenyon cells and extending axonal lobes and that targeted MB Tip60 HAT loss results in axonal outgrowth disruption. Functional consequences of loss and gain of Tip60 HAT levels in the MB are evidenced by defects in memory. Tip60 ChIP-Seq analysis reveals enrichment for genes that function in cognitive processes and accordingly, key genes representing these pathways are misregulated in the Tip60 HAT mutant fly brain. Remarkably, increasing levels of Tip60 in the MB rescues learning and memory deficits resulting from Alzheimer's disease associated amyloid precursor protein (APP) induced neurodegeneration. Our studies highlight the potential of HAT activators as a therapeutic option for cognitive disorders. ","139":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The complexity of TBI partly stems from the fact that injuries to the brain instigate non-neurological injuries to other organs such as the intestine. Additionally, genetic variation is thought to play a large role in determining the nature and severity of non-neurological injuries. We recently reported that TBI in flies, as in humans, increases permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier resulting in hyperglycemia and a higher risk of death. Furthermore, we demonstrated that genetic variation in flies is also pertinent to the complexity of non-neurological injuries following TBI. The goals of this review are to place our findings in the context of what is known about TBI-induced intestinal permeability from studies of TBI patients and rodent TBI models and to draw attention to how studies of the fly TBI model can provide unique insights that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment of TBI. ","140":"We developed a Drosophila model in which the dengue virus NS3 protein is expressed in a tissue specific and inducible manner. Dengue virus NS3 is a multifunctional protein playing a major role during viral replication. Both protease and helicase domains of NS3 are interacting with human and insect host proteins including innate immune components of the host machinery. We characterized the NS3 transgenic flies showing that NS3 expression did not affect fly development. To further study the links between NS3 and the innate immune response, we challenge the flies with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, the Drosophila transgenic flies expressing NS3 were more susceptible to bacterial infections than control flies. However ubiquitous or immune-specific NS3 expression affected neither the life span nor the response to a non-infectious stress of the flies. In conclusion, we generated a new in vivo system to study the functional impact of DENV NS3 protein on the innate immune response. ","141":"General anesthetics achieve behavioral unresponsiveness via a mechanism that is incompletely understood. The study of genetic model systems such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is crucial to advancing our understanding of how anesthetic drugs render animals unresponsive. Previous studies have shown that wild-type control strains differ significantly in their sensitivity to general anesthetics, which potentially introduces confounding factors for comparing genetic mutations placed on these wild-type backgrounds. Here, we examined a variety of behavioral and electrophysiological endpoints in Drosophila, in both adult and larval animals. We characterized these endpoints in 3 commonly used fly strains: wild-type Canton Special (CS), and 2 commonly used white-eyed strains, isoCJ1 and w(1118). We found that CS and isoCJ1 show remarkably similar sensitivity to isoflurane across a variety of behavioral and electrophysiological endpoints. In contrast, w(1118) is resistant to isoflurane compared to the other 2 strains at both the adult and larval stages. This resistance is however not reflected at the level of neurotransmitter release at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This suggests that the w(1118) strain harbors another mutation that produces isoflurane resistance, by acting on an arousal pathway that is most likely preserved between larval and adult brains. This mutation probably also affects sleep, as marked differences between isoCJ1 and w(1118) have also recently been found for behavioral responsiveness and sleep intensity measures. ","142":"DEET is the most effective insect repellent available and has been widely used for more than half a century. Here, I review what is known about the olfactory and contact mechanisms of DEET repellency. For mosquitoes, DEET has at least two molecular targets: Odorant Receptors (ORs) mediate the effect of DEET at a distance, while unknown chemoreceptors mediate repellency upon contact. Additionally, the ionotropic receptor Ir40a has recently been identified as a putative DEET chemosensor in Drosophila. The mechanism of how DEET manipulates these molecular targets to induce insect avoidance in the vapor phase is also contested. Two hypotheses are the most likely: DEET activates an innate olfactory neural circuit leading to avoidance of hosts (smell and avoid hypothesis) or DEET has no behavioral effect on its own, but instead acts cooperatively with host odors to drive repellency (confusant hypothesis). Resolving this mystery will inform the search for a new generation of insect repellents. ","143":"Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism for developmental studies. This study tests the potential of semolina-jaggery (SJ) diet as a new formulation for bulk rearing of flies. Semolina and jaggery are organic products obtained from wheat endosperm and cane sugar, respectively. Semolina is a rich source of carbohydrates and protein. Jaggery has a high content of dietary sugars. Moreover, preparation of semolina jaggery diet is cost-effective and easy. Thus, the current study aimed to compare survival and developmental parameters of flies fed the SJ diet to flies fed the standard cornmeal-sugar-yeast (CSY) diet. SJ diet enhanced survival of flies without affecting fecundity; male flies showed increased resistance to starvation. A higher number of flies emerged at F2 and F3 generation when fed the SJ diet than when fed the control CSY diet. SJ diet did not increase fly body weight and lipid percentage. Therefore, SJ diet can be used for bulk rearing of healthy flies at par with the standard cornmeal-sugar-yeast diet. ","144":"Sexual dimorphism is observed in many traits across diverse taxa, and often it is quite extreme. Within a species, individuals of opposing sex can appear strikingly different, reflecting differences at the molecular level that may be similarly striking. Among the most extreme cases of such molecular sexual dimorphism is the quantity of sex chromosomes that each sex possesses. Hemizygous sex chromosomes are common to many species, and various mechanisms have evolved to regulate transcriptional activity to ensure appropriate sex chromosome-to-autosome gene expression stoichiometry. Among the most thoroughly investigated of these mechanisms is Drosophila melanogaster's male-specific lethal (MSL) complex-mediated dosage compensation. In Drosophila, the male X chromosome transcription is upregulated approximately two-fold in somatic tissues to counterbalance the effects of sex chromosome hemizygosity on transcript abundance. Despite dramatic advances in our understanding of the Drosophila dosage compensation, many questions remain unanswered, and our understanding of its molecular underpinnings remains incomplete. In this review, we synthesize recent progress in the field as a means to highlight open questions, including how the MSL complex targets the X chromosome, how dosage compensation has shaped evolution of X-linked genes, and the degree to which MSL complex-mediated dosage compensation varies in activity across somatic tissues. ","145":"Epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure is a fundamental process for eukaryotes. Regulators include DNA methylation, microRNAs and chromatin modifications. Within the chromatin modifiers, one class of enzymes that can functionally bind and modify chromatin, through the removal of methyl marks, is the histone lysine demethylases. Here, we summarize the current findings of the 13 known histone lysine demethylases in Drosophila melanogaster, and discuss the critical role of these histone-modifying enzymes in the maintenance of genomic functions. Additionally, as histone demethylase dysregulation has been identified in cancer, we discuss the advantages for using Drosophila as a model system to study tumorigenesis. ","146":"Maintenance and differentiation of progenitor cells is essential for proper organ development and adaptation to environmental stress and injury. In Drosophila melanogaster, the haematopietic system serves as an ideal model for interrogating the function of signaling pathways required for progenitor maintenance and cell fate determination. Here we focus on the role of the Hippo pathway effectors Yorkie and Scalloped in mediating and facilitating Notch signaling-mediated lineage specification in the lymph gland, the primary center for haematopoiesis within the developing larva. We discuss the regulatory mechanisms which promote Notch activity during normal haematopoiesis and its modulation during immune challenge conditions. We provide additional evidence establishing the hierarchy of signaling events during crystal cell formation, highlighting the relationship between Yorkie, Scalloped and Lozenge, while expanding on the role of Yorkie in promoting hemocyte survival and the developmental regulation of Notch and its ligand, Serrate, within the lymph gland. Finally, we propose additional areas of exploration that may provide mechanistic insight into the environmental and non-cell autonomous regulation of cell fate in the blood system. ","147":"Arthropods employ a large family of up to 100 putative taste or gustatory receptors (Grs) for the recognition of a wide range of non-volatile chemicals. In Drosophila melanogaster, a small subfamily of 8 Gr genes is thought to mediate the detection of sugars, the fly's major nutritional source. However, the specific roles for most sugar Gr genes are not known. Here, we report the generation of a series of mutant sugar Gr knock-in alleles and several composite sugar Gr mutant strains, including a sugar blind strain, which will facilitate the characterization of this gene family. Using Ca(2+) imaging experiments, we show that most gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) of sugar blind flies (lacking all 8 sugar Gr genes) fail to respond to any sugar tested. Moreover, expression of single sugar Gr genes in most sweet GRNs of sugar-blind flies does not restore sugar responses. However, when pair-wise combinations of sugar Gr genes are introduced to sweet GRNs, responses to select sugars are restored. We also examined the cellular phenotype of flies homozygous mutant for Gr64a, a Gr gene previously reported to be a major contributor for the detection of many sugars. In contrast to these claims, we find that sweet GRNs of Gr64a homozygous mutant flies show normal responses to most sugars, and only modestly reduced responses to maltose and maltotriose. Thus, the precisely engineered genetic mutations of single Gr genes and construction of a sugar-blind strain provide powerful analytical tools for examining the roles of Drosophila and other insect sugar Gr genes in sweet taste. ","148":"A recent paper by the Dahankuar laboratory suggested that single Drosophila sugar receptors proteins accurately mediate sugar detection when ectopically expressed in olfactory neurons of the antenna. These findings contra-dict numerous previously published electrophysiological and behavioral investigations, which all point towards heteromultimeric sugar taste receptors. Here, I provide some explanation why this \"pseudo-heterologous\" expression system may have led to this misleading conclusion. ","149":null,"150":"All species of animals display aggression in order to obtain resources such as territories, mates, or food. Appropriate displays of aggression rely on the correct identification of a potential competitor, an evaluation of the environmental signals, and the physiological state of the animal. With a hard-wired circuitry involving fixed numbers of neurons, neuromodulators like serotonin offer adaptive flexibility in behavioral responses without changing the \"hard-wiring\". In a recent report, we combined intersectional genetics, quantitative behavioral assays and morphological analyses to identify single serotonergic neurons that modulate the escalation of aggression. We found anatomical target areas within the brain where these neurons appear to form synaptic contacts with 5HT1A receptor-expressing neurons, and then confirmed the likelihood of those connections on a functional level. In this Extra View article, we offer an extended discussion of these recent findings and elaborate on how they can link a cellular and functional mapping of an aggression-regulating circuit at a single-cell resolution level. ","151":"In insects, localized tissue injury often leads to global (organism-wide) delays in development and retarded metamorphosis. In Drosophila, for example, injuries to the larval imaginal discs can retard pupariation and prolong metamorphosis. Injuries induced by treatments such as radiation, mechanical damage and induction of localized cell death can trigger similar delays. In most cases, the duration of the developmental delay appears to be correlated with the extent of damage, but the effect is also sensitive to the developmental stage of the treated animal. The proximate cause of the delays is likely a disruption of the ecdysone signaling pathway, but the intermediate steps leading from tissue injury and\/or regeneration to that disruption remain unknown. Here, we review the evidence for injury-induced developmental delays, and for a checkpoint or checkpoints associated with the temporal progression of development and the on-going efforts to define the mechanisms involved. ","152":null,"153":"The Wnt\/Wingless (Wg) signaling cascade controls a number of biological processes in animal development and adult life; aberrant Wnt\/Wg signaling can cause diseases. In the 1980s genes were discovered that encode core Wnt\/Wg pathway components: their mutant phenotypes were similar and an outline of a signaling cascade emerged. Over the years our knowledge of this important signaling system increased and more components were uncovered that are instrumental for Wnt\/Wg secretion and transduction. Here we provide an overview of these discoveries, the technologies involved, with a particular focus on the important role Drosophila screens played in this process. ","154":"Among animals with multiple reproductive episodes, changes in adult condition over time can have profound effects on lifetime reproductive fitness and offspring performance. The changes in condition associated with senescence can be particularly acute for females who support reproductive processes from oogenesis through fertilization. The pomace fly Drosophila melanogaster is a well-established model system for exploring the physiology of reproduction and senescence. In this review, we describe how increasing maternal age in Drosophila affects reproductive fitness and offspring performance as well as the genetic foundation of these effects. Describing the processes underlying female reproductive senescence helps us understand diverse phenomena including population demographics, condition-dependent selection, sexual conflict, and transgenerational effects of maternal condition on offspring fitness. Understanding the genetic basis of reproductive senescence clarifies the nature of life-history trade-offs as well as potential ways to augment and\/or limit female fertility in a variety of organisms. ","155":"Molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning of central pattern generators (CPGs) are poorly understood. Investigations using genetic approaches in the model organism Drosophila may help to identify unknown molecular players participating in the formation or control of motor patterns. Here we report Drosophila genes as candidates for involvement in the neural mechanisms responsible for motor functions, such as locomotion and courtship song. Twenty-two Drosophila lines, used for gene identification, were isolated from a previously created collection of 1064 lines, each carrying a P element insertion in one of the autosomes. The lines displayed extreme deviations in locomotor and\/or courtship song parameters compared with the whole collection. The behavioral consequences of CNS-specific RNAi-mediated knockdowns for 10 identified genes were estimated. The most prominent changes in the courtship song interpulse interval (IPI) were seen in flies with Sps2 or CG15630 knockdown. Glia-specific knockdown of these genes produced no effect on the IPI. Estrogen-induced knockdown of CG15630 in adults reduced the IPI. The product of the CNS-specific gene, CG15630 (a predicted cell surface receptor), is likely to be directly involved in the functioning of the CPG generating the pulse song pattern. Future studies should ascertain its functional role in the neurons that constitute the song CPG. Other genes (Sps2, CG34460), whose CNS-specific knockdown resulted in IPI reduction, are also worthy of detailed examination. ","156":"Although intron losses have been widely reported, it is not clear whether they are neutral and therefore random or driven by positive selection. Intron transcription and splicing are time-consuming and can delay the expression of its host gene. For genes that must be activated quickly to respond to physiological or stress signals, intron delay may be deleterious. Promoter proximally paused (PPP) genes are a group of rapidly expressed genes. To respond quickly to activation signals, they generally initiate transcription competently but stall after synthesizing a short RNA. In this study, performed in Drosophila melanogaster, the PPP genes were found to have a significantly higher rate of intron loss than control genes. However, further analysis did not find more significant shrinkage of intron size in PPP genes. Referring to previous studies on the rates of transcription and splicing and to the time saved by deletion of the introns from mouse gene Hes7, it is here suggested that transcription delay is comparable to splicing delay only when the intron is 28.5 kb or larger, which is greater in size than 95% of vertebrate introns, 99.5% of Drosophila introns, and all the annotated introns of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. Delays in intron splicing are probably a selective force, promoting intron loss from quickly expressed genes. In other genes, it may have been an exaptation during the emergency of developmental clocks. ","157":"Sumoylation, the covalent attachment of SUMO, a 90 amino acid peptide related to ubiquitin, is a major modulator of protein functions. Fluorescent SUMO protein fusions have been used in cell cultures to visualize SUMO in vivo but not in multicellular organisms. We generated a transgenic line of Drosophila expressing an mCherry-SUMO fusion. We analyzed its pattern in vivo in salivary gland nuclei expressing Venus-HP1 to recognize the different chromatin components (Chromocenter, chromosome IV). We compared it to SUMO immunostaining on squashed polytene chromosomes and observed similar patterns. In addition to the previously reported SUMO localizations (chromosome arms and chromocenter), we identify 2 intense binding sites: the fourth chromosome telomere and the DAPI-bright band in the region 81F. ","158":"In eukaryotes, abnormally circularized chromosomes, known as 'rings,' can be mitotically unstable. Some rings derived from a compound X-Y chromosome induce mitotic abnormalities during the embryonic cleavage divisions and early death in Drosophila melanogaster, but the underlying basis is poorly understood. We recently demonstrated that a large region of 359-bp satellite DNA, which normally resides on the X chromosome, prevents sister ring chromatids from segregating properly during these divisions. Cytogenetic comparisons among 3 different X-Y rings with varying levels of lethality showed that all 3 contain similar amounts of 359-bp DNA, but the repetitive sequences surrounding the 359-bp DNA differ in each case. This finding suggests that ring misbehavior results from novel heterochromatin position effects on the 359-bp satellite. The purpose of this view is to explore possible explanations for these effects with regard to heterochromatin formation and replication of repetitive sequences. Also discussed are similarities of this system to a satellite-based hybrid incompatibility and potential influences on genome evolution. ","159":"Seminal proteins are critical for reproductive success in all animals that have been studied. Although seminal proteins have been identified in many taxa, and female reproductive responses to receipt of these proteins have been documented in several, little is understood about the mechanisms by which seminal proteins affect female reproductive physiology. To explore this topic, we investigated how a Drosophila seminal protein, ovulin, increases ovulation rate in mated females. Ovulation is a relatively simple physiological process, with known female regulators: previous studies have shown that ovulation rate is promoted by the neuromodulator octopamine (OA) in D. melanogaster and other insects. We found that ovulin stimulates ovulation by increasing OA signaling in the female. This finding supports a model in which a male seminal protein acts through \"hacking\" a well-conserved, regulatory system females use to adjust reproductive output, rather than acting downstream of female mechanisms of control or in parallel pathways altogether. We also discuss similarities between 2 forms of intersexual control of behavior through chemical communication: seminal proteins and pheromones. ","160":"Immune responses and metabolic regulation are tightly coupled in all animals, but the underlying mechanistic connections are nowhere completely clear. In flies and in humans, prolonged or excessive immune activation can drive metabolic disruption and cause loss of metabolic stores. Conversely, disruptions of metabolic homeostasis, such as periods of malnutrition, can have significant impacts on immune function. We have recently identified the transcription factor MEF2 as a critical switch between anabolic and immune function in the adult Drosophila fat body. A conserved phosphorylation determines the affinity of MEF2 for the TATA-binding protein, effecting a choice between energy storage and immune function. The goal of this review is to place this molecular event in the broader context of metabolic-immune interaction in Drosophila, exploring what is and is not known about the ties between these 2 critical physiological functions. ","161":"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, innately avoids even low levels of CO2. CO2 is part of the so-called Drosophila stress odor produced by stressed flies, but also a byproduct of fermenting fruit, a main food source, making the strong avoidance behavior somewhat surprising. Therefore, we addressed whether feeding states might influence the fly's behavior and processing of CO2. In a recent report, we showed that this innate behavior is differentially processed and modified according to the feeding state of the fly. Interestingly, we found that hungry flies require the function of the mushroom body, a higher brain center required for olfactory learning and memory, but thought to be dispensable for innate olfactory behaviors. In addition, we anatomically and functionally characterized a novel bilateral projection neuron connecting the CO2 sensory input to the mushroom body. This neuron was essential for processing of CO2 in the starved fly but not in the fed fly. In this Extra View article, we provide evidence for the potential involvement of the neuromodulator dopamine in state-dependent CO2 avoidance behavior. Taken together, our work demonstrates that CO2 avoidance behavior is mediated by alternative neural pathways in a context-dependent manner. Furthermore, it shows that the mushroom body is not only involved in processing of learned olfactory behavior, as previously suggested, but also in context-dependent innate olfaction. ","162":"Recent studies show that nuclear lamins, the type V intermediate filament proteins, are required for proper building of at least some organs. As the major structural components of the nuclear lamina found underneath the inner nuclear membranes, lamins are ubiquitously expressed in all animal cells. How the broadly expressed lamins support the building of specific tissues is not understood. By studying Drosophila testis, we have uncovered a mechanism by which lamin-B functions in the cyst stem cell (CySC) and its differentiated cyst cell, the cell types known to form the niche\/microenvironment for the germline stem cells (GSC) and the developing germ line, to ensure testis organogenesis (1). In this extra view, we discuss some remaining questions and the implications of our findings in the understanding of how the ubiquitous nuclear lamina regulates tissue building in a context-dependent manner. ","163":"Nasrat and Polehole, two Drosophila proteins related functionally and by sequence, are secreted from the oocyte and incorporated into the vitelline membrane, where they play a role in the integrity of the same and in the activation of embryonic Torso RTK. In addition, they also accumulate in a punctate pattern in the follicular epithelium. Here we show that their accumulation at the follicle cells depends on their gene expression in the germline, indicating that these proteins move from the oocyte to the follicle cells in a process that does not require endocytosis. Finally we used cell markers to examine the distribution of these proteins at the follicle cells and show they accumulated in aggregates with vitelline membrane proteins in close association with the plasmatic membrane. We propose that these aggregates represent spatially restricted sinks for vitelline membrane proteins that fail to be incorporated into vitelline bodies and later on into the vitelline membrane. ","164":"Courtship is pivotal to successful reproduction throughout the animal kingdom. Sexual differences in the nervous system are thought to underlie courtship behavior. Male courtship behavior in Drosophila is in large part regulated by the gene fruitless (fru). fru has been reported to encode at least three putative BTB-zinc-finger transcription factors predicted to have different DNA-binding specificities. Although a large number of previous studies have demonstrated that fru plays essential roles in male courtship behavior, we know little about the function of Fru isoforms at the molecular level. Our recent study revealed that male-specific Fru isoforms are expressed in highly overlapping subsets of neurons in the male brain and ventral nerve cord. Fru isoforms play both distinct and redundant roles in male courtship behavior. Importantly, we have identified for the first time, by means of the DamID technique, direct Fru transcriptional target genes. Fru target genes overwhelmingly represent genes previously reported to be involved in the nervous system development, such as CadN, lola and pdm2. Our study provides important insight into how the sexually dimorphic neural circuits underlying reproductive behavior are established. ","165":"Gene duplication is thought to play a key role in phenotypic innovation. While several processes have been hypothesized to drive the retention and functional evolution of duplicate genes, their genomic contributions have never been determined. We recently developed the first genome-wide method to classify these processes by comparing distances between expression profiles of duplicate genes and their ancestral single-copy orthologs. Application of our approach to spatial gene expression profiles in two Drosophila species revealed that a majority of young duplicate genes possess new functions, and that new functions are acquired rapidly-often within a few million years. Surprisingly, new functions tend to arise in younger copies of duplicate gene pairs. Moreover, we found that young duplicates are often specifically expressed in testes, whereas old duplicates are broadly expressed across several tissues, providing strong support for the hypothetical \"out-of-testes\" origin of new genes. In this Extra View, I discuss our findings in the context of theoretical predictions about gene duplication, with a particular emphasis on the importance of natural selection in the evolution of novel phenotypes. ","166":"In the article \"Predetermined embryonic glial cells form the distinct glial sheaths of the Drosophila peripheral nervous system\" we combined our expertise to identify glial cells of the embryonic peripheral nervous system on a single cell resolution with the possibility to genetically label cells using Flybow. We show that all 12 embryonic peripheral glial cells (ePG) per abdominal hemisegment persist into larval (and even adult) stages and differentially contribute to the three distinct glial layers surrounding peripheral nerves. Repetitive labelings of the same cell further revealed that layer affiliation, morphological expansion, and control of proliferation are predetermined and subject to an intrinsic differentiation program. Interestingly, wrapping and subperineurial glia undergo enormous hypertrophy in response to larval growth and elongation of peripheral nerves, while perineurial glia respond to the same environmental changes with hyperplasia. Increase in cell number from embryo (12 cells per hemisegment) to third instar (up to 50 cells per hemisegment) is the result of proliferation of a single ePG that serves as transient progenitor and only contributes to the outermost perineurial glial layer. ","167":"The SAGA chromatin modifying complex functions as a transcriptional coactivator for a large number of genes, and SAGA dysfunction has been linked to carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative disease. The protein complex is comprised of approximately 20 subunits, arranged in a modular fashion, and includes 2 enzymatic subunits: the Gcn5 acetyltransferase and the Non-stop deubiquitinase. As we learn more about SAGA, it becomes evident that this complex functions through sophisticated mechanisms that support very precise regulation of gene expression. Here we describe recent findings in which a Drosophila loss-of-function model revealed novel mechanisms for regulation of SAGA-mediated histone H2B deubiquitination. This model also yielded novel and surprising insights into mechanisms that underlie progressive neurodegenerative disease. Lastly, we comment on the utility of Drosophila as a model for neurodegenerative disease through which crucial and conserved mechanisms may be revealed.

PD-linked G2019S and I2020T mutations in the kinase domain of LRRK2 result in elevated kinase activity, which is required for the toxicity of these pathogenic variants in cell and animal models of PD. We recently reported that LRRK2 interacts with and phosphorylates a number of mammalian ribosomal proteins, several of which exhibit increased phosphorylation via both G2019S and I2020T LRRK2. Blocking the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s15 through expression of phospho-deficient T136A s15 prevents age-associated locomotor deficits and dopamine neuron loss caused by G2019S LRRK2 expression in Drosophila indicating that s15 is a pathogenic LRRK2 substrate. We previously described that G2019S LRRK2 causes an induction of bulk mRNA translation that is blocked by T136A s15 or the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. Here, we report the protective effects of the eIF4E\/eIF4G interaction inhibitor 4EGI-1, in preventing neurodegenerative phenotypes in G2019S LRRK2 flies, and discuss how our findings and those of other groups provide a framework to begin investigating the mechanistic impact of LRRK2 on translation. ","170":"We recently uncovered a novel genetic mechanism that generates the phenotypic uniformity, or canalization, of BMP signaling and cell fate specification during patterning of the dorsal-ventral (D\/V) axis in D. melanogaster embryos. We went on to show that other wild-type Drosophila species lack this canalizing genetic circuitry and, consequently, have non-robust D\/V patterning. In this review, we propose molecular mechanisms that may give rise to stereotyped BMP signaling, and we identify an additional species that could have decanalized D\/V patterning. Extension of these analyses could in turn help explain why canalization is not a universal necessity for species survival. ","171":"The FGFR pathway triggers a wide range of key biological responses. Among others, the Breathless (Btl, Drosophila FGFR1) receptor cascade promotes cell migration during embryonic tracheal system development. However, how the actin cytoskeleton responds to Btl pathway activation to induce cell migration has remained largely unclear. Our recent results shed light into this issue by unveiling a link between the actin-bundling protein Singed (Sn) and the Btl pathway. We showed that the Btl pathway regulates sn, which leads to the stabilization of the actin bundles required for filopodia formation and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. This regulation contributes to tracheal migration, tracheal branch fusion and tracheal cell elongation. Parallel actin bundles (PABs) are usually cross-linked by more than one actin-bundling protein. Accordingly, we have also shown that sn synergistically interacts with forked (f), another actin crosslinker. In this Extra View we extend f analysis and hypothesize how both actin-bundling proteins may act together to regulate the PABs during tracheal embryonic development. Although both proteins are required for similar tracheal events, we suggest that Sn is essential for actin bundle initiation and stiffening, while F is required for the lengthening and further stabilization of the PABs. ","172":"In this Extra View we comment on our recent work on Sudestada1 (Sud1), a Drosophila 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenase that belongs to the Ribosomal Oxygenase (ROX) subfamily. Sud1 is required for normal growth in Drosophila, and is conserved in yeast and mammals. We reported that Sud1 hydroxylates the ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23), and that its loss of function restricts growth and provokes activation of the unfolded protein response, apoptosis and autophagy. In this Extra View we speculate on the role that RPS23 hydroxylation might play in stop codon recognition and on the possible link between Sud1 loss-of-function and activation of the Unfolded Protein Response, Stress Granules formation and growth impairment.

Both halves of the translocation carry visible markers, as well as P-element ends that enable molecular confirmation. Halves of these translocations can be separated to produce offspring with duplications and with lethal second chromosome deficiencies . Such large deficiencies are otherwise tedious to generate and maintain.","174":"Nature presents plenty of examples of cellular behavior that determines the shape of an organ during development, such as epithelial polarity and cell division orientation. Little is known, however, about how organs regenerate or how cellular behavior affects regeneration. One of the most exciting aspects of regeneration biology is understanding how proliferation and patterning are coordinated, since it means that cells not only have to proliferate but also have to do so in an ordered manner so that organs are reconstructed proportionally. Drosophila wing imaginal discs and adult wings are models used in different approaches to investigate this issue; they have recently been used to reveal that, after localized cell death, neighboring cells change their cell division orientation toward the damaged zone. During this process, cell polarity and spindle orientation operate in coordination with cell proliferation to regenerate proper organ size and shape. ","175":"During the third and final larval instar stage, thousands of pluripotent cells within the Drosophila eye imaginal disc are transformed into a near perfect neurocrystalline lattice of 800 unit eyes called ommatidia. This transformation begins with the initiation of the morphogenetic furrow at the posterior margin of the eye field. The furrow, which marks the leading edge of a wave of differentiation, passes across the epithelium transforming unpatterned and undifferentiated cells into rows of periodically spaced clusters of photoreceptor neurons. As cells enter and exit the furrow they undergo dramatic alterations in cellular architecture and gene expression, many of which are required to propel the furrow forward and for proper cell fate specification. The Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways are required for the initiation and progression of the furrow, respectively. Consistent with a role in furrow progression, the loss of Hh pathway activity results in a \"furrow stop\" phenotype. In contrast, reductions in levels of the helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Extramacrochaetae (Emc), lead to the polar opposite phenotype--the furrow accelerates. Recently, we demonstrated that the furrow stop and furrow acceleration phenotypes are molecularly connected. Emc appears to serve as a brake on the furrow by dampening the activity of the Hh pathway. Loss of Emc leads to an upsurge in Hh pathway activity and a faster moving furrow. The acceleration of the furrow appears to be due to an increase in levels of the full-length isoform of Cubitus Interruptus (Ci (155)) and Suppressor of Fused [Su(fu)]. Here we will briefly review the mechanisms by which Hh drives and Emc impedes the progression of the furrow across the developing retina.","176":"Xenobiotic and oxidative responses protect cells from external and internal toxicities. Nrf2 and Keap1 are central factors that mediate these responses, and are closely related with many human diseases. In a recent study, we revealed novel developmental function and regulatory mechanism of Nrf2 and Keap1 by investigating their Drosophila homolog CncC and dKeap1. We found that CncC and dKeap1 control metamorphosis through regulations of ecdysone biosynthetic genes and ecdysone response genes in different tissues. CncC and dKeap1 cooperatively activate these developmental genes, in contrast to their conserved antagonizing effect to xenobiotic response transcription. In addition, interactions between CncC and Ras signaling in metamorphosis and in transcriptional regulation were established. Here I discuss the implications that place these classic xenobiotic response factors into a broader network that potentially control development and oncogenesis using mechanisms other than those mediating xenobiotic response. ","177":"Ring canals are made from arrested cleavage furrows, and provide direct cytoplasmic connections among sibling cells. They are well documented for their participation in Drosophila oogenesis, but little is known about their role in several somatic tissues in which they are also found. Using a variety of genetic tools in live and fixed tissue, we recently demonstrated that rapid intercellular exchange occurs through somatic ring canals by diffusion, and presented evidence that ring canals permit equilibration of protein among transcriptionally mosaic cells. We also used a novel combination of markers to evaluate the extent of protein movement within and across mitotic clones in follicle cells and imaginal discs, providing evidence of robust movement of GFP between the 2 sides of mitotic clones and frequently into non-recombined cells. These data suggest that, depending on the experimental setup and proteins of interest, inter-clonal diffusion of protein may alter the interpretation of clonal data in follicle cells. Here, we discuss these results and provide additional insight into the impact of ring canals in Drosophila somatic tissues. ","178":"The detection of nutrients, both in food and within the body, is crucial for the regulation of feeding behavior, growth, and metabolism. While the molecular basis for sensing food chemicals by the taste system has been firmly linked to specific taste receptors, relatively little is known about the molecular nature of the sensors that monitor nutrients internally. Recent reports of taste receptors expressed in other organ systems, foremost in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals and insects, has led to the proposition that some taste receptors may also be used as sensors of internal nutrients. Indeed, we provided direct evidence that the Drosophila gustatory receptor 43a (Gr43a) plays a critical role in sensing internal fructose levels in the fly brain. In addition to the brain and the taste system, Gr43a is also expressed in neurons of the proventricular ganglion and the uterus. Here, we discuss the multiple potential roles of Gr43a in the fly. We also provide evidence that its activation in the brain is likely mediated by the neuropeptide Corazonin. Finally, we posit that Gr43a may represent only a precedent for other taste receptors that sense internal nutrients, not only in flies but, quite possibly, in other animals, including mammals. ","179":"One of the key aspects of functional nervous systems is the restriction of particular neural subtypes to specific regions, which permits the establishment of differential segment-specific neuromuscular networks. Although Hox genes play a major role in shaping the anterior-posterior body axis during animal development, our understanding of how they act in individual cells to determine particular traits at precise developmental stages is rudimentary. We have used the abdominal leucokinergic neurons (ABLKs) to address this issue. These neurons are generated during both embryonic and postembryonic neurogenesis by the same progenitor neuroblast, and are designated embryonic and postembryonic ABLKs, respectively. We report that the genes of the Bithorax-Complex, Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and abdominal-A (abd-A) are redundantly required to specify the embryonic ABLKs. Moreover, the segment-specific pattern of the postembryonic ABLKs, which are restricted to the most anterior abdominal segments, is controlled by the absence of Abdominal-B (Abd-B), which we found was able to repress the expression of the neuropeptide leucokinin. We discuss this and other examples of how Hox genes generate diversity within the central nervous system of Drosophila. ","180":"The type II CRISPR\/Cas9 system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\/CRISPR-associated) has recently emerged as an efficient and simple tool for site-specific engineering of eukaryotic genomes. To improve its applications in Drosophila genome engineering, we simplified the standard two-component CRISPR\/Cas9 system by generating a stable transgenic fly line expressing the Cas9 endonuclease in the germline (Vasa-Cas9 line). By injecting vectors expressing engineered target-specific guide RNAs into Vasa-Cas9 fly embryos, mutations were generated from site-specific DNA cleavages and efficiently transmitted into progenies. Because Cas9 endonuclease is the universal component of the type II CRISPR\/Cas9 system, site-specific genomic engineering based on this improved platform can be achieved with lower complexity and toxicity, greater consistency, and excellent versatility. ","181":"Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is widely used for mapping DNA-protein interactions across eukaryotic genomes in cells, tissues or even whole organisms. Critical to this procedure is the efficient cross-linking of chromatin-associated proteins to DNA sequences that are in close proximity. Since the mid-nineties formaldehyde fixation has been the method of choice. However, some protein-DNA complexes cannot be successfully captured for ChIP using formaldehyde. One such formaldehyde refractory complex is the developmentally regulated insulator factor, Elba. Here we describe a new embryo fixation procedure using the bi-functional cross-linking reagents DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) and DSP (dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate). We show that unlike standard formaldehyde fixation protocols, it is possible to capture Elba association with insulator elements in 2-5 h embryos using this new cross-linking procedure. We show that this new cross-linking procedure can also be applied to localize nuclear proteins that are amenable to ChIP using standard formaldehyde cross-linking protocols, and that in the cases tested the enrichment was generally superior to that achieved using formaldehyde cross-linking. ","182":"Chemotaxis, the ability to direct movements according to chemical cues in the environment, is important for the survival of most organisms. In our original article, we combined a quantitative behavioral assay with genetic manipulations to dissect the neural substrate for chemotaxis. In this Extra View article, we offer a more chronological narration of the findings leading to our key conclusion that aversion engages specific motor-related circuits and kinematics. We speculate on the separation and crosstalk between aversion and attraction circuits in the brain and the ventral nerve cord, and the implication for valence encoding in the olfactory system. ","183":null,"184":"The CRISPR\/Cas9 system has attracted significant attention for its potential to transform genome engineering. We and others have recently shown that the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease can be employed to engineer the Drosophila genome, and that these modifications are efficiently transmitted through the germline. A single targeting RNA can guide Cas9 to a specific genomic sequence where it induces double-strand breaks that, when imperfectly repaired, yield mutations. We have also demonstrated that 2 targeting RNAs can be used to generate large defined deletions and that Cas9 can catalyze gene replacement by homologous recombination. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have shown similar promise in Drosophila. However, the ease of producing targeting RNAs over the generation of unique sequence-directed nucleases to guide site-specific modifications makes the CRISPR\/Cas9 system an appealingly accessible method for genome editing. From the initial planning stages, engineered flies can be obtained within a month. Here we highlight the variety of genome modifications facilitated by the CRISPR\/Cas9 system along with key considerations for starting your own CRISPR genome engineering project. ","185":"The Drosophila effete gene encodes an extremely conserved class I E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Growing evidence indicates that Eff is involved in many cellular processes including eye development, maintenance of female germline stem cells, and regulation of apoptosis. Eff is also a major component of Drosophila chromatin and it is particularly enriched in chromatin with repressive properties. In addition, Eff is required for telomere protection and to prevent telomere fusion. Consistent with its multiple roles in chromatin maintenance, Eff is also one of the rare factors that modulate both telomere-induced and heterochromatin-induced position effect variegation. ","186":"In nature, larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are commonly infected by parasitoid wasps. Following infection, flies mount an immune response termed cellular encapsulation in which fly immune cells form a multilayered capsule that covers and kills the wasp egg. Parasitoids have thus evolved virulence factors to suppress cellular encapsulation. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiwasp response, we and others have begun identifying and functionally characterizing these virulence factors. Our recent work on the Drosophila parasitoid Ganaspis sp.1 has demonstrated that a virulence factor encoding a SERCA-type calcium pump plays an important role in Ganaspis sp.1 virulence. This venom SERCA antagonizes fly immune cell calcium signaling and thereby prevents the activation of the encapsulation response. In this way, the study of wasp virulence factors has revealed a novel aspect of fly immunity, namely a role for calcium signaling in fly immune cell activation, which is conserved with human immunity, again illustrating the marked conservation between fly and mammalian immune responses. Our findings demonstrate that the cellular encapsulation response can serve as a model of immune cell function and can also provide valuable insight into basic cell biological processes. ","187":"Transposable element (TE) activity is repressed in the Drosophila germline by Piwi-Interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs. These piRNAs are produced by discrete genomic loci containing TE fragments. In a recent publication, we tested for the existence of a strict epigenetic induction of piRNA production capacity by a locus in the D. melanogaster genome. We used 2 lines carrying a transgenic 7-copy tandem cluster (P-lacZ-white) at the same genomic site. This cluster generates in both lines a local heterochromatic sector. One line (T-1) produces high levels of ovarian piRNAs homologous to the P-lacZ-white transgenes and shows a strong capacity to repress homologous sequences in trans, whereas the other line (BX2) is devoid of both of these capacities. The properties of these 2 lines are perfectly stable over generations. We have shown that the maternal transmission of a cytoplasm carrying piRNAs from the first line can confer to the inert transgenic locus of the second, a totally de novo capacity to produce high levels of piRNAs as well as the ability to induce homology-dependent silencing in trans. These new properties are stably inherited over generations (n&gt;50). Furthermore, the converted locus has itself become able to convert an inert transgenic locus via cytoplasmic maternal inheritance. This results in a stable epigenetic conversion process, which can be performed recurrently--a phenomenon termed paramutation and discovered in Maize 60 y ago. Paramutation in Drosophila corresponds to the first stable paramutation in animals and provides a model system to investigate the epigenetically induced emergence of a piRNA-producing locus, a crucial step in epigenome shaping. In this Extra View, we discuss some additional functional aspects and the possible molecular mechanism of this piRNA-linked paramutation.","188":"Drosophila embryo dorsoventral polarity is established by a maternally encoded signal transduction pathway in which three sequentially acting serine proteases, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter, generate the ligand that activates the Toll receptor on the ventral side of the embryo. The spatial regulation of this pathway depends upon ventrally restricted expression of the Pipe sulfotransferase in the ovarian follicle during egg formation. Several recent observations have advanced our understanding of the mechanism regulating the spatially restricted activation of Toll. First, several protein components of the vitelline membrane layer of the eggshell have been determined to be targets of Pipe-mediated sulfation. Second, the processing of Easter by Snake has been identified as the first Pipe-dependent, ventrally-restricted processing event in the pathway. Finally, Gastrulation Defective has been shown to undergo Pipe-dependent, ventral localization within the perivitelline space and to facilitate Snake-mediated processing of Easter. Together, these observations suggest that Gastrulation Defective, localized on the interior ventral surface of the eggshell in association with Pipe-sulfated eggshell proteins, recruits and mediates an interaction between Snake and Easter. This event leads to ventrally-restricted processing and activation of Easter and consequently, localized formation of the Toll ligand, and Toll activation. ","189":"Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the huntingtin (Htt) gene. Despite years of research, there is no treatment that extends life for patients with the disorder. Similarly, little is known about which cellular pathways that are altered by pathogenic Huntingtin (Htt) protein expression are correlated with neuronal loss. As part of a longstanding effort to gain insights into HD pathology, we have been studying the protein in the context of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. We generated transgenic HD models in Drosophila by engineering flies that carry a 12-exon fragment of the human Htt gene with or without the toxic trinucleotide repeat expansion. We also created variants with a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) tag fused to Htt that allows in vivo imaging of Htt protein localization and aggregation. While wild-type Htt remains diffuse throughout the cytoplasm of cells, pathogenic Htt forms insoluble aggregates that accumulate in neuronal soma and axons. Aggregates can physically block transport of numerous organelles along the axon. We have also observed that aggregates are formed quickly, within just a few hours of mutant Htt expression. To explore mechanisms of neurodegeneration in our HD model, we performed in vivo and in vitro screens to search for modifiers of viability and pathogenic Htt aggregation. Our results identified several novel candidates for HD therapeutics that can now be tested in mammalian models of HD. Furthermore, these experiments have highlighted the complex relationship between aggregates and toxicity that exists in HD. ","190":"Maintenance of genomic stability during eukaryotic cell division relies on the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), which has evolved as a surveillance mechanism that monitors kinetochore-microtubule attachment and prevents APC\/C-mediated mitotic exit until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. Reversible protein phosphorylation has long been accredited as a regulatory mechanism of the SAC. Nevertheless, knowledge of how several mitotic kinases act in concert within the signaling pathway to orchestrate SAC function is still emerging. In a recent study, we undertook a comprehensive dissection of the hierarchical framework controlling SAC function in Drosophila cells. We found that Polo lies at the top of the SAC pathway promoting the efficient recruitment of Mps1 to unattached kinetochores. This renders Mps1 fully active to control BubR1 phosphorylation that generates the 3F3\/2 phosphoepitope at tensionless kinetochores. We have proposed that Polo is required for SAC function and that the molecular outcome of Mps1-dependent 3F3\/2 formation is to promote the association of Cdc20 with BubR1 allowing proper kinetochore recruitment of Cdc20 and efficient assembly of the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC) required for a sustained SAC response. ","191":"The antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) pathway processes viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNA) that guide the recognition and cleavage of complementary viral target RNAs. In RNA virus infections, viral replication intermediates, dsRNA genomes or viral structured RNAs have been implicated as Dicer-2 substrates. In a recent publication, we demonstrated that a double-stranded DNA virus, Invertebrate iridescent virus 6, is a target of the Drosophila RNAi machinery, and we proposed that overlapping converging transcripts base pair to form the dsRNA substrates for vsiRNA biogenesis. Here, we discuss the role of RNAi in antiviral defense to DNA viruses in Drosophila and other invertebrate model systems. ","192":"The NimC1 molecule has been described as a phagocytosis receptor, and is being used as a marker for professional phagocytes, the plasmatocytes, in Drosophila melanogaster. In studies including tumor-biology, developmental biology, and cell mediated immunity, monoclonal antibodies (P1a and P1b) to the NimC1 antigen are used. As we observed that these antibodies did not react with plasmatocytes of several strains and genetic combinations, a molecular analysis was performed on the structure of the nimC1 gene. In these strains we found 2 deletions and an insertion within the nimC1 gene, which may result in the production of a truncated NimC1 protein. The NimC1 positivity was regained by recombining the mutation with a wild-type allele or by using nimC1 mutant lines under heterozygous conditions. By means of these procedures or using the recombined stock, NimC1 can be used as a marker for phagocytic cells in the majority of the possible genetic backgrounds. ","193":"Hedgehog (Hh) is a signaling ligand conserved from flies to humans that is covalently bound to both palmitate and cholesterol moieties. These lipid modifications are crucial for Hh signaling. A recent article reports that in both flies and human-cultured cells a cholesterol-free form of Hh (SHh-N*\/Hh-N*) is produced and secreted. In the Drosophila wing disc, Hh associated with Lipoproteins-lipophorin complexes (Lpp) would lead to the accumulation of Cubitus interruptus (Ci), the transcription factor in the Hh pathway but this would be insufficient to activate Hh target genes. On the other hand, Lpp-free Hh-N* would act in synergy with Lpp-associated Hh to eventually activate target gene expression. This suggests that Hh can be secreted in 2 different forms that would have distinct and synergic functions. ","194":"Facultative heritable bacterial endosymbionts can have dramatic effects on their hosts, ranging from mutualistic to parasitic. Within-host bacterial endosymbiont density plays a critical role in maintenance of a symbiotic relationship, as it can affect levels of vertical transmission and expression of phenotypic effects, both of which influence the infection prevalence in host populations. Species of genus Drosophila are infected with Spiroplasma, whose characterized phenotypic effects range from that of a male-killing reproductive parasite to beneficial defensive endosymbiont. For many strains of Spiroplasma infecting at least 17 species of Drosophila, however, the phenotypic effects are obscure. The infection prevalence of these Spiroplasma vary within and among Drosophila species, and little is known about the within-host density dynamics of these diverse strains. To characterize the patterns of Spiroplasma density variation among Drosophila we used quantitative PCR to assess bacterial titer at various life stages of three species of Drosophila naturally-infected with two different types of Spiroplasma. For naturally infected Drosophila species we found that non-male-killing infections had consistently lower densities than the male-killing infection. The patterns of Spiroplasma titer change during aging varied among Drosophila species infected with different Spiroplasma strains. Bacterial density varied within and among populations of Drosophila, with individuals from the population with the highest prevalence of infection having the highest density. This density variation underscores the complex interaction of Spiroplasma strain and host genetic background in determining endosymbiont density. ","195":"Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism to elucidate basic cellular mechanisms of development. Indeed, much of our understanding of genetic pathways comes from work in Drosophila. However, mutations in many critical genes cause early embryonic lethality; thus, it is difficult to study the role of proteins that are required for early fundamental processes during later embryonic stages. We have therefore developed a method to reversibly deliver drugs to internal tissues of stage 15-16 Drosophila embryos using a 1:1 combination of D-limonene and heptane (LH). Specifically, delivery of Nocodazole was shown to be effective as evidenced by the significant decrease in microtubule density seen in muscle cells. Following complete depolymerization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, removing the Nocodazole and washing for 10 min was sufficient for the microtubule network to be re-established, indicating that drug delivery is reversible. Additionally, the morphology of LH-treated embryos resembled that of untreated controls, and embryo viability post-treatment with LH was significantly increased compared with previously reported permeabilization techniques. These advances in embryo permeabilization provide a means to disrupt protein function in vivo with high temporally specificity, bypassing the complications associated with genetic disruptions as they relate to the study of late-stage developmental mechanisms. ","196":"The generation of neuronal cell diversity is controlled by interdependent mechanisms, including cell intrinsic programs and environmental cues. During development, the astonishing variety of neurons is originated according to a precise timetable that is managed by a complex network of genes specifying individual types of neurons. Different neurons express specific sets of transcription factors, and they can be recognized by morphological characteristics and spatial localization, but, most importantly, they connect to each other and form functional units in a stereotyped fashion. This connectivity depends, mostly, on selective cell adhesion that is strictly regulated. While intrinsic factors specifying neuronal temporal identity have been extensively studied, an extrinsic temporal factor controlling neuronal temporal identity switch has not been shown. Our data demonstrate that pulses of steroid hormone act as a temporal cue to fine-tune neuronal cell differentiation. Here we also provide evidence that extrinsic JAK\/STAT cytokine signaling acts as a spatial code in the process. Particularly, in Drosophila mushroom bodies, neuronal identity transition is controlled by steroid-dependent microRNAs that regulate spatially distributed cytokine-dependent signaling factors that in turn modulate cell adhesion. A new era of neuronal plasticity assessment via managing external temporal cues such as hormones and cytokines that specify individual types of neurons might open new possibilities for brain regenerative therapeutics. ","197":"The TOR signaling pathway is crucial in the translation of nutritional inputs into the protein synthesis machinery regulation, allowing animal growth. We recently identified the Bud32 (yeast)\/PRPK (human) ortholog in Drosophila, Prpk (p53-related protein kinase), and found that it is required for TOR kinase activity. Bud32\/PRPK is an ancient and atypical kinase conserved in evolution from Archeae to humans, being essential for Archeae. It has been linked with p53 stabilization in human cell culture and its absence in yeast causes a slow-growth phenotype. This protein has been associated to KEOPS (kinase, putative endopeptidase and other proteins of small size) complex together with Kae1p (ATPase), Cgi-121 and Pcc1p. This complex has been implicated in telomere maintenance, transcriptional regulation, bud site selection and chemical modification of tRNAs (tRNAs). Bud32p and Kae1p have been related with N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t (6)A) synthesis, a particular chemical modification that occurs at position 37 of tRNAs that pair A-starting codons, required for proper translation in most species. Lack of this modification causes mistranslations and open reading frame shifts in yeast. The core constituents of the KEOPS complex are present in Drosophila, but their physical interaction has not been reported yet. Here, we present a review of the findings regarding the function of this complex in different organisms and new evidence that extends our recent observations of Prpk function in animal growth showing that depletion of Kae1 or Prpk, in accordance with their role in translation in yeast, is able to induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) in Drosophila. We suggest that EKC\/KEOPS complex could be integrating t (6)A-modified tRNA availability with translational rates, which are ultimately reflected in animal growth. ","198":"We have developed a novel model system in Drosophila melanogaster to study chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity in adult flies. Neurological deficits were measured using a manual geotactic climbing assay. The manual assay is commonly used; however, it is laborious, time-consuming, subject to human error and limited to observing one sample at a time. We have designed and built a new automated fly-counting apparatus that uses a \"video capture-particle counting technology\" to automatically measure 10 samples at a time, with 20 flies per sample. Climbing behavior was assessed manually, as in our previous studies, and with the automated apparatus within the same experiment yielding statistically similar results. Both climbing endpoints as well as the climbing rate can be measured in the apparatus, giving the assay more versatility than the manual assay. Automation of our climbing assay reduces variability, increases productivity and enables high throughput drug screens for neurotoxicity. ","199":"L-glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter at excitatory synapses in the vertebrate CNS and at arthropod neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger the recruitment of glutamate receptors at the onset of synaptogenesis and promote their stabilization at postsynaptic densities remain poorly understood. We have reported the discovery of a novel, evolutionary conserved molecule, Neto, essential for clustering of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) at Drosophila NMJ. Neto is the first auxiliary subunit described in Drosophila and is the only non-channel subunit absolutely required for functional iGluRs. Here we review the role of Drosophila Neto in synapse assembly, its similarities with other Neto proteins and a new perspective on how glutamatergic synapses are physically assembled and stabilized. ","200":"Appropriate gene expression relies on the sophisticated interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors. Histone acetylation and an open chromatin configuration are key features of transcribed regions and are mainly present around active promoters. Our recent identification of the SET-domain containing protein UpSET established a new functional link between the modulation of open chromatin features and active recruitment of well-known co-repressors in metazoans. Structurally, the SET domain of UpSET resembles H3K4 and H3K36 methyltransferases; however, it is does not confer histone methyltransferase activity. Rather than methylating histones to regulate gene expression like other SET domain-containing proteins, UpSET fine-tunes transcription by modulating the chromatin structure around active promoters resulting in suppression of expression of off-target genes or nearby repetitive elements. Chromatin modulation by UpSET occurs in part through its interaction with histone deacetylases. Here, we discuss the different scenarios in which UpSET could play key roles in modulating gene expression. ","201":"Theoretical considerations predict that balancer chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster should accumulate numerous deleterious mutations with time. We counted the number of recessive lethal mutations on two balancer chromosomes from the In(2LR)SM1\/In(2LR)Pm strain maintained in our lab, after making the balancers heterozygous with deficiencies from second-chromosome Kyoto Deficiency kit strains. We detected 10 recessive lethal mutations in the balancer In(2LR)Pm, which is consistent with the mutation rate estimated previously. However, we detected only three mutations, a significantly smaller number, in the balancer In(2LR)SM1, although this may be an artifact. In conclusion, we observed genetic decay over an estimable timescale by using balancers with historical records. Thus, balancers of any strain may have accumulated many unidentified recessive lethal mutations. ","202":"Study of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has yielded important insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. Courtship conditioning is a well-established behavioral assay used to study Drosophila learning and memory. Here, we describe the development of software to analyze courtship suppression assay data that correctly identifies normal or abnormal learning and memory traits of individual flies. Development of this automated analysis software will significantly enhance our ability to use this assay in large-scale genetic screens and disease modeling. The software increases the consistency, objectivity, and types of data generated. ","203":"The development of genomic resources in non-model taxa is essential for understanding the genetic basis of biological diversity. Although the genomes of many Drosophila species have been sequenced, most of the phenotypic diversity in this genus remains to be explored. To facilitate the genetic analysis of interspecific and intraspecific variation, we have generated new genomic resources for seven species and subspecies in the D. ananassae species subgroup. We have generated large amounts of transcriptome sequence data for D. ercepeae, D. merina, D. bipectinata, D. malerkotliana malerkotliana, D. m. pallens, D. pseudoananassae pseudoananassae, and D. p. nigrens. de novo assembly resulted in contigs covering more than half of the predicted transcriptome and matching an average of 59% of annotated genes in the complete genome of D. ananassae. Most contigs, corresponding to an average of 49% of D. ananassae genes, contain sequence polymorphisms that can be used as genetic markers. Subsets of these markers were validated by genotyping the progeny of inter- and intraspecific crosses. The ananassae subgroup is an excellent model system for examining the molecular basis of speciation and phenotypic evolution. The new genomic resources will facilitate the genetic analysis of inter- and intraspecific differences in this lineage. Transcriptome sequencing provides a simple and cost-effective way to identify molecular markers at nearly single-gene density, and is equally applicable to any non-model taxa.","204":"Previous studies addressing the relationship between gene regulation and inbreeding depression did not allow for discerning the changes that alleviate the depression from those that generate it. We directly addressed this question by analyzing changes in gene expression, using Affymetrix 2.0 arrays in Drosophila melanogaster inbred sublines differing in their magnitudes of inbreeding depression relative to the expression in an outbred control. The total number of arrays analyzed was 27, with 9,133 probe sets showing a significant signal of expression. We found that for those genes differentially expressed between inbred and outbred sublines, most of them showed a pattern of expression consistent with a protective role against inbreeding effects. The observed increase in depression was presumably related to an inability of the genome to do the appropriate expression adjustments. Expression changes detected in our study showed a clear specificity of RNA-splicing and energy derivation functions. Thus, it appears that most of the observed changes in gene expression associated with inbreeding may occur predominantly to alleviate inbreeding depression, i.e., as a protection against the effects of inbreeding.","205":"During metamorphosis in holometabolous insects, the nervous system undergoes dramatic remodeling as it transitions from its larval to its adult form. Many neurons are generated through post-embryonic neurogenesis to have adult-specific roles, but perhaps more striking is the dramatic remodeling that occurs to transition neurons from functioning in the larval to the adult nervous system. These neurons exhibit a remarkable degree of plasticity during this transition; many subsets undergo programmed cell death, others remodel their axonal and dendritic arbors extensively, whereas others undergo trans-differentiation to alter their terminal differentiation gene expression profiles. Yet other neurons appear to be developmentally frozen in an immature state throughout larval life, to be awakened at metamorphosis by a process we term temporally-tuned differentiation. These multiple forms of remodeling arise from subtype-specific responses to a single metamorphic trigger, ecdysone. Here, we discuss recent progress in Drosophila melanogaster that is shedding light on how subtype-specific programs of neuronal remodeling are generated during metamorphosis. ","206":"The mechanism by which inhaled anesthetics work is not fully understood, although they have been extensively used. Much research has been done showing the likelihood that there is more than one pathway or mechanism of action. A long-term goal of our laboratory is to decipher these mechanisms using Drosophila melanogaster, an excellent model organism for this purpose. In order to do this, we have modified and constructed an apparatus called the inebriometer to quantitatively analyze the response of flies to inhaled anesthetics. While the inebriometer is not new to the fly community, our updated design provides a relatively low-labor, high-throughput means for performing screens in search of genes involved in the anesthetic mechanism. Here we describe our construction of an airtight inebriometer that we have designed for this purpose. We also provide data that validates this apparatus and establishes a procedure for its use. ","207":"In this study we have taken advantage of recent whole genome sequencing studies that have determined the DNA content in the heterochromatic regions of each Drosophila chromosome to directly correlate the effect on position-effect variegation of a pericentric insertion reporter line, 118E-10 with the total amount of heterochromatic DNA. Heterochromatic DNA levels were manipulated by adding or subtracting a Y chromosome as well as by the difference in the amount of pericentric heterochromatin between the X and Y chromosome. The results showed a direct, linear relationship between the amount of heterochromatic DNA in the genome and the expression of the w marker gene in the 118E-10 pericentric reporter line and that increasing amounts of heterochromatic DNA resulted in increasing amounts of pigment\/gene activity. In Drosophila heterochromatic spreading and gene silencing is counteracted by H3S10 phosphorylation by the JIL-1 kinase, and we further demonstrate that the haplo-enhancer effect of JIL-1 is proportional to the amount of total heterochomatin, suggesting that JIL-1's activity is dynamically modulated to achieve a more or less constant balance depending on the levels of heterochromatic factors present. ","208":null,"209":"Sleep disturbances are common in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Unfortunately, how AD is mechanistically linked with interference of the body's natural sleep rhythms remains unclear. Our recent findings provide insight into this question by demonstrating that sleep disruption associated with AD is driven by epigenetic changes mediated by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Tip60. In this study, we show that Tip60 functionally interacts with the AD associated amyloid precursor protein (APP) to regulate axonal growth of Drosophila small ventrolateral neuronal (sLNv) pacemaker cells, and their production of neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF) that stabilizes appropriate sleep-wake patterns in the fly. Loss of Tip60 HAT activity under APP neurodegenerative conditions causes decreased PDF production, retraction of the sLNv synaptic arbor required for PDF release and disruption of sleep-wake cycles in these flies. Remarkably, excess Tip60 in conjunction with APP fully rescues these sleep-wake disturbances by inducing overelaboration of the sLNv synaptic terminals and increasing PDF levels, supporting a neuroprotective role for Tip60 in these processes. Our studies highlight the importance of epigenetic based mechanisms underlying sleep disturbances in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. ","210":"Heterochromatin is the enigmatic eukaryotic genome compartment found mostly at telomeres and centromeres. Conventional approaches to sequence assembly and genetic manipulation fail in this highly repetitive, gene-sparse, and recombinationally silent DNA. In contrast, genetic and molecular analyses of euchromatin-encoded proteins that bind, remodel, and propagate heterochromatin have revealed its vital role in numerous cellular and evolutionary processes. Utilizing the 12 sequenced Drosophila genomes, Levine et al (1) took a phylogenomic approach to discover new such protein \"surrogates\" of heterochromatin function and evolution. This paper reported over 20 new members of what was traditionally believed to be a small and static Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) gene family. The newly identified HP1 proteins are structurally diverse, lineage-restricted, and expressed primarily in the male germline. The birth and death of HP1 genes follows a \"revolving door\" pattern, where new HP1s appear to replace old HP1s. Here, we address alternative evolutionary models that drive this constant innovation. ","211":"Drosophila Smaug is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that can repress the translation and induce the degradation of target mRNAs in the early Drosophila embryo. Our recent work has uncovered a new mechanism of Smaug-mediated translational repression whereby it interacts with and recruits the Argonaute 1 (Ago1) protein to an mRNA. Argonaute proteins are typically recruited to mRNAs through an associated small RNA, such as a microRNA (miRNA). Surprisingly, we found that Smaug is able to recruit Ago1 to an mRNA in a miRNA-independent manner. This work suggests that other RNA-binding proteins are likely to employ a similar mechanism of miRNA-independent Ago recruitment to control mRNA expression. Our work also adds yet another mechanism to the list that Smaug can use to regulate its targets and here we discuss some of the issues that are raised by Smaug's multi-functional nature. ","212":"In Drosophila melanogaster, the fruitless (fru) gene encoding BTB-Zn-finger transcription factors organizes male sexual behavior by controlling the development of sexually dimorphic neuronal circuitry. However, the molecular mechanism by which fru controls the sexual fate of neurons has been unknown. Our recent study represents a first step toward clarification of this mechanism. We have shown that: (1) Fru forms a complex with the transcriptional cofactor Bonus (Bon), which recruits either of two chromatin regulators, Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) or Heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a), to Fru-target sites; (2) the Fru-Bon complex has a masculinizing effect on single sexually-dimorphic neurons when it recruits HDAC1, whereas it has a demasculinizing effect when it recruits HP1a; (3) HDAC1 or HP1a thus recruited to Fru-target sites determines the sexual fate of single neurons in an all-or-none manner, as manipulations of HDAC1 or HP1a expression levels affect the proportion of male-typical neurons and female-typical neurons without producing neurons of intersexual characteristics. Here, we hypothesize that chromatin landscape changes induced by ecdysone surges direct the HDAC1- or HP1a-containing Fru complex to distinct targets, thereby allowing them to switch the neuronal sexual fate in the brain. ","213":"What are the sources of phenotypic variation and which factors shape this variation are fundamental questions of developmental and evolutionary biology. Despite this simple formulation and intense research, controversy remains. Three points are particularly discussed: (1) whether adaptive developmental mechanisms buffering variation exist at all; (2) if yes, do they involve specific genes and processes, i.e., different from those involved in the development of the traits that are buffered?; and (3) whether different mechanisms specifically buffer the various sources of variation, i.e., genetic, environmental and stochastic, or whether a generalist process buffers them all at once. We advocate that experimental work integrating different levels of analysis will improve our understanding of the origin of phenotypic variation and thus help answering these contentious questions. In this paper, we first survey the current views on these issues, highlighting potential sources of controversy. We then focus on the stochastic part of phenotypic variation, as measured by fluctuating asymmetry, and on current knowledge about the genetic basis of developmental stability. We report our recent discovery that an individual gene, Cyclin G, plays a central role-adaptive or not-in developmental stability in Drosophila. ( 1) We discuss the implications of this discovery on the regulation of organ size and shape, and finally point out open questions. ","214":"Reporter gene activity in enhancer trap lines is often implicitly assumed to mirror quite faithfully the endogenous expression of the \"trapped\" gene, even though there are numerous examples of enhancer trap infidelity. optomotor-blind (omb) is a 160 kb gene in which 16 independent P-element enhancer trap insertions of three different types have been mapped in a range of more than 60 kb. We have determined the expression pattern of these elements in wing, eye-antennal and leg imaginal discs as well as in the pupal tergites. We noted that one pGawB insertion (omb (P4) ) selectively failed to report parts of the omb pattern even though the missing pattern elements were apparent in all other 15 lines. We ruled out that omb (P4) was defective in the Gal4 promoter region or had inactivated genomic enhancers in the integration process. We propose that the Gal4 reporter gene in pGawB may be sensitive to orientation or promoter proximity effects. ","215":"The D. flavopilosa group encompasses an ecologically restricted set of species strictly adapted to hosting flowers of Cestrum (Solanaceae). This group presents potential to be used as a model to the study of different questions regarding ecologically restricted species macro and microevolutionary responses, geographical vs. ecological speciation and intra and interspecific competition. This review aims to revisit and reanalyze the patterns and processes that are subjacent to the interesting ecological and evolutionary properties of these species. Biotic and abiotic niche properties of some species were reanalyzed in face of ecological niche modeling approaches in order to get some insights into their ecological evolution. A test of the potential of DNA-Barcoding provided evidences that this technology may be a way of overcoming difficulties related to cryptic species differentiation. The new focus replenishes the scenario with new questions, presenting a case where neither geographical nor ecological speciation may be as yet suggested. ","216":"Although the neurophysiological correlates of sleep have been thoroughly described, genetic mechanisms that control sleep architecture, long surmised from ethological studies, family histories and clinical observations, have only been investigated during the past decade. Key contributions to the molecular understanding of sleep have come from studies in Drosophila, benefitting from a strong history of circadian rhythm research. For instance, a number of recent papers have highlighted the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-3 in the regulation of circadian rhythm and sleep. We propose that different Cullin-3 substrate adaptors may affect specific molecular pathways and diverse aspects of circadian rhythm and sleep. We have previously shown that mutations in BTBD9, a risk factor for Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) encoding a Cullin-3 substrate adaptor, lead to reduced dopamine, increased locomotion and sleep fragmentation. Here, we propose that Cullin-3 acts together with BTBD9 to limit the accumulation of iron regulatory proteins in conditions of iron deficiency. Our model is consistent with clinical observations implicating iron homeostasis in the pathophysiology of RLS and predicts that lack of BTBD9 leads to misregulation of cellular iron storage, inactivating the critical biosynthetic enzyme Tyrosine Hydroxylase in dopaminergic neurons, with consequent phenotypic effects on sleep.","217":"Bateman's experimental study of Drosophila melanogaster produced conclusions that are now part of the bedrock premises of modern sexual selection. Today it is the most cited experimental study in sexual selection, and famous as the first experimental demonstration of sex differences in the relationship between number of mates and relative reproductive success. We repeated the experimental methodology of the original to evaluate its reliability. The results indicate that Bateman's methodology of visible mutations to assign parentage and reproductive success to subject adults is significantly biased. When combined in offspring, the mutations decrease offspring survival, so that counts of mate number and reproductive success are mismeasured. Bateman's method overestimates the number of subjects with no mates and underestimates the number with one or more mates for both sexes. Here we discuss why Bateman's paper is important and present additional analyses of data from our monogamy trials. Monogamy trials can inform inferences about the force of sexual selection in populations because in monogamy trials male-male competition and female choice are absent. Monogamy trials also would have provided Bateman with an a priori test of the fit of his data to Mendel's laws, an unstated, but vital assumption of his methodology for assigning parentage from which he inferred the number of mates per individual subject and their reproductive success. Even under enforced monogamous mating, offspring frequencies of double mutant, single mutant and no mutant offspring were significantly different from Mendelian expectations proving that Bateman's method was inappropriate for answering the questions he posed. Double mutant offspring (those with a mutation from each parent) suffered significant inviability as did single mutant offspring whenever they inherited their mother's marker but the wild-type allele at their father's marker locus. These inviability effects produced two important inaccuracies in Bateman's results and conclusions. (1) Some matings that actually occurred were invisible and (2) reproductive success of some mothers was under-estimated. Both observations show that Bateman's conclusions about sex differences in number of mates and reproductive success were unwarranted, based on biased observations. We speculate about why Bateman's classic study remained without replication for so long, and we discuss why repetition almost 60 years after the original is still timely, necessary and critical to the scientific enterprise. We highlight overlooked alternative hypotheses to urge that modern tests of Bateman's conclusions go beyond confirmatory studies to test alternative hypotheses to explain the relationship between mate number and reproductive success.","218":"When obtaining samples for population genetic studies, it is essential that the sampling is random. For Drosophila, one of the crucial steps in sampling experimental flies is the collection of eggs. Here an egg collection method is presented, which randomizes the eggs in a water column and diminishes environmental variance. This method was compared with a traditional egg collection method where eggs are collected directly from the medium. Within each method the observed and expected standard deviations of egg-to-adult viability were compared, whereby the difference in the randomness of the samples between the two methods was assessed. The method presented here was superior to the traditional method. Only 14% of the samples had a standard deviation higher than expected, as compared with 58% in the traditional method. To reduce bias in the estimation of the variance and the mean of a trait and to obtain a representative collection of genotypes, the method presented here is strongly recommended when collecting eggs from Drosophila.","219":"DNA integrity is under the control of multiple pathways of nucleotide metabolism and DNA damage recognition and repair. Unusual sets of protein factors involved in these control mechanisms may result in tolerance and accumulation of non-canonical bases within the DNA. We investigate the presence of uracil in genomic DNA of Drosophila melanogaster. Results indicate a developmental pattern and strong correlations between uracil-DNA levels, dUTPase expression and developmental fate of different tissues. The intriguing lack of the catalytically most efficient uracil-DNA glycosylase in Drosophila melanogaster may be a general attribute of Holometabola and is suggested to be involved in the specific characteristics of uracil-DNA metabolism in these insects.","220":"Thirteen drosophilid species belonging to seven genera and two subfamilies are reported from three coral islands (namely Europa, Juan de Nova and Glorioso) that belong to the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean. Five species are cosmopolitan and five are African. Three are endemic to the insular Western Indian Ocean, including a presumably new Scaptodrosophila species. On the island of Juan de Nova, most captured flies had pollinia attached to the bases of their proboscis. DNA analysis using the rbcl gene revealed that these pollinia belong to the genus Leptadenia (Apocynaceae), of which a single species L. madagascariensis, endemic in Madagascar and Comoros, is present in this island. This is the first reported association between this plant and drosophilids.","221":"Proteins perform essential cellular functions as part of protein complexes, often in conjunction with RNA, DNA, metabolites and other small molecules. The genome encodes thousands of proteins but not all of them are expressed in every cell type; and expressed proteins are not active at all times. Such diversity of protein expression and function accounts for the level of biological intricacy seen in nature. Defining protein-protein interactions in protein complexes, and establishing the when, what and where of potential interactions, is therefore crucial to understanding the cellular function of any protein-especially those that have not been well studied by traditional molecular genetic approaches. We generated a large-scale resource of affinity-tagged expression-ready clones and used co-affinity purification combined with tandem mass-spectrometry to identify protein partners of nearly 5,000 Drosophila melanogaster proteins. The resulting protein complex \"map\" provided a blueprint of metazoan protein complex organization. Here we describe how the map has provided valuable insights into protein function in addition to generating hundreds of testable hypotheses. We also discuss recent technological advancements that will be critical in addressing the next generation of questions arising from the map.","222":"Hox proteins are a prominent class of transcription factors that specify cell and tissue identities in animal embryos. In sharp contrast to tissue-specifically expressed transcription factors, which coordinate regulatory pathways leading to the differentiation of a selected tissue, Hox proteins are active in many different cell types but are nonetheless able to differentially regulate gene expression in a context-dependent manner. This particular feature makes Hox proteins ideal candidates for elucidating the mechanisms employed by transcription factors to achieve tissue-specific functions in multi-cellular organisms. Here we discuss how the recent genome-wide identification and characterization of Hox cis-regulatory elements has provided insight concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying the high spatiotemporal specificity of Hox proteins. In particular, it was shown that Hox transcriptional outputs depend on the cell-type specific interplay of the different Hox proteins with co-regulatory factors as well as with epigenetic modifiers. Based on these observations it becomes clear that cell-type specific approaches are required for dissecting the tissue-specific Hox regulatory code. Identification and comparative analysis of Hox cis-regulatory elements driving target gene expression in different cell types in combination with analyses on how cofactors, epigenetic modifiers and protein-protein interactions mediate context-dependent Hox function will elucidate the mechanistic basis of tissue-specific gene regulation.","223":"Lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) are a class of enzymes that can dephosphorylate a number of lysophopholipids in vitro. Analysis of knockouts of LPP family members has demonstrated striking but diverse developmental roles for these enzymes. LPP3 is required for mouse vascular development while the Drosophila LPPs Wunen (Wun) and Wunen2 (Wun2) are required during embryogenesis for germ cell migration and survival. In a recent publication we examined if these fly LPPs have further developmental roles and found that Wun is required for proper tracheal formation. In particular we highlight a role for Wun in septate junction mediated barrier function in the tracheal system. In this paper we discuss further the possible mechanisms by which LPPs may influence barrier activity.","224":"The Drosophila Sex-lethal (Sxl) gene encodes a female-specific RNA binding protein that in somatic cells globally regulates all aspects of female-specific development and behavior. Sxl also has a critical, but less well understood, role in female germ cells. Germ cells without Sxl protein can adopt a stem cell fate when housed in a normal ovary, but fail to successfully execute the self-renewal differentiation fate switch. The failure to differentiate is accompanied by the inappropriate expression of a set of male specific markers, continued proliferation, and formation of a tumor. The findings in Chau et al., (2012) identify the germline stem cell maintenance factor nanos as one of its target genes, and suggest that Sxl enables the switch from germline stem cell to committed daughter cell by posttranscriptional downregulation of nanos expression. These studies provide the basis for a new model in which Sxl directly couples sexual identity with the self-renewal differentiation decision and raises several interesting questions about the genesis of the tumor phenotype.","225":"When a new student first begins to push flies, an immediate skill that must be learned is sorting the sexes. In Drosophila melanogaster several sexually dimorphic characters can be used to readily distinguish males from females including abdominal pigmentation, male sex combs and genital morphology. Another, often-overlooked, sexual dimorphism is adult abdominal segment number. Externally, adult Drosophila males possess one fewer abdominal segment than females; the terminal pre-genital segment apparently either absent or fused with the next-most anterior segment. Beyond known roles for the homeotic protein Abdominal-B (Abd-B) and the sex-determining transcription factor Doublesex (Dsx) as key regulators of this trait, surprisingly little is known about either the morphogenetic processes or the downstream genetics responsible for patterning these events. We have explored both and found that rapid epithelial reorganization during pupation eliminates a nascent terminal male segment. We found this Abd-B-dependent process results from sex- and segment-specific regulation of diverse developmental targets including the wingless gene and surprisingly, dsx itself. ( 1)  (,)  ( 2)  Here, I review our observations and discuss this trait as a model to explore both dynamics of epithelial morphogenesis as well as the evolution of developmental mechanisms.","226":"Hematopoiesis is well-conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates. Similar as in vertebrates, the sites of hematopoiesis shift during Drosophila development. Blood cells (hemocytes) originate de novo during hematopoietic waves in the embryo and in the Drosophila lymph gland. In contrast, the hematopoietic wave in the larva is based on the colonization of resident hematopoietic sites by differentiated hemocytes that arise in the embryo, much like in vertebrates the colonization of peripheral tissues by primitive macrophages of the yolk sac, or the seeding of fetal liver, spleen and bone marrow by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. At the transition to the larval stage, Drosophila embryonic hemocytes retreat to hematopoietic \"niches,\" i.e., segmentally repeated hematopoietic pockets of the larval body wall that are jointly shared with sensory neurons and other cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Hemocytes rely on the PNS for their localization and survival, and are induced to proliferate in these microenvironments, expanding to form the larval hematopoietic system. In this process, differentiated hemocytes from the embryo resume proliferation and self-renew, omitting the need for an undifferentiated prohemocyte progenitor. Larval hematopoiesis is the first Drosophila model for blood cell colonization and niche support by the PNS. It suggests an interface where innocuous or noxious sensory inputs regulate blood cell homeostasis or immune responses. The system adds to the growing concept of nervous system dependence of hematopoietic microenvironments and organ stem cell niches, which is being uncovered across phyla.","227":"Drosophila melanogaster is widely used as a model system for development and disease. Due to the homology between Drosophila and human genes, as well as the tractable genetics of the fly, its use as a model for neurologic disorders, in particular, has been rising. Locomotive impairment is a commonly used diagnostic for screening and characterization of these models, yet a fast, sensitive and model-free method to compare behavior is lacking. Here, we present a high throughput method to quantify the crawling behavior of larvae. We use the mean squared displacement as well as the direction autocorrelation of the crawling larvae as descriptors of their motion. By tracking larvae from wild-type strains and models of the Fragile X mental retardation as well as Alzheimer disease, we show these mutants exhibit impaired crawling. We further show that the magnitude of impairment correlates with the severity of the mutation, demonstrating the sensitivity and the dynamic range of the method. Finally, we study larvae with altered expression of the shaggy gene, a homolog of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3), which has been implicated in Alzheimer disease. Surprisingly, we find that both increased and decreased expression of dGSK-3 lead to similar larval crawling impairment. These findings have implications for the use of GSK-3 inhibitors recently proposed for Alzheimer treatment.","228":"As tissues and organs are formed, they acquire a specific shape that plays an integral role in their ability to function properly. A relatively simple system that has been used to examine how tissues and organs are shaped is the formation of an elongated Drosophila egg. While it has been known for some time that Drosophila egg elongation requires interactions between a polarized intracellular basal actin network and a polarized extracellular network of basal lamina proteins, how these interactions contribute to egg elongation remained unclear. Recent studies using live imaging have revealed two novel processes, global tissue rotation and oscillating basal actomyosin contractions, which have provided significant insight into how the two polarized protein networks cooperate to produce an elongated egg. This review summarizes the proteins involved in Drosophila egg elongation and how this recent work has contributed to our current understanding of how egg elongation is achieved.","229":"Spermatogenesis in all animal species occurs within a syncytium. Only at the very end of spermatogenesis are individual sperm cells resolved from this syncytium in a process known as individualization. Individualization in Drosophila begins as a membrane-cytoskeletal complex known as the individualization complex (IC) assembles around the sperm heads and proceeds down the flagella, removing cytoplasm from between the sperm tails and shrink-wrapping each spermatid into its own plasma membrane as it travels. The mulet (mlt) mutation results in severely disrupted ICs, indicating that the mlt gene product is required for individualization. Inverse PCR followed by cycle sequencing maps all known P-insertion alleles of mlt to two overlapping genes, CG12214 (the Drosophila tubulin-binding cofactor E-like homolog) and KCNQ (a large voltage-gated potassium channel). However, since the alleles of mlt map to the 5'-UTR of CG12214 and since CG12214 is contained within an intron of KCNQ, it was hypothesized that mlt and CG12214 are allelic. Indeed, CG12214 mutant testes exhibited severely disrupted ICs and were indistinguishable from mlt mutant testes, thus further suggesting allelism. To test this hypothesis, alleles of mlt were crossed to CG12214 in order to generate trans-heterozygous males. Testes from all trans-heterozygous combinations revealed severely disrupted ICs and were also indistinguishable from mlt mutant testes, indicating that mlt and CG12214 fail to complement one another and are thus allelic. In addition, complementation testing against null alleles of KCNQ verified that the observed individualization defect is not caused by a disruption of KCNQ. Finally, since a population of spermatid-associated microtubules known to disappear prior to movement of the IC abnormally persists during individualization in CG12214 mutant testes, this work implicates TBCE-like in the removal of these microtubules prior to IC movement. Taken together, these results identify mlt as CG12214 and suggest that the removal of microtubules by TBCE-like is a necessary pre-requisite for proper coordinated movement of the IC.","230":"Neuropeptides are ubiquitous in both mammals and invertebrates and play essential roles in regulation and modulation of many developmental and physiological processes through activation of G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs). However, the mechanisms by which many of the neuropeptides regulate specific neural function and behaviors remain undefined. Here we investigate the functions of Drosulfakinin (DSK), the Drosophila homolog of vertebrate neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK), which is the most abundant neuropeptide in the central nervous system. We provide biochemical evidence that sulfated DSK-1 and DSK-2 activate the CCKLR-17D1 receptor in a cell culture assay. We further examine the role of DSK and CCKLR-17D1 in the regulation of larval locomotion, both in a semi-intact larval preparation and in intact larvae under intense light exposure. Our results suggest that DSK\/CCKLR-17D1 signaling promote larval body wall muscle contraction and is necessary for mediating locomotor behavior in stress-induced escape response.","231":"The vinegar flies Drosophila subobscura and D. obscura frequently serve as study organisms for evolutionary biology. Their high morphological similarity renders traditional species determination difficult, especially when living specimens for setting up laboratory populations need to be identified. Here we test the usefulness of cuticular chemical profiles collected via the non-invasive method near-infrared spectroscopy for discriminating live individuals of the two species. We find a classification success for wild-caught specimens of 85%. The species specificity of the chemical profiles persists in laboratory offspring (87-92% success). Thus, we conclude that the cuticular chemistry is genetically determined, despite changes in the cuticular fingerprints, which we interpret as due to laboratory adaptation, genetic drift and\/or diet changes. However, because of these changes, laboratory-reared specimens should not be used to predict the species-membership of wild-caught individuals, and vice versa. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying an appropriate cut-off value for interpreting the prediction values, the classification success can be immensely improved (to up to 99%), albeit at the cost of excluding a considerable portion of specimens from identification.","232":"Wolbachia is a genus of parasitic alphaproteobacteria found in arthropods and nematodes, and represents on of the most common, widespread endosymbionts known. Wolbachia affects a variety of reproductive functions in its host (e.g., male killing, cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis), which have the potential to dramatically impact host evolution and species formation. Here, we present the first broad-scale study to screen natural populations of native Hawaiian insects for Wolbachia, focusing on the endemic Diptera. Results indicate that Wolbachia infects native Hawaiian taxa, with alleles spanning phylogenetic supergroups, A and B. The overall frequency of Wolbachia incidene in Hawaiian insects was 14%. The incidence of infection in native Hawaiian Diptera was 11% for individuals and 12% for all species screened. Wolbachia was not detected in two large, widespread Hawaiian dipteran families-Dolichopodidae (44 spp screened) and Limoniidae (12 spp screened). Incidence of infection within endemic Hawaiian lineages that carry Wolbachia was 18% in Drosophilidae species, 25% in Caliphoridae species, &gt; 90% in Nesophrosyne species, 20% in Drosophila dasycnemia and 100% in Nesophrosyne craterigena. Twenty unique alleles were recovered in this study, of which 18 are newly recorded. Screening of endemic populations of D. dasycnemia across Hawaii Island revealed 4 unique alleles. Phylogenetic relationships and allele diversity provide evidence for horizontal transfer of Wolbachia among Hawaiian arthropod lineages.","233":"Dorsoventral (DV) axis formation in Drosophila begins during oogenesis through the graded activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR)-Ras-MAPK signaling pathway in the follicle cell layer of the egg chamber. EGFR signaling, which is higher in dorsal follicle cells, represses expression of the sulfotransferase-encoding gene pipe, thereby delimiting a ventral domain of Pipe activity that is critical for the subsequent induction of ventral embryonic fates. We have characterized the transcriptional circuit that links EGFR signaling to pipe repression: in dorsal follicle cells, the homeodomain transcription factor Mirror (Mirr), which is induced by EGFR signaling, directly represses pipe transcription, whereas in ventral follicle cells, the HMG-box protein Capicua (Cic) supports pipe expression by repressing mirr. Although Cic is under negative post-transcriptional regulation by Ras-MAPK signaling in different contexts, the relevance of this mechanism for the interpretation of the EGFR signal during DV pattern formation remains unclear. Here, we consider a model where EGFR-mediated downregulation of Cic modulates the spatial distribution of Mirr protein in lateral follicle cells, thereby contributing to define the position at which the pipe expression border is formed.","234":"The Drosophila R7 photoreceptor precursor is directed to its fate by signals from adjacent cells that activate its Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) and Notch (N) signaling pathways. Counter-intuitively, the N activity both promotes and inhibits the photoreceptor fate in the R7 precursor. We offer an evolutionary perspective for this in which earlier ommatidia had fewer photoreceptors and used N to inhibit the addition of any more. When additional photoreceptors were added by evolution, an RTK signal was used to overcome the N inhibition in these cells, and these new additions potently activated N in their neighboring cells, preventing them from also responding to the RTK signal. The R7 precursor also receives this block, and requires robust RTK activation for it to become a photoreceptor. This is achieved by N transcriptionally activating a new RTK, one that is potently activated in the R7 precursor and sufficing to overcome the N inhibition. The unusually high RTK signal in R7 requires additional transduction components not needed when the signal is mild; in R7 the small GTPases Ras and Rap are both required to transduce the signal, but in other photoreceptors Ras alone suffices.","235":"A fundamental phenotypic trait in Drosophila melanogaster is the speed of movement. Its quantification in response to environmental and experimental factors is highly useful for behavioral and neurological studies. Quantifying this behavioral characteristic in freely moving flies is difficult, and many current systems are limited to evaluating the speed of movement of one fly at a time or rely on expensive, time-consuming methods. Here, we present a novel signal processing method of quantifying the speed of multiple flies using a system with automatic behavior detection and analysis that we previously developed to quantify general activity. By evaluating the shape of the signal wave from recordings of a live and simulated single fly, a metric for speed of movement was found. The feasibility of using this metric to estimate the speed of movement in a population of flies was then confirmed by evaluating recordings taken from populations of flies maintained at two different temperatures. The results were consistent with those reported in the literature. This method provides an automated way of measuring speed of locomotion in a fly population, which will further quantify fly behavioral responses to the environment.","236":"In this Extra View, we highlight recent Drosophila research that has uncovered a new role for the innate immune response. The research indicates that, in addition to combating infection, the innate immune response promotes neurodegeneration. Our publication (Petersen et al., 2012) reveals a correlative relationship between the innate immune response and neurodegeneration in a model of the human disease Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). We also found that glial cells are responsible for the innate immune response in the A-T model, and work by others implicates glial cells in neurodegeneration. Additionally, publications by Chinchore et al. (2012) and Tan et al. (2008) reveal a causative role for the innate immune response in models of human retinal degenerative disorders and Alzheimer disease, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that activation of the innate immune response is a shared cause of neurodegeneration in different human diseases.","237":"Drosophila melanogaster is a robust model to investigate many biological problems. It is however prone to some infections, which may endanger fly stocks if left unchecked for. One such infection is caused by an obligate fungal intracellular parasite, Tubulinosema ratisbonensis, which can be found in laboratory stocks. Here, we identify and briefly characterize a T. ratisbonensis strain that was infesting our Drosophila cultures and that required intensive measures to contain and eradicate the infection. We describe the phenotypes of infested stocks. We also report PCR-based techniques that allow the detection of infested stocks with a high sensitivity. We have developed a high-throughput qPCR assay that allows the efficient parallel screening of a large number of potentially-infested stocks. We also have investigated several prophylactic measures to prevent the further contamination of stocks, namely UV-exposure, ethanol treatment, bleaching, and desiccation. Bleaching was found to kill all spores. Other treatments were less effective but were found to be sufficient to prevent further contamination of noninfested stocks. Two treatments were efficacious in curing infested stocks (1) bleaching of eggs and subsequent raising of the larvae in clean vials; (2) fumagillin treatment. These cures only work on stocks that have not become too weak to withstand the procedures.","238":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins were originally identified as negative regulators of HOX genes in Drosophila but have since emerged as a widely used transcriptional repression system that controls a variety of developmental processes in animals and plants. PcG proteins exist in multi-protein complexes that comprise specific chromatin-modifying enzymatic activities. Genome-wide binding studies in Drosophila and in mammalian cells revealed that these complexes co-localize at a large set of genes encoding developmental regulators. Recent analyses in Drosophila have begun to explore how the different chromatin-modifying activities of PcG protein complexes contribute to the repression of individual target genes. These studies suggest that monoubiquitination of histone H2A (H2Aub) by the PcG protein Sce is only essential for repression of a subset of PcG target genes but is not required for the Polycomb-mediated repression of other targets. Calypso\/dBap1, a major deubiquitinase for H2Aub is also critically needed for repression of a subset of PcG target genes. Here, we review our current understanding of the role of H2A monoubiquitination and deubiquitination in Polycomb repression in Drosophila. We discuss unresolved issues concerning the immunological detection of H2Aub and critically evaluate experiments that used Sce and Ring1B point mutants with impaired H2A ubiquitinase activity to study H2Aub-dependent and -independent functions of these proteins in transcriptional repression.","239":null,"240":"We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating ~356,660 candidate SNPs in ~117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of ~1\/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that ~15,842 SNPs are synonymous and ~4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N\/S ~0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory.","241":"The Drosophila lethal(2)denticleless (l(2)dtl) gene was originally reported as essential for embryogenesis and formation of the rows of tiny hairs on the larval ventral cuticle known as denticle belts. It is now well-established that l(2)dtl (also called cdt2) encodes a subunit of a Cullin 4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets a number of key cell cycle regulatory proteins, including p21, Cdt1, E2F1 and Set8, to prevent replication defects and maintain cell cycle control. To investigate the role of l(2)dtl\/cdt2 during development, we characterized existing l(2)dtl\/cdt2 mutants and generated new deletion alleles, using P-element excision mutagenesis. Surprisingly, homozygous l(2)dtl\/cdt2 mutant embryos developed beyond embryogenesis, had intact denticle belts, and lacked an observable embryonic replication defect. These mutants died during larval stages, affirming that loss of l(2)dtl\/cdt2 function is lethal. Our data show that L(2)dtl\/Cdt2 is maternally deposited, remains nuclear throughout the cell cycle, and has a previously unreported, elevated expression in the developing gonads. We also find that E2f1 regulates l(2)dtl\/cdt2 expression during embryogenesis, possibly via several highly conserved putative E2f1 binding sites near the l(2)dtl\/cdt2 promoter. Finally, hypomorphic allele combinations of the l(2)dtl\/cdt2 gene result in a novel phenotype: viable, low-fertility males. We conclude that \"denticleless\" is a misnomer, but that l(2)dtl\/cdt2 is an essential gene for Drosophila development.","242":"Comparative genomics has identified regions of chromosomes susceptible to participate in rearrangements that modify gene order and genome architecture. Additionally, despite the high levels of genome rearrangement, unusually large regions that remain unaffected have also been uncovered. Functional constraints, such as long-range enhancers or local coregulation of neighboring genes, are thought to explain the maintenance of gene order (i.e., collinearity conservation) among distantly related species since the disruption of these protected regions would cause detrimental misregulation of gene expression. Local enrichment of certain genetic elements in regions of conserved collinearity has been used to support the existence of regulatory-based constraints, although the evidence is largely circumstantial. Indeed, a mechanism of chromosome evolution based only on the existence of fragile regions (i.e., those more susceptible to breaks) can also give rise to extended collinearity conservation, making it difficult to determine whether conserved gene organization is actually caused by functional constraints. Chromosome engineering coupled with genome wide expression profiling and phenotypic assays can provide unambiguous evidence for the presence of functional constraints acting on particular genomic regions. We have recently used this integrated approach to evaluate the presence and nature of putative constraints acting on one of the largest chromosomal regions conserved across nine species of Drosophila. We propose that regulatory-based constraints might not suffice to explain the maintenance of gene organization of some chromosome domains over evolutionary time.","243":"Research projects featuring repetitive phenotypic analysis of insects, such as taxonomic studies, quantitative genetics, and mutant screens, could be greatly facilitated by a simpler approach to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Here, we have applied low-vacuum SEM to wild type and mutant Drosophila and demonstrate that high quality ultrastructure data can be obtained quickly using minimal preparation. Adult flies, frozen live for storage, were mounted on aluminum stubs with carbon cement and directly imaged, with no chemical treatment or sputter coating. The key imaging parameters were identified and optimized, including chamber pressure, beam size, accelerating voltage, working distance and beam exposure. Different optimal conditions were found for eyes, wings, and bristles; in particular, surface features of bristles were obscured at higher accelerating voltages. The chief difficulties were charging, beam damage, and sample movement. We conclude that our optimized protocol is well suited to large-scale ultrastructural phenotypic analysis in insects.","244":"Individuals within species and populations vary. Such variation arises through environmental and genetic factors and ensures that no two individuals are identical. However, it is clear that not all traits show the same degree of intraspecific variation. Some traits, in particular secondary sexual characteristics used by males to compete for and attract females, are extremely variable among individuals in a population. Other traits, for example brain size in mammals, are not. Recent research has begun to explore the possibility that the extent of phenotypic variation (here referred to as \"variability\") may be a character itself and subject to natural selection. While these studies support the concept of variability as an evolvable trait, controversy remains over what precisely the trait is. At the heart of this controversy is the fact that there are very few examples of developmental mechanisms that regulate trait variability in response to any source of variation, be it environmental or genetic. Here, we describe a recent study from our laboratory that identifies such a mechanism. We then place the study in the context of current research on the regulation of trait variability, and discuss the implications for our understanding of the developmental regulation and evolution of phenotypic variation.","245":"The Drosophila embryonic salivary gland is a powerful system to analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tubulogenesis in vivo. The secretory portion of the salivary gland (referred to here as the salivary gland), is a pair of elongated epithelial tubes with a single central lumen, that is formed by the invagination and collective migration of gland cells from the ventral surface of the embryo. ( 1) (,) ( 2) As the salivary gland elongates during migration, the central lumen elongates and narrows at the proximal end. ( 3) A number of genes are known to regulate salivary gland migration and\/or lumen size (Table 1); however, it is only recently that we have begun to analyze how control of salivary gland migration is coordinated with control of lumen size. To understand coordinated control of salivary gland migration and lumen size, we analyzed the role of the single Drosophila Rho GTPase, Rho1, in salivary gland tubulogenesis. In addition to the requirement of Rho1 in salivary gland invagination and migration (Xu et al., 2008), our recent studies show that Rho1 controls salivary gland lumen width and length during the migration process (Fig. 1). These studies reveal that Rho1-mediated processes at the proximal end of the migrating salivary gland, such as cell shape change, cell rearrangement and apical domain elongation, contribute to collective migration, and narrowing and elongation of the lumen. ( 4).","246":"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential for proper tissue patterning and maintenance and has a substantial impact on human disease. While many of the main components and mechanisms involved in transduction of the Hh signal have been identified, the details of how the pathway functions are continually being refined. One aspect that has attracted much attention recently is the involvement of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) in the pathway. These regulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling have an evolutionarily-conserved function in promoting high-threshold Hh target gene expression through regulation of Smoothened (Smo), a GPCR family member that activates intracellular Hh signaling. Several models of how GRKs impact on Smo to increase downstream signaling have been proposed. Recently, we demonstrated that these kinases have surprisingly complex and conflicting roles, acting to limit signaling through the pathway while also promoting Smo activity. In addition to the previously described direct effects of Gprk2 on Smo activation, Gprk2 also indirectly affects Hh signaling by controlling production of the second messenger cyclic AMP to influence Protein kinase A activity.","247":"The JIL-1 kinase is a multidomain protein that localizes specifically to euchromatin interband regions of polytene chromosomes and is the kinase responsible for histone H3S10 phosphorylation at interphase. Genetic interaction assays have suggested that the function of the epigenetic histone H3S10ph mark is to antagonize heterochromatization by participating in a dynamic balance between factors promoting repression and activation of gene expression as measured by position-effect variegation (PEV) assays. Interestingly, JIL-1 loss-of-function alleles can act either as an enhancer or indirectly as a suppressor of w(m4) PEV depending on the precise levels of JIL-1 kinase activity. In this study, we have explored the relationship between PEV and the relative levels of the H3S10ph and H3K9me2 marks at the white gene in both wild-type and w(m4) backgrounds by ChIP analysis. Our results indicate that H3K9me2 levels at the white gene directly correlate with its level of expression and that H3K9me2 levels in turn are regulated by H3S10 phosphorylation.","248":"Genes occasionally change their location in the genome through inter-chromosomal duplication and loss. These changes happen as mistakes during recombination or through retrotransposition. In Han and Hahn 2011,(1) we surveyed the genomes of ten Drosophila species, to identify and characterize the gene transposition events in the history of these species. In the paper, we showed that the rate of gene transposition in Drosophila is higher than previously appreciated. To understand the process of gene transposition, we examined the sequences, locations, and functions of the transposed genes. Based on the elevated rate of sequence evolution in transposed genes and the frequent movements near the centromeres and telomeres, we could not reject the hypothesis that these are mutations fixed through relaxed selection. But, by examining the functions of transposed genes more carefully, we found that genes with male-specific functions and genes with female-specific functions move in opposite directions involving the X chromosome. We also found an over-representation of chromosome related functions among the transposed genes. These observations suggest the possibility of particular selection pressures contributing to gene transpositions in Drosophila.","249":null,"250":"Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein (htt). A pathological hallmark of the disease is the loss of a specific population of striatal neurons, and considerable attention has been paid to the role of the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan (TRP) degradation in this process. The KP contains three neuroactive metabolites: 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and kynurenic acid (KYNA). 3-HK and QUIN are neurotoxic, and are increased in the brains of early stage HD patients, as well as in yeast and mouse models of HD. Conversely, KYNA is neuroprotective and has been shown to be decreased in HD patient brains. We recently used a Drosophila model of HD to measure the neuroprotective effect of genetic and pharmacological inhibition of kynurenine monoxygenase (KMO)-the enzyme catalyzing the formation of 3-HK at a pivotal branch point in the KP. We found that KMO inhibition in Drosophila robustly attenuated neurodegeneration, and that this neuroprotection was correlated with reduced levels of 3-HK relative to KYNA. Importantly, we showed that KP metabolites are causative in this process, as 3-HK and KYNA feeding experiments modulated neurodegeneration. We also found that genetic inhibition of the upstream KP enzyme tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) was neuroprotective in flies. Here, we extend these results by reporting that genetic impairment of KMO or TDO is protective against the eclosion defect in HD model fruit flies. Our results provide further support for the possibility of therapeutic KP interventions in HD.","251":"The majority of neural stem cells (NSCs) are considered as very plastic precursors that, in vitro, can divide indefinitely or differentiate into neurons or glia under specific conditions. However, in vivo, these cells actively proliferate during development, and later enter quiescence or apoptosis. This raises the issue as to whether stem cells keep their plastic behavior throughout their life, which may impact their therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. Using the Gcm\/Glide (for Glial cell missing\/Glial cell deficient) transcription factor, which is able to trigger a complete and stable fate conversion into glia when ectopically expressed, we recently reported that the plasticity of Drosophila NSCs, commonly called neuroblasts (NBs), is age-dependent. When challenged with Gcm\/Glide, newborn NBs are more easily converted into glia than old ones. Furthermore, the few old NBs that can be converted frequently generate cells with a stable (NB\/glia) intermediate identity, a phenotype characteristic of cancer cells. We here discuss the concept of aging in NSC fate conversion and speculate on how our findings impact the ongoing debate concerning NSC plasticity.","252":"Sexual competition has selected a number of extreme phenotypes like the tail ornament of peacock male. Sperm tail of Drosophilidae elongate up to 6 cm as a result of evolutionary selection for reproductive fitness among competing sperms. Sperm elongation takes place post meiotically and can proceed in the absence of an axoneme. Here, we used primary cultures of elongating spermatids of D. melanogaster to demonstrate that sperm elongation is driven by interdependent extension of giant mitochondria and microtubule array that is formed around the mitochondrial surface. This work established that, in addition to functioning as an energy source, mitochondria can serve as internal skeleton for shaping cell morphology.","253":null,"254":"Drosophila species vary in the rates at which females remate and the number of sperm they receive in the laboratory. In species such as D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, in which females receive thousands of sperm and remate infrequently compared with species such as D. hydei and D. nigrospiracula, where females receive only a few hundred sperm and remate many times in a day, wild caught females should produce far more progeny. We tested this prediction by collecting, directly from nature, females of six species whose remating rates and number of sperm received vary from high to low and assessing the proportion of females with sperm and the number of progeny females produce. Over 95% of D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster females were inseminated while far fewer of the other species contained any sperm. In addition, D, pseudoobscura females produced progeny for over two weeks, D. melanogaster for over a week, while D. hydei and D. nigrospiracula females ran out of sperm after 1-2 d. These observations suggest extreme sperm limitation in these latter species.","255":"The infective juveniles (IJs) of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) seek out host insects and release their symbiotic bacteria into their body cavity causing septicaemia, which eventually leads to host death. The interaction between EPNs and their hosts are only partially understood, in particular the host immune responses appears to involve pathways other than phagocytosis and the canonical transcriptional induction pathways. These pathways are genetically tractable and include for example clotting factors and lipid mediators. The aim of this study was to optimize the nematode infections in Drosophila melanogaster larvae, a well-studied and genetically tractable model organism. Here we show that two nematode species namely Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora display different infectivity toward Drosophila larvae with the latter being less pathogenic. The effects of supporting media and IJ dosage on the mortality of the hosts were assessed and optimized. Using optimum conditions, a faster and efficient setup for nematode infections was developed. This newly established infection model in Drosophila larvae will be applicable in large scale screens aimed at identifying novel genes\/pathways involved in innate immune responses.","256":"Chromosomal inversions can originate from breakage and repair by non-homologous end-joining. Nevertheless, they can also originate from ectopic recombination between transposable elements located on the same chromosome inserted in opposite orientations. Here, we show that a MITE element (DAIBAM), previously involved in the origin of one Drosophila americana polymorphic inversion, is also involved in the origin of one fixed inversion between D. virilis and D. americana and another D. americana polymorphic inversion. Therefore, DAIBAM is responsible for at least 20% of the chromosomal rearrangements that are observed within and between species of the virilis phylad (D. virilis, D. lummei, D. novamexicana and D. americana), having thus played a significant role in the chromosomal evolution of this group of closely related species.","257":"Notch signaling is integral to a large number of developmental and homeostasis events, and either gain or loss of Notch signaling results in a wide range of defects. Notch must be processed by several proteases, including a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family to mediate downstream signaling. Until recently, interactions of Notch with specific ADAMs in different contexts were unclear. ADAM10 is now known to be specifically essential for development and homeostasis of mouse epidermis and cardiovascular structures, and ADAM17 may not be able to fully replace ADAM10 in these contexts. However, Notch from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients can be cleaved by both ADAMs 10 and 17. Studies have revealed that ADAM10 is necessary for Notch processing when Notch is activated by a ligand, while ADAM17 is the major protease for processing Notch that is activated independently of ligand in both flies and mammals.","258":"Aggressive behavior is widely present throughout the animal kingdom and is crucial to ensure survival and reproduction. Aggressive actions serve to acquire territory, food, or mates and in defense against predators or rivals; while in some species these behaviors are involved in establishing a social hierarchy. Aggression is a complex behavior, influenced by a broad range of genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies in Drosophila provide insight into the genetic basis and control of aggression. The state of the art on aggression in Drosophila and the many opportunities provided by this model organism to unravel the genetic and neurobiological basis of aggression are reviewed.","259":null,"260":"Equalizing sex chromosome expression between the sexes when they have largely differing gene content appears to be necessary, and across species, is accomplished in a variety of ways. Even in birds, where the process is less than complete, a mechanism to reduce the difference in gene dose between the sexes exists. In early development, while the dosage difference is unregulated and still in flux, it is frequently exploited by sex determination mechanisms. The Drosophila female sex determination process is one clear example, determining the sexes based on X chromosome dose. Recent data show that in Drosophila, the female sex not only reads this gene balance difference, but at the same time usurps the moment. Taking advantage of the transient default state of male dosage compensation, the sex determination master-switch Sex-lethal which resides on the X, has its expression levels enhanced before it works to correct the gene imbalance. Intriguingly, key developmental genes which could create developmental havoc if their levels were unbalanced show more exquisite regulation, suggesting nature distinguishes them and ensures their expression is kept in the desirable range.","261":"The ability of the microtubule cytoskeleton to rapidly and locally reorganize itself in response to intra- and extracellular signals is essential to its wide range of functions. A site of tightly regulated microtubule dynamics--and the major interface between the microtubule cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment--is the cell cortex, where the selective stabilization and destabilization of microtubule plus-ends is required for normal cell division, morphogenesis and migration. In a recent study, we found that the cortex of Drosophila S2 and D17 cells is coated with the microtubule severing enzyme and plus-end depolymerase, Kat-60, which actively suppresses microtubule growth and stability along the cell edge. We have proposed that cortical Kat-60 functions by uncapping plus-ends, thereby activating another microtubule depolymerase, KLP10A, preloaded onto the end. The localized destruction of microtubule plus-ends at a specific cortical could feed into larger regulatory pathways, such as those in control of the actin cytoskeleton, to influence cell polarization and motility.","262":"Polyandry is a paradox: why do females mate multiple times when a single ejaculate often provides enough sperm for lifetime egg production? Gowaty et al. addressed explanations for polyandry in Drosophila pseudoobscura from the perspective of hypotheses based on sex differences in costs of reproduction (CoR). Contrary to CoR, Gowaty et al. showed that (1) a single ejaculate was inadequate for lifetime egg production; (2) polyandry provided fitness benefits to females beyond provision of adequate sperm and (3) fitness benefits of polyandry were not offset by costs. Here, I discuss predictions of the ad hoc hypotheses of CoR and three alternative hypotheses to CoR to facilitate a discussion and further development of a strong inference approach to experiments on the adaptive significance of polyandry for females. Each of the hypotheses makes testable predictions; simultaneous tests of the predictions will provide a strong inference approach to understanding the adaptive significance of multiple mating. I describe a sex-symmetric experiment meant to evaluate variation in fitness among lifelong virgins (V); monogamous females and males with one copulation (MOC); monogamous females and males with multiple copulations (MMC); PAND, polyandrous females; and PGYN, polygynous males. Last, I recommend the study of many different species, while taking care in choice of study species and attention to the assumptions of specific hypotheses. I particularly urge the study of many more Drosophila species both in laboratory and the wild to understand the \"nature of flies in nature,\" where opportunities and constraints mold evolutionary responses.","263":"Phagocytosis is an evolutionarily ancient, receptor-driven process, by which phagocytic cells recognize invading microbes and destroy them after internalization. The phagocytosis receptor Eater is expressed exclusively on Drosophila phagocytes and is required for the survival of bacterial infections. In a recent study, we explored how Eater can defend fruit flies against different kinds of bacteria. We discovered that Eater bound to certain types of bacteria directly, while for others bacterial binding was dependent on prior disruption of the bacterial envelope. Similar to phagocytes, antimicrobial peptides and lysozymes are ancient components of animal immune systems. Our results suggest that cationic antimicrobial peptides, as well as lysozymes, can facilitate Eater binding to live Gram-negative bacteria. Both types of molecules promote surface-exposure of bacterial ligands that otherwise would remain buried and hidden under an outer membrane. We propose that unmasking ligands for phagocytic receptors may be a conserved mechanism operating in many animals, including humans. Thus, studying a Drosophila phagocytosis receptor may advance our understanding of innate immunity in general.","264":"Central to the study of molecular evolution, and an area of long-standing debate, is the appropriate model for the fitness landscape of proteins. Much of this debate has focused on the strength and frequency of positive and purifying selection, but the form and frequency of selective correlations is also a vital element. The constituent amino acids within a protein generically interact and share selective pressures in predictable ways, which conflicts with the selective independence assumed by common caricatures of the fitness landscape. Here, I discuss a recent study by myself and coauthors that used whole-genome comparisons of orthologous molecular sequences from closely related Drosophilids to explore the form of the selective correlations and selective interactions (epistasis) between the amino acids within a protein. I outline our results and highlight our finding of a selective length scale of ten amino acids within which individual amino acids are substantially and generically more likely to share selective pressures and interact epistatically. I then focus on the evidence presented in our study supporting a substantial role for epistasis in the process of molecular evolution, and discuss further the implications of this widespread epistasis on the overdispersion of the molecular clock and the efficacy of common tests for positive selection.","265":"The fourth chromosome of Drosophila remains one of the most intractable regions of the fly genome to genetic analysis. The main difficulty posed to the genetic analyses of mutations on this chromosome arises from the fact that it does not undergo meiotic recombination, which makes recombination mapping impossible, and also prevents clonal analysis of mutations, a technique which relies on recombination to introduce the prerequisite recessive markers and FLP-recombinase recognition targets (FRT). Here we introduce a method that overcomes these limitations and allows for the generation of single Minute haplo-4 clones of any fourth chromosome mutant gene in tissues of developing and adult flies.","266":"Drosophila suma is a flower breeding species widespread in the Afrotropical region. We describe an original and so far unique feeding behavior in that species. Strong black spines on the fore tarsus of both sexes are used for scratching the surface of the petals: the juice pouring out from the scratched cells is immediately ingested and this might be the only source of food. D. suma has been investigated on two kinds of flowers, Ipomoea and Crinum. In spite of the very different shape and color of these flowers, the feeding behavior of the flies is the same. Various morphological and anatomical adaptations are described, especially those related to laying a few very big eggs. The taxonomic position of D. suma has long remained and still is elusive. Further taxonomic and phylogenetic investigations would thus be needed to understand how adaptation to flower breeding has evolved.","267":null,"268":"Upregulation of kynurenine (KYN) formation from tryptophan (TRY) was associated with aging in animal and human studies. TRY - KYN metabolism is affected by the activities of TRY 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter regulating TRY access to intracellular TDO. We studied the effects of TDO inhibitor, alpha-methyl tryptophan (aMT), and ABC transported inhibitor, 5-methyl tryptophan (5MT), on the life span of wild strain female Drosophila flies (Oregon-R). aMT and 5MT prolonged mean and maximum life span (by 27% and 43%, and 21% and 23%, resp.). The present results are the first observation of the extension of life span of Drosophila melanogaster by inhibitors of TRY - KYN metabolism, and in line with literature and previous studies on prolonged life span of TDO- and ABC-deficient female Drosophila mutants. Inhibition of TDO and ABC transporter activity might offer the new target for anti-aging and anti-AAMPD interventions.","269":null,"270":"Our recent study found that 30% of young genes were essential for viability that determines development through stages from embryo to pupae in Drosophila melanogaster, revealing rapidly evolving genetic components involved in the evolution of development. Meanwhile, many young genes did not produce complete lethal phenotype upon constitutive knockdown, suggesting that they may not be essential for viability. These genes, nevertheless, were fixed by natural selection, and might play an important functional role in their adult stage. Here we present a detailed demonstration that a newly duplicated serine-type endopeptidase gene that originated in the common ancestor in the D. melanogaster subgroup 6~11 million years ago, named Slfc, revealing a strong effect in post-eclosion. Although animals survived constitutive knockdown of Slfc to adult stage, however, their life span reduced significantly by two-thirds compared to wildtype. Furthermore, the Slfc-RNAi males dropped their fertility to less than 10% of the wildtype level, with over 80% of these males being sterile. The Slfc-RNAi females, on the other hand, showed a slight reduction in fertility. This case study demonstrates that a young gene can contribute to fitness on the three important traits of life history in adults, including the life expectancy, male fertility and female fertility, suggesting that new genes can quickly evolve and impact multiple phenotypes.","271":null,"272":"Enhancer of rudimentary, e(r), encodes a small nuclear protein, ER, that has been implicated in the regulation of pyrimidine metabolism, DNA replication, and cell proliferation. In Drosophila melanogaster, a new recessive Notch allele, N (nd-p) , was isolated as a lethal in combination with an e(r) allele, e(r) (p2) . Both mutants are viable as single mutants. N (nd-p) is caused by a P-element insertion in the 5' UTR, 378-bp upstream of the start of translation. Together the molecular and genetic data argue that N (nd-p) is a hypomorphic allele of N. The three viable notchoid alleles, N (nd-p) , N (nd-1) , and N (nd-3) , are lethal in combination with e(r) (-) alleles. Our present hypothesis is that e(r) is a positive regulator of the Notch signaling pathway and that the lethality of the N e(r) double mutants is caused by a reduction in the expression of the pathway. This is supported by the rescue of the lethality by a mutation in Hairless, a negative regulator of N, and by the synthetic lethality of dx e(r) double mutants. Further support for the hypothesis is a reduction in E(spl) expression in an e(r) (-) mutant. Immunostaining localizes ER to the nucleus, suggesting a nuclear function for ER. A role in the Notch signaling pathway, suggests that e(r) may be expressed in the nervous system. This turns out to be the case, as immunostaining of ER shows that ER is localized to the developing CNS.","273":null,"274":"Posttranscriptional modifications of proteins by the ubiquitin and SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier) pathways regulate the function of protein networks, enable cells to respond to signaling cues during development, and to cope with the changing environment during adult life. Both modifications can impact protein stability, localization, protein-protein interactions and\/or function. While both pathways have been well studied individually, the long-speculated nature of crosstalk between SUMO and ubiquitin pathways has been molecularly enigmatic. Recent work in yeast and mammalian cells identified the connection between the two pathways in the form of a conserved family of RING finger ubiquitin ligases termed SUMO-Targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs). These proteins bind to SUMOylated substrates via their SUMO interaction motif and subsequently target them for ubiquitylation. Characterization of Degringolade (Dgrn), a STUbL gene in the fly genome, enabled us to evaluate the contribution of STUbLs to the development of multi-cellular organisms. Analysis of dgrn mutants showed that they are required for cyto-nuclear organization during early embryonic development, and are likely required to cope with mitotic stress and DNA damage. Furthermore, in transcription, STUbLs regulate protein-protein interactions, and are part of molecular machinery that regulates co-repressor choice and gene-expression selectivity during development.","275":"Neural circuit mapping and manipulation are facilitated by independent control of gene expression in pre- and post-synaptic neurons. The GAL4\/UAS and Q binary transcription systems have the potential to provide this capability. Of particular use in neural circuit mapping would be GAL4 and QF drivers specific for neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors. Recently available Drosophila genomic BAC libraries make recombineering large genes including those specific for neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors feasible. Here the functionality of cassettes that allow efficient recombineering of GAL4 and QF drivers based on kanamycin selection is demonstrated in Drosophila. The cassettes should, however, be generalizable for recombineering in other species.","276":"Mutations and most transgenes that induce ectopic cell death in Drosophila will produce an inhibitory effect on RNA interference (RNAi) in adjacent cells. When extensive cell death is sporadically induced using a heat shock promoted-head involution defective (hs-hid) transgene, molecular attributes of this inhibition can be studied. For a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) RNAi construct, cell death causes a greater accumulation of the mature mRNA and the double stranded RNA with an accompanying reduction in the homologous siRNAs. Endogenous transposable element expression is increased and there is an overall reduction in their corresponding siRNAs. The implications of this finding for the conduct of RNAi and potential reasons for its existence are discussed.","277":"We generated FM7a and CyO balancer chromosomes bearing a Tubby1 (Tb1) dominant transgene. Flies heterozygous for these FM7a and CyO derivatives exhibit a phenotype undistinguishable from that elicited by the Tb1 mutation associated with the TM6B balancer. We tested two of these Tb-bearing balancers (FM7-TbA and CyO-TbA) for more than 30 generations and found that the Tb1 transgene they carry is stable. Thus, these new Tb-tagged balancers are particularly useful for balancing lethal mutations and distinguish homozygous mutant larvae from their heterozygous siblings.","278":"The relationship between alcohol consumption, sensitivity, and tolerance is an important question that has been addressed in humans and rodent models. Studies have shown that alcohol consumption and risk of abuse may correlate with (1) increased sensitivity to the stimulant effects of alcohol, (2) decreased sensitivity to the depressant effects of alcohol, and (3) increased alcohol tolerance. However, many conflicting results have been observed. To complement these studies, we utilized a different organism and approach to analyze the relationship between ethanol consumption and other ethanol responses. Using a set of 20 Drosophila melanogaster mutants that were isolated for altered ethanol sensitivity, we measured ethanol-induced hyperactivity, ethanol sedation, sedation tolerance, and ethanol consumption preference. Ethanol preference showed a strong positive correlation with ethanol tolerance, consistent with some rodent and human studies, but not with ethanol hyperactivity or sedation. No pairwise correlations were observed between ethanol hyperactivity, sedation, and tolerance. The evolutionary conservation of the relationship between tolerance and ethanol consumption in flies, rodents, and humans indicates that there are fundamental biological mechanisms linking specific ethanol responses.","279":"Overexpression of Suppressor of Underreplication protein (SUUR) induces giant reversible swellings in intercalary and pericentric heterochromatin of salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Here, we demonstrate that morphology and extent of swellings are highly dependent on the fixation conditions used: upon glutaraldehyde fixation, we observed moderate decondensation of heterochromatic regions, which was significantly more pronounced upon acetic-acid fixation. Swellings are formed in a PARP-independent fashion. Together with data on inactive transcription in them, this indicates that the swelling-forming regions fail to acquire any features of puffs, the regions typically forming locally decondensed chromatin. Large swellings display striking re-localization of histones and SUUR protein, which are now found at the periphery of the swellings, in contrast to the DNA that fills the entirety of the swelling. We show that swelling-embedded DNA is capable of undergoing replication, however SUUR overexpression drastically alters replication timing in salivary gland cells. We speculate that swelling formation results from SUUR tipping the balance against other proteins that contribute to the organization of repressed chromatin regions.","280":"Drosophila has been established as useful model for infectious diseases because it allows large numbers of whole animals to be studied and provides powerful genetic tools and conservation with signaling and pathogenesis mechanisms in vertebrates. During the past twenty years, significant progress has been made on the characterization of innate immune responses against various pathogenic organisms in flies (Fig. 1). In this year's Drosophila Research Conference, which was held in San Diego (March 30-April 3) and sponsored by the Genetics Society of America, the immunity and pathogenesis session comprised seven platform presentations and 34 posters that highlighted the latest advances in Drosophila infection and immunity field. The presented work covered a wide range of studies from immune signaling pathways and the molecular basis of humoral and cellular immune mechanisms to the role of endosymbionts in fly immune function and effects of immune priming. Here, we give an overview of the presented work and we explain how these findings will open new avenues in Drosophila immunity research.","281":null,"282":"As early as 1964 it was suggested that simple diffusion of morphogens away from their secretion source did not provide an adequate explanation for the formation and maintenance of morphogen gradients. Involvement of the endosome in morphogen distribution models provides an explanation for the slow, directional movement of morphogens, as well as their ability to form intracellular and extracellular gradients independent of morphogen production rates. Drosophila melanogaster morphogens Wg and Dpp form stable, steep, long-range gradients that specify the polarity of the wing disc. The process of endocytosis is imperative to the two central themes in gradient formation: active transport facilitating long-range signaling and degradation of morphogen to sustain gradient shape. This review investigates the endomembrane-mediated processes of re-secretion, degradation and argosome transport of Wg and Dpp in the hope that a better understanding of the endomembrane system will contribute to a more accurate and comprehensive model for morphogen gradient formation and maintenance.","283":"Comprehensive understanding of tissues and organs development requires a detailed description of tissues specific developmental programs. In particular, Gene Regulatory Networks need to be analyzed at the tissue level, requiring organ specific transcriptional landscapes to be established. Here, we describe an efficient and stringent strategy for cell purification of differentiating cells from Drosophila embryos by flow cytometry. This, combined to mRNA amplification, can be used for transcriptomic analysis of small, tissue-specific cell populations. We present an application to the Drosophila cardiac system, whose cell population represents 0.5 to 1% of total cells within the whole embryo. Based on widely available fluorescent reporter transgenes, this method should be applicable to a number of tissues and organs.","284":"What triggers a differentiated cell to naturally change its cell fate? Cell reprogramming is a rare and intriguing phenomenon, from a developmental point of view. It has been mostly involved in boundary sharpening during development, tissue regeneration and cancer. Developmental models of the understanding of pathology-related cell reprogramming are yet to be established. Here we comment on the recently discovered \"Mixer Cells\" undergoing highly stereotyped developmental reprogramming during Drosophila epidermal morphogenesis. The JNK signaling pathway, which is involved in regenerative cell reprogramming, is essential to Mixer Cell formation. Thus the Mixer Cell model may provide a link between developmental cell reprogramming and regeneration.","285":"Much of developmental biology is concerned with the processes by which cells become committed to particular fates in a regulated fashion, whereas cell biology addresses, among other things, the variety of differentiated forms and functions that cells can acquire. One open question is how the regulators of the former process lead to attainment of the latter. 'High-level' regulators of cell fate specification include the proneural factors, which drive cells to commit as precursors in the sensory nervous system. Recent research has concentrated on the gene expression events downstream of proneural factor function. Here we summarise this research and describe our own research that has provided clear links between a proneural factor, atonal, and the cell biological programme of ciliogenesis, which is a central aspect of sensory neuron differentiation.","286":"The choice of egg laying site and progeny's performance in a rearing site are important components of habitat selection. Despite the huge amount of genetic, morphological, behavioral and physiological data regarding Drosophila melanogaster Meigen and D. simulans Sturtevant, oviposition site preferences remain poorly known. We investigated resource preference (acceptance and choice) and performance (measured as larval viability, developmental time and wing size) in Vitis vinifera Linneo (grape) and Cydonia oblonga Miller (quince), two fruit plants that D. melanogaster and D. simulans use as breeding substrates in Western Argentina. Females of both species preferred V. vinifera over C. oblonga when offered to lay eggs on grape and\/or quince, with D. melanogaster showing a more biased preference for V. vinifera than its sibling. Concerning performance, flies reared in C. oblonga developed faster than in V. vinifera, regardless of the species and D. simulans had a shorter developmental time than D. melanogaster. We also observed inter and intraspecific (between flies reared in different resources) differences in wing size and shape. Our study provides novel data concerning ecological aspects scarcely addressed in these species, and suggest that the use of different resource may be a relevant factor in their recent evolutionary history.","287":"Planar cell polarity (PCP) describes the orientation of a cell within the plane of an epithelial cell layer. During tissue development, epithelial cells normally align their PCP so that they face in the same direction. This alignment allows cells to move in a common direction, or to generate structures with a common orientation. A classic system for studying the coordination of epithelial PCP is the developing Drosophila wing. The alignment of epithelial PCP during pupal wing development allows the production of an array of cell hairs that point towards the wing tip. Multiple studies have established that the Frizzled (Fz) PCP signaling pathway coordinates wing PCP. Recently, we have found that the same pathway also controls the formation of ridges on the Drosophila wing membrane. However, in contrast to hair polarity, ridge orientation differs between the anterior and posterior wing. How can the Fz PCP pathway generate a different relationship between hair and ridge orientation in different parts of the wing? In this Extra View article, we discuss membrane ridge development drawing upon our recent PLoS Genetics paper and other, published and unpublished, data. We also speculate upon how our findings impact the ongoing debate concerning the interaction of the Fz PCP and Fat\/Dachsous pathways in the control of PCP.","288":"Hybrid males from reciprocal crosses of specific strains of the closely related species Drosophila mojavensis and Drosophila arizonae are sterile. The sterile hybrid males exhibit testis and seminal vesicle phenotypes that differ from their parental strains and from each other both in lengths of the organs and the development of the spermatids as seen in light and electron microscopy. Incompatibilities affecting spermiogenesis differ in reciprocal crosses, suggesting that hybrid male sterility may originate from a range of different underlying mechanisms.","289":"Commensal bacteria can induce sexual isolation between populations of Drosophila. This phenomenon has implications for speciation, and raises questions about its behavioral and developmental mechanisms, which are not yet known. In this Extra View, we discuss related work by others, bearing directly on these issues, and we speculate about how bacteria might influence fly behavior. There are many reports of interaction between Drosophila and their microbiota that significantly impacts mating preferences. Sexual isolation can be enhanced or reduced by altering the culture media, or the microbiota inhabiting those media. More dramatically, the endoparasite Wolbachia has induced strong mate preferences in some instances. While a sudden, ecologically induced shift in mating preferences falls far short of the changes required for speciation, it might be a first step in that direction. We hypothesize that bacteria-induced sexual isolation is caused by chemosensory cues. In our experiments, bacteria altered the profile of cuticular hydrocarbons, which function as sex pheromones. Commensal bacteria may act directly on these hydrocarbons, or they may affect their synthesis. Alternatively, bacterial metabolites might perfume the flies in ways that affect mate choice. In that event, habituation or conditioning likely plays a role.","290":"In a recent publication, we identified a novel F-box protein, encoded by fates-shifted (fsd), that plays a role in targeting Bcd for ubiquitination and degradation. Our analysis of mutant Drosophila embryos suggests that Bcd protein degradation is important for proper gradient formation and developmental fate specification. Here we describe further experiments that lead to an estimate of Bcd half-life, &lt; 15 min, in embryos during the time of gradient formation. We use our findings to evaluate different models of Bcd gradient formation. With this new estimate, we simulate the Bcd gradient formation process in our own biologically realistic 2-D model. Finally, we discuss the role of Bcd-encoded positional information in controlling the positioning and precision of developmental decisions.","291":"Stem cells proliferate through symmetric division or self-renew through asymmetric division whilst generating differentiating cell types. The balance between symmetric and asymmetric division requires tight control to either expand a stem cell pool or to generate cell diversity. In the Drosophila optic lobe, symmetrically dividing neuroepithelial cells transform into asymmetrically dividing neuroblasts. The switch from neuroepithelial cells to neuroblasts is triggered by a proneural wave that sweeps across the neuroepithelium. Here we review recent findings showing that the orchestrated action of the Notch, EGFR, Fat-Hippo, and JAK\/STAT signalling pathways controls the progression of the proneural wave and the sequential transition from symmetric to asymmetric division. The neuroepithelial to neuroblast transition in the optic lobe bears many similarities to the switch from neuroepithelial cell to radial glial cell in the developing mammalian cerebral cortex. The Notch signalling pathway has a similar role in the transition from proliferating to differentiating stem cell pools in the developing vertebrate retina and in the neural tube. Therefore, findings in the Drosophila optic lobe provide insights into the transitions between proliferative and differentiative division in the stem cell pools of higher organisms.","292":"Obesity has reached pandemic proportions globally and is often associated with lipotoxic heart diseases. In the obese state, caloric surplus is accommodated in the adipocytes as triglycerides. As the storage capacity of adipocytes is exceeded or malfunctioning, lipids begin to infiltrate and accumulate in non-adipose tissues, including the myocardium of the heart, leading to organ dysfunction. While the disruption of caloric homeostasis has been widely viewed as a principal mechanism in contributing to peripheral tissue steatosis and lipotoxicity, our recent studies in Drosophila have led to the novel finding that deregulation of phospholipid homeostasis may also significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. Fly mutants that bear perturbations in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis, such as the easily-shocked (eas) mutants defective in ethanolamine kinase, incurred aberrant activation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathway, thereby causing chronic lipogenesis and cardiac steatosis that culminates in the development of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. Here, we describe the potential relationship between SREBP and other eas-associated phenotypes, such as neuronal excitability defects. We will further discuss the additional implications presented by our work toward the effects of altered lipid metabolism on cellular growth and\/or proliferation in response to defective phospholipid homeostasis.","293":"Alternative splicing provides one of the major mechanisms by which eukaryotic genomes can increase the diversity of transcripts and protein products encoded by a limited amount of genes. The spliceosome is involved in recognizing and removing intronic sequences and it is guided in this activity by splicing regulatory factors that determine the particular splice sites that are to be recognized and used for intron removal. Thus, by modulating the spliceosome's activity, these factors can cause different mRNA transcripts to be generated from the same precursor mRNA. In a recent RNAi screen for factors modulating RAS\/MAPK signaling, we identified the Drosophila exon junction complex (EJC) as one of the components regulating the splicing of mapk transcripts. We showed that removal of EJC components caused multiple consecutive mapk exons to be skipped. Moreover, we determined that other fly genes that, like mapk, had particularly large introns, were also sensitive to disruption of the EJC. The importance of intron length in determining sensitivity to EJC disruption suggests that the EJC is functioning in exon definition, a splicing mechanism that occurs for long introns in particular.","294":"Drosophila melanogaster is ideal for studying lifespan modulated by dietary restriction (DR) and oxidative stress, and also for screening prolongevity compounds. It is critical to measure food intake in the aforementioned studies. Current methods, however, overlook the amount of the food excreted out of the flies as feces or deposited in eggs. Here we describe a feeding method using a radioactive tracer to measure gender-specific food intake, retention and excretion in response to DR and oxidative stress to account for all the ingested food. Flies were fed a full, restricted or paraquat-containing diet. The radioactivity values of the food in fly bodies, feces and eggs were measured separately after a 24-hr feeding. Food intake was calculated as the sum of these measurements. We found that most of the tracer in the ingested food was retained in the fly bodies and &lt; 8% of the tracer was excreted out of the flies as feces and eggs in the case of females during a 24-hr feeding. Under a DR condition, flies increased food intake in volume to compensate for the reduction of calorie content in the diet and also slightly increased excretion. Under an oxidative stress condition, flies reduced both food intake and excretion. Under all the tested dietary conditions, males ingested and excreted 3-5 fold less food than females. This study describes an accurate method to measure food intake and provides a basis to further investigate prandial response to DR and prolongevity interventions in invertebrates.","295":"Perhaps the most fundamental aspect of development is the acquisition by a cell of a terminal and stable fate because it marks the usually irreversible commitment to a specific morphology and function. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control this process has profound implications for stem cell biology and cancer research. Because cell fate commitment is regulated by transcription factors acting as master switches, a mechanistic understanding of the process requires revealing the gene regulatory networks downstream of these factors. We discuss the biological functions of the proneural targetome in the light of signaling pathways, and the recent progress on computational target gene predictions using cisTargetX.","296":"The molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is an active metabolite of ecdysone and plays vital roles during ontogeny of the fruit fly Drosophila, coordinating critical developmental transitions such as molting and metamorphosis. Although 20E is known to exist throughout life in both male and female flies, its functions in adult physiology and behavior remain largely elusive. Notably, findings from previous studies suggest that this hormone may be involved in adult stress responses. Consistent with this possibility, we have found that ecdysone signaling in adult flies is activated by \"stressful\" social interactions and plays a role in the formation of long-term courtship memory [Ishimoto et al. (2009). Ecdysone signaling regulates the formation of long-term courtship memory in adult Drosophila melanogaster. PNAS 106, 6381-6386]. In addition, we recently reported that ecdysone signaling contributes to the regulation of sleep, affecting transitions between sleep and wakefulness [Ishimoto and Kitamoto. (2010). The steroid molting hormone ecdysone regulates sleep in adult Drosophila melanogaster. Genetics 185, 269-281]. Here in Extra Views, we first summarize our findings on the unconventional roles of 20E in regulating memory and sleep in adult flies. We then discuss speculative ideas concerning the stress hormone-like features of 20E, as well as the possibility that ecdysone signaling contributes to remodeling of the adult nervous system, at both the functional and structural levels, through epigenetic mechanisms.","297":"Mtl is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases in Drosophila. It was shown that Mtl is involved in planar cell polarity (PCP) establishment, together with other members of the same family like Cdc42, Rac1, Rac2 and RhoA. However, while Rac1, Rac2 and RhoA function downstream of Dsh in Fz\/PCP signaling and upstream of a JNK cassette, Mtl and Cdc42 do not. To determine the functional context of Mtl during PCP establishment in the Drosophila eye, we performed a loss-of-function screen to search for dominant modifiers of a sev&gt;Mtl rough eye phenotype. In addition, genetic interaction assays with candidate genes were also carried out. Our results show that Mtl interacts genetically with members and effectors of Egfr signaling, with components and\/or regulators of other signal transduction pathways, and with genes involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization. One of these genes is hibris (hbs), which encodes a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily in Drosophila. Phenotypic analyses and genetic interaction assays suggest that it may have a role during PCP establishment, interacting with both Egfr and Fz\/PCP signaling during this process. Taken together, our results indicate that Mtl is functionally related to the Egfr pathway regulating ommatidial rotation during PCP establishment in the eye, being a positive regulator of this pathway. Since Egfr signaling is linked to cytoskeletal and cell junctional elements, it is likely that Mtl may be regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and thus cell adhesion during ommatidial rotation in the context of that pathway.","298":"Orchestration of spatial organization by signaling gradients--morphogen gradients--is a fundamental principle in animal development. Despite their importance in tissue patterning and growth, the exact mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of morphogen gradients are poorly understood. Our recent work on BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) morphogen signaling during wing development identified a novel protein, Pentagone (Pent), as a critical regulator of morphogen activity. In the following, we discuss the properties of Pent and its role as a feed-back loop in morphogen gradient formation.","299":"We have assembled a molecular toolkit enabling the facile generation of C-terminal fluorescent protein fusion constructs for the construction of transgenic Drosophila lines in the form of a series of modified vectors for P-element transformation. These vectors contain one of a variety of fluorescent tags including GFP, mCherry, Venus, Cerulean, photoactivatable paGFP and the red-to-green photoconvertible protein Dendra and provide a range of options with respect to transcriptional regulation. The vectors have been extensively tested in vivo and can produce fluorescent chimeric proteins that are functional.","300":"The use of P element collections led to the discovery of unanticipated effects from common genetic background mutants white, brown, and rosy in our previously reported model of tauopathy that expresses full-length human tau in the fly eye, in which mutant rosy suppresses mutant white and brown worsening of tau-induced toxicity (Ambegaokar &amp; Jackson, 2010, Genetics, v. 186, p. 435-42). Here we discuss further possible effects of mini-white and evidence for autophagy as a mediator of white enhancement of tau toxicity.","301":"Transcription is the first step through which the cell operates, via its repertoire of transcription complexes, to direct cellular functions and cellular identity by generating the cell-specific transcriptome. The modularity of the composition of constituents of these complexes allows the cell to delicately regulate its transcriptome. In a recent study we have examined the effects of reducing the levels of specific transcription co-factors on the function of two competing transcription complexes, namely CHIP-AP and CHIP-PNR which regulate development of cells in the thorax of Drosophila. We found that changing the availability of these co-factors can shift the balance between these complexes leading to transition from utilization of CHIP-AP to CHIP-PNR. This is reflected in change in the expression profile of target genes, altering developmental cell fates. We propose that such a mechanism may operate in normal fly development. Transcription complexes analogous to CHIP-AP and CHIP-PNR exist in mammals and we discuss how such a shift in the balance between them may operate in normal mammalian development.","302":"Creating designer mutations in large genes is a challenge. Size limitations imposed by site-directed mutagenesis (SDM), coupled with the paucity of unique restriction enzyme sites, make subsequent cloning of these constructs extremely difficult. \"Mutagenesis via Serial Small Mismatch Recombineering\" (MSSMR) combines sequential recombineering steps with SDM to create seamless, pre-specified mutations as small as a single base pair. We demonstrate the simultaneous cloning of wild type and mutant constructs of a &gt; 30 kb gene directly into attB transformation vectors. No post-transformation manipulations are required, and because the technique relies on recombineering methods, addition of undesired mutations via PCR is minimized.","303":"Myogenesis in Drosophila embryos requires fusion between Founder cells (FCs) and Fusion Competent myoblasts (FCMs) to form multinucleate myotubes. Myoblast fusion is well characterized in embryos, and many factors required for this process have been identified; however, a number of questions pertaining to the mechanisms of fusion remain and are challenging to answer in the embryo. We have developed a modified primary cell culture protocol to address these questions in vitro. Using this system, we determined the optimal time for examining fusion in culture and confirmed that known fusion proteins are expressed and localized as in embryos. Importantly, we disrupted the actin and microtubule networks with the drugs latrunculin B and nocodazole, respectively, confirming that actin is required for myoblast fusion and showing for the first time that microtubules are also required for this process in Drosophila. Finally, we show that myotubes in culture adopt and maintain specific muscle identities.","304":"Dosage compensation of X-linked genes is a phenomenon of concerted, chromosome-wide regulation of gene expression underpinned by sustained and tightly regulated histone modifications and chromatin remodeling, coupled with constrains of nuclear architecture. This elaborate process allows the accomplishment of regulated expression of genes on the single male X chromosome to levels comparable to those expressed from the two X chromosomes in females. The ribonucleoprotein Male Specific Lethal (MSL) complex is enriched on the male X chromosome and is intricately involved in this process in Drosophila melanogaster. In this review we discuss the recent advances that highlight the complexity lying behind regulation of gene expression by just two-fold.","305":"During prophase of meiosis I, genetic recombination is initiated with a Spo11-dependent DNA double-strand break (DSB). Repair of these DSBs can generate crossovers, which become chiasmata and are important for the process of chromosome segregation. To ensure at least one chiasma per homologous pair of chromosomes, the number and distribution of crossovers is regulated. One system contributing to the distribution of crossovers is the pachytene checkpoint, which requires the conserved gene pch2 that encodes an AAA+ATPase family member. Pch2-dependent pachytene checkpoint function causes delays in pachytene progression when there are defects in processes required for crossover formation, such as mutations in DSB-repair genes and when there are defects in the structure of the meiotic chromosome axis. Thus, the pachytene checkpoint appears to monitor events leading up to the generation of crossovers. Interestingly, heterozygous chromosome rearrangements cause Pch2-dependent pachytene delays and as little as two breaks in the continuity of the paired chromosome axes are sufficient to evoke checkpoint activity. These chromosome rearrangements also cause an interchromosomal effect on recombination whereby crossing over is suppressed between the affected chromosomes but is increased between the normal chromosome pairs. We have shown that this phenomenon is also due to pachytene checkpoint activity.","306":"While microarray experiments generate voluminous data, discerning trends that support an existing or alternative paradigm is challenging. To synergize hypothesis building and testing, we designed the Pathogen Associated Drosophila MicroArray (PADMA) database for easy retrieval and comparison of microarray results from immunity-related experiments (www.padmadatabase.org). PADMA also allows biologists to upload their microarray-results and compare it with datasets housed within PADMA. We tested PADMA using a preliminary dataset from Ganaspis xanthopoda-infected fly larvae, and uncovered unexpected trends in gene expression, reshaping our hypothesis. Thus, the PADMA database will be a useful resource to fly researchers to evaluate, revise, and refine hypotheses.","307":"The Toll receptor propagates the ventralizing signal designating dorsal\/ventral cell fate in the Drosophila embryo. The application of live-imaging approaches to this classical developmental signaling pathway is yielding some surprising new insights into Toll receptor signaling. In addition to its previously known plasma membrane localization, Toll is present in Rab5+ early endosomes. Dominant, constitutively active forms of Toll preferentially partition into endosomes. Blocking endocytosis locally prevents Toll from signaling suggesting that endocytosis is required for Toll to signal. Augmenting endocytosis increases Toll signaling. Both interventions alter the shape of the Dorsal gradient globally indicating an important role of endocytosis in fixing spatial information for the Dorsal gradient.","308":"Here we highlight our recent study, which revealed a mechanism critical for tight regulation of Drosophila myc (dmyc) transcription. Our previous work demonstrated that the RRM (RNA recognition motif) protein Half pint (Hfp) behaves as a growth and cell cycle inhibitor and work from D. Levens group has shown the mammalian ortholog, FIR (the FBP Interacting Repressor), is a tumor suppressor. Although RRM domain containing proteins such as Hfp and FIR have been ascribed splicing and transcriptional roles, our work suggests that Hfp is likely to achieve cell cycle inhibition via direct repression of dmyc transcription. We have demonstrated that Hfp binds to the dmyc promoter and is essential for repression of dmyc transcription, which requires interaction between Hfp and the DNA helicase subunit of Transcription Factor IIH (TFIIH), Haywire (Hay). Consistent with the increased levels of dmyc transcription, loss of Hfp makes cells overgrow in a manner dependent on the presence of dMyc. Thus our work has demonstrated that Hfp is critical for repression of dmyc and suggested a transcriptional, rather than splicing, mechanism underlies the ability of Hfp to regulate dMyc and function as a tumor suppressor. Thus we have extended knowledge from previous mammalian studies by providing in vivo evidence that the FIR homolog Hfp is required for repression of dmyc transcription, suggesting the mechanism proposed for repression of c-myc transcription by the mammalian RRM protein FIR is conserved in Drosophila.","309":"The epithelial follicle cell layer over the egg chamber in Drosophila ovary undergoes patterning and morphogenesis at oogenesis. These developmental processes are essential for constructing the eggshell and establishing the body axes of the egg and resultant embryo, thereby being crucial for the egg development. We have previously shown that lethal(2)giant larvae (lgl), a Drosophila neoplastic tumor suppressor gene (nTSG) is required for the posterior follicle cell (PFC) fate induction during antero-posterior pattern formation of the follicular epithelium. In this report, we further characterize lgl in this epithelium patterning and the morphogenetic changes of specified border cells. Genetic interactions of lgl with discs large (dlg) and scribble (scrib), another two nTSGs in specifying the PFC fate reveal a cooperative role of this group of genes. Meanwhile, we find that loss of lgl function causes failure of follicle cells at the anterior to differentiate properly. The clonal analysis further indicates that lgl is necessary not only for the border cell differentiation, but also for control of the collective border cell migration via presumably modulating the apico-basal polarity and cell adhesion. Overall, we identify Lgl as an essential factor in regulating differentiation and morphogenetic movement of the ovarian epithelial follicle cells.","310":"Scientists like to consider themselves as especially objective, but, however hard we try we cannot be very different from everyone else. Like them we helplessly absorb our knowledge, our perspectives, our valuation of whether something is exciting or boring from those around us. In this \"extra view\" I reflect on fashion, illustrating by a small discovery of ours, and discussing why it was not made before.","311":null,"312":"Definitive evidence on the impact of MnSOD\/SOD2-deficiency and the consequent effects of high flux of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) on pre-natal\/pre-adult development has yet to be reported for either Drosophila or mice. Here we report that oocytes lacking maternal SOD2 protein develop into adults just like normal SOD2-containing oocytes suggesting that maternal SOD2-mediated protection against mitochondrial ROS is not essential for oocyte viability. However, the capacity of SOD2-null larvae to undergo successful metamorphosis into adults is negatively influenced in the absence of SOD2. We therefore determined the impact of a high superoxide environment on cell size, progression through the cell cycle, cell differentiation, and cell death and found no difference between SOD2-null and SOD2+ larva and pupa. Thus loss of SOD2 activity clearly has no effect on pre-adult imaginal tissues. Instead, we found that the high mitochondrial superoxide environment arising from the absence of SOD2 leads to the induction of autophagy. Such autophagic response may underpin the resistance of pre-adult tissues to unscavenged ROS. Finally, while our data establish that SOD2 activity is less essential for normal development, the mortality of Sod2-\/- neonates of both Drosophila and mice suggests that SOD2 activity is indeed essential for the viability of adults. We therefore asked if the early mortality of SOD2-null young adults could be rescued by activation of SOD2 expression. The results support the conclusion that the early mortality of SOD2-null adults is largely attributable to the absence of SOD2 activity in the adult per se. This finding somewhat contradicts the widely held notion that failure to scavenge the high volume of superoxide emanating from the oxidative demands of development would be highly detrimental to developing tissues.","313":"In early years of neurogenetics of Drosophila, most of us were inclined to believe that behavior of the fruit fly is largely stereotyped and hard-wired. This, at least, was a common prejudice when genetic analysis of olfaction began. We now know that Drosophila like other insects is capable of several types of learning or experience-dependent modification of behavior.","314":"Drosophila embryonic hemocytes have emerged as a potent system to analyze the roles of key regulators of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons live and in an in vivo context (see Table I and references therein). The relative ease with which live imaging can be used to visualize the invasive migrations of these highly motile macrophages and their responses to wound and chemoattractant signals make them a particularly appropriate and genetically tractable cell type to study in relation to pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis and inflammation. ( 1-3) In order to understand how signaling pathways are integrated for a coordinated response, a question with direct relevance to autoimmune dysfunction, we have sought to more fully characterize the inputs these cells receive in vivo over the course of their developmental dispersal. These studies have recently revealed that hemocyte migration is intimately associated with the development of the ventral nerve cord (VNC), a structure used by hemocytes to disperse over the embryo that itself requires this association for its correct morphogenesis. Crucially the VNC must separate from the epidermis to create a channel for hemocyte migration, revealing how constriction of extracellular space can be used to control cell migration in vivo. ( 4).","315":"The ability to detect changes in oxygen concentration in the environment is critical to the survival of all animals. This requires cells to express a molecular oxygen sensor that can detect shifts in oxygen levels and transmit a signal that leads to the appropriate cellular response. Recent biochemical, genetic and behavioral studies have shown that the atypical soluble guanylyl cyclases function as oxygen detectors in Drosophila larvae triggering a behavioral escape response when exposed to hypoxia. These studies also identified the sensory neurons that innervate the terminal sensory cones as likely chemosensors that mediate this response. Here I summarize the data that led to these conclusions and also highlight evidence that suggests additional, as yet unidentified, proteins are also required for detecting increases and decreases in oxygen concentrations.","316":"Inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is a hallmark of human cancer. Accordingly the RB pathway has been extensively studied in mammals, flies and worms, but mostly in the context of cell cycle entry. The means by which RB proteins regulate differentiation and the transcription of genes involved in differentiation and development is less well understood. We have examined how Drosophila RB proteins regulate differentiation-specific genes in proliferating cells. We found that the mechanism of repression differs from what has been observed at cell cycle regulated genes (Figure 1). Two different chromatin modifications present at different locations contribute to the repression of such genes. We argue that this represents a novel mechanism of repression and that this type of regulation by RB proteins warrants further attention.","317":"Quantitative assessment of gene regulation is critical for mathematical modeling of transcriptional systems for systems biology efforts. Enhancers, also termed cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), are the primary mediators of transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes; transcription factors binding to CRMs dictate the likelihood and frequency of promoter activation. To provide a suitable platform for in-depth CRM analysis, we adapted a targeted integration vector to compare action of basal promoters with diverse combination of TATA, Inr and DPE motifs, as well as a set of 3'-UTRs representative of those used in different reporter vectors. This \"Honda\" series of reporter gene vectors was activated by a regulatory element binding Dorsal and Twist activators suitable for transcription in the early Drosophila embryo. The diverse promoters functioned in a similar manner with minor quantitative differences, consistent with a lack of enhancer-promoter specificity. Constructs bearing SV40 3'-UTR sequences appeared to produce somewhat higher levels of mRNA. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the mRNA distribution produced by these constructs was punctate; this pattern appears to be dependent on 5'-UTR sequences, as an optimized vector including an alternate 5'-UTR produced a more even distribution, which may be preferable for quantitative imaging. This set of Honda vectors contains convenient sites for modification of basal promoter, 3' UTR, and enhancer, and will be useful for analysis of CRMs and quantitative studies of gene expression.","318":null,"319":null,"320":"Chemical communication between individual Drosophila is extremely important for social behaviors required for survival and reproduction, such as con-specific recognition, courtship, aggression and avoidance of odor from \"stressed\" flies. Characterization of the receptors and neural circuits that detect pheromone cues and an understanding of how these circuits are modulated by the social interactions are fundamental questions about the neurobiology of social behaviors. Recent years have seen important advances in the identification of chemoreceptors and sensory neurons that are involved in sensing pheromones. Here we present a brief review of the current understanding of the peripheral chemosensory systems that are involved in social behaviors.","321":"Male Drosophila fruit flies acquire and defend territories in order to attract females for reproduction. Both, male-directed agonistic behavior and female-directed courtship consist of series of recurrent stereotypical components. Various studies demonstrated the importance of species-specific sound patterns generated by wing vibration as being critical for male courtship success. In this study we analyzed the patterns and importance of sound signals generated during agonistic interactions of male Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast to acoustic courtship signals that consist of sine and pulse patterns and are generated by one extended wing, agonistic signals lack sine-like components and are generally produced by simultaneous movements of both wings. Though intra-pulse oscillation frequencies (carrier frequency) are identical, inter-pulse intervals are twice as long and more variable in aggression signals than in courtship songs, where their precise temporal pattern serves species recognition. Acoustic signals accompany male agonistic interactions over their entire course but occur particularly often after tapping behavior which is a major way to identify the gender of the interaction partner. Since similar wing movements may either be silent or generate sound and wing movements with sound have a greater impact on the subsequent behavior of a receiver, sound producing wing movements seem to be generated intentionally to serve as a specific signal during fruit fly agonistic encounters.","322":"In recent years, the field of evolutionary biology received a fresh impulse from the increased technical and logistical availability and cost-effectiveness of genomics techniques. In particular, we have for the first time the opportunity to effectively explore and understand the genetic basis of traits variation in laboratory (and ultimately wild) populations. Traits that are most relevant in evolutionary and ecological contexts (e.g. morphological, life-history and behavioural traits) typically show a complex genetic architecture, being affected by many loci with small effect. Such loci often interact with one another over the same trait (epistasis), affect several traits simultaneously (pleiotropy), and\/or depend in their effects on the \"environmental condition\" in which they are expressed (genotype by environment interactions). Modern genomics offers tools, such as microarrays and high-throughput sequencing, to gather an unprecedented amount of data on gene expression and sequence variation, and can be used in the attempt to construct a genotype-phenotype map, linking genes (or gene networks), and the variation in their sequence and expression, with the natural variation of phenotypic characters.","323":"During development, transient stem cells play critical roles in the formation of specific tissues. Adult Muscle Precursors (AMPs) are at the origin of all adult Drosophila muscles and as we report here represent a novel population of muscle-committed transient stem cells. Similar to vertebrate muscle stem cells, AMPs keep Notch signaling active and express Enhancer of split m6 (E(spl)m6) gene, a read-out of Notch pathway. To get insights into AMP cell specification we performed a gain-of-function screen and found that the rhomboid-triggered Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling pathway controls both the specification and the subsequent maintenance of AMPs. Our findings are supported by the identification of EGF-secreting cells in the lateral domain and the EGF-dependent regulatory modules that drive expression of the ladybird gene in lateral AMPs. Interestingly, by targeting GFP to the AMP cell membranes we also demonstrated that AMPs send long cellular processes and form a network of interconnected cells. As revealed by laser ablation experiments, the main role of AMP cell connections is to maintain their correct spatial positioning.","324":"The sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathway plays a central role in the global regulation of lipid homeostasis. SREBPs are membrane-bound transcription factors whose proteolytic activation is regulated by cellular lipid levels; when demand for lipid rises, SREBP travels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved by two distinct proteases. Cleavage releases the transcription factor domain of SREBP from the membrane-bound precursor and transcription of its target genes consequently rises. Previously, we isolated Drosophila mutants null for dsrebp and others lacking site-2 protease (ds2p), the second of two Golgi-resident proteases that cleave dSREBP. dScap is a protein needed to escort dSREBP from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. We recently characterized the phenotypes of dscap mutants as well. Here, we describe additional details of phenotypes arising from the inability to activate SREBP appropriately.","325":"The sequencing of the genomes of 12 Drosophila species has created an opportunity for much in the way of comparative molecular analyses amongst these species. To aid that endeavor, we have made several transformation vectors based on the piggyBac transposon with 3xP3-EGFP and -ECFP transgenic markers that should be useful for mutagenesis and establishing the GAL4\/UAS system in these species. We have tested the ability of mini-white to be used as a marker for insertional mutagenesis, and have observed mini-white derived pigmentation of the testes sheath in a subset of lines from D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis. We have incorporated a source of piggyBac transposase into nine Drosophila species, and have demonstrated the functionality of these transposase lines for mobilization of marked inserts in vivo. Additionally, we tested the ability of a D. melanogaster nanos enhancer element to drive expression of GAL4 in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. erecta, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. The efficacy of the nos-Gal4 transgene was determined by measuring the response of UAS-EGFPtub in all six species. Our results show that D. melanogaster nos-Gal4 drives expression in other species, to varying degrees, in similar spatiotemporal domains in the ovaries, testes, and embryos as seen in D. melanogaster. However, expression levels are variable, demonstrating the possible need to use species-specific promoters in some cases. In summary, we hope to provide a set of guidelines and basic tools, based upon this work, for both insertional mutagenesis and GAL4\/UAS system-based experiments in multiple species of Drosophila.","326":"While many quantifiable biological phenomena can be described by making use of an assumption of normality in the distribution of individual values, many biological phenomena are not accurately described by the normal distribution. An unquestioned assumption of normality of distribution of possible outcomes can lead to misinterpretation of data, which could have serious consequences. Thus it is extremely important to test the validity of an assumption of normality of possible outcomes. As it turns out, the logarithmic-normal (log-normal) distribution pattern is often far more accurate in describing statistical biological phenomena. Herein I examine large samples of values for circulating blood cell (hemocyte) concentration (CHC) among both wild-type and mutant Drosophila larvae, and demonstrate in both cases that the distribution of individual values does not conform to normality, but does conform to log-normality.","327":"FLIGHT (http:\/\/flight.icr.ac.uk\/) is an online resource compiling data from high-throughput Drosophila in vivo and in vitro RNAi screens. FLIGHT includes details of RNAi reagents and their predicted off-target effects, alongside RNAi screen hits, scores and phenotypes, including images from high-content screens. The latest release of FLIGHT is designed to enable users to upload, analyze, integrate and share their own RNAi screens. Users can perform multiple normalizations, view quality control plots, detect and assign screen hits and compare hits from multiple screens using a variety of methods including hierarchical clustering. FLIGHT integrates RNAi screen data with microarray gene expression as well as genomic annotations and genetic\/physical interaction datasets to provide a single interface for RNAi screen analysis and data-mining in Drosophila.","328":"HP1 is a conserved prototype protein that plays an essential role in heterochromatin formation and epigenetic gene silencing through its interaction with histone methyltransferase enzymes (HMTases) and the histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-MeK9). HP1 is also involved in telomere capping and, more surprisingly, in positive regulation of gene expression. Recently, a wide expression analysis, using a RIP-chip assays (RNA-immunoprecipitation on microarrays), has shown that HP1 associates with the transcripts of more than one hundred euchromatic genes and interacts with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) that are known to be involved in RNA processing. By these results, HP1 seems to be part of a complex that stabilizes RNA transcripts. Though previously unsuspected, it was also found that HP1-interacting hnRNPs have a functional role in heterochromatin formation. These proteins bind heterochromatin and are dominant suppressors of position effect variegation. Taken together, the results in the paper by Piacentini et al. open a window on a possible new conceptual landscape in which similar epigenetic mechanisms could have a significant role, both in the metabolism of RNA transcripts and in heterochromatin formation, producing opposite functional effects. These data seem to establish a functional link between euchromatin and heterochromatin.","329":"Drosophila muscleblind (mbl), the ortholog of human Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) gene involved in Myotonic Dystrophy (DM), gives raise to protein isoforms MblA to G. The specific functions and subcellular distribution of isoforms are still largely unknown. To overcome the lack of isoform-specific antibodies we generated transgenic flies that express a GFP:MblC fusion protein under the control of the Gal4\/UAS system. The reporter fusion protein was able to functionally complement mbl loss of function mutations, demonstrating activity, and accumulated predominantly in adult muscle nuclei. The fluorescent nature of the reporter makes it appropriate for live imaging detection of MblC protein isoform.","330":"During exocytosis, classical and amino acid neurotransmitters are released from the lumen of synaptic vesicles to allow signaling at the synapse. The storage of neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles and other types of secretory vesicles requires the activity of specific vesicular transporters. Glutamate and monoamines such as dopamine are packaged by VGLUTs and VMATs respectively. Changes in the localization of either protein have the potential to up- or down regulate neurotransmitter release, and some of the mechanisms for sorting these proteins to secretory vesicles have been investigated in cultured cells in vitro. We have used Drosophila molecular genetic techniques to study vesicular transporter trafficking in an intact organism and have identified a motif required for localizing Drosophila VMAT (DVMAT) to synaptic vesicles in vivo. In contrast to DVMAT, large deletions of Drosophila VGLUT (DVGLUT) show relatively modest deficits in localizing to synaptic vesicles, suggesting that DVMAT and DVGLUT may undergo different modes of trafficking at the synapse. Further in vivo studies of DVMAT trafficking mutants will allow us to determine how changes in the localization of vesicular transporters affect the nervous system as a whole and complex behaviors mediated by aminergic circuits.","331":"Folic acid is a vitamin for probably all animals. When converted to folate forms, it is used in DNA synthesis and amino acid metabolism. Literature suggests insects must consume folates, folates do not affect others, is a toxin for some, and that a few insects synthesize it. It has been reported that Drosophila melanogaster does not consistently need dietary folate because it can synthesize it. This seems unlikely since animals generally lack this ability. More likely, folates thought to have been made by the fly came from microbial symbionts. We aimed to clarify how dietary folic acid affects fitness and development in fruit flies and whether flies may receive folates from microbial symbionts. We found larvae were more viable and developed faster with increasing dietary folic acid, with the surprising exception that larvae fed nearly-zero folic acid developed faster. Their body folate levels did not significantly differ from those that consumed up to 600 times more folic acid. However, these flies fed little folate only achieved normal body folate levels and development times when antibiotics were excluded from the diet. When flies consumed near-zero folates with antibiotics, their body folate levels decreased and development was prolonged. An assay for the endosymbiont Wolbachia in flies used to generate the experimental flies did not show presence of these bacteria. Our data suggest D. melanogaster can harbor unknown bacterial symbiont(s) that provide essential folates to their host when it is scarce in the diet, allowing the fruit fly to maintain growth and development.","332":"A key goal of developmental biology is to understand the mechanisms that coordinate organ growth. It has long been recognized that the genes that control apico-basal cell polarity also regulate tissue growth. How loss of cell polarity contributes to tissue overgrowth has been the subject of much speculation. Do loss-of-function mutations in cell polarity regulators result in secondary effects that globally deregulate cell proliferation, or do these genes specifically control growth pathways? Three recent papers have shown that the apico-basal polarity determinants Lgl\/aPKC and Crb regulate tissue growth independently of their roles in cell polarity and coordinately regulate cell proliferation and cell death via the Salvador\/Warts\/Hippo (SWH) pathway. Lgl\/aPKC are required for the correct localization of Hippo (Hpo)\/Ras associated factor (RASSF), while Crb regulates the levels and localization of Expanded (Ex), indicating that cell polarity determinants modify SWH pathway activity by distinct mechanisms. Here, we review the key data that support these conclusions, highlight remaining questions and speculate on the underlying mechanisms by which the cell polarity complexes interact with the SWH pathway. Understanding the interactions between cell polarity regulators and the SWH pathway will improve our knowledge of how epithelial organization and tissue growth are coordinated during development and perturbed in disease states such as cancer.","333":"Gamete development requires a coordinated soma-germ line interaction that ensures renewal and differentiation of germline and somatic stem cells. The physical contact between the germline and somatic cell populations is crucial because it allows the exchange of diffusible signals among them. The tumor suppressor gene discs large (dlg) encodes a septate junction protein with functions in epithelial cell polarity, asymmetric neuroblast division and formation of neuromuscular junctions. Our recent work reveals a new role of dlg in the Drosophila testis, as mutations in dlg lead to testis defects and cell death. Dlg is required throughout spermatogenesis in the somatic lineage and its localization changes from a uniform distribution along the plasma membrane of somatic cells in the testis apex, to a restricted localization on the distally located somatic cell in growing cysts. The extensive defects in dlg testis underline the importance of the somatic cells in the establishment and maintenance of the male stem cell niche and somatic cell differentiation. Here, we discuss our latest findings on the role of dlg in the Drosophila testis, supporting the view that junction proteins are dynamic structures, which can provide guiding cues to recruit scaffold proteins or other signaling molecules.","334":"Scribbler was identified as a genetic modifier of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene Merlin. Loss of Merlin results in hyperplasia in a number of different epithelial tissues including the wing and eye imaginal discs, however loss of scribbler does not. The lack of an overt proliferation sbb phenotype has complicated the mechanistic link between sbb and Merlin. Scribbler encodes two novel transcriptional repressors which function in numerous processes including axon guidance and pattern formation within the wing. While the two sbb isoforms have some redundant functions over-expression of two sbb isoforms within the wing show distinct and opposite effects. Over-expression of the smaller SbbA isoform results in a larger wing, while over-expression of larger SbbB isoform results in a smaller wing with defects in venation. Co-expression of sbb isoforms ameliorates the effects of expression of either isoform alone, suggesting that a balance between the express of each scribbler isoform is required to ensure proper size of the wing.","335":"The expression of toxic viral proteins for the purpose of eliminating distinct populations of cells, while leaving the rest of an organism unaffected, is a valuable method for analyzing development. Using the Gal4-UAS system, we employed the M2(H37A) toxic ion channel of the influenza-A virus to selectively ablate the Drosophila eye-antennal imaginal discs, hemocytes, dorsal vessel and nervous tissue, and comparatively monitored the effects of expressing the apoptosis-promoting protein Reaper in identical cell populations. In this report, we demonstrate the effectiveness of M2(H37A)-mediated ablation as a new means to selectively eliminate cells of interest during Drosophila development.","336":"Circadian clocks keep time in the digestive, circulatory, reproductive, excretory and nervous systems even in absence of external cues. Central oscillators in the brain control locomotor activity of organisms ranging from fruit flies to man, but the functions of the clocks in peripheral nervous system are not well understood. The presence of autonomous peripheral oscillators in the major taste organ of Drosophila, the proboscis, prompted us to test whether gustatory responses are under control of the circadian clock. We find that synchronous rhythms in physiological and behavioral responses to attractive and aversive tastants are driven by oscillators in gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs); primary sensory neurons that carry taste information from the proboscis to the brain. During the middle of the night, high levels of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GPRK2) in the GRNs suppresses tastant-evoked responses. Flies with disrupted gustatory clocks are hyperphagic and hyperactive, recapitulating behaviors typically seen under the stress of starvation. Temporal plasticity in innate behaviors should offer adaptive advantages to flies. In this Extra View article we discuss how oscillators inside GRNs regulate responsiveness to tastants and influence feeding, metabolism and general activity.","337":"The steroid 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20-HE) and the sesquiterpenoid Juvenile Hormone (JH) coordinate insect life stage transitions. 20-HE exerts these effects by the sequential induction of response genes. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans hormones also play a role in such transitions, but notably, microRNA such as let-7 and lin-4 have likewise been found to help order developmental steps. Little is known about the corresponding function of homologous microRNA in Drosophila melanogaster, and the way microRNA might be regulated by 20-HE in the fly is ambiguous. Here we used Drosophila S2 cells to analyze the effects of 20-HE on D. melanogaster microRNA let-7 and miR-125, the homolog of lin-4. The induction by 20-HE of let-7 and miR-125 in S2 cells is inhibited by RNAi knockdown of the ecdysone receptor and, as previously shown, by knockdown of its cofactor broad-complex C. To help resolve the currently ambiguous role of 20-HE in the control of microRNA, we show that nanomolar concentrations of 20-HE primes cells to subsequently express microRNA when exposed to micromolar levels of 20-HE. We then explore the role microRNA plays in the established relationship between 20-HE and the induction of innate immunity. We show that the 3'UTR of the antimicrobial peptide diptericin has a let-7 binding site and that let-7 represses translation from this site. We conclude that 20-HE facilitates the initial expression of innate immunity while it simultaneously induces negative regulation via microRNA control of antimicrobial peptide translation.","338":"A long standing question in developmental biology is how morphogen gradients establish positional information during development. Although the existence of gradients and their role in developmental patterning is no longer in doubt, the ability of cells to respond to different morphogen concentrations has been controversial. In the Drosophila wing disc, Hedgehog (Hh) forms a concentration gradient along the anterior-posterior axis and establishes at least three different gene expression patterns. In a recent study, we challenged the prevailing idea that Hh establishes positional information in a dose-dependent manner and proposed a model in which dynamics of the gradient, resulting from the Hh gene network architecture, determines pattern formation in the wing disc. In this Extra View, we discuss further the methodology used in this study, highlight differences between this and other models of developmental patterning, and also present some questions that remain to be answered in this system.","339":null,"340":"Visual fixation and locomotor activity are two important behavioral properties utilized by flies when they approach a landmark. Although previous studies in Drosophila have revealed that the mushroom bodies (Mbs) and the central complex (CC) were regulatory centers for these behaviors, the specific neurons involved still remain largely unknown. We tested visual fixation behavior and locomotor activity of flies in a simple choice assay, Buridan's paradigm, using the GAL4\/UAS system to express tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC) in adult neurons specifically. Although we explored a variety of mushroom body and central complex-labeling lines, we found that only four GAL4 lines (104y-GAL4, 121y-GAL4, 154y-GAL4 and 210y-GAL4) could produce significant defects in fixation as well as decrease locomotor activity following adult induction of TeTxLC. This suggests a more complex circuit is involved in controlling these behaviors than previously thought. Expression patterns of the GAL4 lines in the central nervous system provide the some clues to which neurons might be involved in this neural circuit.","341":"Recombination restriction between evolving sex chromosomes leads to the degeneration of the chromosome that is present only in the heterogametic sex (the Y chromosome in XY species). The evolutionary forces driving Y chromosome degeneration, however, are still under debate and include positive and negative selection models. In a recent study, we showed that the rate of accumulation of loss-of-function mutations on the neo-Y chromosome of Drosophila miranda is compatible with the process of Muller's ratchet, the stochastic loss of the best mutational class of individuals from a small asexual population. Purifying selection at amino acid sites can accelerate the ratchet, and the speed of degeneration depends on the number of genes still present on the evolving Y chromosome. Our study shows that Y chromosome degeneration does not require the action of selective sweeps at linked sites, and can take place under realistic parameters of purifying selection only.","342":"Textbook drawings of human anatomy illustrate the diversity of body muscles that are essential for coordinated movements. The genetic and molecular bases of this muscle diversity remain, however, largely unknown. The rather simple Drosophila larval musculature--every (hemi)-segment of the Drosophila larva contains about 30 different somatic muscles, each composed of a single multinucleate syncitial fibre--makes it an ideal model to study this process. Each muscle displays its own identity which can be described as its specific position and orientation with respect to the dorso-ventral (D\/V) and antero-posterior (A\/P) axes, size (number of nuclei), attachment sites to the epidermis and innervations. Muscle specification is a multi-step process. Each muscle is seeded by a founder cell (FC). FCs display the unique property of being able to undergo multiple rounds of fusion with fusion competent myoblasts (FCMs). The current view is that muscle identity reflects the expression by each FC of a specific combination of \"identity\" transcription factors (iTFs) (reviews by [4, 5]). The transcriptional identity is propagated from the FC to nuclei of FCM recruited by the growing myofibre during the fusion process. FCs are born from the asymmetric division of progenitor cells which are themselves selected by Notch (N)-mediated lateral inhibition from promuscular clusters (equivalence groups of cells) specified at fixed positions within the somatic mesoderm; see Fig.2). The abdominal (A) A2 to A7 segments of the Drosophila embryo present the same muscle pattern, the thoracic (T) T2-T3 and A1 segments show variations of this pattern and the first thoracic segment (T1) and the eighth abdominal segment (A8) present fewer and more diversified muscles. While it is has long been shown that this diversification of the muscle pattern is determined by the autonomous function of homeotic genes in the mesoderm, the step at which segment-specific information carried by Hox proteins is integrated into the muscle specification process remained unknown.","343":"We developed a novel assay to examine social interactions in Drosophila and, as a first attempt, apply it here at examining the behavior of Drosophila Fragile X Mental Retardation gene (dfmr1) mutants. Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of single gene intellectual disability (ID) and is frequently associated with autism. Our results suggest that dfmr1 mutants are less active than wild-type flies and interact with each other less often. In addition, mutants for one allele of dfmr1, dfmr1(B55), are more likely to come in close contact with a wild-type fly than another dfmr1(B55) mutant. Our results raise the possibility of defective social expression with preserved receptive abilities. We further suggest that the assay may be applied in a general strategy of examining endophenoypes of complex human neurological disorders in Drosophila, and specifically in order to understand the genetic basis of social interaction defects linked with ID.","344":"The structure of chromatin in eukaryotes exerts significant influences on many DNA related processes, including transcription, replication, recombination and repair. A useful tool for mapping chromatin structure is micrococcal nuclease (MNase), which induces double-strand breaks within nucleosome linker regions, and with more extensive digestion, single-strand nicks within the nucleosome itself. Many studies, carried out largely with microbes and cell cultures, have used MNase to determine the positions of nucleosomes within a region of DNA to identify dynamic changes induced during gene regulation. To measure similar processes in a developmental context, we turned to a tractable model system, the Drosophila embryo. Here we describe a protocol that enables MNase mapping of the enhancer chromatin structure in the embryo, and show how it can be used to identify structural changes on a cis-regulatory element targeted by the Knirps repressor.","345":"The subdivision of proliferating tissues into groups of non-intermingling sets of cells, termed compartments, is a common process of animal development. Signaling between adjacent compartments induces the local expression of morphogens that pattern the surrounding tissue. Sharp and straight boundaries between compartments stabilize the source of such morphogens during tissue growth and, thus, are of crucial importance for pattern formation. Signaling pathways required to maintain compartment boundaries have been identified, yet the physical mechanisms that maintain compartment boundaries remained elusive. Recent data now show that a local increase in actomyosin-based mechanical tension on cell bonds is vital for maintaining compartment boundaries in Drosophila.","346":"Proper activation of the Ras\/MAPK pathway is broadly required during development, and in many cases, signal transduction downstream of the receptor is linear. Thus, different mechanisms exist to properly regulate the large number of specific developmental outputs that are required by the activation of this pathway. Previously, we have reported a regulated cytoplasmic sequestration of phosphorylated MAPK (pMAPK) in developing Drosophila compound eyes and wings \"called MAPK Cytoplasmic Hold\". In the developing wing, we have shown that cytoplasmic hold promotes the differentiation of wing vein tissue, while pMAPK nuclear translocation regulates growth and division. We had also suggested that the Ras pathway signals for inducing cell growth and cell division split upstream of the nuclear translocation of MAPK itself. Here, we further refine the role of MAPK in Drosophila. We report evidence that suggests, for the first time, that the phosphorylation of MAPK is itself another step in the regulation of cell growth and division in both Drosophila wing and eye cells. We show that inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation, or pMAPK nuclear translocation, is sufficient to block cell growth, but not cell division. These data suggest that non-phosphorylated MAPK is sufficient to induce cell division, but not cell growth, once inside the nucleus of the cell.","347":"Here we investigate the structural and functional basis of the interactions between Notch and Wingless signalling in Drosophila. Using yeast-two-hybrid and pull-down assays we show that Notch can bind directly a form of Dishevelled that is stabilized upon Wingless signalling. Moreover, we show that the mechanism by which Wingless signalling is able to downregulate Notch is by promoting its ligand-independent traffic to a compartment where it is degraded and that this activity depends on Dishevelled.","348":"Microtubules (MTs) are polar polymers that can facilitate asymmetric distribution of cell components, a process important for polarized cell growth. The highly elongated and polarized Drosophila mechnosensory bristle cytoplasm is filled with short MTs that constitute a significant component of the shaft cytoplasm. Inhibition of MT assembly affects biased axial growth in the bristle and highlights the importance of MTs for this process. We demonstrate that the vast majority of bristle MTs are organized in a polarized manner, minus-ends out. We also show that genetic disruption of the MT polarity affects the polar distribution of cell components and leads to an alteration in the biased axial shape of the bristle shaft. Thus, we suggest that the asymmetric organization of the MT population within the bristle cell shaft is necessary for the proper axial elongation of this cellular extension. We would also like to emphasize the benefits of using the bristle cell as a model for studying MTs and MT-binding proteins because changes to this cytoskeletal component result in easily recognized at the phenotypes.","349":"The expression and genome-wide mapping of epitope-tagged DNA- and chromatin-binding proteins in cultured cells has become a powerful strategy for epigenome characterization, especially in Drosophila, where cell lines derived from numerous tissues are now available. However this strategy relies on establishing transfected cell lines, which is time-consuming and introduces variability. Here we show that baculovirus-encoded proteins can be efficiently produced following infection of Drosophila cell lines of different types. Using chromatin affinity purification, we show that epitope-tagged proteins produced in baculovirus-infected cells provide genome-wide profiles of the histone variant H2Av that are comparable to those produced by plasmid-transfected cells. The ability to express multiple epitope-tagged proteins for epigenome analysis from a single culture, and to do this in a variety of Drosophila cell lines, significantly extends the range of epigenome analysis.","350":"Understanding the causes of aging is a complex problem due to the multiple factors that influence aging, which include genetics, environment, metabolism and reproduction, among others. These multiple factors create logistical difficulties in the evaluation of anti-aging agents. There is a need for good model systems to evaluate potential anti-aging compounds. The model systems used should represent the complexities of aging in humans, so that the findings may be extrapolated to human studies, but they should also present an opportunity to minimize the variables so that the experimental results can be accurately interpreted. In addition to positively affecting lifespan, the impact of the compound on the physiologic confounders of aging, including fecundity and the health span--the period of life where an organism is generally healthy and free from serious or chronic illness--of the model organism needs to be evaluated. Fecundity is considered a major confounder of aging in fruit flies. It is well established that female flies that are exposed to toxic substances typically reduce their dietary intake and their reproductive output and display an artifactual lifespan extension. As a result, drugs that achieve longevity benefits by reducing fecundity as a result of diminished food intake are probably not useful candidates for eventual treatment of aging in humans and should be eliminated during the screening process. Drosophila melanogaster provides a suitable model system for the screening of anti-aging compounds as D. melanogaster and humans have many conserved physiological and biological pathways. In this paper, I propose an algorithm to screen anti-aging compounds using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system.","351":"During Drosophila oogenesis, nurse cells undergo changes in chromosomal morphology, first from the polytenic form to a transient condensed phase known as the five-blob configuration, then into a diffuse polytenic-polyploid state for the remainder of oogenesis. The mechanism by which nurse-cell chromosome dispersal is regulated remains elusive. Mutations in several genes, including the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein genes squid (sqd) and hrb27C, the alternative splicing factor gene poly U binding factor 68 kDa (pUf68, also known as half-pint), and the germ-line-specific gene ovarian tumor (otu), that produce defects in nurse-cell chromosome dispersal also produce defects in oocyte polarity, suggesting a link between these two processes. Here, we characterize a novel gene named poly, which, when mutated in the germ line, disrupts nurse-cell chromosome dispersal, as well as localization of anteroposterior and dorsoventral determinants in the oocyte. We also show that poly interacts genetically with hrb27C and otu. We conclude that poly is required for nurse-cell chromosome dispersal and oocyte polarization in the Drosophila germ-line. In addition, our interaction data suggest that poly is probably a member of the characterized mRNP complex that mediates both processes.","352":"The complex Drosophila dumpy gene encodes a gigantic protein located in the apical extracellular matrix of epithelial cells. It has been shown to interact with several proteins notably during embryonic tracheal development. Here we examine Dumpy's interactions in vivo with mutations in 20 genes previously recovered in a screen for recessive lethals that generate blisters when somatic clones are produced by mitotic crossing over during wing development. Primarily using double mutants, we looked for both dominant effects of the wing blister mutants and the effects of blister mutant clones on dumpy expression. Sixteen of the mutants either suppressed or enhanced dumpy mutant phenotypes indicating the large Dumpy protein is a very important component of the epithelial extracellular matrix in the wing. Dumpy also interacts strongly with held out wings, which is involved in RNA localization and possibly alternative splicing.","353":"We report here the identification of a novel complementation group in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster named gang of four (gfr). Mutations in gfr disrupt patterns of cell differentiation in the eye and increase eye size through a proliferative mechanism that can be enhanced by a block in apoptosis. gfr mutant cells show several features of deregulated Ras\/MAP kinase activity, including reduced expression of the Capicua growth suppressing transcription factor and synthetically lethality with alleles of the Jun N-terminal kinase phosphatase puckered. gfr alleles also upreguate Notch activity in the eye. Thus, gfr alleles appear to elicit growth and patterning phenotypes via effects on multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the gfr alleles behave as gain-of-function lesions and overexpress the gene, bruno-3 (bru-3), which is located at the genomic region to which gfr lesions map. Genetic reduction of bru-3 suppresses phenotypes caused by gfr alleles, and like gfr alleles, overexpression of bru-3 depresses levels of Cic protein, indicating that overexpression of bru-3 is central to gfr mutant phenotypes.","354":"Bicoid (Bcd) functions as a morphogen during Drosophila development. Accordingly, bcd mRNA is maternally localized to the anterior pole of the embryo, and Bcd forms an anterior\/posterior gradient, which functions in a concentration dependent fashion. Thus, nuclei receiving identical amounts of Bcd should express the same target genes. However, we found that ectopic, uniform expression of Bcd causes anterior gene expression in the posterior with mirror image polarity, indicating that one or several additional factors must provide positional information. Recently, we have shown that one of these factors is Capicua (Cic), a ubiquitous maternal repressor that is down-regulated at the embryonic termini by maternal Torso, a key component of the maternal terminal system. Cic acts on Bcd dependent enhancer elements by repression and thereby controls the posterior limit of Bcd target gene expression. Based on these new findings, we propose that spatial control of gene expression in the anterior region of the embryo is not solely the result of Bcd morphogen action. Rather, it relies on a \"morphogenic network\" that integrates the terminal system and Bcd activities, providing both polarity and spatial information to the prospective head region of the developing embryo.","355":"Centrosomes act as major microtubule-organizing centers in most cell types. Their functions in interphase and mitosis are usually facilitated by their association with the nucleus. This may be particularly true in very large cells. Several papers report free centrosomes in syncytial Drosophila embryos. However, this phenotype often remains little explored. Yet, free centrosomes can occur by multiple mechanisms, including functional defects of the mitotic spindle, detachment of centrosomes from the nuclear envelope, centrosome inactivation upon DNA damage, and de novo centrosome genesis. Deciphering the cellular mechanism leading to free centrosomes upon a given perturbation such as a mutation or injection of a drug, can provide valuable clues regarding the nature of the molecular pathway affected. To this end, genetic and cytological tests, as well as time-lapse imaging are available. These studies can inform on the biology of centrosomes, cell cycle regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics. Here we briefly discuss what to make of free centrosomes in the fly embryo.","356":"In Drosophila photoreceptors, the multivalent PDZ protein INAD interacts with multiple signaling components and localizes complexes to the rhabdomere, a subcellular compartment specialized for phototransduction. Since this localization is critical for signaling, we conducted a genetic screen of the third chromosome for mutations that result in mislocalization of an INAD-GFP fusion protein. We identified seven mutant lines that fall into two complementation groups, idl (INAD localization)-A and idl-B. We show that idl-A mutants fail to complement with chaoptic (chp) mutants. Since chaoptin is a structural component of the rhabdomere, mislocalization of INAD may be a secondary effect of the retinal degeneration in chp and idl-A mutants. Genetic complementation and DNA sequencing reveal that the two idl-B mutants represent new alleles of trp, a gene encoding the major light-activated channel. The molecular change in each allele affects a highly conserved residue in either an ankyrin domain on the N-terminus or in the S6 transmembrane domain of TRP. These changes lead to the loss of TRP protein. TRP has previously been shown to anchor INAD in the rhabdomeres, therefore the independent identification of two trp alleles validates our screen for INAD-GFP localization. One possibility is that a limited number of proteins are required for localizing INAD-signaling complexes. A similar screen of the X and second chromosomes may be required to find the remaining players involved.","357":"The innate immune response was once considered to be a limited set of responses that aims to contain an infection by primitive \"ingest and kill\" mechanisms, thus giving the host time to mount a more specific humoral and cellular immune response. It is now known that the innate immune response is a complex integrated response involving multiple players that work together to eliminate the pathogen. The fruit fly has been a great model to decipher various aspects of the immune response of invertebrates, including the transcriptional regulation of the antimicrobial genes during systemic response. Various reports have recently shown that Drosophila can also be used as a model system to study the mechanisms that control epithelial immune responses and more specifically gut immunity. We will present here our current knowledge on the genetic control of antimicrobial peptides production and recent progress made in our comprehension of the mechanisms through which Drosophila gut epithelium tolerates commensal microbiota yet remains able to mount an efficient immune response to food-borne pathogens.","358":"Accurate perception of chemical signals from the environment is critical for the fitness of most animals. Drosophila melanogaster experiences its chemical environment through families of chemoreceptors that include olfactory receptors, gustatory receptors and odorant binding proteins. Its chemical environment, however, changes during its life cycle and the interpretation of chemical signals is dependent on dynamic social and physical surroundings. Phenotypic plasticity of gene expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire allows flies to adjust the chemosensory window through which they \"view\" their world and to modify the ensemble of expressed chemoreceptor proteins in line with their developmental and physiological state and according to their needs to locate food and oviposition sites under different social and physical environmental conditions. Furthermore, males and females differ in their expression profiles of chemoreceptor genes. Thus, each sex experiences its chemical environment via combinatorial activation of distinct chemoreceptor ensembles. The remarkable phenotypic plasticity of the chemoreceptor repertoire raises several fundamental questions. What are the mechanisms that translate environmental cues into regulation of chemoreceptor gene expression? How are gustatory and olfactory cues integrated perceptually? What is the relationship between ensembles of odorant binding proteins and odorant receptors? And, what is the significance of co-regulated chemoreceptor transcriptional networks?","359":"Transfer and processing of olfactory information in the antennal lobe of Drosophila relies primarily on neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and GABA, but novel studies also implicate a neuropeptide: the Drosophila tachykinin (DTK). DTK is expressed in local interneurons that innervate the glomeruli of the antennal lobe with varicose processes. Recently, DTK was shown to mediate presynaptic inhibition of olfactory sensory neurons by physiological and behavioral analysis.(1) That study drew our attention to the issue of alternative targets of DTK in the antennal lobe. Hence, in the present study, we interfered with DTK peptide and DTK receptor (DTKR) expression in local interneurons of the antennal lobe and studied the behavioral outcome of these manipulations. We show that DTKR is expressed not only in olfactory sensory neurons, but likely also in local interneurons. The behavioral consequences of interfering with postsynaptic peptide receptors are different from presynaptic peptide receptor interference. We discuss the possibility that the sum of pre- and postsynaptic interactions may be to modulate the dynamic range in odor sensitivity.","360":"We have generated wing disc compartments that contain marked fast growing M+ clones surrounded by slow dividing M\/+ cells. Under these conditions the interactions between fast and slow dividing cells at the clone borders frequently lead to cell competition. However, our assay suppressing apoptosis indicates that cell competition plays no major role in size control. We argue that cells within a compartment proliferate according to their genotype independently of each other and that their contribution to the final structure will depend solely on their proliferation rate. This model is supported by a computer simulation that predicts values similar to those found experimentally. Our results on the growth of M+ clones within compartments and on the expression of developmental genes like vestigial and wingless suggest the existence of a non-cell autonomous mechanism that functions at the level of the entire cell population. It measures the population size in each moment, determines the corresponding expression levels of developmental genes and establishes the time to arrest growth.","361":"One of the hallmarks of both memory and the underlying synaptic plasticity is that they each rely on short-lived and longer-lived forms. Short-lived memory is thought to rely on modification to existing proteins, whereas long-term memory requires induction of new gene expression. The most common view is that these two processes rely on signaling mechanisms within the same neurons. We recently demonstrated a dissection of the signaling requirements for short and long-lived memory into distinct sets of neurons. Using an aversive olfactory conditioning task in Drosophila, we found that cAMP signaling in different neuron cell types is sufficient to support short or long-term memory independently.","362":"In metazoan cells, transcripts that fold into double-strand RNA structures are endowed with the capacity to undergo A-to-I RNA editing, during which adenosines are catalytically deaminated to inosines by a class of enzymes known as ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA). In Drosophila, a wide range of coding mRNAs associated with signaling in the nervous system undergo A-to-I editing, and loss of editing results in extreme behavioral defects. Furthermore, there are indications that the precursors of endogenous small interfering RNAs also undergo editing. However, the mechanism by which A-to-I editing is related to ethology in Drosophila is unclear, as are the precise cell-types and developmental stages in which editing is most crucial. We have investigated these issues by altering small RNA production in flies lacking ADAR, and modulating editing levels in both time and space through a variety of transgenic techniques. Our results indicate that genetic re-coding in the nervous system is likely to be the primary pathway through which editing affects behavioral outputs, and further suggest that editing is required to 'fine-tune' neuro-transmission in the adult brain.","363":"The formation of complex tissues requires the assembly of distinct cell types that often migrate over long distances in order to interact with each other and establish a functional tissue. The establishment of the contractile tissue in the Drosophila embryo has been used as a model system in which to study how the interplay between distinct cell types results in a complex, functioning tissue. The Drosophila contractile tissue is composed of multi-nucleated muscle cells that are attached to individual specialized ectodermal cells, named tendon cells, at each end. The tendon cells are anchored to the cuticle external skeleton on their apical side and form integrin-dependent myotendinous junctions at their basal end. In order for the complex muscle-pattern to form, muscles must undergo several tightly regulated processes: They need to migrate towards their respective tendon cells, arrest migration upon arrival to the tendon cells and form integrin-mediated muscle-tendon junctions (MTJs) in an accurate manner that would guarantee appropriate muscle function.(1,2) The regulation of many of these events is still poorly understood, driving us to search for novel mechanisms that enable the functionality of the contractile tissue.","364":"A key event in fly limb development is the binary subdivision of the cardinal axes of imaginal discs by selector genes.(1-3) As an example, all limbs are partitioned into anterior and posterior compartments through the expression of engrailed (en) in posterior cells of imaginal discs and en expression is both necessary and sufficient to direct posterior instead of default anterior development.(4-8) In the leg imaginal disc, posterior en-expressing cells secrete the ligand Hedgehog (Hh), which in turn activates ventral Wingless (Wg) expression and dorsal Decapentaplegic (Dpp) expression in domains that bisect the imaginal disc.(9,10) Dpp and Wg act in concert to specify distal fates by inducing the expression of downstream genes including the selector gene Distal-less,(11,12) which is both necessary and sufficient for the development of the distal part of the leg.(13) In contrast, the dorsal (D) versus ventral (V) decision is mediated by antagonistic signaling between Dpp and Wg, with Dpp specifying D and Wg specifying V.(10,14-22) Recently, we have shown that the ventral specific T-box transcription factors midline(mid) and H15 are downstream effectors of Wg acting as selector genes that specify ventral fate.(23).","365":"Proteasomes are large multisubunit complexes responsible for regulated protein degradation. Made of a core particle (20S) and regulatory caps (19S), proteasomal proteins are encoded by at least 33 genes, of which 12 have been shown to have testis-specific isoforms in Drosophila melanogaster. Pros28.1A (also known as Prosalpha4T1), a young retroduplicate copy of Pros28.1 (also known as Prosalpha4), is one of these isoforms. It is present in the D. melanogaster subgroup and was previously shown to be testis-specific in D. melanogaster. Here, we show its testis-specific transcription in all D. melanogaster subgroup species. Due to this conserved pattern of expression in the species harboring this insertion, we initially expected that a regulatory region common to these species evolved prior to the speciation event. We determined that the region driving testis expression in D. melanogaster is not far from the coding region (within 272 bp upstream of the ATG). However, different Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) are used in D. melanogaster and D. simulans, and a \"broad\" transcription start site is used in D. yakuba. These results suggest one of the following scenarios: (1) there is a conserved motif in the 5' region of the gene that can be used as an upstream or downstream element or at different distance depending on the species; (2) different species evolved diverse regulatory sequences for the same pattern of expression (i.e., \"TSS turnover\"); or (3) the transcription start site can be broad or narrow depending on the species. This work reveals the difficulties of studying gene regulation in one species and extrapolating those findings to close relatives.","366":"A complex nervous system comprises two distinct cell types, neurons and glial cells, whose development, differentiation and function is mutually interdependent. Many studies contributed to uncovering the basic mechanisms determining neuronal and glial fate and we are progressing enormously towards an understanding of how neurons interconnect to form intricate neuronal networks. However, the mechanisms used to couple neuronal and glial development remain largely obscure. Here we advocate the usefulness of the developing Drosophila compound eye as a new model to study the complex relationship between glial and neuronal cells.","367":"One of the most important decisions in development is whether to be male or female. In Drosophila melanogaster, most cells make this choice independent of their neighbors such that diploid cells with one X chromosome (XY) are male and those with two X chromosomes (XX) are female. X-chromosome number is relayed through regulatory proteins that act together to activate Sex-lethal (Sxl) in XX animals. The resulting SXL female specific RNA binding protein modulates the expression of a set of downstream genes, ultimately leading to sexually dimorphic structures and behaviors. Despite the apparent simplicity of this mechanism, Sxl activity is controlled by a host of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms that tailor its function to specific developmental scenarios. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of Sxl regulation and function, highlighting work that challenges some of the textbook views about this classical (often cited, yet poorly understood) binary switch gene.","368":"The Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) is a primary source of Drosophila stocks for researchers all over the world. It houses over 27,000 unique fly lines and distributed over 160,000 samples of these stocks this past year. This report provides a brief overview of significant recent events at the BDSC with a focus on new stock sets acquired in the past year, including stocks for phiC31 transformation, RNAi knockdown of gene expression, and SNP and quantitative trait loci discovery. We also describe additions to sets of insertions and molecularly defined chromosomal deficiencies, the creation of a new Deficiency Kit, and planned additions of X chromosome duplication sets.","369":"The reproductive systems of male and female Drosophila have been well studied genetically and cytologically because of the importance of meiotic mechanisms in understanding inheritance and speciation. Recently, there has been increasing interest in proteomics of Drosophila melanogaster, because detailed and comprehensive gene annotations have made it straightforward to identify proteins analyzed by mass spectrometry. We have applied proteomic analysis to the male reproductive system with the aim of understanding sperm maturation not only during the process of spermatogenesis, but also during the movement of sperm from the seminal vesicle through the male reproductive system and into the uterus following copulation. In this article, we will provide an overview of the principles of recent proteomic technologies and describe a few proteomic profiles of the male reproductive organs.","370":"The beginnings of Drosophila as a model organism reach far back into the 1900s to Thomas Hunt Morgan's first fly room. The success of this system for the study of genetics is closely linked to the fact that the fly is amenable to complex genetic manipulations so that random mutagenesis screens can be easily performed. Nonetheless, current advances in genomics and in our ability to predict protein function emphasize the importance of mutagenesis methods that are not random, but rather give the researcher control over how the gene is modified. Gene targeting in Drosophila, developed almost a decade ago, makes use of the organism's own DNA repair machinery to exchange genetic information between a chromosomal target and an exogenous template. Here we discuss available targeting methods and recent advances that facilitate repeated targeting and open the doors to routine allelic studies.","371":"Gene replacement by homologous recombination is a powerful technique for generating mutations in Drosophila. while using this technique for the BEAF gene, we encountered non-targeted lethal mutations on the target chromosome that complicated the analysis of the BEAF mutations until they were discovered and removed by meiotic recombination. Subsequent experiments indicated that the gene-targeting method leads to a modest but significant three-fold increase in the rate of production of non-targeted lethal mutations. It is important to be aware of this phenomenon when using this method.","372":"Over the past two decades, a large collection of transposable elements inserted at various locations in the Drosophila melanogaster genome has been assembled. These transposons are frequently utilized in imprecise excision screens to generate deletions in genes of interest. In general, these screens involve genetic manipulations to combine a non-autonomous transposon and the appropriate transposase in individual male or female flies. DNA double-strand breaks are created via transposase action in both somatic and germline cells of these individuals and inaccurate repair events are recovered in the progeny. Because deletion-prone repair of transposon-induced double-strand breaks is rare, these screens generally require a significant investment of time and resources. We recently reported that conducting imprecise excision screens in mus309 mutant flies, which lack the Drosophila ortholog of the Bloom Syndrome helicase, results in an increase in both the number and size of deletions recovered. Here, we provide additional information for Drosophila researchers wishing to utilize this technique. In addition, we discuss how the general principle behind this technique can be applied in other contexts where double-strand breaks are being generated for the purpose of genome modification.","373":"Germ line imprinting produces parent-specific differences in the behavior of chromosomes or expression of genes. Epigenetic marks, placed on chromosomes in the parental germ line, govern classical imprinted effects such as chromosomal inactivation, chromosome elimination and mono-allelic expression. Germ line imprinting occurs in insects, plants and mammals. Several Drosophila systems display imprinted effects. In spite of this, many aspects of imprinting in flies, including the normal function of this process, remain mysterious. Transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks is a powerful force in genome regulation. Elucidation of the mechanism of imprint establishment and maintenance in a model organism, such as Drosophila, is thus of great interest. In this review we summarize the primary systems that have been used to study imprinting in flies and speculate on the origin and biological function of imprinting in Drosophila.","374":"Since the discovery of the small, gram-positive bacteria, Spiroplasma, as a sex-ratio distorting agent in Drosophila over 50 years ago, substantial progress has been made in understanding the relationship of this bacteria with its insect host. Thus far, Spiroplasma have been found as heritable endosymbionts in sixteen different species of Drosophila. In some species these bacteria cause a male-killing phenotype, where the males die during embryogenesis. In other species, however, Spiroplasma does not cause male-killing, and its fitness effects are unclear. Though recent research has identified multiple factors that affect the prevalence and transmission of Spiroplasma in Drosophila populations, much work remains to fully characterize this symbiosis. Spiroplasma is the only identified heritable bacterial endosymbiont of Drosophila, other than Wolbachia, and can serve as a useful as model for elucidating the nature of insect\/bacterial interactions.","375":"In Drosophila embryos, muscle fiber formation via myoblast fusion relies on essential contributions made by the conserved Arp2\/3 microfilament nucleation machinery. Two key nucleation promoting factors (NPFs), SCAR and WASp, have been shown to mediate this aspect of Arp2\/3 function. We have used these unique circumstances, to study the requirements and coordination of distinct NPF activities, within a common developmental setting. Our results suggest that, although operating within close spatial and temporal proximity, the two regulators of actin polymerization are used in a step-wise manner and perform separate functional roles. Our approach also allows us to assess the involvement of the Arp2\/3 machinery in formation of a distinct, fusion-associated actin structure.","376":"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is an essential regulator of embryonic development and a key factor in carcinogenesis.(1,2) Hh, a secreted morphogen, activates intracellular signaling events via downstream effector proteins, which translate the signal to regulate target gene transcription.(3,4) In a recent publication, we quantitatively compared two commonly accepted models of Hh signal transduction.(5) Each model requires a different ratio of signaling components to be feasible. Thus, we hypothesized that knowing the steady-state ratio of core signaling components might allow us to distinguish between models. We reported vast differences in the molar concentrations of endogenous effectors of Hh signaling, with Smo present in limiting concentrations.(5) This extra view summarizes the implications of this endogenous ratio in relation to current models of Hh signaling and places our results in the context of recent work describing the involvement of guanine nucleotide binding protein Galphai and Cos2 motility.","377":"In lower eukaryotes, such as A. thaliana, C. elegans, S. pombe and N. crassa, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is a required component of the RNA silencing pathway. Remarkably, even though robust RNA silencing occurs in Drosophila in response to exogenous dsRNA and siRNAs, no RdRP homolog has been identified in the Drosophila genome or in any other higher eukaryote characteristic of the known cellular RdRPs. We showed recently that the largest subunit of the Drosophila RNA polymerase II core elongator complex, called D-elp1, has RdRP activity capable of using unprimed or primed synthesis mechanisms to convert single stranded RNA templates into double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that can be cleaved by Dcr-2. Loss of D-elp1 inhibits both siRNA and dsRNA directed RNAi in S2 cells but does not affect micro RNA targeting. Transposon RNA levels also increase with the loss of D-elp1 while the corresponding endo siRNAs, critical for transposon suppression, are dramatically reduced and this is correlated with a reduction in transposon antisense RNA levels. D-elp1 associates tightly with Dicer-2, similar to the Dicer-RdRP interaction observed in lower eukaryotes. With the exception of S. cerevisiae, which lacks the RNAi machinery altogether, RdRP activity is conserved in the elp1 homologs from S. pombe to human. This commentary focuses on the importance and universality of RdRP in RNA silencing.","378":"Gain of function screens have being frequently used to search for genes affecting a particular adult character or developmental process. These experiments are made possible by the adoption of the Gal4\/UAS system to flies, and by the design of P elements bearing UAS sequences. We recently published two screens in which a large number of newly generated P-UAS insertions were crossed with Gal4 drivers expressed in the pupal veins and in the central region of the wing disc. From the data obtained in these and other screens, it seems that a gain-of-function phenotype is a rare occurrence observed only for about 5-8% of insertion sites. Insertions affecting the expression of signaling molecules were particularly enriched in the screens. In contrast, gain-of-function phenotypes due to insertions not belonging to this class appear to be caused by multiple protein-specific mechanisms that could only be unraveled after extensive analysis. We present some data concerning the overexpression of LamB1, a gene encoding the B subunit of Laminin trimers in Drosophila, and show that Notch protein subcellular localization and signaling is compromised in cells overexpressing LanB1.","379":"Decapentaplegic (DPP) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and -4 type ligands form a branch of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) superfamily. They play prominent roles in metazoan developmental processes as diverse as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and cell-fate determination. Maturation of the BMP2\/4\/DPP type proteins requires proteolytic cleavage of their proproteins by furin-type proprotein convertases (PCs). Even though cleavage of the prodomain is critical for signaling, much less attention has been paid to the role of proteolytic processing. Our studies suggest that the cleavage sites of BMP2\/4\/DPP type proteins have been diversified and can be categorized into at least four different types. These findings indicate that the cleavage sites in BMP2\/4\/DPP prodomains are tolerant to mutations acquired through evolution and have adapted to diversified environments among species. These results provide insights for further studies of evolution and molecular diversity. In this Extra View we discuss the evolutional variation seen in the sequences of BMP2\/4\/DPP type proteins.","380":"Developmental geneticists have spearheaded the synthesis of evolutionary and developmental biology, a.k.a 'evo-devo', leading to a wealth of recent insights about how morphological diversity has evolved. However, there exists a gap between these disciplines, and evo-devo has not benefited from an integration of the principles derived from population genetics and molecular evolution. In order to contribute to the remediation of this deficiency, we recently performed a study investigating how genes diverge among closely related species of Drosophila as a function of when they are expressed during development. We found that patterns of genetic divergence parallels morphology: interspecific divergence accumulates as development progresses. We also sought to test whether this positive gradient of divergence over ontogeny is best explained by purifying selection constraining the divergence of early-expressed genes or positive selection driving the evolution of those expressed later. Interestingly, we found evidence that both processes occur simultaneously. We argue that comparative genomics approaches, by juxtaposing gene- and phenotypelevel divergence, particularly among closely related species, have much to contribute to the ongoing evo-devo synthesis, complementing traditional genetics-based techniques with largescale screening analyses uncovering the mechanisms underlying developmental change.","381":"Cell fate determination in many systems is based upon inductive events driven by cell-cell interactions. Inductive signaling regulates many aspects of Drosophila compound eye development. Accumulating evidence suggests that the color sensitivity of the R8 photoreceptor cell within an individual ommatidium is regulated by an inductive signal from the adjacent R7 photoreceptor cell. This signal is thought to control an induced versus default cell-fate switch that coordinates the visual pigment expression and color sensitivities of adjacent R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells. Here we describe a disruption in R7 and R8 cell patterning in Scutoid mutants that is due to inappropriate signals from Rh4-expressing R7 cells inducing Rh5 expression in adjacent R8 cells. This dominant phenotype results from the misexpression of the transcriptional repressor snail, which with the co-repressor C-terminal-Binding-Protein represses rhomboid expression in the developing eye. We show that loss of rhomboid suppresses the Scutoid phenotype. However in contrast to the loss of rhomboid alone, which entirely blocks the normal inductive signal from the R7 to the R8 photoreceptor cell, Scutoid rhomboid double mutants display normal Rh5 and Rh6 expression. Our detailed analysis of this unusual dominant gain-of-function neomorphic phenotype suggests that the induction of Rh5 expression in Scutoid mutants is partially rhomboid independent.","382":"Although the molecular elements controlling cell cycle progression are well established, the mechanisms regulating how cell proliferation is triggered in response to extrinsic stimuli and how cell divisions change speed, particularly in stem or tumor cells or regenerative tissues, are poorly understood. One exceptional model system in which these events are precisely defined is Drosophila abdominal morphogenesis, in which stem-like histoblasts build the adult epidermis at metamorphosis by undergoing a series of sequential transitions from a non-proliferative to a growing, and finally to an invasive epithelium. We have recently uncovered in histoblasts an internal logic modulating cell cycle transitions that should constitute a reference paradigm for the study of other equivalent processes in stem cell, cancer or developmental biology.","383":"The reversal of cellular differentiation, or dedifferentiation, has fascinated biologists for many decades. While cells can be re-programmed extensively in culture, examples of in vivo dedifferentiation have recently emerged in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, allowing for analysis of this intriguing process under more physiologically relevant conditions. Studies suggest that dedifferentiation occurs not only during large-scale cellular regeneration, but also at low levels to replenish stem cells lost due to normal turnover. Our recent paper demonstrates a novel method to induce the dedifferentiation of lineage-committed stem cell daughters back into germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila testis. We also show a requirement for activation of Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) signaling in this process, and suggest that normally non-motile germline cells gain mobility and out-compete resident somatic cells for occupancy in the stem cell-maintaining microenvironment (niche). Here, we discuss what our findings reveal about stem cell competition and the capacity of various cell types to dedifferentiate.","384":"As has become tradition, this year's Southern California Drosophila Conference was hosted by the Developmental Biology Center (http:\/\/dbc.bio.uci.edu\/) at the University of California, Irvine. On September 11, 2009, speakers from institutions in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties presented their latest results in an informal and friendly atmosphere and had the opportunity to learn about new resources and facilities, establish collaborations, and network about job openings and training opportunities. The talks presented covered the use of flies to study a variety of topics including the mechanisms of action of human pathogens, human diseases, and aging and lifespan extension. In addition, attendees heard about aspects of Drosophila neuronal development, olfactory behavior, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. Some of the highlights of the meeting are summarized in this brief report.","385":"Starvation resistance (SR) is an important trait for survival of insects in the wild. We used recombinant inbred lines (RIL) to search for quantitative trait loci (QTL) in crosses between intercontinental inbred lines that were originally selected for heat-knockdown resistance. SR was measured as the time of survival under repeated events of starvation. SR was consistently higher in females than in males. Composite interval mapping identified one QTL region (cytological range 64D-66E2) on the left arm of chromosome 3 in males, and no QTL was found in females. Many candidate genes that were identified in previous studies of QTL for stress resistance are included within this QTL region. The QTL-allele that decreased SR was found in the line originating from the colder population (Denmark). We discuss our results with regard to multiple candidate genes, noncolocalization with thermotolerance QTL, and possible geographical variation.","386":"The Drosophila Pax6 genes, eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy), are expressed in both eyes and the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated that ey plays important roles in axonal outgrowth and differentiation of mushroom bodies (MBs), which are centers for associative learning and memory in flies. However, the functional significance of toy in brain development is poorly understood. Here, we describe the expression patterns of TOY, and show that TOY expression partially overlaps with EY expression in the embryonic, larval and adult brains. Mutations of toy perturb brain neuromere formation in the embryonic stages, and result in severe deformation of the MB lobes in pharate adult brains. Moreover, we also analyzed toy functions by gain-of-function experiments, and show that overexpression of toy results in degeneration of MB lobes. Thus, our results demonstrate the importance of toy in embryonic brain patterning as well as in post-embryonic development of the major brain structures such as MBs.","387":"The 10(th) CanFly (Canadian Drosophila Research Conference) meeting took place June 1-4, 2009 in Jasper National Park, west of Edmonton. This year's meeting has over 100 participants representing over 30 different research groups from every region of Canada, as well as several groups from the United States and Europe. Topics included ranged from Cell Biology, Signaling and Adhesion to Development, Gene Regulation and Neurobiology.","388":"","389":"Altering the cellular response to internal and external stressors is essential for survival, hence the process of translation is exquisitely regulated to rapidly change the proteomic profile upon physiological challenges. We recently reported that genetic and pharmacological manipulation of translation may be beneficial in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). Using two Drosophila models of PD, we showed that altering the regulation of protein translation is sufficient to ameliorate the phenotypes of these models, including neurodegeneration, mitochondrial defects and behavioral deficits. Previous studies implicating translation regulation in lifespan extension further implicates this as an important mechanism that can mediate cell protective pathways, not just for age-related diseases such as PD, but also of aging itself. As such, translation regulation represents a convergent target for therapeutic interventions. Here we highlight the therapeutic potential of translation regulation in disease and describe how determining profiles of protein synthesis may help in the fight for disease prevention and healthy aging.","390":"The application of phi C31 phage integrase in Drosophila for unidirectional and site-specific DNA integration was pioneered by Groth et al. in 2004, and quickly triggered a wave of innovative tools taking advantage of these unique properties of phi C31. Three recent papers have further developed novel approaches that combine the phi C31-mediated DNA integration with the homologous recombination (HR)-based gene targeting for the purpose of efficient and targeted modifications of Drosophila genomic loci. Despite significant differences, the general strategies are similar in principle in the SIRT (site-specific integrase mediated repeated targeting) approach by Gao et al. the IMAGO (integrase-mediated approach for gene knock-out) approach by Choi et al. and the genomic engineering approach developed by our group. All three use HR-based gene targeting to first implant a single or a pair of phi C31-attP recombination sites into the target locus. Flies carrying such targeted insertions of attP sites can then be used as \"founder lines\", in which modified DNA sequences (\"knock-in DNA\") can be repeatedly and efficiently inserted back into the target locus via phi C31-mediated integration. Thus, by carrying out the targeting experiments only once, one can then directly and efficiently modify the target locus into virtually any desired knock-in allele. Here we give a brief overview of the SIRT, IMAGO and genomic engineering approaches and propose a revised genomic engineering scheme in which a single ends-out targeting event will generate founder lines suitable for both recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) and single-site based integration of knock-in DNA.","391":"Neuronal growth cones migrate along stereotypic pathways to find and select their correct targets. Although it is widely believed that attractive and repulsive guidance molecules provide directional cues for migrating growth cones, it is still only poorly understood how these factors cooperate in a spatial and temporal manner. We have recently proposed that Drosophila motor axons recognize and follow a Sidestep-labeled substrate pathway from the ventral nerve cord to their peripheral target muscles. Sidestep (Side) is a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily and functions as a target-derived attractant. On motor axons, Beaten path Ia (Beat) is required to detect Side. In addition, Beat interacts with Side both genetically and biochemically, leading to the formation of heterophilic adhesion complexes in vitro. Since Side is expressed in sensory neurons, Beat-expressing motor axons fasciculate with sensory axons and use them as migratory substrates. In a similar process, motor axons contact a subset of Side-expressing glial cells, demonstrating that, during the period of axonal pathfinding, motor axons interact with all cell types that later will be the major constituents of peripheral nerves. Here, I discuss the idea that Sidestep-mediated attraction might represent the initial step for the controlled assembly of peripheral nerves.","392":"Insects have extraordinary sensitivity to volatile odorants. In the case of pheromone reception, sensitivity approaches the single molecule detection limit. The mystery of how insects detect volatile odorants has intrigued researchers for more than a century, but only recently have the molecular underpinnings been uncovered. In this review we summarize recent work that reveals multiple signaling mechanisms utilizing several distinct receptor families underlie olfaction in Drosophila. Some of these mechanisms have not been observed in other animals, suggesting they evolved relatively late along an evolutionary branch that ultimately gave rise to the insects.","393":"The Drosophila smooth gene encodes an RNA binding protein that has been well conserved through evolution. To investigate the pleiotropic functions mediated by the smooth gene, we have selected and characterized two sm mutants, which are viable as adults yet display robust phenotypes (including a significant decrease in lifespan). Utilizing these mutants, we have made the novel observation that disruption of the smooth\/CG9218 locus leads to age-dependent muscle degeneration, and motor dysfunction. Histological characterization of adult sm mutants revealed marked abnormalities in the major thoracic tubular muscle: the tergal depressor of the trochanter (TDT). Corresponding defects include extensive loss\/disruption of striations and nuclei. These pathological changes are recapitulated in flies that express a smooth RNA interference construct (sm RNAi) in the mesoderm. In contrast, targeting sm RNAi constructs to motor neurons does not alter muscle morphology. In addition to examining the TDT phenotype, we explored whether other muscular abnormalities were evident. Utilizing physiological assays developed in the laboratory, we have found that the thoracic muscle defect is preceded by dysmotility of the gastrointestinal tract. SMOOTH thus joins a growing list of hnRNPs that have previously been linked to muscle physiology\/pathophysiology. Our findings in Drosophila set the stage for investigating the role of the corresponding mammalian homolog, hnRNP L, in muscle function.","394":"We used the Illumina reversible-short sequencing technology to obtain 17-fold average depth (s.d. approximately 8) of approximately 94% of the euchromatic genome and approximately 1-5% of the heterochromatin sequence of the Drosophila melanogaster isogenic strain w(1118); iso-2; iso-3. We show that this strain has a approximately 9 kb deletion that uncovers the first exon of the white (w) gene, approximately 4 kb of downstream promoter sequences, and most of the first intron, thus demonstrating that whole-genome sequencing can be used for mutation characterization. We chose this strain because there are thousands of transposon insertion lines and hundreds of isogenic deficiency lines available with this genetic background, such as the Exelixis, Inc., and the DrosDEL collections. We compared our sequence to Release 5 of the finished reference genome sequence which was made from the isogenic strain y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) and identified 356,614 candidate SNPs in the approximately 117 Mb unique sequence genome, which represents a substitution rate of approximately 1\/305 nucleotides ( approximately 0.30%). The distribution of SNPs is not uniform, but rather there is a approximately 2-fold increase in SNPs on the autosome arms compared with the X chromosome and a approximately 7-fold increase when compared to the small 4(th) chromosome. This is consistent with previous analyses that demonstrated a correlation between recombination frequency and SNP frequency. An unexpected finding was a SNP hotpot in a approximately 20 Mb central region of the 4(th) chromosome, which might indicate higher than expected recombination frequency in this region of this chromosome. Interestingly, genes involved in sensory perception are enriched in SNP hotspots and genes encoding developmental genes are enriched in SNP coldspots, which suggests that recombination frequencies might be proportional to the evolutionary selection coefficient. There are currently 12 Drosophila species sequenced, and this represents one of many isogenic Drosophila melanogaster genome sequences that are in progress. Because of the dramatic increase in power in using isogenic lines rather than outbred individuals, the SNP information should be valuable as a test bed for understanding genotype-by-environment interactions in human population studies.","395":"Genetic studies in invertebrate model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster have been a fundament of cell and developmental biology for more than one century. It is mainly the lack of an efficient purification strategy which has hampered biochemical and proteomic analyses of gene products. We describe a novel affinity-tag, termed TagIt-epitope, specifically designed for affinity-purifications of multiprotein complexes from Drosophila. TagIt-fusion proteins can be efficiently purified using a monoclonal antibody and eluted under native conditions by competition with synthetic peptide encompassing the epitope. We demonstrate that this tag is suitable for the purification of proteinaceous assemblies such as the PRMT5-complex and RNA-protein complexes such as snoRNPs from Drosophila Schneider2 cells. Furthermore, we describe a novel approach by which this tag can be used to affinity-purify RNA-binding proteins from cell extracts. Therefore, the TagIt-technique or modifications thereof will be of great value in analyzing macromolecular complexes in Drosophila and also other invertebrates by biochemical means. In addition, RNA-peptide hybrid molecules may become a novel tool to purify RNA binding proteins.","396":"A spindle matrix has long been proposed to provide structural support for counterbalancing force production and a substrate for essential mitotic factors. For years the molecular identity of such a structure remained elusive. Recently a complex of nuclear proteins that reorganize into a spindle-like structure during prophase through metaphase that shows characteristics of a spindle matrix has been identified in Drosophila. We review how these results support the concept of a spindle matrix and discuss its possible function(s) during mitosis. Importantly, these molecules also appear to play critical roles during interphase in nuclear organization and function. Given that during cell division the entire nucleus undergoes a dynamic and tightly orchestrated reorganization, the reorganization of spindle matrix components during mitosis may comprise one phase of a continuum of \"nuclear architectural remodeling events\" that can be considered to extend throughout the entire cell cycle, even in the absence of a defined nucleus.","397":"The development of denticle rows on the ventral Drosophila embryo is a valuable system for studying the genetic control of epithelial patterning. During late embryogenesis, the apical surfaces of denticle-producing cells acquire a distinctive rectangular morphology with long anteroposterior boundaries, along which the denticles form, and short ventrolateral boundaries that stain strongly for adherens junction proteins. We observe that ventrolateral denticle cell boundaries are also convoluted, suggesting that the strong adherens staining results, at least in part, from the additional membrane in these regions. Embryos mutant for the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) Effector gene multiple wing hairs (mwh), or expressing dominant negative form of the small GTPase Rac1, have cells present between the normal denticle cell rows. These 'Interloper Cells' do not have convoluted ventrolateral boundaries with strong adherens protein staining, but have normal denticle placement, suggesting that adherens protein localization is not critical for denticle cell PCP. Based on these and other observations, we propose that denticle cell morphology arises from an epithelial stretch without junction remodeling. A crude mechanical model suggests that this mechanism can generate both the straight anteroposterior boundaries and the compacted ventrolateral boundaries typical of denticle cells. We discuss the significance of cell adhesion for denticle cell morphogenesis, especially given the established role for Rac1 in cell adhesion.","398":"The availability of whole genome assemblies from evolutionarily distant species and iterative search algorithms has boosted ortholog analyses. However, orthology per se is not a sufficient predictor of a specific function. In a recent study, we have combined bioinformatic analysis and biochemistry to study the evolution of the multi-component SMN (Survival Motor Neuron)-complex. This macromolecular machinery performs essential steps during the assembly of spliceosomal UsnRNPs. By orthology, many factors constituting the SMN-complex in humans developed early in evolution. Some were secondarily lost in Drosophila. Compositional investigation of the Drosophila SMN-complex by biochemistry revealed the absence of two predicted orthologs although the complex was functional. Their bioinformatical re-assessment showed rapid sequence divergence indicating loss of evolutionary pressure in Drosophila. As a tool to better understand the function of individual proteins in multimeric molecular machineries, we therefore advocate iterative combination of bioinformatics with biochemical or functional assessment.","399":"","400":"The genus Drosophila is one of the best-studied model systems in modern biology, with twelve fully sequenced genomes available. In spite of the large number of genetic and genomic resources, little is known concerning the phylogenetic relationships, ecology and evolutionary history of all but a few species. Recent molecular systematic studies have shown that this genus is comprised of at least three independent lineages and that several other genera are actually imbedded within Drosophila. This genus accounts for over 2,000 described, and many more undescribed, species. While some Drosophila researchers are advocating dividing this genus into three or more separate genera, others favor maintaining Drosophila as a single large genus. With the recent sequencing of the genomes of multiple Drosophila species and their expanding use in comparative biology, it is critical that the Drosophila research community understands the taxonomic framework underlying the naming and relationships of these species. The subdivision of this genus has significant biological implications, ranging from the accurate annotation of single genes to understanding how ecological adaptations have occurred over the history of the group.","401":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) downregulate the expression of their target genes by inducing translational repression and\/or mRNA decay. Under specific conditions, miRNAs can even activate translation of their target mRNAs. These processes occur via miRNA-protein complexes, or RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which contain Argonaute (Ago) subfamily protein as a core component. However, detailed mechanisms of miRNA-mediated translational regulation remain unclear. We recently reported that, in Drosophila, both of the two Ago proteins, Ago1 and Ago2, can repress translation of the target mRNAs, but by remarkably different mechanisms. Furthermore, we here show that Ago2, but not Ago1, can activate translation of the target mRNAs when they lack the poly(A) tail, suggesting that the length of poly(A) tail is an important determinant for the consequences of Ago2 function. This review focuses on how miRNAs regulate translation in light of these new findings.","402":"Previous studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that whether flies fight like males or females can be switched by selectively manipulating genes of the sex determination hierarchy in male and female nervous systems. Here we extend these studies by demonstrating that changing the sex of cholinergic neurons in male fruit fly nervous systems via expression of the transformer gene increases the levels of aggression shown by the flies without altering the way the flies fight. Transformer manipulation in this way does not change phototaxis, geotaxis, locomotion or odor avoidance of the mutant males compared to controls. Cholinergic neurons must be feminized via this route during the late larval\/early pupal stages of development to show the enhanced aggression phenotype. Other investigators have shown that this is the same time period during which sexually dimorphic patterns of behavior are specified in flies. Neurons that co-express fruitless and choline acetyl transferase are found in varying numbers within different clusters of fruitless-expressing neurons: together they make up approximately 10% of the pool of fruitless-expressing neurons in the brain and nerve cord.","403":"In modern functional genomics registration techniques areused to construct reference gene expression patterns and createa spatiotemporal atlas of the expression of all the genes in anetwork. In this paper we present a software package calledGCPReg, which can be used to register the expression patterns ofsegmentation genes in the early Drosophila embryo. The key task,which this package performs, is the extraction of spatially localizedcharacteristic features of expression patterns. To facilitatethis task, we have developed an easy-to-use interactive graphicalinterface. We describe GCPReg usage and demonstrate how thispackage can be applied to register gene expression patterns inwild type and mutants. GCPReg has been designed to operate ona UNIX platform and is freely available via the Internet at http:\/\/urchin.spbcas.ru\/downloads\/GCPReg\/GCPReg.htm.","404":"Drosophila have a variety of innate immune strategies for defending itself from infection, including humoral and cell mediated responses to invading microorganisms. At the front lines of these responses, are a diverse group of pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns. These patterns include bacterial lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, and fungal beta-1,3 glucans. Some of the receptors catalytically modify the pathogenic determinant, but all are responsible for directly facilitating a signaling event that results in an immune response. Some of these events require multiple pattern recognition receptors acting sequentially to activate a pathway. In some cases, a signaling pathway may be activated by a variety of different pathogens, through parallel receptors detecting different pathogenic determinants. In this chapter, we review what is known about pattern recognition receptors in Drosophila, and how those lessons may be applied towards a broader understanding of immunity.","405":"","406":"Drosophila ananassae and its relatives have many advantages as a model of genetic differentiation and speciation. In this report, we examine evolutionary relationships in the ananassae species subgroup using a multi-locus molecular data set, karyotypes, meiotic chromosome configuration, chromosomal inversions, morphological traits, and patterns of reproductive isolation. We describe several new taxa that are the closest known relatives of D. ananassae. Analysis of Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial haplotypes, shared chromosome arrangements, pre-mating isolation and hybrid male sterility suggests that these taxa represent a recent evolutionary radiation and may experience substantial gene flow. We discuss possible evolutionary histories of these species and give a formal description of one of them as D. parapallidosa Tobari sp. n. The comparative framework established by this study, combined with the recent sequencing of the D. ananassae genome, will facilitate future studies of reproductive isolation, phenotypic variation and genome evolution in this lineage.","407":"The endocycle is a developmentally specialized cell cycle that lacks M phase and consists of only S and G phases. Endoreplicating cells acquire high ploidies by multiple rounds of replication without cell divisions in order to increase protein synthesis to support growth and development of the organism. Endoreplication occurs in developmentally specialized cell types after they terminally differentiate. These cells include: ovarian nurse cells and follicle cells, most of the larval tissues in flies and the placenta giant trophoblasts and megakaryocytes in mammals. To date, studies of endoreplication have mainly focused on two aspects: Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-mediated controls to license and re-license replication origins in the absence of mitosis, and development or differentiation signaling pathways that mediate the transition from mitotic replication to endoreplication. The replication initiation machinery itself has not been much studied, partly because it has been generally considered to consist of the same set of factors used in mitotic cycle. Recently we reported a loss-of-function analysis of the Drosophila orc1 gene, which revealed that the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) is dispensable for endoreplication. This finding is surprising and rather provocative as it runs against the accepted dogma and is expected to stimulate discussion and interest in the identification of the molecular mechanisms of the initiation of endoreplication. What follows is a highly speculative view of how endoreplication occurs in the absence of the ORC and what advantage ORC-independent replication brings to the organism.","408":"The crystal-Stellate system is one of the best-known examples of heterochromatin-euchromatin interaction. The components of this system are homologous repetitive sequences clustered in three regions: 12E1 and h27 on the X and h11 on the Y. The symptom of a disrupted crystal-Stellate interaction is the presence of crystals in the spermatocytes of males lacking the crystal region. Stellate silencing is based on the RNAi process. Many modifiers of this system have been isolated and many of these are involved in RNAi. One of these modifiers is aubergine(sting); this is a \"gain of function\" allele in somatic tissues. Here we report the different behavior of two aubergine alleles with respect to the RNAi pathway: aub(sting) and a \"loss of function\" heteroallelic combination aub(HN)\/aub(QC42). An increased amount of Aub interferes with the correct functioning of the somatic yellow hairpin RNAi, whereas the Aub reduction does not. We also demonstrate the different behavior of these alleles on the I transposon silencing in ovaries. Intriguingly, neither of these aubergine alleles silence the Stellate locus. We can conclude that the crystal-Stellate system reveals different RNAi pathways even though much still remains to be done to completely explain the molecular bases of the crystal-Stellate interaction.","409":"Activation of the immune system is beneficial in defending against pathogens, but may also have costly side effects on an organism's fitness. In this study we examine the fitness consequences of immune challenge in female Drosophila melanogaster by examining both direct (within generation) and indirect (between generations) costs and benefits of immune challenge. Though passing immunity to offspring has been studied in mammals for many years, only recently have researchers found evidence for a cross-generational priming response in invertebrates. By examining both potential fitness costs and benefits in the next generation, we were able to determine what effect immune challenge has on fitness. In agreement with other studies, we found a direct cost to infection, where immune challenged females laid fewer eggs than unchallenged females in two of the three lines we examined. In addition, we found some evidence for indirect costs. Offspring from immune challenged mothers had shorter lifespans than those from unchallenged mothers in two of the three lines. Interestingly, we do not see any effect of maternal immune challenge on offspring's ability to overcome an infection, nor do we see an effect on other fitness traits measured, including egg size, egg-adult viability and offspring resistance to oxidative stress. While previous studies in bumblebees and beetles have demonstrated cross-generation priming, our results suggest that it may not be a general phenomenon, and more work is needed to determine how widespread it is.","410":"One basic condition of postmating sexual selection is that females mate more than once before fertilizing their ova. Knowledge of the frequency and extent of multiple mating in a given population or species is therefore important in order to fully understand the potential for sexual selection, in the form of sperm competition, sexual conflict and cryptic female choice. Surprisingly, there are only a handful of studies that have attempted to estimate the frequency of multiple mating in insects (including Drosophila) and none have made direct observations over extended periods of time. Here we use time-lapse photography to directly score matings in isolated pairs of D. melanogaster and show that multiple mating in the laboratory occurs at a high frequency but at comparable rates with wild caught females. We also find that the interval to remating rises approximately additively with each mating, indicating either an increase in female resistance or male reluctance to remate. These results suggest that the opportunity for postmating sexual selection in laboratory and natural environments are not dramatically different and that there may be a causal link between the rise in female mating resistance and the concomitant rise in the cost of mating. The method is easily executed and could be adapted to other insect models.","411":"Members of the highly conserved LAMMER family of protein kinases have been described in all eukaryotes. LAMMER kinases possess markedly similar peptide motifs in their kinase catalytic subdomains that are responsible for phosphotransfer and substrate interaction, suggesting that family members serve similar functions in widely diverged species. This hypothesis is supported by their phosphorylation of SR and SR-related proteins in diverged species. Here we describe a 3-dimensional homology model of the catalytic domain of DOA, a representative LAMMER kinase, encoded by the Drosophila locus Darkener of apricot (Doa). Homology modeling of DOA based on a Sky1p template revealed a highly conserved structural framework within conserved core regions. These adopt typical kinase folding like that of other protein kinases. However, in contrast to Sky1p, some structural features, such as those in helix alphaC suggest that the DOA kinase is not a constitutively active enzyme but requires activation. This may occur by phosphorylation within an activation loop that forms a broad turn and in which interactions between the side chains occur across the loop. The fold of the activation loop is stabilized through interactions with residues in the C-terminal tail, which is not part of the conserved kinase core and is variable among protein kinases. Immediately following the activation loop in the segment between the beta9 sheet and helix alphaF is a P + 1 loop. The electrostatic surface potential of the DOA substrate-binding groove is largely negative, as it is in other known SR protein kinases, suggesting that DOA substrates must be basic. All differences between D. melanogaster and other Drosophila species are single amino acid changes situated in regions outside of any alpha-helices or beta-sheets, and after modeling these had absolutely no visible effect on protein structure. The absence of evolved amino acid changes among 12 Drosophila species that would cause at least predictable changes in DOA structure indicate that evolution has already selected evolved mutations for having minimal effect on kinase structure.","412":"From the moment an adult fruit fly ecloses, its primary objective in life is to disperse and locate the source of an attractive food odor upon which to feed and reproduce. The evolution of flight has greatly enhanced the success of fruit flies specifically and insects more generally. Control of flight by Drosophila melanogaster is unequivocally visual. Strong optomotor reflexes towards translatory and rotational visual flow stabilize forward flight trajectory, altitude and speed. The steering responses to translatory and rotational flow in particular are mediated by computationally separate neural circuits in the fly's visual system, and gaze-stabilizing body saccades are elicited by threshold integration of expanding visual flow. However, visual information is not alone sufficient to enable a fruit fly to recognize and locate an appropriately smelly object due in part to the relatively poor resolution of its compound eyes. Rather, the animal uses an acute sense of smell to actively track odors during flight. Without a finely adapted olfactory system, the fly's remarkable visual capabilities are for naught. The relative importance of vision is apparent in the cross-modal fusion of the two modalities for stable active odor tracking. Olfactory processing in Drosophila is shaped by ecological and functional forces which are inextricably linked. Thus physiologists seeking the functional determinants of olfactory coding as well as ecologists seeking to understand the mechanisms of speciation do well to consider each others' point of view. Here we synthesize a broad perspective that integrates across ultimate and proximate mechanisms of odor tracking in Drosophila.","413":"Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a highly conserved cellular process that has been intensively investigated in nematodes, flies and mammals. The genetic conservation, the low redundancy, the feasibility for high-throughput genetic screens and the identification of temporally and spatially regulated apoptotic responses make Drosophila melanogaster a great model for the study of apoptosis. Here, we review the key players of the cell death pathway in Drosophila and discuss their roles in apoptotic and non-apoptotic processes.","414":"As research in the biological sciences continues to advance at a rapid pace, it is increasingly important that the data be captured, standardized, organized and made accessible to the scientific community. This is the job of a biocurator. Here we describe the process of biocuration from our perspective as FlyBase curators.","415":"","416":"The Extracellularly Regulated Kinase\/Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (ERK\/MAPK) signaling pathway is a critical regulator of cellular processes in adult and developing tissues. Depending on the cellular context, MAPK cascade can act as a rheostat, a switch, or an oscillator. The highly conserved structure of the cascade does not imply a rigid function, as was suggested by the early mathematical models of MAPK signaling, and can instead produce a wide range of input-output maps. Given a large number of pathway components and modes of regulation, it is essential to establish experimental systems that will allow both manipulating the MAPK cascade and monitoring its dynamics. The terminal patterning system in the Drosophila embryo appears to be ideally suited for this purpose. Our recent experiments characterized dynamics of the MAPK phosphorylation gradient in the terminal system and proposed that it is regulated by a cascade of diffusion-trapping modules. Here we discuss a biophysical model that can describe the observed dynamics and guide future experiments for exploring the relative importance of multiple layers of MAPK cascade regulation.","417":"Drosophila melanogaster has been an historically important system for investigating the genetic basis of longevity, and will continue to be valuable as new technologies permit genomic explorations into the biology of aging. The utility of D. melanogaster resides in two resources: its powerful genetic tools as a model system, and a natural ecology that provides substantial genetic variation across significant environmental heterogeneity. Here we provide a review of the genetics of longevity in D. melanogaster, in which we describe the characterization of individual aging genes, the complexity of the genetic architecture of this quantitative trait, and the evaluation of natural genetic variation in the evolution of life histories.","418":"Mental retardation--known more commonly nowadays as intellectual disability--is a severe neurological condition affecting up to 3% of the general population. As a result of the analysis of familial cases and recent advances in clinical genetic testing, great strides have been made in our understanding of the genetic etiologies of mental retardation. Nonetheless, no treatment is currently clinically available to patients suffering from intellectual disability. Several animal models have been used in the study of memory and cognition. Established paradigms in Drosophila have recently captured cognitive defects in fly mutants for orthologs of genes involved in human intellectual disability. We review here three protocols designed to understand the molecular genetic basis of learning and memory in Drosophila and the genes identified so far with relation to mental retardation. In addition, we explore the mental retardation genes for which evidence of neuronal dysfunction other than memory has been established in Drosophila. Finally, we summarize the findings in Drosophila for mental retardation genes for which no neuronal information is yet available. All in all, this review illustrates the impressive overlap between genes identified in human mental retardation and genes involved in physiological learning and memory.","419":"mRNA localization, and translation that is regulated spatially and temporally, are key mechanisms in the execution of polarized developmental programs. For over two decades, the Drosophila oocyte has served as a valuable model to study these mechanisms. Genetic and biochemical studies in flies have greatly contributed to the identification and understanding of factors that govern RNA localization and translational control. Embryonic axis formation is mediated through the subcellular localization and precise translational regulation of four key determinant mRNAs during oogenesis encoded by oskar, bicoid, gurken and nanos. In this review we aim to summarize recent insights into the mechanisms governing the asymmetric distribution and translation of these mRNAs.","420":"Initially discovered in Drosophila, the Hippo (Hpo) pathway has been recognized as a conserved signaling pathway that controls organ size during development by restricting cell growth and proliferation and by promoting apoptosis. In addition, abnormal activities of several Hpo pathway components have been implicated in human cancer. Here, we review the current understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of Hpo signaling in development and tumorigenesis, and discuss how the Hpo pathway integrates spatial and temporal signals to control tissue growth and organ size.","421":"The melanization reaction, involving the synthesis of melanin to encapsulate pathogens, is a prominent immune response in Drosophila, the mosquito and other insects and arthropods. Biochemical studies with large insects have defined a basic model for how melanization is activated and regulated upon microbial infection. In this model, recognition of a microorganism triggers a serine protease cascade that activates phenol oxidase (PO), a key enzyme in the melanin biosynthetic pathway, and serpin-type protease inhibitors are involved in inhibiting the cascade. In the past few years, genetic studies in Drosophila have identified serine proteases and serpins that regulate activation of PO and melanization in vivo. These studies, along with molecular genetic analysis of melanization in the mosquito, have provided new insight into the role that melanization plays in fighting microbial infection.","422":"A biological understanding of memory remains one of the great quests of neuroscience. For over 30 years the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has primarily been viewed as an excellent vehicle to find 'memory genes'. However, the recent advent of sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate neural activity has meant that these genes can now be viewed within the context of functioning neural circuits. A holistic understanding of memory in flies is therefore now a realistic goal. Larvae and adult flies exhibit remarkable behavioral complexity and they can both be trained in a number of ways. In this review, our intention is to summarize the many assays that have been developed to study plastic behaviors in flies. More specific and detailed reviews have been published by us and others, reviewed in references 1-6. While our bias for olfactory conditioning paradigms is obvious, our purpose here is not to pass judgment on each method. We would rather leave that to those readers who might be inspired to try each assay for themselves.","423":"Physiology and behavior have historically been treated as separate subjects in the study of Drosophila. The latter is mentioned mainly in the context of neurobiology, while the former has been considered to take in studies of metabolism, cell biology and anatomy, among others. Of late, the line distinguishing physiology and behavior has become thinner, and this is exceptionally apparent in recent studies of nutrient signaling and of the regulation of feeding. This review represents a brief examination of the nexus between these intersecting fields of research in Drosophila. Other recently published reviews serve as complements to this one.","424":"Development of a drug and its safe therapeutic application necessitates using animal models for testing purposes. While testing with mammalian models is essential prior to approval for human trials, the use of invertebrate animal models that are amenable to molecular genetic manipulations provide experimental and biological advantages that can streamline the discovery and testing process. Among the benefits of a genetics-based approach is the ability to screen for genes\/proteins that may be novel drug targets, and the expedited development of genetic backgrounds that more accurately reflect a specific disease state. An invertebrate model may provide a more robust phenotype for screening, a situation that may arise when there is unanticipated genetic redundancy present in the mammalian model. Finally, the comparatively short generation time and fecundity of invertebrate models allows for increased experimental throughput. Together, these factors may contribute towards savings in time and cost during the drug discovery process.","425":"The Drosophila 12 genome data set was used to construct whole genome, gene family presence\/absence matrices using a broad range of E value cutoffs as criteria for gene family inclusion. The various matrices generated behave differently in phylogenetic analyses as a function of the e-value employed. Based on an optimality criterion that maximizes internal corroboration of information, we show that values of e(-105) to e(-125) extract the most internally consistent phylogenetic signal. Functional class of most genes and gene families can be accurately determined based on the D. melanogaster genome annotation. We used the gene ontology (GO) system to create partitions based on gene function. Several measures of phylogenetic congruence (diagnosis, consistency, partitioned support, hidden support) for different higher and lower level GO categories, were used to mine the data set for genes and gene families that show strong agreement or disagreement with the overall combined phylogenetic hypothesis. We propose that measures of phylogenetic congruence can be used as criteria to identify loci with related GO terms that have a significant impact on cladogenesis.","426":"Mutagenesis with ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) has been the standard for traditional genetic screens, and in recent years has been applied to reverse genetics. However, reverse-genetic strategies require maintaining a viable germline library so that mutations that are discovered can subsequently be recovered. In applying our TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) method to establish a Drosophila reverse-genetic service (Fly-TILL), we chose to screen the Zuker lines, a large collection of EMS-mutagenized second- and third-chromosome balanced lines that had been established for forward-genetic screening. For the past four years, our Fly-TILL service has screened this collection to provide approximately 150 allelic series of point mutations for the fly community. Our analysis of &gt;2000 point mutations and indels have provided a glimpse into the population dynamics of this valuable genetic resource. We found evidence for selection and differential recovery of mutations, depending on distance from balancer breakpoints. Although this process led to variable mutational densities, we have nevertheless been able to deliver potentially valuable mutations in genes selected by Fly-TILL users. We anticipate that our findings will help guide the future implementation of point-mutation resources for the Drosophila community.","427":"The 16(th) Biennial Meeting of the EMBO-Sponsored International Workshop on the Molecular and Developmental Biology of Drosophila was held in Kolymbari, Crete from June 23 to June 28, 2008. As in previous years, the weather was hot, the Mediterranean Sea was clear and blue and the presentations were exciting and illuminating.","428":"The in vivo analysis of Drosophila using genetics, with almost a hundred year history, has produced an immense body of knowledge about biology. In vitro analysis, while arguably the poor cousin to its in vivo relative, has a utility--in biochemical analyses and in cell-based screening, for example, with RNAi. A major block to the development of in vitro analysis has been the lack of an efficient genetic method to derive cell lines from mutant Drosophila strains. We recently discovered that expression of activated Ras (Ras(V12)) provides cells in vitro with both a survival and a proliferative advantage and hence promotes the generation of cell lines. In this addendum, we provide new data describing the genesis of seven cell lines corresponding to a rumi mutant, which demonstrate that the method can be used to derive lines and study genetic mutants in vitro.","429":"In order to better understand the pathology of aging in the fly we used standard techniques of surgical pathology to conduct a histologic screen of approximately 1400 adult male flies ranging in age from one to five weeks. We found that flies developed tumors of the testis and gut and that the incidence of these tumors increased with age. Aging is the greatest single risk factor for the development of tumors in the general human population. Here, we show for the first time that aging is also a risk factor for tumor development in flies. These findings in one of the world's best-studied and genetically tractable model organisms open up opportunities for deeper experimental exploration of the relationship between aging and neoplasia.","430":"The function of the conserved Drosophila Hippo signaling pathway has been shown to be required to limit cell proliferation. Several studies have identified different target genes of this pathway that could modulate this function. However, the ectopic expression of these genes cannot account for all of the hyperplasic and pattern defects displayed by Hippo signaling mutants. We have recently identified two new targets of the Hippo pathway, the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) encoded by division abnormally delayed (dally) and dally-like protein (dlp). The function of these glypicans is required to modulate the activity of different signaling pathways triggered by diffusible ligands. Thus, our results link the function of the Hippo pathway with the control of the activity of several signaling pathways required for the definition of the size and pattern of an organ.","431":"In this article we highlight some of the recently accumulating evidence showing that Hox genes are involved at different steps during the development of neural cell lineages to control segmental patterning of the CNS. In addition to their well-known early role in establishing segmental identities, Hox genes act on neural stem cells and their progeny at various stages during embryonic and postembryonic development to control proliferation, cell fate and\/or apoptosis in a segment-specific manner. This leads to differential shaping of serially homologous lineages and thus to structural diversification of segmental CNS units (neuromeres) in adaptation to their specific functional tasks in processing sensory information and generation of motor patterns.","432":"","433":"Stem cells are typically supported by the local tissue microenvironment named niche. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the Drosophila midgut do not seem to be typical: they are scattered along the basement membrane composed of extracellular matrix, and are not associated with any obvious cellular niches. In addition, regulatory mechanisms controlling ISC self-renewal remain unknown. Recently, we have obtained evidence to show that Wingless signaling is critical for ISC self-renewal. Wingless is specifically produced from the underlying circular muscles and is able to traverse through the basement membrane and reach ISCs, where it activates a canonical Wnt signaling pathway to promote ISC self-renewal. Our study reveals a muscular niche for ISCs and Wnt signaling as a conserved mechanism regulating ISC self-renewal from Drosophila to mammals. Here we provide a brief overview of our findings, and discuss future perspectives on the regulatory mechanisms underlying ISC self-renewal and differentiation.","434":"elfless (CG15150, FBgn0032660) maps to polytene region 36DE 5' (left) of reduced ocelli\/Pray for Elves (PFE) on chromosome 2L and is predicted to encode a 187 amino acid RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that is putatively involved in programmed cell death (PCD, e.g., apoptosis). Several experimental approaches were used to characterize CG15150\/elfless and test whether defects in this gene underlie the male sterile phenotype associated with overlapping chromosomal deficiencies of region 36DE. elfless expression is greatly enhanced in the testes and the expression pattern of UAS-elfless-EGFP driven by elfless-Gal4 is restricted to the tail cyst cell nuclei of the testes. Despite this, elfless transgenes failed to rescue the male sterile phenotype in Df\/Df flies. Furthermore, null alleles of elfless, generated either by imprecise excision of an upstream P-element or by FLP-FRT deletion between two flanking piggyBac elements, are fertile. In a gain-of-function setting in the eye, we found that elfless genetically interacts with key members of the apoptotic pathway including the initiator caspase Dronc and the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcD1. DIAP1, but not UbcD1, protein levels are increased in heads of flies expressing Elfless-EGFP in the eye, and in testes of flies expressing elfless-Gal4 driven Elfless-EGFP. Based on these findings, we speculate that Elfless may regulate tail cyst cell degradation to provide an advantageous, though not essential, function in the testis.","435":"In the past few years a number of fly labs have studied wounded Drosophila embryos,(1-3) larvae(4-6) and adults7 in an effort to uncover the molecular\/genetic basis of wound healing responses. The early studies in this growing field focused on the signature event of wound healing--the closure of the epidermal gap through cell migration. These studies showed that there is a conserved dichotomy between embryonic and postembryonic repair processes in flies and vertebrates: embryonic wounds heal through contraction of a supracellular actin pursestring assembled at the wound margin and postembryonic wounds heal through extension of cell processes and migration across the wound gap. Now, our group and others have begun to use these wounding assays to examine other steps of the healing process. Inflammation, the recruitment of hemocytes (blood cells) to the site of tissue damage, has been a particular focus of recent studies. This extra view article summarizes these recent findings on wound-induced inflammation, especially the curious dichotomy between modes of blood cell recruitment in embryos and larvae.","436":"Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is an essential morphogen in the TGFbeta\/BMP superfamily, which patterns fields of cells during multiple stages of Drosophila development, including the ovary and embryo. We have found that type IV collagens bind to Dpp and regulate its signaling during these two developmental stages. This article primarily focuses on type IV collagens and embryonic Dpp signaling to discuss aspects of the type IV collagen mutant phenotype in the context of additional data from the field. In addition, the restriction of Dpp signaling in the ovary by type IV collagens is described, as the differences between the embryonic and ovarian Dpp sources result in distinct effects of collagen IV proteins in the two systems.","437":"Protocols for both generation of mosaic clones and wholemount in situ hybridization detection of mRNA have led to an advanced understanding of Drosophila development. A simple means of combining these techniques for staining of imaginal discs would be useful, as it would allow for analysis of mRNA transcripts in marked mosaic clones. However, few researchers attempt such experiments due to the technical difficulty of simultaneously detecting clones and mRNA transcripts. Furthermore, maintaining the ability to use GFP-marked clones is desirable. However, typical Drosophila in situ hybridization protocols result in loss of GFP fluorescence. The method for double labeling of imaginal discs described here maintains the ability to identify mosaic clones, including those marked by GFP, while simultaneously allowing the detection of mRNA transcripts. The methodology described is technically manageable, robust, rapid, relatively inexpensive and of interest to many Drosophila researchers.","438":"Bioinformatics tools can be invaluable resources to Drosophila researchers; however, the sheer number of applications and databases can be overwhelming. We present a broad overview of common bioinformatics tasks and the resources used to do them, with a specific focus on resources for Drosophila. The topics covered include: Genome Databases, Sequence Analysis, Comparative Genomics, Gene Expression Databases and Analysis Tools, Function-Based Data and Analysis, Pathways, Networks, and Interactions; and finally, tools to stay current with resources and literature. We also present a compilation of URLs and short descriptions that correspond to the topics and resources mentioned in this review.","439":"With twelve Drosophila genomes now sequenced, there is a growing need to develop higher-throughput methods for identifying the functions of the many newly identified genes. Genetic transformation and RNA interference are two technologies that have been used extensively to facilitate gene-function studies in Drosophila melanogaster, to introduce genes or block the expression of endogenous genes, respectively. Both of these technologies typically require the delivery of nucleic acids into developing insect embryos, and virtually all studies to date have relied on microinjection as the DNA delivery method of choice. In this study, we describe the use of biolistics as a higher-throughput method of nucleic acid delivery. By bombarding dechorionated D. melanogaster embryos with 1 microm gold beads coated with P-element or piggyBac transformation vectors, we observed transformation frequencies (3-4%) that are comparable to those achieved using microinjection methods, but in only a fraction of the time required for the DNA delivery. Biolistic delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to a beta-glucuronidase (gus) transgene resulted in a significant (71%) reduction in gus transcripts in embryos and the RNA interference (RNAi) persisted through two successive larval molts, albeit at reduced levels. DsRNAs specific to four essential genes were delivered to embryos and resulted in arrested development and phenotypes that closely match that of null mutations. These results suggest that biolistic delivery of dsRNA into embryos could be adapted for high throughput RNAi screens of early Drosophila developmental genes.","440":"","441":"Although bilateral animals, including Drosophila, appear to have left-right (LR) symmetry from the outside, their internal organs often show directional and stereotypical LR asymmetry. The mechanisms by which the LR axis is established in Drosophila have not been studied well. We showed that two type I Myosin proteins play crucial roles in the manifestation of Drosophila handedness. Mutants of Myosin31DF (Myo31DF), which encodes a type ID Myosin, showed reversed laterality of the embryonic and adult gut and testis. Myo31DF was required in the epithelial cells of the embryonic hindgut, where its protein co-localized with actin filaments, for the correct handedness of this organ. Disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in the hindgut epithelium caused LR defects of the embryonic hindgut. These results suggest that the actin-based Myo31DF function is required for proper handedness. In contrast, the disruption of microtubules in the hindgut epithelium did not affect the laterality of this organ. We also found that the overexpression of Myosin61F (Myo61F), which encodes another type I Myosin in the hindgut epithelium reversed the hindgut handedness, suggesting that these two type I Myosins--Myo31DF and Myo61F--have antagonistic functions. We propose that the actin-based functions of type I Myosins play critical roles in generating LR asymmetry in invertebrates.","442":"A century ago a little fly with red eyes was first used for genetic studies. That insignificant fly, called at that time Drosophila ampelophila, revolutionized biology while becoming the model we know today under the name of Drosophila melanogaster. Since then its study has never ceased, but the field of interest has somewhat changed during the century. To caricature a little, today we essentially learn from Drosophila meetings that the fly has a brain! It is true that the fly is a tremendous model organism for neurobiology. But this fly is, in fact, an appropriate and recognized model for the whole of biology. Indeed, Drosophila meetings are exceptional opportunities to gather biologists of diverse backgrounds together. There we not only learn about the latest improvements in our field of interest, but surely appreciate learning another bit of biology. From this biological melting pot has emerged a culture very specific to the fly community. Thus besides neurobiology, cell biology and development, a diversity of other research fields exist; they all have their own place in the cultural and historical dimension of the \"drosophila\" model. Several communications from those diverse research fields were presented at the 8th Japanese Drosophila Research Conference (JDRC8) and are briefly covered here. We believe it more judicious to call the model \"drosophila\" without a capital initial, as the model has never really been limited to only the Drosophila genus. The vernacular name \"drosophila\" is currently used to designate any fly of the Drosophilidae family and we believe the term more appropriate than \"small fruit fly\" or \"vinegar fly\" to better include the species and ecological diversity of the model.","443":"Desiccation resistance and body mass were measured in multiple populations of each of four species of Drosophila: two desert endemic species (D. nigrospiracula and D. mojavensis), and two with more widespread distributions (D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura). While flies from the desert species were more desiccation tolerant, there was, in certain cases, significant variation in desiccation resistance among populations of the same species. A significant difference in desiccation resistance was observed between the sexes, females were more resistant than males, but this relationship was reversed when taking into account body mass differences between the sexes. The degree of observed within-species variability demonstrates that studies focusing upon differences between species can produce different conclusions if they rely on observations for only single populations of a given species. Our data also suggest the existence of multiple mechanisms for desiccation resistance.","444":"Cell competition was first described in imaginal discs of genetically-mosaic Drosophila. In extreme cases, cell competition can replace entire compartments with the descendents of a single cell. We recently identified five genes that are required by wild-type epithelial cells to kill neighboring Minute cells during cell competition. These draper, wasp, phosphatidyl-serine receptor, MBC\/DOCK180 and Rac1 genes, were each previously implicated in the engulfment of apoptotic corpses. The results draw attention to the active, killing role of engulfing cells during cell competition. Here we discuss the contributions of these engulfment genes to Minute competition in more detail, and compare Minute competition with competition between cells expressing different levels of Myc, or of Warts pathway genes. We also speculate about how cell interactions at clone boundaries may initiate cell competition.","445":"Axial patterning in Drosophila relies on the deployment of patterning proteins at specific regions within the developing oocyte. This process involves transport of mRNAs from the nurse cells to the oocyte, localization of mRNAs within the oocyte, and translational regulation of these mRNAs to restrict the final distribution of the proteins. Despite extensive analysis, the events of deployment are not fully understood and it seems certain that many contributing factors remain to be identified. We describe the development and application of a sensitized genetic screen to reveal such additional factors. Overexpression of Imp, a factor implicated in regulation of gurken mRNA, causes a weak dorsalization that can be enhanced by reducing the level of other factors acting in the same pathway. A collection of deficiency mutants was screened using this assay, leading to the identification of 5 genes that are candidates to contribute to axial patterning. Three of the genes were characterized in greater detail. The mushroom body expressed gene was implicated in axial patterning, with overexpression leading to a range of patterning abnormalities that can be explained by a more primary defect in organization of the cytoskeleton. Two mitotic cell cycle control factors, cyclin E and E2f1, were also implicated, raising the possibility that a mitotic cell cycle checkpoint may impinge on grk expression, much as meiotic checkpoints can alter expression of this gene.","446":"Many exciting new discoveries in the fields of cell biology and development were presented at JDRC8, including the molecular characterization of long-studied phenomena such as cell competition, the discovery of long-sought-after molecules such as nutrient sensors in higher organisms, and insights into the role of two of the 135 short ORFs in the Drosophila genome. This review will cover diverse topics roughly divided into four areas: cell biology and signaling, the cytoskeleton, transcription and cell fate determination and metabolism.","447":"The Genetics Society of Canada (GSC) held its 50th Anniversary Celebration June 18-21, 2007 in the New Residence Hall of McGill University in Montreal in conjunction with the 9(th) Canadian Drosophila Research Conference (CanFly), which is held in odd-numbered years. The meeting was a huge success with nearly 200 participants, and outstanding research presentations from all parts of Canada and beyond. The Canadian Drosophila research community is very vibrant: there are approximately 50 research labs in the country that work entirely or mostly in the Drosophila system, and a search of FlyBase for Canadian addresses yields a total of 248.","448":"Temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants are valuable tools to study the function of essential genes in vivo. Despite their widespread use, little is known about mechanisms responsible for the temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype, or of the transferability of ts mutants of a specific gene between organisms. Since ts mutants are typically generated by random mutagenesis it is difficult to isolate such mutants without efficient screening procedures. We have recently shown that it is possible to obtain ts mutants at high frequency by targeted mutations at either predicted, buried residues important for protein stability or at functional, ligand binding residues. The former class of residues can be identified solely from amino acid sequence and the latter from Ala scanning mutagenesis or from a structure of the protein:ligand complex. Several ts mutants of Gal4 in yeast were generated by mutating both categories of residues. Two of these ts mutants were also shown to result in tight and rapid ts reporter gene-expression in Drosophila when driven by either the elav or GMR promoters. We suggest possible mechanisms that might be responsible for such transferable ts phenotypes and also discuss some of the limitations and difficulties involved in rational design of ts mutants.","449":"Microsatellites show tremendous variation between genomes in terms of their occurrence and composition. Availability of whole genome sequences allows us to study microsatellite characteristics of fully sequenced insect genomes to understand the evolution and biological significance of microsatellites. InSatDb is an insect microsatellite database that provides an interactive interface to query information on microsatellites annotated with size (in base pairs and repeat units), genomic location (exon, intron, up-stream or transposon), nature (perfect or imperfect), and sequence composition (repeat motif and GC%). Here we present a snapshot of the distribution and composition of microsatellites in introns and exons of insect genomes. The data present interesting observations regarding the microsatellite life-cycle and genome flux.","450":"Cell signaling mediated by the Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted proteins is essential for metazoan development and its malfunction causes congenital disorders and cancer. The seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) transduces the Hh signal across the plasma membrane in both vertebrates and invertebrates but the underlying mechanisms remain ill defined. In Drosophila, Hh induces phosphorylation of Smo at multiple sites by PKA and CK1, leading to its cell surface accumulation and activation. Recently, we have obtained evidence that Hh-induced phosphorylation promotes Smo activity by inducing a conformational switch and dimerization of its carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail (C-tail). Furthermore, we provided evidence that a similar mechanism regulates mammalian Smo. We discuss how Smo conformational change regulates the intracellular signaling complex and how Smo transduces the graded Hh signaling activities through different conformational states.","451":"KASH (Klarsicht, Anc-1, Syne-1 homology) domain-containing proteins anchor the nucleus to the actin cytoskeleton or to microtubules. KASH proteins thus play pivotal roles in a variety of developmental processes where nuclear positioning is critical. Two KASH proteins have been identified in Drosophila: Muscle-specific protein-300 (Msp-300) and Klarsicht (Klar). Msp-300 anchors nuclei to actin, and has been reported to be essential for positioning of nurse cell nuclei during oogenesis, and thus production of mature ooctyes. Klar is required for positioning of photoreceptor and cone cell nuclei in the developing eye, which is critical for proper eye morphology. Here, we asked whether KASH domain-containing forms of Msp-300 are required for nuclear positioning in the eye, and we found that they are not. Moreover, in the course of this work, we discovered that contrary to previous reports, KASH domain-containing forms of Msp-300 are not required for viability, nor for oogenesis. However, we did find that Msp-300 has a function in egg laying, normally redundant with a function of Klar.","452":"","453":"Morphogen gradients provide unique positional information within a tissue. Cells that are sensitive to the concentration of the morphogen integrate this signal and develop an appropriately distinct cell fate. A morphogen gradient is usually generated by a restricted source and shaped by the speed of diffusion and stability of the signaling molecule. In addition, the availability of receptor and Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs) help to shape the gradient. We have shown that overexpression of Dally-like protein (Dlp) causes an expansion of Gurken distribution and a loss of cell fates which are specified by high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) signaling. In this article, we discuss how D-Cbl mediated Egfr endocytosis and the levels of Dlp affect the shape of the Gurken gradient.","454":"The 49(th) Annual Drosophila Research Conference was held in the sunny confines of San Diego. As usual, large numbers of Drosophila scientists working in fields as different as immunology and evolution descended on the venue. The meeting showed that the fly community is still vibrant and diverse even with the funding crunch at the NIH and the renewed rumors that Drosophila may have outlived its usefulness. This short review will focus on one session of platform presentations detailing the recent advances in the field of pattern formation. This session offered a variety of topics reviewing the formation of pattern in various tissues through diverse mechanisms. I will focus on early embryonic patterning through pair-rule genes, specificity of FGF signaling, and tissue regeneration.","455":"Proteins harboring a C-terminal KASH (Klarsicht\/Anc-1\/Syne Homology) domain, which attaches to the nucleus, have been identified in many different organisms. Two KASH proteins are known from Drosophila, Msp-300 and Klarsicht, the latter of which plays a role in nuclear migration during eye development. Here, we show that a complete deletion of Msp-300 leads to larval lethality. This lethality appears to be due to Msp-300 isoforms containing the N-terminal actin binding, but not the C-terminal KASH domain. Msp-300 and Klar are expressed during oogenesis and localize to the nuclear envelope of the germ line nuclei. However, neither Msp-300 single mutants nor Msp-300; klar double mutants cause defects in nuclear migration or anchoring during oogenesis. Germ line nuclear envelope localization of both KASH domain proteins depends on klaroid, the only Drosophila SUN domain homolog expressed in females. Like Msp-300 and klar, klaroid is also dispensable for normal ovarian development.","456":"Innate immunity is essential for the survival of organisms across the evolutionary spectrum. Drosophila is well studied as a model of innate immunity and has been instrumental in establishing principles of defense and gene signaling pathways that are shared with humans. Previous studies in Drosophila have not focused on differences between the sexes, and in this report we present evidence that it is essential to include differences between the sexes. Survival rates post-infection, after a fungal or bacterial infection, varied according to the combination of signaling pathway (Toll and Imd) and sex tested. We also found that antimicrobial protein gene mRNA levels for Drosomycin and Metchnikowin showed both similarities and differences between the sexes. These studies highlight the need to include both sexes in studies of immune function as well as the associated opportunities for advancing our understanding of immunity.","457":"We describe a data pipeline developed to extract the quantitative data on segmentation gene expression from confocal images of gene expression patterns in Drosophila. The pipeline consists of five steps: image segmentation, background removal, temporal characterization of an embryo, data registration and data averaging. This pipeline was successfully applied to obtain quantitative gene expression data at cellular resolution in space and at the 6.5-minute resolution in time, as well as to construct a spatiotemporal atlas of segmentation gene expression. Each data pipeline step can be easily adapted to process a wide range of images of gene expression patterns.","458":null,"459":"","460":"","461":"The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play essential roles during oocyte maturation and egg activation and are also active in somatic cell cycle regulation in many animals. In clams, starfish, ascidians, mice, and frogs, the species-specific timing of MAPK activity during oocyte maturation and egg activation correlates with the different meiotic arrest points of these various organisms. Furthermore, MAPKs have been shown to regulate the meiotic cell cycle in marine invertebrates and vertebrates. The initial trigger for egg activation in insects is different from that of marine invertebrates and vertebrates, and it was not previously known whether changes in MAPK activity accompany egg activation in insects. To examine the regulation of MAPKs during Drosophila egg activation and early embryogenesis, we quantified the levels of phosphorylated (active) forms of ERK, p38 and JNK by western blotting with antibodies specific to the phospho-forms of these kinases. Levels of phospho-ERK, phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK are high in Drosophila oocytes. Upon egg activation, levels of all these phospho- (active) forms of MAPKs decrease. Fertilization is not required for this decrease, consistent with the independence of egg activation from fertilization in Drosophila. The decrease in levels of phospho-MAPK occurs normally in embryos laid by sterile females mutant in the egg activation genes cortex, sarah, and prage. We present a model in which the decrease in MAPK activity is an intermediate step in the pathway leading from the calcium signal that initiates egg activation to the downstream events of activation.","462":"The enhancer of rudimentary gene, e(r), encodes a 104-amino-acid, highly conserved transcription cofactor. Hypomorphic mutations of e(r) show an enhancement of a hypomorphic rudimentary mutant wing phenotype. These mutants in a wild-type background are viable, fertile, and morphologically wild-type. Since the only mutant alleles were hypomorphic, it was important to isolate null mutations to determine if any other phenotypes might be associated with a loss-of-function of e(r). We utilized a marked P element, P{SUPor-P, y(+)}, located 895 bp upstream of the start of transcription of e(r) to generate nineteen deficiencies in the region. Deficiencies of e(r) enhance the mutant wing phenotype of a hypomorphic rudimentary allele, r(hd1). In a wild-type background, the deficiencies of e(r), unlike the hypomorphic alleles, have a low viability and females have low fertility. The expression of e(r) in the nurse cells of the ovary is consistent with the low fertility, and suggests an ovarian function for e(r). Deficiencies of CG15352, the gene directly upstream of e(r), are not associated with any obvious mutant phenotypes and present the possibility that it encodes a nonvital or redundant function.","463":"The availability of complete genome sequence information for diverse organisms including model genetic organisms has ushered in a new era of protein sequence comparisons making it possible to search for commonalities among entire proteomes using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Although the identification and analysis of proteins shared by humans and model organisms has proven an invaluable tool to understanding gene function, the sets of proteins unique to a given model organism's proteome have remained largely unexplored. We have constructed a searchable database that allows biologists to identify proteins unique to a given proteome. The Negative Proteome Database (NPD) is populated with pair-wise protein sequence comparisons between each of the following proteomes: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium discoideum, Chlamydomonus reinhardti, Escherichia coli K12, Arabidopsis thaliana and Methanoscarcina acetivorans. Our analysis of negative proteome datasets using the NPD has thus far revealed 107 proteins in humans that may be involved in motile cilia function, 1628 potential pesticide target proteins in flies, 659 proteins shared by flies and humans that are not represented in the less neurologically complex worm proteome, and 180 nuclear encoded human disease associated proteins that are absent from the fly proteome. The NPD is the only online resource where users can quickly perform complex negative and positive comparisons of model organism proteomes. We anticipate that the NPD and the adaptable algorithm which can readily be used to duplicate this analysis on custom sets of proteomes will be an invaluable tool in the investigation of organism specific protein sets.","464":"Upon completion of sequencing the Drosophila genome, it was estimated that 61% of human disease-associated genes had sequence homologs in flies, and in some diseases such as cancer, the number was as high as 68%. We now know that as many as 75% of the genes associated with genetic disease have counterparts in Drosophila. Using better tools for mutation detection, association studies and whole genome analysis the number of human genes associated with genetic disease is steadily increasing. These detection efforts are outpacing the ability to assign function and understand the underlying cause of the disease at the molecular level. Drosophila models can therefore advance human disease research in a number of ways by: establishing the normal role of these gene products during development, elucidating the mechanism underlying disease pathology, and even identifying candidate therapeutic agents for the treatment of human disease. At the 49(th) Annual Drosophila Research Conference in San Diego this year, a number of labs presented their exciting findings on Drosophila models of human disease in both platform presentations and poster sessions. Here we can only briefly review some of these developments, and we apologize that we do not have the time or space to review all of the findings presented which use Drosophila to understand human disease etiology.","465":"Protein ubiquitination has been shown to regulate a wide variety of cellular process including cell cycle progression, protein trafficking and apoptosis. Most regulation of ubiquitination occurs at the level of E2 or E3 enzymes and their interactions with specific substrates. In a screen for mutations that cause tissue overgrowth, we recovered multiple mutations in the Drosophila Uba1 gene that encodes the E1 enzyme that is required for the first step of most, if not all, ubiquitination reactions. Previous studies with yeast and mammalian cells have shown that disrupting E1 function results in a cell-cycle arrest. Here we show that in the developing Drosophila eye, clones of cells that are homozygous for partial loss of function alleles of Uba1 show defects in apoptosis. Moreover, clones homozygous for stronger or complete loss of function alleles of Uba1, that are predicted to have a global defect on ubiquitination, survive poorly but are able to stimulate the overgrowth of adjacent wild-type tissue. Experiments with mammalian cells show that reducing the level of RNA of the mammalian Uba1 ortholog, UBE1, also results in increased expression of specific growth factor genes. Our studies show that a reduction in E1 activity can promote tissue growth in a multicellular organism and raise the possibility that changes in E1 activity may occur during normal development or in cancer.","466":"We investigated population divergence in body melanisation in wild samples of Drosophila melanogaster across an elevational gradient (512-2202 m) in the Western Himalayas. Wild populations are characterized by higher phenotypic variability as compared with laboratory populations. Significant differences in elevational slope values for three posterior abdominal segments (fifth, sixth and seventh) in wild versus laboratory populations suggest plastic effects. However, elevational slope values do not differ for the three anterior abdominal segments (second, third and fourth). Thus, elevational changes in melanisation include genetic as well as plastic effects. Fitness consequences of within population variability were analyzed on the basis of assorted darker and lighter flies from two highlands as well as from two lowland localities. There is lack of correlation of melanisation with body size as well as ovariole number in assorted darker and lighter flies. For each population, darker flies showed higher desiccation resistance, lower rate of water loss, longer copulation duration and greater fecundity as compared with lighter flies. Phenotypic variations in body melanisation can be interpreted in relation with seasonal changes in temperature as well as humidity (Tcv and RHcv) of the sites of origin of populations. Thus, elevational changes in body melanisation may represent genetic response to selection pressures imposed by colder and drier climatic conditions in the Western Himalayas.","467":"In Drosophila, the role of telomerase is carried out by three specialized retrotransposable elements, HeT-A, TART and TAHRE. Telomeres contain long tandem head-to-tail arrays of these elements. Within each array, the three elements occur in random, but polarized, order. Some are truncated at the 5' end, giving the telomere an enriched content of the large 3' untranslated regions, which distinguish these telomeric elements from other retrotransposons. Thus, Drosophila telomeres resemble other telomeres because they are long arrays of repeated sequences, albeit more irregular arrays than those produced by telomerase. The telomeric retrotransposons are reverse-transcribed directly onto the end of the chromosome, extending the end by successive transpositions. Their transposition uses exactly the same method by which telomerase extends chromosome ends--copying an RNA template. In addition to these similarities in structure and maintenance, Drosophila telomeres have strong functional similarities to other telomeres and, as variants, provide an important model for understanding general principles of telomere function and evolution.","468":"Using an FLP\/FRT-based method to create germline clones, we screened Drosophila chromosome arms 2L and 3R for new female meiotic mutants. The screen was designed to recover mutants with severe effects on meiotic exchange and\/or segregation. This screen yielded 11 new mutants, including six alleles of previously known meiotic genes (c(2)M and ald\/mps1). The remaining five mutants appear to define at least four new genes whose ablation results in severe meiotic defects. Three of the novel meiotic mutants were identified at the molecular level. Two of these, mcm5(A7) and trem(F9), define roles in meiotic recombination, while a third, cona(A12), is important for synaptonemal complex assembly. Surprisingly, five of the nine mutants for which the lesion has been identified at the molecular level are not the result of mutations characteristic of EMS mutagenesis, but rather due to the insertion of the transposable element Doc. This study demonstrates the utility of germline clone-based screens for the discovery of strong meiotic mutants, including mutations in essential genes, and the use of molecular genetic techniques to map the loci.","469":"On August 1, 2006 the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's first stand-alone research campus opened at Janelia Farm, near Washington DC. Our mission at Janelia is to do exceptional fundamental research. Our two scientific foci are to understand the function of neural circuits and to develop synergistic imaging technologies. To achieve this we have changed many of the conventions of academic and\/or industrial science. The founding director at Janelia is the well-known Drosophilist Gerry Rubin, who has been a central figure in fly molecular, developmental and genomic biology in recent decades. Not coincidentally, we at Janelia fully appreciate the potential of flies to contribute to an understanding of neuronal circuits. Our objectives are ambitious, and in the first ten months of operations at Janelia we have made some good beginnings.","470":"A functional organ is constituted of diverse cell types. Each one occupies a distinct position and is associated to specific morphological and physiological functions. The identification of the genetic programs controlling these elaborated and highly precise features of organogenesis is crucial to understand how a mature organ works under normal conditions, and how pathologies can develop. Recently, a number of studies have reported a critical role for Hox genes in one example of organogenesis: cardiogenesis in Drosophila. Beyond the interest in understanding the molecular basis of functional cardiogenesis, this system might provide a model for proposing new paradigms of how Hox genes achieve their action throughout development.","471":"Signaling at the plasma membrane is modulated by up- and downregulation of signaling proteins. A prominent example for this type of regulation is the Drosophila TRPL ion channel that changes its spatial distribution within the photoreceptor cell. In dark-raised flies TRPL is localized in the rhabdomeral photoreceptor membrane and it translocates to the cell body upon illumination. It has been shown that TRPL translocation depends on the activation of the phototransduction cascade and requires the presence of functional rhodopsin as well as Ca2+-influx through a second lightactivated ion channel, TRP. However, little is known about the cell biological mechanism underlying TRPL translocation. Here we describe a FRT\/FLP screen designed to isolate mutants defective in TRPL internalization based on the localization of eGFP-tagged TRPL in the eyes of living flies. We mutated chromosome arms 2L, 2R and 3R and isolated 12 mutants that failed to internalize TRPL. We found that four mutants did not complement genes known to affect TRPL translocation, which are trp, ninaE and inaD. Two of the isolated mutants represent new alleles of trp and ninaE. The trp allele contains a premature stop codon after amino acid 884, whereas the ninaE allele has a mutation resulting in the substitution P193S. As determined biochemically no TRP or rhodopsin protein, respectively, was expressed in the eyes of these mutants. The absence of TRP or rhodopsin in the isolated mutants readily explains the defect in TRPL internalization and proves the feasibility of our genetic screen.","472":"","473":"Chromosomes are not inert structures that haul the genome through cell division. The dynamic properties of chromosomes, during the cell cycle, the lifetime of the organism and across evolutionary time, featured prominently at the 49(th) Annual Drosophila Research Conference. Platform presentations, workshops and posters focused on many aspects of chromosome structure and function including chromosome interactions such as trans-silencing and pairing between homologous and non-homologous chromosomes, specialized portions of the chromosome including the centromere and telomeres, the structure, function and evolution of the large heterochromatic domains such as the Y and 4(th) chromosomes, centric heterochromatin and subtelomeric heterochromatin. The speed of evolutionary changes in these regions, and the consequences for speciation and hybrid-incompatibility, were recurring themes. Finally, there was considerable new insight offered into the mechanics by which chromosomes are rearranged and changes in the types of alterations occurring over the lifetime of the organism, which can result in novel genes and gene flow between chromosomes. The availability of the twelve sequenced Drosophila genomes has allowed new insights into the structure, function and evolutionary transformation of chromosomes and genomes that will continue to transform our view of the chromosome as a dynamic and flexible entity that houses and regulates the genome.","474":"The yeast transcription factor GAL4 is widely used in Drosophila genetics to misexpress genes that are under control of the yeast upstream activator sequence (UAS). Here we show that high levels of GAL4 change the expression of many Drosophila genes in a UAS-independent manner, including genes that encode components of important signaling pathways. We find that at least part of the genomic response to GAL4 appears to be caused by effects of GAL4 on stress and immune response pathways. Finally, using the transcription factor Senseless as an example, we demonstrate how an interaction between GAL4 and a GAL4-driven protein can impede the use of the GAL4\/UAS system in experiments aimed at determining the transcriptional response to a misexpressed gene.","475":"Preparation of protein nuclear extracts is often the first step to study in vitro biological processes occurring in the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell. Nuclear extracts have been extensively used in different model organisms to identify and study protein function in nuclei. Drosophila embryos can be collected in large quantities and have been the source of choice for the production of protein nuclear extracts. However, most of Drosophila in vivo studies on protein function are conducted in larval tissues. Here we report a new method to produce highly stable large-scale protein nuclear extracts from whole Drosophila larvae that are suited for a variety of biochemical analyses.","476":"KASH (Klarsicht\/Anc-1\/Syne homology) domain proteins are cytoskeleton-associated proteins localized uniquely to the outer nuclear membrane. Klarsicht is a KASH protein required for nuclear migration in differentiating cells of the Drosophila eye. The C-terminal KASH domain of Klarsicht resides in the perinuclear space, and the cytoplasmic moiety connects to the microtubule organizing center. In C. elegans and vertebrate cells, SUN (Sad1\/UNC-84) domain proteins reside in the inner nuclear membrane and tether KASH proteins to the outer nuclear membrane. Is there a Drosophila SUN protein that performs a similar function, and if so, is it like Klarsicht, obviously essential for nuclear positioning only in the eye? Here, we identify Drosophila Klaroid, a SUN protein that tethers Klarsicht. klaroid loss-of-function mutants are indistinguishable phenotypically from klarsicht mutants. Remarkably, neither gene is essential for Drosophila viability or fertility, and even in klaroid klorsicht double mutants, the only obvious external morphological defect is rough eyes. In addition, we find that klaroid and klarsicht are required for nuclear migration in differentiating neurons and in non-neural cells. Finally, while perinuclear Klaroid is ubiquitous in the eye, Klarsicht expression is limited to differentiating cells and may be part of the trigger for apical nuclear migration.","477":"The diverse functional roles for RNA molecules in cells of the developing embryo have been an area of intense study in the last few years. Progress reported at the 49(th) Annual Drosophila Research Conference in San Diego, California highlighted many of the varied mechanistic activities for RNAs. In particular, talks at the 'RNA Biology' platform session provided a great deal of insight into the function of RNA transcripts and their associated protein complexes. The topics covered included: (1) a large-scale screen examining the localization of mRNAs during embryonic development, (2) mechanisms of mRNA transport in different cell types, (3) localization-dependent repression of mRNA translation and (4) the activity of the RNAi machinery in insulator-mediated chromatin structures. Our journey through the modern RNA world clearly indicates that we should be considering a much more expansive role for RNAs in molecular biology.","478":"The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways regulate diverse biological processes, including the immune and inflammatory response, cell growth, apoptosis, and tumour formation. Not surprisingly therefore defects to either pathway contributes to the progression of numerous human disorders. Enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms that control signaling through these pathways is therefore significant as it may enable development of specific treatments. In this regard, CYLD was recently identified as a negative regulator of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling. CYLD has a C-terminal catalytic domain characteristic of deubiquitinating enzymes, and this is essential for CYLD to remove ubiquitin from certain proteins that positively mediate signaling through the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Recent studies have revealed a requirement for CYLD in many different processes and have provided some insight into the underlying mechanisms.","479":"","480":"","481":"Growth factors of the TGF-beta family signal through type I\/II receptor complexes that phosphorylate SMAD transcription factors. In this study, we analyzed signaling of all seven TGF-beta members to identify those that mediate growth through the Drosophila type I receptor BABO. We find that two potential ligands of BABO, Myoglianin (MYO) and Maverick (MAV), do not activate dSMAD2. Only Drosophila Activin (dACT) and the Activin-like ligand Dawdle (DAW) signal through BABO in combination with the type II receptor PUNT and activate dSMAD2. Surprisingly, we find that activation of BABO can also lead to the phosphorylation of the \"BMP-specific\" MAD. In wing discs, expression of an activated form of dSMAD2 promotes growth similar to dACT and activated BABO. By itself, activated dSMAD2 does not affect DPP\/GBB target genes. However, coexpression of activated forms of dSMAD2 and MAD additively induces the expression of spalt. In contrast to dACT, we find that DAW does not promote growth when expressed in wings. In fact, coexpression of DAW with MAD or dSMAD2 decreases growth. daw mutants die primarily during larval stages and exhibit anal pad phenotypes reminiscent of babo mutants. The rescue of daw mutants by restricted expression in neuroendocrine cells indicates that Activin-type ligands are likely distributed through the endocrine system. The distinct signaling of dACT, DAW and MYO through BABO suggests the existence of co-receptors that modulate the canonical SMAD pathway.","482":"Regeneration of adult tissues relies on a small population of adult stem cells located in a specialized microenvironment. The adult stem cells divide continuously to produce new stem cells, as well as differentiated daughter cells to replenish lost cells due to damage or aging. The molecular mechanisms controlling their ability to divide, self-renew and differentiate remain largely undiscovered. The Drosophila reproductive systems have proven to be excellent models to understand the basic mechanisms regulating stem cell function. This report summarizes some of the recent advances in this field that were presented at the 49(th) Drosophila Research Conference held in San Diego in April 2008.","483":"Drosophila researchers met in sunny San Diego for the 49(th) Annual Meeting of The Genetics Society of America. It was cold outside and even colder inside. Like last year, 'Mitosis, Meiosis and Cell Division' was no longer a session. Instead, we searched out and covered talks and posters in 'Cell Division and Growth Control', 'Gametogenesis', 'Cytoskeleton and Cell Biology' and 'Genome and Chromosome Structure'. We split up for maximal coverage and re-grouped later for the Workshop on Cell Cycle and Checkpoints. We apologize in advance for the brevity or omission of some reports.","484":"Insects rely on visual cues to estimate and control their distance to approaching objects and their flight speed. Here we show that in free-flight, the motion cues generated by high-contrast vertical edges are crucial for these estimates. Within a visual environment dominated by high-contrast horizontal edges, flies fly unusually fast and barely avoid colliding with the walls of the enclosure. The disruption of flight behavior by horizontal edges provides insight into the structure of visually-mediated control algorithms.","485":null,"486":"We have developed a novel apparatus, an ergometer, to simultaneously measure the horizontal and vertical components of the work done during takeoff by the fruitfly, Drosophila. We confirm the anatomical prediction that all the work comes from the middle (mesothoracic) legs. With all six legs on the ergometer platform, displacement is directed roughly 45 degrees forwards or backwards. Both directions are equally likely. This provides for a random, rapid horizontal component to the escape behaviour for flies. When the thoracic stiffness is reduced (due to a mutation in which the indirect flight muscles (IFM) do not form myofibrils), jump output is increased. We conclude that the jump muscle, the tergal depressor of trochanter (TDT), which lacks direct muscle antagonists, performs work during the jump against thoracic stiffness. Both cuticle and IFM contribute to the thoracic stiffness as the TDT still produces repeated contractions in the absence of the IFM. Degeneration of the TDT due to mutants in three sarcomeric proteins results in reduction of the jump output. In one of these, the myosin heavy chain mutant, Mhc5, we show that degeneration occurs with age. The anatomical characteristics of Drosophila mean that we are recording, for the first time in the intact fly, the output of a single muscle that has high homology to vertebrate skeletal muscle. Developing an ergometer for Drosophila offers novel opportunities to assess the functional consequences of mutations in muscle proteins, synaptic physiology, neuromuscular development and aging.","487":"Thelytokous parthenogenesis (female progeny only) in animals is believed to arise initially in unfertilized eggs produced by bisexual females via the fusion of two haploid nuclei following meiosis, to produce diploid female progeny. The transition from sexual to parthenogenetic mechanisms of reproduction requires that the egg replace the paternal contributions of a haploid genetic complement and the basal body, which is thought to be essential for centrosome formation. The transitional facultative parthenogenetic stage is usually associated with a high rate of failed or abortive development, but the molecular and mechanistic reasons for this failure remain unclear. We show that a facultative parthenogenetic strain of Drosophila mercatorum produces a high percentage of unfertilized eggs competent to restore diploidy and form centrosomes de novo following meiosis. The female meiotic products replicate and divide by an acentrosomal mechanism in most oocytes and cytoplasmic centrosomes form in 35% of the oocytes. However, after pronuclear replication the cytoplasmic centrosomes must \"capture\" two haploid nuclei in order to restore diploidy. In practice, this process frequently fails due to centrosome-mediated capture events of single or more than two haploid nuclei, as well as multiple nuclear capture events in a single embryo when excess free centrosomes are not inactivated following formation of the first zygotic nucleus. Additionally, as development proceeds, many of the centrosomes that initiate syncytial development do not remain functional, possibly due to centrosome maturation defects, and later stages of syncytial development fail. The combined effect of the high error rate associated with nuclear capture and the failure of centrosome maturation during later developmental prevents successful parthenogenesis in most of the eggs that initiate development. This shows that the high rate of failed development associated with the transition from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction is limited by the low probability of the formation of a diploid zygotic nucleus with the correct complement of centrosomes in D. mercatorum.","488":"The Drosophila antenna is a sophisticated structure that functions in both olfaction and audition. Previous studies have identified Homothorax, Extradenticle, and Distal-less, three homeodomain transcription factors, as required for specification of antennal identity. Antennal expression of cut is activated by Homothorax and Extradenticle, and repressed by Distal-less. cut encodes the Drosophila homolog of human CAAT-displacement protein, a cell cycle-regulated homeodomain transcription factor. Cut is required for normal development of external mechanosensory structures and Malphigian tubules (kidney analogs). The role of cut in the Drosophila auditory organ, Johnston's organ, has not been characterized. We have employed the FLP\/FRT system to generate cut null clones in developing Johnston's organ. In cut mutants, the scolopidial subunits that constitute Johnston's organ differentiate abnormally and subsequently degenerate. Electrophysiological experiments confirm that adult Drosophila with cut null antennae are deaf. We find that cut acts in parallel to atonal, spalt-major, and spalt-related, which encode other transcription factors required for Johnston's organ differentiation. We speculate that Cut functions in conjunction with these factors to regulate transcription of as yet unidentified targets.","489":"In mammals, the hedonic aspects (good versus bad) and sensory aspects (i.e., the molecular quality) of taste are associated with different brain regions. Anatomical data argue against such a separation in the primary taste center of Drosophila larvae. Is only one aspect of taste represented or do both co-exist at the same location? I present evidence for a hedonic representation in the larval taste center and review anatomical and behavioral data which support the co-existence of a sensory representation of taste with a hedonic representation.","490":"The developing Drosophila eye-antennal disc is a particularly suited system for the genetic and cellular studies of complex biological processes. Methods to analyze Drosophila eye discs by flow cytometry are mainly based on the dissociation of tissues with trypsin. Dissociation operated by trypsin is very effective, though it causes a lot of stress to live cells often compromising the use of treated cells for further analyses. Here, we report a method to produce dissociated eye-disc cells that retain cell-membrane markers and that can be used for flow cytometry and cytological analysis of mitotic chromosomes. The method described is a great complementing tool for the cellular characterization of phenotypes resulting from classic clonal and miss-expression approaches in the Drosophila eye.","491":"Apical basal cell polarity is a fundamental feature of all epithelial cells. Identification of the genes involved in the polarization of epithelial cells has begun to reveal the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. An important issue is to understand the molecular basis for localization of cell polarity proteins in the context of the developing organism. Bazooka (Baz, Drosophila homolog of Par-3) plays a crucial role in organizing cell polarity in several different tissues. In the ovarian follicle epithelium, Par-1 protein kinase regulates Baz localization to the apical cell cortex by excluding phosphorylated Baz from the lateral region. In photoreceptor cells of retinal epithelium, Baz is targeted to the adherens junction (AJ) instead of the apical domain. Our study suggests that in photoreceptors, Par-1 blocks the localization of Baz to AJ whereas protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) promotes Baz localization by antagonizing the Par-1 effects. In this extra view, we provide a brief overview and perspective of our findings on the antagonistic function of Par-1 and PP2A in Baz localization during photoreceptor morphogenesis.","492":"RNA silencing functions as an adaptive antiviral defense in both plants and animals. In turn, viruses commonly encode suppressors of RNA silencing, which enable them to mount productive infection. These inhibitor proteins may be exploited as reagents with which to probe mechanisms and functions of RNA silencing pathways. In this report, we describe transgenic Drosophila strains that allow inducible expression of the viral RNA silencing inhibitors Flock House virus-B2, Nodamura virus-B2, vaccinia virus-E3L, influenza A virus-NS1 and tombusvirus P19. Some of these, especially the B2 proteins, are effective transgenic inhibitors of double strand RNA-induced gene silencing in flies. On the other hand, none of them is effective against the Drosophila microRNA pathway. Their functional selectivity makes these viral silencing proteins useful reagents with which to study biological functions of the Drosophila RNA interference pathway.","493":null,"494":"Green fluorescent protein-based reporters are commonly used to investigate protein nucleocytoplasmic transport. In this study we developed a novel reporter GFP2-GST which consists of two copies of GFP and one copy of GST, and tested it in two commonly used Drosophila cell lines. The size of the GFP2-GST reporter exceeds the passive diffusion limit across the nuclear pore complexes. It shows an exclusive cytoplasmic localization and displays a restrictive nuclear localization when a nuclear localization signal is appended. This reporter will largely facilitate the characterization and identification of NLS sequences in the fly proteome.","495":"As a growing number of haplotypic sequences from resequencing studies are now accumulating for Drosophila in the main primary sequence databases, collectively they can now be used to describe the general pattern of nucleotide variation across species and genes of this genus. The Drosophila Polymorphism Database (DPDB) is a secondary database that provides a collection of all well-annotated polymorphic sequences in Drosophila together with their associated diversity measures and options for reanalysis of the data that greatly facilitate both multi-locus and multi-species diversity studies in one of the most important groups of model organisms. Here we describe the state-of-the-art of the DPDB database and provide a step-by-step guide to all its searching and analytic capabilities. Finally, we illustrate its usefulness through selected examples. DPDB is freely available at http:\/\/dpdb.uab.cat.","496":"Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism for various types of aging studies. They are easy to maintain, relatively inexpensive, have short life cycles, provide large sample sizes, and can be genetically manipulated via various methods for testing. The 49(th) Annual Drosophila Research Conference, held in San Diego, CA (April 2-6, 2008), had over 30 poster presentations and eight platform talks devoted to physiology and aging, and seven presentations in a longevity and functional senescence workshop. The data presented via these avenues included life span manipulation, physiological related genes, candidate aging genes, gene expression, signaling, and using D. melanogaster as a model for age related disease, to name a few. This report provides highlights of some of the information presented in the poster, platform and workshop presentations.","497":"At the 49(th) Annual Drosophila Research Conference from April 3-8, 2008 in San Diego there were eight talks and over ninety posters in the section on Organogenesis and Gametogenesis. These covered a wide range of topics within the two broad categories of organ-specific stem cells (including germ cells) and organ-specific developmental programs. Here we discuss eleven of these presentations describing current research into the formation of the gonad, intestine, trachea, muscle and leg joint. The new insights presented advance our understanding of the molecular events that underlie interactions between stem cells and their niches as well as mechanisms underlying tissue-specific differentiation programs.","498":"The ocelli are three simple photoreceptors on the vertex of the fruit fly head. We sought to identify the gene encoded by the classical ocellar mutant, reduced ocelli (rdo). Deficiency and inversion breakpoint mapping and P-element induced male recombination analyses were performed and Pray For Elves (PFE; CG15151; Fbgn0032661) emerged as a promising candidate for the rdo phenotype. The PFE locus maps to polytene region 36E on chromosome 2L between elfless (Fbgn0032660) and Arrestin 1 (Fbgn0000120). FlyBase annotation predicts that PFE encodes a serine\/threonine kinase, yet protein prediction programs revealed no kinase domain. These analyses suggest that PFE simply encodes a leucine rich repeat molecule of unknown function, but presumably functions in nervous system protein-protein interaction. Two classical spontaneous alleles of rdo, rdo(1) and rdo(2), were characterized and the underlying mutations result from a small deletion spanning exon 1\/intron 1 and a B104\/roo insertion into the 3'UTR of PFE, respectively. Transposase-mediated excisions of several P-elements inserted into the PFE locus revert the rdo phenotype and a full-length PFE cDNA is sufficient to rescue rdo. A Gal4 enhancer trap reveals a broad adult neural expression pattern for PFE. Our identification and initial characterization of the rdo locus will contribute to the understanding of neurogenesis and neural development in the simple photoreceptors of the Drosophila visual system.","499":"Transgenes, especially those driving production of the GAL4 transcription factor in a specific spatial pattern, are a critical and widely used tool in the Drosophila research community. We recently noticed loss of GAL4-driven reporter gene expression in a series of crosses, and traced that loss of reporter gene expression to stochastic physical loss of the GAL4 gene in the driver line. We have demonstrated that the instability of the GAL4 transgene can be \"cured\" by treatment of the line with tetracycline, suggesting that the causative agent is of bacterial origin. A PCR assay revealed that the line is not infected by Wolbachia, an intracellular parasite known to infect a large percentage of stocks in the public stock centers and to affect mutant phenotypes. Our data indicate that other tetracycline-sensitive agents can cause genetic instability of transgenes, and also provides a potential solution to the problem.","500":"The sensation of touch, gravity, and sound all rely on dedicated ion channels that transduce mechanical stimulus forces into electrical signals. The functional workings and molecular identities of these mechanotransducer channels are little understood. Recent work shows that the mechanotransducers for fly and vertebrate hearing share equivalent gating mechanisms, whereby this mechanism can be probed non-invasively in the mechanics of the Drosophila ear. Here, we describe how this mechanics can be used to evaluate the roles of identified proteins in the process of mechanosensation and, specifically, their contributions to mechanotransduction.","501":"Diapause is a dormant state that insects may undergo as a response to changing environmental conditions. In flies, like many insects inhabiting temperate zones, diapause occurs generally during the winter months when ambient temperatures are cool and food sources scarce. Whilst the environmental factors involved in determining diapause have been known for a long time, the genes and molecular events controling its initiation are poorly understood. Here I outline the factors that initiate diapause and highlight recent studies that implicate insulin signaling in its control.","502":"The Drosophila hugin gene encodes a prepropeptide that can potentially generate several neuropeptides.(1) The gene is expressed in 20 cells of the subesophageal ganglion (SOG) that are involved in modulating feeding behavior.(2) One of the hugin neuropeptides shares homology with mammalian neuromedin U8 (NmU8), which has been shown to regulate feeding behavior in rodents.(3,4) Recent clonal analysis indicated that each hugin expressing neuron projects to one of four main targets: the protocerebrum, the ventral nerve cord, the pharynx and the corpora cardiaca.(5) In addition all hugin neurons send short neurites to a novel region ventro-lateral to the foramen, which we suggested could be the tritocerebrum. In this short article, we discuss two specific issues brought up by these analyses. One concerns the polarity of hugin neurons. The other is an evolutionary perspective on the processing of hugin neuropeptides in light of new data from mass spectrometric and genomic analyses.","503":"Proteomic analyses are critically important for systems biology because important aspects related to the structure, function and control of biological systems are only amenable by direct protein measurements. It has become apparent that the current proteomics technologies are unlikely to allow routine, quantitative measurements of whole proteomes. We have therefore suggested and largely implemented a two-step strategy for quantitative proteome analysis. In a first step, the discovery phase, the proteome observable by mass spectrometry is extensively analyzed. The resulting proteome catalog can then be used to select peptides specific to only one protein, so-called proteotypic peptides (PTPs). It represents the basis to realize sensitive, robust and reproducible measurements based on targeted mass spectrometry of these PTPs in a subsequent scoring phase. In this Extra View we describe the need for such proteome catalogs and their multiple benefits for catalyzing the shift towards targeted quantitative proteomic analysis and beyond. We use the Insulin signaling cascade as a representative example to illustrate the limitations of currently used proteomics approaches for the specific analysis of individual pathway components, and describe how the recently published Drosophila proteome catalog already helped to overcome many of these limitations.","504":"","505":"Site-specific transcription factors (TFs) recognise their target genes in a sequence- or conformation-dependent manor. In contrast to the basal TFs that are the general facilitators of gene expression, their site-specific interaction partners are tissue- or condition-specific. Thus, site-specific TFs constitute the major prerequisite for the modular expression programmes that drive metazoan development. This article deals with the computational identification of TFs (how to find them in genomes) and with online resources such as the FlyTF database of Drosophila site-specific TFs (how to find them online).","506":"Similar outcomes are often observed in species exposed to similar selective regimes, but it is unclear how often the same mechanism of adaptive evolution is followed. Here we present an analysis of selection affecting sequence variation in the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene of Drosophila americana, a species endemic to a large climate range that has been colonized by D. melanogaster. Unlike D. melanogaster, there is no evidence of selection on allozymes of ADH across the sampled range. This indicates that if there has been a similar adaptive response to climate in D. americana, it is not within the coding region of Adh. Instead, analyses of a combined dataset containing 86 alleles of Adh reveal purifying selection on the Adh gene, especially within its intron sequences. Frequency spectra of derived unpreferred variants at synonymous sites indicate that these sites are affected by weak purifying selection, but the deviation from neutrality is less drastic than observed for derived variants in noncoding introns. This contrast further supports the notion that noncoding sites in Drosophila are often subject to stronger selection pressures than synonymous sites.","507":"Drosophila embryonic dorsal-ventral polarity is defined by a maternally encoded signal transduction pathway. Gastrulation Defective, Snake, and Easter comprise a serine protease cascade that operates in the perivitelline space to generate active ligand for the Toll receptor, which resides in the embryonic membrane. Toll is activated only on the ventral side of the embryo. Spatial regulation of this pathway is initiated by the ventrally restricted expression of the sulfotransferase Pipe in the follicular epithelium that surrounds the developing oocyte. Pipe is thought to modify a target molecule that is secreted and localized within the ventral region of the egg and future embryo, where it influences the activity of the pathway such that active Toll ligand is produced only ventrally. A potential substrate for Pipe is encoded by nudel, which is expressed throughout the follicle cell layer and encodes a large, multi-functional secreted protein that contains a serine protease domain as well as other structural features characteristic of extracellular matrix proteins. A previous mosaic analysis suggested that the protease domain of Nudel is not a target for Pipe activity as its expression is not required in pipe-expressing cells, but failed to rule out such a role for other functional domains of the protein. To investigate this possibility, we carried out a mosaic analysis of additional nudel alleles, including some that affect the entire protein. Our analysis demonstrated that proteolytically processed segments of Nudel are secreted into the perivitelline space and stably localized, as would be expected for the target of Pipe, However, we found no requirement for nudel to be expressed in ventral, pipe-expressing follicle cells, thereby eliminating Nudel as an essential substrate of Pipe sulfotransferase activity.","508":"Studies on the formation of connections in the developing nervous system are greatly aided by methods that permit the differential visualisation and manipulation of pre- and postsynaptic partner neurons. This has been facilitated by the advent of the LexA-based, GAL4\/UAS-independent, binary expression system. On the molecular side, the introduction of DNA sequences into expression vectors has been simplified by the Invitrogen Gateway cloning technology. We have developed cloning vectors that combine the Gateway cloning technology with the LexA-based genetic expression system. These vectors facilitate the creation of driver and reporter constructs for the generation of Drosophila transgenic lines for the new LexA-based binary transcriptional system. We further report a new LexA::GAD sensory neuron driver and a red fluorescent membrane targeted lexAop reporter designed to complement the existing GFP-based lexAop reporter. Using these transgenic lines we have been able to differentially label motor and sensory neuron projections in the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila larvae.","509":"Internal fertilization protects gametes from inhospitable environments and ensures sufficient proximity for gamete union. However, close contact between individuals during mating also increases the risk of pathogen transfer. We developed an approach to transfer the entomopathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens from males to females during courtship and mating in Drosophila melanogaster. We then examined the frequency of contamination and bacterial loads of females copulating with males for varying durations, showing that while courtship is sufficient for bacterial transmission, mating significantly increases the bacterial load received in a time-independent manner. S. marcescens transmission from contaminated males during mating was sufficient to establish rapid, systemic infection and death in mated females.","510":"The association between recombination rate and nucleotide diversity provides compelling evidence for the action of natural selection across much of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. This conclusion is further supported by the lack of association between recombination rate and nucleotide divergence between species. However, studies of other species, including other Drosophila, have not always yielded the same results. Our recent study measured these parameters within the D. pseudoobscura species group using next-generation sequencing and high-throughput genotyping technologies. We documented fine-scale variation in crossover rate within D. pseudoobscura, and we observed that crossover variation was strongly associated with nucleotide diversity only when measured at a fine-scale. We also observed associations between crossover rate and sequence differences between D. pseudoobscura and its close relatives. These latter associations could have been driven in part by mutagenic effects associated with double-strand break repair, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it results primarily from shared ancestral polymorphisms. Overall, this work strongly underscores the importance of scale in testing for associations of recombination rate with other parameters, and it brings us one small step closer to understanding the role of natural selection and other evolutionary forces in shaping divergence among genomes.","511":"Neural function requires effective communication between neurons and their targets at synapses. Thus, proper formation, growth and plasticity of synapses are critical to behavior. A retrograde (muscle to neuron) BMP signal is required to promote synaptic growth, homeostasis and stability at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs).(1-4) We recently demonstrated that this signal constitutes an instructive signal that sculpts synaptic growth in a graded manner and uncovered a presynaptic endocytic mechanism that modulates BMP signaling levels. In the absence of this regulation, excessive BMP signaling results in overgrown NMJs with a proliferation of ectopic boutons.(5).","512":"How cells integrate both patterning and signaling information to select between distinct cell fates is a fundamental problem in developmental biology. In this short review, I focus on recent findings of how the Hox and senseless patterning genes regulate epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling and cell fate within the Drosophila abdomen. In Li-Kroeger et al., we described how a Hox and Senseless transcription factor competition functions as a molecular switch on a cis-regulatory element in the rhomboid (rho) gene to control EGF signaling within the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Here, I discuss an additional implication of these findings: that rho contains at least two cis-regulatory elements to control EGF secretion from the PNS, each to induce a different cell fate.","513":"Spatial information embedded in the extracellular matrix establishes the dorsoventral polarity of the Drosophila embryo through the ventral activity of a serine protease cascade. Pipe is a Golgi-localized protein responsible for generating this spatial information during oogenesis through sulfation of unknown glycans. Although Pipe has sequence homology to glycosaminoglycan 2-O-sulfotransferases, its activity and authentic substrates have not been demonstrated and genetic evidence has argued against a role for glycosaminoglycans in dorsoventral polarity establishment. Here, direct examination of matrix glycosaminoglycans demonstrates that pipe-mutant matrix shows decreased tri-sulfated heparan sulfate compared to wild-type matrix, with correspondingly increased 2-O-sulfated heparan sulfate. Chondroitin sulfate was not detected in this matrix. These results suggest that Pipe promotes 6-O- and\/or N-sulfation of heparan sulfate but is not required for heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfation. We discuss the possible significance of these unexpected findings and how they might be reconciled with the genetic data.","514":"We investigated within as well as between population variability in desiccation resistance, cuticular lipid mass per fly and cuticular water loss in nine geographical populations of a tropical drosophilid, Zaprionus indianus. Interestingly, the amount of cuticular lipids and desiccation resistance in this non-melanic species are significantly higher as compared with melanic Drosophila melanogaster. On the basis of isofemale line analysis, within population trait variability in cuticular lipid mass per fly is positively correlated with desiccation resistance and negatively correlated with cuticular water loss but show lack of correlation with body size. We observed geographical variation in the amount of cuticular lipid mass per fly in Zaprionus indianus but no such divergence was found in D.melanogaster. In both the species, geographical variations in desiccation resistance are negatively correlated with cuticular water loss but the underlying mechanisms for changes in cuticular permeability are quite different. Thus, we may suggest that body melanisation and cuticular lipids may represent alternative strategies for coping with dehydration stress in melanic versus non-melanic drosophilids. For both the species, desiccation resistance and cuticular water loss are correlated with regular increase in aridity in the northern subtropical localities as compared with southern peninsular humid tropical localities. The role of climatic selection is evident from multiple regression analysis with seasonal changes in temperature and humidity (Tcv and RHcv) of the sites of origin of populations of Zaprionus indianus along latitude.","515":"Tandem affinity purification (TAP) has been widely used for the analysis of protein complexes. We investigated the parameters of the recently developed TAP method (GS-TAP) and its application in Drosophila. This new tag combination includes two Protein G modules and a streptavidin binding peptide (SBP), separated by one or two TEV protease cleavage sites. We made pMK33-based GS-TAP vectors to allow for generation of stable cell lines using hygromycin selection and inducible expression from a metallothionein promoter, as well as pUAST-based vectors that can be used for inducible expression in flies. Rescue experiments in flies demonstrated that the GS-TAP tag preserves the function of the tagged protein. We have done parallel purifications of proteins tagged with the new GS-TAP tag or with the conventional TAP tag (containing the Protein A and calmodulin binding peptide domains) at the amino terminus, using both cultured cells and embryos. A major difference between the two tags was in the levels of contaminating proteins, which were significantly lower in the GS-TAP purifications. The GS-TAP procedure also resulted in higher yield of the bait protein. Overall, GS-TAP is an improved method of protein complex purification because it provides a superior signal-to-noise ratio of the bait protein relative to contaminants in purified material.","516":"Mutations in the Drosophila gene drop-dead (drd) result in early adult lethality and neurodegeneration, but the molecular identity of the drd gene and its mechanism of action are not known. This paper describes the characterization of a new X-linked recessive adult-lethal mutation, originally called lot's wife (lwf(1)) but subsequently identified as an allele of drd (drd(lwf)); drd(lwf) mutants die within two weeks of eclosion. Through mapping and complementation, the drd gene has been identified as CG33968, which encodes a putative integral membrane protein of unknown function. The drd(lwf) allele is associated with a nonsense mutation that eliminates nearly 80% of the CG33968 gene product; mutations in the same gene were also found in two previously described drd alleles. Characterization of drd (lwf) flies revealed additional phenotypes of drd, most notably, defects in food processing by the digestive system and in oogenesis. Mutant flies store significantly more food in their crops and defecate less than wild-type flies, suggesting that normal transfer of ingested food from the crop into the midgut is dependent upon the DRD gene product. The defect in oogenesis results in the sterility of homozygous mutant females and is associated with a reduction in the number of vitellogenic egg chambers. The disruption in vitellogenesis is far more severe than that seen in starved flies and so is unlikely to be a secondary consequence of the digestive phenotype. This study demonstrates that mutation of the drd gene CG33968 results in a complex phenotype affecting multiple physiological systems within the fly.","517":"Palmitoylation is the post-translational addition of a palmitate moiety to a cysteine residue through a covalent thioester bond. The addition and removal of this modification is controlled by both palmitoyl acyl-transferases and thioesterases. Using bioinformatic analysis, we identified 22 DHHC family palmitoyl acyl-transferase homologs in the Drosophila genome. We used in situ hybridization,RT-PCR, and published FlyAtlas microarray data to characterize the expression patterns of all 22 fly homologs. Our results indicate that all are expressed genes, but several, including CG1407, CG4676, CG5620, CG6017\/dHIP14, CG6618, CG6627 and CG17257 appear to be enriched in neural tissues suggesting that they are important for neural function. Furthermore, we have found that several may be expressed in a sex-specific manner with adult male specific expression of CG4483 and CG17195. Using tagged versions of the DHHC genes, we demonstrate that fly DHHC proteins are primarily located in either the Golgi Apparatus or Endoplasmic Reticulum in S2 cells, except for CG1407, which was found on the plasma membrane. We also characterized the subcellular localization and expression of the three known thioesterases: Palmitoyl-protein Thioesterase 1 (Ppt1), Palmitoyl-protein Thioesterase 2 (Ppt2)and Acyl-protein Thioesterase 1 (APT1). Our results indicate that Ppt1 and Ppt2 are the major lysosomal thioesterases while APT1 is the likely cytoplasmic thioesterase. Finally, in vivo rescue experiments show that Ppt2 expression cannot rescue the neural inclusion phenotypes associated with loss of Ppt1, further supporting distinct functions and substrates for these two thioesterases. These results will serve as the basis for a more complete understanding of the protein palmitoylome's normal cellular functions in the fly and will lead to further insights into the molecular etiology of diseases associated with the mis-regulation of palmitoylation.","518":"Recently, the issue of off-target effects (OTEs) associated with long double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) used in RNAi screens, such as those performed at the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center and other laboratories, has become a focus of great interest and some concern. Although OTEs have been recognized as an important source of false positives in mammalian studies (where short siRNAs are used as triggers), they were generally thought to be inconsequential in Drosophila RNAi experiments because of the use of long dsRNAs. Two recent papers have disputed this contention and show that significant off-target effects can take place with the use of some long dsRNAs in Drosophila cells. Together, these studies provide evidence that OTEs mediated by short homology stretches of 19nt or greater within long dsRNAs can contribute to false positives in Drosophila RNAi screens. Here, we address how widespread the occurrence of OTE is in Drosophila screens, focusing on the DRSC dsRNA collections, and we discuss the implication for the interpretation of results reported in RNAi screens to-date. Lastly, we summarize steps taken by the DRSC to redress that situation and include a set of recommendations to observe in future RNAi screens.","519":"Mitochondria undergo dramatic rearrangement during Drosophila spermatogenesis. In wild type testes, the many small mitochondria present in pre-meiotic spermatocytes later aggregate, fuse, and interwrap in post-meiotic haploid spermatids to form the spherical Nebenkern, whose two giant mitochondrial compartments later unfurl and elongate beside the growing flagellar axoneme. Drp1 encodes a dynamin-related protein whose homologs in many organisms mediate mitochondrial fission and whose Drosophila homolog is known to govern mitochondrial morphology in neurons. The milton gene encodes an adaptor protein that links mitochondria with kinesin and that is required for mitochondrial transport in Drosophila neurons. To determine the roles of Drp1 and Milton in spermatogenesis, we used the FLP-FRT mitotic recombination system to generate spermatocytes homozygous for mutations in either gene in an otherwise heterozygous background. We found that absence of Drp1 leads to abnormal clustering of mitochondria in mature primary spermatocytes and aberrant unfurling of the mitochondrial derivatives in early Drp1 spermatids undergoing axonemal elongation. In milton spermatocytes, mitochondria are distributed normally; however, after meiosis, the Nebenkern is not strongly anchored to the nucleus, and the mitochondrial derivatives do not elongate properly. Our work defines specific functions for Drp1 and Milton in the anchoring, unfurling, and elongation of mitochondria during sperm formation.","520":"","521":"To identify genes that modulate Rho signalling during cytokinesis we tested the effect of overexpressing a set of 2190 genes on an eye phenotype caused by defective Rho activation. The resulting 112 modifier loci fell into three main classes: cell cycle genes, signalling effectors and metabolic enzymes. We developed a further series of genetic tests to refine the interactors into those most likely to modify Rho signalling during cytokinesis. In addition to a number of genes previously implicated in the Rho pathway during cytokinesis, we identified four novel primary candidates: cdc14, Pitslre, PDK1 and thread\/diap1. cdc14 orthologs have, however, been implicated in cytokinesis in other organisms, as have molecules related to Thread\/Diap1. The identification of several modifiers that are genetically redundant paralogs highlights the ability of overexpression screens to identify genes that are refractory to traditional loss-of-function approaches. Overexpression screens and sensitized phenotypes, therefore, may help identify the many factors that are expected to be involved in cytokinesis but have not been discovered by previous genetic screens.","522":"Since the birth of the first cloned sheep in 1996, advances in nuclear transplantation have led to both the creation of genetically tailored stem cells and the generation of a number of cloned organisms. The list of cloned animals reared to adulthood currently includes the frog, sheep, mouse, cow, goat, pig, rabbit, cat, zebrafish, mule, horse, rat and dog. The addition of Drosophila to this elite bestiary of cloned animals has prompted the question - why clone flies? Organisms generated by nuclear transplantation suffer from a high rate of associated defects, and many of these defects appear to be related to aberrant genomic imprinting. Imprinted gene expression also appears to be compromised in Drosophila clones. Proper imprinted gene regulation relies on a suite of highly conserved chromatin-modifying genes first identified in Drosophila. Thus, Drosophila can potentially be used to study epigenetic dysfunction in cloned animals and to screen for genetic and epigenetic conditions that promote the production of healthy clones.","523":"The process of speciation requires the development of isolating mechanisms that act as barriers to gene flow between incipient species. Such mechanisms can occur at three different levels: precopulatory or behavioral isolation, postcopulatory-prezygotic isolation occurring in the female reproductive tract, or postzygotic isolation resulting in hybrid sterility or inviability. Only by extensively studying all three types of barriers in young species pairs can we begin to understand the evolution of early reproductive incompatibilities, which may be important to the speciation process. Although precopulatory and postzygotic isolation have been well described it is only recently that the female reproductive tract has been intensely examined for possible mechanisms of reproductive isolation (reviewed in refs 1 and 2). The types of isolating mechanisms that develop at this level and their role in speciation, therefore, remain poorly understood.","524":"Drosophila melanogaster pupae are exposed to many biotic and abiotic dangers while immobilized during several days of metamorphosis. As a passive defense mechanism, appropriate pupation site selection represents an important mitigation of these threats. Pupation site selection is sensitive to genetic and environmental influences, but the specific mechanisms of the behavior are largely unknown. Using a set of 76 recombinant inbred strains we identify a single quantitative trait locus, at polytene position 56A01-C11, associated with pupation site variation. We furthermore present a detailed investigation into the wandering behaviors of two strains expressing different pupation position tendencies, and identify behavioral differences. Larvae from a strain that tends to pupate relatively far from the food also tend to travel significantly farther from the media during wandering. We did not observe consistent differences in either the number or duration of wandering forays made by near or far pupating strains. The ability of larvae to integrate several internal and external environmental cues while choosing a contextually appropriate pupation site, and specifically, the variation in this ability, presents a very interesting behavioral phenotype in this highly tractable genetic model organism.","525":"The Pelican and Stinger series of P-element transformation vectors are a popular choice for reporter gene expression in transgenic flies. We report here as a cautionary note that these vectors on their own can drive reporter gene expression in the larval and pupal salivary gland.","526":"Increased size of eukaryotic genomes necessitated the use of multiple origins of DNA replication, and presumably selected for their efficient spacing to ensure rapid DNA replication. The sequence of these origins remains undetermined in metazoan genomes, leaving important questions about the selective constraints acting on replication origins unanswered. We have chosen to study the evolution of proteins that recognize and define these origins every cell cycle, as a surrogate to the direct analysis of replication origins. Among these DNA replication proteins is the essential Cdc6 protein, which acts to license origins for replication. We find that two different species pairs of Drosophila show evidence of positive selection in Cdc6 in their highly conserved C-terminal AAA-ATPase domain. We also identified amino acid segments that are highly conserved in the N-terminal tail of Cdc6 proteins from various Drosophila species, but are not conserved even in closely related insect species. Instead, we find that the N-terminal tails of Cdc6 proteins vary extensively in size and sequence across different eukaryotic lineages. Our results suggest that choice of origin firing may be significantly altered in closely related species, as each set of replication proteins optimizes to its own genomic landscape.","527":"At the Drosophila bithorax complex many distinct classes of cis-regulatory modules work collectively during development to control gene expression. Abdominal-B (Abd-B) is one of three homeotic genes in the BX-C and is expressed in specific presumptive abdominal segments in the embryo. The transcription of Abd-B is tightly controlled by an array of cis-regulatory modules that direct its expression over extended genomic distances. These regulatory modules include promoters, insulators, silencers, enhancers, promoter targeting sequences and the recently identified promoter tethering element (PTE). To activate gene expression at the endogenous complex, enhancers located &gt;50 kb away must bypass intervening insulators to interact with the Abd-B promoter. The molecular mechanisms that allow enhancers to bypass insulators are not currently well understood. In this short article, we report on a novel mechanism for insulator bypass involving the PTE. In addition, we use bioinformatic analysis across twelve Drosophila genomes to identify putative cis-regulatory sequences that may be capable of facilitating specific promoter-enhancer interactions at the bithorax complex and propose a model for their molecular function during development.","528":"","529":"","530":"","531":"","532":"","533":"","534":"","535":"","536":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Interorgan communication through peripherally derived peptide hormones in
