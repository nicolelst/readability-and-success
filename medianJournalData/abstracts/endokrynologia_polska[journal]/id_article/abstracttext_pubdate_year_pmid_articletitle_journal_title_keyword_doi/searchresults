Proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibody (mAb) is a new target lipid-regulating drug related to cholesterol metabolism that has been developed in recent years. The reported rate of reduction varies widely, and comprehensive assessments of efficacy and safety are lacking. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the clinical effect of PCSK9 mAbs in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia to provide a theoretical reference for clinical practice. We analysed the clinical data of patients, including the percentage change in LDL-C and the incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), from selected articles. Weighted mean differences (WMDs), risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to compare the endpoints. The results showed that, compared with placebo, the PCSK9 mAb reduced the percentage change in LDL-C in FH patients (WMD = -45.52, 95% CI: -49.70 to -41.34, I2 = 99.6%). In addition, there was no significant difference between the experimental and placebo groups in the incidence of TEAEs (RR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.10, I2 = 19.1%) and SAEs (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.44, I2 = 0.0%). Overall, PSCK9 mAbs are an effective and safe method of LDL-C reduction in patients with FH.

Although transsphenoidal resection of the defined pituitary adenoma has been the treatment of choice for the past decades, it does not always result in long-term remission - 10-30% of cases show ineffective surgical treatment or tumour recurrence even after initial success. Pharmacological therapies for cortisol reduction are often required for those who either cannot undergo pituitary surgery or when the surgery has failed, and patients still present with the persistent disease. Osilodrostat is a potent oral steroidogenesis inhibitor that has lately been shown as an effective adjuvant therapy in the management of patients with CD. In this article, we review the recent reports on the efficacy and safety of osilodrostat in clinical settings.","10":"Imeglimin (IMEG) is the first drug of the \"glimin\" group. Glimin is a new group of hypoglycaemic drugs for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The chemical structure and action mechanism of the drug are presented in the paper. Imeglimin is unique and different in action compared to other hypoglycaemic drugs. Imeglimin has been shown to have a beneficial effect on 3 key pathogenetic elements of T2DM, i.e., 1. increased gluconeogenesis, 2. inadequate glucose-induced insulin secretion by beta cells, and 3. peripheral insulin resistance. The peak effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of IMEG is reached after 16 weeks of treatment. Subjects receiving IMEG at 1000- and 1500-mg doses twice daily also achieved significantly greater reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels at week 24 compared to the placebo group (IMEG in humans causes increased insulin secretion as well as reductions in fasting plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin). This paper also presents the pharmacokinetics of IMEG action, clinical evidence for its efficacy, results of phase II and III clinical trials, and drug tolerability. Our paper seems to show that IMEG, with its novel mechanism of action, has a chance to improve treatment results in a larger population of T2DM patients.","11":"The conflict between breast cancer (BC) and thyroid hormone (TH) has been studied for years. The purpose of the study was to summarise and analyse the available data on the relationship between TH and BC. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify relevant studies. The mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by fixed or random effects models to assess the effect sizes. Thirteen eligible studies with 5957 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The result of this study indicates that there is a significant risk relationship between BC and thyroid hormones [free triiodothyronine (FT3): MD = 1.01 pmol\/L, 95% CI: 0.32-1.70, free thyroxine (FT4): MD = 0.26 ng\/dL, 95% CI: 0.13-0.38]. Compared with healthy controls, the positive risk of FT3 and FT4 is higher in BC. ","12":"Pheochromocytoma is a hormonally active tumour originating from neuroendocrine cells of the adrenal medulla. Chromogranin A (CgA) and peptide proSAAS belong to the family of granins and are present in neuroendocrine cells of adrenal medulla, from where they are released to circulation, along with catecholamines. The aim of this study was to assess the usability of proSAAS peptide assay in patients with adrenal pheochromocytoma. 23 patients (13 females and 10 males) with adrenal pheochromocytoma (benign in 18 patients and malignant in 5) confirmed by histopathology examination, and 35 blood donors as a control group. Plasma free metanephrines, CgA, and proSAAS peptide levels were measured in all participants. CgA and proSAAS levels in the group of pheochromocytoma patients vs. the control were: 209 ng\/mL and 0.8 ng\/mL vs. 59 ng\/mL and 0.3 ng\/mL (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. The following sensitivity and specificity indexes were obtained from ROC curves for CgA: 83% and 92%, respectively, and for the proSAAS peptide: 39% and 88%, respectively. The combination of 2 parameters: normetanephrine and proSAAS (96% and 100%) had a high diagnostic value, and the value of all determined parameters together (metanephrine, normetanephrine, CgA, and proSAAS) was 100%. A single determination of the proSAAS peptide level is associated with a rather low diagnostic value. But collective determination of CgA and proSAAS may be an additional, valuable tool in biochemical diagnostics of pheochromocytoma. ","13":"The reference values for thyroid volume (TV) suggested by the WHO are recommended for children aged 6 to 12 years and cannot be considered relevant for infants. The present study aimed to establish the normal values for TV and thyroid isthmus depth (TID) in infants aged between 1 and 12 months from the west coast of Turkey. The TV and TID were measured in 223 infants by a validated ultrasound technique. The TV was determined by the method of Brunn et al. and Brown et al. The 3rd, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 97th percentiles of the TV and TID according to age were produced. The TV and TID measurements were compared with infants' age, gender, and standard deviation (Z) scores for weight, height, and BMI. The median (IQR) values for TV were 0.77 (0.61-1.00) and 0.84 (0.67-1.10) mL, calculated according to the formula of Brunn et al. and Brown et al., respectively. The TV was significantly associated with age, and Z scores for weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.366, p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.343, p &lt; 0.0001; r = 0.269, p &lt; 0.0001; and r = 0.157, p = 0.019; respectively). The median (IQR) value for the TID was 1.5 (1.3-1.9) mm. The TID was significantly correlated with TV and the Z score for height (r = 0.190, p = 0.004; and r = 0.144, p = 0.032; respectively). In multivariable regression, the only independent predictor for TV was the Z score for BMI. No differences based on gender were found. This is the first study to report the normative values for TV and TID in healthy Turkish infants aged up to 12 months. Our findings may serve as a basis for developing national and international references for TV and TID in infants.

The aim of the present study was to detect whether any association exists between SAT and oxidative stress, and to determine the factors of a possible association. Twenty-five patients who were newly diagnosed with SAT and 30 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), paraoxonase 1 (PON1), and dynamic thiol\/disulphide [native thiol (NT), total thiol (TT), disulphide (DS), DS\/TT, DS\/NT, and NT\/TT] levels of the participants were evaluated. Total thiol and NT levels were found to be lower in the SAT group (p &lt; 0.001). DS\/NT and DS\/TT levels were significantly higher in the patients with SAT, whereas NT\/TT levels were lower (p &lt; 0.05). A negative correlation was detected between C-reactive protein (CRP) and TAS, whereas a positive correlation was detected between CRP and OSI. There was a negative association between TSH and TAS only in the partial correlation analysis by adjusting for age, white blood cell count, neutrophil (Neu) level, CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (r = -0.481, p = 0.043). Thiol levels are significantly decreased and thiol\/disulphide homoeostasis is disrupted in patients with SAT. The present study has presented for the first time that there may be an association between SAT and oxidative stress.

Often the differentiation between adenoma and carcinoma is challenging and requires multidisciplinary cooperation. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. We present a retrospective analysis of 29 patients who were surgically treated for parathyroid cancer. Between the years 1983 and 2018, 71 (7.0%) patients were treated for suspicion of parathyroid cancer among a group of 1019 operated for primary hyperparathyroidism. We confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid cancer in 29 (2.8%) patients, 12 men and 17 women, aged 27 to 77 years, mean 55.1 years. That constituted 43.9% of the 71 patients with initial suspicion of cancer diagnosis. All operated patients were under long-term observation. A diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma should always be considered during surgery in patients diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism, especially in patients with severe hypercalcaemia, significantly enlarged neck circumference, and concomitant diseases of the renal and skeletal system. Parathyroid carcinoma is rarely definitively diagnosed preoperatively or even intraoperatively, and the final diagnosis can be made exclusively after operation. The optimal treatment is a complete surgical resection at a reference centre - specialized in parathyroid surgery - to improve outcomes and provide the best chance of recovery.

The prevalence of MetS is increasing all over the world. Central obesity is the main and the most common component of MetS. The most simple, practical, and frequently used tool for assessing body weight is body mass index. The aim of our study was to show the correlation between waist circumference (WC) and BMI in women with MetS depending on its components. It was a study of 36-month duration (2016-2019) conducted in University Hospital No. 1 in Bydgoszcz, Poland. The study included 696 women with diagnosed MetS according to the 2009 International Diabetes Federation criteria. In the study group, WC was found to be significantly correlated with BMI according to the arterial hypertension, T2DM, IFG, lower HDL-C, and higher TG level. We should consider changing the WC guidelines for Europeans, but for this we need more prospective studies. ","22":"This review aimed to synthesize evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the glycaemic control, physical activity, and diet of diabetic patients. Two electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) were searched from January 2020 to February 2021. A total of 161 unique records were retrieved. Out of these, 25 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. The quality of the studies was assessed by using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for observational studies. Out of the 25 studies included in the review, 18 (72%) were cross sectional, 5 (20%) were retrospective analyses, and 2 (8%) were cohort studies. Thirteen studies included type I diabetics, 8 studies included type2 diabetics, and 4 studies included both. In the quality assessment, 17 (68%) of the studies met the criteria of satisfactory quality. Overall glycaemic parameters were improved during the lockdown. Dietary patterns were affected during the lockdown, but the direction of change- either negative or positive- could not be inferred. However, physical activity patterns were found to be deteriorated during the lockdown. The review found that lockdowns for curbing COVID-19 had no negative impact on glucose control, while there was a decline in the physical activity among diabetics. Furthermore, available studies are subject to various biases, which calls for robust studies in future with representative samples. There is also a need to promote physical activity and a healthy diet among diabetic patients, with follow-up through telemedicine during such confinement periods. ","23":"Thyrotoxic myopathy is hyperthyroidism accompanied by muscle lesions. It is recognized as the general term for a group of symptoms with several main manifestations of several hyperthyroidism patients in the course (e.g. muscle weakness, muscle paralysis, or pain). From the clinical perspective, it may only be manifested as muscle-related symptoms. The symptoms of high metabolic syndrome (e.g. thyrotoxicosis) are absent, obscured, or relatively delayed, so it can be easily misdiagnosed. Accordingly, patients experiencing the first symptom of myopathy should concentrate on the possibility of thyrotoxic myopathy. Given the clinical characteristics, thyrotoxic myopathy can be devided into chronic thyrotoxic myopathy, thyrotoxicosis with periodic paralysis, acute thyrotoxic myopathy, hyperthyroidism with myasthenia gravis, as well as infiltrating exophthalmos with ophthalmoplegia. In this paper, we review thyrotoxic myopathy research status, diagnoses, and treatments.","24":"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clinical syndrome with several characteristics. Steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which can increase the expression of steroid receptor-dependent gene. This study aimed to explore the changes in metabolic parameters and the predictive value of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to SRA ratios as new indicators in subjects with and without MetS in southern China. There were 81 participants (39 with MetS and 42 without MetS) in this cross-sectional study. The expression of lncRNAs in PBMCs was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The risks of SRA and PBMCs to SRA ratios contributing to the presence of MetS were estimated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. The area under the receiver (AUC) operating characteristic curve was employed to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. MetS was positively correlated with cortisol, interleukin 6 (IL-6), white blood cell to SRA ratio (WTSR), lymphocyte to SRA ratio (LTSR), monocyte to SRA ratio (MTSR), and PBMC to SRA ratio (PTSR). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the value of LTSR (OR: 0.722; p &lt; 0.001) for predicting MetS. The area under the curve yielded a cut-off value of 0.483, with a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 71.4% (p &lt; 0.001). In summary, SRA in PBMCs may be an important biomarker of stress reaction and may play a role in vulnerability to MetS. Also, the lymphocyte to SRA ratio demonstrated high accuracy in the diagnosis of MetS. ","25":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) pathogenesis is multifactorial and is a combination of metabolic, genetic, and environmental factors. Due to a long period of asymptomatic course, it is often diagnosed late when advanced stages of the disease are present. Among patients with diabetes, the presence of chemotactic cytokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene polymorphism is suspected to be associated with the risk of DKD occurrence; however, the results of the research conducted so far are inconclusive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CCR5 gene polymorphism (rs1799987, 59029 A\/G) association with DKD among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), who are residents of the Upper Silesia region of Poland. CCR5 gene polymorphism (rs1799987, 59029 A\/G) was assessed among consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated in a single outpatient diabetology clinic in Upper Silesia, Poland. Its association with DKD was examined. Additionally, selected clinical and demographic data were included in the analysis. Among 467 eligible study patients, there was no association between examined CCR5 gene polymorphism and the presence of DKD in relation both to the American Diabetes Association definition (p = 0.6) and to the National Kidney Foundation definition (p = 0.3) of this complication. The presented study did not confirm the association between the examined gene polymorphism and the risk of DKD; further studies in this area are needed in order to establish or explicitly exclude this association.

By analyzing the examination of a patient suffered with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, we sought to find a correct assessment method. Radioimmunoassay, chemiluminescence immunoassay on an ADVIA Centaur XP system and Architect i2000sr platform, and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on a Roche Cobas 601 system were used for detecting thyroid function. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation were performed to eliminate the influence of THAAbs. The results showed that the patient's thyroid function was consistent with the clinical manifestations and conformed to the law of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis at Architect-i2000sr platform and Roche-Cobas-601 system. The content of FT4 was significantly reduced and lower than the normal reference range, after the patients' serum was treated with PEG, which was in line with the clinical practice. The serum THAAb titer of the patients was nearly 100 times higher than that of the control group. Considering an abnormal thyroid function examination, it is necessary for laboratory staff to retest samples on different platforms. It is of great significance to provide a true and accurate result to clinicians and patients. ","34":"Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disorder whose management raises many challenges in clinical practice. Its standard treatment is levothyroxine (LT4). The goal of the treatment is to normalize signs and symptoms, as well as to achieve thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations within the reference range, on an individual basis. It is known that 5-10% of hypothyroid patients remain symptomatic, despite achieving the target TSH levels, which, in turn, affects their quality of life. After ruling out other causes of non-thyroid origin for this persistence, it is suggested that these patients could benefit from the use of liothyronine (LT3), added to LT4, especially if polymorphism of the deiodinase 2 (D2) genes is documented. There exist a variety of LT3 preparations, whose concentrations vary from 5 to 50 ug, with the recommended LT4\/LT3 ratio of 13:1-20:1. The goals of combination therapy should be to achieve a physiological ratio of free triiodothyronine\/free thyroxine (FT3\/FT4) and non-suppression of TSH. Because there is currently no guide that makes evidence-based recommendations on the use of LT3 in primary hypothyroidism, more clinical studies are needed to be able to identify hypothyroid patients who may benefit from the use of LT3, by identifying new biomarkers.","35":"Graves' disease (GD) is the most common cause of paediatric hyperthyroidism. In children and adolescents, the clinical GD course is different from that seen in adults, due to low remission rate and high prevalence of adverse events related to treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs). Most patients in this group require definitive therapy. As in adults, there are 2 treatment options- thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine (RAI) or surgery with preferred procedure of total thyroidectomy (TT). The choice of definitive therapy depends on many important factors such as the child's age, effectiveness of the first-line ATD treatment, presence of ATD side effects, presence of large goitre or thyroid nodules, and concomitant diseases. The following paper provides the current guidelines on GD management in children and compares the efficacy of both definitive treatment methods as well as the acute and long-term complication rates, which must be taken into account when choosing the optimal therapeutic option.","36":"Under normal physiological conditions, insulin exhibits a series of important biological functions and roles. Recent studies have shown that insulin is also closely related to the occurrence and development of lung cancer. However, until now, the cellular properties of insulin\/insulin receptor (IR) on lung cancer have not been fully revealed. Indirect immunofluorescence, western blot, and other techniques have been used to identify the biological activity of insulin on lung cancer cell lines. The biological activities of insulin are closely related to its cell behaviour. Therefore, we used lung cancer cell lines as a model to explore the cellular behaviour and properties of insulin\/IR in the current study, and the results showed that the IR could internalize into lung cancer cells, and it can also transport into the cell nuclei under insulin treatment. Further study showed that nuclear-localized IR could promote the proliferation of lung cancer cells. Taken together, this study shows that IR's nuclear localization is closely related to cell proliferation. This work lays the foundation for further research on the relationship between insulin and the occurrence and development of lung cancer.

Early identification and treatment of patients are necessary to prevent future cardiometabolic and reproductive complications. In our study, we aimed to investigate whether Drosha, Exportin-5 (XPO5), and Dicer, which are involved in miRNA formation, are useful markers in the diagnosis of the disease. Patients who presented to our clinic with complaints such as menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and acne were diagnosed with polycystic ovary after excluding other possible diagnoses, and if they meet two-thirds of the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria, they were included in the study. Thirty patients with polycystic ovaries and 35 healthy controls were included in this study. The mean values of XPO5, Drosha, and Dicer markers were significantly higher in the PCOS group when compared with the control group. With an XPO5 value &gt; 1.70, we found the PCOS with 94% probability, 86.7% sensitivity, and 91.4% specificity. Moreover, if the Drosha value was &gt; 0.166, it was expected that the patient would be diagnosed as PCOS with a probability of 75%, with 66.7% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. A statistically significant cut-off value could not be obtained for Dicer. In our study, the levels of all three markers were found to be significantly higher in the PCOS group compared to the control group. It suggests that they can be used in the early diagnosis of PCOS patients without full-blown disease. However, this preliminary study should be supported by larger-scale studies.

However, they may present with headaches, visual impairment, or pituitary dysfunction. Rathke cleft cysts are poorly described in the Polish literature. We aimed to characterize presenting symptoms, associated endocrine dysfunction, and concomitant disorders in the Polish population of patients with RCC. We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of 102 patients diagnosed with RCC between 2006 and 2021 at Heliodor Swiecicki Clinical Hospital in Poznan and Independent Public Clinical Hospital No. 4 in Lublin. The cohort was 72% female, with a mean age of 43 years. The median maximal cyst diameter was 7 mm. The majority of subjects were overweight or obese and presented lipid profile or glucose disturbances. Common presenting symptoms included headache, vertigo, and visual impairment. Less frequently we observed sexual dysfunction, irregular menses, galactorrhoea, or fatigue. Hormonal abnormalities were identified in 30% of patients, with hyperprolactinaemia being the commonest endocrinopathy (23%). Pituitary function in patients with RCC did not correlate with cyst size. Both concomitant pituitary adenomas and pineal cysts were diagnosed in 3% of patients. A considerable proportion of subjects were diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and multinodular goitre. RCCs occur mostly in females and may result in a variety of symptoms and hormonal dysfunction. Patients require a full clinical and endocrine evaluation regardless of the cyst diameter. We report a substantial co-occurrence of RCC and metabolic disorders and primary thyroid diseases, which requires further investigation.

Irisin is a hormone that plays a significant role in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Irisin was also reported to play significant roles in the central nervous system. In the literature there are reports indicating a beneficial antidepressant role of irisin in MDD.

This leads to an infiltration of CD4+ cells involved in stimulating the effector cells cytotoxicity and stimulating the humoral response. One of the most common autoimmune disorders are autoimmune thyroid diseases, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves's diseases. Helper T lymphocytes, which are divided into Th1, Th2, Tregs, and the relatively new groups Th17, Th22, and Th9, are involved in the pathogenesis of AITD. CD4+ cell subtypes mature and differentiate by specific transcription factors and in a specific interleukin environment. Not only are Th1 and Th2 cells involved in the development of AITD, but also Th17, Th22, and Th9 lymphocytes and their correlation to Tregs lymphocytes. The plasticity of the CD4+ cells is very important, affecting the balance between these cells, as well the factors modulating their phenotypic variability. Patients with AITD have an increased percentage of Th17, Th22, and Th9 cells as well as defective function of Tregs lymphocytes. The balance between Th17 cells (and also other cytotoxic T cells) and Treg cells is also very important. Understanding the role of CD4 cells in the pathogenesis of AITD may be important not only for the development of the knowledge, but also for determining therapeutic targets.","49":"The objective was to study targeted therapies using a biologically active monoclonal antibody against intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1 mAb) and an siRNA targeting thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR) in a BALB\/c mouse model of Graves' disease (GD). An improved method for establishing a stable model of GD in BALB\/c mice was developed by immunization with pcDNA 3.1\/TSHR 289 and electroporation (EP). The mice in which GD was successfully established were divided into a nontreated control group, which was treated with continuous immunization, and treated groups, which were treated with the siRNA and ICAM-1 mAb. Normal mice were included as a blank group. These groups were used to compare the effects of treatment with the ICAM-1 mAb and siRNA. The two novel treatments markedly improved weight loss, serum thyroxine (T4) levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone antibody (TSAb) levels, thyroid-stimulating blocking antibody (TSBAb) levels and thyroid uptake of 99mTcO4 in GD model mice. Compared with the siRNA treatment, treatment with the ICAM-1 mAb produced more obvious benefits. The differences in the posttreatment indexes between the two treatment groups were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). These preliminary data suggest that both the biologically active ICAM-1 mAb and the siRNA targeting TSHR were effective. The ICAM-1 mAb exerted a better therapeutic effect than the siRNA targeting TSHR. Both treatments showed potential efficacy as novel treatments for GD and may therefore represent therapeutic options in addition to the existing drugs or interventions.

AVP exerts several effects by binding to three different receptors: V1aR, V1bR, and V2R. In recent years, it has been suggested that increased plasma concentration of AVP may play a causal role in the development of type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, renal dysfunction and cardiovascular disease by influencing glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism through several possible mechanisms involving V1aR and V1bR. V1aR located in the liver is involved in hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. V1bR, found in the pituitary gland and pancreas, mediates secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), insulin, and glucagon. However, AVP's clinical use as a biomarker is limited due to its short half-life in plasma (16-20 minutes), small size, and poor stability, which make direct measurement difficult. Copeptin, the biologically inactive, stable, C-terminal part of pro-vasopressin, is co-secreted with AVP in equimolar amounts and thus is considered an adequate and clinically useful surrogate marker of AVP. The aim of this review is to assess the current state of knowledge about the potential role of copeptin as a novel biomarker of cardiometabolic syndrome on the basis of recent scientific literature published up to December 2020 and searches of the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases.","60":null,"61":"Administration of testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone to subjects with low levels of these hormones was found to reduce thyroid antibody titres. Male-pattern baldness is accompanied by mildly increased androgen levels. The present study was aimed at investigating whether early-onset androgenetic alopecia determines the impact of exogenous levothyroxine on thyroid autoimmunity and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity in young men with autoimmune hypothyroidism. The study included 2 thyroid-antibody-matched groups of men with autoimmune hypothyroidism: subjects with early-onset androgenetic alopecia (group 1; n = 24) and subjects with no evidence of hair loss (group 2; n = 24). All patients were treated with exogenous levothyroxine. Circulating titres of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, as well as levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, prolactin, total testosterone, calculated bioavailable testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate, and oestradiol were measured before levothyroxine treatment and 6 months later. In both study groups, levothyroxine decreased thyroid antibody titres, reduced thyrotropin levels and increased free thyroid hormone levels. However, these effects were less pronounced in the men with early-onset male-pattern baldness than in the control men. The degree of reduction in antibody titres and thyrotropin levels correlated with baseline levels of total and calculated bioavailable testosterone, as well with baseline insulin sensitivity and treatment-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity. Concentrations of the remaining variables remained unchanged throughout the study period. The results of the current study suggest that the benefits of levothyroxine therapy in men with autoimmune hypothyroidism are less pronounced in individuals with early-onset androgenetic alopecia.

Hormonal status is known to affect blood count parameters. The aim of this study is to summarize changes in blood count that may indicate endocrine disorders, based on a literature review. Red cell parameters deteriorate in thyroid disorders including autoimmune thyroiditis and tend to resolve with appropriate treatment implementation. The most frequent form of anaemia associated with thyroid dysfunction is normocytic anaemia. Macrocytic anaemia is more typical of autoimmune thyroiditis-induced hypothyroidism, while microcytic anaemia is more common in hyperthyroidism. Unexplained anaemia or an increase in red cell distribution width should prompt the investigation of thyroid disorders. Cushing's disease may manifest as an increase in white blood cells and platelets. In the blood smear, neutrophilia is often present, while lymphocytes and eosinophils may be within the lower normal range. Hypercortisolism may induce both hyperaemia and anaemia. In hypopituitarism, a decrease in red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelets is observed. Acromegaly may be accompanied by an increase in mean corpuscular volume of erythrocytes. Testosterone deficiency is manifested by a decrease in red cell parameters, whereas hyperandrogenism may lead to polycythaemia. In polycystic ovary syndrome an increase in white blood cell count reflects an underlying inflammatory state.

AN patients strive to lose weight below the normal limits defined for a specific age and height, achieving their goal even at the expense of extreme emaciation. AN has a multifactorial aetiology. Genetic factors are believed to be significant in the predisposition to the development of AN. In girls suffering from AN significantly lower levels of resistin (RES) in blood serum are observed as compared to healthy girls. These differences may lead to a thesis that functional genetic polymorphisms in RES coding genes can be responsible for this phenomenon. In our pilot study we demonstrated significant differences in the distribution of genotypes in the locus RETN c.-180C&gt;G of the RES gene in 67 girls with AN and 38 healthy girls. It seems reasonable to compare the frequency of polymorphisms of RETN c.62G&gt;A and RETN c.-180C&gt;G in the RES gene in girls with AN and in healthy subjects in a bigger cohort and to analyse correlations between individual variants of the polymorphisms referred to above and the RES levels in blood plasma. The study covered 308 girls with the restrictive form of AN (AN) and 164 healthy girls (C) (aged 11-19 years). The RES levels in blood serum were determined by means of the ELISA method on a Bio-Vendor machine from LLC (Asheville, North Carolina, USA). The DNA isolation was carried out by means of Genomic Mini AX BLOOD (SPIN). The PCR reaction was carried out on a ThermoCycle T100 thermocycler. 80-150 ng of the studied DNA and relevant F and R starters were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction products were subjected to digestion by restriction enzymes and separated on agarose gels (RFLP). The average RES level in blood serum in the AN group was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0001) than in the C group. The distribution of genotypes in the locus RETN c.62 of the RES gene was similar in both groups. A significant difference was demonstrated in the distribution of genotypes in the polymorphic site RETN c.-180 of the RES gene between AN and C (p = 0.0145) and in the distribution of the C and G alleles in the locus RETN c.-180 (p &lt; 0.0001).

A broad meta-analysis points to a strong genetic correlation between AN and insulin resistance. Adiponectin (ADIPO) increases insulin sensitivity.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the occurrence of ADIPOQ c.45 T&gt;G and ADIPOQ c.276 G&gt;T in the ADIPO gene in a larger cohort of girls with AN and healthy girls, as well as an analysis of correlations between variants of the aforementioned polymorphisms and the levels of ADIPO in blood serum. The study covered 472 girls (age: 11-19 years): 308 with the restrictive form of AN (AN) and 164 healthy girls (C). The level of ADIPO in blood serum was determined by means of the ELISA method on a Bio-Vendor, LLC (Asheville, North Carolina, USA). The DNA isolation was carried out by means of Genomic Mini AX BLOOD (SPIN). The PCR reaction was carried out in a ThermoCycle T100 thermocycler. 80-150 ng of the studied DNA and relevant F and R starters were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction products were subjected to digestion by restriction enzymes and separated on agarose gels (RFLP). The distribution of genotypes in the polymorphic site ADP c.45 of the ADIPO gene and ADP c.276 was similar in both groups. In both groups the T allele was most frequent in locus ADIPOQ c.45 and the G allele in locus ADIPOQ c.276. In all the study subjects collectively (AN and C) a statistically significant negative correlation between the levels of ADIPO in blood serum on one hand and body weight (r = -0.46; p &lt; 0.0001) and BMI (r = -0.67; p &lt; 0.0001) on the other was demonstrated. Exclusively in the AN group a significant correlation between the level of ADIPO in blood and the distribution of TG, TT, and GG alleles in loci ADIPOQ c.45 and ADIPOQ c.276 was demonstrated (p = 0.0052 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). The genotype in loci ADIPOQ c.45 and ADIPOQ c.276 of the ADIPO gene seems to have no effect on the predisposition to AN. Girls suffering from AN with the TT genotype in loci ADIPOQ c.45 and ADIPOQ c. 276 may demonstrate higher insulin sensitivity because they have significantly higher levels of ADIPO than girls suffering from AN with other genotypes. This may be suggestive of their better adaptation to the state of malnutrition, and it has a potential effect on treatment results. ","72":"There is an increasing number of adrenal tumours discovered incidentally during imaging examinations performed for many different indications. Based on imaging results, it is possible to differentiate benign from malignant adrenal masses, although there is still a number of equivocal imaging findings. Our study presents 77 cases of adrenal tumours in which imaging was inconclusive and the final diagnosis was stated only after surgery and histopathological examination. Retrospective data analysis: 77 cases of indeterminate adrenal tumours with a presumptive diagnosis of \"nonadenoma\" in patients operated within a 16-year period (2004-2019). None of the patients had a history of malignancy, and all tumours were hormonally inactive. On contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), the native density of all tumours was higher than 10 Hounsfield Units (HU), and the absolute percentage washout (APW) and relative percentage washout (RPW) were lower than 60% and 40%, respectively. The most common findings were adrenal adenoma (25.9%), macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (16.9%), ganglioneuroma (15.6%), and haemorrhage with posthaemorrhagic changes (13%). In total, there were 12 various histopathological diagnoses in this group. There were only 2 (2.6%) malignant (adrenal cancer and leiomyosarcoma) and 3 (3.9%) potentially malignant (pheochromocytoma) lesions in this group. It is often impossible to make a correct diagnosis in a clinical setting until it is histologically verified. \"Nonadenoma\" adrenal tumours constitute a heterogeneous group including very rare pathologies. The risk of malignancy in indeterminate adrenal tumours is relatively low. ","73":"The biochemical diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) uses assays of specific and nonspecific markers. Nonspecific markers include, among others, neuron-specific enolase (NSE). The aim of this study was to evaluate NSE in patients with midgut type tumours treated with somatostatin analogues. The study group of patients with NETs of the small intestine included 41 patients. Grade G1 was found in 19 cases, while G2 was seen in the remaining 22 cases. Liver metastases were found in all patients studied. The examined group of patients was treated with somatostatin analogues receiving octreotide LAR at a dose of 30 mg. The control of biochemical parameters was performed every 3 months and imaging examinations every 6 months. The Immuno-Biological Laboratories kit was used for determination of NSE concentration, where reference values were 12.5-25 ng\/mL. In the G1 group of patients, the median value of NSE concentration was 134.67 ng\/mL, while in the G2 group, the value was 234.55 ng\/mL and was significantly higher than in the G1 group (p = 0.003). In the determination of NSE concentration values according to the degree of liver involvement, in the group of patients with 10% liver involvement, the median value of NSE concentration was 143.21 ng\/mL, while in the group with 25% liver involvement, the value was 251.82 ng\/mL (p &lt; 0.001). In the analysis of NSE concentration assessment in patients with disease progression, the median value was 234.65 ng\/mL compared to the group with disease stabilization, where the median NSE value was significantly lower and amounted to 136.27 ng\/mL (p &lt; 0.001). In our study, we observed that NSE concentration values were significantly higher among patients with NET midgut type tumour with histological grade G2 and in patients with 25% liver involvement and progression of the disease process.

Zonulin is a physiological tight junction modulator and an intestinal permeability marker. In this study we aimed to investigate serum levels of zonulin and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and different levels of albuminuria. Ninety patients with T2DM and 30 healthy controls (HC) aged between 18 and 65 years were enrolled in the study. T2DM patients were divided into three groups as patients with normoalbuminuria (n = 30), microalbuminuria (n = 30), and macroalbuminuria (n = 30). Serum zonulin and IL-6 levels were measured by ELISA method. There was no significant difference between groups in terms of age, gender, serum ALT, LDL-C, HDL-C, and zonulin levels (p &gt; 0.05). Significant differences between groups were present for the duration of diabetes (p &lt; 0.001), body mass index (p &lt; 0.001), fasting blood glucose (p &lt; 0.001), creatinine (p &lt; 0.001), uric acid (p = 0.037), triglyceride (p = 0.003), total cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001), glycated haemoglobin (p &lt; 0.001), and IL-6 (p &lt; 0.001) levels. IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria groups compared to the HC group, but no significant difference was determined between the HC and normoalbuminuria group. In patients with diabetic kidney disease, a significant positive correlation was found between zonulin with IL-6 and proteinuria (rho = 0.296, p = 0.008; rho = 0.190, p &lt; 0.047, respectively). The serum IL-6 level was positively correlated with microalbuminuria and proteinuria (rho = 0.451, p &lt; 0.001; rho = 0.425, p &lt; 0.001, respectively).

These alterations may be presumed on the basis of the following two observations. Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system (RAS) element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the downregulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of COVID-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the COVID-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of COVID-19 strongly depends on the age of the patient. Age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially those of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone, may contribute to morbidity\/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors\/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs thorough clinical trials.","88":null,"89":"Over the past several years new evidence on the management of hypothyroidism has emerged, which has influenced recommendations from professional bodies. The presentation of hypothyroid patients has also changed, and new cases are increasingly diagnosed by indiscriminate screening, often identifying cases with minor biochemical disturbances. Little is known about the physician responses and attitudes to this changing landscape. THESIS (Treatment of Hypothyroidism in Europe by Specialists: an International Survey) is a large-scale survey of European physicians who treat patients with hypothyroidism. Here we document current practices of Polish physicians relating to the use of thyroid hormones in hypothyroid and euthyroid patients. Members of the Polish Society of Endocrinology were invited to participate in the web-based THESIS survey. In total 423 (54.6% of the 774 invited) physicians completed the survey. The majority of respondents (74.2%) would prescribe thyroid hormones foreuthyroid patients for certain indications, such as female infertility with elevated thyroid antibodies (63.4%), simple goitre (40.9%), unexplained fatigue (12.1%), obesity (9.7%), hypercholesterolaemia (9.0%), and depression (9.2%). Nearly all physicians (96.0%) declared that the treatment of choice for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4). However, around one-third (30.3%) were also using LT4 and liothyronine (LT3) combination treatment; LT3 alone was rarely prescribed (1.7%), and none prescribed desiccated thyroid extract. The majority of respondents preferred LT4 tablets. Among alternative formulations, liquid LT4 was most commonly recommended for patients unable to take LT4 in the fasting state (26.0%) and patients with malabsorption (19.9%). Respondents considered prescribing dietary supplements (such as selenium and iodine) in hypothyroid patients with coexisting autoimmune thyroiditis (29.6%) or at the patients' request (32.2%). LT4 + LT3 combination therapy was used by 32.2% when symptoms persisted notwithstanding normal serum TSH concentration. Psychosocial factors, comorbidities, and the burden of chronic disease were considered as the most likely causes of persistent symptoms. Apart from clinical practice recommendations, other factors influence the thyroid hormone therapy patterns. Moreover, certain areas of clinical practice were identified (the use of thyroid hormones in euthyroid subjects and the use of dietary supplements), which are not in accordance with the current evidence. ","90":"The aim of the current work was to review the clinical profile, aetiological classification, as well as the management of Egyptian paediatric patients with disorders of sex development (DSD) presenting at a tertiary centre in Cairo. The study was a cross-sectional observational study that included Egyptian patients who attended the Endocrinology clinic during a period of one year from January to December 2019. All patients with overt genital ambiguity aged from 0 to 18 years were recruited in the study. Diagnosis of DSD was based on clinical features and hormonal profile. Out of 100 patients, 71% had 46XY DSD, 24% had 46XX DSD, while sex chromosome DSD was identified in 5%. The median age of presentation was 12 months with 19% presented during infancy. The most common cause of 46XY DSD was due to either defect in androgen synthesis or action (40%) with the majority due to androgen insensitivity syndrome (28%). Most of the 46XX DSD (21\/24) patients were diagnosed as classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia secondary to deficiency of 21 hydroxylase enzyme, with 90% being salt wasters. Our series revealed that 46XY DSD was the most frequent DSD aetiological diagnosis, with androgen insensitivity syndrome representing the commonest cause. CAH with classic salt wasting type was the second most common disorder. Management of children with DSD is challenging especially with lack of adequate resources. The crucial issues that stand against proper diagnosis and management are late presentation combined with economic constrains, and social and cultural issues. ","91":"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an endocrine disease that poses a risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Atrial electromechanical delay (EMD) has been known as an early marker of atrial fibrillation (AF). This study aimed to evaluate the atrial EMD in PHPT. Fifty PHPT patients (45 females, 5 males) aged 30-75 years and 38 controls (35 females, 3 males) aged 31-73 years were included in the study. Atrial EMD parameters were measured by using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Inter-atrial EMD was calculated as the difference between PA lateral and PA tricuspid; intra-atrial EMD was calculated as the difference between PA septum and PA tricuspid, and left-atrial EMD was calculated as the difference between PA lateral and PA septum. Atrial EMD parameters (PA lateral, PA septum, PA tricuspid) significantly increased in the PHPT group compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001, for all). Also, inter-atrial and intra-atrial EMD were higher in the PHPT group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.001, for all). In correlation analysis, calcium was closely associated with PA lateral (r = 0.749, p &lt; 0.001), PA septum (r = 0.735, p &lt; 0.001), inter-atrial EMD (r = 0.807, p &lt; 0.001), and intra-atrial EMD (r = 0.838, p &lt; 0.001). The same correlation relationship was seen between PTH levels with PA lateral (r = 671, p &lt; 0.001), PA septum (r = 0.660, p &lt; 0,001), inter-atrial EMD (r = 0.674, p &lt; 0.001), and intra-atrial EMD (r = 0.732, p &lt; 0.001).

There are no data regarding PTH concentration kinetics in critically ill patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) in an intensive care setting. The primary objective of this study was to investigate trends in PTH serum levels in critically ill patients with multiorgan failure undergoing CRRT, by performing periodic PTH measurements in the acute phase of critical illness. This was a single-centre, prospective, observational study conducted in an mixed, university-affiliated intensive care unit. Critically ill patients who fulfilled all of the following criteria were included: respiratory failure; circulatory failure; acute kidney injury treated by CRRT; and sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score) of 5 or more. Patients who met any of the following criteria were excluded: acute liver failure; hypercalcemia at admission (total calcium serum level &gt; 10.6 mg\/dL; total ionized calcium plasma level &gt; 1.35 mmol\/L); parathyroid gland disease; end-stage renal disease; patients undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedures; aged under 18 years; pregnant; and life expectancy after admission to the intensive care unit anticipated to be less than 72 hours as assessed by the investigator. Thirty patients met the inclusion criteria. A statistically significant change in PTH over time was observed (Friedman ANOVA; p = 0.0001). The post-hoc test showed a statistically significant decrease in PTH: measurements 5-8 relative to measurement 1, and measurements 4-8 relative to measurement 2 (p &lt; 0.05). No significant correlations between 25 hydroxyvitamin D3 deficiency, age, diagnosis, SOFA score, and PTH levels were observed. A statistical test indicated that serum concentrations of PTH were significantly higher in the de novo sepsis group (p &lt; 0.05). The PTH serum concentration decreases during the course of CRRT in the majority of patients. When the course of the disease starts to be complicated by sepsis, PTH serum levels then remain high. A probable reason for this is the existence of the inflammatory state triggered by sepsis.

In the era of pandemic, during which an epidemiological regime and social distancing are constantly recommended, and routine medical care and planned surgical procedures have been postponed or significantly reduced, patients and their physicians have to struggle on a daily basis with difficult access to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. This is a great challenge for both groups. The aim of this study is to assess the current state of knowledge about thyreological diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide indications for the introduced therapeutic changes on the basis of recent scientific literature published up to December 2020 and searches of the PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases, which searched for keywords related to SARS-CoV-2 and its influence on thyreology problems.

The majority of Europe is depleted of natural Se sources, and the daily population intake does not comply with recommended values. Optimal individual plasma Se concentration is reached when the selenoproteins (selenoprotein P, glutathione peroxidase) are fully saturated. However, Se intake has to be regulated because both Se shortage and overdose negatively impact health. In the case of AIT, Se may alleviate symptoms or prevent progression to hypothyroidism and postpartum hypothyroidism. Se supplementation in euthyroid, subclinical, or overt hypothyroid AIT patients decreased thyroid autoantibodies, lowered or maintained the TSH level, decreased the fT4\/fT3 ratio, reduced the body's oxidative stress and inflammatory status, and amended quality of life and thyroid ultrasound structure and volume. In pregnant females, adequate Se intake protected them against miscarriages, preeclampsia\/hypertension, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age infants' birth, and improved child's neuropsychological development. In the elderly population, adequate Se supplementation decreased cardiovascular diseases and hypertension risk, but prolonged intake of excessive doses increased the all-cause mortality rate. Routine Se supplementation implementation requires from researchers and clinicians consideration of specific populational differences in natural Se and iodine supply, the patient's clinical situation (supplementation simultaneously or before levothyroxine treatment, AIT\/non-AIT hypothyroidism), individual response to supplementation (Se and selenoprotein P assessment), predisposition (genetic testing), the status of other trace elements, and the interplay between those micronutrients. Moreover, the safety of commercially available Se formulations, doses, and duration of treatment should be determined. Proper guidelines are warranted to standardise the medical approach to Se supplementation. This article presents a comprehensive review of recent randomised-controlled trials, meta-analyses, and clinical trials concerning the risks and benefits of Se supplementation in different clinical settings and specific populations with particular emphasis on AIT in a practical manner.","104":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has an excellent prognosis with a relatively low mortality rate, but a small portion of PTC patients suffer from an aggressive form of the disease. In such cases early detection of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is as paramount as it is problematic. The routine use of central neck lymph node dissection is not recommended. New methods to detect LNM are needed. MicroRNAs are a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of PTC. In this review we summarise the current knowledge regarding dysregulated miRNAs and their association with LNM in PTS patients. The PubMed and EBSCO databases were searched using terms for \"microRNA\", \"thyroid carcinoma\", and \"prognosis\" by using Boolean operators. Based on eligibility and exclusion criteria, articles were screened and reviewed in full, methodological data of included studies were extracted, and risk of bias analysis performed. In total, 446 unique studies were extracted from the mentioned databases, and based on inclusion and exclusion criteria 27 studies were included in this review. Of them 17 analysed tissue microRNAs, 5 analysed circulating microRNAs, and 5 studies analysed both tissue and circulating samples. MiRNA-146B, miRNA-221, miRNA-222, miRNA-21, miRNA-204, miRNA-451, miRNA-199a-3p, and miRNA-30a-3p were dysregulated in at least 2 separate studies. A sizable portion of studies failed to show statistically significant differences in miRNA expression between LNM-positive and -negative patients. Different methodologies and disparities of patient populations could explain these discrepancies.\\ This research supports the statement that specific up- and downregulated miRNAs are associated with LNM in PTC patients. However, the prognostic value of these miRNAs is limited. Additional targeted cohort studies are required to elucidate the role of miRNAs in defining individualised treatment strategies for thyroid cancer patients.","105":"","106":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are part of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. This review describes some miRNAs whose expression is modified in obesity and that may be involved in the development of insulin resistance. The metabolic alterations associated with obesity are due to an adipose tissue dysfunction. miRNAs are a mechanism that regulates gene expression, one miRNA can regulate the expression up to a thousand genes, and at the same time one gene can be regulated by several miRNAs; moreover, miRNA expression is tissue specific. Obesity leads to a dysregulation of miRNA expression in adipose tissue, and changes in miRNA expression relate to changes in gene expression related to the development of insulin resistance. However, because miRNA can be exported to the extracellular medium through exosomes, proteins, and lipoproteins, miRNA can be found in extracellular fluids like blood, urine, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid. Considering the above, miRNA have been proposed as biological markers of different diseases, and also as potential therapeutic targets.","107":"Cushing's syndrome (CS) causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anovulatory infertility due to hypercortisolism, and it is very rare in pregnancy.

The results showed different perspectives, but the evidence is in favour of a multifold immunohistochemical analysis that must include pituitary transcription factors for a highly accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and guidance of (multimodal) therapy. By using transcription factors, the understanding of the structure and function of the recently defined pituitary neuroendocrine tumours has made significant progress.

Because of its heterogeneity and inconsistent reporting, atypia of undetermined significance or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS\/FLUS), known as Bethesda category III, is the most controversial category. Thyroid nodules that fall within Bethesda categories III-IV have an overall risk of malignancy of between 15 and 40%. The aim of this study was to determine the malignancy rate in Bethesda III nodules. A retrospective study was performed for 1166 patients who underwent thyroid surgery for multinodular goitre (MNG) or solitary nodular goitre (SNG) in our institution between June 2010 and May 2020. Data retrieved included demographic characteristics of the patients, FNB cytology, thyroid function test results, type of thyroidectomy, and final histology results.

","126":"Thyroid dysfunction and gestational diabetes (GDM) are the two most common endocrine disorders that can be observed during pregnancy. Thyroid function abnormalities can be associated with insulin resistance (IR) and changes in carbohydrate metabolism. In patients with type 1 diabetes, thyroid function is usually evaluated to rule out abnormalities within a second autoimmune disease. Patients with type 2 diabetes are tested for thyroid function in view of the associated weight gain, IR, and changes in metabolism. The question arises: Should we also look for thyroid dysfunction in patients with gestational diabetes? The aim of the study was to determine whether there are abnormalities in thyroid hormone levels in pregnant women with gestational diabetes. A monocentric, retrospective study of the Dr Shterev Hospital electronic database was performed. We analysed the medical records of 662 pregnant women, divided in two groups - 412 with GDM and 250 with normal glucose tolerance, who gave birth in the period 2017-2019. Gestational diabetes mellitus in the study group was diagnosed with a 2-h, 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. We analysed the mean serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), FT3:FT4 ratio, fasting plasma glucose, age and body mass index in both groups. The groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. In patients who developed GDM, significantly higher concentrations of TSH (p &lt; 0.0001) and FT3 (p &lt; 0.0001), lower concentrations of FT4 (p &lt; 0.0001), and higher FT3:FT4 ratios (p &lt; 0.0001) were found.

Late complications of this disease include cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and endocrine disorders. Data from the literature on thyroid disorders in patients with HH are inconsistent and ambiguous, and no research has been done to determine the relationship between excessive accumulation of iron and the thyroid morphology. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterise thyroid function and ultrasound images in patients with clinically overt hereditary haemochromatosis. We studied 40 patients who were diagnosed with hereditary haemochromatosis with one of the mutations of the HFE gene and iron deposits in liver in specimen from liver biopsies (graded G2 to G4) or in MRI. To assess thyroid function, ultrasound examinations of the thyroid gland were performed and serum TSH concentrations were measured.

However, patients with more severe iron deposits in liver showed lower TSH concentration. Our results indicate lower incidence of focal lesions in thyroid gland in a group of patients with clinically overt hereditary haemochromatosis.

Kisspeptins, which perform their activity through KISS1 receptor (KISS1R), are recognised as metastatic suppressors in many malignant tumours. This study aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of kisspeptin and KISS1R in different types of PitNETs and to compare it with the expression in the normal anterior pituitary, using tissue microarray. The experimental group consisted of 101 patients with PitNETs, with 45 (37.3%) being of gonadotroph, 40 (33.9%) somatotroph, 4 (3.4%) corticotroph, 4 (3.4%) thyrotroph, 3 (2.5%) lactotroph, and 6 (5.1%) null-cell type. The control group consisted of anterior pituitary tissue accidentally removed during the surgery for PitNETs in 17 patients. Kisspeptin expression was observed in both experimental and control groups, without statistically significant differences in the staining intensity. Negative kisspeptin staining was detected in 10 (9.9%), weak in 79 (78.2%), and moderate in 12 tumours (11.9%); none of the tumours had strong staining intensity. The weak staining intensity was predominant in all PitNET types except thyrotroph tumours. Significant statistical difference in terms of kisspeptin expression between types of PitNET and the control group was not observed. Immunohistochemical expression of KISS1R was not observed in the control group or in the experimental group. We conclude that immunohistochemistry, as a method, cannot confirm the involvement of kisspeptin in tumourigenesis and aggressiveness of PitNETs, but potentially supports its antimetastatic role. The absence of KISS1R immunohistochemical expression in all anterior pituitaries and PitNETs in our cohort needs verification through the use of different procedures designed for the detection of the presence and localisation of proteins in the cell. ","134":"Male infertility is the cause of couples' infertility in about 50% of cases. Current recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility advance thorough medical history taking and physical examination, to provide the basis for further genetic evaluation. The extent of genetic testing itself depends on the semen analysis results, which allow the risk of inheritance of chromosomal aberrations to be determined and the root causes of habitual miscarriages to be explained. In azoospermia, once the type of microdeletion has been identified, a decision can be made as to whether a testicular biopsy is required to obtain sperm for the artificial reproductive technology (ART) procedure. The physical examination, genetic interview, and hormonal results are helpful in deciding which genetic tests to perform. Our research facilitates genetic testing in the diagnosis of male infertility.","135":"Thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) laboratory tests are commonly used worldwide, and their results have an important influence on decisions about treatment and further diagnostic processes. Any discrepancies between symptoms and laboratory results or between results of different tests should be closely investigated to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Inconsistencies in hormone tests might be a result of physiological changes in hormonal balance, a disease, drug intake, or laboratory interference. Major factors that interfere with thyroid function tests are: heterophilic antibodies, macro TSH, biotin, thyroid hormones autoantibodies, anti-streptavidin, and anti-ruthenium antibodies. In this paper we discuss the influence of different factors on the procedures of hormonal immunoassays, as well as methods to minimise the risk of false results and misdiagnoses.","136":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains the leading cause of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the most common reason for renal replacement therapy. Research has been carried out for years to find a marker that would enable early identification of people at risk of DKD occurrence, as well as people who will progress from DKD to ESRD. With regard to daily medical practice, the only existing prognostic biomarkers in DKD remain urine albumin-creatinine ratio based on the urinary assessment of albumin and creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate - on the basis of serum creatinine concentration. The development of other biomarkers that would enable the identification of patients at risk of DKD, the stratification of the risk of progression to ESRD, as well as the creation of personalised therapy is currently of great interest.

Hypothyroid patients present increased levels of creatine kinase (CK), indicating muscle destruction. Lately, we proposed new serum markers of muscle disturbances in thyroid disorders: titin (TTN) and dystrophin (DMD). The aim of this study is to determine the association between thyroid status, muscle metabolism, and serum levels of TTN and DMD in patients affected by hypoand hyperthyroidism, before and after the treatment. In the study 56 subjects were enrolled. The studied group consisted of 16 patients with newly diagnosed overt hypothyroidism and 20 patients with hyperthyroidism. Twenty healthy controls were also included in the study. Body composition, thyroid hormones, and biochemical markers of muscle deterioration levels were evaluated before and after restoration of euthyroidism. Dystrophin and TTN levels were noticeably lower in the hypothyroid group and hyperthyroid group in comparison with controls, at the border of statistical significance. Along with the thyroid hormones and CK normalisation, DMD levels increased in the hypothyroid group, with no significant lowering of TTN levels. However, TTN concentrations and the fT3\/fT4 ratio became significantly lower than in controls. Hyperthyroid patients experienced no significant changes in TTN and DMD. The presented data indicate that TTN and DMD are potential new markers of musculoskeletal deterioration in thyroid disorders. In addition, the shift in TTN and DMD serum concentrations after the treatment of hypothyroidism accompanied by decreased fT3\/fT4 ratio suggest the influence of the chosen therapeutic approach on muscle metabolism. ","139":"Clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) are common tumours of the pituitary gland and are mainly considered as benign. The primary aim of this study was to research the effects of NFPA on genome instability in patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma by using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay and 8-hydroxy- 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) assay. The second objective of this study was to assess whether there is a relationship between age, pituitary adenoma diameters, 8-OHDG levels, CBMN site assay parameters, and tumour aggressiveness. The study was performed on 30 patients who had been diagnosed with NFPA and were admitted to the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, and 20 healthy subjects of similar age and sex. Micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs), nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies, and apoptotic and necrotic cell frequencies in patients with NFPA were found to be significantly higher than in control subjects, and plasma 8-OHdG levels in patients with NFPA were statistically significantly lower than control subjects in this study. It is believed that this is the first study to evaluate the aggressiveness of tumour with chromosome\/oxidative DNA damage in patients with NFPA. However, further studies are needed in order to understand the cause of NFPA aggression and to evaluate these patients in terms of risk of cancer.

There is a continuous need to conduct stroke pathogenesis studies. A certain role here can be attributed to adipose-derived hormones. The aim of this paper is to assess the blood concentration for selected adipocytokines: omentin-1, irisin, protein-1 related with C1q\/TNF (CTRP1), vaspin and nesfatin-1 in IS patients, and an attempt to define their role as risk factors for ischaemic stroke. The study included 46 patients with ischaemic stroke (27 females, 19 males, average 67.6 years of age). The control group consisted of 32 patients (16 females, 16 males, average 64.1 years of age) who had never had cerebrovascular diseases. The concentration of omentin-1 and CTRP1 in the group of stroke patients was higher than in the control group, whereas the concentrations of nesfatin-1 and irisin was significantly lower than in the control group. The vaspin level was similar in both groups of patients. Statistical analysis using logistic regression allows us to find that CTRP1 can be a significant stroke risk factor. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between the concentration of CTRP1 and NIHSS. However, no correlation between the concentration of other adipocytokines under investigation and the severity of ischaemic stroke was found. From among the adipocytokines under investigation, higher concentrations of omentin-1 and CTRP1 and lower blood concentrations of nesfatin-1, irisin significantly increase the odds of getting to the group of ischaemic patients. It seems that CTRP1 can be an independent predictive factor of IS. ","145":"There is an intimate and functional relationship between the cardiovascular system and the thyroid gland; from sharing the same embryologic origin to modulating each of the components of the heart for a normal function. Due to this relationship, patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases often undergo a thyroid function test to rule out hypo- or hyperthyroidism. The signs and symptoms of hyper- and hypothyroidism are clinically relevant and profound. The cardiac function changes can be explained through the cellular mechanism of the thyroid hormone action on the heart. Minor alteration of thyroid hormone can change vascular resistance, cardiac contractility, blood pressure, and heart rhythm, because of the presence of the thyroid hormone receptors on these tissues. A better understanding of the impact of thyroid hormones on the cardiovascular system is paramount for physicians to make a quick decision and initiate a treatment plan because it has been shown to reverse some of the cardiac changes such as systolic and diastolic dysfunction. With this literature review, we aim to describe the holistic effect of thyroid hormones on the cardiovascular system, from its effect on a cellular level to changes in cardiac functions in subclinical and overt hypo\/hyperthyroidism. Additionally, we will describe the effects of the drug treatment regimen of thyroid on the cardiac function.","146":"Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder affecting 3-15% of the adult population in subclinical form and 0.3-0.8% as overt disease. The mainstay of treatment is replacement monotherapy with levothyroxine (LT4). Currently several oral LT4 formulations including tablets, softgel capsules, and liquid formulations are available. Liquid LT4 is manufactured as LT4 solution in 85% glycerol and 96% ethanol and as LT4 solution in purified water and glycerol. The latest formulation, Tirosint SOL, gained FDA approval in 2017. To evaluate the clinical utility of liquid LT4 we reviewed the literature using three databases: PubMed\/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase and found 405 articles among which 23 prospective and two retrospective studies were further evaluated. Finally, several case reports on rare clinical conditions were discussed. Our review demonstrated that liquid LT4 was more effective than tablet formulation in patients with malabsorption caused by interfering diseases, drugs, and bariatric surgery. The better pharmacokinetics of liquid LT4 was also confirmed in subjects without malabsorption: patients on replacement or suppressive therapy, who switched from tablet to liquid formulation in equivalent dose, gained better hormonal control, and required less frequent TSH measurements. The drug also appeared effective and easy to handle in patients fed by enteric tube. Liquid LT4 appeared equally effective whenever taken before or during breakfast. The analysis of the drug utility in particular populations including newborns, pregnant women, and the elderly confirmed the high value and safety of liquid LT4. However, in neonates the higher incidence of TSH suppression on liquid in comparison to tablet LT4 therapy was noted, and particular attention to avoid over-treatment must be paid. Concluding: the literature review revealed that liquid LT4 is especially advantageous in patients with malabsorption and the critically ill, but it seems also very promising in common therapy. The lack of alcohol content in the new formulation makes Tirosint SOL especially attractive.","147":"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), as a family of transcription factors involved in the cellular response to hypoxia, are key regulatory factors in the regulation mechanism of an organism's response to hypoxia.

Therefore, it is of great significance to further study HIFs to understand and treat tumours or other related diseases. This paper summarises the structure, oxygen-dependent degradation mechanism, non-oxygen-dependent degradation mechanism, transcriptional activation mechanism, relevant signalling pathways, and inhibitors of HIFs, in order to provide new clues for the treatment of tumour, vascular, and other related diseases.","148":"The potential effect of adipokines on the development of AF is yet to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of baseline serum adipokines with 1) the presence of AF at baseline and 2) future risk of AF development. The current study is a sub-analysis of the prospective, randomised AVOCADO (Aspirin Vs.\/Or Clopidogrel in Aspirin-resistant Diabetics inflammation Outcomes) trial. The AVOCADO study included patients with type 2 DM burdened with at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors and receiving acetylsalicylic acid. In patients included in the current analysis adipokines and inflammatory biomarker levels were measured. Information on the subsequent AF diagnosis was collected after a median of 5.4 years of follow-up. A total of 273 patients with type 2 DM (median age 68 years; 52% male) were included in the initial analysis comparing patients with and without AF at baseline. Patients with diagnosed AF (12%) had higher levels of serum resistin [8.5 (5.8-10.5) vs. 6.9 (5.6-8.7) ng\/mL; p = 0.034], adiponectin [6.9 (5.6-8.7) vs. 2.7 (1.8-4.2) ng\/mL; p = 0.032], and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [336 (148-473) vs. 108 [45-217]; p &lt; 0.001) than non-AF patients. There were no significant differences in serum leptin, IL-6, and TNF-alpha concentrations between the two groups. From subjects without known AF at study entry, 19% developed AF at follow-up. In logistic regression analysis, baseline adipokine levels did not predict AF development. In type 2 DM, patients with AF have higher resistin and adiponectin concentrations than patients with no AF.

In 10 cases, surgery was performed for pheochromocytoma, eight cases involved Conn's syndrome, and in four cases - paragangliomas located in the para-adrenal region. Secretory activity was identified in all cases. Laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy was performed in 20 patients. Conversion to open laparotomy was necessary in two cases. In patients after bilateral resection of pheochromocytoma surgery, glucocorticoids were supplemented for six weeks. No significant surgical complications were observed in this group. Partial adrenalectomy for minor lesions should be a much more commonly utilised treatment method (of choice).

This complication is not always due to inappropriate surgical technique. The goal of this work was to find the relationship between cellular ploidy and proliferative activity of adenomas and hyperplasia of parathyroids and preoperative levels of calcium and parathormone in the serum of patients surgically treated for primary hyperparathyroidism. A total of 98 parathyroid glands were tested, of which 81 (82.7%) were from female patients and 17 (17.3%) from male; the age of the patients was from 22 to 82 years, with an average of 58 years.

Surgical treatment with bilateral adrenalectomy inevitably leads to life-long hormonal dependence, which significantly affects quality of life. The development of minimally invasive adrenal surgery has created a chance to preserve adrenal cortex function in these patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety of laparoscopic cortical-sparing adrenal surgeries and their efficacy in the prevention of postoperative adrenal insufficiency in patients with hereditary pheochromocytomas. We retrospectively analysed the medical histories of 10 patients, who underwent 10 laparoscopic cortical sparing adrenal surgeries from January 2015 to January 2019 in our centre. The decision to perform sparing surgery was based on preoperative diagnosis of hereditary syndrome in line with the result of DNA analysis or its diagnosis based on the clinical appearance. All surgeries were performed laparoscopically from transperitoneal access in the lateral decubitus position, with preserving 1\/3-1\/4 adrenal tissue. The sufficiency of remnant adrenal tissue was assessed in all patients. The median time of follow-up was three years (ranged 0.5-4 years). No intraoperative complications were observed. One case of acute heart failure was the only early postoperative adverse event. There were no late postoperative complications and no local recurrences observed. In one out of three patients undergoing sparing surgery as a second procedure after former total adrenalectomy, adrenal cortex failure occurred. In all patients after unilateral surgery or after bilateral surgery performed simultaneously (total adrenalectomy at one side and sparing surgery contralaterally), function of remnant adrenal tissue was preserved. In hereditary pheochromocytomas, with minimal risk of malignant process, laparoscopic cortical sparing adrenal surgeries are the safe approach and provide the chance to preserve adrenal cortex function.

However, semaphorin 6B (SEMA6B) has not yet been extensively reported in cancers, especially in thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid carcinoma RNA-Seq dataset from the TCGA database was used to assess the expression of SEMA6B in tissues, as well as its clinical significance. We adopted qRT-PCR and western blot analyses to measure the mRNA and protein expression of SEMA6B in thyroid carcinoma cells. The biological roles of SEMA6B in thyroid carcinoma cells were examined through cell counting kit 8, clone formation, and Transwell assays. Also, GSEA was used to identify the gene sets modulated by SEMA6B, which is further verified by western blot. According to the public dataset from the TCGA database, we found that the expression of SEMA6B was upregulated in thyroid carcinoma tissues compared to adjacent non-tumour tissues, and a high level of SEMA6B resulted in a poorer prognosis compared to the low-level SEMA6B group. Functional experiments showed that silencing SEMA6B suppressed the B-CPAP cells viability, invasiveness, and motility, whereas up-regulating SEMA6B in FTC-133 cells led to opposite outcomes. Furthermore, knockdown of SEMA6B in B-CPAP cells could significantly elevate the protein expression of NUMB and reduce the expression of NOTCH1, HES1, and Cyclin D1. Conversely, overexpression of SEMA6B in FTC-133 cells presented opposite results on the protein expression of these Notch signalling pathway-related markers. Our findings demonstrated that SEMA6B exerts a tumourigenic effect in thyroid carcinoma partly by activating Notch signalling pathway, which provides a possible biomarker for the therapeutic intervention in thyroid carcinoma.

Available data are conflicting to what extent adult thyroid dysfunction is associated with IR. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association and to identify which thyroid parameters are predictors of IR. After undergoing basic anthropometric and biochemical studies including thyroid hormones, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and insulin, 1425 middle-aged individuals were divided into three groups according to thyroid parameters: overt hypothyroidism (OH), subclinical hypothyroidism (SH), and euthyroidism (EU). The homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), fasting insulin, and two-hour glucose levels of OGTT showed a steady, yet insignificant, increase from EU through SH to OH. The strongest noted correlations were those of insulin levels with free triiodothyronine\/free thyroxine (FT3\/FT4) ratio (r = 0.206, p &lt; 0.001) and FT3 (r = 0.205, p &lt; 0.001).

Thyroid-stimulating hormone was not associated with IR in either correlation or regression analysis. The FT3\/FT4 ratio should be more emphasised in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disorders. Patients could benefit from a pharmacological reduction of the FT3\/FT4 ratio, potentially leading to a decrease in insulin resistance, and thus a corresponding decrease in the risk of the cardiometabolic diseases.

Compared with the non-diabetic group, the proportion of patients in the diabetic group with chronic underlying disease was higher, and they were in more a serious condition at admission. Inflammation index and characteristics of glycolipid metabolism results showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus were more likely to have elevated inflammatory markers and hypercoagulability, accompanied by hypoproteinaemia and glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. Treatment and clinic outcome results showed that the time of nucleic acid turning negative in the diabetic group was significantly longer than that in the non-diabetic group. Radiological data showed that COVID-19 combined with diabetes prolonged the time of detoxification in patients. COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic hypertension are associated with increased inflammatory markers and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of TRAb at the initial diagnosis of GD with the clinical and laboratory parameters in a large number of patients with GD and to compare the clinical and laboratory parameters between patients with high TRAb levels and TRAb-negative patients. This study included 440 patients [326 (74%) female, 114 (26%) male]. All patients were classified according to gender, age, smoking habit, and TRAb levels. TRAb levels were significantly higher in male compared to female patients and in smokers compared to non-smokers. Smoking male patients had the highest TRAb levels. In regression analysis, goiter size, male gender, cigarette smoking, Graves' orbitopathy, fT3, and anti-TPO antibody levels were independently associated with high TRAb levels, while age at diagnosis and fT4 levels were not independently associated with high TRAb levels. TRAb-negative GD was diagnosed in 80 (18%) patients. TRA-negative patients had markedly less severe clinical and laboratory hyperthyroidism compared to patients with high TRAb levels. Moreover, the smoking habit was significantly lower in patients with TRAb-negative GD. According to our study results, TRAb levels at the initial diagnosis of GD are differently associated with clinical and laboratory parameters. Male patients and smoking patients with GD tended to have markedly higher TRAb levels and more severe clinical hyperthyroidism. Therefore, besides other contributing factors, male gender and smoking may affect TRAb levels and consequently the severity of hyperthyroidism in patients with GD.

Nephritis in the course of this disease (IgAVN) is observed in 30-50% of patients and might lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Finding a non-invasive biomarker to distinguish initially between patients with and without nephritis and to facilitate a therapeutic decision to reduce the risk of long-term renal impairment is currently the target of much research. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adiponectin concentration in children with IgAV and estimate whether it might be used as a marker of IgAVN. The study involved 29 IgAV children and 34 healthy controls. Eleven (38%) patients had renal involvement (IgAV-N) and 18 (62%) did not exhibit nephritis (IgAV-noN). The serum adiponectin level was estimated in children in an acute phase of IgAV and after 2-6 months during a follow-up visit.

The concentration of adiponectin in serum was significantly higher in children with acute phase of IgAV as compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001), and in patients without renal involvement in comparison with IgAV-N children (p &lt; 0.049). In analysis of correlation we found a negative relationship between adiponectin level and serum creatinine concentration (r = -0.437, p = 0.02). The logistic regression evaluation demonstrated that a low adiponectin level increased the risk of nephritis in the course of IgAV.

The second objective was to analyse the correlation between results of REMS and classical dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in acromegaly patients. We enrolled 33 patients with acromegaly (AG) and 24 controls (CG). The acromegaly patients were divided into two subgroups: well-controlled acromegaly (WCA) and surgery-cured acromegaly (SCA). REMS was performed in all participants, while DXA was performed only in the acromegaly group. IGF-I and GH levels were measured in acromegaly patients. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (LS) and the femoral neck (FN) obtained from REMS did not reveal significant differences between AG, CG, WCA, and SCA. Similarly, there were no significant differences in BMD measured by DXA at the LS and at the FN between WCA and SCA. Significant positive correlations between IGF-I concentrations and BMD obtained from both REMS and DXA were detected in the AG and WCA.

There is no literature information available in humans to demonstrate how blood and saliva asprosin levels of patients with the newly identified type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) changed after metformin treatment. We aim to examine these changes and contribute to the literature in this sense. A total of 60 individuals: 30 healthy volunteers and 30 newly identified cases of T2DM whose treatment had been initiated, were included in the investigation. Blood and saliva sample specimens were carefully taken from both groups. Saliva asprosin and serum levels were tested using the ELISA method. Immunohistochemical methods were used to test asprosin formation sites in salivary gland tissues. Similarly increased asprosin levels were observed in patients from the newly diagnosed T2DM group compared with the healthy control group (p = 0.003). In the newly defined T2DM group, blood asprosin levels decreased significantly after three months of metformin treatment (p = 0.032). In terms of saliva asprosin levels, when the healthy control group and the newly identified T2DM group were compared, saliva asprosin levels were found to be higher in the newly identified T2DM group (p &lt; 0.001). With immunohistochemical staining, asprosin immunoreactivity was observed in the submandibular and parotid glands. In our study, serum and saliva asprosin levels increased significantly in the newly identified individuals with type 2 diabetes, which suggests that asprosin could form a critical risk related to T2DM. Higher asprosin levels are an important marker for predicting diabetes development, and that this hormone can be signified as a main or target molecule in the treatment of diabetes.

Data on the predictive factors for the recurrence of the disease are limited in comparison with those for the adult population. The identification of the predictive factors for CD recurrence in patients after surgical treatment in childhood was the aim of the presented study. A retrospective analysis of 26 CD patients, mean age at the time of diagnosis 13.46 years, treated at the Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI) in the years 1994-2018. Two time points were set at which the follow-up (FU) of patients was finished. The first time point (shorter FU, 24 patients) was set when the patients completed their treatment at the CMHI. The second time point (longer FU, 26 patients) was determined on the basis on the time when adult patients (previous CMHI patients) completed the author's questionnaire. In the case of the other patients (current CMHI paediatric patients and patients who did not respond to the questionnaire), the latest FU in this second time point was made during the last visit to the CMHI. The predictors of disease recurrence were evaluated by the construction of a logistic regression model and receiver operating characteristics. The average FU after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery (TSS) of 26 patients was 10.23 years (0.67-24.50). Recurrence of CD occurred in four out of 26 patients (15.4%) after an average time of 3.6 years (0.92-8.08) following definitive treatment. The results of the statistical analysis of potential predictive factors for CD recurrence were not conclusive, with no variables confirmed above the statistical significance threshold of p &lt; 0.05. As regards the longer FU, two potential predictors: mean cortisol level at night (p = 0.10) and max. ACTH level after ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (oCRH) test (p = 0.10), were the closest to meeting the assumed threshold of statistical significance. Recurrence of CD may be diagnosed even a long time after its effective treatment. It is possible that cortisol levels at night and ACTH values in oCRH test before TSS may be helpful to predict which patients may experience a recurrence after successful initial treatment. However, further studies on a larger sample are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) as well as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were collected from 540 euthyroid post menopausal women aged 45-65 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to measure visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine whether abdominal fat was associated with thyroid hormones. Weight, BMI, WC, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (Fins), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), TSH, and fT4 were higher in the obese group than in the nonobese group (p &lt; 0.05). The study participants were divided into four groups according to quartiles in the light of TSH reference range (0.1-4.2 mU\/L). Subcutaneous adipose tissue and VAT increased with the TSH levels.

After SGAs treatment, the serum levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), and total thyroxine (TT4) significantly decreased, and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels significantly increased (changes from baseline: FT3: -0.31 pmol\/L, p &lt; 0.001; FT4: -2.71 pmol\/L, p &lt; 0.001; TT3: -0.05 nmol\/L, p = 0.024, TT4: -12.36 nmol\/L, p &lt; 0.001; TSH: 0.46 mIU\/L, p &lt; 0.001). One (1.4%) patient had TSH levels higher than 7 mIU\/L.

SW579 cells were selected and transfected with miR-597-3p mimics. Then the expression of miR-597-3p and RAB23 were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting, respectively. Subsequently, the abilities of proliferation, invasion, and migration of SW579 cells were researched. For further study, the Luciferase reporter assay proved that miR-597-3p could target the expression of RAB23, and the proteins of invasion and migration were also measured to clear the mechanism. After being transfected with miR-597-3p mimics, the expression of miR-597-3p was remarkably increased and RAB23 was significantly decreased. The abilities of proliferation, invasion, and migration also decreased significantly. The miRTarase Database predicated and Luciferase reporter assay proved that RAB23 was the target gene of miR-597-3p. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and N-cadherin was down-regulated, and the expression of E-cadherin was up-regulated. miR-597-3p could reduce the proliferation, invasion and migration abilities of SW579 cells, which may be related to the targeted inhibition of RAB23 expression and down-regulation of the expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and N-cadherin proteins of SW579 cells.

Besides its enzymatic capacity, renalase shows cytoprotective properties by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the renalase gene have been identified, of which the most widely studied in relation to the development of selected diseases are rs2296545, rs10887800, and rs2576178. Numerous publications prove the contribution of renalase to the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, ischaemic stroke, diabetes type 1 and 2, as well as female infertility and schizophrenia.

It is very often a lifethreatening condition requiring not only corticosteroid administration and intubation, which only constitute a short-term symptomatic therapy, but also surgical intervention, including tracheostomy. The most common surgical methods implemented in bilateral vocal fold paralysis include posterior cordectomy, arytenoidectomy, and, more and more commonly, re-innervation. Other techniques used in restoring airway patency include laterofixation, botulinum toxin injection, and laryngeal stimulation, which is still under research.

The mouse double minute 2 homologue (MDM2) is considered as an important oncogene in many tumours, but it has been little studied in pituitary adenomas and the mechanism is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the function of MDM2 and its primary mechanism of action in pituitary adenoma cells. The expression of MDM2 in pituitary adenoma cell lines and normal cells was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The proliferation and apoptosis of pituitary adenoma cells after inhibition of MDM2 expression were detected by MTS and flow cytometry, respectively. The protein expressions of MDM2 and p53 were detected by western blot. Co-IP was used to detect the direct binding between MDM2 and p53. The results of RT-PCR showed that MDM2 was significantly up-regulated in pituitary adenoma cell lines. Inhibition of MDM2 suppressed the proliferation and promoted apoptosis of pituitary adenoma cells. However, inhibiting the expression of MDM2 can promotethe protein expression of p53. The results of co-IP showed that MDM2 interacted with p53 by direct combination. Then, we inhibited the expressions of p53 and MDM2 simultaneously in the pituitary adenoma cells by co-transfecting siRNAs, and the results showed that, compared with the group that inhibited MDM2 alone, cell proliferation of the co-transfected group increased and apoptosis of the cotransfected group decreased, which was similar to the NC group. Taken together, these results suggest that MDM2 promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of pituitary adenoma cells by directly interacting with p53 in pituitary adenoma cells. Therefore, MDM2-p53 may serve as a novel marker and therapeutic target for pituitary adenomas.

Depending on the thyroid hormone level, they were subdivided into two groups: Group 1 - hyperthyroid patients (n = 34) and Group 2 - euthyroid patients (n = 22). The total oxidant status expressed as the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) as well as selected enzymatic and nonenzymatic components of the antioxidant system, including the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and paraoxonase 1 (PON-1), as well as the levels of vitamin C, uric acid, and lipid peroxidation products: malondialdehyde (MDA) and conjugated dienes (CD) were assessed in all enrolled participants. The FRAP values in Group 1 were significantly higher than in controls. The FRAP values in Group 2 were lower than in Group 1 and higher than in controls. However, the differences were not significant. In Group 1, the activity of SOD and GPx, as well as serum levels of uric acid, MDA, and CD, were significantly higher than in controls. At the same time, serum PON-1 activity and vitamin C levels were significantly lower in Group 1 than in controls. In Group 2, the SOD activity as well as MDA and CD levels were non-significantly lower than in Group 1 and non-significantly higher than in controls. The activity of GPx in euthyroid patients with TAO was significantly higher than in controls. Hyperthyroidism is a significant contributor to oxidative stress in patients with active TAO, which manifests as upregulated lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system activation. Euthyroid state restoration leads to a relative reduction in activity and levels of most studied antioxidant parameters, which still remain above the normal values.

Diagnosis and appropriate management allow to reduce the risk of complications in newborns and the perinatal mortality rate and also improve the prognosis for mother and offspring. Metformin is taken by many patients before pregnancy due to both previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes and in the treatment of prediabetes, obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as part of therapy for insulin resistance. The use of metformin in pregnancy has been controversial for many years, particularly in terms of the safety of continuation of drug therapy. Available scientific data indicate both benefits and possible drug-related adverse effects in offspring of metformin-treated patients. This problem is related not only to patients with type 2 diabetes, but also to those with PCOS who are at increased risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery and the diagnosis of GDM in subsequent stages of pregnancy.

In DM, the internal blood-retinal barrier is the earliest to be damaged, and changes in neuroretina result from the loss of its adaptation to metabolic disorders. Patients with DM have a higher incidence of thyroid disease compared to people without DM. The coexistence of DM with thyroid disease leads to endothelial damage, and the degree of its dysfunction has a significant impact on the course of macro- and microangiopathic complications in patients. There are few reports in the literature about the impact of thyroid disease and substitution of levothyroxine preparations on the development and course of DR in patients with DM.

Demographic and surgical factors as well as the biochemical parameters of mineral homeostasis, controlled both preoperatively and postoperatively, were subject to statistical analysis. In line with contemporary guidelines, postoperative hypocalcaemia, rather than an abnormally low serum parathormone (PTH) concentration, was considered a diagnostic criterion of HypoPT. On postoperative day one (POD1), serum concentration of PTH decreased below the normal range (&lt; 12 pg\/mL) in 29 patients and was undetectable in 19 patients (&lt; 6 pg\/mL). At one year postoperatively, 12 patients with undetectable POD1 PTH required treatment for hypocalcaemia and were diagnosed with permanent hypoPT. All the other patients regained normocalcaemia. Relative risk of permanent HypoPT associated with undetectable POD1 PTH was 88.75. A significant difference in median POD1 serum calcium concentration between the patients with undetectable POD1 PTH and those with detectable POD1 PTH was found (p &lt; 0.001). The difference between the POD1 serum calcium in patients with permanent or transient HypoPT in the subgroup with undetectable POD1 PTH did not reach the level of statistical significance (median, 1.82 mmol\/L vs. 1.96 mmol\/L).

Women, when compared with men, displayed a significantly higher mean level of anxiety and insomnia (7.3 vs. 4.6 scores) and somatic symptoms (7.4 vs. 5.5), and worse general mental health status (25.6 vs. 18.8). The most disturbing symptoms were observed among patients with complete and partial AIS, and complete GD (general mental health status: 39.5, 24.3, and 24.2, respectively), women lacking a vagina (27.2), and without an enlarged clitoris (27.5). Patients after genital surgery had significantly fewer somatic symptoms (5.4 vs. 7.8; p &lt; 0.05) and better general mental health status in comparison to those without surgery (20.1 vs. 24.9; p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were observed between patients using hormone replacement therapy and those who were not. The individuals with DSD and Y chromosome in the karyotype have increased risk of developing mental problems in comparison to the general Polish population. The risk factors seem to be as follows: female gender, the lack of a vagina, the lack of virilisation (no enlarged clitoris), and no genital operations performed. In some cases, sex hormone replacement therapy may be also the risk of mental problems. Particularly vulnerable groups are CAIS, PAIS, and CGD. The psychological support and an individual approach to particular needs of these patients is necessary.

For many years thyroid diseases have been suspected as the cause of vertigo by ENT physicians. Almost every patient hospitalised due to severe vertigo is investigated for thyroid disease as a suspected cause of acute vestibulopathy. The issue presented in this paper is related to a difficult and poorly understood relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and peripheral vertigo.","220":"Diabetes mellitus is one the most frequent co-morbid conditions in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), frequently leading to chronic kidney failure. Progression of CKD accelerates several metabolic disorders, predominantly those related to abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism. Patients with CKD are usually characterised by an insulin resistance additionally aggravated by several co-morbid conditions (for example chronic low-grade inflammation). Treatment with anti-diabetic medications in patients with CKD remains a challenge because, along with the disease progression, the dosing of several drugs needs to be adjusted to the reduced kidney function (especially those that are excreted intact with urine or as active metabolites). Progression of CKD also increases the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with anti-diabetic drugs, and other adverse drug reactions may occur more frequently. Usefulness of the new generation drugs has not yet been verified in patients with advanced kidney disease (although some of them act through kidney-related mechanisms). The current position statement of the Polish Society of Nephrology Working Group provides practical recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with CKD and reduced kidney function.","221":"Not required for Clinical Vignette.","222":"Not required for Clinical Vignette.","223":"Thyroid dysgenesis (TD) is the main cause of congenital hypothyroidism (CH), affecting nearly 1 in 2000-3000 newborns worldwide, as the most common neonatal endocrine disorder. Paired box gene 8 (PAX8), expressed during all stages of thyroid follicular cell, plays a key role in thyroid morphogenesis by a complex regulatory network. In conclusion, the genetic mechanism of PAX8 mutant in TD is still ambiguous; therefore, further research is needed. Blood samples were collected from 289 TD patients in Shandong Province, China. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. All the exons of PAX8 along with their exon-intro boundaries were amplified by PCR and analysed by Sanger sequencing. We identified three novel PAX8 nonsense mutations in three patients by sequence analysis of PAX8: Patient 1 (c.285C&gt;G, p.Tyr95Ter), Patient 2 (c.747T&gt;G, p.Tyr249Ter), and Patient 3 (c.786C&gt;A, p.Tyr262Ter). All the three patients carrying PAX8 variants had obvious clinical phenotypes of thyroid anomaly, such as hypoplasia and athyreosis. We conducted the largest worldwide PAX8 mutation screening so far in TD patients. Three presumably pathogenic PAX8 mutations were detected in 289 TD cases for the first time, showing the mutation rate of PAX8 is 1.04% in Chinese TD patients. In addition, our study expands the gene mutation spectrum of TD.

A total of 225 patients hospitalised in the Endocrinology Department and General Department from May 2017 to May 2018 were enrolled and categorised into five groups: the pure T2DM group (group A, 45 patients), the bone mass reduction group (group B, 45 patients), the T2DM + bone mass reduction group (group C, 45 patients), the OP group (group D, 45 patients), and the T2DM + OP group (group E, 45 patients); meanwhile, age-matched healthy subjects undergoing physical examination in our hospital were collected as the normal control group (group NC, 45 cases). Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the influencing factors of bone mass in patients with T2DM. Compared with group B, the expression levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), 25(OH)D, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FINS), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and BSP mRNA were significantly increased while OPG and b-collagen degradation products (b-CTX) were significantly decreased in group A. The expression of BSP mRNA and the decrease of 25(OH)D and OPG in peripheral blood may participate in the development of diabetes and osteoporosis. ","226":null,"227":null,"228":"Higher cortisol levels are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly, partially resulting from biologic effects of glucocorticoids (GCs) on endothelial cells observed in an experimental setting. These features are replicated in patients with endogenous GC excess (Cushing's syndrome) or with exogenous hypercortisolism due to excessive pharmacological application of GCs. Both groups present also an increased cardiovascular disease event rate. GCs may also adversely influence recovery after myocardial infarction. Recently it was proposed that microRNAs (miRNAs) - small noncoding RNAs functioning as antisense regulators of gene expression by targeting mRNA - may have a central role in regulating endothelial function through multiple mechanisms. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic GC excess on the expression of selected endothelium-controlling miRNAs expressed in nucleated cells circulating in peripheral blood (PBNCs) of patients with endogenous hypercortisolism either due to corticotrophin-independent or corticotrophin-dependent Cushing's syndrome (CS). Peripheral blood nuclear cells were collected from 35 healthy subjects and 31 patients with endogenous hypercortisolism as a source of miRNAs. A self-validated individual quantitative RT-PCR study was then performed to evaluate the expression levels of selected miRNAs in PBNCs. Additionally, endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in peripheral blood was assessed with respect to endothelial dysfunction using Western blotting. The ET-1 expression levels in CS were higher than in controls, confirming endothelial dysfunction in the CS group. Furthermore, miRNA analysis revealed a significantly decreased intracellular expression of selected endothelium-related miRNAs in patients with endogenous hypercortisolism, including miRNA-17-5p, miRNA-126-3p, and miRNA-126-5p, compared to controls. In contrast, two other angiogenic miRNAs, miRNA-150-5p and miRNA-223-3p, were significantly upregulated compared to controls. Cardiovascular events related to hypercortisolism remain a challenging problem in medical practice. This study has demonstrated that the chronic excess of GCs in endogenous CS might induce significant dysregulation of selected miRNAs involved in the control of endothelium biology. However, the lack of knowledge about specific miRNA expression postpones the full understanding of the biological roles of such miRNAs in hypercortisolism. Moreover, dysregulated miRNAs seem to be promising targets for further research, especially to search for potential therapies for several GC-induced cardiovascular complications.

The aim of this study was to assess the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs741301) of the ELMO1 gene with DKD in Polish patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This was a case\/control study of 272 T2DM patients with or without DKD. Patients were divided into groups depending on DKD definition according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF). The association of the rs741301 polymorphism with DKD was assessed in the whole study group as well as in the subgroups stratified according to the presence of DKD. There was no association between rs741301 polymorphisms and the presence of DKD in relation to the ADA definition (p = 0.6) or the NKF definition (p = 0.5) of DKD and with estimated glomelural filtration rate (eGFR) value reflecting the stage of the chronic kidney disease (p = 0.8).

","232":"Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of increased morbidity and mortality in developed and developing countries. One of the most important risk factors responsible for atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular diseases is hyperlipidaemia. Currently, hyperlipidaemias are divided into several clinical entities. The greatest risk is associated with hypercholesterolaemia. As a result, modern guidelines for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis focus predominantly on the reduction of LDL-cholesterol. Hypertriglyceridaemia and atherogenic dyslipidaemia, which are responsible for a less significant increase in the cardiovascular risk, are nowadays secondary targets of the treatment. During the work-up for hyperlipidaemia one of the essential actions is the exclusion of secondary causes of the lipid abnormalities. Those include, among others, endocrine diseases, diabetes, drugs, nephrotic syndrome, and pregnancy. Data regarding the impact of endocrine disease and diabetes on the lipid profile are scattered. In this review, the authors aimed to perform a thorough analysis of the available publications regarding the topic and the preparation of a comprehensive review dealing with the incidence, clinical features, and the therapy of hyperlipidaemias in patients with endocrine disease.","233":"Adipose tissue is also a secretory organ producing active substances called adipokines. Some of them (apelin, resistin, adiponectin, leptin, chemerin, or visfatin) may play a role in the pathogenesis and course of respiratory diseases, e.g. COPD, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, or lung cancer. There are limited and conflicting data on the role of adipokines in asthma. It has been confirmed, however, that visfatin and leptin can be markers of inflammation in COPD. Elevated concentrations of leptin and resistin play a pro-inflammatory role in the development of cancer cachexia. The role of adipokines has also been demonstrated in pulmonary hypertension, and the apelinadiponectin axis disruption may exacerbate pulmonary hypertension.","234":"Phosphate plays a critical role in many vital cellular processes. Deviations from normal serum phosphate levels, including alterations in the extracellular phosphate\/pyrophosphate ratio, can cause severe consequences, such as ectopic calcification. Cellular phosphate levels are tightly controlled by sodium phosphate cotransporters, underscoring their importance in cellular physiology. The role of sodium phosphate cotransporters in ectopic calcification requires further elucidation, taking into account their important role in the control of intracellular phosphate levels and the synthesis of ATP, the main source of extracellular pyrophosphate (a potent endogenous inhibitor of calcification). In this review, we discuss the roles of phosphate and pyrophosphate homeostasis in ectopic calcification, with a specific focus on phosphate transporters. We concentrate on the five known sodium-dependent phosphate transporters and review their localisation and regulation by external factors, and the effects observed in knockout studies and in naturally occurring mutations.","235":"","236":null,"237":null,"238":"","239":"Not required for Clinical Vignette.","240":"We investigated the impact of long-term levothyroxine (LT4) treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers (BTMs) in premenopausal women with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) after thyroidectomy.

We measured the Z-scores of lumbar and hip BMD, serum free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), N-terminal propeptide of type 1 N procollagen (P1NP), C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-1), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), vitamin D3, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in all participants. In DTC subjects, serum TSH levels were lower, and serum FT4, P1NP, CTX-1, and ALP levels were higher compared with controls. The prevalence of low BMD was higher in DTC subjects than in controls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that serum TSH levels were negatively associated with CTX-1 and ALP. We found a high prevalence of low BMD among premenopausal women who received long-term LT4 therapy for DTC after thyroidectomy.

We enrolled 116 patients who were diagnosed with PA and then underwent AVS in the West China Hospital of Sichuan University from April 2015 to April 2017. The AI, calculated by dividing the aldosterone concentration of the failed side by the aldosterone concentration of IVC, was used for lateralisation diagnosis if the cannulation was judged to be failed by traditional method. Patients with dominant adrenal gland based on successful AVS were included in subgroup 2 (n = 75), while the patients diagnosed with a dominant gland using AI method were enrolled in subgroup 1 (n = 41). No significant difference of clinical and biochemical findings between the two groups was detected (p value after operation &gt; 0.05). ROC analysis was performed to test the specificity and sensitivity based on the AI in subgroup 2. The AUC for dominant gland detection was 0.76, which resulted in 91.3% sensitivity and 67.53% specificity. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2.81.

Such markers are difficult to uncover by linkage analysis but can be revealed by association studies. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered 31 SNPs associated with DTC. These markers carry a low to moderate risk for DTC, but their cumulative effect increases with each successive risk allele. These data support the important contribution of low penetrance variants in the pathogenesis of DTC. Contrary to somatic mutations such as BRAFV600E, germline variants can be ascertained prior to surgical treatment. Therefore, we hypothesise that GWAS SNPs might impact the clinical course of DTC and we can benefit from this knowledge in choosing a treatment strategy. Several associations between clinical factors and GWAS markers have been reported so far. The most important are associations between rs966423 and mortality (HR = 1.60, p = 0.038), extrathyroidal extension (ETE) (OR = 1.57, p = 0.019); rs965513 and tumour diameter (slope of regression 0.14, p = 0.025), lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.59, p = 0.030) and ETE (OR = 1.29, p = 0.045); rs944289 and distant metastasis (OR = 0.58, p = 0.042); and rs116909374 and lymph node metastasis (OR = 0.61, p = 0.016). These findings show that GWAS SNPs are not only the ignition factors (together with environmental factors) for malignant transformation of thyrocytes but might also impact the clinical course of DTC. Surprisingly, it is not always the risk allele for DTC that is associated with worse clinical outcome. The second interesting observation is that GWAS SNPs show different associations with DTC clinical features depending on their histological subtypes. These point to the complexity of DTC with putatively different roles of genes at different stages of DTC development.

However, inconsistent changes in the patient's symptoms and brain MRI findings may occur during the clinical course of the disease. This review was performed to summarise the relationship between symptoms and brain MRI findings in previously reported cases of neurosarcoidosis with CDI. Case studies of patients diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis with CDI were collected via a PubMed search of studies published through 30 June 2018. Thirteen eligible studies were reviewed (20 patients; 12 men, 8 women; mean age 33 years). Polydipsia or polyuria was the first symptom in 13 patients. The mean duration from disease onset to diagnosis was 3.4 months. Brain MRIs showed abnormal findings in the hypothalamus and pituitary for 17 patients. Immunosuppressive drugs were used in 17 patients. For 14 patients, MRI findings improved, while symptoms did not.

However, their receptors have been identified also in several organs and tissues beyond the reproductive system, and there is cumulating evidence of their direct extra-gonadal actions. The expression of LH receptors (LHR) was found in the brain and adrenal cortex. FSH receptors (FSHR) were found to be expressed in osteoclasts, monocytes, adipocytes, and peri- and intra-tumoural blood vessel endothelia of malignant tumours. Other localisations of FSHR and LHR are also suggested by immunohistochemistry, but these findings need confirmation using molecular biology techniques. Because the high levels of gonadotropins are a constant phenomenon during human aging, especially in postmenopausal women, it is hypothesised that the direct actions of FSH and LH are involved in the pathogenesis of age-related disorders.

The study involved 80 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis divided into groups: I with BMI of 30.0 34.9, obese; and II with BMI of 18-24.9, normoweight. Leptin, adiponectin and resistin concentrations were assessed, and bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in the L1-L4 section of the spine using the DXA densitometric method. The results of the comparison of the two groups indicate a statistically significant dependence in groups regarding leptin secretion; the group of obese women demonstrated significantly higher concentrations. No differences between the groups were demonstrated for adiponectin or resistin secretion. Higher leptin concentration and a positive correlation with BMI was confirmed in obese postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. It was also demonstrated that BMD increases with growing BMI. No effect of obesity on the secretion of adiponectin or resistin in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis was found.

In the authors' opinion this site excludes laparoscopic tumourectomy. Twenty-eight patients were selected for surgical management of abdominal paragangliomas in the past eight years at our endocrine surgical centre. This group consisted of 21 (75%) women and seven (25%) men, aged 14 to 84 years (mean 47.9). In 13 (46.4%) cases paroxysmal hypertension was observed. Type 2 diabetes was noted in another 10 (35.7%) patients, and Takotsubo acute coronary syndrome in two (7.1%). Patients were preoperatively qualified for either open surgery or laparoscopic tumourectomy based on visualisation and location of the tumours in imaging studies. All patients were successfully operated. Eleven (39.3%) patients qualified for laparoscopy, while the remaining 17 (60.7%) were treated with an open surgical approach due to difficult access to the lesion. The mean operative time was 130 minutes for laparoscopy and 120 minutes for laparotomy (p = 0.2). There were no local or general complications after either type of procedure.

All patients underwent pathological tests to be classified into one of two groups: PTL group and HT group. The cut-off value of CT density was determined using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of diagnosis for thyroid by CT alone, ultrasound alone, and the combination of CT plus ultrasound were calculated.

In this paper authors present a case of a patient with a diet-induced obesity, whose only abnormalities in thyroid assessment included an elevated level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and hypoechoic thyroid gland on ultrasound. Based on this clinical situation, we reviewed literature in order to establish rules regarding management of thyroid disorders in obese individuals. The most common obesity-related thyroid abnormality is an isolated increase of TSH, without clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism, defined as hyperthyrotropinaemia. In obese adults, autoimmune thyroid disease is found equally often as in the normal-weight population. Thyroid enlargement, increased risk of nodules, and decreased echogenicity, not related to autoimmunity, is frequent among obese individuals. Weight loss leads to the normalisation of TSH levels and thyroid echogenicity. Excessive weight can influence both the TSH level and ultrasound image of the thyroid gland; however, these findings can be reversed by weight reduction. Therefore, in asymptomatic obese patients elevated TSH should not be treated with thyroid hormone replacement.","262":"Hypophysitis is a broad term used to describe conditions leading to inflammation of the pituitary gland and the pituitary stalk. It may develop as a primary condition or secondary to other diseases. Hypophysitis is classified based on aetiological, anatomical, and histological criteria. Clinical symptoms result from enlargement of the pituitary gland, hormonal deficiencies, diabetes insipidus, and hyperprolactinemia. Histopathological verification of tissue samples from a pituitary biopsy remains the gold standard in diagnosing hypophysitis. However, due to the invasiveness and risk of the procedure it is rarely performed. The diagnosis is based mainly on clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and imaging. The rarity of the disease and the deficit in reliable data result in a lack of clear guidelines in the treatment of hypophysitis. The basic therapy relies on hormonal replacement. High doses of steroids are the first-line treatment of symptoms caused by mass effect in sella and compression of surrounding structures. In steroid-resistant patients or in cases of inacceptable sides effects, treatment with other immunosuppressant drugs was administered with success. The course of the disease varies: some patients present remission, in other cases hypophysitis leads to fibrosis and atrophy of the pituitary gland, which is reflected in persistent hormonal deficiencies and images of an empty sella. The objective of this article is to present the most important information: the epidemiology, clinical image, diagnostic procedures, and treatment of primary hypophysitis, in order to allow better understanding of this disease and implementation of proper management.

The thyroid dysfunction may present with various forms: from subclinical changes in hormone levels to amiodaroneinduced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) and amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH). We reported six patients in the age range from two weeks to 14 years, with complex congenital cardiac diseases and severe arrhythmias, who developed amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunctions: thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism or both together. The clinical signs and symptoms of all thyroid dysfunctions were atypical, most patients presented with an aggravation of heart insufficiency. Our patients with thyrotoxicosis were treated with combined therapy including thionamides and corticosteroids due to the presentation of mixed-identified type of AIT. Currently, five patients (one patient's status is unknown) are in biochemical and clinical euthyreosis; however, in one of them it was impossible to discharge amiodarone treatment. Three of them are still treated with levothyroxine, and two do not need thyroid treatment. Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction is usually atypical; therefore, monitoring of thyroid status before, during, and after amiodarone is demanded.

We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and genetic data of patients diagnosed with MEN1 syndrome and followed-up in two polish referral centres in the years 1994-2018. We analysed 79 patients, of whom the majority were women. The mean age of the patient population was 43 years, mean age at MEN1 diagnosis was 37.95 years, and mean interval from initial symptoms to MEN1 diagnosis was 6.93 years. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP), gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (GEP-NET), and pituitary adenoma (PA) developed in 90%, 52%, and 47% of patients, respectively. The dominance of insulinoma with low prevalence of gastrinoma is the most vivid difference, when compared to previously described populations. Moreover, we found 3.5-fold higher risk of developing a pituitary tumour in patients with a frameshift mutation with the STOP codon of the MEN1 gene. The Polish population of patients with MEN1 is different than previously described European and Asian populations, primarily in prevalence of functional NETs.

BRAFV600E mutation was analysed by DNA sequencing method in tumour specimens. We hypothesised thatBRAFV600E mutation prevalence is positively correlated with prolonged iodine exposure and expected to be higher in the second half of the recruitment period due to the increment in time spent from the iodisation process of the table salt in our country. Thus, iodine exposure was categorised as short-term (2000-2006) and long-term (2006-2012). A total of 197 patients were accrued. The study population predominantly consisted of conventional variant. A statistically significant relationship was observed betweenBRAFV600E mutation presence and age (p = 0.03), conventional variant PTC (p = 0.00002), T4 stage (p = 0.002), vascular invasion (p = 0.036), thyroid capsule invasion (p &lt; 0.00001), extrathyroidal tissue invasion (p &lt; 0.00001), and lymph node metastasis (p &lt; 0.00001). When categorised as long-term and short-term, iodine exposure was not statistically significantly related withBRAFV600E mutation; however, there were far more PTC cases in the long-term group (86.3% vs. 13.7%). We revealed that BRAFV600E mutation is associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters. There appeared to be no relation between long-term iodine exposure and BRAFV600E. ","269":"The aim of this study was to compare plasma oxytocin levels in obese women of childbearing age with non-obese women of childbearing age, and to investigate the relationship between plasma oxytocin levels and metabolic parameters (including blood glucose, insulin resistance, blood lipid, and blood pressure). A total of 151 obese women of childbearing age and 160 non-obese women of childbearing age were enrolled in this study. Plasma oxytocin levels were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FI), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured in all subjects. Quantile regression analysis was used to analyse the associations of plasma oxytocin levels with FBG, FI, HOMA-IR, TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, SBP, and DBP. In obese women of childbearing age, plasma oxytocin levels were lower compared with non-obese controls. After adjusting for age, quantile regression analysis showed that the plasma oxytocin levels were inversely associated with HOMA-IR at the quantile level between 0.27 and 0.79 (i.e. the HOMA-IR level of 2.11 and 3.07, respectively), the plasma oxytocin levels were inversely associated with TC after the quantile level of 0.21 (i.e. the TC level of 3.78 ), and the plasma oxytocin levels were inversely associated with LDL-C at all quantile levels of LDL-C. In addition, the plasma oxytocin levels showed a positive association with HDL-C at all quantile levels of HDL-C. No significant associations were found between the plasma oxytocin levels and FBG, FI, TG, SBP, and DBP. Oxytocin deficiency was common in obese women of childbearing age. Oxytocin showed negative correlation with HOMA-IR, TC, and LDL-C, while it showed positive association with HDL-C. Our findings suggest that oxytocin played an important role in inhibiting metabolic disorders associated with obesity in women of childbearing age. ","270":"Neuroendocrine neoplasms are tumours that usually arise in the gastrointestinal tract and the bronchopulmonary system. The orbit is a rare anatomical site for their metastases. In the following article we present a case report of a 73-year-old man who was admitted to the Ophthalmology Department because of eye pain and high intraocular pressure in the right eye. There was also eye motility restriction, diplopia, oedema of the eyelid, and subconjunctival haemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumour in the right orbit, probably arising from the inferior rectus muscle. The patient was qualified for surgery, during which orbit decompression was conducted and a sample of the tumour tissue was collected. Based on the biopsy of the lesion, diagnosis of a metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, probably of gastrointestinal origin, was made. Further diagnostic procedures revealed metastases to other organs, and the patient was qualified for oncological treatment. In this case, orbital metastasis was the first diagnosed location of the neoplasm.","271":"Not required for Clinical Vignette.","272":null,"273":null,"274":"Women with PCOS are characterised by ovarian hyperandrogenism, which, apart from fertility problems, hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia, also leads to the development of central (android) obesity and its adverse metabolic consequences. Additionally, women with PCOS have intrinsic insulin resistance (IR) with its consequent hyperinsulinaemia, which leads to the development of atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which give rise to cardiovascular disease (CVD), being the main cause of death among women. Although there are several publications on the topic of life-style changes in women with PCOS to normalise body weight and thus to reduce the adverse metabolic consequences of obesity, such as T2DM and CVD, the number of randomised studies that would enable the formation of strong recommendations is very limited. Nevertheless, taking into consideration the pathophysiology, any intervention implementing healthy dietary habits leading to the reduction of body weigh should be the core of non-pharmacological treatment in women with PCOS. The aim of the given recommendations herein is to point out and systemise the interventions on lifestyle change in women with PCOS as well as to form a practical guideline for the health care specialists, dieticians, and mental-therapists (psychologist) who take care of women with this syndrome.","275":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. The prevalence of colorectal neoplasm is increasing. Many studies have shown that thyroid dysfunction may be connected with the higher risk of pancreatic and breast cancer, but only a few described the role of thyroid dysfunction and thyroid hormone (TH) replacement in the development and risk of CRC. The aim of this study is to summarise all findings and potentially elucidate the connection between TH imbalance and colorectal cancer. The systematic review was conducted according to PICO and PRISMA guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu, and Cochrane Library databases using the following keywords: \"((((thyroid OR hypothyroidism OR hyperthyroidism OR levothyroxine OR hashimoto OR graves OR thyroidectomy)) AND (colon OR colorectal OR CRC)) NOT hashimoto[Author]) NOT graves[Author])\". No filters were used. Of total of 3054 articles identified by the search strategy, 11 met PICO criteria and were included into the review. Four of those were on cell lines and seven were human studies. Analysis of the included studies revealed an elevated risk of CRC in patients with hypothyroidism with aORs ranging from 1.16 (95% CI: 1.08-1.24, p &lt; 0.001) to 1.69 (95% CI: 1.21-2.36, p = 0.002). Moreover, TH replacement therapy has a protective effect for CRC risk with aOR ranging from 0.60 (95% CI: 0.44-0.81, p = 0.001) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86-0.98, p = 0.009). THs seem to play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Further studies are warranted to define the exact role of thyroid hormone imbalance in prevention and treatment of CRC.","276":null,"277":"The aim of this study was to explore the potential role of IL-35 in Graves' disease (GD). A total of 142 GD patients including 80 newly onset patients, 52 refractory patients and 10 remission patients and 70 normal controls (NCs) were recruited. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of P35 and Epstein-Barr-virus-induced gene 3 (Ebi3) were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Serum level of IL-35 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of IL-35mRNA in new onset GD and refractory GD were both significantly higher than NC. Comparison between remission GD and NC showed no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05). A significant increase of Ebi3mRNA expression was observed in new onset GD compared with remission GD (p = 0.030). The new onset GD showed a tendency for increased expression of serum IL-35 but without significant difference. No correlation between IL-35 expression and clinic parameters was found. Our preliminary observations indicate that IL-35 and CD4+P35+Ebi3+T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of GD. ","278":"Approximately 70% of medical decisions are made based on results of laboratory investigations. Immunochemical methods are used most commonly in routine laboratory diagnostics of endocrine disorders. Those methods are limited by susceptibility of the immunochemical reaction to various interferences. Interference may be caused by the presence of autologous antibodies, heterophilic antibodies, or paraproteins in the blood serum, by cross-reactions with similar reagents, haemolysis, significant lipidaemia, or hyperbilirubinaemia. Some recent reports have indicated a significant effect of biotin on the reliability of laboratory investigations. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin belonging to the B group. It is present in popular dietary supplements - alone or as a component of multi-vitamin formulas - and it is advertised as a remedy to falling out and fragility of hair and nails. Due to its low molecular weight and a strong affinity to streptavidin, biotin is used in many immunochemical tests. Due to a strong and stable bond of streptavidin and biotin, analytical methods using the streptavidin (avidin)-biotin system are characterised by superior sensitivity, and they allow determination of very low levels of the tested substance in biological material. The presence of exogenous biotin in a sample may cause interference when using tests that utilise the streptavidin (avidin)-biotin system. Interference of biotin with immunochemical tests depends on several factors: the construction of the immunochemical test, the dose used by the patient, the biotin concentration in the sample, and most of all - the time from the last dose to the collection of biological material for laboratory testing. In this paper we present some practical recommendations and a procedure to be followed in the case of suspected interference of biotin in immunochemical assays, for clinicians and laboratory diagnosticians.","279":null,"280":"Granulin (GRN) is an adipokine with proinflammatory features, which plays important role in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance pathogenesis. It has been reported that granulin precursors were localised in developing follicles in animal studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of granulin levels with anthropometric features, glucose metabolism, and ovarian reserve. A total of 109 infertile women were included in this cross-sectional, prospective study, who attended a tertiary clinic. All participants were categorised into diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and normal ovarian reserve groups (NOR), in accordance with Bologna criteria. The demographic characteristics, including age, BMI, waist-hip circumferences, and biochemical parameters, were recorded. Serum granulin level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. No significant difference was observed in the GRN levels (p = 0.229) between the groups. There was a positive correlation between GRN levels and BMI, WC, HC, and 75 g oral glucose tolerance values in NOR group (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Our results suggest that granulin is associated with anthropometric features in infertile patients and might be an important indicator of obesity and impaired glucose metabolism. Elevated levels of granulin may have a diabetogenic effect and predispose women to high glucose levels. ","281":"The noninvasive encapsulated, follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma was reclassified as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). The exclusion of NIFTP from the group of malignant tumours decreases the risk of malignancy (RoM) as defined by the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the RoM for each category in TBSRTC with and without exclusion of NIFTP from the tally of malignancies. The present study included 998 thyroid nodules cases. All patients underwent diagnostic tests, including fine-needle aspiration cytology, and received surgical treatment. Slides for all resection specimens with a diagnosis of cancer were reviewed to identify NIFTP. The RoM for each of the categories in TBSRTC with and without exclusion of NIFTP from the malignant tumours was evaluated. The RoM decreased with the exclusion of NIFTP from malignant categorisation with the following values for the different TBSRTC categories: non-diagnostic (ND): 0%; benign: 0%; atypia\/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS\/FLUS): 1.6%; follicular neoplasm\/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN\/SFN): 0.7%; suspicious for malignancy (SUS): 6.9%; and malignant: 2.5%. The difference of 2.5% in the malignant category was statistically significant (p = 0.0253). The RoM for specific TBSRTC categories needs to be defined for each treatment centre because it is important for the selection of the appropriate surgical treatment for thyroid tumours. ","282":null,"283":"The predominance of high-molecular-weight forms of prolactin in plasma is referred to as macroprolactinaemia. Unlike monomeric hyperprolactinaemia, no previous study has investigated cardiometabolic risk factors in subjects with elevated macroprolactin content. We studied two age-, weight-, and blood pressure-matched groups of premenopausal women: 11 women with macroprolactinaemia and 11 women with prolactin levels within the reference range. The outcomes of interest included: glucose homeostasis markers, plasma lipids, as well as plasma levels of uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen, homocysteine, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Circulating levels of hsCRP and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose, as well as the homeostatic model assessment 1 of insulin resistance ratio, were higher, while levels of HDL cholesterol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were lower in women with macroprolactinaemia than in women without elevated levels of prolactin. In women with elevated levels of big-big prolactin, values of hsCRP and 25-hydroxyvitamin D correlated with the degree of insulin resistance and, similarly to HDL cholesterol and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose, with macroprolactin content. There were no differences between the study groups in concentrations of fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, fibrinogen, and homocysteine. The obtained results indicate that young women with macroprolactinaemia seem to be characterised by slightly increased cardiometabolic risk. ","284":"Many retrospective studies have confirmed that capecitabine combined with temozolomide is effective in neuroendocrine neoplasms. Most of the studies focused on grade 1 and grade 2 neuroendocrine tumours, mainly of pancreatic origin. There are limited data regarding the efficacy capecitabine with temozolomide in grade 3 neuroendocrine tumours. The new World Health Organisation 2017 classification distinguished well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumours from poorly differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinomas. Treatment options for grade 3 neuroendocrine neoplasms are limited, and the overall prognosis is better in the subgroup of patients with grade 3 neuroendocrine tumours. It was a retrospective study in the population of patients with diagnosed grade 3 neuroendocrine neoplasms of different origin treated with capecitabine and temozolomide. Data on clinical and demographic characteristics of the population were collected from four Polish clinical centres. This study aimed to evaluate response and survival parameters and compare outcomes of treatment of neuroendocrine tumours and carcinomas. The study included 32 patients with grade 3 neuroendocrine tumours treated with capecitabine and temozolomide. The disease control rate was twice as high in the group of patient with neuroendocrine tumours in comparison to carcinomas (70 vs. 30%). The progression-free survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumours was 15.3 months (95% CI: 3.9-30.4), and for patients with neuroendocrine carcinomas it was 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.5-7.1). Median overall survival was 22 months (95% CI: 11.8-22.0) and 4.6 months (95% CI: 2.2-5.9) for patients with tumours and carcinomas, respectively. The treatment regimen was generally well tolerated. The combination of capecitabine and temozolomide is an effective treatment for patients with grade 3 neuroendocrine tumours with Ki-67 index ranging between 20 and 54%. The treatment did not overcome the aggressive character of neuroendocrine carcinomas and resulted in low response and survival outcomes in comparison to those achieved in tumour therapy. ","285":"Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by excessive production of growth hormone (GH), typically by a pituitary tumour. The diagnosis is usually delayed, and patients frequently develop various complications that cause premature mortality. In patients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, and arthropathies that are not age-specific, attention should be paid to signs of acromegaly. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) assay should be used as a screening test whenever acromegaly is suspected. Further diagnostic investigations and treatment should be carried out at specialist centres. First-line treatment involves selective excision of pituitary adenoma using transsphenoidal access. Patients with chances of cure with surgical removal of the pituitary tumour should be referred to centres that have experience in this type of procedure, following pharmacological preparation. Other patients, as well as patients after failed neurosurgical treatment, should first receive chronic treatment with first-generation somatostatin analogues. For second-line treatment, pasireotide, pegvisomant, cabergoline, or combinations thereof should be considered. In every case, acromegaly sequelae require life-long monitoring and active treatment. Current recommendations, being an updated version of the recommendations published in Endokrynologia Polska in 2014, which take into account the Polish situation, should prove useful in the management of patients with acromegaly.","286":"Acromegaly is a rare, chronic condition caused by growth hormone (GH) overproduction, usually due to a benign tumour of the pituitary gland. During the disease many complications occur, including cardiovascular disease and changes in the musculoskeletal, respiratory, and endocrine systems. Treatment includes surgery, medical therapy, and radiation. In this paper a literature review was conducted for information related to costs of management of acromegaly and its associated comorbidities using PubMed.The majority of total costs represent pharmacological treatment, especially the most common somatostatin analogues (SSA) therapy. The average reported annual cost of SSA therapy is EUR 12,000-40,000. Surgery reduces the cost of care via the possibility of avoiding lifelong pharmacological treatment. Radiotherapy is also suggested to lower the costs of therapy because about 60% of patients eventually will not require further pharmacological treatment; however, it is connected with negative outcomes like hypopituitarism, lower quality of life, and increased mortality. Cabergoline and pegvisomant are the lowest and highest priced treatments, respectively, but the overall impact on the cost of therapy is minor due to less frequent usage of these drugs. It is hard to fully estimate the impact of comorbidities of acromegaly on financial burden because patients are treated for them many years before the diagnosis of the underlying pathology. The treatment cost of comorbidities is higher in uncontrolled patients. Life-long treatment of acromegaly and its comorbidities is very expensive. Early diagnosis and successful treatment reduce direct and indirect costs.","287":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a typical membrane receptor with 7-transmembrane helix domain (7TMR), coupled to the G protein. The mature receptor, present in the cell membrane, is composed of the A subunit comprising a large extracellular domain, and the B subunit, which consists of a short extracellular fragment anchored in the cell membrane and an intracellular part. The TSH receptor is subject to numerous post-translational modifications that determine its final structure and significantly affect its activity. One of them is glycosylation. TSHR is abundantly N-glycosylated, due to the presence of six N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain (Asn77, Asn99, Asn113, Asn177, Asn198, Asn302), mostly evolutionarily conserved. N-glycans constitute 30-40% of the receptor molecular weight. The glycans are necessary for the receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane and binding of TSH to the receptor. Fucosylated and sialylated N-oligosaccharides were found on TSHR molecules. The increased sialylation of TSHR glycans correlates positively with the receptor binding ability and prolongs the time of receptor incorporation into the cell membrane. TSHR is the main autoantigen in Graves' disease (GD), one of the thyroid autoimmune diseases. One hypothesis assumes that the higher N-glycosylation of THSR in human compared to animals influences the breaking of autotolerance and GD development. N-oligosaccharides are the important part of THSR molecule, necessary for the proper functioning of receptors and probably involved in thyroid autoimmunity in GD.","288":"papillary thyroid microcarcinoma is a well-known malignant neoplasm with good prognosis. The known prognostic factors are patient's age, multifocality, and extrathyroidal extension. CD9 and CD82, members of the tetraspanin family, are expressed in numerous cancer cells and play many roles associated with the cellular process. we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of CD9 and CD82 in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma and analysed the clinicopathological and prognostic significance. For the retrospective analysis, we collected the cases of 553 PTMC patients who had undergone thyroidectomy. The group with lymph node metastasis showed higher immunostaining intensity for CD9 than the group without metastasis (p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, high CD9 intensity (OR = 1.58 in 3+, p = 0.0025) correlated with lymph node metastasis. We suggest CD9 as a predictive prognostic factor for lymph node metastasis in PTMC. ","289":"Acromegaly is associated with increased growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) secretion which may support tumour development and growth. A 68-year-old woman was diagnosed with acromegaly due to typical clinical and hormonal characteristics. While contrast-enhanced MRI at diagnosis did not reveal a pituitary adenoma, a 5-mm lesion was identified on repeat scanning 13 months later. Abdominal and chest CT showed tumours of the stomach, right adrenal gland, and right lung. The CT also showed a hypodense lesion in the liver and heterogeneous echostructure of the thyroid gland with left lobe solid-cystic tumour. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy revealed increased tracer accumulation in the right thyroid lobe. No tracer accumulation was noted at the location of the other tumours. The resected stomach, adrenal, chest, and thyroid lesions did not show GH secretion. The patient refused pituitary surgery, and her acromegaly is currently well-controlled with somatostatin analogue therapy. A CT scan 19 months later revealed a contrast-enhancing left kidney tumour that was a G1-grade clear cell carcinoma. Four years after the acromegaly diagnosis multiple myeloma were diagnosed with secondary renal amyloidosis. Genetic screening for a paraganglioma gene panel, AIP, MEN1, and CDKN1B mutations were negative. A next-generation cancer panel containing 94 cancer genes did not identify any possible unifying gene abnormality in her germline DNA. Coexistence of acromegaly and numerous other tumours suggests a common aetiology of these disorders. However, no genetic abnormality could be identified with the tests that have been performed.","290":"The aim of the study was to determine which microperimetry and contrast sensitivity test parameters would prove the most valuable during diagnosing optic chiasm compression due to pituitary adenomas. A control group comprised healthy individuals (Group 1). Patients with pituitary macroadenoma were divided into two groups: Group 2 - absent optic chiasm compression; and Group 3 - present optic chiasm compression detected on contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each group comprised 20 patients (40 eyes), i.e. a total of 60 patients (120 eyes) were examined. A complete ocular examination, intraocular pressure, microperimetry, contrast sensitivity test, kinetic Goldmann visual field, and static Octopus visual field test were performed. Group 1 and 2 variables showed no statistically significant differences with respect to the mean sensitivity (MS) and mean defect (MD) in microperimetry. After dividing the microperimetry area into quadrants, a difference was shown in the mean sensitivity of the lower-nasal quadrant (MS LN) and mean defect of the lower-nasal quadrant (MD LN) between those groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis revealed that the microperimetry parameter - MS LN as well as row D and E contrast sensitivity test could be highly specific in the assessment of early damage of the optic nerve in patients suffering from pituitary adenoma. Microperimetry and contrast sensitivity test are non-invasive diagnostic investigations adjunctive to MRI, which facilitate detection of early chiasmal compression caused by pituitary adenomas.

Antibodies against: intrinsic factor (IFAb), gastric parietal cells (APCA), thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb), thyroglobulin (TgAb), adrenal cortex (AdrenalAb), and pituitary anterior lobe (PituitaryAb) were determined in the blood. 1. The risk of the presence of antibodies against endocrine glands in patients with PA can be classified in order: TPOAb and\/or TgAb - 41.1%, TPOAb - 36.3%, TgAb - 25.0%, TPOAb and TgAb - 20.2%, AdrenalAb - 1.6%, PituitaryAb - 0.8%. 2. TPOAb and\/or TgAb (mainly TPOAb) are more frequently present in patients with PA, who have IFAb and\/or APCA. This correlation is most evident in patients with simultaneous occurrence of IFAb and APCA. 3. Among patients with PA, the simultaneous presence of antibodies IFAb and\/or APCA with TPOAb and\/or TgAb antibodies is most likely in women over 45 years of age. 4. In group C, 12% had at least one of two antithyroid antibodies (TgAb twice as often as TPOAb), and 2.4% had both. AdrenalAb and PituitaryAb are not found in healthy persons. In patients with PA, a screening for autoimmune thyroid disease is justified, which should first involve the determination of TPOAb (further TgAb) in the blood. The assessment of antithyroid antibodies should be recommended primarily to patients with PA, who have IFAb and\/or APCA, and in particular those with concurrent IFAb and APCA.

They have been proven to correlate well with established inflammatory markers such as hsCRP and have a prognostic value among others in patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, and malignancies. The aim of the study was to find markers associated with obesity in young heathy adults. The study group included 321 young healthy adults aged 18-35 years (210 males and 111 females). Partial least squares regression analysis was used to find variables associated with body mass index (BMI), except MHR. Analysed variables included complete blood count, lipid profile, sex hormone levels, acute-phase protein levels, and blood-based inflammatory markers. Variables with the strongest association with BMI in the group of men were HDL% and apolipoprotein B, and in the group of women, HDL, HDL%, triglycerides, and MHR. Novel inflammatory markers were not associated with BMI. We found significant (p &lt; 0.001) correlations between novel biomarkers (NLR, dNLR) and hsCRP and fibrinogen levels in the group of subjects with obesity.

The most commonly used drugs containing cannabinoids are marijuana, hashish, and hashish oil. These compounds exert their effects via interaction with the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Type 1 receptors (CB1) are localised mostly in the central nervous system and in the adipose tissue and many visceral organs, including most endocrine organs. Type 2 cannabinoid receptors (CB2) are positioned in the peripheral nervous system (peripheral nerve endings) and on the surface of the immune system cells. Recently, more and more attention has been paid to the role that endogenous ligands play for these receptors, as well as to the role of the receptors themselves. So far, endogenous cannabinoids have been confirmed to participate in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis of the body, and have a significant impact on the endocrine system, including the activity of the pituitary gland, adrenal cortex, thyroid gland, pancreas, and gonads. Interrelations between the endocannabinoid system and the activity of the endocrine system may be a therapeutic target for a number of drugs that have been proved effective in the treatment of infertility, obesity, diabetes, and even prevention of diseases associated with the cardiovascular system.","299":"Immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies - checkpoint inhibitors - is a dynamically evolving discipline of clinical oncology and a new hope for patients with advanced and disseminated cancer.

One of the main endogenous causes of this disorder is autonomously functioning thyroid nodule (AFTN). Despite the fact that it is usually asymptomatic, SCH entails repercussions on the cardiovascular system and bone, and it carries a risk of progression to overt hyperthyroidism with a typical clinical picture. Treatment is still controversial, and its benefits are widely debated in literature. From 459 patients authors selected a group of 49 patients (10.6% of all subjects with hyperthyroidism), 41 women (83.7%) with AFTN at the stage SCH treated in the Outpatient Endocrinological Clinic and the Department of Endocrinology of the Medical University of Lublin over a three-year period. The method applied in the study was a retrospective analysis of medical records with a particular account of medical history, physical examination, and additional tests obtained during the process of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Forty-one patients (83.7%) suffered from typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism; only eight patients (16.3%) were asymptomatic. The most frequently reported symptoms were tachycardia in women (51.2%) and anxiety in men (50%). The type of thyrostatic drugs and the length of therapy did not affect the outcome of iodine-131 therapy. In the vast majority of the patients (87.8%) radioidodine therapy was effective; 30 patients (61.2%) reached euthyreosis and 13 patients (22.5%) developed hypothyroidism. Most patients with SCH in the course of AFTN suffered from typical symptoms of overt hyperthyroidism; only every sixth patient was asymptomatic. The volume of autonomous adenomas did not affect the result of 131I therapy; however, the impact of AFTN volume as well as the thyroid volume on RIT efficacy requires futher investigation.

We did not find any significant difference in the investigated genes; however, the almost significant overexpression of AGT and underexpression of IL-6 might be noteworthy (p = 0.06 in both cases). No significant differences were found in the expression of the investigated genes known as cardiometabolic risk factors. This indicates that there are no major differences between endogenous hypercortisolism or diet-induced obesity regarding the expression of adipokines involved in cardiometabolic disorders. However, the difference in AGT and IL-6 expression might be included in pathways affecting fat distribution in CS.

Paediatric patients with a BMI above the 85th centile are more often diagnosed with increased TSH levels than are children with proper body weight. The data of 961 overweight and obese children, aged 13 years, recruited in four cities in Poland as part of PoZdro!, a two-year prophylactic program, were analysed to observe the relationship between serum TSH and fT4 concentration and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism parameters, as well as anthropometric parameters. TSH concentration in the study group was positively correlated, whereas fT4 concentration was negatively correlated with WHR and WHtR values, fasting serum glucose concentrations and one-hour glucose concentration, fasting serum insulin concentrations, one-hour and two-hour insulin concentration, ALT serum activity, as well as total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride serum concentrations. An increased risk of metabolic syndrome was diagnosed previously in patients with TSH concentrations &gt; 2.5 mUI\/L. TSH concentration in the upper half of the current reference range (&gt; 2.50 mIU\/L) is associated with an increased risk of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism disorders and therefore increased chances of developing metabolic syndrome. It seems advisable to regularly monitor thyroid function in overweight and obese paediatric patients.

Since ICG invades hypothalamus and\/or pituitary, the endocrine dysfunction is one of the common determinants of these tumors. We presented two brothers with the history of ICG. Patient 1 is a 25-year-old male who had been suffering from the weakness of the right half of his body at the age of 18. Cranial MRI revealed mass lesion in the left thalamus. He underwent neurosurgery, tumor was removed completely. Histopathological (HP) and immunohistochemical analyses verified the diagnosis of pure germinoma. He experienced complete remission of the tumor after a radiation therapy. At the age of 22 the diagnosis of isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) was established and GH replacement was initiated. Patient 2 is a 20-year old boy who was presented with diabetes insipidus at the age of 12. MRI detected tumor in the third ventricle and pineal region. After the endoscopic tumor biopsy the HP diagnosis was pure germinoma. He received chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, and treated with GH during childhood. At the age of 18 GH replacement was reintroduced. A six month follow-up during the next two years in both brothers demonstrated the IGF1 normalization with no MRI signs of tumor recurrence. To the best of our knowledge so far, only six reports have been published related to familial ICG. The presented two brothers are the first report of familial ICG case outside of Japan.

Recently, it may be concluded that the only effective treatment of obesity remains bariatric surgery. The aim of the review was to compare the concepts of appetite hormonal regulation, reasons of obesity development and bariatric procedures published over the last decade. The reviewed publications had been chosen on the base on: 1. reasons and endocrine consequences of obesity; 2. development of surgery methods from the first bariatric to present and future less aggressive procedures; 3. impact of surgery on the endocrine status of patient. The most serious endocrine disturbances during obesity are dysfunctions of hypothalamic circuits responsible for appetite regulation, insulin resistance, changes in hormones activity and abnormal activity of adipocytes hormones. The currently recommended bariatric surgeries are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and adjustable gastric banding. Bariatric surgical procedures, particularly combination of restrictive and malabsorptive, decrease the body weight and eliminate several but not all components of metabolic syndrome. 1.Hunger and satiety are mediated by an interplay of nervous and endocrine signals. 2. Healthy adipose tissue secretion of adipokines is coordinated in an anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing and cardioprotective pattern. However, with increasing fat mass this secretion pattern is changed into a proinflammatory, insulin resistant, atherogenic and fatal systemic environment . 3. Bariatric surgery is not a solution of the obesity problem for everyone. 4. Long term postsurgical observations of the hormonal profile changes are necessary and should be obligatory. ","311":"Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a rare and heterogeneous group of tumours, with a variety of primary origins and variable aggressiveness. NENs with an atypical primary origin, such as breast and retroperitoneal NENs, are extremely rare. As a consequence, an established diagnostic and therapeutic strategy in this particular subgroup is lacking. The combination of capecitabine and temozolomide, called CAPTEM regimen, has produced promising response rates in patients with grade 1 or 2 neuroendocrine tumours of multiple origins. The first is a case of a 68-year-old woman with a metastatic primary breast neuroendocrine tumour, treated with cisplatin plus etoposide as first line, followed by CAV scheme (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine), and subsequently treated, in third line with the CAPTEM regimen, obtaining radiological response and good tolerance. The second is the case of a 66-year-old woman affected by a metastatic primitive retroperitoneal NET G2. The patient progressed after a somatostatin analogue-based first line, whereas the CAPTEM regimen led to a partial and durable response with a favourable safety profile. CAPTEM chemotherapy has been shown to be an active and safe therapeutic option in advanced, metastatic G1\/2 atypical primary NENs.

A 32-year-old man presented to our emergency department because of sudden onset of severe headache. He had a six-month history of paroxysmal headache, palpitations, and sweating. During examination he became somnolent and developed left-sided hemiplegia. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain showed a right temporoparietal haematoma. He was admitted to the Clinic for Neurosurgery and the haematoma was evacuated. The patient was comatose, on assisted respiration, with frequent hypertensive crises. An examination for possible secondary causes of hypertension was undertaken. Plasma metanephrine value was elevated (414 pg\/mL, reference values &lt; 90 pg\/mL). Abdominal CT scans revealed a large mass (6 cm) in the right adrenal gland. After adequate control of the hypertension was achieved with nonselectivealpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers the tumour was excised. The histopathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The genetic analysis demonstrated a duplication in exon 1 of the VHL gene. We reported a rare, potentially fatal complication of pheochromocytoma - an intracerebral haemorrhage.

This study was aimed at investigating sexual function and depressive symptoms in men with overt hyperthyroidism of autoimmune and non-autoimmune origin. The study population consisted of three age-matched groups: men with overt hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease (group A; n = 20), men with overt hyperthyroidism and toxic multinodular goitre or toxic adenoma (group B; n = 21), and men with normal thyroid function (group C; n = 23). As well as measuring serum hormone levels and antibody titres, and determining calculated parameters of thyroid homeostasis, all included patients filled in questionnaires evaluating sexual function (International Index of Erectile Function-15: IIEF-15) and assessing the presence and severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition - BDI-II). Compared with control subjects, men with overt hyperthyroidism obtained lower scores for erectile function, intercourse satisfaction, orgasmic function and overall satisfaction. Scores for erectile function, orgasmic function, and sexual desire differed between both groups of men with thyroid hyperfunction and inversely correlated with thyrotropin receptor antibody titres. The BDI-II score was higher in patients with Graves' disease than in men with normal thyroid function. The obtained results indicate that overt hyperthyroidism in men causes multidimensional impairment of sexual function, which is particularly pronounced if excessive hormone production results from Graves' disease.

No previous study has compared their effect on the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The study enrolled 52 patients with grade 1 and grade 2 arterial hypertension. The participants were divided into two groups treated with either perindopril (4 mg daily) or telmisartan (40 mg daily). Blood pressure, plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis markers, as well as plasma levels of uric acid, interleukins 4, 10, 13 (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at the beginning of the study and six weeks later. Both perindopril and telmisartan reduced systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Although both agents increased serum levels of IL-10, this effect was more pronounced in patients treated with telmisartan. Neither telmisartan nor perindopril affected circulating levels of uric acid, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, IL-4, IL-13, and hsCRP. The effect of telmisartan on IL-10 slightly correlated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity. Treatment-induced changes in IL-10 did not correlate with hypotensive properties of perindopril and telmisartan. The obtained results indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers administered for a short period of time produce a relatively week effect on anti-inflammatory cytokines, limited to IL-10, and stronger for telmisartan than for perindopril.

Factors that influence MMP blood concentration are still being investigated. This research aims to evaluate the concentration of most types of MMPs: collagenases (MMP-1, -3, -8, -13), matrilysin (MMP-7), gelatinase (MMP-9), and metalloelastase (MMP-12) in serum of women in reproductive age in relation with their body mass index (BMI), age, oestradiol, and progesterone concentrations. Blood samples were taken from 54 healthy reproductive-aged women with normal menstrual cycles. The weight and height of all women were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Concentration of MMP-1, -3, -7, -8, -9, -12, and MMP-13 was evaluated using a Procarta Immunoassay Kit. Serum concentrations of oestradiol and progesterone were evaluated by immunochemiluminescence (32 in the proliferative and 20 in the secretory phase of menstrual cycle). The results of the study were statistically calculated using Pearson, Spearman, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Positive correlation between MMP-7, -8, -9, -12, and -13 levels and BMI was demonstrated. Significantly higher concentrations of MMPs were found especially in obese women compared to women with normal BMI. In healthy, regularly menstruating premenopausal women, MMP levels did not correlate with oestradiol and progesterone concentrations.

Being clinically and genetically heterogeneous, it is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to inappropriate therapy. MODY is caused by a single gene mutation. Thirteen genes, defining 13 subtypes, have been identified to cause MODY. A correct diagnosis is important for the right therapy, prognosis, and genetic counselling. Twenty-nine unrelated paediatric patients clinically suspected of having MODY diabetes were analysed using TruSight One panel for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. In this study we identified variants in MODY genes in 22 out of 29 patients (75.9%). Using two genetic tests, NGS and MLPA, we detected both single nucleotide variants and large deletions in patients. Most of the patients harboured a variant in the GCK gene (11\/22), followed by HNF1B (5\/22). The rest of the variants were found in the NEUROD1 and HNF1A genes. We identified one novel variant in the GCK gene: c.596T&gt;C, p.Val199Ala. The applied genetic tests excluded the suspected diagnosis of MODY in two patients and revealed variants in other genes possibly associated with the patient's clinical phenotype. In our group of MODY patients most variants were found in the GCK gene, followed by variants in HNF1B, NEUROD1, and HNF1A genes. The combined NGS and MLPA-based genetic tests presented a comprehensive approach for analysing patients with suspected MODY diabetes and provided a successful differential diagnosis of MODY subtypes.

Genetic testing showed the following mutations in the PRKAR1A gene coding for the regulatory subunit type 1A of the protein kinase A enzyme: c.125dupG (patient 1) and c.15dupT (patient 2). Both these defects lead to inactivation of the PRKAR1A protein and are consequently causative of PPNAD in these patients.

No previous study has prospectively investigated sexual functioning in women receiving these agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of atorvastatin therapy on female sexual function, and depressive symptoms in young women with elevated cholesterol levels. The study included 14 women with elevated cholesterol levels and 14 matched women with normal plasma lipids. Hypercholesterolaemic women were then treated with atorvastatin (20-40 mg daily) for 24 weeks. Apart from measuring plasma lipids, at the beginning and at the end of the study, all participants of the study completed questionnaires evaluating sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index - FSFI) and the presence and severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition - BDI-II). The mean total FSFI score was insignificantly lower, while the BDI-II score was higher in women with hypercholesterolaemia than in the control group. Both groups significantly differed in domain scores for arousal and orgasm. Atorvastatin decreased the domain score for desire, increased the domain score for orgasm, but did not affect the total FSFI score and the remaining domain scores. Moreover, atorvastatin tended to reduce the BDI-II score. Treatment-induced changes in desire, orgasm, and the BDI-II did not correlate with the effect of atorvastatin on plasma lipids. Atorvastatin treatment produces a relatively mild effect on sexual functioning and mood in women, affecting only selected elements of female sexual behaviour.

Although the basis of therapeutic treatment is behavioural treatment, often non-pharmacological effects do not produce the desired effect. Currently there are several drugs with a safe action profile that improve the effect of treatment (5-10% weight reduction). The aim of the paper is to present the potential of modern pharmacotherapy in the treatment of obesity, in terms of mechanism of action, efficacy, and side effects, in order to individualise therapy. The drugs already registered include substances with a variety of mechanisms of action, including phentermine, orlistat, lorcaserin, and liraglutide. Compounded preparations (phenter-mine\/topiramate, naltrexone SR\/bupropion SR) are also available, which, by using low doses of active substances, have beneficial effects while reducing side effects. In addition, several drugs used to treat diabetes, such as metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, and pramlintide, promote weight loss, although their use is reserved for diabetics, especially type 2 patients. Regarding the current alarm-ing epidemiological data there is a need for intensive prevention and treatment of obesity as well as the development of a new form of pharmacotherapy (new substances and treatment regimens) to develop effective, safe, and, above all, long-term effective therapy for the treatment of obesity.","327":"Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder associated with a high risk of cardiovascular complications. In December 2008, due to concerns about the cardiac safety of antihyperglycaemic therapies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a new guidance on special requirements for the demonstration of cardiovascular safety for these medications. In 2012, similar recommendations were made for antidiabetic drug manufacturers by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Since then, both FDA and EMA recommendations have been applied in cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) for several new antihyperglycaemic drugs. Unlike conventional trials, CVOTs are usually placebo controlled, non-inferiority trials that examine the cardiovascular safety of a drug compared to standard of care in large cohorts of patients with high cardiovascular risk or established cardiovascular disease. Patients in CVOTs are also monitored for a longer observation period than in typical randomised controlled trials to provide data on long-term cardiovascular risk. To date, nine CVOTs involving patients with type 2 diabetes have been completed, and at least 13 are still ongoing. These studies focus on a variety of antihyper-glycaemic drugs, including incretin-based agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and insulin formulations. This article takes a critical look at these CVOTs and summarises the results of the completed trials.","328":"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder characterised by a set of phenotypic traits, which include infantile hypotonia, short stature, and morbid obesity. Over the last 12 years, visible progress has been made in medical care management of PWS patients in Poland. Increasing awareness of the disorder in neonatal and paediatric care has led to early identification of the condition in neonates, followed by the institution of an appropriate dietary regime, introduction of physiotherapy, and early-onset recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment. Growth hormone (GH) therapy in Poland is conducted within the nationwide framework of the Therapeutic Programme: \"Treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome\". The therapeutic interventions initiated in the paediatric centres need to be continued in multidisciplinary adult care settings. The main aim of PWS clinical management in adulthood is prevention of obesity and its comor-bidities, treatment of hormonal disorders, mental health stabilisation, nutritional guidance, as well as on-going physiotherapy. Integrated multidisciplinary therapeutic intervention is necessary if patients with such a complex genetic condition as PWS are to not only achieve an average life expectancy but also to enjoy higher quality of life.","329":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis and therapy still arouse a lot of controversy.

In adult female diagnosis, we still use the Rotterdam criteria, which is two out of three of the follwing characteristics: a) ovulation abnormality, b) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and c) polycystic ovaries. In the case of teenagers, diagnostic criteria are as follows: menstruation disturbances two years after menarche and clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism. The presence of polycysti-cally abnormal ovaries is not necessary.

The aim of this study is to study changes in thyroid hormones in patients with brain death (BD). Eleven brain-dead patients were studied prospectively. Thyroid hormones were measured on admission to the intensive care unit, the day before BD diagnosis (BD before), and the day after BD diagnosis (BD day). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) concentrations were found to be significantly low on ad-mission, BD before, and BD day compared to age-matched healthy controls. TSH levels were shown to be increasing on BD day. Free thyroxine (fT4) levels were within normal limits in all cases except in one case having low fT4 levels with normal TSH levels. No statisti-cally significant changes were encountered between admission thyroid hormone levels and BD-before and BD-day thyroid hormone levels. Six patients were on steroid therapy when BD-before blood samples were drawn, and no difference in thyroid hormone levels was encountered between steroid users and non-users. Correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between GCS and TSH, but a negative association between fT3 and APACHE II. We have shown that patients with BD have altered thyroid hormones days before BD diagnosis, and these alterations con-tinue until the diagnosis of BD.

Typical features of AD include memory loss, social dysfunction and physical impairment. Although the pathological findings in the central nervous system are well established, the etiological factors are poorly known. Recent studies suggested the role of metabolic disturbances in the development of AD neurodegeneration. Adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory and metabolism regulating factor, was linked to AD. Aim The aim was to examine whether adiponectin fractions combined with insulin\/insulin resistance-associated metabolic parameters correlate with AD progression. Material and methods The study comprised 98 women: 27 with moderate to severe AD, 31 with AD at early stage and 40 healthy controls, matched for age and BMI. To evaluate memory impairment, the MMSE was performed. Plasma total adiponectin and its high-, medium- and low molecular weights were measured with ELISA. Anthropometric, clinical and metabolic parameters were assessed. Correlations between adiponectin array and measured parameters were evaluated. Results In comparison to the controls, enhanced levels of total and medium molecular weight adiponectin characterized AD individuals. In AD, we found correlations between adiponectin array, and anthropometric and biochemical parameters. After adjustment to BMI, a significant increase of the total adiponectin and high- and medium molecular weight fractions was observed. A negative correlation between low molecular weight adiponectin and MMSE was found. Conclusions Our results indicate a possible link between adiponectin variations and AD. We hypothesize that changes in adiponectin profile observed in AD result from compensatory mechanism against neuropathological processes, as well as from adiponectin homeostasis impairment.","333":"Growth hormone (GH) has been used in the treatment of short stature in children with GH deficiency (GHD) for 60 years, and for about 30 years also in the treatment of adults with GHD, in whom such treatment is carried out due to metabolic indications.

There are two groups of adults (or adolescents after growth completion) with GHD, who require GH therapy: patients with GHD that occurred in childhood (childhood-onset GHD - CO-GHD) and patients with GHD acquired in adulthood (adulthood-onset GHD - AO-GHD). This review presents a brief outline of the history of GH treatment in humans, the latest data on the causes and symptoms of GHD in adults, and the complications of untreated GHD. Current recommendations regarding diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of GH therapy in adults are also discussed.

Intracellularly, chromogranin A contributes to the regulation of secretion and gives several cleavage products after secretion. Some of its cleavage products modify the hormone functions in autocrine and paracrine ways, while the functions of others have not been fully understood yet. Serum chromogranin A level is most prominently used in neuroendocrine tumour diagnostics. In addition, recent studies have suggested that chromogranin A and some of its cleavage products (pancreastatin and WE-14) also play important roles in the pathogenesis of the various forms of diabetes mellitus, but their exact mechanisms still need to be clarified. Higher chromogranin A, pancreastatin, and WE-14 levels have been reported in type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetic patients compared to healthy controls. A notable connection has been inferred through the observation that type 1 diabetes mellitus is not at all or rarely developed in chromogranin A gene-knockout, non-obese diabetic model mice compared to non-knockout, non-obese diabetic mice. Pancreastatin inhibits insulin release in various cell and animal models, and WE-14 serves as an autoantigen for both CD4+ and CD8+ beta cell-destructive diabetogenic T-cell clones in type 1 diabetes. Chromogranin A contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus according to the available literature.

The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the contribution of the cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate\/protein kinase A (cAMP\/PKA) signalling pathway in melatonin-dependent inhibition of OT and VP secretion from the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial (H-NH) system in vitro. The H-NH explants were placed in 1 ml of normal Krebs-Ringer (nK-R) buffer and first preincubated for 30 min in control buffer or in the presence of PKA inhibitor, i.e. cAMPS-Rp or H-89. Next, they were incubated in nK-R buffer {fluid F1} and then in buffer as F1 enriched with melatonin (10-9 M or 10-7 M) and\/or PKA activator, i.e. cAMP analogue (8-Br-cAMP), or their vehicles {fluid F2}. After 20 min of incubation in fluid F1 and then F2, the media were collected and frozen, to be assayed for OT and VP by the RIA. 8-Br-cAMP increased OT and VP secretion when the H-NH explants were preincubated in control medium, while PKA inhibitors eliminated its stimulatory effect on OT and VP release. Melatonin (10-7 M) diminished basal OT and VP output from the H-NH system, and inhibited (at both concentrations studied) the cAMP analogue-stimulated release of both neurohormones under control conditions. The effect of melatonin on OT and VP release was completely blocked when cAMPS-Rp, but not H-89, was used to disrupt the cAMP\/ \/PKA pathway. Melatonin employs the cAMP\/PKA signalling pathway to inhibit OT and VP secretion from the rat H-NH system; nonethe-less, other cAMP-mediated mechanisms are not excluded.

All participants completed questionnaires evaluating sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index - FSFI) and the presence and severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition - BDI-II). The total FSFI and BDI-II scores were lower in Group C than in the remaining groups of women, while the total FSFI score was lower in Groups A and B than in Group D. Patients with both impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance had lower scores in all domains (sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction and dyspareunia). Compared to Group D, Group A was characterized by lower domain scores for sexual desire and sexual satisfaction, while Group B by lower domain scores for desire, arousal and orgasm. In all groups of prediabetic women, the overall FSFI score correlated negatively with the degree of insulin resistance and weakly with the total BDI-II score.

MEN1 syndrome was diagnosed in four patients and MEN2 only once. Pre- and postoperative results of PTH levels and serum calcium values were compared. The mean preoperative serum PTH level was 215,56 pg\/ml, whereas calcium concentration was 1.40 mmol\/l. Three Patients with MEN1 syndrome had three and two thirds of parathyroid gland taken, and one had a single parathyroid gland excised with biopsy of the rest glands performed. A patient with MEN2 syndrome had one parathyroid gland excised. Postoperatively, we reported decreased secretion of both PTH (a mean serum PTH concentration 6.72 pg\/ml), and serum calcium concentration 1.11 mmol\/l. One patient (25%) with MEN 1 developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism after five years from the surgery. The patient was reoperated. The rest of the parathyroid gland was removed with an implantation into separated muscle pockets in the anterior forearm muscles. 1. MEN syndrome is a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. 2. Subtotal parathyroidectomy helps to bring back a normal calcium metabolism. 3.

The patient had one year history of dermatological skin problems. Ultrasound examination of abdomen performed because of arterial hypertension, revealed multiple hepatic lesions, which was confirmed in contrast enhanced CT. The typical contrast enhanced metastatic lesions in CT and elevated levels of chromogranin A suggested NET of unknown origin. SRS with 99mTc-HYNICTOC was perform for primary tumor localization, and revealed liver and paraaortic lymph nodes metastases, but no sign of primary tumor location. As a next step for primary tumor localization 68Ga-DOTATATE PET\/CT was done, which revealed focus of increased uptake in small intestine considered to be the primary tumor site. The imaging and clinical history of patient was discussed on ENETS Tumor Board. Due to location of primary tumor in the small intestine with no anatomical changes in CT, laparotomy guided with gamma probe after 68Ga-DOTATATE injection was performed. During surgery procedure, the primary tumor was hardly palpable in the tip of Meckel's diverticulum, confirmed by gamma probe.

However, the mechanisms underlying synovitis and the inflammatory environment remain unclear. This study analyzed the proinflammatory mediation expression of IL-17 and Th17, which perform key functions in regulating inflammatory processes in the inflamed synovium and peripheral blood in ONFH. Synovial fluid from the hips of 23 patients and 5 controls was collected during surgery, and peripheral blood samples were obtained from 34 patients and 9 controls. The expression of IL-17 in the synovium was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the levels of Th17 and IL-17 in the blood were measured by flow cytometry and ELISA. Pain assessment was performed for all the patients and controls. An inflamed synovium was characterized by increased leukocyte infiltration and IL-17 expression in comparison with the control. Preoperative levels of Th17 and IL-17 were significantly higher in the peripheral blood of the ONFH group than those in the controls. The symptoms were also positively correlated with the Th17 levels of the ONFH patients. Th17 cells were recruited to an inflamed synovium, and inflammatory cytokine IL-17 was expressed at an increased level in the hip synovium of ONFH patients, which possibly contributed to clinical syndrome development. Overall, this study will help in identifying new therapeutic strategies for ONFH, especially the targeting of IL-17 to decrease inflammation and pain. &lt; p &gt; &lt; \/p &gt;.

The study comprised 269 metabolically healthy adults and 300 patients with T2DM. Anthropometric and bio-chemical indices were measured, including total and HMW adiponectin levels; the Homeostatic Model Assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated, and logistic regression analysis was used to predict the presence of IR. In healthy individuals, both total and HMW adiponectin levels were significantly higher than in diabetic patients. Total and HMW adiponectin levels were moderately correlated with the HOMA-IR index.

Forty-five female New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into controls, diabetes, and diabetes treated with oxytocin (ip, 0.78 mg\/kg) for six months. Marrow fat fraction (FF) was determined by proton MR spectroscopy at baseline, and at three and six months. Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Serum biomarkers, glycolipid metabolism, and histological analysis of marrow adipocytes were determined. Oxytocin treatment had positive metabolic effects in diabetic rabbits, which was based on the changes in glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and lipid profiles. The diabetic rabbits demonstrated dramatic marrow adiposity in a time-dependent manner; at three and six months the FF percentage changes from baseline were 10.1% and 25.8%, respectively (all P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, oxytocin treatment significantly reversed FF values and quantitative parameters of marrow adipocyte in diabetic rabbits to levels of naive control rabbits.

Hypercortisolaemia was found in 50 (14%) patients, while overt hypercortisolaemia was found in 31 patients. In the hypercortisolaemia group, ACTH-dependent hypercortisolaemia was diagnosed in five (10%) and ACTH-independent hypercortisolaemia in 25 patients (50%). One patient with overt hypercortisolaemia had cancer of the adrenal cortex. The remaining 19 (38%) patients had subclinical Cushing's syndrome. For our study, we compared patients with ACTH-independent hypercortisolaemia (n = 25) with those with Cushing's syndrome (n = 19). Patients with ACTH-dependent hyper-cortisolaemia (n = 5) and the patient with cancer of the adrenal cortex (n = 1) were excluded.

In this study we used mass spectrometry imaging to detect lipids discriminating papillary cancer from not cancerous thyroid directly in formalin-fixed tissue sections. For this purpose imaging and profiling of lipids present in non-malignant and cancerous thyroid tissue specimens were conducted. High resolution MALDI-Q-Ion Mobility-TOF-MS technique was used for lipidomic analysis of formalin fixed thyroid tissue samples. Lipids were identified by the comparison of the exact molecular masses and fragmentation pathways of the protonated molecule ions, recorded during the MS\/MS experiments, with LIPID MAPS database.

ATC usually manifests itself with the local symptoms due to a rapidly enlarging thyroid mass, and as other thyroid cancers, has only seldom been reported to cause thyrotoxicosis. Up to now only 9 cases of ATC with concomitant thyrotoxicosis have been described. We report a rare case of a 66-year-old woman, who had had the preexisting large, euthyroid multinodular goiter for almost 50 years. She was consulted by a doctor because of a 4-week history of thyrotoxicosis, symptoms of the congestive heart failure and a rapid increase in the size of the goiter. Thyroid hormone levels were consistent with a hyperthyroid state. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, the small cells variant.

The patient died a one year after the first symptoms of the disease occurred. The association between ATC and a thyrotoxic state is very rare. In most cases, thyrotoxicosis concomitant with ATC was thought to be a result of the destruction of the thyroid follicles by the rapid infiltration with malignant cells, resulting in the leakage of preformed hormones to the circulation. In that case the most probable cause of thyrotoxicosis was the multinodular goiter coexisting with ATC.

We present an 82-year-old female, in whom an asymptomatic cerebellar metastasis from PTC was diagnosed by means of Tc-99m-EDDA\/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy four years after the initial diagnosis. She was previously treated with total thyroidectomy and regional lymph node dissection, followed by three cycles of radioiodine therapy. Despite persistently elevated thyroglobulin, no specific radioiodine accumulation was found in the whole body post-treatment scan.

Despite improving male sexual functioning, levothyroxine treatment does not always restore all its aspects. The aim of this study was to compare male sexual function-ing and depressive symptoms between men with hypothyroidism receiving levothyroxine\/liothyronine combination therapy and men receiving levothyroxine alone. The study population consisted of 21 young levothyroxine-treated men with clinical symptoms of hypothyroid-ism, in whom serum thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels were within the normal limits. In 11 of these patients, levothyroxine was replaced with levothyroxine\/liothyronine combination therapy, while the remaining ones (n = 10) continued levothyroxine treatment. Beyond measuring serum levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, and prolactin, before the beginning of the study and six months later, all enrolled patients completed questionnaires evaluating male sexual function (International Index of Erectile Func-tion-15: IIEF-15) and assessing the presence and severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition - BDI-II). The study included 10 patients from each group. At baseline, erectile function, intercourse satisfaction, orgasmic function, sexual desire and overall satisfaction, as well as the total BDI-II score did not differ between both groups. With the exception of an improvement in sexual desire, replacing levothyroxine with levothyroxine\/liothyronine combination therapy did not affect sexual functioning and depressive symptoms. The obtained results suggest that levothyroxine\/liothyronine combination therapy has a relatively mild effect on sexual functioning in levothyroxine-treated men with normal thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels experiencing clinical symptoms of hypo-thyroidism. ","381":"Despite TSH screening in newborns is currently conducted in most developed countries, patients with thyroid ectopy born before the procedure was introduced or those in whom the screening failed to establish diagnosis, might still appear. In the paper we revise the current state of knowledge regarding the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of patients with thyroid ectopy. As an example, we report diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties in our three patients with thyroid ectopy remaining undiagnosed and untreated during early childhood. Introduction of neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism does not guarantee that all patients with thyroid ectopy will be correctly diagnosed and properly treated due to the possibility of falsely negative result of TSH screening or lack of compliance from parents. Visualization of an ectopic thyroid on ultrasound examination may be challenging for unexperienced sonographists; muscles in the thyroid bed may be misdiagnosed as heterogeneous and hypoechogenic thyroid gland with features suggesting autoimmune thyroid disease. Thyroid scintiscan is crucial for confirmation of the diagnosis of thyroid ectopy. In conclusion, hypothyroidism due to thyroid developmental anomaly should be taken into consideration in case of hypothyroidism and normal thyroid autoantibodies in a patient at any age.","382":"Short stature is the main problem that paediatric endocrinologists have to grapple with. Endocrine disorders account for only 5% of patients with short stature, but this is still one of the most common causes of reports to the endocrine clinic and hospitalisation in the endocrine department. A properly functioning growth hormone\/insulin-like growth factor (GH\/IGF) axis is one of the most important factors in proper growth. A lot of genetic defects in this axis lead to syndromes marked by impaired growth, like Laron syndrome, muta-tions in the STAT5B, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and mutations in the acid labile subunit (ALS). Two proteases important for the proper functioning of the GH\/IGF axis: pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A2 (PAPP-A2), have been described. The first description of the new syndrome of growth failure associated with mutation in the PAPP-A2 gene was given by Andrew Dauber et al. This review evaluates the current data concerning PAPP-A2 function, and particularly the effect of PAPP-A2 mutation on growth.","383":null,"384":"Because the majority of antidiabetic medications are of limited efficacy and patient compliance with treatment is usually poor, new therapies are still being searched for. In the review a newly developed system for treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes and concomitant overweight\/obesity is described. The system consists of an implantable pulse generator that delivers electrical stimuli through leads implanted in the sero-muscular layer of the stomach. The device recognises and automatically modulates natural electrical activity of the stomach during meals, strengthening gastric contractility. This increase in the force of contractions enhances vagal afferent activity. Modulated signals are transmitted to the regulatory centres in the brain in order to provoke an early response of the gut typical of a full meal. Clinical trials performed to date show that the system improves glycaemic control with minimal patient compliance needed and with added benefits of body weight loss, a decrease in blood pressure, and favourable changes in the lipid profile. The system is safe, well-tolerated, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, and will probably become an alternative to the use of incretins or to bariatric surgery in obese patients who are unwilling to undergo a major and anatomically irreversible operation.","385":"Glucocorticoids (GCs) play a pivotal role in carbohydrate metabolism. They counteract insulin by decreasing peripheral glucose uptake and stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis, although they are best known for inducing insulin resistance (IR). Moreover, GCs may attenuate the incretin effect. Nevertheless, their direct impact on beta cells is not fully defined. This review aims to present the current understanding of this subject. Humans exposed to GC excess display IR, impaired glucose tolerance, and eventually develop diabetes. Although their insulin levels are elevated, they present lower insulin output in response to glucose than obese individuals. Rodent models demonstrate that GC-induced IR is accompanied by compensatory beta-cell hyperplasia. GC excess with high-fat diet leads to fasting hyperglycaemia and suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) despite increased beta cell mass. The majority of in vitro studies confirm an inhibitory GC effect on insulin secretion. The mechanism remains ambiguous but might involve its direct influence upon expression of molecules essential for glucose sensing and metabolism, enhanced glucose cycling, down-regulated insulin gene transcription, hampered insulin exocytosis, amplified alpha-adrenergic signalling, and\/or increased beta-cell apoptosis. There are also reports that suggest increased GSIS after beta cell exposure to GCs in vitro. Transgenic mice with enhanced corticosterone regeneration within their beta cells present augmented secretory capacity of their islets. To summarise, GCs exert a significant role in carbohydrate balance through various mechanisms, including direct impact on beta cell function. Observed discrepancies may arise from differences in study design. A thorough understanding of GC action will provide important clinical clues for disorders of glucose homeostasis.","386":"","387":"","388":"Sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) are commonly present in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment is reported to improve breathing function in PWS, but the findings are not explicit. Screening polysomnography- polygraphy (PSG), assessing nasal respiratory flow, respiratory effort, and blood oxygen saturation, was used. Group 1 - before rhGH therapy (n = 11, mean age 3.0 years); PSG was repeated after the start of rhGH therapy in a mean time of 0.9 years in six patients (Group 1a). Group 2 - on rhGH treatment, for a mean time of four years (n = 17, mean age 8.8 years). Group 3 - without rhGH therapy due to severe obesity (n = 8, mean age 13.1 years).

We included 70 rats divided into seven groups (n = 10 in each). Rats of group I were intact. Newborn rats of groups II-VII were injected with monosodium glutamate (MSG) (4 mg\/g). Rats of group II (MSG-obesity group) were untreated. The group III-V received lyophilised monoprobiotics B. animalis VKL, B. animalis VKB, and L. casei IMVB-7280, respectively. Group VI received the mix of these three probiotic strains. Group VII was treated with multiprobiotic \"Symbiter\", which contains 14 live probiotic strains (Lactobacillus, Bifi-dobacterium, Propionibacterium, Acetobacter genera). Neonatal treatment with MSG caused stunted growth, which is why, despite the lack of weight gain dynamics and absence of significant food consumption rate and body weight changes at day 120, we noted the development of obesity in all MSG-obesity rats and in up to 20-70% after probiotic administration. Supplementation of probiotic composition, with preference to live strains, led to a significantly lower prevalence of obesity, and reduction of VAT weight and serum lipid levels as compared to single-strain probiotic. In our comparative single-strain analysis a trend towards more pronounced hypolipidaemic effect and VAT weight reduction was observed for lyophilised L. casei IMVB-7280 as compared to B. animalis VKL and VKB strains. Multistrain formed mutualistic interactions in mixtures and therefore able to share with different metabolites, affect differ-ent receptors and produced various of biologically active compounds which synergistic overall effect greater than the sum of the single effects.

A total of 1063 patients, treated between October 2012 and March 2013 in the Diabetes and Endocrinology Centre in Bydgoszcz, were enrolled in the study. Only patients who were first diagnosed with diabetes and consecutively with cancer were included in the analysis. The final dataset compromised data from 1028 patients with type 2 diabetes, in whom retrospective analysis of the association between the occurrence of cancer and treatment with or without metformin was performed. Demographic data, medical history, physical assessment, diabetes history, diabetes complications, concomitant medication, and additional examination results were compared between two groups: those with cancer and those without cancer. Data were analysed using Student's t-test, Chi-square test with Yates' continuity correction, and multiple logistic regression. The most commonly observed cancer was breast cancer (24 patients; 22.5%), followed by uterine cancer (15 patients; 13.6%). Of the 75 diabetic patients with a cancer diagnosis, 18.7% were treated with metformin; of the 953 patients without cancer, 38% received metformin. Analysis of probability of cancer occurrence using Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the probability of cancer development was higher in groups of patients who were not treated with metformin (p = 0.006). Metformin treatment reduces the risk of cancer in type 2 diabetes patients. ","392":null,"393":null,"394":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignant thyroid tumor.

Typical example is the tall cell variant (TCV). Patients experience a greater incidence of recurrence, nodal and extranodal metastases, tumor associated mortality than other variants of PTC. Studies related to TCV almost always compared it with its patient population of PTC according to risk factors and clinicopathologic features. The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk factors in metastatic\/recurrent TCV. This is a retrospective cohort study of 1813 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma treated with radioiodine between 1992 and 2011. 56 of these patients are TCV. 34 of them developed metastasis\/recurrence and 22 lived a disease-free life during the 23-year follow-up. We evaluated the risk factors in these metastatic and nonmetastatic subgroups. We found tumor size, preablation thyroglobulin level, vascular invasion, preablation central and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis, preablation lung metastasis and stage independent risk factors. However age, preablation thyroglobulin level and stage appeared together as striking factors impacting metastasis in multivariate analysis. Higher ablation doses up to 250-300 mCi should be administered to TCV patients having advanced stage (III,IV), pretty high preablation thyroglobulin level (over 400 ng\/ml) and older age (over 52 years) especially with large tumor size (over 3.5 cm) and initial cervical lymph node metastasis.

Traditionally thought to require lifelong therapy it turns out to be a reversible condition in some patients. We present a case of a 22-year old man with absent puberty due to KS, in whom genetic testing revealed heterozygosity for a mutation in the PROK2 gene. Pubertal development and virilisation was achieved by using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injections followed by testosterone replacement. During the follow-up we observed reversal of hypogonadism allowing discontinuation of testosterone treatment. Normalisation of testicular volume as well as gonadotropin and inhibin B levels through a 2-year postreversal period was seen. Treatment with hCG is effective in inducing pubertal development and may have advantage over testosterone replacement due to a potential of gonadal maturation. A regular assessment of testicular volume and biochemical surveillance including measuring of serum inhibin B and gonadotropins are necessary for a timely detection of reversal of GnRH deficiency. ","397":"Background The majority of pituitary adenomas are sporadic, but about 5% of them occur in a familial setting, predominantly in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and Carney complex. Familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA), unrelated to the syndromes mentioned above, were also described. The clinical course of FIPA differs significantly from sporadic cases, and is characterized by a larger tumor size, more aggressive course and younger patients' age at the moment of recognition. Objectives The aim of this retrospective study is to present 4 families in which two closely related people were diagnosed with pituitary adenomas. Probably these cases are clinical manifestations of FIPA. Material and methods Eight patients within four families, presenting with anterior pituitary tumors were described. The authors analyzed medical and family histories of the patients, their imaging pictures (pituitary MRI\/CT) and hormonal tests. Results Family 1.: two sisters with acromegaly in the course of macroadenoma. Family 2.: two brothers with clinically nonsecreting macroadenomas. Family 3.: father and daughter with clinically nonsecreting macroadenomas. Family 4.: young man with acromegaly caused by macroadenoma and a daughter of his mother`s sister with microprolactinoma. Familial isolated pituitary adenomas are more common than it was previously thought, therefore, specific questioning regarding family history should be a part of the workup of all patients with pituitary adenomas. Genetically induced pituitary tumors often have aggressive behavior in terms of tumor expansion and resistance to different treatment options and often involve a multidisciplinary approach that combines endocrine, neurosurgical, and radiological specialists.

We report a case of a 42-year-old woman with rapidly growing mass in the right lower neck, primarily diagnosed in fineneedle aspiration cytology as a low-differentiated carcinoma. After the surgery, exclusion of all the other possible primary tumour locations, and immunohistochemistry tests, the diagnosis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid gland was established. Because of close surgical margins and metastatic neck node, the patient was referred to adjuvant postoperative irradiation. With five-year follow-up the patient is free of disease and still in very good condition.","400":"The ACTH receptor (ACTHR) is primarily expressed in the adrenal cortex. Previous studies focused on the regulatory function of ACTHR in glucocorticoid secretion, but research on adrenal tumours is rare. The aim of this study was to evaluate ACTHR expression in common adrenal adenomas and investigate its influence on adrenal tumorigenesis using adrenocortical H295R cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to detect the expression of ACTHR in 18 aldosterone-producing adenomas, 16 cortisol-producing adenomas, 9 non-functional adenomas, and 12 normal adrenal samples. Lentiviral vector pLVX-mCMV-ACTHR-ZsGreen was transfected into the H295R cells to increase ACTHR expression. WST-1 and cell count were applied to evaluate cell proliferation at different ACTHR levels. TUNEL staining was used to measure cell apoptosis. Compared with normal adrenal samples, the aldosterone-producing adenoma samples had higher ACTHR mRNA and protein levels. However, the mRNA and protein levels of ACTHR in non-functional adenomas and cortisol-producing adenomas were lower than those in the normal adrenal samples. Proliferative activity in the experimental cells was higher than that in the control cells in the first three days. The proliferative activity peaked in the second day. However, this trend was reversed in the fourth day and became more apparent with time. By contrast, TUNEL staining showed that ACTHR overexpression did not induce a significant difference between the two groups. Differential ACTHR expression may be determined by different types of adrenocortical tumours. ACTHR is more likely to have induced the proliferation rather than the apoptosis of H295R cells.

We found statistically significant associations between rs10830963 and GDM using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) [GG genotype vs. CC genotype: OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.38-2.10; G allele vs C allele: OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.20-1.36; GG+CG vs. CC (dominant model): OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.20-1.44; GG vs CG+CC (recessive model): OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.26-1.58]. In subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity, we also observed rs10830963 to be associated with significantly increased risk of GDM in all genetic models in the Chinese population.

A total sample of 153 participants in clinical groups underwent a cross-sectional assessment including the quality of life (AcroQoL, WHOQoL-BREF), psychiatric morbidity (GHQ-28), and the acceptance of illness (AIS), as well as 65 participants in the healthy control group. The whole study sample had a predominance of urban married females (61%) with medium level of education (41%). Patients with acromegaly were diagnosed significantly later than patients from other clinical groups, after the onset of the first symptoms. Acromegaly was related to the presence of more symptoms of anxiety and insomnia, and poorer social relationships compared with the general population but not more than in other chronic diseases. A better quality of life score in all domains of WHOQoL-BREF was associated with a better score on the acceptance of illness scale and lower scores on GHQ-28. Psychiatric morbidity, mainly anxiety and insomnia, occurs in 50% of patients with acromegaly. However, the psychological wellbeing and mood seem to be related to other factors such as the acceptance of the illness. Thus, concerning the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of acromegaly an interdisciplinary approach, taking into account psychological and psychiatric consultation, is needed.

Additionally, calcium and PTH concentrations were assessed at the study onset and after a three-month supplementation. Only 67 women adhered to the prescribed therapeutic regime during the three months of observation. The mean vitamin D concentration in the entire study group was 16.56 ng\/mL, being 12.6 ng\/mL in Group 1 and 25.22 ng\/mL in Group 2. In the course of vitamin D administration, its concentration increased statistically significantly, both in the entire group and in the subgroups, at all time points compared with the study onset. Moreover, its concentration in the whole population and in Group 1 was significantly higher in each of the time points not only in relation to the baseline, but also in comparison with the results of the previous measurements (after 1 and 2 months of supplementation). In Group 2, vitamin D levels also increased systematically throughout the whole study period, and after 3 months its concentration was significantly higher than after 1 and 2 months. Although there were no differences in calcium concentration after those three months, a statistically significant drop of PTH (p &lt; 0.05) was recorded in the entire population and in Group 1. A moderate deficiency of vitamin D was observed in the studied population of young women. A supplementation with calcium plus vitamin D brought about an increase of vitamin D concentration as early as in the first month of administration. The optimal concentration of &gt; 30 ng\/mL was achieved in Group 1 after three months of vitamin D administration in 1500 IU\/d dose.

This sample represents 13.6% of the total expected 1200 Romanian patients with acromegaly and covers 82.9% of the counties in Romania. Control of acromegaly was defined as a random serum growth hormone (GH) &lt; 1 ng\/mL and an age-normalised serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) value. The GH and IGF-I values used for calculation of the control rate were those at the last evaluation. The same assays for GH and IGF-I measurement were used in all patients. There were 147 treated and 17 untreated patients. Of the 147 patients assessed after therapy, 137 (93.2%) had pituitary surgery, 116 (78.9%) were on medical treatment at the last evaluation, and 67 (45.5%) had radiotherapy. Seventy-one (48.3%) had a random GH &lt; 1 ng\/mL, 54 (36.7%) had a normalised, age-adjusted IGF-I, and 42 (28.6%) had both normal random serum GH and IGF-I.

According to recommendations of the most important diabetes associations, this is the first-choice drug for use as monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Metformin is also recommended in combined treatment when monotherapy is no longer effective. It is then combined with a sulfony-lurea, an incretin, flozin, or insulin, irrespective of the number of insulin injections per day. Besides its properties used in the treatment of diabetes, metformin has been treated for some time as a drug of a so-called pleiotropic activity, as each year brings new reports about its favourable effect in different conditions. At present, the scope of reimbursed indications of this drug has been expanded to include prediabetes, insulin resistance syndromes, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Metformin does not stimulate insulin secretion by the beta cells of the pancreas, and thus it is a drug that does not cause hypoglycaemia. The blood glucose-lowering effect of the drug is a consequence of hepatic glucose production inhibition, and of peripheral tissue (muscle tissue, fatty tissue) sensitisation to the effect of insulin of both endogenous and exogenous origin. The exact mechanism of metformin action at the cellular level remained unknown for a long time. Studies performed in recent years have provided a great deal of information that enables better understanding of the mechanism of action of the drug as well as the clinical effects resulting from its use. Metformin, besides improvement of glycaemia, is neutral to body weight, is cardioprotective, improves lipid profile, and has a probable anti-cancer effect. Metformin accumulation in the intestinal mucosa may interfere with FDG (18F-deoxyglucose) PET-CT image assessment. The aim of this article is a detailed discussion of metformin properties, its mechanisms of action, and clinical effects.","407":"EUS-guided ethanol ablation of insulinoma is a new method of treatment of this neuroendocrine tumour. Ablation is recommended in patients who are poor surgical candidates or refuse surgery. We present a case of an 81-year-old female with symptomatic insulinoma, treated successfully with EUS-guided alcoholic ablation, along with a literature review including 28 other previously described cases. The effectiveness, safety of the therapy, and technical procedure-related issues are summarised. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first described case of successful insulinoma EUS-guided ablation in Poland. We searched the PubMed\/Medline database to identify cases of EUS-guided alcoholic ablation. Our analysis included 14 articles (case reports or case series), with a total of 27 patients and 31 tumours described, published before February 2017. The described tumours were relatively small (mean 13 mm), and the most common location was pancreatic head. The mean ethanol volume injected to the tumour was 1.8 ml and the concentration of infused alcohol varied from 95% to 98%.Side effects were observed in six cases; apart from one, they were mild and self-limiting. There was only one severe adverse event, treated conservatively with success. The median follow-up was 14.4 months (2-55 months). In all described cases ablation led to improvement of the symptoms and normalisation of glycaemia. The EUS-guided alcoholic ablation of insulinoma is a safe and effective method of treatment in patients who are poor surgical candidates and\/or refuse surgery. The adverse effects are rare and mild and were observed when the volume of injected ethanol was equal to or above 3.0 ml. However, the data is limited, the follow-up is relatively short, and prospective studies are needed to confirm the long-term effects of treatment. The study shows also that there are important procedural differences (concentration and volume of alcohol, needle gauge, number of sessions) between the endoscopists, which should be specified.

In many cases, only an adequate supply of one of these microelements (e.g. iodine) may reveal symptoms resulting from deficits of other microelements (e.g. iron or selenium). Selenium is accounted to the trace elements of key importance for homeostasis of the human system, in particular, for the proper functioning of the immune system and the TG. Results of epidemiological studies have demonstrated that selenium deficit may affect as many as one billion people in many countries all over the world. A proper sequence of particular supplementations is also worth emphasising for the significant correlations among the supplemented microelements. For example, it has been demonstrated that an excessive supplementation of selenium may enhance the effects of iodine deficit in endemic regions, while proper supplementation of selenium in studied animals may alleviate the consequences of iodine excess, preventing destructive-inflammatory lesions in the TG.

In addition, CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) cooperatively interact with the TCR complex to affect autoimmune processes central to the pathogenesis of HT. Nevertheless, their role in HT aetiology has been less well established. In this study, we aimed to explore mRNA expression levels of CTLA4, CD28, CD45, and VDR in T-cells, across different outcomes of HT. The study included 45 HT patients and 13 euthyroid, healthy controls. T-lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, total mRNA was extracted from T-cells, and gene expression was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ImageQuant method relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RT-PCR products. Nominally higher expression levels of VDR, CTLA4, CD28, and CD45RAB mRNA were found in unsorted T-lymphocytes of healthy controls when compared to the HT patients. No difference was observed between hypothyroid\/untreated, spontaneously euthyroid and LT4-treated HT patients. VDR mRNA expression was linked to both T3 levels and CTLA4 gene expression, whilst CD45RB mRNA expression coincided with CTLA4 and CD28 transcript levels. Conversely, older age and lower T3 levels were associated with increased abundance of CD45R0 isoform in HT patients. The results suggest a cross talk between endocrine and immune functions in HT pathology: an altered peripheral T cell mRNA profile with reduced VDR, CTLA4, CD28, and CD45RAB transcript levels is accompanied by age-related shift from naive to memory\/late-differentiated T cell CD45R mRNA signature and associated with thyroid hormone status in the HT patients.

Malignant lesions are rare in the sellar region, while pituitary adenomas are the most common pathology. These are benign neoplasms with insidious onset and low proliferation activity, and therefore are only exceptionally detected by 18F-FDG PET\/CT. Studies that compare the biology of pituitary adenomas and their radiological properties using PET\/CT are still lacking. We investigate and discuss tumour biology in light of increased 18F-FDG avidity in a symptom-free, 70-year-old male patient, previously treated for two different malignancies (lung and rectal). Increased tracer accumulation in the sellar region was incidentally detected on a follow-up 18F-FDG PET\/CT scan. Additional MRI disclosed pituitary adenoma. Normal hormonal status was found, consistent with the diagnosis of non-functioning pituitary adenoma. Analysis of tumour tissue after pituitary surgery confirmed a silent gonadotroph adenoma with low proliferation index. Low expression of oncogene-induced senescence markers did not support senescence as the explanation for the tumour's low proliferative activity although it was in consonance with the hormonal activity. Pituitary adenomas can manifest as hypermetabolic foci on 18F-FDG PET\/CT imaging with increased tracer uptake even in indolent, clinically silent pituitary adenomas with low mitotic activity. Special attention should be paid to evaluation of 18F-FDG avid pituitary adenomas in patients with multiple malignancies, bearing in mind that avidity does not always mirror its biological behaviour. ","415":"Changes in sensitivity to insulin occur in the course of a number of endocrine disorders. Most of the hormones through their antagonistic action to insulin lead to increased hepatic glucose output and its decreased utilisation in peripheral tissues. Carbohydrate disorders observed in endocrine diseases result from the phenomenon of insulin resistance, and in some cases also a reduction in insulin secretion is present. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism are observed in acromegaly, but also in growth hormone deficiency, hypercortisolism in the course of Cushing's syndrome, hyper- or hypothyroidism, primary hyperparathyroidism, aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, congenital hypertrophy of the adrenal glands, polycystic ovaries syndrome, hypogonadism, or other hormonally active neuroendocrine tumours. They are of a secondary nature in relation to impaired hormonal balance. Hyperglycaemia is therefore often reversible, and the most effective method of treatment of impaired insulin sensitivity is successful therapy of specific endocrinopathies. Insulin sensitisers, also with a good effect, are used. Most experiences to date can be attributed to metformin therapy. Attempts have been made at treatment with other agents that are also effective in reducing insulin resistance as incretins or glitazones. In the presented paper, the authors reviewed endocrine diseases in which there is a clinically significant change in insulin sensitivity. Moreover, methods of therapy of concomitant disturbed glucose metabolism were presented.","416":"Calcitonin gene-related peptide is an important vasodilator. It plays an important role in the metabolism of chewing muscles. The aim of the study was to evaluate the plasma level of CGRP in patients with myofascial pain (RDC\/TMD Ia) and myofascial pain with limited opening (RDC\/TMD Ib) before and after occlusal splint therapy (Michigan splint). A randomised trial was performed including 39 patients (males = 3, females = 36). Blood samples were taken from the external jugular vein (JUG) and cubital vein (CUB) before and after 30 days of occlusal splint therapy. Plasma levels of CGRP were measured with ELISA KIT for Human Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) 96T (USCNK Business Co. Ltd.). The results of the study show that the plasma CGRP level was higher in the external jugular vein (JUG1 = 5.07pg\/mL [SD = 1.99]) than in cubital vein (CUB1 = 4.3 pg\/mL [SD = 1.6]). After 30 days of the occlusal splint therapy the levels in both veins increased: JUG2 = 6.07 pg\/mL (SD = 2.19), and CUB2 = 4.9 pg\/mL (SD = 1.4). The CGRP plasma level increase was statistically significant only in the external jugular vein (JUG) (p &lt; 0.05). Statistically significant pain intensity reduction was observed: VAS1 = 5.4 (SD = 2.08) decreased to VAS2 = 1.7 (SD = 2.07) after splint therapy (p &lt; 0.05). Venepuncture of an external jugular vein is more precise, than venepuncture of a cubital vein in evaluating CGRP plasma level changes in patients with TMD.

The study included 23 patients with PHPT with hypercalcaemia &gt; 12.5 mg\/dL, qualified for surgery. We recorded clinical and biochemical data at baseline, and after every week of treatment. We also monitored adverse events. Cinacalcet was adminis-tered in increasing doses until the corrected serum calcium concentration was 11.3 mg\/dL or less, the patient reached the highest possible dosage of 90 mg four times daily, or the patient experienced an adverse event that precluded further dosage increases. The primary end point of reduction in corrected serum calcium concentration to 11.3 mg\/dL was achieved in 19 patients (83%), and normocalcaemia (S-Ca &lt; 10.3 mg\/dL) was achieved in 55% of patients. The medication was usually well tolerated (83.4%). Most common adverse events were nausea and vomiting, especially at the beginning of therapy; however, only one patient withdrew from the study because of adverse events. Cinacalcet rapidly reduced serum calcium in PHPT patients with severe hypercalcaemia and can be useful as a short-term pretreatment prior to surgery, allowing the completion of diagnostics and safe awaiting for operation. ","418":"Glucocorticoids represent the therapy of choice for active and moderate-to-severe Graves' orbitopathy (GO). In some patients, rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against the cluster of differentiation (CD) 20 receptor of B-lymphocytes, can serve as a second-line or an alternative treatment. The effect of very low-dose of rituximab on the clinical activity of GO and corresponding clinical or laboratory changes is reported. Changes of Clinical Activity Score (CAS) for GO, proptosis, levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies, and depletion of CD19+ and CD20+ B-lymphocytes were determined in ten patients (two men and eight women) with active moderate-to-severe GO treated with a single 100-mg dose of rituximab. Correlations between differences of clinical and laboratory parameters were performed. A significant decrease of CAS was found during subsequent examinations compared to the baseline values. A significant depletion of CD19+ and CD20+ B-lymphocytes was detected after rituximab administration. Differences between follow-up and baseline levels of CD20+ positively correlated with differences in CAS after six (p &lt; 0.05) and 12 months (p &lt; 0.01). Differences in CD19+ levels correlated with differences in CAS after 12 months (p &lt; 0.05) of the treatment. Two patients developed dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON) requiring orbital decompression. No other rituximab side effects were reported during the whole study duration. A single very low-dose of rituximab appears to be very well tolerated and effective enough to reduce clinical activity in active moderate-to-severe GO patients without impending DON.

We aim to elucidate their involvement in the pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas and to establish the correlation of their expression with different growth factors and growth factor receptors known to have a prognostic and\/or therapeutic role. Sixty-one cases of pituitary adenomas were immunohistochemically assessed for the expression of GFAP and S100 protein in both tumour cells and FS cells, in close relationship with hormone profile, and correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, previously studied by our team. GFAP and S100 protein were expressed both in tumour cells and FS cells. Differences between morphology, distribution, and density of GFAP+ FS cells and S100+ FS cells were observed according to the hormone profile of pituitary adenomas. GFAP and S100 protein expression in tumour cells was significantly related to hormone profile of pituitary adenomas and also with VEGF and EGFR expression. GFAP and S100 protein expressions in tumour cells from pituitary adenomas are influenced by hormone profile. Our re-sults support the presence of two molecular subtypes of FS cells GFAP+\/VEGF+\/S100 respectively and another one that is GFAP-\/S100+\/EGFR+ simultaneously with the classical variant GFAP+\/S100+. It is possible that S100+\/EGFR+ pituitary adenomas represent a group of pituitary adenomas with an aggressive behaviour and a high ability of invasion and recurrence.

Radiological findings suggesting adrenal pathology may be caused by true adrenal tumours or by other retroperitoneal masses. Generally, the larger the tumour, the higher the possibility of adrenal cancer. Analysis of our data - 139 operations performed over 11 years (2004-2014) in patients with tumours in the adrenal area larger than 5 cm. The most common finding was adrenal cancer (25.2%), benign adenoma (24.5%), pheochromocytoma (12.9%), and metastatic cancer (10.1%). In total, there were 19 various histopathological diagnoses in this group. Although adrenal cancer is the most likely diagnosis in large adrenal tumours, a broad spectrum of various adrenal and retroperitoneal tumours with size more than 5 cm can be found in such patients. ","422":"Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is the commonest extrathyroidal feature of Graves' disease. For active, moderate to severe GO intravenous glucocorticoid pulse therapy (ivGCS) is the first-line treatment, which might be followed by oral glucocorticoid therapy. Glucocorticoid treatment, especially in the time of withdrawal, carries a risk of adrenal insufficiency. The aim of this study was to assess the pituitary-adrenal axis function in patients with GO before and at the cessation of ivGCS, and after further oral glucocorticoid therapy. Twenty patients received treatment in accordance with the EUGOGO protocol (500 mg methylprednisolone once a week for six weeks, then 250 mg once a week for another six weeks) followed by oral prednisone at a gradually decreasing dose from 30 mg\/day over a three-month period. Adrenal function was evaluated directly before the ivGCS, before the last pulse, and after oral glucocorticoid intake. The assessment consisted of clinical evaluation, and measurements of morning total serum cortisol (TSC) and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Patients with decreased cortisol level underwent ACTH stimulation test with TSC measurements before, and 30 minutes and 60 minutes after the administration of synthetic ACTH. All patients before and at the cessation of ivGCS treatment demonstrated intact adrenal function. One patient after prednisone therapy presented decreased adrenal reserve. TSC concentration was significantly lower after the ivGCS (p = 0.025) and oral glucocorticoid therapy (p = 0.0006) in comparison to evaluation before therapy. Therapy with ivGCS for GO does not lead to secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Further low-dose oral glucocorticoid therapy may result in secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in some patients.

Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is one of the genes of interest to us. Hypomethylation of a CpG site in the FTO gene was significantly associated with the risk of T2DM. The aim of the study was to find the answer to the question of whether the polymorphism changes of the FTO gene in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes are comparable in young, middle aged, and elderly people. The study involved 282 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes, who attended a primary healthcare clinic in Southern Poland. The study subjects were divided into three groups according to the age at which type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed (&gt; 40 years old, 40-60 years old, and &gt; 60 years old). The genotyping of rs9939609, rs1421085, and rs9930506 FTO polymorphisms was conducted using TaqManPre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay.

","426":"Adrenal neoplasms comprise about 10% of all tumours affecting this organ and constitute a significant, at first diagnostic and subsequently therapeutic, problem, especially since a relatively high proportion of neoplastic lesions are asymptomatic. The number of diagnosed metastases to adrenal glands is increasing. Surgical treatment involves both open surgery as well as laparoscopy. There were 245 adrenalectomies performed at our centre due to various indications over the past four years. In 27 (11.5%) cases neoplasms were diagnosed in the final histopahtological examination. In 11 (40.7%) cases primary adrenal cortex tumours were diagnosed, metastases from other solid organ tumours were identified in another 12 (44.4%) patients, and rarer neoplasms were diagnosed in the remaning 4 (14.8%) subjects. Cases of malignant pheochromocytoma were not included in this report. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in 23 (85.2%) subjects, while the ramaining 4 (12.9%) patients were subject to open adrenalectomy (conversion to open procedure in one case). There were no deaths or significant complications in the perioperative period. Comparing mean duration of open (140 minutes) and laparoscopic (190 minutes) procedures yielded a statistically significant difference (p = 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference found in the duration of operation with regard to laparoscopic adrenalectomies of tumours less than 50 mm and over 55 mm in diameter (p = 0.16). Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a safe and effective method of treatment of adrenal tumours. Its oncological completeness is comparable (to open surgery) when performed by experienced surgical teams. Laparoscopy is the reason for the smooth postoperative course observed in most patients.

The study group consisted of 131 patients with hormonally inactive adrenal incidentalomas. In each patient, besides hormonal and radiological evaluation, was assessed for fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in all participants without previous history of glucose disturbances. The HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and TyG indices were calculated. Diabetes was diagnosed in 30.5% of the studied group. Among glucose tolerance abnormalities, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was found in 23.7%, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in 4.6%, and combined IFG and IGT in 11.5%. Normoglycaemia was recognised in 29.8% of NFAIs patients. The occurrence rate of glucose aberrations increased with age. There was a significant difference in all insulin resistance indices shown between normoglycaemic patients and those with impairments in glucose tolerance. There was no significant correlation between fasting glucose, insulin resistance indices, and adrenal tumour size or degree of cortisol secretion. The prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose among NFAIs patients is much higher than in the general population. Therefore, patients with incidentally discovered adrenal tumours should be tested for glucose tolerance.

Periodic measurement of biochemical markers of MTC remains a crucial part of patient follow-up and disease monitoring. The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic value of four selected markers - calcitonin (Ct), procalcitonin (PCT), chromogranin A (CgA), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Patients with histopathologically confirmed MTC hospitalised in a single department between January 2015 and December 2015 were included in the study. Patients were subdivided into two groups: a remission group and an active disease group, based upon serum markers of MTC and imaging. Levels of Ct, PCT, CgA, and CEA were compared between the groups. Forty-four patients were included; 20 patients presented active disease and 24 were in remission. All patients with active disease had Ct exceeding the upper limit of normal range (10 pg\/mL) - for that threshold the sensitivity was 100.0% and the specificity was 73.9%; for the best-fit threshold of 121.0 pg\/mL the specificity was 95.8% with sensitivity 100.0%. There was significant correlation between Ct and PCT - p &lt; 0.000001, r = 0.93. All patients with active disease exceeded the upper limit of the normal range (0.5 ng\/mL) - for that threshold the sensitivity was 100.0% and the specificity was 83.3%; for the best-fit threshold of 0.95 ng\/mL the specificity was 95.8% with sensitivity 100.0%. In case of CEA for the best-fit threshold of 12.66 ng\/mL the specificity was 100.0% with sensitivity 57.9%; for CgA the best-fit threshold was 75.66 ng\/mL with specificity 83.3% and sensitivity 75.0%. Our study confirms that PCT can be considered as an equivalent alternative for measurement of calcitonin. On the other hand, it is also worth noting that MTC can be a rare cause of very high levels of PTC not resulting from infectious diseases. The diagnostic value of CEA and chromogranin A is much lower and can be within the normal range even in patients with advanced, metastatic MTC. They should be used only as accessory markers. ","430":"Surgery remains the most effective treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy (MIRP) is a common technique for detecting and excising abnormal parathyroid glands. The aim of this study was to compare injections of low-dose and high-dose (99m) Tc methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) for intraoperative localisation of parathyroid adenomas by means of a gamma probe in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Thirty patients with PHPT and a preoperative diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma were enrolled between 2010 and 2012. They were considered as Group B and underwent MIRP using 5 mCi Tc-99m MIBI, and their perioperative data were compared with twenty patients treated with conventional 20 mCi Tc-99m MIBI previously (Group A). Group A was made up of 20 patients (mean age, 41.55 years; 14 women and 6 men), and group B included 30 patients (mean age, 40.43 years; 19 women and 11 men). The mean serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium values were recorded pre- and postoperatively. The mean follow-up period for the patients in the two groups was 18.4 and 16.5 months, respectively. Pre-operative evaluation demonstrated that the groups were statistically similar. Intraoperative data and success rate of surgery showed no difference between the two groups. No significant complication was detected after surgeries and no recurrence happened in either of the two groups during the follow-up period. A new protocol of MIRP using low doses of Tc-99m-MIBI resulted in an excellent success rate. Comparing results of the study, we conclude that low-dose Tc-99m-MIBI may be preferred for identification of parathyroid adenomas intraoperatively by means of a gamma probe in PHPT patients because it appears to be as effective as high-dose Tc-99m-MIBI.

There is a growing body of evidence supporting the thesis that the NENs of the rectum and the NENs of the colon are two different diseases. Rectal NENs are usually small lesions, of low to moderate histological malignancy, associated with good prognosis, and most may be treated endoscopically. NENs of the colon, however, are often aggressive, poorly differentiated, associated with a poor or uncer-tain prognosis, and require surgical treatment. The management guidelines regarding these groups of patients are constantly changing. On the basis of the recent literature data and conclusions reached by the working meeting of the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumours (December 2016), this study completes and updates the data and management guidelines regarding colorectal NENs published in Endokrynologia Polska 2013; 64: 358-368.","432":"This study presents the revised Polish guidelines regarding the management of patients suffering from neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of the small intestine and appendix. The small intestine, especially the ileum, is the most common location for these neoplasms. Most are well differentiated and slow growing. Their symptoms may be atypical, which can result in delayed or accidental diagnosis. Appendicitis is usually the first manifestation of NEN in this location. Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome occur in approximately 20-30% of patients suffering from small intestinal NENs with distant metastases. The main cause of death in patients with carcinoid syndrome is carcinoid heart disease. The most useful laboratory test is the determination of chromogranin A, while concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is helpful in the diagnostics of carcinoid syndrome. For visualisation, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, colonoscopy, video capsule endoscopy, double-balloon enteroscopy, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy may be used. A detailed his-tological report is crucial for the proper diagnostics and therapy of NENs of the small intestine and appendix. The treatment of choice is surgical management, either radical or palliative. The pharmacological treatment of the hormonally active and non-active small intestinal NENs as well as NENs of the appendix is based on long-acting somatostatin analogues. In patients with generalised NENs of the small intestine in progress during the SSA treatment, with good expression of somatostatin receptors, the first-line treatment should be radio-isotope therapy, while targeted therapies, such as everolimus, should be considered afterwards. When the above therapies are exhausted, in certain cases chemotherapy may be considered.","433":"This article presents updated diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for the management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNEN), proposed by the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumours.

Biochemical and imaging (anatomical and functional) tests are of great importance in diagnostics, as well as histopathological diagnosis to determine the management of PNEN patients, but they must be confirmed by an immunohistochemical examination. PNEN therapy requires collaboration among the members a multidisciplinary team of specialists experienced in the management of these neoplasms. Surgery is the basic form of treatment in many cases.

In the present study, we revised this linkage by investigating leukocyte IL6 expression and its associations with clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed by the Polish Diabetes Association (PDA) 2011 and 2014 criteria. A total of 145 pregnant women underwent 75 g two-hour OGTT, and GDM was diagnosed according to PDA 2011 criteria (GDM\/PDA 2011 group; n = 113) and PDA 2014 criteria (GDM\/PDA 2014 group; n = 104). IL6 gene expression was investigated in leukocytes of all participants by using real-time PCR method. Compared to respective NGT control groups, the GDM\/PDA 2011 group exhibited higher FPG, two-hour OGTT, HbA1C and IL6 expression and lower HDL-C, whereas the GDM\/PDA 2014 group had higher FPG, one-hour and two-hour OGTT, HbA1C and HOMA-IR, lower QUICKI-IS, and unchanged IL6 expression. No differences in metabolic parameters and IL6 expression were found between the two GDM groups. Compared to the NGT\/PDA 2011 group, the NGT\/PDA 2014 group had lower one-hour and higher two-hour OGTT and increased IL6 expression. With PDA 2014 criteria, IL6 expression correlated positively with two-hour OGTT in both NGT and GDM groups as well as with LDL-C in NGT group, and negatively with HDL-C in NGT group. With PDA 2011 criteria, no associations were evident in NGT and GDM groups. Nevertheless, significant positive correlation of IL6 mRNA with two-hour OGTT was observed in the entire study group. Differences in metabolic phenotypes as well as gene expression and correlation data between GDM and NGT groups, categorised based on PDA 2011 and 2014 criteria, are related to changes in gestational glucose tolerance status resulting from using PDA 2014 criteria. Moreover, our findings support the hypothesis that IL-6 is associated with glucose metabolism during pregnancy.

Thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of metabolism, thermogenesis, food intake, and fat oxidation. In obese children the most frequent hormonal abnormalities are slight hyperthyrotropinaemia and moderate increases in total T3 and\/or fT3 concentrations. Those abnormalities are usually considered a cause of obesity, but according to recent studies, they should actually be considered an adaptation process aimed at increasing resting energy expenditure and total energy expenditure. Those abnormalities do not require any treatment and normalise after substantial weight loss. The mechanisms of those changes are dependent on leptin, thyroid hormone resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The present paper describes the abovementioned mechanisms based on the latest research. We also present a review of some recent original studies evaluating thyroid function in overweight and obese children, including thyroid ultrasound. A thyroid ultrasound scan in obese children frequently shows increased thyroid volume, which correlates with moderately increased TSH levels and a hypoechoic pattern typical of autoimmune thyroiditis, but without antithyroid autoantibodies. Alterations of thyroid function in overweight and obese patients cause an increase in energy expenditure, which facilitates weight loss and prevents further weight gain. Therefore, normalisation of TSH and fT3 after weight loss could explain difficulties in maintaining reduced weight.

Leptin and adiponectin were measured at baseline using commercially available ELISA tests. Clinical data, routine laboratory parameters, NT-proBNP were assessed as risk factors for reaching the study endpoints: urgent heart transplantation (B), death (C), or combined endpoint death or urgent heart transplantation (D). Patient with adverse outcome had lower BMI and higher NT-proBNP concentration. Leptin was significantly elevated in group C and adiponectin was higher in groups B and D than in survived patients. Patients with leptin concentration below median or with adiponectin concentration above median were more often transplanted in three years follow-up (p = 0.029, p = 0.022, respectively). The cumulative probability of death was greater in patients with concentration of leptin above median (p = 0.024). In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses, increasing leptin and lower BMI were predictors of death. Adiponectin was associated with higher risk of heart transplantation. Both an inverse association of BMI and positive association of leptin and adiponectin with combined endpoint were discovered. Further adjustment to established risk factors abolished association between combined endpoint and BMI, and modestly attenuate with adiponectin and leptin concentration.

The mean PTH concentrations in the non-ischaemic HF group and control group were 79.5 pg\/mL and 59.6 pg\/mL, respectively (P = 0.009). Non-HF volunteers declaring higher sun exposure time had higher serum concentrations of vitamin D compared to those with lower sun exposure time (30.3 vs. 23.8 ng\/mL, P &lt; 0.05), unlike the HF patients (24.1 ng\/mL vs. 23.2 ng\/mL, P = ns). Multiple regression analysis revealed the relationship between age, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), P, and PTH as a dependent variable. PTH is significantly elevated in non-ischaemic HF patients compared to non-HF volunteers and correlates with established factors of worse prognosis, including age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum concentrations of creatinine, and NT-proBNP.

A 55-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Mikulicz's disease. He was treated with oral steroids for six months with complete resolution. After two years the patient presented with fatigue, generalised weakness, and weight loss of 11 kg over six months. On evaluation he was found to have panhypopituitarism. MRI pituitary revealed homogeneously enlarged, well enhancing pituitary with thickening of the stalk. Serum IgG4 levels were significantly elevated. The patient was treated with methyl prednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral steroids for three months. He developed diabetes insipidus after starting steroid therapy. There was a significant resolution in the enlargement of the pituitary and stalk thickening at three months. The clinical, biochemical, and radiological findings of hypophysitis associated with Mikulicz's disease are presented with a brief review of literature. IgG4-related diseases are rare and have recently been recognised as a cause of hypophysitis. They can have multiorgan involvement.

Girls with AN exhibited significant reduction in body weight, BMI, and Cole index as well as a significant increase in serum level of vaspin compared to healthy participants. These changes were associated with a significant decrease in serum OC and CTx levels and a significant increase in OPG and sRANKL, while the OPG\/sRANKL ratio was significantly decreased. BMI and Cole index correlated negatively and significantly with CTx levels in the control group (C), girls with AN, and all study participants (C+AN). Girls with AN showed a significant negative correlation between BMI, the Cole index, and OPG levels. The combination group (C+AN) showed a significant positive correlation between BMI, Cole index, and the OPG\/sRANKL ratio. In this group of girls vaspin levels correlated positively and significantly with sRANKL and negatively with body weight, BMI, Cole index, and OPG\/sRANKL ratio. Girls with AN showed a significant negative correlation between vaspin levels and the OPG\/sRANKL ratio. Undernourishment and associated deficit of adipose tissue may result in inadequate vaspin production and bone metabolism disorders in girls with AN. Vaspin acts as a coordinator of the dynamic balance between bone formation and resorption processes; its action is affected by the cytokines of the RANKL\/RANK\/OPG system.

One-month-old male C57BL\/6J mice were fed with control (C group) and HFSC (T group) feed (n = 30 each) respectively for five months. The glucose tolerance was studied by Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) whereas serum insulin and leptin were quantified using ELISA kits, and serum cortisol was quantified using CLIA kits. Insulin resistance index and HOMA-IR levels were higher in the mice of group T as compared to age-matched mice of group C within one month and significantly higher after and five months of feeding. The total area under the glucose tolerance test curve (AUC) and the insulin curve (AUC ins) was found to significantly increase in the mice of T group as compared to the mice of C group as early as two months of feeding and was elevated after 5 months post feeding.

Samples obtained with different biopsy techniques had different proportions of contents. The proportionally low content of epithelial cells in CNAB can result in underestimated expression of molecular markers of malignancy. Consequently, the risk of malignancy or unfavourable prognosis can also be underestimated.

Cortisol excess may be endogenous or exogenous. The most common cause of CS is glucocorticoid therapy with supraphysiological (higher than in the case of substitution) doses used in various diseases (e.g. autoimmune). One possible CS cause is ectopic (extra-pituitary) ACTH secretion (EAS) by benign or malignant tumours. Since its first description in 1963, EAS aetiology has changed, i.e. as well as small cell lung cancer (SCLC), higher incidence in other malignancies has been reported. Ectopic ACTH secretion symptoms are usually similar to hypercortisolism symptoms due to other causes. A clinical suspicion of CS requires laboratory investigations. There is no single and specific laboratory test for making a CS diagnosis, and therefore multiple dynamic tests should be ordered. A combination of multiple laboratory noninvasive and invasive tests gives 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity for EAS diagnosis.

For many transsexual people, especially of the MTF (male to female) type, who have undergone hormonal and surgical sex change, the voice still presents a major problem, causing difficulties in everyday life. Hormonal treatment does not influence feminisation of the larynx. In the described MTF case, the patient's low androphonic voice was perceived as a male voice.

The current therapeutic options (surgical resection, followed by adjuvant mitotane treatment +\/- chemotherapy) are limited, and the results remain unsatisfactory. Key molecular events that contribute to formation of adrenocortical cancer are IGF2 overexpression, TP53-inactivating mutations, and constitutive activation of the Wnt\/b-catenin signalling pathway via activating mutations of the b-catenin gene. The underlying genetic causes of inherited tumour syndromes have provided insights into molecular pathogenesis. The increased occurrence of adrenocortical tumours in Li-Fraumeni and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes, and Carney complex, has highlighted the roles of specific susceptibility genes: TP53, IGF2, and PRKAR1A, respectively.

Additionally, higher transcriptional activity of TGFb1 gene in PTC in comparison with benign tissues (NG, GD) and lower expression of mRNA TGFbRII (than in TNG, GD) and mRNA TGFbetaRIII than in all studied benign tissues (NG, TNG, GD) suggests a pathogenetic importance of this cytokine and its receptors in PTC development. In GD tissue, higher transcriptional activity of TGFbetaRII and TGFbetaRIII genes as compared to other pathological tissues was observed, indicating a participation of the receptors in the pathomechanism of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). TGFbeta1 blood concentrations do not reflect pathological processes taking place in thyroid gland. (Endokrynol Pol 2016; 67 (4): 375-382).

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) accounts for 80% of all TCs and usually is related to a very good prognosis. However, the standard therapeutic approaches are not always sufficient and disease progression is sometimes observed. These data highlight the limitation of our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and how they vary between individual patients. Over the last 19 years mouse models of thyroid cancers have been developed in order to give answers to questions about their genetic background, relations of key molecular events with pathways fundamental for cancer, and many others. Among these models genetically engineered mice were of utmost importance regarding the input of knowledge about human tumorigenesis. In the present review the most significant mouse models of PTC are described with particular emphasis on BRAFV600E-induced ones, for the sake of its frequency in PTC, relation to factors of poor prognosis, and the fact that, since its identification, it became an attractive target in novel therapies. For the presented mouse models phenotype consequences of particular genetic alterations are described as well as the limitations of the used methods.","478":"A wide use of imaging techniques results in more frequent diagnosis of adrenal incidenataloma. To analyse the current state of knowledge on adrenal incidentaloma in adults in order to prepare practical management recommendations. Following a discussion, the Polish Society of Endocrinology expert working group have analysed the available data and summarised the analysis results in the form of recommendations. Unenhanced adrenal computed tomography (CT) may be recommended as an initial assessment examination helpful in the differentiation between adenomas and \"non-adenomatous\" lesions. In the case of density &gt; 10 Hounsfield units, CT with contrast medium washout assessment or MRI are recommended. However, in all patients with adrenal incidentaloma, hormonal assessment is recommended in order to exclude pheochromocytoma and hypercortisolism, notwithstanding the clinical picture or concomitant diseases. In addition, examination to exclude primary hyperaldosteronism is suggested in patients with diagnosed hypertension or hypokalaemia. Surgical treatment should be recommended in patients with adrenal incidentaloma, where imaging examinations suggest a malignant lesion (oncological indication) or with confirmed hormonal activity (endocrinological indication). The basis of the surgical treatment is laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Patients with suspected pheochromocytoma must be pharmacologically prepared prior to surgery. In patients not qualified for surgery, control examinations (imaging and laboratory tests) should be established individually, taking into consideration such features as the size, image, and growth dynamics of the tumour, clinical symptoms, hormonal tests results, and concomitant diseases.

Until now, there have been only 30 cases of FTC liver metastases described in the literature. Herein, we review publications and describe diagnostic tools that may be used in the diagnosis and follow-up of FTC metastases to the liver, including biopsy and imaging techniques like US, CT, MRI, SPECT, PET, and radioiodine scintigraphy. We also present and discuss current methods of treatment, e.g. TSH suppressive therapy with levothyroxine, surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial embolisation (TAE), liver transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin, treatment with Indium- 111-octreotide (or its analogues), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib).

In a group of 137 type 2 diabetes patients, the mean of the last three urinary microalbumin\/creatinine ratios and galectin-3 levels were evaluated. The patient group was divided into three subgroups according to their level of albuminuria calculated with urine microalbumin\/creatinine ratio. There was no significant difference between the galectin values of the three subgroups. Significant differences were observed between GFR results of group 1 vs. 3 (p &lt; 0.0001) and group 2 vs. 3 (p = 0.0006), and serum creatinine results of group 1 vs. 3 (p = 0.0003) and group 2 vs. 3 (p &lt; 0.0001). The three subgroups did not reveal any significant difference concerning the age, BMI, duration of DM, FPG, and HbA1c levels.

","483":"Melatonin exerts its biological role acting mainly via G protein-coupled membrane MT1 and MT2 receptors. To determine whether a response of oxytocinergic neurons to different concentrations of melatonin is mediated through membrane MT1 and\/or MT2 receptors, the effect of melatonin receptors antagonists, i.e. luzindole (a non-selective antagonist of both MT1 and MT2 receptors) and 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin (4-P-PDOT - a selective antagonist of MT2 receptor), on melatonin-dependent oxytocin (OT) secretion from the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial (H-N) system, has been studied both in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro experiment, male rats served as donors of the H-N explants, which were placed in 1 ml of normal Krebs-Ringer fluid (nKRF) heated to 37oC. The H-N explants were incubated successively in nKRF {fluid B1} and incubation fluid as B1 enriched with appropriate concentration of melatonin, i.e. 10-9 M, 10-7 M, or 10-3 M and luzindole or 4-P-PDOT, or their vehicles (0.1% ethanol or DMSO) {fluid B2}. After 20 minutes of incubation in fluid B1 and then B2, the media were collected and immediately frozen before OT estimation by the RIA. The OT secretion was determined by using the B2\/B1 ratio for each H-N explant. During in vivo experiment, rats were given an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of 5 mL luzindole or 4-P-PDOT, or their solvent (0.1% DMSO) and 10 minutes later the next i.c.v. infusion of 5 mL of either melatonin solution (10-7 M) or its vehicle (0.1 % ethanol in 0.9% sodium chloride). Melatonin at a concentration of 10-3 M significantly stimulated, while at a concentration of 10-9 M had no effect on, oxytocin secretion from the rat H-N system in vitro, also when luzindole or 4-P-PDOT was present in a medium. On the other hand, melatonin at a concentration of 10-7 M diminished this neurohormone output from an isolated H-N system and into the blood. Luzindole significantly suppressed such melatonin action, while 4-P-PDOT did not change the inhibitory influence of 10-7 M melatonin on oxytocin release, both in vitro and in vivo. The present study demonstrates that an inhibitory effect of 10-7 M melatonin on oxytocin secretion from the rat H-N system is mediated through a subtype MT1 membrane receptor and its action is independent of subtype MT2 receptor. However, for the stimulatory effect of pharmacological concentration (10-3 M) of the pineal hormone on oxytocin release, probably mechanisms other than membrane MT1\/MT2 receptor(s)-dependent are involved.

Forty patients with CD and forty healthy age- and sex-matched subjects were included. We assessed ACTH, urinary and serum cortisol, and fibrinogen and D-dimer levels before TSS and during follow-up. Baseline BMI (P &lt; 0.001), fibrinogen (P = 0.002), and D-dimer (P = 0.001) levels in CD patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls.

Nonparametric Spearman correlation was used to analyse the relation between thyroid hormones and body composition as well as their respective changes. In hypothyroid patients applied treatment significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) total body weight, mainly due to a decrease in fat mass, whereas in hyperthyroid patients it caused a weight gain, with a simultaneous increase in muscle, water and fat mass. Total body weight and fat mass were significantly correlated with thyroid hormones' concentrations in all patients. Changes of fat, water, or muscle mass were strongly correlated with the changes in the patients' hormonal status.

A focus on the surgical approach to the primary thyroid tumour and the regional lymphatics in addition to the interplay between surgical decision making and the use of radioactive iodine are presented to allow the reader to determine whether they are now overtreating patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer.","508":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is an autosomal dominant genetic syndrome caused by germline mutation in RET proto-oncogene. The most common mutations are in a cysteine rich domain. Phaeochromocytoma will develop in approximately 50% of RET proto-oncogene carriers. The studied population consisted of 228 RET proto-oncogene mutation carriers. Monitoring for the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma was carried out in all patients with established genetic status. Mean time of follow up was 138 months. Surveillance consisted of periodically performed clinical evaluation, 24-hour urinary determinations of total metanephrines complementary with imaging (CT, MR, MIBG scintigraphy). Phaeochromocytoma developed in 41 patients (18% of all RET proto-oncogene mutations carriers). The mean age of diagnosis for the whole cohort was 43 years. In eight cases phaeochromocytoma was the first manifestation of the MEN 2 syndrome. Only eight (20%) patients were symptomatic at diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. The mean size of the tumour was 4.3 cm. There was no extra-adrenal localisation. We observed one case of malignant phaeochromocytoma. In patients with MEN 2 syndrome phaeochromocytomas are usually benign adrenal tumours with high risk of bilateral development. Taking to account the latter risk and non-specific clinical manifestation of the neoplasm it is mandatory to screen all RET proto-oncogene mutations carriers for phaeochromocytoma. ","509":"The relationship between Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and thyroid cancer (TC) is controversial. While most surgical studies report a high incidence of malignancy among patients with HT, cytological studies do not. The role of autoantibodies in the incidence of malignancy is unclear. A single-centre retrospective observational study was conducted in patients evaluated for thyroid nodules by US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and, if indicated, by surgery. The levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid antibodies were measured at the time of FNAC. Of 4947 patients, 599 (12.1%) were diagnosed with HT. A malignant\/suspicious cytological result was found in 14.2% of the patients with HT and in 15.2% of the others. The odds ratio (OR) for malignancy in HT was 0.921 (0.716-1.183, p = 0.51). Of 1603 patients who underwent surgery, differentiated thyroid carcinoma was found in 29.5% of the HT patients and in 15.2% of the others (OR 2.33, 95% confidence interval CI, 1.403-3.854, p &lt; 0,001). Low TSH (&lt; 0.4 mIU\/L) decreased the malignancy rate in the entire patient population, both when considering the cytological results and the surgical results. This was not confirmed in the subgroup diagnosed with HT. No relationship was observed between autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (ATP) or thyroglobulin (ATG) and malignancy rate. No association between HT and thyroid cancer was observed cytologically; a positive relationship in histological series was caused by selection bias. Low TSH levels decreased the risk of TC in patients with nodular goitre, but this has not been proven in patients with HT. ","510":"Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is regarded as the gold standard method for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, but it has its limitations. Additional methods that would improve sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer (TC), especially in indeterminate lesions. Molecular tests seem to be such a tool. BRAF V600E mutation (the most common in TC) can be detected in FNAB and can be potentially a very useful ancillary marker for FNAB practice. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of the detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in FNAC in the early diagnosis of TC in patients with indeterminate cytology. 2290 FNAB were performed and 147 indeterminate results (group 3, 4, and 5 of the Bethesda system) were obtained. Material from these groups was submitted for molecular tests for the occurrence of BRAF V600E mutation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the tests were calculated. Determining the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in FNAC material in groups 3 and 4 together and in group 5 is associated with sensitivity of TC diagnosis of 37.5% and 81.8%, respectively. In all cases the detection of BRAF V600E mutation was associated with histopathologically proving the presence of TC (specificity of the test - 100%). The presence of BRAF V600E mutation in FNAC material is always associated with the presence of TC. The usefulness of determining the presence of BRAF V600E in FNAC in cytological groups 3 and 4 is associated with low sensitivity in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Due to its high specificity BRAF V600E study may be useful in determining the scope of surgery in patients in cytological group 5. ","511":"Nodular thyroid disease is one of the most frequently diagnosed pathologies of the adult population in iodine-deficient regions. Approximately 30% of thyroid aspirates are classified as nondiagnostic\/unsatisfactory or indeterminate. However, patients with indeterminate cytology still undergo surgery. The object of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of re-examining the BRAF V600E mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma patients. All patients underwent ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration of a thyroid nodule. They were assigned to one of the four groups (indeterminate or positive for malignant cells) of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology. Genetic investigation of the BRAF V600E mutation was performed for all of the fine-needle aspiration cytology specimens. All of the patients underwent surgery. Subsequently, histological investigation of the removed tissues was performed. Additional analysis of the BRAF V600E mutation from the histology specimen was then performed for the initially BRAF-negative cases. Two hundred and fourteen patients were involved in the study. One hundred and six (49.53%) patients were diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Of these 106 patients, 95 (89.62%) patients were diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. The BRAF V600E mutation was positive in 62 (65.26%) and negative in 33 (34.74%) histologically confirmed papillary thyroid cancer cases. After the genetic investigation, a total of 74 (77.89%) papillary thyroid cancer cases were positive for the BRAF V600E mutation and 21 (22.11%) were negative. Repeated examination of the BRAF V600E mutation status in the fine-needle aspiration may potentially increase the sensitivity of papillary thyroid cancer diagnostics. ","512":"The diagnostic category of follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS) was intended to allow selection of cases with low risk of malignancy from all smears with indeterminate, suspicious cytology (ISC), which can potentially take advantage from repeat fine-needle aspiration (rFNA). Aim of the study was a comparison of the risk of malignancy related to FLUS nodules and other nodules with ISC: suspected follicular neoplasm (SFN) and suspected malignancy (SM), as well as analysis of the usefulness of assessing ultrasonographic malignancy risk features (UMRF) in nodules with ISC. We analysed UMRF, rFNA, and results of histopathological examination (H) in 441 FLUS, 135 SFN, and 72 SM nodules. The frequency of exposing cancer in H in FLUS nodules was 5.9%, and when cytological follow up was also included it was 2.9%. rFNAs made the diagnosis more precise in 72.7% of FLUS, and in 5.2% it was diagnosis\/suspicion of cancer. The incidence of cancer in SFN nodules was 8.2%, in SM nodules with suspicion of papillary cancer - 61.1%, and in nodules with suspicion of other or unspecified malignancy - 53.8% (p &lt; 0.0001 FLUS vs. both groups). The presence of calcifications is the only independent UMRF for nodules with ISC (OR 4.7). Features of importance are also microcalcifications (OR 3.8), especially in the SM group, and taller-than-wide-shape (OR 2.2). FLUS and SFN nodules are characterised by particularly low value of assessing suspicious margins; analysis of hypoechogenicity is of low value in SFN nodules, like suspected vascularisation in SFN and SM nodules. The risk of cancer in FLUS and SFN nodules is lower than in SM nodules. rFNAs of FLUS nodules make the diagnosis more precise in more than 70% of cases and are effective in revealing cancers. UMRFs present variable diagnostic value depending on the subcategory of ISC. ","513":"Cytological material obtained from Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) does not permit us to distinguish between follicular carcinomas, adenomas, and hyperplastic nodules. The limitations of the method are: lack of possibility to assess the presence of tumour capsule, eventual capsular invasion, and angioinvasion. An unequivocal conclusion of whether what we have to deal with is a neoplastic or benign lesion is possible only after histopathological examination. The aim of the study was to confirm justification for using the term \"Suspicious for Follicular Neoplasm\" (SFN) in cytological diagnostics of thyroid carcinoma. Three hundred and fifty-two primary SFN FNAB diagnoses (diagnostic category IV [DC IV] - according to Bethesda System) obtained from 2010 to 2015 in the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice were analysed, and their correlation with histopathological diagnoses was verified. In the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, 352 primary SFN diagnoses (diagnostic category IV [DC IV] - according to Bethesda System) were established. Surgical treatment was undertaken after first FNAB in six cases, giving confirmation of a neoplasm in five cases, one of which was a follicular carcinoma. Second FNAB performed in 90 patients confirmed DC IV diagnosis in 53 cases. Third FNAB concerned 26 patients, providing another 14 diagnoses of DC IV. 26 out of 352 patients were subjected to surgery, and then histopathological examination confirmed a neoplasm in 19 cases (which comprises 73%), five of which were carcinomas. High positive predictive value PPV = 73% of SFN diagnosis justifies undertaking surgical treatment in any case of this diagnosis. ","514":"Follicular Lesion of Undetermined Significance (FLUS) belongs to the most controversial category of the Bethesda System. The aim of the study was to specify the risk of malignancy in patients with FLUS diagnosis in the material from the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice. This is the first Polish study specifying the risk of malignant neoplasm presence when Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) results in a report of diagnostic category III (DC III). Three hundred and ninety-five primary DC III diagnoses from FNABs of the thyroid gland performed from 2010 to 2015 were analysed. Correspondence of DC III with diagnoses from repeated FNABs and histopathology reports was evaluated. From 395 DC III patients, 27 were treated surgically for clinical indications, receiving six diagnoses of cancer. Repeat FNAB was performed in 180 cases, and primary diagnosis was confirmed in 41 cases. In the second FNAB there was one diagnosis of \"Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma\" and one \"Suspicious for Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma\". From eight patients treated surgically in these series prior cytological cancer diagnosis was confirmed in two cases. Forty-six patients were subjected to third and subsequent FNABs; in one case the diagnosis was \"Suspicious for Malignancy\". In the analysed material the risk of cancer in patients with FLUS is 2.78%. Taking into account all 56 subsequent FNABs in which the primary diagnosis was confirmed, the risk decreases to 2.43%. The diagnosis of FLUS in the absence of clinical indications is not a basis for surgical treatment. ","515":"Adequate postoperative risk assessment currently constitutes the principle of DTC treatment and further management. The aim of the study - a retrospective assessment of risk factors influencing DTC relapse. The study group consisted of 510 DTC staged pT1b-T4N0-N1M0, in whom total thyroidectomy and complementary radioiodine (RAI) treatment were carried out. In 71% papillary thyroid cancer was diagnosed, whereas in the remaining 29% - follicular thyroid carcinoma. Based on TNM classification from 1997, T1 feature was diagnosed in 11.6%, T2 in 35.1%, T3 in 8.4%, T4 in 9,4%, while in 35.5% - Tx. Lymph node metastases were present in 24.7% of cases. Median follow-up was 12.1 years (1.5-15.2). Age at DTC diagnosis, tumour diameter (T), lymph node metastases (N1), stimulated thyroglobulin, and RAI uptake in thyroid bed at qualification for RAI ablation significantly influenced freedom from progression time (FFP) in a multivariate analysis. When postoperative stimulated Tg was &gt; 30 ng\/mL the risk of relapse increased nearly six-fold, whereas the presence of N1 feature - four-fold. The total risk of relapse in the whole group was 12.55% while median FFP was 154.8 months. Five-year and 10-year FFP was 90.1% and 87.5%, respectively. Postoperative stimulated thyroglobulin level was the most potent, independent risk factor influencing FFP in DTC patients. Age above 60 years, an initial DTC stage (T and N features), and low RAI uptake in thyroid bed ( &lt; 1%) were related to a higher risk of DTC relapse, whereas the investigated histopathological features were insignificant. ","516":"Amyloid deposition in the pituitary gland is a rare localised form of amyloidosis, and most commonly reported with prolactinoma. Macular amyloidosis is a rare form of localised cutaneous amyloidosis of obscure aetiology. In contrast to most localised amyloidosis, the precursor protein(s) of both macular amyloidosis and prolactinoma are unknown. A 35-year-old man with chronic headache (six years), blurring of vision (three years), and hyperpigmented macular lesion involving arms, legs, and back (two years) was diagnosed to have hyperprolactinaemia (8927 ng\/mL) and secondary adrenal insufficiency. MRI revealed pituitary macroadenoma compressing the optic chiasma, encasing the right carotid artery and extending into the sphenoid sinus. A biopsy of skin from the right upper arm revealed thickened stratum corneum, acanthosis, and deposition of pale eosinophilic material in papillary dermis that gave a rose pink colour under methyl-violet and appeared congophilic with Congo red stain, which under polarised light showed green birefringence, diagnostic of macular amyloidosis. Headache, bitemporal haemianopia, and skin lesion improved following cabergoline therapy. Temporal profile of the disease characterised by symptoms of macroprolactinoma preceding onset of macular amyloidosis with resolution of symptoms of macroprolactinoma, accompanied by reductions in prolactin, and concomitant improvement in macular amyloidosis with cabergoline therapy may suggest some link between macroprolactinoma and macular amyloidosis. This report intends to highlight this novel association of macular amyloidosis and macroprolactinoma.","517":"According to current diagnostic criteria, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is effective as a diagnosis of exclusion. Here, we present a case of a 31-year-old woman with a history of oligomenorrhoea and hirsutism, who, despite a \"muscular\" appearance and a normal body mass index (22.27 kg\/m2), was found to have an extreme insulin resistance and diabetes accompanied by hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. An autoimmune screen for possible latent autoimmune diabetes in adults was negative. She was subsequently found to have familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD2, OMIM #151660) caused by an R482Q mutation in the LMNA gene encoding lamin A\/C. This mutation results in arginine to glutamine substitution at the protein level, while phenotypically this condition presents with a loss of body fat, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and other features mimicking PCOS. Interestingly her mother, with a history of myocardial infarction and diabetes at the age of 46 but no oligomenorrhoea, was also found to harbour the same mutation (LMNA R482Q). Our case highlights the importance of assessment of adipose tissue distribution, as well as a significance of assessment of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in the differential diagnosis of PCOS. Furthermore, patients with atypical adipose tissue distribution should be referred for formal genetic testing. ","518":"The discovery of kisspeptins in the recent past remoulded current understanding of the neuroendocrine axis relating to the regulation of human puberty and reproduction. Kisspeptins have been recognised to act upstream of GnRH and have been shown to play a vital role in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis via regulation of gonadotrophin secretion, onset of puberty, and control of fertility. KNDy (kisspeptin\/neurokinin-B\/dynorphin) neurons have been suggested to modulate GnRH pulsatile secretion, which is required to support reproductive function in both sexes. They have also been involved in mediating both positive and negative sex steroid feedback signals to GnRH neurons and serve as a vital connection between reproduction and metabolic status of the body. When kisspeptin is administered to healthy humans, and in patients with reproductive disorders, it strongly and directly stimulates GnRH and subsequent LH secretion and enhances LH pulse frequency. These observations suggest that kisspeptins are a potential novel therapeutic approach for treating disorders with either pathologically reduced or augmented gonadotrophins pulsatile secretion and is currently a focus of translational research. Kisspeptins have also been identified in several peripheral reproductive organs, indicating their role in modulation of ovarian function, embryo implantation, and placentation, but a great deal of work remains to be done to explore further in this regard, and the evidence is only available from studies done on animal models. In this review we will mainly focus on current available evidence related to the role of kisspeptins in controlling GnRH pulse frequency, specifically their role in puberty, fertility, and reproduction. We will also be appraising other factors that regulate the kiSS1\/Kisspeptin\/GPR-54 system.","519":"L-arginine (L-arg) and vitamin C supplementation may decrease fat accumulation and have a favourable effect on carbohydrate metabolism. This is partly caused by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in adipocyte development and remodelling. Our study evaluated the effects of L-arg and vitamin C supplementation on the content of visceral fat (VF%), activity of MMPs, and insulin resistance (IR) in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The experiment was performed using 48 Wistar rats divided into four groups: Group 1 was fed a standard diet, Group 2 a HFD, Group 3 a HFD supplemented with L-arg (A), and Group 4 a HFD supplemented with L-arg and vitamin C (AC). The animals were euthanized after six weeks. The concentrations of serum glucose, insulin, MMP-2, and MMP-9, as well as IR by Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) and VF% were measured. Statistically significant increases in VF%, MMP-2, MMP-9, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels were observed in the HFD group when compared to the control group. A smaller increase in VF%, insulin, and HOMA-IR was seen in Group 3 (A) and 4 (AC). L-arg supplementation protected against increases in MMP-2 and MMP-9 in Group 3 (A) and 4 (AC). L-arginine could protect from an increase in visceral fat through a change in the activity of MMPs and amelioration of insulin sensitivity in rats fed a HFD. The addition of vitamin C did not improve the effects of L-arginine supplementation. ","520":"99mTc-sestamibi, a radiopharmaceutical widely used in the assessment of myocardial perfusion, can be used as an indicator of thyroid disease due to its oncophilic character. The aim of this study was to establish the usefulness of performing additional examinations of radiotracer uptake in the thyroid gland during standard stress scintigraphy with sestamibi in order to identify thyroid diseases. After a retrospective evaluation of 330 consecutive myocardial perfusion scintigraphies performed in our hospital during one year, 41 patients with a focal accumulation of 99mTc-sestamibi in the thyroid were enrolled in the study. The patients underwent clinical examinations, including thyroid ultrasonography and TSH, fT4, fT3, aTPO, TRAB, calcitonin, and CEA levels. Based on the thyroid ultrasounds, 21 patients were referred for fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid. An abnormal accumulation of radiotracer in the thyroid was found in 41(12.4%) of 330 patients who underwent stress cardiac scintigraphy. Thirteen (31.7%) of those patients had multinodular euthyroid goitres, 12 (29.2%) had a single thyroid nodule (including two autonomous nodules), 11 (26.8%) had autoimmune thyroid disease, and one (2.4%) had papillary thyroid carcinoma. In 12 (29.2%) with thyroid tracer uptake there was no thyroid pathology. Additional evaluation of radiotracer uptake in the thyroid during standard myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is a valuable tool in the detection of thyroid diseases. The additional or parallel evaluation of radiotracer uptake in the thyroid should be considered during every myocardial scintigraphy. ","521":"Omentin-1, secreted by visceral adipose tissue, has been indicated in the regulation of bone metabolism in girls with anorexia nervosa (AN). The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between omentin-1 and bone metabolism in girls with AN as well as the potential involvement of OPG and RANKL in this relationship. Serum omentin-1, OC, CTx, OPG, and sRANKL were determined by ELISA in 49 girls with AN and in 30 healthy controls, aged 13 to 17 years. Girls with AN exhibited significant reduction in body weight, BMI, and Cole index as well as a significant increase in serum omentin-1 levels, compared to healthy participants. These changes were associated with a significant decrease in serum OC and CTx levels and a significant increase in OPG and sRANKL while the OC\/CTx and OPG\/sRANKL ratios were significantly decreased. BMI and the Cole index correlated negatively and significantly with omentin-1 levels, positively with CTx levels and the OC\/CTx ratio in the control group (C), girls with AN, and all study participants (C + AN). Girls with AN showed a significant negative correlation between BMI, the Cole index, and OPG levels. The combined group (C + AN) showed a significant positive correlation between BMI, the Cole index, and the OPG\/sRANKL ratio. Omentin-1 levels correlated negatively and significantly with OC and CTx levels as well as with the OC\/CTx and OPG\/sRANKL ratios in the C, AN, and C + AN groups. The relationship between omentin-1, bone markers, and the OC\/CTx and OPG\/sRANKL ratios observed in girls with AN indicates the involvement of this adipokine in the regulation of dynamic balance between bone formation and resorption processes. Omentin-1 might exert a negative effect on bone remodelling in girls with AN by inhibiting both bone formation and resorption. The OPG\/sRANKL system plays an important role in the latter.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between TSH and risk of malignancy in patients with thyroid nodules. We included 622 patients with thyroid nodules evaluated by fine needle aspiration and\/or thyroidectomy and diagnosed by cytology or histology. Clinical and laboratory data, such as gender, weight, ultrasound findings, serum TSH, and free T4, were obtained from medical records or collected during each patient's first visit to our centre, prior to any intervention. Thyroid cancer was more prevalent in males (p = 0.012) and in patients with a solitary nodule (p &lt; 0.01). Malignant tumours were predominantly solid, whereas benign tumours were solid or mixed (p = 0.053). The carcinoma risk in patients with thyroid nodules increased with increasing serum TSH concentration, with a significant elevation in patients with serum TSH levels above 1.64 mU\/L (p &lt; 0.001). This relationship persisted even when the subgroup of patients undergoing thyroidectomy was analysed separately. Patients with follicular lesions presented with significantly higher TSH levels compared to patients with benign cytology (p &lt; 0.001). We also found correlation between elevated TSH and tumour size (p = 0.005). Our results suggest that in patients with nodular thyroid disease the carcinoma risk rose in parallel with serum TSH concentration, with significant increases evident in patients with serum TSH greater than 1.64 mU\/L. ","526":"Thyroid dysfunction has been recognised as playing a role in the coagulation cascade, but the clinical implications of this phenomenon are unclear. The aim of our study was to assess the predictive power of TSH measurement on the presence or absence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). From January 2009 to August 2012, all consecutive patients hospitalised for suspected VTE were included in the study. VTE was confirmed either by pulmonary angiography or compressive ultrasound. We investigated the predictive power of TSH concentration on the risk of VTE in univariate and multivariate analysis including the existing risk factors (age, D-dimer). A total of 232 patients were eligible for final analysis, with a median age of 70 years (IQR 58-80) and male-to-female ratio of 124:108. VTE was confirmed in 124 patients (53.4%). TSH concentration was significantly higher in cases with VTE (median 2.17 vs. 1.76 mIU\/L, p = 0.0104), but free T4 concentrations were not found to be significantly different. Receiver operating curve analysis identified the cut-off of TSH &gt; 2.686 mIU\/L as a predictor of VTE with the prevalence of VTE 47.1 vs. 66.7% below and above this cut-off, p = 0.011. Multivariate logistic regression identified five independent predictors of VTE: male gender (odds ratio, OR = 2.22), D-dimer &gt; 0.5 mg\/L OR = 16.42), CRP &gt; 5 g\/L (OR = 9.178), TSH &gt; 2.686 mIU\/L (OR = 2.269), and age (OR = 0.9767\/year). Among patients with suspected venous thromboembolism TSH concentration was found to be an independent predictor of VTE in addition to gender, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), and age. ","527":"Over the last 18 months we operated on six patients with large adrenal gland cysts in our centre. This consisted of 8.2% of all patients treated in said period due to adrenal gland pathologies. On ruling out malignancy or parasitic nature of the lesions, all patients were surgically treated in order to excise the cysts while leaving the gland untouched. In five patients the cysts were resected but the adrenal gland was spared. However, in one patient the adrenal gland coated the entire cystic mass, which imposed performance of adrenalectomy in addition to cystectomy. During surgeries we tried not to clip the suprarenal vein, which we managed to do in four out of six cases. A one-year remote follow-up period revealed no cyst recurrence in ultrasound or CT, and it was possible to visualise the remaining part of the adrenal gland in all cases. Thus, in our opinion resection of benign cysts is well justified and recommendable. ","528":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is a genetic disorder caused by mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. MEN 2A includes medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. The authors present a case study of three family members with bilateral pheochromocytoma in the course of MEN 2A, a catecholamine crisis being the first manifestation of the syndrome in one of them. Case 1: A 30-year-old man without a history of hypertension or any other chronic medical problems was admitted to the Emergency Department because of a hypertensive crisis that was followed by cardiac arrest. A later diagnosis revealed bilateral pheochromocytoma and RET proto-oncogene mutation in codon 634. The patient underwent bilateral adrenalectomy and total thyroidectomy; the latter confirmed the presence of medullary carcinoma. Case 2: The patient underwent right adrenalectomy with the removal of a pheochromocytoma at the age of sixteen. Ten years later, a suspicion of pheochromocytoma in the remaining left adrenal was raised. Mutation in the RET proto-oncogene was confirmed as well. The patient first underwent left adrenalectomy and then she had total thyroidectomy. Postoperative histopathological examinations revealed pheochromocytoma and medullary carcinoma. Case 3: Radiological and biochemical examination confirmed pheochromocytoma. Therefore, the two adrenals were removed. As mutation in codon 634 was detected, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy as well. The presence of medullary carcinoma was confirmed. Pheochromocytoma is a rare and potentially lethal disease if a catecholamine crisis develops. Its recognition requires further investigation towards genetic syndromes, particularly MEN 2A.

The aim of this study was to assess national efforts in the field of endocrinology and metabolism. A Web of Science search was performed using subject categories \"endocrinology &amp; metabolism\" to identify articles published from 2010 to 2014. The total and per capita numbers of articles and citations were analysed for different countries. A total of 79,394 articles were published on endocrinology and metabolism from 2010 to 2014. Most were published in North America, East Asia, and Europe. The majority (82.28%) were reported by authors in high-income countries, 17.64% were published in middle-income countries, and only 0.08% were published in low-income countries. Authors in the United States published the most articles (27.38%), followed by China (7.22%), Italy (5.70%), the United Kingdom (5.6%), and Japan (5.54%). Articles published by authors in the United States had the most citations (260,934). A positive correlation was found between the number of publications and population\/gross domestic product (GDP; p &lt; 0.01). When normalised to population size, the ranking for the most publications was Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands; when normalised to GDP, the ranking was Denmark, Greece, and the Netherlands. The majority of endocrinology and metabolism articles were published by authors from high-income countries with few from low-income countries. The United States was the most productive country. However, when population size and GDP were considered, some European countries were ranked higher. ","531":"Decompensated diabetes is a major risk factor in the development of periodontal diseases. This leads to disturbances of carbohydrates, protein, and fat and morphological changes in many organs. These changes also apply to the masticatory system, especially periodontal tissues. The aim of the study was to assess the periodontal status and periodontal treatment needs in patients with non-controlled diabetes type 1 and type 2 (HbA1c &gt; 7%), and to compare the results with the data obtained in a group of generally healthy patients. The study included 275 patients, 155 of them were patients with non-controlled diabetes during hospitalisation (study group), while 120 subjects constituted the control group of healthy people. The study excluded edentulous people. CPITN index (according to Ainamo et al.) was used to assess the periodontal state and periodontal treatment needs. The average level of glycated haemoglobin HbA1C among patients in the study group was 9.43% in women and slightly more at 9.57% in men. The periodontal status in healthy people was satisfactory, dominated by the maximum values of CPITN = 0, CPITN = 1, and CPITN = 2. The study group more frequently revealed the maximum values of CPITN = 3 and CPITN = 4. This shows the more advanced periodontal changes in this group. Due to the bad condition of the periodontium, the periodontal treatment needs proved to be far greater in the study group and related primarily to comprehensive specialist treatment (TN3). Decompensated diabetes may be an important cause of changes in periodontal tissues and may cause a significant loss of masticatory function in patients. ","532":"The purpose of the study was to assess the results of operative treatment of patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism (tHPT) after kidney transplantation. The study included 30 patients in whom kidney transplantation was performed between 2006 and 2013, and in whom parathyroidectomy had to be performed at a later time because of tHPT. There were 17 (56.7%) women and 13 (43,3%) men in the group, aged 18-64, mean 46.1 years. In order to locate the lesion before the operation, all patients had to undergo USG, and 14 had scintigraphy MIBI in addition. Serum levels of PTH, ionised calcium, and creatinine were determined together with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The results of control tests were compared with those performed one day before parathyroidectomy (PTX) and three days after the operation. Among 30 patients, 19 (63.3%) underwent total resection of three parathyroid glands and 3\/4 of the fourth. Two parathyroid glands were resected in eight (26.7%) patients, and one in the remaining three (10%) patients. Histopathological examination showed one parathyroid adenoma in six (20%) patients, and one parathyroid adenoma and hyperplasia of the remaining glands in one (3.3%) patient. Five (16.7%) patients had hyperplasia of two parathyroid glands whereas no changes were observed in two patients. On the other hand, hyperplasia of all glands was noted in 18 (60%) patients. Serum PTH level was significantly lower compared to the level before operation (p &lt; 0.001), being 5.5-58.5 pg\/mL, on day 3 postoperatively. Differences in the levels of serum-ionised calcium were also significant (p &lt; 0.0001) after eight months. Surgical resection of parathyroid glands is a management of choice in patients after kidney transplantation accompanied by hypercalcaemia lasting longer than one year. Resection of 3 3\/4 parathyroid glands because of hyperplasia in patients with hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation enables restoration of normal calcium metabolism. Moreover, resection of 3 3\/4 parathyroid glands can allow avoidance of autotransplantation, which is necessary in cases of total resection of parathyroid glands.

In children with JIA (n = 42) and healthy subjects (n = 28), leptin concentration (LEP), body mass index (BMI), haematocrit (HTC), haemoglobin (HB), morphotic elements (WBC,LYMPH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and ANA Hep-2 antibodies were analysed. JIA group was divided into: children with a longer (51-148 months) (IA) n = 22 and a shorter disease period (2-18 months) (IB) n = 20. Only 58.3% of the IA and 50% of the IB group had ANA Hep-2 confirmed. The ill children had higher and more diversified LYMPH and ESR levels compared to the healthy children. The highest LEP for the IA group was 37.5 ng\/cm3, (Me 5.85), for IB - 40.10 ng\/cm3, (Me 2.46) as compared to the IC - 3.74 ng\/cm3 (Me 2.85), respectively. The average BMI value for the IA group was 16.61 kg\/m2, for IC it was 18.91 kg\/m2, and the median for IB was 15.89 kg\/m2. Children with BMI values &lt; 23 kg\/m2 from the IA and IB group had a reduction in LEP as compared to control group (p = 0.04). The relationship between the illness and LEP diversification per BMI unit was found in both groups. Children with a shorter illness period had higher LEP differentiation per BMI unit compared to the healthy children. Children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis with BMI &lt; 23 kg\/m2 had lower leptin concentrations than healthy subjects. Ill children with a shorter-term disease had a higher diversification of leptin concentration per BMI unit as compared to healthy controls.

There are a couple of corrective surgical procedures in the case of VCP. The aim of our study was to show the possibility of widening of the glottis, and to evaluate the techniques and effects of surgical treatments due to bilateral VCP resulting from thyroid gland surgery. Five methods of surgical treatment were used: laser-assisted posterior cordectomy, according to Denis and Kashima; laser-assisted bilateral medial arytenoidectomy, as proposed by Crumley; laser-assisted posterior ventriculocordectomy, as described by Pia; laser-assisted total arytenoidectomy with posterior cordectomy, as presented by Ossoff; and laterofixation, according to Lichtenberger. The postoperative patient's subjective improvement was assessed using visual analogue scale. Between 1998 and 2014 we operated on 270 patients with bilateral VCP. Paresis occurred as the result of the iatrogenic effect of thyroid gland surgery in 255 patients (94.4%) vs. 15 (7.6%) from other causes. The majority of our patients (77.6%) had undergone laser arytenoidectomy with posterior partial cordectomy, and in 13.7% of them Lichtenberger laterofixation had been performed. Ossoff 's surgery gives good ventilation results: successful decannulation (62.9% after first surgery; 97.6% final rate) and significant subjective ventilation improvement in 96% of patients. Ossoff 's laser arytenoidectomy with posterior cordectomy is a safe procedure that gives acceptable ventilation improvement. Patients report satisfactory quality of life and the possibility of returning to active professional life. Laterofixation should be considered as an alternative for tracheotomy rather than permanent procedure.

The aim of the study was to determine BRAF T1799A mutation and KRas proto-oncogene mutation, and the analysis of RASSF1A promoter methylation level in cytological material obtained from FNAB specimens of thyroid nodules. The study population consisted of 85 women and 12 men. The study material was genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood and thyroid bioptates. Pyrosequencing was used for the evaluation of RASSF1 methylation level. KRas mutation was investigated with Sanger sequencing. BRAF mutation was analysed by standard methods of real-time amplification detection (real-time PCR) with the use of specific starters surrounding the mutated site. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between mean methylation of four CpG islands of RASSF1A gene and thyroid tumour volume and its largest diameter (p &lt; 0.05). KRas mutation was not detected in any of the 97 patients. In 7\/85 subjects (8.2%) BRAF mutation was observed. In 6\/7 patients with BRAF mutation, FNAB of thyroid nodules confirmed a benign nature of the lesions; the material was non-diagnostic in one patient, and papillary thyroid cancer was diagnosed on the basis of postoperative histopathology assessment. The results of genetic tests reported in our study indicate that the presence of BRAF mutation or higher RASSF1A methylation levels in FNAB cytology specimens of benign lesions may be useful in the assessment of oncological risk, while the evaluation of KRas proto-oncogene mutation is not a valuable test in pre-operative diagnosis of nodular goitre.

ThyPRO is a thyroid-specific quality of life (QoL) questionnaire applicable to patients with benign thyroid disorders. There is substantial evidence for its clinical validity and reliability in patients with benign thyroid disorders. Our aim was to develop a validated Polish version of this questionnaire (ThyPROpl). ThyPROpl was translated and validated according to standard methodology for translation of patient-reported outcomes (PRO). Firstly, two independent translations from English to Polish were performed by two translators native in Polish, and a consensus version was reached in collaboration with an in-country consultant. A third translator prepared a back-translation from Polish to English, which likewise was reviewed by the in-country consultant. The backwards translation was reviewed by a PRO translation expert native in English (Health Research Associates HRA) and by the developer of ThyPRO, who provided additional revisions. Finally, ThyPROpl was tested among five patients with thyroid disorders with cognitive interview techniques, and new changes and clarifications needed for its full understanding were made. ThyPROpl is a linguistically validated version of the original ThyPRO questionnaire. We recommend ThyPROpl for the evaluation of QoL among Polish patients with benign thyroid disorders. ThyPRO has now been translated into 13 languages.

As an original version we used the English version of GO-QOL, which consists of 15 questions summarised in two subscales. GO-QOLpl was translated and validated in accordance with standard principles for translation of patient-reported outcomes (PRO). GO-QOLpl is a linguistically validated version of the original GO-QOL questionnaire, which is recommended by the European Group of Graves' Orbitopathy (EUGOGO).

Although nesidioblastosis is a rare but well-recognized disorder of persistent hypoglycaemia in infants, it is extremely rare in adults.We present a case of a 59-year-old woman with small neuroendocrine tumour of the tail of the pancreas, diagnosed by CT scans and MRI, and hypoglycaemic syndrome. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed, and pathologic examination showed a well-differentiated, non-functioning endocrine tumour of the pancreas and diffuse nesidioblastosis in the remnant gland. In the early postoperative period, recurrent hypoglycaemia occurred in spite of oral diazoxide therapy. Plasma proinsulin levels were extremely high. 18F-DOPA positron emission tomography showed a pathologic uptake of tracer in the head and the uncinate process of the pancreas. Subtotal pancreatectomy was suggested but the patient refused operation: she is taking diazoxide 100 mg three times daily. Coexistence of nesidioblastosis with a neuroendocrine tumour makes preoperative diagnosis and management of severe hypoglycaemia more difficult. Nesidioblastosis should be considered in differential diagnosis of hypoglycaemic syndrome, but histological examination is necessary for a definitive tissue diagnosis.","541":null,"542":null,"543":"Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is encoded by the VDR gene. Several studies have supported that this gene is associated with diabetes. Heterodimer VDR\/RXR functions as an enhancer of the BGLAP gene and increases the basal transcription rate of osteocalcin (OC) during osteoblast differentiation. OC is a regulator of glucose metabolism in mice. Moreover, OC level is decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although inversely correlated with serum glucose insulin and glycated haemoglobin, it is unclear whether OC reduction is caused by diabetes or plays a role in the pathogenesis and\/or progression of the disease. In this study we analysed the association between TaqI and ApaI VDR gene polymorphisms and OC serum concentration in T2D subjects. Patients underwent clinical and nutritional assessment. Genomic DNA was extracted from leucocytes using a standard salting-out procedure. The polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-RFLP method. ELISA was used to measure OC and insulin concentrations. Association between TT genotype of TaqI polymorphism and low levels of OC was observed only in the population with overweight and obesity. No association between TaqI and ApaI polymorphisms and T2D was observed (p &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, in T2D subjects, no correlation between ApaI and TaqI genotypes and age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), glucose, or OC was observed.

The study aimed to establish the first clinical characteristics of Polish patients with CHI and to propose a novel clinical algorithm allowing the prioritisation of genetic and radiology studies, based on patient's characteristics and response to pharmacotherapy. Thirty-one patients with CHI were recruited from five reference centres in Poland. Clinical and biochemical parameters were statistically evaluated and compared to those of a control group (n = 30). CHI predisposes to increased birth weight (p = 0.004), lower Apgar score (p = 0.004), perinatal complications (74%), and neurological implications (48%). Diagnostic process and therapy were inconsistent. A trial of pharmacotherapy was applied in 21 patients (68%), and diagnostic imaging with 18F-L-DOPA PET was performed in only 3. Eighteen patients (58%) were surgically treated, including 8 infants (44%) aged less than 2 months. Depending on the type of resection, further hypoglycaemia was observed postoperatively in 50% (n = 9) and hyperglycaemia in 39% (n = 7) of cases.

Therapy often involves isolation and is available only in selected centres, which may be located far from some patients' places of residence, which is inconvenient for elderly people. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of outpatient fractionated 131-I treatment of patients with large nodular goitres, as well as to evaluate complications and the factors affecting treatment results. The study included 35 patients with a large nodular goitre. Thyroid volume and treatment results were evaluated using US and CT neck examination. Mean thyroid volume prior to treatment was 104.36 mL (range 36.23-301.09 mL). An average administered 131-I activity was 1806 MBq (range 800-4000). The average reduction of goitre volume was 43.18% (range -17.23-89.66%). Final treatment results correlated with the thyroid size reduction obtained three months after treatment (r = 0.74; p = 0.001). Symptoms of transient hyperthyroidism were observed in 8.57% of patients, in 5.4% Graves disease was induced (including severe Graves' orbitopathy in 2.7%), and in 2.86% TRAb increase without development of hyperthyroidism was observed. The treatment results were not influenced by initial thyroid volume (r = -0.01; p = 0.95). An increase in thyroid volume during the treatment was reported in 20% of patients, with a mean increase of 22.3% (range 0.63-55.03%). Post-treatment hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 42.9% of patients. One patient was diagnosed with salivary gland damage.

Patients were divided into eight groups according to needle size (22 vs. 27 gauge), biopsy technique (aspiration vs. capillary), and whether or not OCA was performed. Sample adequacy rates were calculated for each group and subgroups and compared using chi-square tests. When all nodes were evaluated (n = 400), the adequacy rate was significantly greater with the capillary than with the aspiration technique (97% vs. 91.5%, p = 0.032) and when OCA was than was not performed (97% vs. 91.5%, p = 0.032).

Abnormal thyroid function affects the severity of MetS components, since regulating metabolism is one of the most important functions of thyroid hormones. In this study, we present the influence of hypothyroidism on lipid and carbohydrate disorders in patients with MetS. The described study was a prospective, two-centre screening study of 24-month duration. The study participants were 441 patients (350 women, 91 men, aged 28-82) with metabolic syndrome diagnosed according to the 2005 IDF. By comparing the study and the control group, statistically significant differences were observed in the mean triglyceride levels (respectively 161,5 vs. 134,8 mg\/dL, p = 0.047), mean fasting glycaemia (respectively 111,8 vs. 126,1 mg\/dL, p = 0.044) and TG\/HDL ratio (4,74 vs. 3,71, p = 0.043). Hypothyroidism shows a positive correlation with the TG levels and TG\/HDL-C ratio and a negative correlation with the mean fasting glycaemia in people with MetS. A significantly higher TG\/HDL-C ratio and lower mean insulin sensitivity ratio observed in men with hypothyroidism, indicated higher insulin resistance in men. In view of the above, it may be hypothesized that in patients with both MetS and hypothyroidism, especially of male gender, the risk of death of cardiovascular causes is greater due to the severity of MetS components. Moreover, we suggest that in patients recently diagnosed with MetS, active detection of hypothyroidism should be performed by determining the TSH levels, while patients diagnosed with hypothyroidism (apart from replacement therapy) should be monitored for the possible occurrence of MetS in the future.

The statement is based on the alarming data about the increase of the prevalence of many endocrine disorders such as: cryptorchidism, precocious puberty in girls and boys, and hormone-dependent cancers (endometrium, breast, prostate). In our opinion, it is of human benefit to conduct epidemiological studies that will enable the estimation of the risk factors of exposure to EDCs and the probability of endocrine disorders. Increasing consumerism and the industrial boom has led to severe pollution of the environment with a corresponding negative impact on human health; thus, there is great necessity for the biomonitoring of EDCs in Poland.","551":"Hypercalcaemia during pregnancy is uncommon, and mostly associated with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT).

Untreated disease complicates foetal development and foetal death is a significant risk. Our case illustrates the difficulty in detecting pHPT during pregnancy, serious complications connected with severe hypercalcaemia, and difficulties in preparing the patient for surgical treatment.

Causes of FHA can be classified into the three groups: 1) stress-related factors, 2) consequences of weight loss and\/or underweight, and 3) consequences of physical exercise or practicing sports. Diagnosis of FHA should be based on a history of menstrual disorders. During physical examination, patients with FHA present with secondary and tertiary sex characteristics specific for the pubertal stage preceding development of the condition and with the signs of hypoestrogenism. Laboratory results determine further management of patients with amenorrhea, and thus their correct interpretation is vital for making appropriate therapeutic decisions. Treatment of chronic anovulation, menstrual disorders, and secondary amenorrhea resulting from hypothalamic disorders should be aimed at the elimination of the primary cause, i.e. a decrease in psycho-emotional strain, avoidance of chronic stressors, reduction of physical exercise level, or optimisation of BMI in patients who lose weight. If menses do not resume after a period of six months or primary causative treatment is not possible, neutralisation of hypoestrogenism consequences, especially unfavourable effects on bone metabolism, become the main issue. Previous studies have shown that oestroprogestagen therapy is useful in both the treatment of menstrual disorders and normalisation of bone mineral density.

Seven SNPs: rs3842756 (G\/A), rs3842755 (G\/T), rs3842754 (C\/T), rs3842753 (A\/C), rs3842752 (C\/T), rs3842748 (G\/C), and rs689 (T\/A) were genotyped in a portion of the population (160 cases and 95 controls) by sequencing or by SSO-PCR. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern allowed selecting three tagSNPs (rs3842754, rs3842748, and rs689), which were genotyped in the rest of the population by KASPar. Six haplotypes were reconstructed, among which three (h1, h2 and h6) were more frequent. Statistical analysis allowed observation of the association of the SNP rs3842748, through its GC genotype, with obesity in PCOS (P = 0.049; OR CI95% 1,59 [1.00-2.51]) and in classical PCOS (YPCOS) (P = 0.010), as well as the correlation of the SNP rs689 and the pair of haplotypes h1\/h1 with higher levels of testosteronaemia in the PCOS group, although this was at the limit of significance (P = 0.054) CONCLUSION: These results are in accordance with some studies in literature and highlight the role of insulin gene VNTR in complex metabolic disorders. ","561":"Amiodarone, a benzofuranic iodine-rich antiarrhythmic drug, causes thyroid dysfunction in 15-20% of cases. Amiodarone can cause both hypothyroidism (AIH, amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism) and thyrotoxicosis (AIT, amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis). AIH is treated by L-thyroxin replacement and does not need amiodarone discontinuation. There are two main forms of AIT: type 1, a form of true iodine-induced hyperthyroidism; and type 2, a drug-induced destructive thyroiditis. However, mixed\/indefinite forms exist, contributed to by both pathogenic mechanisms. Type 1 AIT usually occurs in diseased thyroid glands, whereas type 2 AIT develops in substantially normal thyroid glands. Thioamides represent the first-line treatment for type 1 AIT, but iodine-replete glands are poorly responsive; sodium\/potassium perchlorate, by inhibiting thyroidal iodine uptake, may increase the response to thioamides. Type 2 AIT is best treated by oral glucocorticoids. Response depends on thyroid volume and severity of thyrotoxicosis. Mixed\/indefinite forms may require a combination of thioamides, potassium perchlorate, and steroids. Radioiodine treatment is usually not feasible because amiodarone-related iodine load decreases thyroidal radioiodine uptake. Thyroidectomy represents an important and helpful option in cases resistant to medical therapy. Surgery performed by a skilled surgeon may represent an emergent treatment in patients who have severe cardiac dysfunction.","562":"Bruck syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome consisting of bone fragility and congenital joint contractures.

It is usually associated with a high rate of local and distant recurrence. Laboratory findings and clinical symptoms may be similar to those in parathyroid adenoma. The histological features of PC may also be non-specific and the affected gland is often indistinguishable from a benign lesion. The proper diagnosis is commonly made months to years later when the disease recurs or metastases are present. Therefore, parathyroid carcinoma still remains a diagnostic and management challenge for many physicians. However, there are some features that, in combination, may help in diagnosis. Surgery still remains the only curative treatment, even in metastatic disease. In advanced, non-operable subjects, managing hypercalcaemia and controlling a tumour are the main goals. Morbidity is caused by hypercalcaemia rather than metastases. A multidisciplinary approach with experienced endocrinologists, pathologists, radiologists, nuclear medicine doctors, oncologists, and surgeons is needed to optimize patient outcome.","564":"To evaluate, over 24 months of prospective follow-up, the dosage and costs of lanreotide AUTOGEL 120 mg (ATG120) administered as part of routine acromegaly care in Poland.

The study population consisted of adult acromegalic patients treated for at least 3 injections of ATG120. The endpoints were: percentage of patients treated with ATG120 at an extended dosing interval (&gt; 4 weeks), mean time between injections, and the cost of ATG120 during a 24-month prospective observation. Costs were calculated in PLN from the public health-care payer and patient perspective for the year 2014. 143 patients were enrolled in, and 132 completed (70% women, 81% macroadenoma, 75% previous surgery) the analysis. During two years, changes in the treatment pattern were reported in 41 patients: 17% of them had increased injection interval and 10% switched to octreotide LAR and then returned to ATG120. Sixty-three patients (48%) received ATG120 at an extended dosing interval. ATG120 was predominantly administered in an out-patient setting (84%) by a health care professional (97%). The results demonstrated that extended dosing interval of ATG120 is used in a substantial proportion of patients in routine clinical practice in Poland.

Viral infection, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is one of the most frequently considered environmental factors involved in autoimmunity. Its role in the development of AITD has not been confirmed so far. Surgical specimens of Graves' and Hashimoto's diseases and nodular goitres were included in the study. The expression of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) was analysed by immunohistochemistry, with the parallel detection of virus-encoded small nuclear non-polyadenylated RNAs (EBER) by in situ hybridisation. In none of the Graves' disease specimens but in 34.5% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis cases the cytoplasmic expression of LMP1 was detected in follicular epithelial cells and in infiltrating lymphocytes. EBER nuclear expression was detected in 80.7% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis cases and 62.5% of Graves' disease cases, with positive correlation between LMP1 and EBER positivity in all Hashimoto's thyroiditis LMP1-positive cases. We assume that high prevalence of EBV infection in cases of Hashimoto's and Graves' diseases imply a potential aetiological role of EBV in autoimmune thyroiditis. The initiation of autoimmune thyroiditis could start with EBV latency type III infection of follicular epithelium characterised by LMP1 expression involving the production of inflammatory mediators leading to recruitment of lymphocytes. The EBV positivity of the infiltrating lymphocytes could be only the presentation of a carrier state, but in cases with EBER+\/ LMP1+ lymphocytes (transforming latent infection) it could represent a negative prognostic marker pointing to a higher risk of primary thyroid lymphoma development.

The efficiency of this method is dependent on many factors; therefore, the present paper aims to identify the parameters that have a crucial impact on the efficacy of radioiodine therapy for Graves' disease. The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the medical documentation of 700 Graves' disease sufferers treated with (131)I. The patients were divided into three groups depending on the thyroid-absorbed dose of (131)I: group I - 100 Gy, II - 150 Gy, and III - 200 Gy. The authors assessed the influence of gender, age, presence of orbitopathy, TRab titres, thyroid mass, iodine uptake after 24 and 48 hours, and the absorbed dose on the treatment efficacy at one year post-(131)I administration. The volume of thyroid gland (P &lt; 0.002) and the thyroid-absorbed dose (P &lt; 0.001) were the only factors that had a significant impact on the outcome of the treatment. The likelihood of hyperthyroidism persisting (odds ratio: 3.71, 95% confidence interval: 2.4-5.87) was greatest in patients from group I. In group II, with thyroid volume amounting both to 25 mL and to 25-50 mL, the percentage of hyperthyroidism was lowest (1 and 0%). However, with thyroid volume &gt; 50 mL, the percentage of hyperthyroidism was lowest in group III (10%). The absorbed dose of (131)I and the volume of the thyroid gland are two parameters that have a significant influence on the efficacy of radioiodine therapy for Graves' disease. 150 Gy is the optimal dose for glands &lt; 50 mL. A goitre &gt; 50 mL requires an absorbed dose of 200 Gy in order to minimise the risk of recurrent hyperthyroidism.

Somatic mutations (RET, RAS genes) were evaluated in 78 snap-frozen MTC samples (57 sporadic and 21 hereditary) by direct sequencing. Next, three randomly selected RET-negative MTC samples were analysed by the next generation sequencing. RAS mutation was detected in 26.5% of 49 sporadic MTC tumours. None of all the analysed samples showed N-RAS mutation. When only RET-negative samples were considered, the prevalence of RAS mutation was 68.7%, compared to 6% observed in RET-positive samples. Most of these mutations were located in H-RAS codon 61 (72%). None of 21 hereditary MTC samples showed any RAS mutations.

We retrospectively analysed 61 patients participating in our previous studies, who because of isolated hypercholesterolaemia were treated with simvastatin (40 mg daily), ezetimibe (10 mg daily) or simvastatin (40 mg daily) plus ezetimibe (10 mg daily). Plasma levels of leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), free fatty acids (FFA), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were assessed separately for men and women before and after 30 days of treatment. At baseline, plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin were lower, while plasma levels of TNF-alpha were higher in men than in women. Administration of simvastatin and statin\/ezetimibe combination for 30 days reduced plasma levels of hsCRP, FFA, leptin, visfatin, and TNF-alpha but increased plasma levels of adiponectin, while the effect of ezetimibe was much more limited. The effect of simvastatin and ezetimibe, administered alone or in combination, on plasma hsCRP, FFA, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, and TNF-alpha did not differ between men and women. Irrespectively of sex, the changes in plasma adipokines and systemic-anti-inflammatory effects were more expressed in simvastatin - than in ezetimibe-treated patients and were strongest when both these agents were administered together. Our results show that sex differences do not determine the effect of hypolipidaemic agents on adipose tissue and low-grade inflammation.

The evaluation of serum adipocytokine concentration in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) could serve as a marker of cardio-vascular complication progression and an index of outcome in adulthood and after kidney transplantation. The aim of the study was to evaluate simultaneously the serum concentrations of six different adipocytokines: adiponectin, apelin, chemerin, omentin, resistin, and vaspin, in 28 children with CKD stage 5 on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The concentration of apelin, omentin, and resistin in children with CKD was significantly higher and the concentration of vaspin, adiponectin, and chemerin was significantly lower than in the control group. After adjusting to body mass index (BMI), the same results were obtained. After adjusting to body surface area (BSA), the concentration of vaspin, adiponectin, and chemerin did not differ between children with CKD and the control group. In analysis of the correlation between serum total adipocytokine levels in children with CKD we found a negative relationship in pairs: omentin-apelin and omentin-vaspin, and positive in pairs: adiponectin-chemerin and adiponectin-resistin. Our results show that changes in serum adipocytokines concentration are associated with the kidney dysfunction in CKD in children. Longitudinal studies on larger groups of paediatric cohorts would be helpful in investigating whether adipocytokines play a harmful role in the development of CKD and would enable further understanding of the risk factors for CKD progression. ","572":"Currently, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is seen as more than just the preferred method, in fact as a routine procedure, always bearing in mind, however, the developed restraints on its usage. The size of the tumour, recurrent disease, and the existing invasive process all remain factors which determine the indications for operation. The situation is similar in cases of qualifying for sparing (non-radical) operations on adrenal glands. The basic challenge in terms of qualification, choice of technique and the range of operation of adrenal lesions remains: obtaining a reliable preoperative diagnosis, the localisation of lesions including their ectopic location, the evaluation of the imaging phenotype, as well as a proper pre-surgical preparation. Maintaining one third of properly vascularised adrenal mass allows one to avoid a substitutive therapy, with the possible necessity of its application in stressful situations. The first partial adrenalectomy has been conducted on a patient with a bilateral pheochromocytoma, in order to retain the glucocorticoid adrenal functions. The recommendations for its administration remain: hereditary pheochromocytoma of at least 2cm diameter, unilateral adenoma of at least 5cm diameter in Cushing's syndrome without any concomitant lesions in the oposite adrenal gland, and unilateral adenoma in Conn's syndrome. It seems that non-radical resection should always be considered for patients at risk of bilateral adrenalectomy in cases of concomitant lesions in both adrenals.

","576":"Chromogranin A (CgA) is a major, nonspecific marker of neuroendocrine tumours (NET). There are a few routinely used assays for the measurement of CgA concentration in serum or plasma. These assays differ in analytical techniques (radioimmunoassay, ELISA, CLIA, TRACE), have different calibrators, and use different antibodies which recognise different epitopes of CgA molecule. Our study was designed to confirm the noted earlier differences in CgA levels measured in serum and plasma, and to establish respective reference ranges in a group of healthy males. In 145 male blood donors (age 19-61 years, mean = 35.7), blood was collected into two tubes: one with EDTA2K (plasma) and one with clot activator (serum). Chromogranin A was measured by immunoradiometric kit (CIS bio, France). In blood donors, the median (and the range) of CgA concentration were as follows for serum samples - 42.0 ng\/mL (16-108 ng\/mL) and for plasma (EDTA2K) samples - 58.0 ng\/mL (23-153 ng\/mL). The differences between serum and plasma ranged 15-75% (median 26%). Plasma CgA levels were significantly higher in relation to serum CgA levels (p &lt; 0.0001). Correlation of CgA in serum and plasma was r = 0.8493; p &lt; 0.01. The reference ranges for CgA measured in serum and plasma in males, expressed as 2.5 to 97.5 percentiles, were: 21.0-108.0 ng\/mL and 31.0-153.0 ng\/mL respectively. 1.

The aim of this study was to determine if a HNF1B gene mutation was responsible for a dominantly inherited form of diabetes mellitus among the members of a three-generation Polish family. The index subject was a 13-year-old boy with metabolic syndrome, spina bifida occulta, posterior urethral valves, congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and a family history of diabetes of autosomal dominant trait of inheritance. We performed clinical and laboratory examinations of his family and sequenced the HNF1B gene. A novel Q248X mutation (nucleotide C to T transition at position 742 of the exon 3 of HNF1B gene, resulting in stop codon formation) was identified. Phenotypes of family members sharing this mutation are highly variable, and include previously known abnormalities of the urinary system and pancreas, diabetes mellitus of variable onset and severity, hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, elevated aminotransferases, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperamylasemia, short stature and cataracts.

Recently, USE has been applied in the evaluation of thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD).Thyroid inflammatory illnesses constitute a diverse group of diseases and may manifest various symptoms. These conditions may share some parallel clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic features, which can lead to diagnostic difficulties. USE may be an additional tool, supporting other methods in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of thyroid diseases, other than thyroid nodular disease.The aim of this article was to analyse and summarise the available literature on the applicability of different elastographic techniques in the diagnosis, differentiation and monitoring of various types of thyroiditis and AITD.

The rarity of the disease has stymied therapeutic development. Age distribution shows two peaks: the first and fifth decades of life, with children and women more frequently affected. Although 60-70% of ACCs are biochemically found to overproduce hormones, it is not clinically apparent in many cases. If present, endocrine symptoms include signs of hypercortisolaemia, virilisation or gynaecomastia. ACC carries a poor prognosis, and a cure can be achieved only by complete surgical resection. Mitotane is used both as an adjuvant treatment and also in non-operative patients. The role of radio- and chemotherapy is still controversial. The post-operative disease free survival is low and oscillates around 30% due to high tumour recurrence rate. The diagnosis is based on tumour histological assessment with the use of the Weiss score, however urinary steroid profiling (if available) can serve to differentiate between ACC and other adrenal tumours. Conventional prognostic markers in ACC include stage and grade of disease, and, as currently reported, the presence of hypercortisolaemia. Molecular analysis has had a significant impact on the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism of ACC development and the evaluation of prognostic and predictive markers, among which alterations of the IGF system, the Wnt pathway, p53 and molecules involved in cancer cell invasion properties and angiogenesis seem to be very promising. We here summarise our own experience related to the management of ACC and present a literature overview. We have not aimed to include a detailed summary of the molecular alterations biology described in ACC, as this has already been addressed in other papers.","587":null,"588":null,"589":"The objective of this paper was to assess the safety and efficacy of sunitinib malate in patients with well-differentiated metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) who relapsed on standard therapy. Overall, eight patients with well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours\/neoplasm (NET\/NEN G1\/G2, Ki-67 &lt; 20%), who had relapsed on a standard therapy approach, were treated. All had non-resectable, progressive disease. All received therapy using a standard dose of sunitinib malate. Adverse events were evaluated using NCI-CTC AE v. 3.0. Of the eight patients, seven had non-secretor and single secretor tumour (gastrinoma). Partial remission (PR) was noted in three patients (one after a single therapeutic line, two after two lines), five patients had stabilisation (SD) - including three individuals after three lines, one patient after two lines and another after a single line. Haematological adverse events: leukopenia (25%) - occurred in one patient after three lines and in one patient after two lines; anaemia (25%) - in one patient after three lines and in one patient after one therapeutic line. Mucocutaneous lesions were noted in 37.5% of patients after 2-3 lines of treatment. All of them experienced fatigue syndrome irrespective of the number of therapies. The majority of the patients simultaneously received somatostatin analogues, which did not exacerbate the toxicity profile. The median progression-free survival time (PFS) was 11 months. Sunitinib may be considered as a fairly well-tolerated and effective therapeutic option in progressive non-resectable PNEN patients in the second and subsequent lines of treatment, irrespective of the types of treatment previously applied.

The aim of the present paper was to provide more detailed data on FSHR expression in different subtypes of pituitary adenomas and to evaluate its possible role as a prognostic and\/ or predictive biomarker in these tumours. Forty two pituitary adenomas, surgically removed, were immunostained with antibodies against the pituitary hormones, antigen Ki-67 and 1-190 fragment of FSHR. The positive FSHR immunostaining was found in blood vessels endothelia of 88% of adenomas and in tumoural cells of 40% adenomas. In tumoural cells, the incidence of at least moderate FSHR immunostaining is significantly higher in invasive tumours (68%) compared to non-invasive (12%) ones, and higher (albeit not statistically significantly) in invasive-proliferating adenomas (Ki-67 &gt; 3%, grade 2b) compared to invasive but non-proliferating (Ki-67 &lt; 3%, grade 2a) ones.

The management of these patients has been widely debated. Recent studies have shown the importance of following up asymptomatic patients in order to reduce co-morbidity. However, there are conflicting opinions as to medical management. The aim of our study was to compare the outcome of PHPT patients on antiresorptive therapy vs. observation only. We longitudinally evaluated 157 PHPT patients (126 females) aged 22-90 years. Patients who did not undergo surgery were divided into two groups: those on anti-resorptive therapy (N = 52), and those without any treatment (N = 37). Patients who were disease-free after surgery (N = 50) served as controls. The values of serum calcium (S-Ca), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and indices of bone metabolism did not differ significantly among the three groups of subjects. No differences in 25(OH)-vitamin D levels were noted. Bone mineral density (BMD) was not significantly different at the spinal level. Finally, we found no evidence of an effect of medical treatment on quality of life (QoL). However, QoL significantly improved in the surgery group after parathyroidectomy (PTX). This study provided up-to-date information in terms of biochemical progression on the natural history of PHPT patients. No significant differences emerged between anti-resorptive therapy and observation only. It is not yet possible to assess the effect of pharmacological treatments on QoL in statistical terms. ","593":"Metabolically obese normal weight (MONW) subjects, despite their normal BMI, present metabolic disturbances characteristic of abdominal obesity. One of the reasons might be subclinical inflammation caused by the fat tissue excess. The aim of this study was to assess the association between the accumulation of fat (especially abdominal) and the concentration of selected proinflammatory cytokines - interleukins (IL-6, IL-18) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The study population consisted of 342 subjects (218 women, 124 men; age 20-40 years, BMI &lt; 27 kg\/m2) recruited from a community centre in Wroclaw. The group was divided based on the homeostasis assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA) value: 90 MONW subjects with HOMA &gt; 1.69 and 252 subjects as control group. Anthropometric parameters, serum IL-6, IL-18, CRP, glucose, insulin concentrations and insulin sensitivity\/resistance indexes were evaluated. CRP levels were significantly higher (3.26 vs. 1.97, p = 0.03) in MONW women than in the control group. Serum IL-6, IL-18 levels in males and females did not differ in both groups. IL-6 showed a significant correlation with the abdominal to gynoidal fat tissue deposit ratio in women. There were correlations between the CRP and BMI, WHR, waist circumference, total fat, abdominal fat deposit, and abdominal to gynoidal fat deposit ratio in both sexes. In women, positive correlations between CRP and HOMA, FIRI and negative with QUICKI index were present. Increased accumulation of abdominal adipose tissue in non-obese, young and healthy subjects is related to increased CRP levels. ","594":"It has been suggested that changes in the production of adipose tissue hormones in obese postmenopausal women might affect their bone status. The aim of this study was to determine whether obese postmenopausal women exhibited any relationship between serum levels of LP, ADIPO, RES, VISF, APE and bone metabolism markers (OC and CTx), OPG, sRANKL, the OPG\/sRANKL ratio as well as BMD. 80 postmenopausal women (60 obese and 20 healthy) underwent BMD measurement using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at lumbar spine L2-L4. Serum levels of selected adipose tissue hormones, OC, CTx, OPG and its soluble ligand, sRANKL, were assessed by ELISA. Obese postmenopausal women demonstrated a significant increase in body mass, BMI and WHR associated with significant increases in LP and RES levels, a decrease in ADIPO concentration, suppression of OC, CTx, OPG and sRANKL and an increase in the OPG\/sRANKL ratio and BMD. BMI correlated positively with BMD, LP, RES, OPG and the OPG\/sRANKL ratio, whereas in the case of ADIPO, OC, CTx, sRANKL the relationship was negative. WHR was positively correlated with the OPG\/sRANKL ratio, and negatively with ADIPO and APE. A positive correlation was found between BMD and LP, APE and the OPG\/sRANKL ratio, while the correlation between BMD and ADIPO, CTx, sRANKL was negative. Significant positive correlations were also revealed between OC, CTx and ADIPO; OPG and ADIPO; sRANKL and ADIPO, RES; the OPG\/sRANKL ratio and LP. OC correlated negatively with LP, RES, VISF, APE; CTx with LP, VISF, APE; OPG with LP; sRANKL with LP and APE; the OPG\/sRANKL ratio with VISF. ADIPO was an independent predictor of OC, OPG and sRANKL, while LP turned out to be an independent predictor of CTx, OPG, sRANKL and the OPG\/sRANKL ratio. Obesity in postmenopausal women can lead to changes in BMD, circulating levels of bone markers, OPG, sRANKL and\/or the OPG\/sRANKL ratio; these changes are associated with alterations in the concentrations of adipose tissue hormones under investigation. The relationships between bone status indicators and adipose tissue hormones, especially LP and ADIPO, seem to suggest that changes in these hormones observed in obese postmenopausal women might have a protective effect on bone tissue, most probably via a shift in the OPG\/sRANKL ratio towards a functional excess of OPG. ","595":"Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the main examination in diagnostics of thyroid nodules. Yet, it does not allow the differentiation of follicular lesions (FL). A new classification of thyroid biopsy results (newC) might improve pre-operative diagnostics mainly due to the introduction of a new subcategory of 'follicular lesion of undetermined significance', as well as the clarification of definitions of other categories. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of the newC on the distribution of the cytological results among main diagnostic categories and on the values of the parameters describing the effectiveness of FNAB in detecting malignancy. 34,371 FNABs outcomes and 3,557 results of surgical follow up were analysed. The frequencies of five main diagnostic categories in two periods: before (years: 2000-2009, 24,271 FNAB) and after the newC had been introduced (years: 2010-2012, 10,100 FNAB) were compared, as well as parameters describing the biopsy effectiveness, with a special focus on FL. In the second analysed period, the frequency of the 'suspicious for malignancy' results was three times lower, while diagnoses of 'malignant neoplasm' were 33% more frequent and the results corresponding to FL decreased by 10%. In respect to FL, specificity of FNAB increased (22.6% vs. 57.4%), but sensitivity decreased (78.8% vs. 50.0%). In respect to other diagnostic categories considered jointly, the sensitivity of FNAB (61.2% vs. 85.7%) and PPV (57.4% vs. 77.8%) increased, and the specificity was similar (95-97%) for both periods. NPV exceeded 95% irrespective of applied classification. Separation of FL with low risk of malignancy affects the values of the parameters describing the effectiveness of FNAB. The improved diagnostic effectiveness of FNAB is also a consequence of epidemiological changes and better selection of thyroid lesions for biopsy.

This study was designed to assess the feasibility and reliability of OSNA and real-time PCR for CK19 and TG mRNA in papillary thyroid cancer lymph nodes evaluation compared to standard histopathology. Each of 92 randomised lymph nodes from 32 papillary thyroid cancer patients were divided into representative parts and assessed using the three studied methods. Eighteen (19.6%) lymph nodes from ten (31.3%) patients were positive according to histopathology. When the cut-off value distinguishing metastatic from non-metastatic lymph nodes in the OSNA assay was set at 250 copies per microlitre, the results were positive in 16 (17.4%) lymph nodes from 11 (34.4%) patients. Twenty three (25%) lymph nodes were tested positive in real-time PCR for TG mRNA. Real-time PCR for CK19 mRNA was positive in 18 (19.6%) lymph nodes from 13 (40.6%) patients. No statistically significant differences were noted between the diagnostic accuracy of either molecular method compared to the histopathological examination (p = 0.81). Overall, 20 positive molecular biology results were noted in patients with negative histopathology results. Conversely, in 18 lymph nodes, despite a metastasis finding in histopathology, at least one molecular test yielded a negative result. It was revealed that OSNA is a reliable technique for the evaluation of lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid cancer. This method was shown to have equivalent accuracy to histopathology and real-time PCR. ","597":null,"598":"High dose intravenous glucocorticoid pulse (i.v.

The response rate of i.v. GCS treatment is significantly higher than oral glucocorticoid (oral GCS) therapy and is associated with fewer adverse events. However, a major concern was raised because of reports of fatal side effects which may be associated with this therapy, especially when single and cumulative doses of methylprednisolone (MP) are higher than recommended.

WS is caused mainly by biallelic mutations in the WFS1 gene, which encodes wolframin. Wide tissue distribution of wolframin and many mutations in the wolframin gene resulting in Wolfram syndrome may contribute to different phenotypes and the unusual combinations of clinical features. We describe a female patient with Wolfram syndrome diagnosed at the age of 25, with a previous false diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus and misdiagnosed diabetic complications. The patient was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations in exon 8 of WFS1 gene: a 2-bp deletion AT at nt 1539 leading to a frameshift (Y513fs) and a single-base substitution 1174C &gt; T resulting in a stop codon (Q392X). A detailed analysis of the patient's medical history and a review of the literature suggest that many cases of Wolfram syndrome may remain undiagnosed due to misdiagnosis as type 1 diabetes mellitus and incorrect interpretation of clinical symptoms of neurodegenerative abnormalities, especially in their early stages.","600":"The treatment of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for clinicians worldwide. The elimination of risk factors, such as encouraging smoking cessation and achieving euthyroidism, are the most important and usually sufficient treatment methods in most mild cases. A course of selenium may also be beneficial. High-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy remains the first-line therapy in moderate-to-severe orbitopathy; however in some patients such treatment may be insufficient. Radiotherapy for GO has been used for decades and is considered to be effective in active GO, although less than systemic corticosteroids. Unfortunately, there are only eight randomised studies that may be analysed to assess its true effectiveness and applicability. It has been indicated that radiotherapy affects mainly eye motility and soft tissue changes, with almost no influence on exophthalmos. The combination of these two therapies has proven to be even more effective than either treatment alone, especially in subjects with resistant or recurrent GO. Orbital radiotherapy seems to be a safe procedure with few adverse effects observed long after the therapy. It should be avoided in patients with retinopathy, due to diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and in young subjects (&lt; 35 years old). Orbital radiotherapy, as a safe and generally effective second-line therapy, is used in some countries as a supporting method during the second course of systemic corticosteroid therapy, if the response to the first course is unsatisfactory.

Venous blood for plasma glucose, AG and DAG assays were collected in both groups after an overnight fast and two hours after the consumption of a standard 300 kcal-mixed meal (Nutridrink, Nutricia). Mean fasting values of both AG and DAG were significantly lower in the obese individuals. On the other hand, among non-obese controls, the mean postprandial DAG levels did not change and AG levels decreased, whereas in obese individuals the mean DAG levels after a mixed-meal diminished and AG levels were unchanged. It is necessary to distinguish between the desacylated and acylated forms of ghrelin, as we have shown differential postprandial AG and DAG responses in obese and non-obese individuals. Whether targeting changed proportions between AG and DAG could be a successful strategy in obesity treatment remains a question for future studies.

Since peak bone mass is achieved by the third decade of life or later, the aim of this study was to relate sex steroid hormones and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels to bone quality in men during their third and fourth decades of life. Eighty men, healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 39 years, were subjected to an interviewer-administered questionnaire, body mass index (BMI) measurement, blood sample and calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) (Hologic-SAHARA). Blood was assessed for testosterone (T), oestradiol (E2), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), SHBG, luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Free and bioavailable T and E2 levels were calculated knowing SHBG and albumin levels. While T, E2, DHEAS, LH and FSH levels were not related, free and bioavailable fractions of T and E2 were positively associated with QUS readings. SHBG level was associated negatively. After dichotomisation for age, the associations remained significant only for younger subjects (18-30 years, n = 47). After adjustment for other co-variants, only SHBG in younger subjects retained its negative association with QUS. Older subjects (31-39 years, n = 33) revealed higher BMI and lower serum concentrations of total (-17 %), free (-18.5%) and bioavailable (-22.5%) levels of E2 than younger subjects.

The analysis comprised 150 short children (117 boys), with childhood-onset isolated, non-acquired GHD who completed GH therapy and attained FH. Before treatment and at FH (in retesting), auxological parameters were measured, GH peak in stimulation tests and IGF-I concentration were assessed, and pituitary height (PHt) was measured before treatment. The incidence of persistent GHD was 12.0%. The patients with persistent GHD had before treatment significantly lower GH and IGF-I secretion, as well as significantly better increase of height SDS (DHSDS) during GH therapy than those with transient GHD. A negative correlation was observed between DHSDS and IGF-I concentration, but not between DHSDS and GH peak. There was no significant difference in the incidence of pituitary hypoplasia between the patients with persistent and transient GHD. The incidence of persistent GHD in patients with childhood-onset, isolated, non-acquired GHD is relatively low.

Differentiating between benign and malignant lesions is an emerging challenge in endocrinological practice. Ultrasonography (US) remains the most commonly applied method in the preliminary assessment of lesions and is the basis for the decision as to fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and further diagnostics. Many studies have evaluated the diagnostic value of US malignancy features. However, they focused mainly on papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). It remains unclear whether other types of thyroid carcinoma (TC) are also characterised by the same US features. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of US features considered as markers in the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The PubMed\/MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify studies on US features of MTCs. The random-effects model was used to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity and odds ratios (OR) - if a comparison with PTCs was available. Hypoechogenicity was present in 83.4% of MTCs, and 32.7% were markedly hypoechogenic. None of the 157 MTCs was hyperechogenic. Sensitivity of halo absence was 88.9%, but irregular margins were present in 38.0%. 35.5% of MTCs had microcalcifications, and 27.0% had macrocalcifications. 14.4% presented 'taller than wide feature' (higher anteroposterior than transverse diameter). Apart from macrocalcifications, all these features occurred insignificantly less often in MTCs than in PTCs. US features commonly considered as markers of malignancy can be useful also in the diagnostics of MTCs. However, MTCs tend to possess suspicious US features slightly less often than PTCs. Some features, such as hyperechogenicity, can be considered to be strong markers of benign status. Although the US appearance of the thyroid lesion is an important diagnostic factor, it is worth remembering that it does not allow for a definitive differentiation between benign and malignant nodules. In the case of MTCs, as well as other TCs, US examination remains a valuable diagnostic tool, but should always be interpreted carefully in the context of other examinations. ","612":"In patients with diabetic foot syndrome (DFS), an inadequate angiogenic response is observed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of VEGF-A, PDGF-BB, sVEGF-R2 and sVEGF-R1 in patients with diabetes-complicated diabetic foot syndrome and analyse them using selected clinical data. Forty seven diabetic patients, 25 women mean age 63 and 20 men mean age 60.5, with diabetic foot syndrome (DFS) were enrolled in the experimental group. To evaluate angiogenesis factors depending on Wagner grade, the subjects were divided into three subgroups: I - patients with 0 Wagner grade (n = 14); II - patients with 1,2,3 Wagner grades (n = 15); and III - patients with 4,5 Wagner grades (n = 18). The control group consisted of 20 healthy volunteers. The material for research was blood. Significantly higher levels of VEGF-A and PDGF-BB in the DFS cases compared to controls were observed (VEGF-A p = 0.000001; PDGF-BB p = 0.000051). Analysis of angiogenic parameters according to the stage of diabetic foot syndrome advancement showed higher VEGF-A level (I: p = 0.000867; II: p = 0.001827; III: p = 0.000024) and PDGF-BB (respectively p = 0.004113, p = 0.004224, p = 0.002480) in all the subgroups. Decreased sVEGF-R2 concentrations were observed in the I (p = 0.054) subgroup and the III (p = 0.03524) subgroup. In this study, a strong positive correlation between VEGF-A and PDGF-BB was observed (R = 0.66; p = 0.000001). Our study revealed that proangiogenic factor levels were increased in DFS. This is associated with lower limb ischaemia and hypoxic conditions. The stage of diabetic foot syndrome advancement influenced VEGF-A and PDGF-BB concentrations. ","613":"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a chronic microangiopathic complication of both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The TCF7L2 gene has been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes risk. We aimed to investigate the impact of TCF7L2 gene on the susceptibility of T2DM and DN in a south Indian population. Plus to evaluate the association of rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene with T2DM in the Indian population. The subjects recruited for this included 55 diabetic cases with diabetic nephropathy, 68 diabetic cases without nephropathy, and 82 non-diabetic healthy controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood and genotyping of TCF7L2 rs7903146 was performed by PCR-RFLP analysis. A literature survey was carried out into the effect of rs7903146 on genetic susceptibility to T2DM in Indian populations and we then performed a meta-analysis in order to evaluate its association with T2DM. Analysis of TCF7L2 rs7903146 in normal controls and diabetics with or without nephropathy demonstrated that the 'T' allele is associated with both diabetes (p = 0.049) and DN (p = 0.024), but this association is not independent of T2DM. Meta-analysis showed that the mutant allele and genotypes are associated with T2DM in Indian populations. In summary, a significant association exists between the 'T' allele and DN, but this association is not independent of T2DM. Pooled meta-analysis of studies on rs7903146 and T2DM confirmed that rs7903146 is significantly associated with susceptibility to T2DM in Indian populations.","614":"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is the most frequent syndromic form of monogenic diabetes coexisting with optic atrophy and many other disorders. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Wolfram syndrome among children with diabetes in Poland. These calculations were performed among Polish diabetic children, aged 0-18 years, from three administrative regions between January 2005 and December 2011. Epidemiological data was obtained by matching the results from the EURO-WABBPoland Project and the PolPeDiab Registry. Throughout the study period, we confirmed genetic diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome in 13 patients from Poland. Three patients originated from the studied regions with complete epidemiological data on paediatric diabetes. The total number of patients with diagnosed diabetes in the study equalled 2,568 cases. The prevalence of Wolfram syndrome among Polish children with diabetes is 0.12% (95% Confidence Interval 0.04-0.34%). We estimate that Wolfram syndrome is: 26 to 35 times less frequent than monogenic diabetes (MODY and neonatal diabetes) in the Polish paediatric population. ","615":"The physical health deficits and psychological disorders of women with Turner syndrome (TS) are the deciding factors in their treatment, but also their own relation to their own and their family's experiences. This study aimed to find the differences in psychosocial functioning of TS women coming from two different generations. These differences show the cohort effect as change in personal functioning and quality of life. In-depth interviews were conducted with 176 TS women and their parents to collect data. The first cohort was composed of patients up to the age of 29 (n = 139), and the second included patients aged 30 or above (n = 37). Fifty-two variables, important from the point of view of health and quality of life, were analysed in two age groups. The paths models were compared to analyse differences between the cohorts. Belonging to a particular age cohort significantly affected the variance of the biomedical variables tested, which seems to be related to the therapeutic procedure due to an earlier diagnosis and treatment for younger patients. We also found differences in the number and strength of the correlations between the factors of psychosexual development, personal and family resources, socio-economic life, and professional or educational activity. (1) The psychosocial functioning of TS women changes over time. This is a kind of illustration of the cohort effect. (2) Medical aspects of Turner syndrome may remain in connection with the psychosocial functioning of patients, and determine their quality of life. (3) Psychosociological resources are more complex and involved in younger women with Turner syndrome. ","616":"In the current study, we evaluated the accuracy of sentinel node mapping in thyroid cancer patients using both radiotracer and blue dye. 30 patients with a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) were included in the study; 2-3 hours before surgery, 0.5 mCi 99m-Tc-Antimony Sulfide Colloid was injected intra-tumourally. 15 minutes post-injection, lymphoscintigraphy images of the neck were obtained. Immediately after anaesthesia induction, 0.5 mL patent blue V was also injected in the same fashion. Sentinel lymph nodes were detected intraoperatively using gamma probe and blue dye. Total thyroidectomy was performed for all patients with dissection of central neck lymph nodes as well as sampling of the lateral neck lymph nodes. At least one sentinel node could be identified during surgery in 19 patients (63.3%). The median number of sentinel nodes per patient was 1. Sentinel nodes in 12 patients were pathologically involved. No false negative case was noted. Upstaging occurred in six patients (20%). Sentinel node mapping in papillary thyroid carcinoma is a feasible technique with high accuracy for the detection of lymph node involvement. This technique can guide surgeons to perform central lymph node dissection only in patients with pathologically involved sentinel nodes. Although SLN detection in the lateral neck lymph nodes increases the extension of lymphadenectomy, SLN mapping can result in upstaging in older patients (&gt; 45 years of age) or treatment plan change in younger patients (&lt; 45 years of age) by the detection of lateral lymph node involvement.

However, the use of RAI in euthyroid patients requiring chronic administration of amiodarone (AM) where other antiarrhythmic drugs may lack efficacy is still controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of an AM therapy prior to treatment with radioiodine therapy in euthyroid patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (PAF), who had been treated for hyperthyroidism in the past. This was a retrospective observational study. Patients were assessed at baseline and two, six, eight, and 12 months after RAI therapy. 17 euthyroid patients with PAF were qualified to the RAI (female\/male 3\/14; age range 65 to 87, median 71). The patients required chronic administration of AM as a prophylaxis against sudden death. Each patient received an ablative dose of 800 MBq (22 mCi) of 131I. At baseline and during follow-up, no side effects of the therapy and no signs of drug intolerance were observed. Subclinical hyperthyroidism occurred in two (11.8%) cases after two months of RAI and five weeks of AM administration. In this situation, RAI therapy was repeated. Three patients (17.6%) after six months, and another two (11.8%) after eight months, required an additional dose of 131I due to amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT). Twelve patients (70.6%) returned to spontaneous sinus rhythm within two months. Fourteen patients (82.4%) had sinus rhythm during follow-up after six and 12 months of treatment. Preventive RAI in euthyroid (but previously hyperthyroid) patients with PAF before administration of AM may be the method of choice. This is particularly important for patients who will require permanent AM administration as a life-saving drug. ","619":"To evaluate the usefulness of measuring maternal anti-TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs) and foetal ultrasound (US) monitoring in cases of current or past maternal hyperthyroidism. 77 pregnant women suffering from hyperthyroidism or with a history of Graves' hyperthyroidism were observed prospectively. Maternal serum TSH, fT4, fT3, TRAbs, and foetal US were performed at baseline and repeated every 2-4 weeks when needed. Neonatal thyroid status was assessed based on serum TSH, fT4 and fT3 obtained in the first days of life. 35 women were diagnosed with gestational hyperthyroidism and 42 with Graves' disease; among them 26 had current and 16 past hyperthyroidism. Foetal and neonatal thyroid dysfunction occurred only in cases of maternal Graves' disease: nine (21%) and three (7%), respectively. Active maternal Graves' hyperthyroidism and TRAbs elevated at least five times above the upper normal limit predisposed to foetal hyperthyroidism. Maternal anti-thyroid drug therapy (ATD) and low TRAbs and fT4 were the risk factors of foetal hypothyroidism. Abnormal foetal thyroid sonogram was the only sign of foetal thyroid dysfunction. Four patients (9.5%) had high TRAbs in the 3rd trimester (10.8-29.9 IU\/mL), but neither foetal nor neonatal thyroid dysfunctions were noted. In the cases of maternal Graves' disease, foetal thyroid dysfunction occurs more often than commonly assumed. Foetal thyroid US is a valuable tool in early diagnosis and monitoring of the foetal thyroid status in pregnancy complicated by maternal Graves' disease. The evaluation of biological activity of maternal TRAbs may be helpful in prenatal diagnosis in some cases.

Initially, the cardiac metastasis was visible only on a positron emission tomography (PET) scan using gallium-68-labelled somatostatin analogue; the sensitivity of an echocardiography scan was lower. Despite the advanced stage of the disease, surgical excision of the cardiac metastasis was performed. The patient underwent a total of eight operations, and received chemotherapy, radiotherapy and somatostatin analogues. Currently, he is on a targeted therapy with everolimus. As a result of the treatment, the patient remains in a good general condition. This is the second described case of cardiac metastasis of PNEN. Using different methods of treatment in the case of generalised pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour with low proliferative potential, patients are offered the chance to prolong their survival and maintain a good quality of life.

The pathogenesis involves both environmental and genetic factors, and FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated gene) is one of the most significant among genes predisposing to obesity. The role of FTO polymorphism in the development of obesity has been confirmed in many studies, but the effect varies significantly in different ethnic groups. Moreover, the exact mechanisms of FTO influence are yet to be explained. The association between FTO and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity has been extensively studied in recent years. This paper presents current knowledge about the role of FTO gene in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes in different ethnic groups and the association between FTO polymorphism and lifestyle modifications predisposing to adiposity.","625":"Occlusal splint therapy is a well-known method for the treatment of TMD. Muscle stretching and pain relief are effects of occlusal appliance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the plasma level of CGRP in patients with myofascial pain (RDC\/TMD Ia) and myofascial pain with limited opening (RDC\/TMD Ib) before and after muscle stretching with occlusal splint therapy. A randomised trial was performed including 35 subjects (males = 10, females = 25) in the experimental group and 30 subjects (males = 9, females = 21) in the control group. Blood samples were taken from the external jugular vein before and after 30 days of occlusal splint therapy. Plasma levels of CGRP were measured with a Radio Immunoassay Kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and Cobra Series Auto-Gamma Counting System. The results of the study demonstrated that CGRP concentrations were significantly higher after occlusal splint than before splint therapy: CGRP2 = 17.02 pg\/mL (SD = 5.85), CGRP1 = 13.78 pg\/mL (SD = 5.12), in the experimental group (p &lt; 0.05). In the control group, there were no statistically significant changes in CGRP levels: CGRP1 = 14.5 pg\/mL (SD = 4.87) to CGRP2 = 13.5 pg\/mL (SD = 4.63).

Although obesity may enhance the decline of testosterone, it is also the cause of metabolic disorders, which are additional risk factors of erectile dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether elevated body weight is associated with decreased serum testosterone concentrations and reduced sexual function in young men. Data on general health, medication, depressive symptomatology and sexual life was obtained from 136 men aged 20-49 years. Blood levels of LH, total testosterone (TT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), oestradiol, SHBG, total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined. Body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR) and free testosterone index (FTI) were calculated. A significantly reduced occurrence of sexual fantasies, morning erections and erectile function scores was observed in the oldest group compared to the youngest men with normal BMI, although orgasmic function was unchanged. A significant decrease in TT serum levels was observed in obese 30-year-olds compared to men with normal BMI, while in obese 40-year-olds decreased LH and SHBG levels were also found. No differences in the levels of lipids and sexual achievements were found among men with different BMI. However, erectile function and morning erections significantly negatively correlated with age, BMI and WHR, and positively with FTI, but not with other studied hormones and lipids. In young men, obesity can lead to a deterioration of erectile function as a result of lower testosterone levels as the only reason.

In 28 adolescent girls with PCOS, and 12 healthy regularly menstruating girls, clinical evaluation and hormonal profile were assessed and social competence inventory (SCI) and psychological gender inventory (PGI) tests were performed. There were no significant differences in all parts of SCI in absolute numbers or in sten scores between the study and the control group. Also in PGI, in both the feminine and masculine gender schemes, the differences between the groups were statistically insignificant. In the study group, DHEAS concentration correlated positively with self presentation score (r = 0.4, p = 0.03). There was also a significant negative correlation between testosterone level and SCI score (r = -0.5, p = 0.01) as well as assertiveness score (r = -0.5, p = 0.02).

About 50% of PCOS patients are obese, and insulin resistance affects up to 70% of these women. The endocannabinoid system contributes to human energy homeostasis. CNR1 is a biological candidate for human obesity and related metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between CNR1 polymorphisms and anthropometric and metabolic parameters in PCOS women. 130 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria were recruited. The control group consisted of 70 healthy women. Medical history was taken, and physical examination as well as assessment of anthropometric (body mass, height, waist and hip circumference, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]) and metabolic parameters (glucose and insulin, the insulin resistance index HOMA, lipid profile) was carried out. Genetic studies to detect six CNR1 gene polymorphisms were performed. The total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in PCOS women carrying T\/T genotype of rs2023239CNR1 polymorphism were higher than in those with C\/T and C\/C. There were no statistical differences in other metabolic parameters or in the value of BMI and WHR between the variants of rs2023239 CNR1 polymorphism. The other studied polymorphisms of the CNR1 gene were not associated with anthropometric or metabolic parameters in PCOS women. There were no differences in anthropometric or metabolic parameters between the variants of studied polymorphisms of the CNR1 gene in control women. On the basis of our study, it seems that CNR1 polymorphisms are not associated with obesity and metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, in PCOS women.

An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed in all participants and the first phase insulin response index (FPIR) was calculated. Serum concentrations of GADA, IAA and IA-2A were measured by RIA. HOMA-IR and HOMA%B indices were calculated using a computer calculator from website. At least one positive antibody was found in 28 relatives (31.1%) but in none of the controls. The most frequently detected antibodies were IAA (22.2%). The relatives of diabetic patients had significantly higher fasting insulin level (p), significantly lower FPIR index(p), as well as higher HOMA-IR (p) and lower HOMA%B (p) compared to the controls.

The aim of the present study was to assess IL-6\/IL-6R\/gp130 system and Th17 associated cytokines in different time points during and after pregnancy in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Serum levels of IL-6, sIL6R, sgp130, IL-17 and IL-23 were measured in 91 women divided into three groups: GDMin the 24th-28th week of gestation (visit 1), NGT at the 1st visit and GDM in the 29th-32nd week, and NGT at both visits. The patients with GDM recognised at the 1st visit had significantly higher IL-6 (p = 0.02) and sgp130 (p = 0.03) concentrations than had the women with NGT, whereas the women with GDM diagnosed at the 2nd visit had elevated sIL-6R concentrations (p = 0.03).

IL-17 and IL-23 were detected in approximately one-third of the population studied. A trend towards higher IL-17 levels was observed in the subjects with GDM, but the differences were not significant. Our results suggest that an increased serum sgp130 concentration in the patients with GDM might represent a compensatory mechanism, controlling intracellular IL-6 signalling and preventing the activation of the IL-6\/IL-6R pathway.

AITD development occurs due to loss of immune tolerance and reactivity to thyroid autoantigens: thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (TG) and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). This leads to infiltration of the gland by T cells and B cells that produce antibodies specific for clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease (GD) and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (cAIT). In addition, T cells in Hashimoto's thyroiditis induce apoptosis in thyroid follicular cells, leading ultimately to the destruction of the gland. Cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid diseases working in both the immune system and directly targeting the thyroid follicular cells. They are involved in the induction and effector phase of the immune response and inflammation, playing a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease. The presence of multiple cytokines has been demonstrated: IL-1alpha, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma within the inflammatory cells and thyroid follicular cells. Finally, cytokines derived from T cells can directly damage thyroid cells, leading to functional disorders and may also stimulate the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG), thus increasing the inflammatory response in AITD. Immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AITD are strongly related to each other, but differences in the image of cAIT and GD phenotype are possibly due to a different type of immune response observed in these two counteracting clinical thyroid diseases.

Additionally, melatonin is known to inhibit the forskolin-induced (forskolin is a strong adenylyl cyclase - AC activator) increase in cAMP accumulation in the rat pituitary. To determine whether the possible response of vasopressinergic and\/or oxytocinergic neurones to melatonin could be mediated through a cAMP-dependent mechanism, the effect of different concentrations of melatonin (i.e. 10-11, 10-9, 10-7, 10-5 and 10-3 M) on forskolin-stimulated AVP and OT release from the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial (H-NH) system was studied in vitro. Male rats served as donors of the H-NH explants, which were placed in 1 mLof normal Krebs-Ringer fluid (nKRF), heated to 37oC and constantly gassed with carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2). The H-NH explants were incubated successively in nKRF {fluid B1} and incubation fluid as B1 enriched with an appropriate concentration of melatonin, i.e. 10-11 - 10-3 M and\/or forskolin (at a concentration of 10-5 M) or their vehicles (0.1% ethanol or DMSO) {fluid B2}. After 20 min incubation in fluid B1 and next B2, the media were collected and immediately frozen before AVP and OT estimation by the RIA. The AVP and OT secretion was determined by using B2\/B1 ratio for each H-NH explant. We have demonstrated that the highly effective AC activator - forskolin significantly stimulated both AVP and OT release from isolated rat H-NH system. Such an effect of forskolin was reduced by melatonin at concentrations of 10-9, 10-7 and 10-5 M. The strongest effect was exerted by this hormone at a concentration of 10-7 M, which inhibited not only forskolin-stimulated, but also basal, AVP and OT release. On the contrary, the highest studied concentration (i.e. 10-3 M) of melatonin stimulated both AVP and OT basal release, but when forskolin was present in the medium melatonin at such a concentration remained inactive in modifying these hormones release from the H-NH system in vitro. Our present results demonstrate that in the male rat: 1. The influence of melatonin on the vasopressinergic and oxytocinergic neurones activity is mediated partly through a cAMP-dependent mechanism. 2. The effect of melatonin in this respect depends on its concentration.

The final diagnosis was based on CT, MRI, biochemical studies, surgery or more than one year of follow up. The final diagnosis: nodular hyperplasia in six masses, six adenomas, three cysts, and one myelolipoma. All solid adrenal masses presented the elastography signal in contrast to cystic lesions that were devoid of it, as shear waves do not propagate through fluids. SSWE is a feasible technique that can be applied during ultrasound of the abdomen and retroperitoneum. SSWE presents potential for the differentiation of solid and cystic adrenal lesions.

The aim of this study was to compare the usefulness of conventional ultrasonography (US) to that of a novel method of tissue stiffness assessment - shear wave elastography (SWE) - in differentiating between malignant and benign nodules and in selecting the most suspicious lesions in MNG. Patients with MNG, referred for thyroidectomy irrespectively of indications for surgery, underwent thyroid US and SWE examination before surgery, between August and December 2010. Results of these examinations were correlated with the histopathological outcomes. 80 patients with 339 thyroid nodules were included. Ten thyroid cancers (TCs) in ten patients were diagnosed in histopathology. All ten cancers were the least elastic lesions in MNG (using quantitative data on maximal tissue stiffness). Four cancers appeared as the biggest lesions in MNG, while one was equally the biggest in a particular goitre (there were other lesions of the same size) taking into account maximal diameter. Three of ten cancers possessed the highest number of suspicious features in MNG, a further four had the highest number equally, with at least one other lesion in the same goitre. On the basis of our results, the relatively high stiffness of a lesion compared to other nodules from the same MNG should be considered as a strong argument for choosing that particular one for FNAB.

In this self-controlled, prospective trial, 220 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (mean age 67 years) received a single infusion of ZOL 5 mg at baseline and month 12. BMD, HRQL and Fall Index (FI) were measured at baseline, and months 12 and 24 (before each use of ZOL). The main outcome measures were the changes in lumbar spine and hip BMD and the changes in HRQL, the Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36). Additional comparisons were based on the FI. LSD multiple comparisons were used in the comparisons of BMD, SF-36 domain scores and FI. The patients had significantly higher L1-4, total hip, femoral neck and trochanter BMD (P &lt; 0.05) with improved HRQL (P &lt; 0.05) over two years of treatment of once-yearly ZOL 5mg. FI was reduced (P &lt; 0.05) with oral daily elemental calcium and vitamin D in the treatment course. ZOL improves BMD and HRQL, especially in the physical aspects, over two years of treatment in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, and can help improve balance ability.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-19, -44 and -63 in the Calpain-10 gene and the development of T2DM in a Turkish population. A total of 211 subjects were recruited: 118 patients with a diagnosis of T2DM and 93 unrelated healthy subjects. There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele distribution of SNPs studied between the patients with T2DM and controls (p &gt; 0.05), whereas the frequencies of 121 haplotype and 122\/121 haplotype combination were found to be higher in patients with T2DM than in controls (p &lt; 0.05). No association was observed between the variations in the Calpain-10 gene and glycaemic control and lipid parameters (p &gt; 0.05). The SNP-19 insertion\/insertion was significantly related to increased body mass index (BMI) in male diabetic patients (p &lt; 0.05). The present study indicates that 121 haplotype and 122\/121 haplotype combination of SNP-19, -44 and -63 in the Calpain-10 gene are associated with the development of T2DM in Turkish patients.

The study was conducted in three groups 10 subjects each, of type 2 diabetic patients. In subjects studied an initial tests followed by repeated ones after 14 days of treatment with sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and vildagliptin in therapeutic doses were performed. Baseline test as well as lymphocyte subpopulations (total T cells, and T-cell subsets CD4+, CD8+, CD26+, CD45RA+, CD45RO+, CD4+\/CD25+) using 7-colour flow cytometry method were performed. In patients receiving sitagliptin no significant increase in lymphocyte subpopulations were observed. In patients who received vildagliptin significant increase of total T-cells (p &lt; 0.05); in patients treated with saxagliptin significant (p &lt; 0.05) though mild increased percentage of total T-cells and CD4+, CD26+, CD45RO+ subsets were found.

","646":"","647":"Insulin resistance is defined as a glucose homeostasis disorder involving a decreased sensitivity of muscles, adipose tissue, liver and other body tissues to insulin, despite its normal or increased concentration in blood. Insulin resistance may be asymptomatic or occur presenting a variety of disorders, such as: glucose tolerance impairment, type 2 diabetes, as well as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, obesity, and arterial hypertension. Insulin acts via specific receptors present on the surface of most cells of the body. The greatest number of these receptors is found on adipocytes, hepatocytes and striated muscle cells. There are three mechanisms of insulin resistance: pre-receptor, receptor and post-receptor. Multiple methods of assessing insulin resistance are based on the concurrent measurements of glucose and insulin levels in blood serum. The glucose and insulin measurements are conducted in baseline conditions or after intravenous administration of a specific quantity of glucose or insulin. The methods of assessing insulin resistance are divided into direct and indirect. The current 'gold standard' in the assessment of insulin sensitivity is the determination of tissue glucose utilisation using the metabolic clamp technique. The presence of disorders of carbohydrate metabolism has been demonstrated in thyroid disease involving either overt hyperthyroidism or overt hypothyroidism. The severity of the disease is proportional to the severity of these disorders. The possible influence of subclinical forms of both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism on carbohydrate disorders is still under discussion. Thyroid hormones have a significant effect on glucose metabolism and the development of insulin resistance. In hyperthyroidism, impaired glucose tolerance may be the result of mainly hepatic insulin resistance, whereas in hypothyroidism the available data suggests that the insulin resistance of peripheral tissues prevails.","648":"Foetal ultrasonography monitoring is a valuable tool in assessing foetal thyroid function when pregnancy is complicated by maternal Graves' disease with accompanying high levels of TSH receptor antibodies, or when antithyroid drug therapy is instituted. Among several ultrasonographic signs of foetal thyroid disorder such as abnormalities in bone maturation and heart rhythm, cardiac failure, hydrops, intrauterine growth restriction and polyhydramnios, goitre is the most sensitive one. Here we report three cases of pregnant women with Graves' disease accompanied by very high serum levels of TSH receptor antibodies. In all three cases, as documented by foetal or neonatal serum TSH and thyroid hormones measurements, foetal thyroid dysfunction occurred. The only ultrasonographic sign of foetal involvement was a goitre with decreased echogenicity and increased vascularisation, central or peripheral. This is the first report demonstrating that a foetal thyroid gland when affected by transplacental passage of maternal TSH receptor stimulating antibodies can present exactly the same characteristic ultrasound pattern of Graves' disease as in adults.","649":"Many studies have shown that cigarette smoking exerts multiple effects on the thyroid gland. Smoking seems to induce changes in thyroid function tests, like decrease in TSH and increase in thyroid hormones. However, these alterations are usually mild. In addition, tobacco smoking may also play a role in thyroid autoimmunity. Many studies have confirmed a significant influence of smoking on Graves' hyperthyroidism and particularly on Graves' orbitopathy. Here, smoking may increase the risk of disease development, may reduce the effectiveness of treatment, and eventually induce relapse. The role of smoking in Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not as well established as in Graves' disease. Nonetheless, lower prevalence of thyroglobulin antibodies, thyroperoxidase antibodies and hypothyroidism were found in smokers. These findings contrast with a study that reported increased risk of hypothyroidism in smokers with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Moreover, cigarette smoking increases the incidence of multinodular goitre, especially in iodine-deficient areas. Some studies have examined cigarette smoking in relation to the risk of thyroid cancer. Interestingly, many of them have shown that smoking may reduce the risk of differentiated thyroid cancer. Furthermore, both active and passive smoking during pregnancy might modify maternal and foetal thyroid function. This review evaluates the current data concerning the influence of cigarette smoking on thyroid gland, including hormonal changes, autoimmunity and selected diseases. These findings, however, in our opinion, should be carefully evaluated and some of them are not totally evidence-based. Further studies are required to explain the effects of smoking upon thyroid pathophysiology.","650":"Progesterone-treated females eat more food, but the mechanism underlying this effect is not well understood. The aim of the study was to analyse the effect of progesterone on neuropeptide genes expression in rat hypothalamus. Experiments were carried out on female and male Wistar rats. Animals were treated with progesterone (100 mg per rat) for 28 days. NPY and CART mRNA levels in hypothalamus were quantified by real-time PCR. The serum progesterone concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay. Progesterone administration to females caused an increase in food intake, body mass, and white adipose tissue mass. Elevated circulating progesterone concentration up-regulated NPY and down-regulated CART genes expression in hypothalamus of females. In males, elevated blood progesterone concentration had no effect on food intake, body and fat mass and on the neuropeptide genes expression in hypothalamus. Moreover, administration of progesterone in females resulted in decrease of PR mRNA level in hypothalamus. No effect of progesterone administration on PR mRNA level in hypothalamus of males was found. The changes in neuropeptide genes expression in hypothalamus may lead to stimulation of appetite and might explain the observed increase in food intake, body and adipose tissue mass in progesterone-treated females. ","651":"Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy may induce or worsen orbitopathy (GO) in Graves' disease (GD). The aim of this study was a prospective assessment of the risk of GO exacerbation in a GD patients cohort submitted to RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism. 208 consecutive GD patients treated with 131I in 2007 were enrolled. The analysis was performed on 156 patients strictly monitored for one year. Glucocorticosteroid (GCS) prophylaxis was administered if GO symptoms or GO history were present, and in cases of tobacco smokers even without GO symptoms. Clinical and biochemical evaluation at one, three, six, and 12 months after therapy was performed in the whole group, then at 24 months in 138 patients. There was no severe GO progression in patients without GO symptoms at the time of RAI treatment. The risk of severe GO worsening for preexisting GO patients (demanding systemic GCS administration) during the 12-month follow-up after RAI therapy was 10%. 12 and 24 months after 131I administration, stable improvement compared to the initial GO status had been achieved in most (98-96%) patients. 1. In patients with mild GO, the risk of severe GO worsening after RAI therapy is acceptable, as long as RAI therapy is applied with GCS cover. 2. In patients without GO symptoms at the time of RAI therapy but with a history of GO and with subclinical GO diagnosed by MRI only, the risk of severe progression is minimal. 3. Distant outcomes of RAI treatment confirmed its safety in GO patients.

Serum levels of selected adipose tissue hormones, OC, CTx, OPG and sRANKL were assessed using ELISA in 86 study participants suffering from AN and 21 healthy controls, all aged 13 to 18 years. Girls with AN showed a significant reduction in body mass, BMI, serum concentrations of LP, RES, VISF, APE-36, APE-12, OC, CTx and increased ADIPO concentration. These changes were associated with significant increases in OPG and sRANKL and a decrease in the OPG\/sRANKL ratio. Significant positive correlations were revealed between BMI and LP, APE-36, CTx, OPG\/sRANKL ratio; OC and VISF; OPG and ADIPO; OPG\/sRANKL ratio and LP, APE-36, APE-12. Significant negative correlations were revealed between CTx, sRANKL and RES, APE-36; OPG and APE-36, APE-12; OPG\/sRANKL ratio and ADIPO. VISF was shown to be an independent predictor of OC. APE-36 and RES turned out to be independent predictors of CTx, and sRANKL, APE-36 and ADIPO were independent predictors of OPG while APE-36, LP and ADIPO were independent predictors of the OPG\/sRANKL ratio. Changes in bone markers, OPG, sRANKL and\/or the OPG\/sRANKL ratio exhibited by girls with AN have been found to be associated with changes in the levels of the selected adipose tissue hormones. Abnormal relationships between bone metabolism and LP, ADIPO, RES, VISF and APE might adversely affect the balance of the OPG\/sRANKL system and thus potentially compromise the mechanism which compensates for bone remodelling disturbances.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3-K delta), a member of the PI3K class IA family, has been implicated in the regulation of inflammation since it is predominantly expressed in leukocytes. To date, no information has been available on the relationship of leukocyte PI3-K delta with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate changes in leukocyte PIK3CD mRNA expression in GDM women and, in turn, to correlate them with anthropometric and metabolic parameters of patients. Additionally, an association between leukocyte mRNA expression of PIK3CD and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was determined. Blood samples from women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n = 43) and GDM (n = 132) at 24-33 weeks of gestation were collected. After isolating leukocytes from the blood, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine PIK3CD gene expression in these cells. Univariate regression analyses were used to assess an association of leukocyte PIK3CD mRNA level with clinical characteristics of patients as well as with leukocyte SIRT1 mRNA expression. Leukocyte PIK3CD mRNA was increased by 1.98-fold in the GDM v. NGT subjects and inversely correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) in diabetic pregnancy. There were also significant positive correlations of leukocyte PIK3CD mRNA with plasma glucose concentration at 2h of 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and SIRT1 mRNA in the whole study population (both P &lt; 0.05). GDM is accompanied by leukocyte PIK3CD overexpression associated with reduced plasma LDL-C and TC levels, as well as with hyperglycaemia and elevated leukocyte SIRT1 mRNA.

Leptin (LEP) significantly affects metabolism and numerous functions of the organism. To find out if extreme longevity and its phenotype are associated with genetic variants of leptin and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes, we analysed the frequencies of the -2548 G\/A and +19 G\/A LEP, as well as the K109R, Q223R, and K656N LEPR polymorphisms in centenarians and in control groups. The frequencies of the LEP and LEPR polymorphisms were tested by restriction fragment length polymorphism in 128 centenarians, 414 young controls (Y), 226 myocardial infarction (MI) patients, and 190 type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) patients. The GG genotype of the -2548 G\/A LEP polymorphism was significantly more common in centenarians than in the Y, MI and DM2 groups (p = 0.048, p = 0.003, p = 0.049, respectively). In addition, the AA genotype of the K109R LEPR polymorphism was significantly less frequent in centenarians than in the Y, MI, and DM2 groups (p = 0.026, p = 0.013, and p = 0.001, respectively). We suggest that the leptin pathway plays a role in the regulation of longevity, possibly by modulating the risk of development of MI and of DM2.

The role of proinsulin, which is known to be an indicator of fertility outcomes in PCOS women, and that of adiponectin, in the pathogenesis of PCOS is not well elucidated. Our objective was to determine proinsulin, adiponectin, hsCRP and other hormonal and metabolic parameters in PCOS women before and after metformin treatment. Two PCOS groups of patients of reproductive age (90 lean and 88 obese or overweight) with two control groups, adjusted for body mass index (BMI), were compared at baseline. 32 PCOS women were studied at baseline, after three and six months of metformin (1,000 mg\/day) treatment. Clinical, anthropometric, biochemical and hormonal parameters were assessed. Proinsulin and hsCRP levels were the highest in obese PCOS women and were statistically different than in lean PCOS women (proinsulin: 11.4 v. 6.9 pmol\/L; hsCRP 2.46 v. 0.47 mg\/L, p &lt; 0.01) and than in obese controls. Levels of adiponectin were dependant on BMI. Plasma proinsulin and androstenedione levels decreased after metformin treatment only in obese PCOS women. PCOS, when accompanied by obesity, is associated with elevated proinsulin concentrations, which correlates with higher hsCRP and increased FAI. Proinsulin level decreases due to metformin treatment. Our results suggest that obese or overweight PCOS and lean PCOS are characterised by different hormonal and metabolic parameters and have a different response to metformin treatment.

The rate of detection of colorectal NENs is increasing, and this tendency will continue due to the widespread use of colonoscopy as a screening tool and the removal of all diagnosed lesions. This paper provides updated guidelines for the management of patients with colorectal NENs. Recent data on epidemiology, clinical characteristics, biochemical, and pathomorphological diagnosis as well as useful imaging techniques are presented. We look in detail at novel methods of treatment including endoscopic and surgical management, pharmacological and radioisotope therapy. We summarise monitoring of the treatment.","658":"We present revised Polish guidelines regarding the management of patients harbouring neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of the small intestine and appendix. The small intestine, especially the ileum, is the most common origin of these neoplasms. Most of them are well differentiated with slow growth. Rarely, they are less differentiated, growing fast with a poor prognosis. Since symptoms can be atypical, the diagnosis is often accidental. Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome occur in less than 10% of patients. The most useful laboratory marker is chromogranin A; 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is helpful in the monitoring of carcinoid syndrome. Ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, colonoscopy, video capsule endoscopy, balloon enteroscopy and somatostatin receptors scintigraphy are used in the visualisation. A histological report is crucial for the proper diagnostics and therapy of NENs, and it has been extensively described. The treatment of choice is surgery, either radical or palliative. Somatostatin analogues are crucial in the pharmacological treatment of the hormonally active and non-active small intestine NENs and NENs of the appendix. Radioisotope therapy is possible in patients with a good expression of somatostatin receptors. Chemotherapy is not effective in general. Everolimus therapy can be applied in patients with generalised NENs of the small intestine in progression and where there has been a failure or an inability to use other treatment options.

In this paper, we present the results of clinical, endocrine and molecular trials in a patient hospitalised because of primary amenorrhoea with typical phenotype of CAIS. The main objective of this study was to determine the molecular cause of androgen insensitivity syndrome in a 46,XY female patient. Molecular analysis of the AR gene was conducted using MSSCP (Multitemperature Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism) and sequencing methods. MSSCP analysis showed changes in electrophoretic mobility in exon 8 of the AR gene. Sequencing analysis revealed a missense mutation which has not been previously described. This is a c.T3816 &gt; C transition mutation which causes a S901P substitution in the amino acid chain (based on the latest NCBI reference sequence NM 000044.2). The identified c.T3816 &gt; C mutation in AR gene provides further evidence for the correlation between specific AR mutations and phenotype corresponding to androgen insensitivity.

The unsatisfactory efficacy of the traditional therapeutic methods for patients with metastatic disease results in a continuing search for more effective and targeted agents. Due to the increased vascularisation of these tumours, inhibitors of angiogenesis could be potentially a new group of drugs in pheochromocytoma\/paraganglioma therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of angiomodulators: VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and five endogenous and exogenous antiangiogenic compounds (endostatin; IFN-alpha [interferon alpha]; rapamycin - mTOR [mammalian target of rapamycin] inhibitor; JV1-36 and SU5416 (semaxinib]) on the growth of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line. IFN-alpha (10(5) U\/mL) strongly inhibited PC12 growth in a 72 h culture, increasing apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle. Rapamycin in a wide range of concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-8) M) induced a slight inhibitory effect on PC12 viability and decreased cell proliferation at the concentration of 10(-5) M. VEGF, endostatin and JV1-36 did not influence the growth of PC12. The study has shown for the first time that IFN-a inhibited the growth of pheochromocytoma PC12 line and confirmed the inhibitory action of rapamycin on these cells. The results suggest that IFN-alpha and mTOR inhibitors could be potentially effective in the therapy of malignant pheochromocytoma, and encourage further study in this field.

Metabolic syndrome components were assessed. On echocardiography, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), concentric remodelling (RWT &gt; 0.45), E' velocity, E\/E' index and global strain (GLS) were evaluated. PA was diagnosed in 32 patients (15.7%). OSA occurred more frequently in patients with PA (59.4 v. 42.4%; p = 0.058). Patients were divided into four groups: PA+ OSA+ , PA+ OSA-, PA-OSA+ and PA-OSA-. Newly diagnosed diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and increased fasting glucose were most frequent in the PA+ OSA+ group compared to other groups. The presence of OSA was associated with concentric remodelling, and the presence of PA was associated with higher left ventricular mass and higher frequency of left ventricular hypertrophy. In the PA+ OSA+ and PA+ OSA- groups, the most frequent geometry patterns were concentric hypertrophy (68.4%) and eccentric hypertrophy (54.5%) respectively. E' velocity was lowest and E\/E' was highest in PA+ OSA+ compared to other groups. GLS was lower in patients with OSA compared to those without OSA.

The majority of adrenal incidentalomas are clinically silent, but some may be malignant or pose other potential threats to life. Chromogranin A (CgA) is the main, nonspecific marker of neuroendocrine tumours (NET). In the adrenals, CgA is produced by chromaffin cells localised in the adrenal medulla. Therefore its measurement in blood might be used as a screening test for pheochromocytoma after the exclusion of other various causes of an increased CgA level. The aim of our study was to investigate plasma CgA concentration in various adrenal tumours. EDTA2K plasma samples were obtained from 195 patients with adrenal tumours and from 50 blood donors. CgA was measured in plasma-EDTA2K by immunoradiometric (IRMA) method. In the majority of patients with adrenal tumours not derived from neuroendocrine cells (chromaffin cells), except those with significant hypercortisolaemia and some patients with adrenal carcinoma, the plasma CgA concentrations were below the cut-off value. In adrenal tumours derived from chromaffin cells (pheochromocytoma), CgA levels were markedly elevated.

The controls were 94 boys matched for age, recruited from 1,256 subjects undergoing bone measurement for screening purposes. The skeletal status (amplitude-dependent speed of sound - Ad-SoS) was assessed by quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at proximal phalanges with the use of DBM Sonic 1200. Physical efficiency was assessed using Zuchora's test, and pubertal development by Tanner's score. There was no difference in mean Ad-SoS between the entire study group and controls. Ad-SoS values were greater in older than in younger boys, both in right and left hands. There were no differences between left and right hand measurements. There were positive correlations between Ad-SoS and shoulder muscle strength in boys. Negative correlations between Ad-SoS at phalanges of right and left hand and BMI were shown in younger adolescent boys only. Similarly, only in the younger group were positive correlations present between both hands Ad-SoS and overall physical efficiency and age. Ad-SoS correlated positively better with Tanner's scale scoring in the older group. QUS at hand phalanges in adolescent boys aged 13-15 years depends on pubertal development and shoulder muscle strength.

The purpose of this paper is to assess parathyroid function in patients with toxic and non-toxic goitres, up to five years following (131)I therapy. The study sample consisted of 325 patients with benign goitres (220 with toxic nodular goitre (TNG), 25 with non-toxic nodular goitre (NTNG), and 80 with Graves' disease (GD) treated with (131)I. The therapeutic activity of (131)I for each patient was calculated using Marinelli's formula. The serum levels of fT3, fT4, TSH, iPTH and Ca(2+), Ca and phosphates were determined one week before (131)I administration, as well as every two months up to a year following the therapy, and then after three and five years post-treatment. After two months following the administration of (131)I, all the treated patients showed a statistically significant above normal increase in iPTH concentrations (amounting to a value almost twice the norm in patients with TNG), which remained stable up to ten months after treatment, to return to normal level in the following months. In all the patients, Ca(2+), Ca, phosphates concentration remained within normal range throughout the course of the study. The concentrations of fT3 and fT4 quickly returned to normal after (131)I administration, and remained within normal range until the completion of the study.

The core set of samples consisted of 52 tumours (27 FTC, 25 FTA). Total RNA was analysed by oligonucleotide microarray (HG-U133 Plus 2.0). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied as a main method of unsupervised analysis. An analysis of biological character of genes correlated to the first six PCs was performed. When genes correlated to the first PC were used to cluster FTC and FTA, they appeared in two branches; one, relatively enriched in adenomas, with homogenous expression of subset of genes, and the other containing mainly carcinomas, with down-regulation of these genes and heterogeneous up-regulation in a smaller cluster of transcripts. Genes highly up-regulated in adenomas included some thyroid-specific transcripts. The second cluster of genes, up-regulated in carcinomas, contained mainly immunity-related transcripts. Immune response genes were found in the first, third and sixth principal components, improving the discrimination between carcinomas and adenomas. Our unsupervised analysis indicates that invasiveness of follicular tumours might be considered as the major source of variability in transcriptome analysis. However, the distance between both groups is small and the clusters are overlapping, thus, unsupervised analysis is not sufficient to properly classify them.

Documented trends in lifestyle, nutritional habits and physical activity appear to be associated with moderate or severe Vitamin D deficits resulting in health problems. Most epidemiological studies suggest that Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among Central European populations. Concern about this problem led to the organising of a conference focused on overcoming Vitamin D deficiency. After reviewing the epidemiological evidence and relevant literature, a Polish multidisciplinary group formulated theses on recommendations for Vitamin D screening and supplementation in the general population. These theses were subsequently sent to Scientific Committee members of the 'Vitamin D - minimum, maximum, optimum' conference for evaluation based on a ten-point scale.With 550 international attendees, the meeting 'Vitamin D - minimum, maximum, optimum' was held on October 19-20, 2012 in Warsaw(Poland). Most recent scientific evidence of both skeletal and non-skeletal effects of Vitamin D as well as the results of panellists' voting were reviewed and discussed during eight plenary sessions and two workshops. Based on many polemical discussions, including post-conference networking, the key opinion leaders established ranges of serum 25-hydroxyVitamin D concentration indicating Vitamin D deficiency [&lt; 20 ng\/mL (&lt; 50 nmol\/L)], suboptimal status [20-30 ng\/mL(50-75 nmol\/L)], and target concentration for optimal Vitamin D effects [30-50 ng\/mL (75-125 nmol\/L)]. General practical guidelines regarding supplementation and updated recommendations for prophylactic Vitamin D intakes in Central European neonates, infants, children and adolescents as well as in adults (including recommendations for pregnant and breastfeeding women and the elderly) were developed. Improving the Vitamin D status of children, adolescents, adults and the elderly must be included in the priorities of physicians,healthcare professionals and healthcare regulating bodies. The present paper offers elaborated consensus on supplementation guidance and population strategies for Vitamin D in Central Europe. ","677":"Primary aldosteronism is the commonest form of hormone-related hypertension, with an estimated prevalence of 6-13% in the generalpopulation of hypertensive patients. Among patients with resistant hypertension, the proportion of PA is even higher. Through intensiveresearch in the field of basic science and the creation of large registries of patients with PA, it is possible to understand the effect ofexcess aldosterone not only on the cardiovascular system but also on the morphology and function of the other organs. Recent researchhas highlighted the differences in the regulation of calcium metabolism in patients with adrenal adenomas and PA. A lot of attention hasbeen paid to the improvement of diagnostic methods, with particular emphasis on adrenal vein sampling, which is becoming increasinglyimportant. In recent years there have been many publications on the prevalence of mutations in the potassium channel in patients withadrenal tumours and PA. A new form of familial hyperaldosteronism - FIII, has also been distinguished. Treatment of patients with PAstill relies on the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or adrenalectomy, preferably preceded by a confirmation of aldosteronesecretion lateralisation by adrenal vein sampling. ","678":"Lipodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of diseases affecting adipose tissue distribution. Familial partial lipodystrophy of the Dunnigantype (FPLD) is a rare autosomal, dominant disorder caused by missense mutations in lamin A\/C (LMNA) gene where selective loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue from the limbs and trunk, and accumulation of fat in the neck and face, is usually associated with a variety of metabolic disorders including insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis and high blood pressure.In this report we present clinical and molecular features of three Polish women with FLPD phenotype coming from one family (a motherand her two daughters). FPLD was recognised under the circumstances of diabetes treatment, where sequencing of LMNA gene revealed heterozygous R482W mutation. In order to be able to recognise monogenic diabetes associated with lipodystrophy, it is important to bevery precise in physical examination while diagnosing diabetes and to be aware of the necessity of performing genetic testing. Diabetes appropriate differential diagnosis is essential for the treatment strategy, anticipation of the disease progression, and determination of the prognosis. It is necessary for an individual mutation carrier to look carefully at the patient's family.","679":"Growth hormone (GH) structure is stabilised by two disulphide bonds, C53-C165 and C182-C189 in human GH. Researchers have investigatedthe role of these structural features since the late 1960s. Early studies implied that the disulphide bonds would not be importantfor biological activity of GH. However, more advanced techniques, as well as clues from patients carrying mutations in their GH1 gene,have demonstrated that the integrity of the disulphide bond between cysteines C53 and C165 is required for biological activity of GH.In contrast, disruption of the C-terminal disulphide bond (C182-C189) has only modest effects on the biological potency of GH, despitedecreased binding affinity to GH receptor and reduced stability as shown by a comprehensive in vitro study.To confirm these results, we generated transgenic mice that express a human GH analogue, C189A, and observed normal growth-promotingand lipolytic activities. In this article, we present new data and review old results concerning the disulphide bonds of GH. We also discussrelevant mutations found in patients with growth disorders. ","680":"In the search for biomarkers that allow the prediction of neonatal growth and development, placental growth hormone(PGH), pituitary growth hormone (GH1), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and ghrelin concentrations were assessed in the amniotic fluid and in the umbilical cord blood of 92 neonates. The proteins were assayed by the ELISA method. Their concentration values were compared in 57 full-term neonates and 35 prematurely born neonates, as well as in both large (&gt; 4,000 g) and small neonates (&lt; 2,500 g). Also, body mass and placenta mass were compared. Statistically significant differences both between prematurely born neonates and full-term neonates and between large and small neonates were obtained only in terms of the body mass of neonates and placenta mass. The concentration values of the hormones studied did not show statistically significant differences. A distinct tendency was noticed towards an increase in PGH concentration in both prematurely born and small neonates. In large neonates, statistically significantly higher IGF-1 concentrations were found compared to the prematurely born neonates. Our studies indicate an important role for PGH in maintaining a proper IGF-1 pool and demonstrate the existence of a direct influence on the function of the placenta in prematurely born neonates through the activation of compensation mechanisms,which stimulate IGF-1 synthesis.

We detected that of the 86 patients, three with KS had a deletion of the KAL1 gene in exon 9, one of whom also carried a duplicationin exon 11; and three with nIHH had a duplication of the PROK2 gene in exon 3; a deletion of the GNRHR gene in exon 1; anda duplication of the same gene in exon 2, respectively. No abnormalities were found in the patient group for the PROKR2 and GNRH1genes. In addition, no genomic rearrangements were identified in the healthy control individuals for the described genes.

","682":"The aim of this study was to assess the validity of a continuous Metabolic Syndrome score (cMetS) in a nationally representativesample of Iranian children and to identify sex and age-specific optimal cut-off points of cMetS that are associated with MetS. This study was conducted among 3,254 schoolchildren aged 10-18 years. cMetS was derived by aggregating ageand sex-standardised residuals of waist circumference (WC), mean arterial pressure (MAP), glucose, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol(HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG). To determine the optimal cut-off points of cMetS for predicting MetS, receiver operator characteristic(ROC) curve analysis was used with an estimation of the variables' sensitivity and specificity. A graded relationship was documented between cMetS and the number of risk factors. Increasing mean values of cMetS with increasingnumbers of components were apparent for both genders. The overall optimal cMetS cut-off point for predicting the presence of MetS was 2.93 [sensitivity= 92%, specificity = 91%, area of the curve = 0.96 (0.95-0.97)]. The values for boys and girls were 2.97 and 3.26 respectively in the total study. This nationwide study confirmed the validity of the cMetS score in a population-based sample of Iranian children. cMetSappears to be an appropriate index for investigating the association between potential risk factors and MetS in epidemiological researchin Iran.

Recently,their incidence has also been revealed in endocrine non-gonadal tumours such as adrenal and pituitary tumours. Moreover, FSHR immunostaininghas also been reported in endothelium of intra- and peritumoral blood vessels of a large series of cancers. The presentpaper reports on the incidence of FSHR in both tumoral cells and some intratumoral blood vessels of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Sixteen NETs samples were taken from 14 patients. The tumour samples were immunostained using the antibodyraised against 1-190 amino acid sequence from the human FSH-R and anti-Ki67 antibody. In all the samples examined, the majority of tumoral cells were immunostained with anti-FSHR antibody. Positive immunostainingconcerned also the intratumoral blood vessels endothelia in a half of the examined samples. Immunopositive blood vessels were foundmore often in tumours with higher Ki-67 index. FSHR expressed in NETs, if they are functional, may mediate the signals which can enhance further tumour growth. ","685":"The aim of this study was the comparison of 24h urine free cortisol (UFC), serum cortisol at 11pm (SCM) and late-nightsalivary cortisol (LSC) in patients suspected for hypercortisolism, and an assessment of the usefulness of these measurements in diagnosingovert Cushing's (OCS) syndrome, pseudo Cushing's state (PCS) and subclinical Cushing's syndrome (SCS). The study group consisted of 82 patients, of whom four patients had SCS, three OCS and eight PCS. For measurementsof LSC, the ELISA method was used, and for UFC and SCM determination, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used. The highest correlation coefficient characterised LSC and SCM (r = 0.72). Area under curve (AUC) for SCM and LSC in receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) for OCS was: 0.86 v. 0.74; for PCS: 0.83 v. 0.70; and for SCS: 0.74 v. 0.79. Our findings suggest that LSC is more useful compared to SCM in diagnosing subclinical Cushing's syndrome. Moreover,LSC seems to be a valuable diagnostic criterion to distinguish pseudo Cushing's state. However, to obtain reliable cut-offs for LSC values,a larger group of hypercortisolic patients is needed. ","686":"The reported prevalence of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis associated with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is heterogeneous.The aim of this study was to evaluate some epidemiological, clinical, sonographical and histological features of operated thyroidnodules with background diffuse autoimmune thyroiditis. The study included 411 cases with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), of which 118 presented thyroid nodular disease(TND). Thyroidectomy was performed in 76 cases. Of these patients, 24 presented histologically confirmed DTC and 52 benign lesions.DTC types were as follows: papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) (n = 6), follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC) (n = 6), papillary microcarcinomas(n = 8), follicular thyroid carcinoma (n = 1) and the mixed form (classic PTC and FVPTC) (n = 3). The benign nodules were dominatedby: follicular adenoma (48%), and colloid goitre (40.3%). The sonographic features with predictive risk for malignancy in cases with HT associated with TND were represented by: solidcomposition, hypoechogenicity and microcalcifications. The characters of margins, the nodular shape and the type of vascularity do notseem to be as useful for identification of malignant nodules in HT. Fine needle-aspiration biopsy (FNAB) showed in DTC cases differentcytological smears: malignant (ten), indeterminate (eight), benign (two), and non-diagnostic (four). In the group of benign nodules, theindeterminate smears represented also a significant percentage (n = 12). The incidence of TND associated with HT was 28.7%. Among 76 operated cases, 31.5% presented DTC. The accuracyof FNAB in the preoperative diagnosis showed higher sensitivity (90.0%) and specificity (61.5%) compared to sonographic criteria.

New methods, including HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography), and LC-MS\/MS (liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry) have also been introduced into routine diagnostic laboratories. Because of the variety of assays and methods used, the question arises which one is the most accurate for the measurement of vitamin D metabolites concentration. In this review, we summarise the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, describe the complexity of vitamin D metabolites pattern in the circulation, and discuss the problem of accurate measuring its concentration.","689":"We present a case study of acute suppurative thyroiditis (AST) with frequent recurrence due to anatomical malformation described as pyriform sinus fistula (PSF). Difficulty in diagnosis and treatment may be explained by the rarity of the disease in adult patients. AST had been observed in our patient five times before a radical surgery treatment was performed. The most typical symptoms and signs in our patient include: fever, difficulty in swallowing and tender tumour in the left side of the neck. Computed tomography (CT), barium swallow study and endoscopic examination gave us an opportunity to confirm the presence of an anatomical abnormality. After fistulectomy, we have not observed AST up to the date of this publication.","690":"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two common forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aetiology and pathogenesis of IBD are not yet known. Genetic predisposition has been suggested as playing a role in the improper immune response to commensal microbiota. The main link of IBD pathogenesis is an intestinal immune system disability after enteric infection, resulting in an uncontrolled and chronic inflammatory state. Recently, numerous studies have been focused on the role of proinflammatory cytokines as well as hormones of adipose tissue named adipokines in the pathogenesis of IBD. Adipokines have pro- and anti-inflammatory properties and can modulate the immune response. It has been shown that obesity is associated with systemic microinflammation. On the other hand, experimental studies have revealed a link between levels of some adipokines and the severity of inflammation in IBD independent of body mass. The fat deposits called 'wrapping' or 'creeping' fat envelop the intestine, and adipokines produced by this tissue play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of this manuscript was to review the current literature concerning the role of adipokines in the pathogenesis of IBD.","691":null,"692":"To present a clinical picture and management of goitre patients with acute respiratory failure. A total of 7,356 patients were operated on between 2000 and 2011 for various goitres, including 1,214 (16.5%) retrosternal or mediastinal types. Eight (0.1%) patients (six women and two men aged 61-84, mean 76.9 years) presented with acute respiratory failure on admission. Seven patients were intubated on admission, and one showed severe dyspnoea at rest accompanied by symptoms of peripheral cyanosis. Giant retrosternal goitres were found in the eight operated patients. In two cases, the goitre was recurrent in character, and another two patients had previously suffered from hyperthyroidism (one treated pharmacologically, and one using J131). X-ray examination revealed tracheostenosis in all patients. No disorders in thyroid function was observed. Preoperative unilateral paralysis of laryngeal recurrent nerve was found in three patients. The operations were considered as most urgent. Four goitres were neoplastic: two were anaplastic carcinoma, one was follicular cell carcinoma and one was squamous cell carcinoma. These patients received partial resection to enable reduction of the goitre mass. In three patients, tracheostomy was necessary. On the other hand, four patients with non-malignant goitres underwent complete resection (one patient), nearly complete resection (two), and complete resection of one lobe and partial resection of the other (one). Three patients required mechanical ventilation postoperatively. Two of them, referred to the Intensive Therapy Unit, died from acute circulatory failure on day 6 and day 10 postoperatively. The rest were discharged in good general condition. 1. Acute respiratory failure caused by a giant goitre is a life-threatening condition that almost always requires an emergency intubation. 2. Due to a high risk of complications and high mortality, patients with acute respiratory failure caused by giant goitres should be operated in hospitals that are very experienced not only in thyroid but also in mediastinal surgery. ","693":"Different mechanisms for the expression of pendrin which is an apical iodide transporter have been reported in nodular thyroid tissues compared to normal thyroid. The aim of the present study was to determine the alterations of pendrin expression in nodular and surrounding non-nodular thyroid tissues and clarify the role of pendrin in the functional behaviour of nodular lesions. Twenty-six nodular and paired non-nodular normal thyroid tissues were collected at the same centre. Patients were divided into two groups based on the function of the dominant thyroid nodule; hot nodules (n = 18) and cold nodules (n = 8). mRNA levels of pendrin were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Pendrin protein expression was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. Results of dominant nodules were compared to non-nodular thyroid tissue of the same patient. No statistically significant difference was found with respect to qualitative and quantitative measurements of pendrin expression between hot and cold nodules. However, percent immunohistochemical staining of pendrin was significantly higher in both hot and cold nodules compared to non-nodular thyroid tissue of the same patients. RT-PCR revealed comparable mRNA levels of pendrin gene between hot nodules and corresponding normal thyroid tissues. However, in cold nodules, significantly decreased mRNA levels of pendrin were observed compared to normal thyroid tissue. mRNA levels of pendrin showed significant positive correlation with TSH in corresponding non-nodular thyroid tissues. The present study demonstrates that expression of pendrin could not be influenced by TSH in thyroid nodules and expression level of pendrin seems not to have an effect on nodule function.

A cross-sectional study by the method of cluster sampling was performed in 1,827 women, who were in hospital for routine check-up. Serum SHBG profile and anthropometric indices of hormonal, adiposity, and metabolic variables were measured. According to their age and menstruation status, the subjects were divided into three groups: pre-menopause group, peri-menopause group, and post-menopause group. Serum SHBG level was found to be negatively correlated with BMI in all groups and to increase in parallel with age in women of reproductive age. However, independently of age, it significantly increased from the onset of menopause transition, and slightly declined after menopause. After adjustment for age and BMI, HOMA-IR in peri-menopausal women was closely related only to SHBG. SHBG level was found to be the only independent significant determinant of HOMA-IR. On the basis of ROC curve analysis for the prediction of insulin resistance using HOMA-IR value, AUC for SHBG reached a value of 0.816 (0.636-0.996, 95% confidence interval). The best cutoff value that discriminates peri-menopausal women with or without insulin resistance is 41.73 nmol\/L, with a sensitivity of 81.4% and a specificity of 87.5%. Low SHBG level may be an independent risk factor of insulin resistance in Chinese peri-menopausal women.

Adrenalectomies were performed laparoscopically in 14 cases (93.3%): in nine by the retroperitoneal posterior mode and in five by the transperitoneal lateral approach. Molecular-genetic examination of VHL, RET, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD genes revealed inherited predisposition for PHEO in three of 15 patients (20%): RET mutations typical for MEN 2a in two patients and VHL mutation in one patient. Disturbances of the carbohydrate metabolism occurred in nine patients (60%). Ten patients (66%) reported paroxysmal symptoms. In all cases, with the exception of a von Hippel-Lindau patient, density of tumours exceeded 20 HU. In all studied patients, urine concentration of normetanephrines exceeded their normal range and greatly prevailed over metanephrines values, which were increased in six of them (40%). Urine metoxycatecholamines and increased tissue density are sufficient in pheochromocytoma detection. However, taking into account clinical and supplemental biochemical data may be helpful in the diagnostic process. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a fully sufficient and safe method of pheochromocytoma excision.

Fasting concentrations of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, T-chol., HDL-chol. and LDL-chol. were determined and the FIRI and QUICKI indices were calculated. Blood pressure, WHR and BMI were determined in all patients. Forty healthy volunteers were the controls. 133 patients had unchanged endocrine function, 32 demonstrated hormonal disturbances without clinical symptoms (in 26 nonclinical hypercortisolism). The WHR and blood pressure in the SCS group were significantly higher than in the patients with nonfunctioning adenoma (NA). T-chol and LDL-chol were significantly higher, but HDL-chol was significantly lower, in the SCS than in the NA patients. Fasting insulin level was significantly higher in the SCS than in the NA patients and controls, while fasting glucose level was comparable. QUICKI was significantly lower in the SCS and NA patients than in the controls, while FIRI was significantly higher in the SCS group. In incidentaloma patients, hormonal function of the adrenal gland should be estimated because some of them present subclinical hyperfunction. These patients frequently display features of metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance, hypertension, high triglycerides, T-chol and LDL-chol levels. Subtle autonomous cortisol secretion may be the cause of these features.

When high suspicion of Cushing's syndrome (CS) exists, recommended screening tests include the overnight dexamethasone suppression test, the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, or late night salivary cortisol. If the initial test is positive on two occasions, the patient should be referred to a specialist endocrinologist for in-patient assessment, while elevated midnight serum cortisol and a low dose dexamethasone suppression test will confirm endogenous hypercortisolaemia. Plasma ACTH measurement at 9 am follows and, if elevated, MRI scan of the pituitary should be performed. Corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) test helps to distinguish pituitary from ectopic ACTH-dependent CS, though bilateral petrosal sinus sampling remains the gold standard. Transsphenoidal surgery is the recognised first-line treatment of CD, and can be repeated if unsuccessful. Second line therapy includes pituitary radiotherapy, bilateral adrenalectomy and medical treatment. Pituitary radiotherapy is very effective but it usually takes several years for its full effect to be seen. Bilateral adrenalectomy is useful in acutely unwell patients, who are unable to tolerate medical therapy. The most effective medical agents inhibit adrenal steroidogenesis and include metyrapone, ketoconazole, mitotane and etomidate. They are used in preparation for surgery, when an operation has been unsuccessful, or when the effects of radiotherapy are being awaited. Cabergoline and pasireotide decrease ACTH production, but are effective in only 30% and 25% of patients, respectively. It is crucial for patients with CD to be managed in specialist endocrine centres, as the expertise of multidisciplinary team members predicts the best outcome.","701":null,"702":"Obesity is a disease in which the excess of accumulated body fat has an adverse effect on health and consequently leads to a reduced life expectancy.

It is not known whether a common factor responsible for the development of obesity occurs in a number of endocrine diseases. On the other hand, adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ producing biologically active substances with local or systemic action that can lead to severe disorders of the endocrine system.

The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of Gal on oxytocin (OT) release in vitro: an acute or prolonged osmotic stimulus was used as the stimulatory agent. Experiments were carried out on three-month old male rats which acted as donors of isolated rat hypothalamus (Hth), neurohypophysis (NH) or hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explants (Hth-NH). The effect of Gal on OT secretion was studied under conditions of non-osmotic (i.e. K(+)-evoked) (series 1), direct osmotic (i.e. Na(+)-evoked) (series 2) or indirect osmotic stimulation (series 3; neural tissues were obtained from animals drinking 2% NaCl). OT content was determined by radioimmunoassay. Galanin added into incubative media caused the inhibition of basal OT release from NH and Hth-NH explants prepared from euhydrated rats but stimulated basal and K(+)-stimulated OT release from the Hth tissue. Gal did not exert any influence on Na(+)-evoked OT secretion. We observed increased basal OT secretion from NH and K(+)-evoked respective OT release from Hth and Hth-NH explants taken from osmotically challenged rats under the influence of Gal. Present experiments in vitro show that: 1. Galanin plays the role of an inhibitory neuromodulator of OT release from the neurohypophysis; its effect is opposite at the hypothalamic level. 2. Galanin acts as the stimulatory neuromodulator of OT release in response to prolonged osmotic stimulus; an acute osmotic stimulus blocks OT-ergic neurons susceptible to Gal.

Forty seven adolescent girls with T1DM were evaluated and compared to 19 healthy and 21 non-diabetic girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In all subjects, basal and GnRH analogue stimulated androgens, gonadotropins and SHBG were measured and ultrasonography of ovaries was performed. Girls with T1DM experienced first menses significantly later than healthy controls [13.1 (12.0-14.0) v. 12.0 (11.0-12.0) years, p = 0.02]. Nine (19.2%) of them fulfilled PCOS criteria (T1DM+PCOS).

There has been no data on normal sex hormone (SH) levels in a Polish elderly population. In this study, we assessed SH in the PolSenior cohort to determine normal reference ranges in relation to gender, age, and cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVDRFs). The study was performed with 4,352 participants (2,168 men and 2,088 women), aged from 55 to over 90 years, stratified in five-year age groups. Pre-elderly subjects (55-59 years of age) served as the reference group. We assessed total testosterone (TT), estradiol (TE2) and DHEA-S (by RIA) SHBG and FSH (by IRMA) and calculated free androgen and free estrogen indices (FAI and FEI). Percentage body fat (%BF) was measured by bioelectric impedance analysis. The CVDRFs assessment included blood pressure and biochemical (blood glucose, high-density lipoproteins, triglycerides) and anthropometric (waist circumference) components of the metabolic syndrome. TT was low in 19.9%, normal in 78.2%, and high in 1.8% of men. TE2 was low in 94.6% of women. Age and CVDRFs significantly influenced values of SHBG, FSH, TT, FAI, FEI, and DHEA-S in men, while in women values of FSH, TT and TE2 did not change. BMI and %BF affected SH regardless of the age groups and CVDRFs. Our findings suggest that the reference ranges stratified by the five-year age bands seem more accurate than those given for the overall population over 60 years of age. The clinical relevance of these reference ranges increases when they are considered in relation to CVDRFs, BMI and %BF.

The majority of PDNEC are locally advanced or metastatic at presentation, and are only infrequently associated with secretory hormonal syndromes. PDNEC exhibit aggressive histological features (high mitotic rate, high Ki67 labelling index and presence of necrosis) and are further subdivided into two morphological subgroups, small and large cell variants. As PDNEC express somatostatin receptors less frequently, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is usually negative, whereas 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography appears to be the best method of evaluating disease spread and guiding further treatment. PDNEC have traditionally been treated similarly to small cell lung carcinoma, although they show a number of different clinical and histopathologic features. First line systemic chemotherapy with a platinum-based agent and etoposide is used for patients with metastatic disease, leading to variable response rates that are often of relative short duration. Sequential or concurrent chemoradiation is recommended for patients with locoregional disease. In patients with localised disease, complete surgical resection should be offered followed by adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy); the value of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been evaluated as yet. The role of second line therapies is evolving, with temozolomide being a promising agent. However, the majority of data regarding PDNEC is hampered by the small number of series and their retrospective nature, making it important that multicentre co-operative studies be performed.","714":"Pituitary apoplexy (PA) is a rare, potentially life-threatening medical condition due to acute ischaemia or haemorrhage of the pituitary gland. The main clinical features are: abrupt onset of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, deteriorating level of consciousness, visual impairment and\/or endocrine deficiency. Correct and prompt diagnosis is essential for effective therapy, but there are no randomised studies or strict recommendations defining treatment modalities. We present the case of a 59 year-old woman with pituitary tumour apoplexy, presenting with severe headache, vomiting and visual field deterioration. The patient was treated conservatively because of her refusal of surgery and was followed-up for five years. In the course of treatment, recovery of the visual field defects, as well as right sixth cranial nerve paresis, was observed. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed regression of the tumour without signs of its re-growth. We discuss therapeutic modalities with particular emphasis on morbidity and review the literature relating to the management of pituitary tumour apoplexy.","715":"Studies in mutant, gene knock-out and transgenic mice have demonstrated that growth hormone (GH) signalling has a major impact on ageing and longevity. Growth hormone-resistant and GH-deficient animals live much longer than their normal siblings, while transgenic mice overexpressing GH are short lived. Actions of GH in juvenile animals appear to be particularly important for life extension and responsible for various phenotypic characteristics of long-lived hypopituitary mutants. Available evidence indicates that reduced GH signalling is linked to extended longevity by multiple interacting mechanisms including increased stress resistance, reduced growth, altered profiles of cytokines produced by the adipose tissue, and various metabolic adjustments such as enhanced insulin sensitivity, increased oxygen consumption (VO2\/g) and reduced respiratory quotient. The effects of removing visceral fat indicate that increased levels of adiponectin and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in GH-resistant mice are responsible for their increased insulin sensitivity. Increased VO2 apparently represents increased energy expenditure for thermogenesis, because VO2 of mutant and normal mice does not differ at thermoneutral temperature. Recent studies identified GH- and IGF-1-dependent maintenance of bone marrow populations of very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) as another likely mechanism of delayed ageing and increased longevity of GH-deficient and GH-resistant animals. Many of the physiological characteristics of long-lived, GH-related mouse mutants are shared by exceptionally long-lived people and by individuals genetically predisposed to longevity.","716":"Osteoporosis is one of the commonest metabolic diseases of bone. Its possible causes may include thyroid hormonal dysfunction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism on osseous tissue metabolism in premenopausal women. 38 women with hyperthyroidism, 40 with hypothyroidism and 41 healthy women participated in this study. Initially after 6 and 12 months, each patient underwent selected hormonal, immunological and biochemical tests, measurement of concentrations of bone turnover markers and densitometry were also performed. On initial evaluation, lower cortical bone density was found in patients with hyperthyroidism (femoral neck). After 12 months, an increase in BMD was seen, but it was still lower than in the control group. Statistically significantly higher concentrations of bone turnover markers, decreasing from the sixth month of treatment, were noted only in the group with hyperthyroidism. Statistically significant differences were not noted in the femoral neck nor in the lumbar spine BMD in patients with hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism poses a negative effect on bone metabolism. Hypothyroidism in premenopausal females does not have any influence on bone density. ","717":null,"718":"Adiponectin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) play a role in glucose metabolism. Hyperthyroidism has an impact on carbohydrate metabolism and could affect insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to assess the associations between insulin resistance, adiponectin and SHBG among hyperthyroid Graves` disease (GD) women. The study was undertaken in 60 women with hyperthyroidism in the course of GD; 32 healthy women matched by BMI and age formed the control group. The concentrations of: free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), SHBG, insulin, adiponectin and glucose were measured, and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-I) was calculated. Compared to euthyroid subjects, hyperthyroid GD women had elevated glucose, fT4, fT3, adiponectin and SHBG concentrations, but there were no differences in HOMA-I. When we explored the relations between adiponectin as well as SHBG with glucose and HOMA-I, we observed that HOMA-I was associated with adiponectin and SHBG only in the control group, and in hyperthyroidism there were no such connections. We found positive associations between adiponectin, SHBG, fT4 and fT3 in the GD group. Elevated concentrations of adiponectin and SHBG were observed in hyperthyroidism but they were not related to insulin resistance.

This study evaluated glucose homeostasis and gut hormonal changes following surgical repair of gastrogastric fistula. Three patients with SLD underwent an oral 75 g glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before (baseline) and one week after gastric pouch restoration. Plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) were measured in the OGTT samples. Fasting plasma levels of ghrelin and leptin were assessed. Restoration of gastric pouch provided moderate amelioration of glucose metabolism and gut hormones, yet without complete normalisation of glucose homeostasis at one week after surgery. Duodenal passage exclusion resulted in early improvement of control fasting plasma glucose with decrease of glucagon from 18.5 to 15 (ng\/mL, by 19%), relatively stable insulin and decline of incretin hormones (GIP and GLP-1). Post-challenge measurements confirmed amelioration of glycaemic control with decrease of plasma glucose from 182 to 158 mg\/dL at 60 minutes. Surgical re-intervention resulted in exacerbation of GIP response with brisk rise in plasma level, accompanied by considerable increase of peak insulin concentration. The overall post-challenge glucagon and GLP-1 responses were decreased. Marked decrease in fasting plasma ghrelin and leptin were observed. Our report gives further insight into the hormonal mechanisms underlying the effects of surgically altered anatomy of different parts of the small intestine on glucose homeostasis that is highly important, since it may facilitate novel conservative therapies of diabetes without the need for surgery.

We present the case of a 76 year-old man in a sudden coma due to hypercalcaemic crisis as a first manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism. At first, the patient was treated conservatively, his mental status gradually improved in the next three days. On the ninth day after the initiation of therapy, a minimally invasive radio-guided parathyroidectomy was performed. Histologically, the tumour consisted of densely arranged chief cells immunohistochemically positive for PTH antigens, suggesting adenoma. Calcaemia level and PTH were normalised in the immediate postoperative period. A systematic review was performed by consulting PubMed MEDLINE for publications from 1958 to 2011. This review found a total of 499 reported cases of hypercalcaemic crisis due to primary hyperparathyroidism. Manifestations are neurological alterations, and cardiac, renal and gastrointestinal dysfunctions associated with markedly elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The most frequent histology is the parathyroid adenoma. In untreated cases, mortality is 100%. Despite advances in its management, the mortality rate is still 93.5% in patients treated only conservatively. Medical therapy followed by expeditious parathyroidectomy should be considered as the treatment of choice for patients affected by hypercalcaemic crisis due to a primary hyperparathyroidism.","725":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. The psychiatric disorders accompanying the clinical symptoms and hormonal abnormalities are important, but underestimated, aspects in PCOS. Obesity, hirsutism, acne, menstrual disturbances and infertility play important roles in lowering the quality of life in women with PCOS. Depression and anxiety are more often observed in patients with PCOS than in healthy women. Some authors consider that there is a relationship between valproic acid treatment of bipolar disease and PCOS.

Orexins participate in the regulation of pituitary hormones secretion, food intake regulation, and the sleep-wake cycle. It has been suggested that a defect of orexin A synthesis could be responsible for disturbances in GH synthesis in patients with acromegaly, and consequently aggravate metabolic disturbances caused by high levels of IGF1. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY was to assess orexin A levels in relation to the activity of the disease and the influence on metabolic profile in patients with acromegaly. The subjects were 55 acromegalic patients divided into three main groups: a surgically cured acromegalic group (SCA); a well-controlled acromegalic group (WCA); an active acromegalic group (AA); and 29 healthy controls. In all subjects, blood samples were taken to assess the concentration of orexin A, lipids, glucose, insulin and hormones of the pituitary and peripheral glands. The concentration of orexin A was highest in the control group (CG) and lowest in the WCA group. The differences of orexin A concentration were statistically significant when each group of acromegalics were compared to the CG. There were no significant differences in orexin A concentration among the studied groups of patients with acromegaly. The metabolic disturbances were more often observed in the groups of acromegaly patients. In the AA group, orexin A concentrations correlated negatively with plasma lipids.

This observation initiated the concept of the metabolically obese but normal-weight syndrome (MONW). Since then, there have been only a few studies in non-obese subjects. MONW men and women should be regarded as at high risk for cardiovascular disease. A group of 854 randomly chosen non-obese men and women, 20-40 years of age, was selected from three different areas of Poland - Szczecin, Krakow and Wroclaw. All subjects were interviewed and underwent physical examination, anthropometric measurements (waist circumference, hip circumference, BMI and WHR) as well as densitometry (total body DPX, total fat, android\/gynoid deposit). Serum level of fasting glucose and insulin, indices of insulin sensibility (QUICKI) and insulin resistance (HOMA, FIRI), total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL-C were measured using commercially available kits. LDL-C level was calculated using Friedewald's formula. The total amassed fatty tissue and its android deposit was found to be significantly greater in MONW men and women. MONW women were found to exhibit increased levels of triglycerides and LDL-C but lower levels of HDL-C. In women with excess abdominal fat (EAF), fasting glucose and insulin levels, HOMA and FIRI were considerably higher, while QUICKI was lower. Triglyceride and LDL-C levels were also higher while HDL-C levels were lower. In men with EAF, increased levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C were confirmed. The occurrence of MONW is contingent upon the diagnosis criterion and increases when the criterion represents the value of HOMA - 21.76% in women and 31.42% in men.

The study included 78 FHA girls who underwent a four-year sequential OP therapy with 17-beta oestradiol and didrogesterone. Changes in the lumbar spine BMD were determined at the end of the therapy and six years after its discontinuation, and analysed in regards to PvuII and XbaI polymorphisms of oestrogen receptor-alpha gene, BsmI polymorphism of vitamin D3 receptor gene, and Sp1 polymorphism of the type-1 collagen gene. After four years of OP therapy, a significant increase in BMD was documented in the studied group. Follow-up densitometry performed six years after completing the therapy revealed a significant decrease in BMD level; nonetheless, the values of this parameter were still significantly higher compared to pretreatment level. Neither the particular polymorphisms nor their combinations influenced the relative change in BMD at the end of the therapy and after a six-year follow-up.

Incidentalomas are most commonly benign tumours: adenomas, adipomas and angiomas; less often they are of a malignant or metastatic character. Establishing the character of the lesion and its hormonal activity is of crucial diagnostic significance. Diagnostics of pheochromocytoma covers marking the urine output of catecholamines and their metabolites, as well as marking serum amine concentration.

We evaluated serum gonadotropins and androgen concentrations in four divers before diving, immediately post, and 60 minutes after diving. We found that neither gonadotropins nor total testosterone, free testosterone, calculated free testosterone or bioavailable testosterone concentrations changed significantly during diving practice.

In addition, we wanted to investigate if those biochemical values show a correlation with the neurological condition of our patients. Adiponectin, leptin, resistin and insulin were measured in patients (n = 69) with first-ever ischaemic stroke (confirmed by CT), using specific electrochemoluminescence, radioimmunoassay and ELISA methods. Neurological evaluation was performed using Barthel ADL index on the day of admission and on the ninth day of hospitalisation. Insulin resistance value was obtained via the HOMA-IR calculator. Data was compared to that of healthy individuals (n = 26). Insulin concentration (51.08 v. 17.02 uU\/mL) and HOMA-IR value (6.3 v. 2.2) were significantly higher in the study group.

It occurs in genetically predisposed people and is induced by a gluten protein, which is a component of wheat.  The prevalence of histologically confirmed CD is estimated in screening studies of adults in the United States and Europe to be between  0.2% and 1.0%. The results of previous studies have indicated that the prevalence of CD is increased in patients with other autoimmune  disorders such as: autoimmune thyroid diseases, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and Addison's disease. A coincidence of the above diseases  constitutes autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS). The high prevalence of CD in APS is probably due to the common genetic  predisposition to the coexistent autoimmune diseases. The majority of adult patients have the atypical or silent type of the disease. This  is the main reason why CD so often goes undiagnosed or the diagnosis is delayed. CD, if undiagnosed and untreated, is associated with  many medical disorders including haematological (anaemia), metabolical (osteopenia\/osteoporosis), obstetric-gynaecological (infertility,  spontaneous abortions, late puberty, early menopause), neurological (migraine, ataxia, epilepsy) as well as with an increased risk of  malignancy, especially: enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, small intestine adenocarcinoma, and oesophageal and oropharyngeal  carcinomas.

Studies in which sentinel lymph nodes were detected by the blue dye technique and\/or by a radiotracer in patients with suspected thyroid cancer were analysed. Twenty five studies were included in the meta-analysis. Based on the technique used for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection, the included studies were divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of studies in which only the blue dye technique was used to detect SLNs. Group 2 was made up of studies in which the radioisotope technique was used. Studies in which both techniques were used were grouped into Group 3. There were 18 studies in which the blue dye technique was used to detect SLNs (Group 1), four studies in which only the radioisotope technique was used to detect SLNs (Group 2), and only two studies where both techniques were used (Group 3). Among 891 patients from Group 1, SLN was found in 740 (83.1%) patients. Detection rates in these studies were very different and varied from 0% to 95.5%. Among 160 patients from Group 2, SLN was detected in 158 (98.8%). In the third group of patients, in which both methods were performed, SLN was found in 48 (98%) of 49 patients. Detection rates in those studies were very high (100% and 97.8%). The analysis proved that SLNB is, technically, fairly easy to perform. However, nodal metastases are of debatable prognostic value in thyroid cancer, so the clinical value of SLNB remains to be proven. It seems reasonable to perform further, prospective studies on larger groups of patients, in which both techniques would be used.

","763":"The proper expression of particular glucotransporter (GLUT) isoforms determines a sufficient supply of glucose to tissues. The impairment of cellular glucose transport observed in insulin resistance leads to glucose metabolism disturbances. The aim of this study was the estimation of insulin resistance indicators and the quantitative expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-3 and GLUT-4 on peripheral blood lymphocytes in prediabetic subjects and persons with a positive family history of type 2 diabetes during 24 months of observation. The study included 25 prediabetic subjects (according to WHO criteria) and 24 normoglycaemic individuals with a positive family history of type 2 diabetes. Twenty three healthy subjects with no family history of type 2 diabetes, matched with BMI, served as a control group. All participants were recommended to perform physical activity for at least 140 minutes per week and to maintain a low calorie diet. The peripheral blood lymphocytes demonstrating expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-3 and GLUT-4 were labelled with the use of indirect immunofluorescence. The expression of GLUT isoforms was investigated by flow cytometry. Cells were stained by using anti-human GLUT antibodies and FITC-conjugated immunoglobulin. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACS Calibur (Becton-Dickinson). Additionally, we determined: fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin and C peptide concentrations, HOMA-IR, BMI and WHR. All the tests were performed at baseline, and after 12 and 24 months. At baseline, prediabetics and subjects with a positive family history of type 2 diabetes were characterised by a much higher expression of GLUT-4 compared to control subjects. Twenty four months of lifestyle modification resulted in significant lowering of the expression of GLUT-4 on the surface of PBL in both studied groups, with no differences in the expression of GLUT-1 or GLUT-3. Both prediabetic subjects and individuals with a positive family history of type 2 diabetes revealed no significant differences in determined insulin resistance markers after 24 months of the observation compared to the baseline values. The estimation of typical GLUT isoforms present on the peripheral blood lymphocytes, as well as the evaluation of insulin resistance indicators, are obviously insufficient for monitoring the metabolic disorders progression in the risk groups of type 2 diabetes. The decrease in GLUT-4 lymphocyte expression may reflect a positive influence of lifestyle modification on a tissue redistribution of this crucial insulin-dependent glucotransporter. The determination of GLUT-4 on the surface of peripheral blood lymphocytes can be a useful tool for the evaluation of the efficacy of therapeutic actions in subjects at high risk of type 2 diabetes.

Additionally, the blood glucose concentration was significantly lower after two weeks of metformin administration compared to baseline measurements (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the blood glucose concentration decrease during these two weeks was significantly higher in the insulin group (p = 0.01). Besides, APACHE II score was lower than baseline at the end of the study for both therapeutic groups (score of 10 vs. 15 [insulin] and 16 [metformin]). Finally, new renal dysfunction (maximum serum creatinine level at least double the initial value) was observed in three of the patients (two patients from the metformin group and one from the insulin group) in the last days of the protocol, although none of the patients showed lactic acidosis after ICU admission. Both metformin and intensive insulin therapy significantly decreased hyperglycaemia in ICU patients. Insulin caused a greater reduction in blood glucose concentration but required more attention and trained personnel. ","765":"We aimed to determine whether levels of thyroglobulin measured in blood from the inferior-superior thyroid veins and the peripheral antecubital vein could predict the presence of thyroid carcinoma in patients undergoing surgery for thyroid diseases. Sixty-one patients were prospectively enrolled in the study. Levels of thyroglobulin were analysed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of these markers were investigated. Twenty-six out of 61 patients (42.6%) with malignancy were diagnosed. The levels of thyroglobulin in the inferior-superior thyroid veins were higher than those in the peripheral antecubital vein (p = 0.001). The levels of thyroglobulin in the blood taken from the antecubital vein and the inferior-superior thyroid veins did not differ between benign and malignant thyroid disorders. For thyroglobulin, sensitivity was 33.3%, specificity 60.6%, PPV 27.8%, and NPV 66.7% respectively. Thyroglobulin levels in the antecubital vein compared to the inferior-superior thyroid veins were not significant either in benign or malignant disorders. ","766":"Vitamin D has been determined to have some effects on b cell function and insulin sensitivity, and it is known that type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperparathyroidism can cause obesity. The aim of our study was to investigate if vitamin D deficiency without diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome is associated with obesity and abdominal obesity. The study included 276 healthy premenopausal women. To exclude other causes of obesity, postmenopausal women and subjects with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome were excluded. Women were divided into two groups depending on their 25-hydroxyvitaminD(3) [25(OH)D(3)] levels: subjects with vitamin D deficiency (Group 1) and subjects without vitamin D deficiency (Group 2). Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were compared between the two groups. BMI, WC, WHR, rates of obesity, and abdominal obesity according to WC and WHR of Group 2 were lower than those of Group 1 (p = 0.0005, p = 0.0001, p = 0.0045, p = 0.032, p = 0.002, p = 0.011, respectively). 25(OH)D(3) levels negatively correlated with BMIs (r = -0.480, p &lt; 0.0001), WCs (r = -0.480, p &lt; 0.0001) and WHRs (r = -0.312, p &lt; 0.05). There were no differences between serum parathormone, calcium and phosphorus levels of Group 1 and 2 (p = 0.239, p = 0.354, p = 0.95, respectively). Vitamin D deficiency without diabetes mellitus and hyperparathyroidism may be associated with obesity and abdominal obesity.

The study involved 60 women admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine and Endocrinology at the Medical University of Warsaw. The initial evaluation, including case history and two-dimensional vaginal ultrasound, was performed by gynaecologists. All hormonal investigations (fT, free testosterone; bioT, bioavailable testosterone; T, total testosterone; T EQ, free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis; A, androstenedione; A EQ, free androstenedione by equilibrium dialysis; salA, salivary androstenedione; salT, salivary testosterone) were performed. Anthropometrical data, excess facial and body hair, acne, and menstrual cycle frequency were also assessed. Increased levels of T, fT, T EQ and A were noted in 20.0%, 89.8%, 100% and 28.3% of women, respectively. A very high correlation was found between salivary androstenedione and free androstenedione estimated by EQ in plasma (p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.67), and total androstenedione in plasma (p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.71). Correlation between salT and T was r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.05 and salT and T EQ was r = 0.26, p = 0.04. Correlation between salA\/salT and T, A in plasma (respective values r = 0.39 and r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.01) and between salA\/salT and A EQ, T EQ (respectively r = 0.34 and r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.01) was evident. SalA\/salT ratio may be a good indicator of hyperandrogenism in women. We also confirm that measurement of androstenedione in plasma may be useful in making a diagnosis of PCOS. ","769":"Several observations have suggested that the secretion of neurohypophysial hormones could be modified by gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH). Since, in medical practice, more often than GnRH itself, its analogues are used, the present study was undertaken to investigate the influence of the GnRH agonist - triptorelin on oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) release from the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial (H-N) system both in vitro and in vivo. Male rats served as donors of the H-N explants, which were placed in 1 mL of Krebs-Ringer fluid (nKRF) and incubated successively in: 1 - nKRF (B1); 2 - incubation fluid as B1 enriched with an excess amount (56 mM) of K(+) (S1); 3 - incubation fluid as B1 enriched with an appropriate concentration of triptorelin, i.e., 10(-11) - 10(-5) M (B2); and 4 - incubation fluid as S1 enriched with the same concentrations of triptorelin (S2). After 20 minutes of incubation, each medium (B1, S1, B2, S2) was collected and frozen before OT and AVP estimation by the RIA. During in vivo experiment, animals were infused intracerebroventricularly (icv) with triptorelin, at a concentration of 10(-7) M, and 20 minutes later they were decapitated. The neurohypophysis was dissected from the brain and blood plasma samples were collected and frozen for further OT and AVP RIA assays. The GnRH agonist - triptorelin stimulates both OT and AVP release from isolated H-N system at concentrations of 10(-9)-10(-5) M. The strongest effect was displayed by triptorelin at a concentration of 10(-7) M. Under the conditions of K(+) stimulation, triptorelin affects neither OT, nor AVP secretion in vitro. When infused icv, triptorelin, at a concentration of 10(-7) M, significantly stimulated both OT and AVP secretion into the blood. Triptorelin may play a role as a neuromodulator contributing to the functional regulation of OT and AVP secretion in the rat.

During the operation, only two superior parathyroid glands were found. One was normal, and hypertrophy was revealed in the other. After the surgical procedure, PTH serum level was 726.5 pg\/mL. Helical computer tomography examination showed a heterogeneous mass in the anterior mediastinum. The tumour was removed via a sternotomy approach. Histopathological examination revealed parathyroid carcinoma. PTH level dropped to 5.74 pg\/mL. Cytofluorometric examination revealed diploidy (DI = 1) in both the hypertrophic and the unchanged upper glands, whereas parathyroid cancer was aneuploid. After the initial operation, the woman was discharged from the hospital on the 27th postoperative day. One year after surgical procedures, she is well. She has to take calcium.","773":"Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (SAT), also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis or painful subacute thyroiditis, is the commonest thyroid condition responsible for neck tenderness. Other causes of pain in the thyroid gland should be taken into consideration during differential diagnosis, especially when a patient presents with misleading or equivocal signs and symptoms. We report the case of a 39 year-old woman diagnosed as having SAT whose clinical, biochemical and radiological presentation varied significantly from the common SAT manifestation. A tentative diagnosis of SAT was made based on the presented symptoms, ultrasonography and fine-needle biopsy results. However, biochemical analysis suggested neither inflammatory process nor the presence of thyrotoxicosis. Moreover, technetium scan of the thyroid revealed normal uptake of the isotope and there was neither clinical nor ultasonographic response for corticosteroids. The patient's symptoms, despite being prescribed typical treatment, gradually deteriorated and the pain became increasingly debilitating. Eventually, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy. As a result, she has become free of symptoms, but the macroscopic picture of thyroid gland, noted during the operation, gave a suspicion of neoplastic process. Nevertheless, histological study of flow samples confirmed the tentative diagnosis of de Quervain's thyroiditis, despite all previous findings that were not suggestive of it. This report confirms the likelihood that SAT can present atypically. Additionally, it indicates that surgical treatment may be considered in patients with severe, debilitating, persistent thyroid gland pain connected with SAT clinical course.","774":"Microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) represent molecular disorders acquired by the cell during neoplastic transformation. Both are associated with genetic instability. Functional silencing of tumour suppressor genes may be the consequence of genomic instability, particularly of the globally occurring LOH phenomenon. Numerous studies have confirmed the role of MSI\/LOH at both the early and the late stages of thyroid tumourigenesis. This paper reviews the available study results on MSI\/LOH significance and prevalence in thyroid neoplasms. Additionally, it summarises the knowledge regarding the practical usage of the study findings on MSI\/LOH in aspects of cancer risk assessment as well as the development of prognostic markers for thyroid neoplasms.","775":"The objective of this study was to examine the effect of testosterone supplementation on leptin release in rats which underwent castration and unilateral surrenalectomy. The study was conducted on 80 adult male Wistar albino rats. Animals were divided into eight groups, with ten animals in each group. Group 1 was the Control group, Group 2 the Testosterone group, Group 3 the Castration group, Group 4 the Surrenalectomy group, Group 5 the Castration and Surrenalectomy group, Group 6 the Castration and Testosterone group, Group 7 the Surrenalectomy and Testosterone group, and Group 8 the Castration, Surrenalectomy and Testosterone group. The animals in Groups 2, 6, 7 and 8 were administered 5 mg\/kg\/day intramuscular testosterone propionate for four weeks. Blood samples were collected for analyses of leptin, LH, FSH and free and total testosterone levels in plasma. Groups 3 and 5 had the highest leptin and LH levels of all the groups (p &lt; 0.01). Leptin and LH levels in Groups 1 and 4 were higher than those in Groups 2, 6, 7 and 8 (p &lt; 0.01). A comparison of groups with regard to plasma FSH levels showed that the concerned parameter was significantly higher in Groups 3 and 5 than in the other groups (p &lt; 0.01). FSH levels in Groups 1 and 4 were lower than those in all other groups (p &lt; 0.01). The highest testosterone levels were obtained in Groups 2, 6, 7 and 8 (p &lt; 0.01). Testosterone levels in Groups 1 and 4 were higher than those in Groups 3 and 5 (p &lt; 0.01). This study demonstrates that unilateral surrenalectomy in rats does not have a significant effect on leptin release, while plasma LH levels, rather than testosterone, may be more effective on plasma leptin. ","776":"The overexpression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) has been found in tumours, including pituitary adenomas. It has also been found that NOS is overexpressed in human spontaneous pituitary adenomas. The question arises whether NOS and its product, nitric oxide (NO), are involved in pituitary tumourigenesis. To investigate this question, in the present paper we examine the effects of NOS inhibition on the development of diethylstilbestrol (DES)-induced prolactin-secreting pituitary tumours in rats. Thirty male Fisher 344 rats, four weeks old, were submitted to subcutaneous implantation of a silastic capsule containing DES (10 mg\/capsule) or of an empty capsule. Six weeks after implantation, some of the DES-treated animals received a NOS inhibitor, N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (NAME), 1 mg\/mL, in their drinking water, for the subsequent 14 days. Eight weeks after the implantation, all the animals were sacrificed, their pituitaries were weighed, and samples of heart blood were collected for prolactin (PRL) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) measurements. It was found that DES implantation significantly increased pituitary mass, as well as PRL and VEGF concentrations in blood serum. On the other hand, the administration of NAME did not affect significantly either VEGF concentration or pituitary mass. On the other hand, it did induce a further increase in PRL levels. These findings indicate that NO is involved in oestrogen-induced hyperprolactinaemia, but does not play a crucial role in oestrogen-induced pituitary tumourigenesis.

The pathogenesis of non-dipper hypertension is not clear at present. We aimed to investigate the effects of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism on the development of a non-dipper blood pressure pattern via 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. 109 normotensive patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism were evaluated, and 95 of these patients without reverse dipping and masked hypertension were included in the study. The control group consisted of 75 gender- and age-matched, normotensive, euthyroid healthy individuals. Median serum TSH levels were 7.61 and 1.59 mUmL in patient and control groups, respectively. The number of non-dippers according to systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure was significantly higher in the patients with hypothyroidism compared to the control group. In linear regression analysis, TSH had a negative effect on the night\/day ratio of the systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures. Despite the fact that the effect of hypothyroidism on non-dipper blood pressure pattern is not known, the present study has revealed that elevated TSH levels are likely to increase the risk of non-dipping in normotensive patients with either overt or subclinical hypothyroidism.

Such tumours used to be considered as rare. However, recent data has indicated that they are more frequent than previously thought. The present paper shows that pituitary adenomas, diagnosed before surgery as nonfunctioning, often display GH immunopositivity. Fifty six patients with pituitary adenomas were included in the study. All the patients underwent transphenoidal adenectomy. In 37 patients before the surgery, clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (CNFPAs) were diagnosed. In 19 patients, acromegaly was diagnosed. All the excised tumours were examined immunohistochemically using the primary antibodies against the pituitary hormones or their subunits. All the adenomas in the patients with acromegaly were immunopositive for GH. Among the pituitary tumours diagnosed before the surgery as clinically nonfunctioning, 45.9% showed GH immunopositivity. Both somatotropinomas with acromegaly and 'silent' GH-immunopositive adenomas most often co-expressed prolactin, whereas GH-immunonegative nonfunctioning adenomas expressed mainly LH and\/or FSH. In three cases of 'silent' somatotropinomas, IGF-1 levels were slightly elevated, suggesting that these patients may present a 'low-symptomatic' acromegaly. GH-immunopositivity occurs in nearly half of 'clinically' nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Because of that, IGF-1 determination in blood before the surgery, and immunohistochemical examination of adenoma for GH after the surgery, should be performed as standard in all patients suffering from pituitary tumours, irrespective of the presence or absence of acromegaly symptoms.

With the rapid development of cross-sectional imaging, incidental detection of adrenal nodules has become an everyday practice, leaving clinicians with the necessity of further investigation. In this article, we present the current possibilities of adrenal gland imaging and we propose a diagnostic schema for differential diagnosis of incidentaloma. Non-contrast enhanced  computer tomography (CT) is a modality of choice used for the differential diagnosis of adrenal lesions. It allows the detection of 95% of adrenal masses, and the characterisation of most of them. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a good modality for cases in which CT  examination cannot determine the character of an adrenal tumour. Nuclear medicine study with the use of Iodine-131 meta iodobenzylguanidine(MIBG) is helpful in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT)  is considered a useful method in patients with a known malignancy history. Ultrasound has a low sensitivity for the detection of small  lesions and is not capable of reliable characterisation of visualised masses. However, this technique plays an important role in the follow-up  of non-hypersecreting adrenal lesions.","784":null,"785":"We present the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties encountered in a patient with a clinically advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour. The report concerns a 60-year-old female patient with the diagnosis of non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET G1) with liver, peripancreatic lymph node and mediastinal metastases. Due to the presence of advanced disease (inoperable pancreatic tumour, presence of multiple metastases) the patient was considered ineligible for surgical treatment on two occasions. Tissue samples for histopathology were collected during an exploratory laparotomy, which made it possible to establish the diagnosis. As somatostatin  receptor scintigraphy was positive, the patient was started on somatostatin analogues and radionuclide therapy was initiated, resulting in satisfactory response in the form of complete remission of liver metastases and the decreased size of the primary tumour in the pancreas. The use of somatostatin analogues in the case of an inoperable neuroendocrine tumour which was assessed as clinically advanced, yet  possessing a low proliferative potential, is a promising therapeutic option.","786":"Coeliac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy of varying severity. Osteomalacia and hypocalcaemia can result from malabsorption of  vitamin D and calcium, which, in turn, can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. If coeliac disease remains untreated for long, tertiary  hyperparathyroidism can also develop through autonomy of the parathyroid glands via chronic stimulation. Primary hyperparathyroidism also has been reported in some cases of coeliac disease. We report the case of an adolescent with coeliac disease presenting with severe hypercalcaemia from a parathyroid adenoma. A 14 year-old girl was admitted to our department for delayed puberty and growth retardation. Laboratory examination revealed iron deficiency anaemia, low 25OH vitamin D level (7 ng\/ml), high parathyroid hormone level (PTH) (955 pg\/ml), and hypercalcaemia (13.4 mg\/dl). Endoscopic biopsy was compatible with gluten enteropathy. Endomysium antibody was positive. A gluten-free diet was started. Her calcium returned to normal after excision of the parathyroid adenoma. After four months of the gluten-free diet, she began to mature, and puberty began with development of breasts and axillary-pubic hair growth. It has been  suggested that autonomous four-gland hyperplasia or tertiary hyperparathyroidism may progress to adenoma formation, and that this  should be termed \"quaternary hyperparathyroidism\".

Many somatic and mental disorders are thought to result from chronic stress. Stress-induced gonadal dysfunction  is not restricted to humans, but is observed in all higher animals. Stress-induced gonadal dysfunction comprises disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and of spermatogenesis. Various stressors induce changes in the secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones, such as CRH, ADH, beta-endorphins, somatostatin, VIP, PRL, GH, TSH, dopamine, serotonin, neuropeptide Y, melatonin, ACTH, glucocorticosteroids, catecholamines and androgens. In acute stress, testicular function is principally modified by cytokines and fluctuating concentrations of gonadotropins, while in chronic stress, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and disruption of spermatogenesis of varying  severity, including spermatogenetic arrest, are observed. In spite of the decades-long interest in the relationships between psychological  stress and the function of male gonads, many questions in this area remain unanswered.","789":"Type 1 diabetes is a chronic, incurable childhood disease.

The aim of this study was to determine plasma arginine vasopressin concentration in hypothyroid women under conditions of a low sodium diet and in an upright position. Twenty-six women with primary hypothyroidism and 24 healthy women (control group) were investigated. In all the patients, the plasma arginine vasopressin and serum sodium and potassium levels, as well as plasma osmolality, were measured first under basal conditions, i.e. after three days of a normal sodium diet (120 mmol sodium per day) in a horizontal position, and next after three days of a low sodium diet (10 mmol Na per day) in an upright position. In hypothyroid patients, the investigations were repeated after a euthyroid state as a result of L-thyroxine treatment had been attained. An increase of vasopressinaemia, measured under basal conditions as well as after three days of the low sodium diet, was shown in untreated hypothyroid patients compared to the control group. The arginine vasopressin plasma level normalised after a euthyroid state had been attained. As a result of the low sodium diet and the upright position, a significant increase of arginine vasopressin secretion was observed in the control group and hypothyroid women in the euthyroid state. No significant increase of this neuropeptide level in untreated patients was shown while applying the low sodium diet and upright position. Plasma osmolality and natraemia were decreased in the untreated hypothyroid patients. No correlation between vasopressinaemia and plasma osmolality was shown.

In addition, the sort of investigated biological material (whether it is serum or plasma) is of importance. There are also many conditions which may have a moderate or little influence on the concentration of CgA, among them are: inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), deteriorating liver function, untreated essential hypertension, heart failure, hypercortisolism, pregnancy, and, in some subjects, ingestion of a meal.

Clinical observation supports the existence of three main TED subtypes, namely ocular myopathy, congestive myopathy, and mixed congestive and myopathic ophthalmopathy. Although the precise pathophysiology of TED remains unclear, it is likely to reflect an autoimmune reaction involving sensitised T lymphocytes and autoantibodies directed against a specific orbital or thyroid-and-orbital shared antigen(s). One well-studied candidate in this immune reaction is the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which is also expressed in the orbital fibroblast and preadipocyte. Most patients with ophthalmopathy have associated Graves' disease, 10% have Hashimoto's thyroiditis in which the eye changes are often mild and expressed mainly as upper eyelid retraction (UER), and 10% have no apparent associated thyroid disease - so-called \"euthyroid Graves' disease\". Ophthalmopathy can also occur in some patients with transient thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, and Graves' disease many years after treatment of the hyperthyroidism - situations where TSHR antibodies are not expected to be present, suggesting that the relationship between TSHR antibodies and the eye disorder has not been established for all cases. In our studies of TED we have investigated the nature and significance of antibodies targeting other eye muscle and orbital connective tissue (OCT) antigens, in particular the calcium binding protein calsequestrin (CASQ1) and the orbital fibroblast membrane antigen collagen XIII. Our working hypotheses for the pathogenesis of TED are: i) the initial reaction in the orbit is antibody and T lymphocyte targeting of the TSHR in the OCT compartment, and ii) the associated extra ocular and upper eyelid muscle inflammation reflects either autoimmunity against primary skeletal muscle antigens such as CASQ1 or a secondary, non specific effect of the OCT reactions as proposed by the main proponents of the \"TSHR hypothesis\". Here, we review the evidence that autoimmunity against the TSHR expressed in the orbit can be implicated in the development of all cases of TED. Although there is a close general correlation between ophthalmopathy and TSHR antibodies there are many exceptions, suggesting that the continued study of the possible role of autoimmunity against calsequestrin and collagen XIII is justified.","800":"There have been many reports published in recent years on atypical subtrochanteric fractures after long-term bisphosphonates therapy.

This antibody is associated with RANK ligand (RANKL), inactivating it. In consequence, the formation and survival of osteoclasts are suppressed, leading to their apoptosis. All this results in lower bone resorption, while bone mineral density (BMD) increases. Denosumab also reduces the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. This agent is similarly effective in various stages of renal function impairment; it does not impair fracture healing processes nor contribute to atherosclerosis progression in patients with high cardiovascular risks. Following an analysis of adverse effects, performed in the FREEDOM study (in which it was demonstrated that the incidence of the majority of adverse effects observed in the course of denosumab use was similar to that in the placebo group), its safety for patients can definitely be confirmed.","802":"Most medical agents currently applied in osteoporosis therapy act by inhibiting bone resorption and reducing bone remodelling, i.e. they inhibit the process of bone mass loss by suppressing bone resorption processes. These drugs provide an ideal therapeutic option to prevent osteoporosis progression. They however have a rather limited usefulness when the disease has already reached its advanced stages with distinctive bone architecture lesions. The fracture risk reduction rate, achieved in the course of anti-resorptive therapy, is insufficient for patients with severe osteoporosis to stop the downward spiral of their quality of life (QoL) with a simultaneously increasing threat of premature death. The activity of the N-terminal fragment of 1-34 human parathormone (teriparatide - 1-34 rhPTH), a parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogue obtained via genetic engineering , is expressed by increased bone metabolism, while promoting new bone tissue formation by stimulating the activity of osteoblasts more than that of osteoclasts. The anabolic activity of PTH includes both its direct effect on the osteoblast cell line, and its indirect actions exerted via its regulatory effects on selected growth factors, e.g. IGF-1 or sclerostin. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the actual anabolic effects of PTH remain mostly still unclear. Clinical studies have demonstrated that therapeutic protocols with the application of PTH analogues provide an effective protection against all osteoporotic fracture types in post-menopausal women and in elderly men with advanced osteoporosis. Particular hopes are pinned on the possibility of applying PTH in the therapy of post-steroid osteoporosis, mainly to suppress bone formation, the most important pathological process in this regard. The relatively short therapy period with a PTH analogue (24 months) should then be replaced and continued by anti-resorptive treatment.","803":"Strontium ranelate is one of the first-line agents with proven anti-fracture activity used in the therapy of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Its mechanism of action makes it, however, different from other drugs, since it simultaneously stimulates two reverse processes: bone formation and bone resorption. The action of the agent depends on various mechanisms, including the activation of calcium receptors, localised on osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and on the influence on the OPG\/RANKL system. The drug effectively prevents spinal, hip and extravertebral fractures. The agent's anti-fracture efficacy within the spine does not depend on the patient's age, or on base BMD values, or on the concentration of bone metabolism markers. As to the anti-fracture efficacy in the hip, it concerns women with an increased bone fracture risk. Strontium ranelate increases bone mineral density within the lumbar spine and the hip, decreases the concentrations of bone resorption markers, and increases the concentrations of bone formation markers. The drug is administered in a daily 2.0 g oral dose. This paper presents indications to therapy with strontium ranelate, specifying also its side effects and contraindications. We compare the anti-fracture efficacy of strontium ranelate to the efficacy of other agents of proven anti-fracture activity, based on published clinical studies.","804":"In developed societies, the post-menopausal period covers approximately one third of a woman's life. The deficit of oestrogens observed during the post-menopausal period significantly affects the course of many metabolic processes, causing a number of diseases and in consequence diminishing quality of life. Among others, bones belong to oestrogen-dependent tissues. The deficit of the protective influence of oestrogens compromises the dynamic balance of the bone transformation process towards resorption, thus reducing bone mass and quality, while increasing the risk of low-energy fractures. In recent years, differing views on the application of oestrogen\/gestagen therapy have reached the level of controversy. The results of numerous clinical studies are far from unequivocal, with the whole subject one of heated debate. It has been confirmed that hormonal therapy prevents bone quality deterioration, while opening a protective umbrella around the bone, reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures. A rational approach to weighing possible advantages against possible risks and a thorough evaluation of a patient's health condition allows for optimal therapy selection.","805":"Osteoporosis is a chronic disease of the osseous system characterised by decreased strength of bone tissue, which in turn leads to increased fracture risk. It has been demonstrated that osteoporosis affects more than 30% of women after the menopause (World Health Organization, 1994). However, the disease is also observed in men. The primary goals of osteoporosis therapy include prevention of low-energy fractures and general improvement of quality of life. Any patient with diagnosed osteoporosis requires, besides prevention, the application of proper treatment. Of the available therapeutic options, the best are bisphosphonates, medical agents with well identified properties, therapeutic efficacy, and safety which has been confirmed in many clinical studies. Therefore, they are recommended as first line drugs for osteoporosis. The efficacy of oral preparations may be limited, due to low bioavailability, complications and adverse effects from the gastrointestinal tract. So the parenteral administration of bisphosphonates is a valuable alternative. A fine example of such therapy is the intravenous administration of ibandronate. Short injection time periods and the relatively long, three-month intervals between administrations are unquestionable advantages of this therapy mode. In addition, the therapy does not constrain a patient's everyday activity, and simultaneously provides regular contact with doctors and the therapeutic centre. Additionally, a good tolerance of the drug and its high therapeutic efficacy, proven by appreciably reduced fracture risks, significantly improves the quality of life of patients suffering from osteoporosis. This paper is a thorough review of current knowledge on the efficacy and safety of i.v. ibandronate in osteoporosis therapy, as presented in the latest literature reports.","806":"Steroid-induced osteoporosis is a textbook example of the secondary type of this medical condition. Glucocorticosteroids suppress bone formation by their direct and indirect effect on osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes, increasing their resorption and, eventually, leading to negative bone balance. A clinical problem arises regarding the fact that approximately 50% of patients on chronic steroid therapy undergo asymptomatic bone fractures. The treatment mode includes minimising the dose of administered steroids, encouraging an improved lifestyle and supplementation with adequate calcium and vitamin D(3) doses. Bisphosphonates are a group of medical agents used both to prevent and treat steroid-induced osteoporosis, although new therapies have also become available in recent years.","807":"","808":"Endocrine glands are well vascularized and the structure of their vessels facilitates the exchange of various substances, including hormones. These glands are a frequent experimental model in research on VEGF and angiogenesis. VEGF participates in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy is in essence a microvascular disease that develops as a result of a confluence of hemodynamic and metabolic perturbations. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and is the leading cause of blindness. In diabetic retinopathy ischemic states and hence tissue hypoxia and angiogenesis takes place. Participation of angiogenesis and VEGF in pathogenesis of neoplastic disease is described in many papers. VEGF protein and mRNA were found in cancers of the thyroid, bronchus, lungs, esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, breast, ovary, uterus, kidney, urinary bladder, in malignant tumors of the brain, bone. In a series of reports connections between the degree of VEGF expression with tumor aggressiveness and prognosis in patients have been reported. Richly vascularized are GEP NET. In neuroendocrine tumors strong expression of VEGF, Flt-1 and KDR in relation to the unchanged surrounding tissues has been demonstrated. Depending on the disease entity or the degree of its severity attempts of application the angiogenic and antiangiogenic therapy are being made. Antiangiogenic therapy (usually regarded as a form of cancer therapy) is based on: inhibitory effects of proangiogenic ligands and their receptors; stimulation or delivery of angiogenesis inhibitors; direct destruction of neoplastic tumor vasculature.","809":"Osteoporosis is a growing problem in an ageing society. It affects women of post-menopausal age, as well as elderly subjects of both sexes, often with dysfunction of the cardiovascular system or with an increased risk of circulation disorders. It has been found that the mortality rate of subjects with osteoporosis is comparable to that of patients suffering from such diseases as obturative pulmonary disease or myocardial ischaemia. Bisphosphonates are the most thoroughly studied group of drugs prescribed for the treatment of osteoporosis. Their administration is, however, associated with a risk of adverse symptoms, which can occur as gastro-intestinal tract disturbances, muscular-osseous pains, mandible necrosis, atypical fractures and other symptoms. Recently, there has been discussion about an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in bisphosphonate-using female patients. This paper focuses on this particular problem, while summing up the actual status of knowledge regarding possible associations of bisphosphonates with cardiac rhythm disturbances.","810":"The paper concerns osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). It is a rare but serious clinical condition. It can develop in patients treated in oncologic doses with bisphosphonates but also with denosumab. In osteoporosis ONJ seems to be very rare. Definition, pathogenesis, risk factors, prevention and treatment, and the frequency of ONJ are presented.","811":"Anorexia nervosa (AN) has in recent years become considerably more common. The disease primarily affects girls and young women, also boys and young men. AN is a risk factor for secondary osteoporosis. AN-related metabolic disturbances lead to diminished bone quality and increased risk of fractures. The consequences of low energy fractures are the main causes of death in women with AN. Hormonal disturbances (e.g. hypoestrogenism, increased levels of ghrelin and Y peptide, changes in leptin and endocannabinoid levels), as well as the mechanisms involved in bone resorption (RANK\/RANKL\/OPG system), are considered to be of great importance for anorectic bone quality. The risk for osteoporotic, non-vertebral fractures in AN patients is significantly higher than in healthy women. Improvement of bone mineral density is possible after substantial body mass increase. Weight loss, in conjunction with a well-balanced, controlled diet, is the key to correct peak bone mass levels, and diminishes the risk for osteoporosis with its consequence of low energy bone fractures.","812":"This article presents the role of the hypothalamus in reproduction, the definition of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), and the causes of acquired and syndromic HH and idiopathic HH (IHH). The authors present a short review of major causes of acquired HH, but most of the causes of IHH will not be discussed because they do not fall within the scope of the article. More attention is devoted to idiopathic HH, especially the genetic basis of IHH. Also presented in the article are clinical criteria of CHARGE syndrome. Later, the article discusses the clinical presentation, establishing the diagnosis, and management of IHH. The article ends with a brief overview of nutritional hypothalamic dysfunction and athletic amenorrhea.","813":"In the majority of cases, acromegaly is sporadic. However, it can also occur in a familial setting as a component of MEN-1, MEN-4, Carney complex (CNC) or as the extremely rare syndrome of isolated familial somatotropinoma (IFS), the latter belonging to familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA). The diagnosis of IFS is based on the recognition of acromegaly\/gigantism in at least two family members, given that the family is not affected by MEN-1, MEN-4 or CNC. The authors present a case study of two sisters: a 56 year-old patient (case no. 1) and a 61 year-old patient (case no. 2). In both sisters, acromegaly was recognised in the course of pituitary macroadenoma. Neither of the sisters showed features of MEN-1, MEN-4 or Carney complex. The authors suppose that the presented cases are manifestations of IFS. However, this diagnosis has not been confirmed yet because of the poor availability of genetic tests.","814":"We present a case of MEN 2B diagnosed in a 23 year-old patient on the basis of bilateral pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma. This young male patient also had multiple paragangliomas located along the spine, marfanoid features of body habitus and numerous mucosal neuromas of the oral cavity and intestinal ganglioneuromatosis. The patient was hospitalised several times between the ages of 11 and 14 due to heart rhythm disorders (tachycardia, multiple supraventricular beats) and pain in the precardiac area. Elevated blood pressure was not observed at that time. In 2010, the patient was admitted to hospital due to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and hypertension; bilateral adrenal tumours were then detected. The patient was referred to the Department of Endocrinology in Szczecin, with suspected pheochromocytoma in order to continue the diagnostic process. This resulted in the diagnosis of bilateral pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma. On the basis of the whole clinical picture, the diagnosis of MEN 2B was established and subsequently confirmed with genetic test results. Following the removal of adrenal tumours and thyroidectomy, the patient was referred to the Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in Gliwice for further treatment (X-ray therapy and further surgery due to recurrence of medullary carcinoma). This article presents a case of late MEN 2B diagnosis despite the presence of clinical symptoms suggestive of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia observed from early childhood.","815":"Puberty is a critical bone mineralisation period, and peak bone mass attained by adolescent girls is one of the most significant predictive factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Adolescent girls' peak bone mass depends on genetic factors as well as on general condition, nutritional status and body mass; lifestyle is also important, along with physical exercise and the use of prescription drugs. Additionally, hormones, including oestrogens, play an important role during pubertal accumulation of bone mass. Therefore, oestrogen deficiency during puberty has serious consequences for bone mineralisation. During puberty, particularly during the initial years after menarche, hypothalamic dysfunction can develop due to psycho-emotional burden, excessive physical exercise or increasing number of responsibilities; psychologists refer to this period as the \"crisis of adolescence\". Its symptoms include behavioural disorders and juvenile depression, both affecting the hypothalamic neurosecretion to an extent that can be reflected by secondary hypo-oestrogenism and amenorrhea. The administration of oestroprogestagens in the treatment of low bone mineral density and hypo-oestrogenism-associated menstrual disorders results in resumed regular menstrual bleedings and maintains, or even improves, bone mineral density. This observation seems to be important not only in terms of short term clinical applications, but also in the context of the long term prevention of osteoporosis. Consequently, hormonal therapy has to be accompanied by a thorough education of patients and their parents, particularly in terms of proper nutrition and modification of levels of physical activity. Puberty is the optimal time period for modifying environmental factors that are associated with bone mass gain.","816":"Prolactin (PRL) exists in human blood in several molecular forms. Macroprolactin (MaPRL), which most often consists of monomeric PRL and immunoglobulin G, has the highest molecular weight but no biological activity. Immunoassays do not distinguish MaPRL from monomeric PRL, what can lead to an incorrect diagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia. The most commonly used technique to separate the isoforms of PRL is precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Another technique - ultrafiltration - seems to be useful in MaPRL detection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of MaPRL in hyperprolactinaemic patients and to compare the results obtained by precipitation and ultrafiltration. The study was conducted on 120 sera obtained from patients hospitalised in the Department of Clinical Endocrinology, Medical University of Lodz, in whom PRL concentration was above 30 ng\/mL Of these 120 patients, 25 had pituitary adenoma, 52 had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and 43 had idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia (HPRL). Macroprolactin was detected using two methods: precipitation with PEG and ultrafiltration. Concentration of PRL was measured by Immulite 1000 immunoassay (Siemens). We detected a predominance of MaPRL in ten patients (three with macroprolactinoma, three with PCOS and four with HPRL) using precipitation and ultrafiltration. Positive correlation and diagnostic concordance between the results of precipitation and ultrafiltration were noted, especially in the group with functional hyperprolactinaemia. In half of the patients with macroprolactinaemia, and in 12 of the 110 subjects without significant amounts of MaPRL, real PRL concentration was within the reference range. MaPRL is not a significant clinical problem in the studied population. However, in patients with hyperprolactinaemia, especially non-organic, screening for macroprolactinaemia should be performed. The effectiveness of the precipitation and ultrafiltration methods for detecting MaPRL is comparable in functional hyperprolactinaemia, but the usefulness of ultrafiltration in patients with pituitary adenoma requires further examination. ","817":"Several studies have assessed natriuretic peptides in patients with thyroid disorders, and these studies have provided contrasting results. This difference may be partially explained by the presence of concomitant disorders of the cardiovascular system in participants. The study included 101 patients free of any cardiovascular disorder, who, on the basis of plasma levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, were divided into patients with overt hyperthyroidism, patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, patients with overt hypothyroidism, patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and control subjects with normal thyroid profile. Hyperthyroidism was induced either by nodular thyroid disease or by Graves' disease, while hypothyroidism was secondary to autoimmune thyroiditis or surgery. Compared to control subjects, hyperthyroid patients were characterised by higher plasma levels of NT-pro-BNP. This increase was particularly pronounced in cases of overt disease. On the other hand, neither clinical nor subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with any significant changes in this peptide. Plasma levels of NT-pro-BNP did not differ between patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre nor between patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism and hypothyroidism secondary to thyroidectomy. Only L-thyroxine substitutions, but not hyperthyroidism treatment, caused changes in plasma concentration of NT-pro-BNP. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism induce changes of the plasma concentration of NT-pro-BNP. Although both exogenous L-thyroxine and antithyroid drugs restored thyroid function, only the former drug changed plasma NT-pro-BNP content. The thyrometabolic state of a patient should always be taken into consideration when NT-pro-BNP is assessed as a marker of cardiac dysfunction.

The patients were diagnosed with non-functioning (NFT) and functioning adrenal tumours (FT) including pheochromocytoma (PH), Conn's syndrome (CO) and Cushing's (CS) syndrome. A total of 165 LAs were carried out between August 1995 and September 2009 via either the transperitoneal (n = 38) or retroperitoneal (n = 127) approach. The analysed factors included demographic data of patients, the American Association of Anaesthesiology score (ASA), indication for surgery, tumour size and side, intraoperative and postoperative outcome of LA including duration of surgery, blood loss, time until ambulation, length of hospital stay, time until return to normal activity, the complication rate, as well as the conversion rate to open adrenalectomy. There were 111 patients with NFT and 54 with FT. Patients with NFT were significantly older than those with CO (p &lt; 0.05). The mean size of the lesion differed between CO and other adrenal tumours (p &lt; 0.05) as well as between NFT and PH (p &lt; 0.05). All the lesions except aldosteronomas were detected predominantly in the right adrenal gland (p &lt; 0.05). However, despite the different characteristic and clinical disorders related to laparoscopically removed adrenal tumours, the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes did not significantly differ in most cases between the analysed groups of patients. This study shows that LA is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated procedure despite the hormonal activity of the removed lesions. Minimal invasive surgery may be recommended as the 'gold standard' in the treatment of both functioning and non-functioning benign tumours of the adrenal gland.

The potential causes include: poor general health of the patient, heavy burden of the surgery itself and the need for the long-term use of immunosuppression. In addition, the patients are also on numerous other medications, e.g. anti-coagulants, diuretics. Osteoporosis and high risk of fractures have emerged as frequent and devastating complications of the transplantation process. This article provides a review of the current literature on osteoporosis after transplantation, and the treatment options for this serious illness.","827":"Bacterial thyroiditis is a rare disease, and one of which the clinical symptoms and signs are frequently misleading. On the other hand, prompt diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment. We report the case of an 82 year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of steroid treatment who presented with severe odynophagia and dysphagia associated with fever, chills, sore throat and right ear pain. Based on the clinical picture, radiological studies, thyroid cytology, blood and thyroid aspirate culture, suppurative thyroiditis caused by Salmonella enteritidis was diagnosed.

Depending on the disease entity or the degree of its severity, attempts to apply angiogenic and antiangiogenic therapy have being made. Antiangiogenic therapy (usually regarded as a form of cancer therapy) is based on: 1. inhibitory effects of proangiogenic ligands and their receptors; 2. stimulation or delivery of angiogenesis inhibitors; and 3. direct destruction of neoplastic tumour vasculature.","829":"Angiogenesis is an important component of many physiological processes, such as the female sexual cycle, placenta formation, the processes of growth and differentiation of tissues, and reparative processes including wound healing, fracture repair, and liver regeneration. The formation of new blood vessels during angiogenesis and vasculogenesis allows the growth and functioning of multicellular organisms. Pathological angiogenesis most commonly occurs in ischaemic, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Conditions in the pathogenesis of which angiogenesis plays an important role are sometimes labelled angiogenic diseases. To date, a number of pro-and anti-angiogenic factors have been defined. VEGF is the only specific mitogen for endothelial cells. It stimulates their growth and inhibits apoptosis, increases vascular permeability in many tissues, promotes vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. VEGF signalling activity in relation to the cell is dependent on having its specific membrane receptors (Flt-1, KDR, Flt-4). Angiogenesis plays a protective role in ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. Angiogenesis extends life for patients after a stroke. Most of the facts about physiological angiogenesis are derived from studies into liver regeneration as a result of an acute injury or partial hepatectomy. Pathological hepatic angiogenesis occurs in the course of inflammation, fibrosis, hypoxia, and during tumourogenesis. There is interesting data relating to liver steatosis and obesity.","830":null,"831":"Our aim is to identify the relation of leptin, adiponectin and insulin resistance to bone mineral density (BMD) in type 2 diabetic postmenopausal women and compare it with that experienced by nondiabetics. Seventy six postmenopausal female patients were included in the study. Postmenopausal type 2 diabetic (n = 19) and nondiabetic patients (n = 19) with spine and\/or hip BMD T score lower than -2 were included in the study, and postmenopausal type 2 diabetic (n = 20) and nondiabetic women (n = 18) with normal BMD (T score &gt; -1) were selected as control groups. Those receiving therapy for osteoporosis, over the age of 65, those who had a disease and were taking a medication that could affect bone metabolism were excluded. Biochemical tests, as well as leptin, adiponectin and insulin levels, were measured and insulin resistance was calculated using the HOMA test. There was no correlation between low BMD and leptin, adiponectin and insulin resistance. There was only a negative correlation between leptin and femur Ward's triangle BMD. Further large-scale studies must to be performed in order to analyse the effects of leptin, adiponectin and insulin resistance on bone metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients. ","832":"Thyroid autoimmunity has been suggested as a risk factor for atherosclerosis independent of thyroid function in several studies. The aim of this study was to investigate whether thyroid autoimmunity had any effect on hyperlipidaemia, obesity and abdominal obesity independent of thyroid function. 184 premenopausal female patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and 150 healthy premenopausal female volunteers as control group (CG) were included in the study. According to thyroid function status, the patients were divided into three subgroups: overt hypothyroid patients (ohp), subclinical hypothyroid patients (shp) and euthyroid patients (ep). Body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratios, waist circumference (WC), and serum lipid levels of all the participants were determined. These parameters of ep were compared with those of ohp, shp and CG. Relationships among thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid autoantibodies and lipid levels were investigated. There were no significant differences between serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of ohp and ep with HT (P = 0.18, P = 0.07 respectively) and LDL-C levels of ep were higher than those of CG (P = 0.03, P = 0.042, respectively). Although TSH levels did not correlate with serum lipid levels, levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody correlated with triglyceride levels and WCs (r = 0.158; P = 0.013, r = 0.128; P = 0.048 respectively) and negatively correlated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (r = -0.137; P = 0.031). Levels of anti-thyroglobulin antibody also correlated with triglyceride and nonHDL-C levels (r = 0.208; P = 0.007, r = 0.158; P = 0.043 respectively).

","833":"The aim of this study was to assess attendance at the universal screening programme for thyroid function in pregnancy and attempt to evaluate the influence of age, number of past pregnancies, level of education, and place of residence on the attendance. The study was performed by means of a questionnaire. Our study was performed on the basis of an anonymous questionnaire handed out to 543 women aged 16-45 years, on the third day of their puerperal stay in one of five obstetric wards in southern Poland. The questionnaire contained questions about participation in plasma level measurements of TSH, fT4, total T4, thyroid antibodies or thyroid ultrasound scanning at least once in pregnancy. The rate of attendance at any examination of thyroid function among pregnant women was 26.7%. The highest attendance rate (32.7%) was found among women living in provincial capitals or with higher education (41.3%), whereas the lowest was among women who had completed only primary school (11%) and those living in county towns (15%). The number of previous pregnancies did not influence the thyroid screening attendance. Women over 21 years of age participated in this screening programme more frequently (27.1-30%).

The (90)Y-DOTATATE therapeutic activity was calculated per total body surface area up to a total of 7.4 GBq\/m(2) administered in three to five cycles, repeated every four to nine weeks. Before and after the therapy, blood tests for haematology, kidney and liver function, and chromogranin A were performed. Out of 46 (90)Y-DOTATATE treated patients, one died before completing the therapy and 16 died after completing the therapy, among them one due to myocardial infarction. After 12 month follow-up, stabilisation of disease was observed in 47%, partial remission in 31%, and progression in 9% of the 45 patients who completed the therapy. Five patients died before completion of 12 months of follow-up. One of the patients died due to myocardial infarction. In one case, the information after 12 months is incomplete.

Moreover, successful trials of the treatment of NET with cabergoline - D2 agonist, have been reported. These findings increase the interest of investigating RD2 expression in NET. The expression of RD2 was investigated immunohistochemically using the antibody which recognises both short (S) and long (L) isoforms of the receptor in 17 NET samples taken from 15 patients. In 17 NET samples, a positive reaction with the anti-RD2 antibody occurred in 11 cases. In six cases, the localisation of the immunostaining was cytoplasmic and in nine cases it was nuclear. Only in one case was the receptor cell membrane-located, and in two cases the immunoreaction was also localised in the blood vessels walls. The relation between RD2 expression and the grade of malignancy examined by means of Ki-67 antigen expression needs further study. However, preliminary observations indicate that the nuclear localisation of RD2 is linked to higher tumour malignancy. The next investigated question was the co-expression of somatostatin and dopamine receptors. This question seems important because of the perspectives of somatostatin-dopamine chimeras application in NET treatment. In the samples examined by us, RD2 were co-expressed in 5\/10 cases with sstr1, in 3\/10 with sstr2A, in 2\/9 with sstr2B, in 3\/10 with sstr3, and in 5\/10 with sstr5. Dopamine D2 receptors are revealed by means of immunohistochemistry in the majority of NET. They exhibit cytoplasmic and\/or nuclear localisations, the latter being possibly linked to a higher grade of malignancy, and are often co-expressed with somatostatin receptors (mostly with subtypes1 and 5). ","838":"The management of thyroid disorders during pregnancy is one of the most frequently disputed problems in modern endocrinology. It is widely known that thyroid dysfunction may result in subfertility, and, if inadequately treated during pregnancy, may cause obstetrical complications and influence fetal development. The 2007 Endocrine Society Practice Guideline endorsed with the participation of the Latino America Thyroid Association, the American Thyroid Association, the Asia and Oceania Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association, greatly contributed towards uniformity of the management of thyroid disorders during pregnancy and postpartum. Despite the tremendous progress in knowledge on the mutual influence of pregnancy and thyroid in health and disease, there are still important areas of uncertainty. There have been at least a few important studies published in the last 3 years, which influenced the thyroidal care of the expecting mother. It should also be remembered that guidelines may not always be universally applied in all populations with different ethnical, socio-economical, nutritional (including iodine intake) background or exposed to different iodine prophylaxis models. The Task Force for development of guidelines for thyroid dysfunction management in pregnant women was established in 2008. The expert group has recognized the following tasks: development of the coherent model of the management of thyroid dysfunction in pregnant women, identification of the group of women at risk of thyroid dysfunction, who may require endocrine care in the preconception period, during pregnancy and postpartum - that is in other words, the development of Polish recommendations for targeted thyroid disorder case finding during pregnancy, and the development of Polish trimester-specific reference values of thyroid hormones. Comprehensive Polish guidelines developed by the Task Force are to systematize the management of the thyroid disorders in pregnant women in Poland.","839":"Yersiniae enterocolitica, a gram negative rod-like organism, causes terminal ileitis and mesenteric adenitis in adolescents and adults.

Hashimoto's disease (HD), on the other hand, is fairly common. Clinical differentiation between these diseases is often difficult, and the results of diagnostic imaging, laboratory tests and cytology studies are often similar. We report the case of a female patient with Riedel's thyroiditis displaying clinical, laboratory and radiological traits of both diseases. A 44 year-old Caucasian female was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed; the findings were suggestive of an exacerbated chronic inflammatory process. However, a small lymphocyte-derived malignancy could not be ruled out with certainty, and so the patient was referred for elective thyroidectomy. The microscopic features of both specimens did not meet the criteria of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The immunohistochemical studies revealed few scattered B lymphocytes (CD20 positive) and numerous scattered T lymphocytes (CD3 positive). Finally, Riedel's thyroiditis with an intense inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes was diagnosed. Reaching a diagnosis was particularly difficult in this patient, since Riedel's thyroiditis, the fibrosing form of Hashimoto's disease and malignant tumours of the thyroid can show similar traits upon physical and histopathological examination. As the clinical data was indicative of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and there were partial histological criteria of two forms of thyroiditis, namely Hashimoto's and Riedel's, the very rare diagnosis of a combined disease was made. Dense B and T lymphocytes and some plasma cell infiltrates, as well as the destruction of thyroid follicles by fibrosis extending into surrounding tissues, were supportive of the eventual diagnosis. Differentiating between the histopathological and clinical presentation of both diseases in one patient is difficult, primarily due to the partial overlapping of their histopathological traits. In order to avoid a diagnostic error, close cooperation between the endocrinologist and pathologist is mandatory. It is our opinion that in our patient the two diseases existed separately, and their coexistence was most likely coincidental.","841":"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is thought to be a common disease in adults. However, it is a rare endocrine disorder in children and adolescents. We report two cases of primary hyperparathyroidism in children diagnosed at the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes (EU and D) in the Children's Hospital (ChH), Kielce. The clinical course of the disease in these cases was fundamentally dissimilar, which confirms the observation that this rare endocrinopathy in children presents various clinical profiles, leading to diagnostic difficulties. In the first case, the severe course of PHPT was observed with signs suggesting a hypercalcemic crisis. In the second case, the patient was in a good condition with a mild hypercalcemia and symptoms limited to the skeleton, due to early identification of the disease. We believe these cases indicate the significant role of calcemia determination as a screening test in the diagnosis of PHPT, including in children.","842":"Although vitamin deficiencies are uncommon in Poland or other developed countries, many patients take vitamin supplements. Despite the widespread availability of vitamins and the universal belief that vitamins offer health benefits, few publications have addressed their role in the prevention and treatment of thyroid diseases. There is some evidence to suggest that the administration of vitamins with anti-oxidant properties in patients with hyperthyroidism can decrease the severity of clinical symptoms, and that vitamin D supplementation can have a beneficial effect on the bone system for these patients. It has also been suggested that patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases should be periodically screened for vitamin B12 deficiency. There has been no data to support vitamin supplementation in the primary or secondary prevention of thyroid malignancies.","843":"In recent years we have performed more than 1,000 radioimmunoassays of ghrelin and obestatin. In these assays, we have encountered several technological obstacles. Another difficulty was the enormous discrepancy of plasma ghrelin results published by different authors. The aim of this article is to comment on these problems. Not all peptides of the hypothalamus and intestines are present in blood circulation. Several neuropeptides do not cross the blood-brain barrier, and several gastrointestinal peptides are present in extremely low concentrations in the blood. That requires time-consuming and laborious extraction. In these procedures, considerable amounts of peptides may be lost. In addition, these peptides are very unstable and prone to enzymatic degradation. This makes it mandatory to add enzymatic inhibitors to plasma samples. The peptides are also unstable in elevated temperatures, hence the assays should be performed in air-conditioned laboratories and the kits should be transported in proper low temperature conditions. Peptides may appear in several isoforms of different biological activity, but antibodies routinely used in these assays are polyclonal and do not differentiate between these forms. This complicates clinical evaluation of the results. To date, there are no international standards of ghrelin, obestatin or other active peptides, probably because of their extreme instability. Because of technological difficulties, the results of peptide assays performed in different scientific research institutions vary greatly and cannot be compared to each other. This disadvantage may be partially diminished by including samples of healthy subjects in each assay run to check whether the peptide concentrations of the patients differ significantly from that of control subjects.","844":"11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (11-beta-HSD1) in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of rats catalyses the conversion of 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone, a more active glucocorticosteroid. Glucocorticosteroids in WAT stimulate adipocytes differentiation and increase adipocytes size. The aim of this study was to examine the association between expression of 11-beta-HSD1 in the WAT of male and female rats and adipose tissue mass as well as body mass. Perirenal WAT from male and female Wistar rats aged three months, and ovariectomized females of the same age, was used in the study. 11-beta-HSD1 gene expression was assayed in the perirenal WAT of rats by real-time PCR. 11-beta-HSD1 gene expression in the perirenal WAT of male rats was higher than in female rats. The WAT and body mass of male rats was also higher than in females. 11-beta-HSD1 gene expression in the perirenal WAT as well as WAT mass and body mass increased simultaneously after ovariectomy. The results presented in this paper suggest that higher 11betaHSD1 gene expression in the WAT is associated with higher body and adipose tissue mass. Moreover, our results suggest that oestradiol can modulate 11-beta-HSD1 gene expression in the WAT of rats. ","845":"The aim of this study was to compare the ability of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure (PP), fraction PP (PPF) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to predict progression to diabetes in non-diabetic first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 701 non-diabetic FDRs aged 20-70 in 2003 to 2005 were followed through to 2008 for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. At baseline and through follow-ups, participants underwent a standard 75 g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Prediction of progression to type 2 diabetes was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves based upon measurement of PP, MAP, PPF, systolic and diastolic BP. Diabetes developed in 72 participants (10.3%) during the follow-up period. The incidence of type 2 diabetes was 3.4 per 100 person years in men and 4.9 in women. Systolic and diastolic BP and MAP were related to diabetes, but PP and PPF were not. Systolic and diastolic BP and MAP have similar associations with incident diabetes. Areas under the ROC curves were 0.582 for systolic, 0.589 for diastolic, 0.589 for MAP, 0.520 for PP, and 0.468 for PPF. These results indicate that systolic and diastolic BP are as strong as MAP in predicting progression to diabetes. Increased BP may help identify FDRs of patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for diabetes who are candidates for BP control. ","846":"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) describes clustering of obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension and increases risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The 'hypertriglyceridemic waist' phenotype (HTGW) represents a simple approach to identifying individuals with increased risk. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HTGW and MetS in type 2 diabetic patients, and to examine their relation to lipids and blood glucose control. 300 type 2 diabetic patients were analysed, and their history of diabetes, anthropometric measures, measurements of blood pressure (BP), lipids and glycemic control parameters were taken. In type 2 diabetic patients, the prevalence of MetS was 71.0% by the AHA\/NHLBI definition and 75.33% by the IDF definition. The prevalence was 62.58% and 66.45% in men, and 80% and 84.83% in women by the same definitions, respectively. There were 41.33% of patients with HTGW (42.76% among women and 40% among men). There were statistically significant differences of age, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial glucose (PPG) in women with and without MetS according to both definitions, and of total and LDL cholesterol with and without MetS according to AHA\/NHLBI (but not IDF). In men, there were statistically significant differences of total cholesterol and of HbA(1c) with and without MetS according to AHA\/NHLBI (but not IDF). Women with HTGW had higher levels of total and LDL cholesterol, systolic and diastolic BP. Men with HTGW had higher levels of total cholesterol, diastolic BP, HbA(1c), FPG and PPG. Determining MetS or HTGW helps identify those with increased cardiovascular risk. ","847":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the number of women who take multivitamin formulations containing iodine. A 34-question questionnaire was given to 500 women during their puerperal stay in two obstetrics\/gynaecology wards in Krakow. 295 pregnant women (59%) took iodine-containing formulations. 205 pregnant women (41%) took multivitamin preparations without iodine. 49.7% of the women (91 out of 183) who inhabited rural areas and small towns were not supplemented with iodine during pregnancy. Women in Krakow took iodine-containing multivitamin formulations in 61.2% of cases. Women with primary and secondary education did not use iodine supplementation in 48.3% and 50.3% of cases respectively. Women with a university education did not use supplementation in 38.6% of cases. The prevalence of women using iodine-containing multivitamin preparation was similar in each age group. The promotion of iodine supplementation to pregnant women should be augmented at each level of contact with medical staff. Medical staff should be reminded about such promotion at each level of medical care and training (general practitioner, obstetrics\/gynaecology specialist, endocrinologist, postgraduate training). ","848":"The relation between thyroid neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) is controversial. While it is accepted that focal lymphocytic thyroiditis develops secondarily to malignancy, it is not clear whether diffuse lymphocytic thyroiditis has a tendency to develop into thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between CLT and malignant tumours of the thyroid and evaluate the surgical approach to CLT cases. In this study, 917 patients operated on for thyroid diseases were investigated retrospectively. Seventy-seven (8.4%) patients histopathologically diagnosed as having CLT (either non-specific or Hashimoto's thyroiditis) were investigated for any concurrent malignant neoplasm. Fifteen patients in whom CLT and thyroid malignancy were coexisting were included in the study. In the pathological evaluation of 917 cases, malignancy in the thyroid was found in 97 (10.6%) cases. Seventy-seven cases were categorised as CLT. Of these 77, 16 (20.8%) were Hashimoto's thyroiditis (specific CLT) and the other 61 (79.2%) were non-specific CLT. In 15 cases, thyroid malignancy was found to be concurrent with CLT. Of the malignities, nine (60%) were papillary carcinoma, three (20%) medullar carcinoma, one (6.6%) follicular carcinoma, one (6.6%) Hurthle cell carcinoma, and one (6.6%) lymphoma. In our series, the rate of the development of malignancy against the background of CLT was 19.48%, while the rate in the groups without CLT was 9.76%, with a statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.008). CLT cases should be evaluated more carefully in terms of malignancy. If a nodule is detected on thyroiditis, the minimal surgical intervention should be lobectomy. Total thyroidectomy should be considered as preferable to subtotal thyroidectomy because of its many advantages such as controlling thyroiditis, removing the probability of reoperation, and hormonal stability. ","849":null,"850":null,"851":"","852":"Morning hyperglycaemia in diabetic subjects may be caused by the dawn phenomenon, or the Somogyi effect, or poor glycaemic control. The dawn phenomenon occurs when endogenous insulin secretion decreases or when the effect of the exogenous insulin administered to the patient the day before disappears, together with a physiological increase in insulin-antagonistic hormones. The Somogyi effect is present in the case of excessive amounts of exogenous insulin. The dawn phenomenon is more common than the Somogyi effect. To diagnose these phenomena, it is useful to measure plasma glucose levels for several nights between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. or use a continuous glucose monitoring system. Although their treatment differs, the best way of preventing both the dawn phenomenon and the Somogyi effect is an optimal diabetes control with insulin therapy.","853":"Without treatment, Cushing's disease has significant morbidity and mortality. Where a surgical approach may not be feasible, or is refused by the patient, medical therapy becomes the only option. In this case report, we discuss the effects of two years of ketoconazole treatment on diabetes regulation and insulin resistance in a patient reluctant to agree to surgery. A 62 year-old female patient with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus was investigated. Cushing's disease was confirmed by the results of high urine free cortisol level and dexamethasone suppression tests. We discuss the effects of two years of 600 mg\/day ketoconazole treatment on diabetes regulation and insulin resistance in a patient with Cushing's disease reluctant to agree to surgery. This case report illustrates the beneficial long-term effects of 24 months of ketoconazole treatment on the clinical and laboratory findings and also on steroid and glucose metabolism.","854":"Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a rare adrenal tumour causing corticotrophin-independent Cushing's syndrome. It occurs mainly in children and young adults. The histological examination is characterised by small pigmented micronodules on the adrenal cortex. The diagnosis is most often seen in patients with Carney Complex, but it can also occur in isolation. We report a case of Carney Complex that was referred for adrenalectomy. The procedure was uneventful and the patient was well at discharge. The adrenal pathology showed numerous black nodules measuring less than 2mm in diameter. This feature was pathognomonic of primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease.","855":"Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is characterised by delayed puberty and infertility. Congenital HH comprises Kallmann syndrome with hypo-\/anosmia and idiopathic HH (IHH). The genetic origin remains unknown in most cases, but the defective GnRH receptor gene (GNRHR) accounts for a considerable proportion of IHH. Here we describe a pair of siblings diagnosed with IHH. Aged 17 years, the boy was referred because of short stature (162 cm) and overweight (62.5 kg). He presented no signs of puberty, bone age of 14.5 years and insulin resistance. His sister, aged 16 years, also displayed delayed puberty. She was 166 cm tall and weighed 52 kg; her bone age was 12.5 years. Pelvic ultrasonography showed an infantile uterus and fibrous ovaries. In both siblings, serum gonadotropins were extremely low, and non-responsive to GnRH. Testosterone (1.38 nmol\/l) and IGF1 (273 ng\/ml) were decreased in the boy, although the girl did not present IFG1 deficiency. Her serum oestradiol was 10 pg\/ml. MRIs of the hypothalamo-pituitary region and olfactory bulbs revealed them to be normal. The patients' sense of smell was unaltered. Their parents appeared to be first degree cousins. Considering the clinical data and potentially autosomal recessive HH transmission, the GNRHR gene was screened. The siblings turned out to be homozygous for the G416A transition, which had previously been identified in other HH individuals. The parents were heterozygous mutation carriers. The proband, moderately responding to LH, was started on low dose testosterone replacement, and his sister on transdermal oestradiol. Molecular data indicative of GnRH resistance could guide their future therapy should they desire fertility restoration. Further observations of the male patient may provide insights into androgen's influence on body mass, growth and insulin sensitivity.","856":"The hormone leptin is secreted from white adipocytes, and serum levels of leptin correlate with adipose tissue mass. Leptin was first described as acting on the satiety centre in the hypothalamus through specific receptors (ob-R) to restrict food intake and enhance energy expenditure. Leptin plays a crucial role in the maintenance of body weight and glucose homeostasis hrough central and peripheral pathways, including regulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic b cells. Leptin may also directly affect the metabolism and function of peripheral tissues. Leptin has been implicated in causing peripheral insulin resistance by attenuating insulin action, and perhaps insulin signalling, in various insulin-responsive cell types. Research has demonstrated a significant relationship between leptin and insulin, but the mechanisms underlying the changes of leptin induced by insulin, and vice versa, remain to be studied in more detail. Recent data provides convincing evidence that leptin has beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis in mouse models of insulin-deficient type 1 diabetes mellitus. Our study suggests that leptin could be used as an adjunct of insulin therapy in insulin-deficient diabetes, thereby providing an insight into the therapeutic properties of leptin as an anti-diabetic agent. Safety evaluation should include a careful assessment of the effects of this combination therapy on the counterregulatory response to hypoglycaemia. The role of leptin in alpha-cell function has not been studied in detail. Extensive studies will be needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of this therapy.","857":"This study aimed to examine the effects of melatonin supplementation on liver glycogen levels in rats with streptozotocin- induced diabetes and subjected to acute swimming exercise. Eighty Sprague-Dawley type adult male rats were divided into eight groups: Group 1, general control; Group 2, melatonin-supplemented control; Group 3, melatonin-supplemented diabetes; Group 4, swimming control; Group 5, melatonin-supplemented swimming; Group 6, melatonin-supplemented diabetic swimming; Group 7, diabetic swimming; Group 8, diabetic control. Melatonin was supplemented at a dose of 3 mg\/kg\/day intraperitoneally for four weeks. Liver tissue samples were collected and evaluated using a Nikon Eclipse E400 light microscope. All images obtained from the light microscope were transferred to PC medium and evaluated using Clemex PE 3.5 image analysis software. The lowest liver glycogen levels in the study were found in group 4. Liver glycogen levels in groups 3, 6, 7 and 8 (the diabetic groups) were higher than group 4, but lower than those in groups 1 and 2. The lowest liver glycogen levels were obtained in groups 1 and 2. The study indicates that melatonin supplementation maintains the liver glycogen levels that decrease in acute swimming exercise, while induced diabetes prevents this maintenance effect in rats.

The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique for differential diagnosis in comparison with molecular cytogenetics - fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) or traditional PCR analysis and propose a diagnostic approach for patients with KS. Karyotype and PCR analysis in two related patients and other family members were performed, followed by MLPA dosage sensitive analysis. In the proband and his maternal uncle, the PCR allowed the detection of a large deletion within the KAL1 gene, from exon 4 to 14 (c.469-?_6314+?del). The deletion was also diagnosed in three female carriers in the presented family. These results were proved by the MLPA technique. Moreover, we traced the presence of the region located downstream and upstream to the KAL1 gene on Xq22.32. However, FISH analysis failed to reveal any deletion in the critical region for KS. Simultaneously, we report difficulties connected with the PCR technique based on the primers for KAL1 amplification presented in the literature. We designed primers that are specific to the X chromosome and bypass pseudogene KALY amplification. FISH analysis is a convenient screening technique, but in the presented family it failed to detect the deletion. Therefore, in the face of a distinctive manifestation of KS, a subsequent molecular assay should be introduced. The MLPA is a useful technique for differential diagnosis in patients with HH combined with smell impairment. ","863":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the decreased level of thyroid hormones on selected parameters of the oxidation\/reduction balance by assessing the activity of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); the level of antioxidant vitamins (A, C, and E); and the concentration of compounds reacting with thiobarbituric acid (TBARS). Investigations involved 20 Belgian giant rabbits of both sexes. Hypothyroidism was induced by intragastric administration of thiamizole. Before this was done, blood was collected from the ear marginal vein (control group) and then the animals received thiamizole through an intragastric tube at a dose of 2 mg\/kg b.w. for 21 days. Blood was collected again (the experimental group) and the following determinations were performed: - in blood serum, the thyroid hormones T3, T4 and TSH; - vitamin A, C and E blood serum concentrations; - in erythrocytes, the concentration of compounds reacting with TBARS, SOD and GSH-Px. A 21-day exposure of rabbits to thiamazole (2 mg\/kg b.w.\/24 h) resulted in a statistically significant decrease of TBARS, a decrease of SOD and GPH-Px activity and in a statistically insignificant decrease in the level of vitamins A, C and E. Hypothyroidism decreases the level of erythrocytes oxidation\/reduction balance by diminishing oxidative lipids damage and by decreasing the activity of antioxidative enzymes, but not by changes in the level of antioxidant vitamins.

Gynecomastia is characterised by the presence of soft, 2-4 cm in diameter, usually discusshaped enlargement of tissues under the nipple. It is estimated that this pathology occurs in 32-65% of men over the age of 17. Gynecomastia is a psychosocial problem and may lead to a perceived lowering of quality of life. The main cause of gynecomastia is a loss of equilibrium between oestrogens and androgens. Increased sensitivity for oestrogens of the breast gland, or local factors (e.g. an excessive synthesis of oestrogens in breast tissues or changes in oestrogen and androgen receptors) may cause gynecomastia. Also, prolactin, thyroxine, cortisol, human chorionic gonadotropin, leptin and receptors for human chorionic gonadotropin, prolactin and luteinizing hormone localised in tissues of the male breast may participate in the etiopathogenesis of gynecomastia. Usually three types of gynecomastia are distinguished: physiological, idiopathic and pathological gynecomastia. The latter is the consequence of relative or absolute excess of oestrogens. In this paper, frequent as well as casuistic causes of gynecomastia will be described. A diagnosis of gynecomastia is usually possible after a palpation examination. Ultrasonographic, mammographic or histopathological examinations are useful in aiding diagnosis. The five degree scale devised by Tanner and Marshall is useful in estimating disease progression.","867":"We present the case of a female patient with virilising adrenocortical carcinoma treated surgically who conceived during adjuvant treatment with mitotane. We discuss the frequently erroneous routine treatment with oral hormonal contraception without thorough differential diagnosis in female patients with oligo-\/amenorrhea and subsequent delay in the proper diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma.","868":"Cushing's syndrome (also known as hypercortisolemia) is rare in pregnant women due to the menstrual disturbances and infertility in women with hypercortisolism. A diagnosis of pathological hypercortisolism in pregnant women is often difficult as some symptoms of the disease may be associated with a complicated pregnancy. Hypercortisolemia leads to serious complications for mother and foetus, and is associated with premature labour and high foetal mortality. Hormonal and radiological diagnostics in pregnancy are limited. The results of hormonal measurements and dynamic tests are difficult to interpret due to the physiological changes in the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal axis connected with pregnancy. The optimal time and method of treatment should be chosen cautiously case by case because of the possibility of maternal and foetal complications. In this paper, we present a case of Cushing's syndrome secondary to adrenal adenoma in which the diagnosis was made in the 22(nd) week of pregnancy. Due to the advanced gestational status and mild symptoms of hypercortisolism, only symptomatic treatment was introduced. The patient was under continuous obstetric and endocrinological care. At 35 weeks of gestation, the pregnancy was terminated by emergency caesarean section because of premature detachment of the placenta. A male infant weighing 2,450 g was delivered; neither adrenal insufficiency in the child nor hypercortisolemia complications in the mother were observed.","869":"Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (also called Wernicke's encephalopathy) is a potentially fatal, neuropsychiatric syndrome caused most frequently by thiamine deficiency. The three classic symptoms found together are confusion, ataxia and eyeball manifestations. Memory disturbances can also be symptoms. Wernicke's encephalopathy mainly results from alcohol abuse, but also from malnutrition, cancer, chronic dialysis, thyrotoxicosis and, in well-founded cases, encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (EAATD). The coexistence of many factors makes a proper diagnosis difficult, delays appropriate treatment and consequently reduces the chance of complete recovery. We present the case of a 53 year-old female with Wernicke's encephalopathy caused by chronic malnutrition, surgical operation, as well as thyrotoxicosis. She received treatment with intravenous thiamine administration and also anti-thyroid treatment which caused satisfactory regression of her neurological symptoms.","870":"Elevated levels of serum glucose have deleterious effects on the walls of blood vessels, leading to microangiopathy. Such a destructive process involves also pulmonary circulation, where it is referred to as diabetic pulmonary microangiopathy. This hypothesis has been confirmed in histopathologic examinations of pulmonary parenchyma, as well as in pulmonary function tests. However, so far there have been no clinical implications of these findings. Another phenomenon requiring further discussion involves diabetics with clinically silent respiratory dysfunction. That may result from significant vascular and ventilation reserves that compensate for partial loss of pulmonary parenchyma in the course of diabetes. In this review, we present an overview of the available publications on pulmonary microangiopathy and its influence on the functioning of the respiratory system.","871":"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is a process in which noncoding regions of primary transcript are removed and coding regions are joined in different manners to produce mRNA molecules of different sequences. Alternative splicing affects nearly all human genes and is a key source of diversity of proteins coded by a relatively small number of genes. Since alternative splicing is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of cells, including those involved in hormonal signalling, aberrations of alternative splicing can lead to disruption of cellular mechanisms and in consequence result in serious endocrine pathologies. Disturbances of alternative splicing include mutations of consensus splice regulatory sites and improprieties in the action of splicing factors, the proteins involved in regulating the process. In consequence of disturbed alternative splicing, improperly spliced mRNA and protein isoforms can be produced which can lead to disruption of function of their wild type counterparts. This review aims to discuss the role of alternative splicing in pathologies of the endocrine system and gives examples that highlight the importance of this process in the proper functioning of hormones, hormone receptors and other factors involved in hormonal regulation. The examples given include endocrine-related tumours (pituitary tumours, cancers of the thyroid, prostate, ovary and breast, and insulinoma), isolated growth hormone deficiency, and Frasier syndrome. Non-endocrine pathologies in which aberrant alternative splicing of transcripts of genes involved in hormonal signalling have been detected are also described. Finally, we discuss future perspectives on the possible usage of alternative splicing in diagnostics and therapy.","872":null,"873":"The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of nutritional habits and addictions in the incidence of thyroid carcinoma. The study of risk factors affecting the incidence of thyroid carcinoma was conducted in patients included in a register of thyroid carcinoma. For that purpose, a questionnaire was prepared. The questionnaire covered: personal information, medical history, individual risk factors of thyroid carcinoma such as nutritional habits, alcohol consumption and smoking. Statistical analysis was conducted. The register comprised 297 patients with thyroid carcinoma (89% women) and 589 healthy subjects. 46% of patients declared frequent consumption of milk and dairy products. The patients with thyroid carcinoma consumed cruciferous plants significantly more often than healthy subjects (p = 0.0001) whereas egg consumption among both groups of patients was similar. Low consumption of fish and average table salt consumption was typical of both groups. Alcohol consumption was similar in both groups and was, respectively, 42.18% and 47.59%. The patients with thyroid cancer smoked less frequently than subjects from the control group. Logistic regression analysis showed that carcinoma risk increased in patients who consumed cruciferous vegetables (brassicas). Their regular intake was related to a 1.5-fold (CI 1.19-1.96) higher risk of thyroid carcinoma incidence. Despite the demonstrated decreased risk of thyroid cancer, smoking (OR 0.54) was not considered a protective factor. 1.

Anthropometric, hormonal (testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA-S, LH, FSH) parameters and SHBG were assessed in all subjects. Mean testosterone and DHEA-S levels were higher in sisters of women with PCOS than in the control women. In eight of the 44 (18.2%) sisters, a diagnosis of PCOS was made. Mean testosterone and androstenedione levels, and free androgen index (FAI) were significantly higher in sisters with PCOS compared to the sisters without PCOS. Brothers of women with PCOS had higher DHEA-S level than the control men. Eleven of the 42 (26.2%) brothers had alopecia occurring before the age of 30. Prematurely balding brothers did not differ from the non-balding brothers in hormonal parameters. Siblings of women with PCOS are predisposed to hormonal abnormalities typical of PCOS. The symptom of premature balding under the age of 30 in brothers of women with PCOS should not be considered as a male PCOS equivalent.

It has been found that the mortality rate of subjects with osteoporosis is comparable to that of patients suffering from such diseases as obturative pulmonary disease or myocardial ischaemia. Bisphosphonates are the most thoroughly studied group of drugs prescribed for the treatment of osteoporosis. Their administration is, however, associated with a risk of adverse symptoms, which can occur as gastro-intestinal tract disturbances, muscular-osseous pains, mandible necrosis, atypical fractures and other symptoms. Recently, there has been discussion about an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in bisphosphonate-using female patients. This paper focuses on this particular problem, while summing up the actual status of knowledge regarding possible associations of bisphosphonates with cardiac rhythm disturbances.","881":"This review looks at osteonecrosis in the stomatognathic system (mainly the jaws). Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a rare but serious clinical condition. It affects patients treated with bisphosphonates, and also with denosumab, mainly in oncological doses.

In a description of a few series of cases, fractures of typical clinical course and radiological image have been documented. These fractures are estimated as very rare (2.3 per 10,000 patient-years). It is suggested that a subsequent use of steroids or proton pump inhibitors with bisphosphonates may increase the risk of fracture occurrence.","883":"Denosumab is the international name of a human, monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. This antibody is associated with RANK ligand (RANKL), inactivating it. In consequence, the formation and survival of osteoclasts are suppressed, leading to their apoptosis. All this results in lower bone resorption, while bone mineral density (BMD) increases. Denosumab also reduces the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. This agent is similarly effective in various stages of renal function impairment; it does not impair fracture healing processes nor contribute to atherosclerosis progression in patients with high cardiovascular risks. Following an analysis of adverse effects, performed in the FREEDOM study (in which it was demonstrated that the incidence of the majority of adverse effects observed in the course of denosumab use was similar to that in the placebo group), its safety for patients can definitely be confirmed.","884":"Most medical agents currently applied in osteoporosis therapy act by inhibiting bone resorption and reducing bone remodelling, i.e. they inhibit the process of bone mass loss by suppressing bone resorption processes. These drugs provide an ideal therapeutic option to prevent osteoporosis progression. They however have a rather limited usefulness when the disease has already reached its advanced stages with distinctive bone architecture lesions. The fracture risk reduction rate, achieved in the course of anti-resorptive therapy, is insufficient for patients with severe osteoporosis to stop the downward spiral of their quality of life (QoL) with a simultaneously increasing threat of premature death. The activity of the N-terminal fragment of 1-34 human parathormone (teriparatide - 1-34 rhPTH), a parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogue obtained via genetic engineering , is expressed by increased bone metabolism, while promoting new bone tissue formation by stimulating the activity of osteoblasts more than that of osteoclasts. The anabolic activity of PTH includes both its direct effect on the osteoblast cell line, and its indirect actions exerted via its regulatory effects on selected growth factors, e.g. IGF-1 or sclerostin. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the actual anabolic effects of PTH remain mostly still unclear. Clinical studies have demonstrated that therapeutic protocols with the application of PTH analogues provide an effective protection against all osteoporotic fracture types in post-menopausal women and in elderly men with advanced osteoporosis. Particular hopes are pinned on the possibility of applying PTH in the therapy of post-steroid osteoporosis, mainly to suppress bone formation, the most important pathological process in this regard. The relatively short therapy period with a PTH analogue (24 months) should then be replaced and continued by anti-resorptive treatment.","885":"Strontium ranelate is one of the first-line agents with proven anti-fracture activity used in the therapy of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Its mechanism of action makes it, however, different from other drugs, since it simultaneously stimulates two reverse processes: bone formation and bone resorption. The action of the agent depends on various mechanisms, including the activation of calcium receptors, localised on osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and on the influence on the OPG\/RANKL system. The drug effectively prevents spinal, hip and extravertebral fractures. The agent's anti-fracture efficacy within the spine does not depend on the patient's age, or on base BMD values, or on the concentration of bone metabolism markers. As to the anti-fracture efficacy in the hip, it concerns women with an increased bone fracture risk. Strontium ranelate increases bone mineral density within the lumbar spine and the hip, decreases the concentrations of bone resorption markers, and increases the concentrations of bone formation markers. The drug is administered in a daily 2.0 g oral dose. This paper presents indications to therapy with strontium ranelate, specifying also its side effects and contraindications. We compare the anti-fracture efficacy of strontium ranelate to the efficacy of other agents of proven anti-fracture activity, based on published clinical studies.","886":"In developed societies, the post-menopausal period covers approximately one third of a woman's life. The deficit of oestrogens observed during the post-menopausal period significantly affects the course of many metabolic processes, causing a number of diseases and in consequence diminishing quality of life. Among others, bones belong to oestrogen-dependent tissues. The deficit of the protective influence of oestrogens compromises the dynamic balance of the bone transformation process towards resorption, thus reducing bone mass and quality, while increasing the risk of low-energy fractures. In recent years, differing views on the application of oestrogen\/gestagen therapy have reached the level of controversy. The results of numerous clinical studies are far from unequivocal, with the whole subject one of heated debate. It has been confirmed that hormonal therapy prevents bone quality deterioration, while opening a protective umbrella around the bone, reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures. A rational approach to weighing possible advantages against possible risks and a thorough evaluation of a patient's health condition allows for optimal therapy selection.","887":"Osteoporosis is a chronic disease of the osseous system characterised by decreased strength of bone tissue, which in turn leads to increased fracture risk. It has been demonstrated that osteoporosis affects more than 30% of women after the menopause (WHO, 1994). However, the disease is also observed in men. The primary goals of osteoporosis therapy include prevention of low-energy fractures and general improvement of quality of life. Any patient with diagnosed osteoporosis requires, besides prevention, the application of proper treatment. Of the available therapeutic options, the best are bisphosphonates, medical agents with well identified properties, therapeutic efficacy, and safety which has been confirmed in many clinical studies. Therefore, they are recommended as first line drugs for osteoporosis. The efficacy of oral preparations may be limited, due to low bioavailability, complications and adverse effects from the gastrointestinal tract. So the parenteral administration of bisphosphonates is a valuable alternative. A fine example of such therapy is the intravenous administration of ibandronate. Short injection time periods and the relatively long, three-month intervals between administrations are unquestionable advantages of this therapy mode. In addition, the therapy does not constrain a patient's everyday activity, and simultaneously provides regular contact with doctors and the therapeutic centre. Additionally, a good tolerance of the drug and its high therapeutic efficacy, proven by appreciably reduced fracture risks, significantly improves the quality of life of patients suffering from osteoporosis. This paper is a thorough review of current knowledge on the efficacy and safety of i.v. ibandronate in osteoporosis therapy, as presented in the latest literature reports.","888":"Loss of bone mineral density and fractures in patients after stroke are among the most serious health complications. Regarding serious post-stroke impediments, significantly contributing to elevated fracture incidence are falls. An increasing number of subjects after stroke have been observed and better understanding of the nature of skeletal changes might improve the efficacy of their management. The most important issues in post-stroke patients include an evaluation of bone loss magnitude, the occurrence of falls, fracture incidence and prevention procedures. An early start of pharmacological treatment plus exercise are recommended procedures in the early post-stroke stages, in order to diminish as much as possible subsequent bone loss, the direct consequences of which may include hemiosteoporosis, prolonged immobilisation, further falls and fractures.","889":"Anorexia nervosa (AN) has in recent years become considerably more common. The disease primarily affects girls and young women, and also boys and young men. AN is a risk factor for secondary osteoporosis. AN-related metabolic disturbances lead to diminished bone quality and increased risk of fractures. The consequences of low energy fractures are the main causes of death in women with AN. Hormonal disturbances (e.g. hypoestrogenism, increased levels of ghrelin and Y peptide, changes in leptin and endocannabinoid levels), as well as the mechanisms involved in bone resorption (RANK\/RANKL\/OPG), are considered to be of great importance for anorectic bone quality. The risk of osteoporotic, non-vertebral fractures in AN patients is significantly higher than in healthy women. An improvement of bone mineral density is possible after substantial body mass increase. Weight loss, in conjunction with a well-balanced, controlled diet, is the key to correct peak bone mass levels, and diminishes the risk of osteoporosis with its consequence of low energy bone fractures. (Pol J Endocrinol 2011; 62 (1): 45-47).","890":"Steroid-induced osteoporosis is a textbook example of the secondary type of this medical condition. Glucocorticosteroids suppress bone formation by their direct and indirect effect on osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes, increasing their resorption and, eventually, leading to negative bone balance. A clinical problem arises regarding the fact that approximately 50% of patients on chronic steroid therapy undergo asymptomatic bone fractures. The treatment mode includes minimising the dose of administered steroids, encouraging an improved lifestyle and supplementation with adequate calcium and vitamin D3 doses. Bisphosphonates are a group of medical agents used both to prevent and treat steroid-induced osteoporosis, although new therapies have also become available in recent years.","891":"Epidemiological prognoses regarding the global spread of post-menopausal osteoporosis can prove somewhat nebulous. But it is clear that low-energy fractures and their consequences will become an increasingly serious health problem. Therefore it is crucial to implement prognostic procedures which could more effectively predict the incidence of osteoporosis and its complications. The study involved 378 female patients aged 40-86 years for whom clinical risk factors of osteoporotic fracture were analysed. Densitometry (DPX) was performed at femoral neck. The 10-year risk of fracture was assessed according to the British model of FRAX calculator. The study group was divided into two, depending on the history of low-energy fractures. Previous osteoporotic fractures were confirmed in 128 patients. In this group, the mean bone mineral density (BMD) values (0.717 g\/cm(2)) were lower than in the group without fracture history (0.735 g\/cm(2)). In 33.3% of patients aged 50-59 years and 17% of women aged 60-79 who required medical treatment for their clinical status (previous fracture), the FRAX value did not meet the criterion of pharmacotherapy administration. Considering BMD in the calculation of FRAX produced an even higher underestimation of the fracture risk. Of women aged 40-49, 25% were qualified for pharmacotherapy of osteoporosis. In that particular age category, BMD did not affect the FRAX value. BMD measurement had a higher discriminatory value among patients aged 50-79, increasing the number of patients requiring therapy by more than 50%. 1. The FRAX calculator does not always consider the history of low-energy fractures as a criterion sufficient for therapy implementation. 2. Designing a FRAX calculator specifically for the Polish population would be advisable.

The study was carried out in a cohort of 1,122 otherwise healthy women with no history of previous fractures. We showed a gradual decline of BMD and BMC with age, and the presence of suspected correlations of densitometric results with age and selected anthropometric parameters. Our study confirmed the utility of densitometric screening using forearm SXA measurements. These measurements discriminated clearly between pre- and post-menopausal subjects. Densitometric results correlated negatively with age and age at menopause, but positively with anthropometric indices related to body and skeletal size.

Besides the development of surgical techniques and introduction of laparoscopic method as a routine operating treatment of adrenal lesions, also other factors like a development of the endocrinological and imaging diagnosis together with the knowledge of etiology and understanding of hormonal interactions of the arenal glands have contributed to it. Based on experience of the Department of General, Vascular and Transplant surgery WUM where between 1997-2009 711 adrenalectomies were carried out (529 laparoscopic and 182 classical) current methods of adrenal operation, qualifications and indications were presented. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy confirming it's safety and benefits has gained the approval of the medical fraternity and became the main method of surgical treatment. 1.

However, its interpretation may be influenced by many factors such as stress, alcohol, failure to ingest the dexamethasone, altered metabolism, drug interaction and obesity. This report illustrates such an instance, whereby the result of the test was erratic due to the anti-tuberculous drug rifampicin. Rifampicin has been found to profoundly attenuate the biological effects of dexamethasone, probably by enhancing its metabolism in the liver. The exact mechanism of the drug interaction remains elusive, though induction of hepatic CYP3A4 enzyme complex is a possible mechanism. In a patient treated with rifampicin, the results of dexamethasone suppression tests thus have no diagnostic value and can be very misleading.","902":"Many important biochemical mechanisms are activated in the presence of high levels of glucose, which occur in diabetes. Large randomised studies have established that early intensive glycaemic control reduces the risk of diabetic complications. This phenomenon has recently been dubbed 'metabolic memory'. It has been suggested that early glycaemia normalisation can halt the hyperglycaemia-induced pathological processes associated with enhanced oxidative stress and glycation of cellular proteins and lipids. The phenomenon of metabolic memory suggests that early aggressive treatment and strict glycaemic control could prevent chronic diabetic complications.","903":null,"904":null,"905":"It has been suggested that adipose tissue hormones are involved in the mechanism of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Very little is known as to whether the action on resistin contributes to the clinical effectiveness associated with the use of these agents. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of plasma- and tissue-type ACE inhibitors (enalapril and perindopril) on plasma resistin content in coronary artery disease (CAD) individuals without arterial hypertension. The samples used in our analysis were obtained at baseline, and again after 30 and 90 days of treatment, from 22 patients receiving enalapril (20 mg\/d), 24 receiving perindopril (4 mg\/d), 20 receiving no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and 20 healthy subjects. Each group consisted of patients sensitive and resistant to insulin. Plasma resistin content was higher in normotensive CAD patients, particularly in the subgroup with reduced insulin sensitivity, than in the control group. Both ACE inhibitors produced a weak effect on blood pressure. Perindopril treatment reduced resistin levels, while enalapril only tended to decrease its content. The effect of perindopril was stronger in insulin-resistant than in insulin-sensitive subjects. Our results demonstrate the superiority of perindopril over enalapril in reducing plasma resistin levels, particularly in insulin-resistant subjects. They justify the choice of a tissue-type ACE inhibitor in normotensive CAD individuals, requiring administration of this group of agents.

Our study was into risk factors affecting the incidence of thyroid carcinoma conducted in patients included in a register of thyroid carcinoma. For that purpose, a questionnaire was prepared which covered personal information, medical history and socio-economic factors. A statistical analysis was conducted. The register comprised 297 patients (89% female) with thyroid carcinoma and 589 healthy subjects. Age group distribution was similar for both groups. The largest group was aged 50-54. The number of children born to women with carcinoma and women in the control group did not differ significantly. 10% of the women with carcinoma had used contraception. Patients were most frequently born in Olsztyn province, an area of relative iodine deficiency. 9.72% had suffered from thyroid disease in childhood. 32.41% had a family history of thyroid disease. Mothers of patients most frequently also came from regions of similar iodine level. The fathers most frequently came from Warsaw province (17.08%). The origin of the remainder was the same as of the mothers. 36% of patients had elementary, 14% vocational, 38% secondary and 13% higher education. Logistic regression showed that the risk of carcinoma increased 0.98 times in each person younger by a year.

Two cases of advanced breast cancer with thyroid metastases in female patients are presented. The similarities between these two cases included: 1) postmenopausal age; 2) diagnosis based on result of FNAB (numerous groups of cells with epithelial phenotype strongly implying metastatic breast cancer); 3) thyroid function - overt hyperthyroidism in the first woman and subclinical hyperthyroidism in the second one; 4) the presence of nodular goitre in clinical examination, the occurrence of many nodular solid normoechogenic lesions with calcifications in both thyroid lobes in US; and 5) negative antithyroid antibodies. The main difference was the time of establishing diagnosis; in the first woman - before mammectomy, parallel to diagnostics of breast tumour, and in the second woman four years after mammectomy, during cancer dissemination (with right pleural effusion and lung metastasis). In the first case, mammectomy was followed two weeks later by thyroidectomy. The second patient was disqualified from thyroid surgery due to systemic metastatic disease. 1. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid gland should obligatorily be performed in patients with breast cancer and nodular goitre, even without any clinical data of metastatic disease. 2.

By activating a lot of cell substrates, it can regulate the cell cycle, demonstrates suppressive effects, and participates in the senescence and apoptosis processes. Mutations in the CHEK2 gene are associated with increased risk of numerous cancers. The case described herein is that of a woman with a missense mutation that results in the substitution of isoleucine for threonine at position 157. This variant of the mutation doubles the risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma two times and causes up to 9% of these cancer. It is also associated with a two-fold increased risk of cancers of the kidney (10%), colon (10%), and ovary (10% - G1), a 1.6-fold increased risk of prostate cancer (8% of all of them and 12% of familiar ones), and a 1.5-fold increased risk of breast cancer (7%). The screening procedures were initiated in a carrier who revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma. Genetic screening of the family diagnosed her daughter as the carrier of this mutation. Until now no active cancer disease has been recognized in the daughter. On the example of the presented case we discuss indications for screening in cases of positive family history. The group especially predisposed seem to be patients with at least two coexisting carcinomas. Having diagnosed the mutation, it is necessary to do genetic screening of family members.

The treatment, including total thyroidectomy and complementary radioiodine (RAI) therapy, gives complete remission in 90% of patients. However, in 10% of subjects with metastatic disease, the prognosis is poor. In the group of patients with disease progression and no 131I uptake, searching for new therapeutic modalities before all tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other antiangiogenic agents is necessary. The study presents the case of a 55-year-old male with advanced PTC \/pT3mNxMo\/ diagnosed in 1993. Primary treatment by total thyroidectomy and 131I ablation led to complete remission. In 2000 local as well as lymph node recurrence was diagnosed and successively treated by surgery. In 2006 an increasing serum thyroglobulin level was noted and a single lung metastasis was diagnosed and operated on. In 2007 new foci in CNS and vertebral column with no 131I uptake were stated. Further progression (bones, CNS, and pterygoid muscle) was confirmed by PET-CT. The patient underwent neurosurgical metastasectomy twice and palliative CNS and vertebra's radiotherapy. Liver metastases were diagnosed in 2009. Treatment with increasing doses of thalidomide (up to 800 mg\/d) was administered for 3 months with a good tolerance; however, the therapy was withdrawn due to cancer progression. Next, sorafenib (800 mg\/d) was given for 16 weeks. Radiological examination performed after 16 weeks confirmed stable disease, whereas 2 months later, after sorafenib withdrawal due to lack of treatment possibility, further progression was observed. Metronomic chemotherapy with Adriamycin was instituted which gave disease stabilization for 6 months. The patient died with advanced disseminated disease due to pulmonary embolism. We present this case to document no adverse effects of therapy with sorafenib in a patient with brain DTC metastases. Sorafenib therapy was only short-term, but no progression occurred in this time.","918":"Approximately 5% of differentiated thyroid cancers are hereditary. Hereditary non-medullary thyroid cancer may occur as a minor component of familial cancer syndromes (e.g. familial adenomatous polyposis) or as a primary feature (familial non-medullary thyroid cancer [FNMTC]). Among FNMTC, PTC is the most common. Although a hereditary predisposition to non-medullary thyroid cancer is well established, the susceptibility genes are poorly known.

From a group of 186 patients who entered on record in 1999, 167 were qualified for this analysis. Similarly, from 238 patients registered in 2008, finally 226 were added. We analyzed: sex, age at diagnosis, histotype of thyroid cancer, and DTC staging according to TNM (UICC 2002). In 1999 there were 137 females (82.04 %) and 30 males (17.93%) with thyroid cancer diagnosed at ages 5-81 years. In 2008 there were 183 females (80.97%) and 43 males (19.03%) diagnosed at ages 14-80 years. In both groups, in 1999 and 2008, the median age was the same (51 years). In the year 1999, 119 (71%) and in 2008, 197 (87%) patients were diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer (p = 0.0003). Relations between age and sex were similar in these years.

Forty-three serum samples, obtained from 40 patients (6 MTC active disease patients, 23 MTC patients in remission, and 11 NTNG patients), were tested for calcitonin and procalcitonin levels. The levels of both markers were measured in 2 MTC patients with active disease before and after surgery. One was re-operated due to neck relapse, the other one due to liver metastases. Both procalcitonin and calcitonin levels were considerably higher in all MTC patients with the active disease. In two re-operated patients, the levels of both markers decreased after surgery but remained above the reference range.

Preoperative diagnostic procedure consisted of thyroid scintigraphy, thyroid ultrasonography, and cytology of the material obtained through FNA. In addition, the hormonal activity of the thyroid gland was examined. The range of operation was established through clinical assessment of the tumour, preoperative cytology, and intra-operative histopathology. Among 7 patients with thyroid metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma, as diagnosed postoperatively, cytology of the thyroid material obtained through FNA revealed follicular tumour in 3 (43%) patients, tumour cells in 2 (28.5%) and atypical cells in the other 2 (28.5%). Intraoperative histopathology confirmed the presence of metastasis from renal clear cell carcinoma (1) and indicated thyroid medullary cancer (1), follicular tumour (4), or trabecular adenoma with necrosis (1). Among two patients with thyroid metastases from breast cancer, cytology confirmed a metastasis from breast cancer in one (the woman was disqualified for surgical treatment) and indicated follicular tumour in one. Intraoperative histopathology suggested thyroid anaplastic cancer. Examination of biopsy specimen revealed epithelial cells accompanied by cell atypia in one patient with thyroid metastasis from lung cancer. Intra-operative examination also indicated cellular atypia in the same patient.

Most patients with endocrine disorders present with diffuse non-scarring alopecia, such as anagen effluvium, telogen effluvium or androgenetic alopecia. Focal non-scarring alopecia, such as alopecia areata coexisting with autoimmune thyroiditis, is less frequent and scarring alopecia is a rare finding in patients with endocrine abnormalities. In some cases an endocrine disorder may be suspected based on dermatological findings during hair loss evaluation. Classic methods of hair evaluation include hair weighing, pull test, wash test, the trichogram, and histopathological examination.

Progress in this area has already been transformed into many practical proposals which are improving clinical practice.","936":null,"937":"Vitamin D is essential for the maintenance of good health, and vitamin D deficiency has been reported from many countries, including those with a lot of sunshine. This study was conducted to evaluate the vitamin D status in healthy 6- to 7-year-old children in Isfahan, Iran. Five hundred and thirteen healthy children were enrolled. Serum PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) were measured. Dietary vitamin D intake, duration of daily sunlight exposure, and percentage of exposed body surface area were determined. 25-OHD levels &lt; 20 ng\/mL and &lt; 10 ng\/mL were defined as mild and severe vitamin D deficiency, respectively. The ROC curve was utilized to obtain a local cut-off point of vitamin D deficiency. 25-OHD was &lt; 20 ng\/mL in 3% and &lt; 33 ng\/mL (local cut-off point of vitamin D deficiency) in 26% of subjects. Duration of sunlight exposure and daily intake of vitamin D had significant effects on serum level of vitamin D. A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Isfahan children was observed in this study. Improvements in duration of sunlight exposure and daily intake of vitamin D can prevent vitamin D deficiency in these children.

Firstly to assess the interaction between insulin resistance and ghrelin levels in hypogonadal men, and then to show the effects of testosterone (T) therapy on insulin and ghrelin. Twenty-four male patients newly diagnosed with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and 20 healthy male subjects were enrolled in this study. Ghrelin, insulin, glucose, total and free testosterone levels, HOMA-IR and QUICKI, and percentage of body fat mass were determined at baseline in all subjects and after therapy in hypogonadal men. When compared with control subjects, hypogonadal men had significantly lower total and free T concentrations, ghrelin levels, and QUICKI whereas they had significantly higher body fat mass and HOMA-IR score. Following T therapy, a significant increase in ghrelin and QUICKI, and a decrease in HOMA-IR score and body fat mass were demonstrated in hypogonadal men. Calculation of the Pearson coefficient showed that ghrelin concentrations in hypogonadal men were positively correlated with free and total testosterone and QUICKI, whereas they were negatively correlated with body fat mass and HOMA-IR. After six months of T therapy, these correlations were still observed. Our data supports the notion that ghrelin may constitute an important link between the regulation of reproduction and metabolic homeostasis. ","942":"Chromogranin A (CgA) is regarded as a major, nonspecific marker of neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Its estimation appears helpful for diagnostic purposes and is particularly useful for monitoring the treatment of NET. It must be kept in mind, however, that various factors, drugs, or coexisting diseases may influence the outcome of CgA measurement in blood. One such analytical factor is the sort of studied biological material, whether it is plasma or serum. The aim of our study was to compare directly the results of CgA concentrations measured in serum and in plasma by IRMA and ELISA. We analysed 122 samples of EDTA-plasma and 122 samples of serum by IRMA method, 20 samples of EDTAplasma and 20 samples of serum by IRMA and ELISA, 25 heparinised-plasma samples and 25 samples of EDTA-plasma by IRMA and ELISA methods, and 8 EDTA-plasma, heparinised-plasma, and serum samples by IRMA and ELISA. The material for comparative study was obtained during the same blood collection from the same subjects (volunteers and patients with NET). CgA was measured with the use of kits manufactured by CIS bio International (France). CgA concentrations were markedly higher in plasma than in serum. Using the IRMA method, the difference in the CgA range between 10-100 ng\/mL approached 20-70% (median 61 v. 42), in the range 101-300 ng\/mL--12-60% (median 147 v. 101), and in the CgA range 301-1076 ng\/mL--14-40% (median 486 v. 356). The differences between results in serum and plasma using ELISA were similar but slightly smaller. There was no significant difference between CgA levels in EDTA and heparinised-plasma samples, and the results of measurements performed by IRMA and ELISA in most cases were similar. Referring each individual CgA result to the proposed reference range (or cut-off value) we must take into account whether the measurement is performed in plasma or in serum.

Nowadays, thyroid ultrasound examination has become an essential part of routine thyroid gland evaluation. Although one of the greatest advantages of this examination lies in its simplicity, it requires a solid theoretical background, as well as a lot of experience for the examiner to become fluent in adequate interpretation of its results. The aim of this summary is to present a review of the most important aspects of both the technique and interpretation of thyroid ultrasound pictures with regard to the most common difficulties a thyroid sonographer may come across in everyday practice.","944":"Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) arising from dispersed endocrine system may originate from almost every location, although they are most commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. NETs are considered as particularly rare if they constitute less than 1% of all neuroendocrine tumours. The aim of the paper is to present ten rare NETs from the database of the Endocrinology Department of the Jagiellonian University, Medical College: 4 NETs of the ampulla of Vater, 2 of the gallbladder, and 1 of the ovary, sphenoid sinus, Meckel's diverticulum, and epiglottis. The clinical presentation of such tumours and their management are discussed.","945":"We report an 8-year-old proband with severe motor and intellectual disability presenting a variety of dysmorphic features such as microcephaly, prominent glabella (ridged metopic suture) and congenital distal limb contractures. As well as panhypopituitary insufficiency, brain defects, e.g. agenesis of corpus callosum, colpocephaly, and pachygyria as well as strabismus and tracheo-laryngeal hypoplasia, were diagnosed. Genetic examination revealed a normal karyotype and excluded Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome and subtelomeric deletions. Chitayat-Hall syndrome was diagnosed based on clinical traits.","946":"Cushing's disease is related to a significant increase in mortality due to chronic hypercortisolaemia complications. It is known that 50% of non-treated subjects die within 5 years. Transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy is the treatment of choice. The incidence of relapses, even following a successful surgical procedure, is high and reaches 20-25% during the 5-year follow-up period. The authors discuss the case of a patient, currently aged 60, after repeat pituitary surgery, with progressive cardiovascular complications, in whom persistent Cushing's disease was diagnosed. The diagnosis was determined despite normal plasma ACTH, serum cortisol levels, and 17-OHCS concentrations in daily urine. There was also a lack of obvious pituitary adenoma features in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Persistent Cushing's disease was diagnosed based on the combined dexamethasone desmopressin test. The presented case points to the role of provocative testing, including the desmopressin test following 1 mg of dexamethasone, for diagnostically difficult cases of Cushing's disease.","947":"The normalization of cellular glucose assimilation is the basic aim of metabolic therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It requires parallel changes in the process of cellular glucose transport (CGT). This review presents the pathophysiological and clinical outlines of CGT. Sequentially, the advances in the mechanisms and classification of CGT and their physiological and molecular base are described. The role of CGT pathogenetic significance in diabetes mellitus is stressed. Finally, the opinion is expressed that the CGT study is a potentially important approach to clinical interpretation of glucose metabolism disturbances and their pharmacotherapy.","948":"The current world epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus results from two general groups of causative factors. One is the influence of strong pathogenetic environmental pressures - also described as negative civilizational influence - on the very large subpopulation, assessed at 30% of the total world population, which is genetically predisposed to react to this external stress with the symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Such a pathogenetic reaction is based on the appearance of cellular and organ resistance to insulin. A second factor involves the beta cells of the pancreatic islets and their dysfunction. For these reasons, studies on the aetiology of insulin resistance have significance, both theoretical and practical. There are many biological deviations that can produce cellular insulin resistance and underutilization of glucose. The mechanism that is always present is the decrease of cellular glucose transport. For this reason, it should be approached as a potential target for preventive and therapeutic actions. These pathophysiological and clinical circumstances were the motivation for presenting a review of cellular glucose transport pathophysiology, which contributes to the aetiology of insulin resistance, cellular underutilization of glucose, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. They underline the significance of cellular glucose transport as a target for prevention and therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other insulin resistant conditions. This review presents comments about the influence on cellular glucose transport of diet, physical exercise, and pharmacotherapeutic agents, based on the authors' studies. The review could contribute to an innovative approach to the pathogenesis, prevention, and therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other conditions related to insulin resistance.","949":"There are controversial data about the role of zinc deficiency in the aetiology of endemic goiter. The aim of the present study was to determine the association between zinc status and goiter in schoolchildren of Isfahan. This study was performed in 2005. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-one schoolchildren were enrolled, and thyroid size was determined by inspection and palpation. Urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and serum zinc level were measured in a group of those children. The prevalence of goiter was 32.9%. The median UIC was 195.5 microg\/L. Serum zinc was measured in 94 goitrous and 326 nongoitrous children. The mean + or - standard deviation of serum zinc in goitrous and non-goitrous children was 100.81 + or - 22.33 and 96.00 + or - 25.79 microg\/dL, respectively (P = 0.08). The prevalence of zinc deficiency (serum zinc &lt; or = 65 microg\/dL) in goitrous and non-goitrous children did not differ significantly (6.4 % v. 8.0%, P = 0.61). The prevalence of goiter is still high in Isfahan schoolchildren. It seems that zinc status is not involved in the high prevalence of goiter in this region. The role of other possible goitrogens should be investigated in Isfahan. ","950":"The results of large clinical studies indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective agents in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), even if their blood pressure is within normal limits. In the present study, we compared the effect of plasma- and tissue-type angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on plasma levels of leptin and adiponectin in normotensive subjects with isolated CAD. We analyzed the samples obtained from 45 patients with isolated CAD, treated for 90 days with enalapril (20 mg\/d, n = 15) or perindopril (4 mg\/d, n = 16), or not receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 14). Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were determined at baseline, and after 30 and 90 days of treatment. Compared to healthy subjects (n = 15), CAD patients had lower plasma levels of adiponectin and higher plasma content of leptin. Neither enalapril nor perindopril treatment was associated with any significant changes in blood pressure. Administration of perindopril resulted in an increase in plasma adiponectin and a reduction in plasma leptin. No significant changes in these hormones were observed after enalapril treatment. Our results indicate that perindopril is superior to enalapril when it comes to affecting the hormonal function of human adipose tissue. This suggests that tissue-type angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are a better treatment option for normotensive individuals with CAD than plasma-type ones. ","951":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on glycaemic control, atherosclerosis, inflammatory markers, and other clinical and laboratory parameters in patients undergoing systemic HBOT for diabetic foot ulcerations. Twenty-eight patients with Wagner grade 2-4 diabetic foot ulcerations were included. All patients were given 100% oxygen at 2.4 absolute atmosphere (ATA) for about 105 minutes, five times a week for a total of 30 sessions. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), homeostasis model measurement-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), uric acid, mean platelet volume (MPV), complete blood count, and lipid profile were tested. Upon completion of treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in the mean values of all assessed parameters. HBOT was shown to have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis and glycaemic control in diabetic patients. Further large-scale randomized studies are needed to study the systemic effects of HBOT. ","952":"GLUT4 is a representative of the family of integral membrane proteins which facilitate glucose transport across cellular membranes. In the available literature there is no publication referring to the investigations of glucotransporter expression in pre-diabetic subjects. However, GLUT4 protein overexpression was shown in leukocytes of diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to compare GLUT4 quantitative expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes in type 2 diabetes mellitus risk groups to healthy subjects. The study groups included 15 pre-diabetic subjects and 15 persons with normal glucose tolerance and positive family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (first-degree relatives). As a control group, 15 healthy persons with no family history of diabetes were enrolled. The expression of GLUT4 on the surface of peripheral blood lymphocytes was investigated with the use of indirect immunofluorescence. Quantitative determination of GLUT4 was performed with the use of flow cytometry. In the control group, GLUT4 expression amounted to 12 + or - 1.5% and was significantly lower in relation to both pre-diabetic subjects (18.2 + or - 8.8%; p = 0.008) and the positive family history group (17.9 + or - 9%; p = 0.001). GLUT4 overexpression in subjects with positive family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus suggests that cellular glucose transport disturbances occur prior to hyperglycaemia. Determination of GLUT4 expression appears to be a possibly useful method of early detection in individuals at high risk of diabetes. ","953":"Aim of the study was present personal observations connected with the management of patients referred to surgical treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHT) or tertiary hyperparathyroidism (THT), and to assess immediate results of such management. A total of 175 patients aged 21-80 years were treated surgically for SHT, and 16 patients aged 36-64 years were treated surgically for THT, between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2008. The patients were classified for surgical treatment in cooperation with a nephrologist, internist, and anaesthesiologist. Each patient underwent bilateral exploration of the neck and assessment of all identified parathyroid glands. Subtotal parathyroidectomy or resection of parathyroid glands combined with autotransplantation (the latter in two patients with recurrent SHT) were performed. Ionized calcium concentration in blood serum, water-electrolyte equilibrium, and cardiovascular system were monitored postoperatively. A fall in ionized calcium levels was obtained postoperatively in all patients. Successful surgical treatment was confirmed by intraoperative macroscopic and immunochemical examinations. Intensive bleeding from the wound was noted in 2 (1%) patients, and intensified stenocardial symptoms in 15 (7.9%) patients with SHT. No deaths were noted during the perioperative period. Five (2.8%) patients with SHT required emergency dialyses. 1. Surgical treatment of secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism requires close cooperation between the surgeon, nephrologist, internist, and anaesthesiologist. 2. Successful results of the treatment, including minimum cardiovascular complications, can only be obtained in integrated cooperation with a dialysis centre. ","954":"The incidence rate of acromegaly is 50 to70 persons per one million people. It occurs twice as often in women than in men, especially in middle age. In the course of the disease, insulin resistance develops, which is connected with the hypersecretion of somatotropin. Type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs more frequently in patients with acromegaly than in the rest of the population. It is diagnosed in 13-56% of acromegaly sufferers; impaired glucose tolerance occurs in 16-46% of examined patients with acromegaly. The aim of this study is to estimate disturbances of glycaemia in patients with diagnosed acromegaly, hospitalized in the Endocrinology and Diabetology Department of Collegium Medicum University of Nicolaus Copernicus in Bydgoszcz in the years 2001-2009. The participants were a group of 70 patients with acromegaly diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms, high levels of somatotropin, and MRI imaging of the pituitary gland. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 19 patients (27%); there were 11 cases (15%) of diagnosis of impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) and imapired glucose tolerance (IGT) combined. Normoglycaemia was recognized in 57% of participants (40 patients). The average age of participants with concomitant type 2 diabetes was 56.1 years, whereas the average age of those without carbohydrate metabolism disturbances was 47.1 years. In patients with acromegaly, the incidence rate of type 2 diabetes is 3-4-times higher than in the rest of the population and increases with age, especially after the age of 60.

Due to documented changes in dietary habits and physical activity levels, both observed in growing children and adults, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency is continuously increasing. National consultants and experts in the field have established some Polish recommendations for prophylactic vitamin D supplementation in infants, toddlers, children, and adolescents as well as in adults, including pregnant and lactating women basing on a review of current literature.","957":"Thyroid associated ophthalmopathy, or thyroid eye disease (TED), is a complex inflammatory disorder of the eye that, as its name implies, is usually associated with thyroid disease. Clinical observation supports the existence of three main TED subtypes, namely ocular myopathy, congestive myopathy, and mixed congestive and myopathic ophthalmopathy. Although the precise pathophysiology of TED remains unclear, it is likely to reflect an autoimmune reaction involving sensitised T lymphocytes and autoantibodies directed against a specific orbital or thyroid-and-orbital shared antigen(s). One well-studied candidate in this immune reaction is the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which is also expressed in the orbital fibroblast and preadipocyte. Most patients with ophthalmopathy have associated Graves' disease, 10% have Hashimoto's thyroiditis in which the eye changes are often mild and expressed mainly as upper eyelid retraction (UER), and 10% have no apparent associated thyroid disease - so-called \"euthyroid Graves' disease\". Ophthalmopathy can also occur in some patients with transient thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, and Graves' disease many years after treatment of the hyperthyroidism - situations where TSHR antibodies are not expected to be present, suggesting that the relationship between TSHR antibodies and the eye disorder has not been established for all cases. In our studies of TED we have investigated the nature and significance of antibodies targeting other eye muscle and orbital connective tissue (OCT) antigens, in particular the calcium binding protein calsequestrin (CASQ1) and the orbital fibroblast membrane antigen collagen XIII. Our working hypotheses for the pathogenesis of TED are: i) the initial reaction in the orbit is antibody and T lymphocyte targeting of the TSHR in the OCT compartment, and ii) the associated extra ocular and upper eyelid muscle inflammation reflects either autoimmunity against primary skeletal muscle antigens such as CASQ1 or a secondary, non specific effect of the OCT reactions as proposed by the main proponents of the \"TSHR hypothesis\". Here, we review the evidence that autoimmunity against the TSHR expressed in the orbit can be implicated in the development of all cases of TED. Although there is a close general correlation between ophthalmopathy and TSHR antibodies there are many exceptions, suggesting that the continued study of the possible role of autoimmunity against calsequestrin and collagen XIII is justified.","958":"A case of POF in a 31-year-old woman with karyotype 47,XXX. The aim of the study was to discuss a case of POF in a 31-year-old patient with polysomy 47,XXX. The described karyotype is not usually associated with this characteristic physical phenotype. In some rare cases, menstrual disorders, sterility, secondary amenorrhoea, premature menopause, and low intelligence are found. Our observations revealed the necessity for cytogenetic examination in all women at reproductive age with symptoms of premature ovarian failure. According to the data found in literature, patients with POF and karyotype disorders belong to the risk group of premature death, mostly for cardiological reasons. Raising patient awareness about the risk may have a positive effect on quality of life and regularity of check-ups.","959":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited endocrine disease characterized by pancreatic, parathyroid, and anterior pituitary tumours. Hypercalcaemia due to parathyroid tumours is usually the first manifestation of MEN 1. Pancreatic islet tumours occur less frequently, among them gastrinomas and insulinomas are the most prevalent. Prolactinomas are a relatively common pituitary presentation of the syndrome. The gene causing MEN 1 is localized in chromosome 11q13 and encodes a protein named menin, which interacts with various proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, cell division, and DNA repair. Various mutations in the menin gene have been described, but so far no strong correlation between genotype and phenotype has been found. We report a case of a 31-year-old man, a lawyer, who was diagnosed with MEN 1 syndrome in 1999 at the age of 21 when he was operated because of prolactinoma and hyperparathyroidism. In 2000 insulinoma was suspected and eventually multifocal lesions in the pancreas were revealed. However, the patient did not agree to be operated on. Since then he has been followed up and has been treated with diazoxid. We observed gradual progression of the disease, but the patient remains in relatively good condition. Careful screening for MEN 1 is important in young patients with pituitary tumours. Regular follow up is crucial even after surgical treatment. The presented patient developed gradual enlargement of insulinomas and reoccurrence of hyperparathyroidism as well. ","960":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive disorder in premenopausal women and is frequently accompanied by the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. It has also been recognized that PCOS women are characterized by cardiopulmonary impairment. Reduced cardiopulmonary functional capacity and the autonomic dysfunction associated with abnormal heart rate recovery might be responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with PCOS. Exercise training has beneficial effects on cardiopulmonary functional capacity and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in PCOS women.","961":"Human body weight is maintained at a fairly stable level regardless of changes in energy intake and energy expenditure. Compensatory mechanisms within the central nervous system (CNS), which regulate food intake and energy expenditure, are triggered by other central and peripheral signals. Peripherally, the main sources of those signals are the adipose tissue, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. The main signal originating from the adipose tissue is leptin, which promotes the activation of anorexigenic pathways in the CNS. Similarly, the central action of insulin also reduces food intake and stimulates catabolic pathways. The gastrointestinal tract contributes with several peptides that influence food intake, such as ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), oxyntomodulin (OXM), and cholecystokinin (CCK). Other substances secreted by the pancreas, such as pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and amylin, a hormone co-secreted with insulin, also affect energy balance. More recently, the endocannabinoid system has also been identified as a contributor in the maintenance of energy balance. Better understanding of these mechanistic systems involved in the regulation of energy metabolism will hopefully lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches against obesity, metabolic syndrome, and other nutritional disorders.","962":"The aim of this study was to investigate the current status of sonographic characteristics of thyroid nodules in Isfahan, a previously iodine deficient area in central Iran. In a cross-sectional study conducted in 2006, 2523 adult people (age &gt; 20 years) were selected by a multistage clustering sampling method. Of these people, 263 volunteered persons were underwent sonographic evaluation. Thyroid examination was done by two expert sonographers. Serum T(3), T(3), T3RU, TSH, TPO Ab and Tg Ab, and urinary iodine were measured. Forty-six per cent of the 263 people were women. Their mean age was 35.5 years with a range of 20-64 years. Median urinary iodine was 19.4 microg\/dL. The prevalence of thyroid nodules on sonography was 22.4% in the whole group; 30% in women and 16.3% in men (OR = 2.2, P = 0.01). The prevalence of thyroid nodules increased with age (P = 0.006). The prevalence of thyroid nodules was higher in hypothyroid people than in euthyroid people (35.1% v. 20.5%, OR = 2.1, P = 0.04). Neither urinary iodine nor autoantibody concentrations correlated with the prevalence of thyroid nodules in sonography. The prevalence of thyroid nodule by sonography is still high despite relatively normal urinary iodine in this population. ","963":"We investigated the effects of insulin on glucose transport in human peripheral lymphocytes using flow cytometry. We hypothesized that lymphocytes could be used as tools to study insulin action at the cellular level and facilitate the investigation of mechanisms that lead to insulin resistance. Blood was withdrawn from 25 healthy subjects. The expression of glucose transporter (GLUT) isoforms in plasma membrane and the rates of glucose transport were determined with and without insulin (10 to 100 mU\/L). Anti-CD3 phycoerythrin monoclonal antibody was used for lymphocyte gating. GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 isoforms were determined after staining cells with specific monoclonal antibodies to GLUT1, 3, and 4. Glucose transport was monitored with deoxy-D-glucose, 2-[3H(G)] - 185-370 GBq. Insulin increased the uptake of deoxy-D-glucose and the expression of GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 isoforms in the plasma membrane. The optimal effects were always reached at 50 mU\/L of insulin with the increase in GLUT1, 3, and 4 expression of 12%, 44%, and 38%, respectively. Mean baseline values of deoxy-D-glucose uptake were 3409 ccpm at 15 min., 6587 ccpm at 30 min., and 12525 ccpm at 60 min. of investigation. The maximal uptake in insulin-stimulated conditions was reached with 50 mU\/L of insulin and went up to 12450 ccpm at 15 min., 37482 ccpm at 30 min., and 37916 ccpm at 60 min. of investigation (p &lt; 0.01). Peripheral blood lymphocytes may become an interesting model system to study the effects of insulin on cellular glucose transport. Flow cytometry is suitable for this investigation and may be used as a method to estimate the influence of insulin on GLUTprotein translocation and the dynamics of glucose uptake by lymphocytes. ","964":"The immunohistochemical examination of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes expression in different endocrine tumours, including pituitary adenomas, revealed membranous or cytoplasmic distribution of SSTR1-5. Currently used long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide prefers SSTR2 and SSTR5 subtypes. In an earlier study a positive correlation between the summarized score of SSTR2A + SSTR2B expressions and growth hormone (GH) response to octreotide administration was found, independently of receptor distribution within the cell. In this study we searched for the relationship between the GH inhibitory response to acute octreotide administration and SSTR2A, SSTR2B, and SSTR5 cellular localization. Thirteen acromegalic patients underwent a test of acute administration of octreotide before surgery. The drop in GH was defined as the percentage of the basal value. The pituitary adenomas from these patients were immunostained to determine the hormonal phenotype and expression of SSTR subtypes. The subcellular distribution pattern of SSTR subtypes - membranous or cytoplasmic - was determined. In the majority of specimens, cytoplasmic localization of receptor subtypes was observed, although membrane or mixed cytoplasmicmembranous localized immunopositivity also occurred. The drop in GH after octreotide administration varied between 57.1-96.7% (mean 82.1%). Among the patients with the cytoplasmic localization of SSTR5, the decrease in GH was significantly higher (92.0 +\/- 7.0%). A tendency towards the higher response in patients with cytoplasmic localization of SSTR2A and 2B was also observed (86.8% and 87.0%, respectively). It seems that cytoplasmic localization of SSTR5, SSTR2A, and SSTR2B is connected with enhanced GH inhibition after octreotide administration. It is possible that this somatostatin analogue alters the localization of subtypes SSTR2A and SSTR2B through the receptor internalization. As a consequence, the SSTR-immunopositivity in cell cytoplasm is increased. The cytoplasmic but not the membranous localization is connected with the higher responsiveness to the octreotide in somatotropinomas. ","965":"Recent experimental studies have revealed that increased ghrelin levels protect against depressive symptoms of chronic stress in rats. Moreover it was shown that neuropeptide Y (NPY) has an anxiolytic-like effect mediated through both Y1 and Y5 receptors. On the other hand, peptide YY inhibits, while ghrelin stimulates, the release of NPY. The aim of this study was to assess the association between plasma concentrations of ghrelin and PYY and the level of depression in obese women. In forty-five obese women (55 +\/- 7 years old) without concomitant diseases, body composition was estimated by bioimpedance method, in addition to anthropometric measurements. Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) was used for the evaluation of depression levels. Plasma concentrations of ghrelin and PYY were measured in collected blood samples. 23 (55.1%) women had severe (22.0 +\/- 5.2 pts) and 10 (22.2%) had mild (12.1 +\/- 1.9 pts) levels of depression. Obese women with concomitant depression were of similar age and had comparable body mass, BMI, and body composition as those without depression. In addition, there were no differences in plasma ghrelin and PYY levels between the study subgroups. No correlation between BDI and plasma concentrations of ghrelin or PYY was found. Depression in obese women does not seem to be related to the plasma levels of ghrelin and PYY. ","966":"Visfatin is a protein secreted by adipose tissue, which shows insulin mimetic properties. The role of visfatin in the development of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome continues to raise controversy. The aim of the study was to evaluate visfatin levels and to attempt to establish the relationship between visfatin and selected anthropometric and biochemical parameters in obese individuals. The study included 68 obese subjects (15 men and 53 women) aged 37.8 +\/- 13.2 years with body mass index (BMI) values of 39.4 +\/- 6.4 kg\/m(2) without a previous diagnosis of abnormal glucose metabolism. The control group comprised 30 healthy nonobese volunteers (6 men and 24 women) with normal glucose metabolism, aged 38.2 +\/- 14.9 years with BMI values of 22.8 +\/- 3.0 kg\/m(2). We found significantly higher visfatin levels in the obese subjects compared to the control group (median visfatin level of 39.6 v. 17.3 ng\/ml, p = 0.0006). In the obese group there was a statistically significant negative correlation between visfatin levels and age (r = -0.26, p = 0.034), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r = -0.28, p = 0.031) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) (r = -0.36, p = 0.0037). No statistically significant correlations were found between visfatin levels and the remaining parameters under study. In the control group, visfatin levels did not show any significant correlation with any of the parameters under study. We found elevated levels of visfatin in obese subjects, which did not correlate with the majority of anthropometric parameters with the exception of WHR (negative correlation). This correlation may suggest that elevated visfatin levels are associated with the distribution of adipose tissue characteristic of gynoid rather than visceral obesity. In the group of obese subjects, visfatin levels decreased with age and glycated haemoglobin levels.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the quantity of adipose tissue and the prevalence of metabolic disturbances, and the concentration of adipokines and proinflammatory cytokines in obese or overweight patients. Fifty-five middle-aged subjects with body mass index (BMI) &gt; 25 kg\/m(2) took part in this study. Twenty-three healthy people with normal BMI formed the control group. Twenty-one people from the study group were on a low-calorie diet. All subjects underwent anthropometric assessment, laboratory investigations, and blood-pressure examination. Patients with obesity or overweight, in comparison to those with normal BMI, showed insulin resistance and a higher concentration of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and interleukin 6 (Il-6). The concentration of adiponectin was significantly lower in this group. The patients on the low-calorie diet had significantly lower concentrations of leptin when compared to other obese people; moreover, a trend towards decreased hs-CRP concentration was seen. A significant positive correlation between leptin and hs-CRP was observed. The serum concentration of adiponectin was inversely correlated with that of TNF-alpha, IL-6, hs-CRP, and PAI-1. The results of this study may suggest the beneficial impact of a low-calorie diet on the slowing down of inflammatory processes. The observed negative correlation between the concentrations of adiponectin and inflammatory cytokines may confirm the anti-inflammatory activity of this adipokine. ","968":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is one of the most common autosomal recessive hereditary diseases. The impairment of cortisol synthesis leads to excessive stimulation of the adrenal glands by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), adrenal hyperplasia, and excessive androgen synthesis. The syndrome is characterised by a considerable correlation between the genotype and the phenotype with the type of CYP21A2 gene mutation affecting the severity of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The clinical manifestations of CAH in adults result from adrenocortical and adrenomedullary insufficiency, hyperandrogenism, and the adverse effects of glucocorticosteroids used for the treatment of the condition. Non-classic CAH may sometimes be asymptomatic. In patients with classic CAH obesity, hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance, and hyperleptinaemia are more often seen than in the general population. These abnormalities promote the development of metabolic syndrome and its sequelae, including endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease. Long-term glucocorticosteroid treatment is also a known risk factor for osteoporosis. Patients with CAH require constant monitoring of biochemical parameters (17a-hydroxyprogesterone [17-OHP] and androstenedione), clinical parameters (body mass, waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, and lipids), and bone mineral density by densitometry. The principal goal of treatment in adults with CAH is to improve quality of life, ensure that they remain fertile, reduce the manifestations of hyperandrogenisation in females, and minimise the adverse effects of glucocorticosteroid treatment. Patients with classic CAH require treatment with glucocorticosteroids and, in cases of salt wasting, also with a mineralocorticosteroid. Radical measures, such as bilateral adrenalectomy, are very rarely needed. Asymptomatic patients with non-classic CAH require monitoring: treatment is not always necessary. Medical care for patients with CAH should be provided by reference centres, as the management of such patients requires collaboration between an endocrinologist, diabetologist, gynaecologist, andrologist, urologist, and psychologist.","969":null,"970":"Aromatase is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily that catalyzes the conversion of androgens (C(19)), namely testosterone and androstenedione, into oestrogens (C(18)), oestradiol, and oestrone, respectively. The enzyme is active in various tissues in both females and males, thus oestrogens are produced not only in gonads but also in extra-gonadal localizations such as brain, adipose tissue, breast, skin, and bone. Aromatase gene CYP19A1 located on chromosome 15 comprises nine coding exons and a number of alternative non-coding first exons that regulate tissue-specific expression. Studies on local regulation of aromatase expression and activity are important for understanding processes such as growth of oestrogen-dependent breast cancer. Rare clinical conditions of aromatase deficiency and excess have revealed some new and unexpected oestrogen functions in metabolism and bone health in both women and men. They were further studied using transgenic animal models such as aromatase knockout mice (ArKO) or (AROM+) mice overexpressing human aromatase. Research on aromatase was important for its practical outcome as it contributed to the development of aromatase inhibitors (AIs), an effective and safe group of drugs for the first-line endocrine therapy of breast cancer. Further studies are needed to establish AIs application in other oestrogen-dependent conditions, to overcome the resistance in breast cancer patients, and to develop tissue-specific selective inhibitors.

This is paralleled by a considerable bone mass loss and abnormalities of bone metabolism. As melatonin has been implicated in playing a role in inducing osteoporosis and that the effect could be mediated by the RANKL\/RANK\/OPG system, we decided to investigate the potential associations between MEL and bone status in girls with AN. To evaluate the relationship between MEL, bone metabolism (as assessed by serum levels of bone turnover markers [OC and CTx]), and OPG and sRANKL in girls with AN. A total of 57 girls with AN and 13 healthy girls, between 13 and 18 years of age, were enrolled in the study, and we evaluated BMI, fasting levels of OC, CTx, OPG and sRANKL, and levels of MEL (fasting levels and the levels at 2 a.m., at which time the secretion of the hormone peaks). We found a significantly increased mean serum level of MEL at 2 a.m. and an increased amplitude between nocturnal and morning levels of the hormone in girls with AN. We also showed a considerable suppression of the mean OC and CTx levels and an increase in serum OPG and RANKL levels paralleled by a significantly reduced OPG\/sRANKL ratio. The changes in the MEL levels at 2 a.m. showed a statistically significant negative correlation with levels of the bone markers and a positive correlation with sRANKL. The changes in the amplitude between the nocturnal and morning levels of MEL showed a negative correlation with CTx levels and the OPG\/sRANKL ratio. Our results indicate that the abnormalities of bone metabolism in girls with AN are associated with changes in the nocturnal levels of MEL with RANKL appearing to play an important role in this mechanism. The increased amplitude between the nocturnal and morning levels of MEL may adversely affect the bone tissue in girls with AN with the effect most likely resulting from influences on the OPG\/RANKL balance.

Very little is known about adipocytokine production in autoimmune thyroid diseases. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in the inflammatory and autoimmune processes. The aim of this study was to assess the serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, and IL-6 in postmenopausal euthyroid women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and compared them with concentrations in control women. Ninety-eight euthyroid women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis was confirmed with elevated thyroid peroxidise autoantibody (TPOAb) levels in serum and typical hypoechogenic pattern on thyroid ultrasound. The control group, matched for body mass index (BMI), consisted of 105 healthy postmenopausal euthyroid women. Serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT(4)), and TPOAbs were determined. When compared with controls, the women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis were characterized by significantly elevated serum concentrations of IL-6, whereas concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were not different. Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients had significantly higher serum levels of TSH than the controls. The simple linear regression analyses of the Hashimoto's thyroiditis group and all of the studied women indicated that serum leptin levels correlated positively with BMI, waist to hip ratio (WHR), TSH, and IL-6 and negatively with adiponectin. No correlation was observed between serum adiponectin and TSH, fT(4), or TPOAbs. There were no associations between serum IL-6 levels, TPOAbs, and TSH levels; however, positive correlations between IL-6 and BMI, WHR, and leptin were observed. TSH correlated positively with leptin, age, and TPOAbs. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized by an increased production of IL-6 but does not have a direct influence on leptin or adiponectin serum levels. The correlations between TSH and leptin demonstrated in this study highlight the need for future investigations. (Pol J Endocrinol 2010; 61 (1): 112-116). ","973":"A multitude of mechanisms have been implicated in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. To assess mean daily plasma concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, DHEAS, leu-enkephalin, and beta-endorphin in epileptic patients with complex partial seizures evolving to tonic-clonic in relation to frequency of seizure occurrence (groups with seizure occurrences - several per week and several per year) and duration of the disease (groups less than and more than 10 years). We decided to analyse mean daily values of beta-endorphin and leu-enkephalin because of significant differences in concentrations of these substances in blood during the day. The study was performed on 17 patients (14 males + 3 females; mean age 31.8 yrs) treated with carbamazepine (300-1800 mg\/day). The control group consisted of six age-matched healthy volunteers. Blood was collected at 8 a.m., 2 p.m., 8 p.m., and 2 a.m. Intergroup analysis was performed with the use of ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test. Mean daily concentrations of ACTH and cortisol in the blood of the patients with epilepsy were higher in comparison with those of the healthy volunteers, independently of the frequency of seizures and duration of the disease. Mean daily concentrations of beta-endorphin in the blood of the patients with epilepsy were higher in the groups of patients with more severe clinical course of disease (with more frequently occurring epilepsy seizures and longer duration of the disease) in comparison with healthy subjects. Mean daily concentrations of leu-enkephalin in the blood of the patients with epilepsy were higher in the group of patients with short duration of the disease in comparison with the group with long duration of the disease. 1. Pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity is observed in patients with clinically active epilepsy, independently of the frequency of seizures and duration of the disease. 2. Changes in endogenous opioid system activity are related to the clinical activity of epilepsy - beta-endorphin concentrations are connected with frequency of seizures and duration of the disease and leu-enkephalin concentrations with duration of the disease. 3. Endogenous opioid peptides might take part in the neurochemical mechanism of human epilepsy. (Pol J Endocrinol 2010; 61 (1): 103-110). ","974":"Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has become the standardized treatment of benign adrenal lesions over the last two decades, making the indications to open adrenalectomy (OA) limited. The purpose of this study was to show the thirty years of experience in open (OA) and laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) gained in one medical centre as well as to compare the results of OA and LA performed for benign adrenal lesions. Three hundred patients underwent 127 open and 173 laparoscopic adrenalectomies between 1979 and 2009 at M. Curie Hospital in Szczecin, Poland. Analyzed factors included patients demographic data, ASA score, indication for surgery, tumour size and side, characteristics of the removed tumours, intraoperative and postoperative outcome of LA and OA, postoperative pain sensation, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and conversion rate from LA to OA. Tumours with diameter exceeding 8 cm were excluded. There were no significant differences regarding the analyzed preoperative data in both groups of patients. The mean operative time was longer in the LA group (137 v. 82 min., p &lt; 0.0001) and the blood loss was lower in LA group (110 v. 254 mL, p &lt; 0.0001). The mean time until resumption of normal diet was shorter after LA (22 v. 44 h), as was the mean time until ambulation (17 v. 36 h), mean length of the hospital stay (4.6 v. 6.8 days), and mean time until return to normal activities (14 v. 23 days, p &lt; 0.0001 for each difference). The analgesic requirement on the first and the second day postoperatively was lower in the LA group (p &lt; 0.0001). The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications did not differ significantly between both analyzed groups. The rate of the conversion from LA to OA was 16%. The histopathological diagnosis was adenoma of the adrenal gland in the majority of cases. This study shows that LA is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated procedure. It may be recommended as a \"gold standard\" surgery in a case of benign functioning or non-functioning adrenal tumours with diameter less than 8 cm. (Pol J Endocrinol 2010; 61 (1): 94-101).

The aim of the study was to evaluate the \"psychological equipment\" of these patients to cope with stress connected with this chronic disease and the challenge of constant treatment. Fifteen patients (13 female, 2 male) were included in the study. Standard psychological tests were used to assess anxiety, temperament, depression, and emotional intelligence. The results show that patients with Addison's disease have not only increased levels of anxiety and fear, and over-reaction to stimuli, but decreased performance efficiency and need for social contact as well. Such psychological characteristics may result in difficulties in doctor-patient communication, aggravation of patients' feelings, limitation of patients' involvement in therapy, and, finally, a decrease the effectiveness of therapy. The temperamental characteristics and personal traits of patients with Addison's disease seem not to be useful in stressful events, and psychological support can be helpful in the effective therapy of these patients.

Alterations of acute phase proteins, observed in acromegaly, could lead to cardiovascular diseases. Aim of the study was to evaluate fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP) secretion in patients with acromegaly. Seventy-seven patients were divided into groups with active (AA, n = 56) and controlled acromegaly (CA, n = 21). Twenty age- and sex-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Serum fibrinogen, CRP, fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Comparison between the groups revealed: higher fibrinogen, triglycerides, glucose levels, and BMI values in AA than in the controls; higher CRP, fibrinogen, triglyceride levels, and BMI values in CA than in the controls; higher LDL cholesterol and insulin levels and lower CRP levels and BMI values in the AA group than in the CA group. Fibrinogen concentration was highest in the AA group and lowest in the control group. Fibrinogen levels were high in all patients with acromegaly, irrespective of disease status, and they were significantly higher than in healthy subjects. CRP concentration was highest in the CA group and lowest in the control group. CRP levels were significantly and paradoxically lower in patients with AA than in patients with well-controlled disease and did not explain the increased cardiovascular mortality in acromegaly. Fibrinogen plays an important role as a cardiovascular risk factor in acromegaly, irrespective of the cure of the disease. The role of CRP as a cardiovascular risk factor in patients with uncontrolled acromegaly should be better explained in future studies. (Pol J Endocrinol 2010; 61 (1): 83-88). ","977":"The normalization of cellular glucose assimilation is the basic aim of therapy in diabetes mellitus. This process should be accompanied by a proportional increase of the cellular glucose transport (CGT). The level of CGT should react to therapy typically recommended in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), composed of diet and sulfonylurea. In order to explore this clinically significant hypothesis, a clinical-experimental study was undertaken. Its aim was to determine the clinical pharmacotherapeutic significance of CGT measurements. CGT testing was performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes. CGT was assessed with 2-[(3)H(G)] glucose: before, and after the addition of sulfonylurea or sulfonylurea plus insulin to the incubation medium. Tests were performed at baseline in 28 persons with newly diagnosed, \"therapeutically naive\" T2DM and in 20 control subjects. In diabetic patients the tests for CGT were repeated after 3 months of routine diet and sulfonylurea therapy. In addition, the level of GLUT4 expression was assessed by flow cytometry before and after this therapy. Before treatment, CGT was significantly decreased in all subjects with T2DM. Incubated in-vitro cells responded directly to the addition of sulfonylurea with a moderate increase of CGT. This response was augmented by the addition of insulin to sulfonylurea in the incubation medium. The monitored three-month routine, controlled therapy with diet and sulfonylurea resulted in a significant increase of CGT process in all types of incubation tests. The basal and reactive CGT is significantly decreased in lymphocytes of persons with T2DM before the introduction of therapy. Effective therapy with diet and sulfonylurea normalizes both types of CGT - basal and reactive. It is related to the near normalization of GLUT4 expression in the studied cells. This phenomenon may be used as a new marker for diabetes mellitus pharmacotherapy. (Pol J Endocrinol 2010; 61 (1): 75-81).

The application of immunohistochemistry to diagnose surgically removed pituitary tumours revealed that a great number of pituitary adenomas are in fact plurihormonal. However, data on the incidence and the clinical relevance of the pituitary adenoma plurihormonality are still scarce and controversial. Hundred fifty-five pituitary adenomas, surgically removed, were studied immunohistochemically with the antibodies against pituitary hormones or their subunits. Additionally, 40 adenomas were immunostained with Ki-67 antibody to evaluate the proliferative potential. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, we did not consider tumours expressing both FSH and LH (gonadotropinomas) or somatoprolactinomas expressing both GH and prolactin as plurihormonal. Even with this limitation, plurihormonality was found to be a frequent finding in both hormonally active and clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas. It was shown that over one-third (36.1%) of the investigated adenomas expressed more than one hormone. Plurihormonality, especially that which is connected with co-expression of ACTH, seems to be more frequent in the recurrent tumours. Plurihormonal adenomas also possess higher Ki-67 indices, as compared to monohormonal tumours. Plurihormonality is a frequent phenomenon in both hormonally active and clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas. It also seems to predict a higher risk of tumour recurrence.

Therapeutic results were analyzed after six months based on clinical and hormonal status. The evaluation also included effects of the initial hormonal status on the outcome of (131)I therapy in Groups II and IV (v. respective controls, i.e. Groups III and V); such analysis was not performed in Group I because all the patients in that group were initially hyperthyroid. In 145 patients (72.5%) the therapy with (131)I was effective. In 55 patients (27.5%) the therapy was ineffective. The application of thiamazole during the peritherapeutic period in patients treated with 131I reduced the effectiveness of radioiodine, while lithium carbonate had no effect on the therapy outcome. Prednisone increased the effectiveness of the therapy with (131)I. Normalisation of the initial concentration of TSH was advantageous for the (131)I therapeutic outcome only when the assumed absorbed doses of 150-200 Gy were applied, while being of no avail for doses above 250 Gy. The present results indicate the necessity of careful analysis of administered drugs in hyperthyroid patients while qualifying them to (131)I therapy.

There are no \"gold standard\" methods for PA screening. The aim of study was plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and ARR assessment as criteria for diagnosis of PA and their usefulness in clinical practice. Eighty-one consecutive patients were admitted for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism: 51 women and 30 men, aged 31-69 years. In each patient, PAC and PRA were evaluated by radioimmunoassay. In 65 patients, urine concentration of catecholamine metabolites was assayed, and in 51 patients, diagnostics for hypercortisolaemia was carried out. In patients with adrenal incidentaloma, 16-row computer tomography was performed. The proportion of patients with PAC over 150 pg\/ml was 35% (n = 28). The number of patients with PRA under 0.07 ng\/ml\/h was 19 (n = 15). The ratio of patients whose values of ARR exceeded over 20, 30, 40, 50, and 180 were 55, 47, 37, 28, and 15%, respectively. The most common indication for primary screening was the presence of incidentally found adrenal mass. The quotient of plasma aldosterone concentration\/plasma renin activity at whichever cut-off point is not effective enough for the selection of patients for further diagnostics or its cessation.

Besides the development of surgical techniques and introduction of laparoscopic method as a routine operating treatment of adrenal lesions, also other factors like a development of the endocrinological and imaging diagnosis together with the knowledge of etiology and understanding of hormonal interactions of the adrenal glands have contributed to it. Based on experience of the Department of General, Vascular and Transplant surgery WUM where between 1997-2009 711 adrenalectomies were carried out (529 laparoscopic and 182 classical) current methods of adrenal operation, qualifications and indications were presented. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy confirming it's safety and benefits has gained the approval of the medical fraternity and became the main method of surgical treatment. 1. Videoscopic\/laparoscopic adrenalectomy became the recommended operation in the treatment of adrenal lesions. 2. Close multidisciplinary cooperation of doctors participating in the treatment of patients with adrenal pathology has made the adrenal gland surgery the most rapidly developing field of the endocrine surgery.

In this paper we review the latest aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of transsexualism and the most common complications of hormonal intervention.","992":"Adequate vitamin D intake and its status are important not only for bone health and Ca-P metabolism, but for optimal function of many organs and tissues throughout the body. Due to documented changes in dietary habits and physical activity level, both observed in growing children and adults, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency is continuously increasing. National Consultants and experts in the field established polish recommendations for prophylactic vitamin D supplementation in infants, toddlers, children and adolescents as well as in adults, including pregnant and lactating women basing on current literature review.","993":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is one of the most common autosomal recessive hereditary diseases. The impairment of cortisol synthesis leads to excessive stimulation of the adrenal glands by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), adrenal hyperplasia, and excessive androgen synthesis. The syndrome is characterised by a considerable correlation between the genotype and the phenotype with the type of CYP21A2 gene mutation affecting the severity of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The clinical manifestations of CAH in adults result from adrenocortical and adrenomedullary insufficiency, hyperandrogenism, and the adverse effects of glucocorticosteroids used for the treatment of the condition. Non-classic CAH may sometimes be asymptomatic. In patients with classic CAH obesity, hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance, and hyperleptinaemia are more often seen than in the general population. These abnormalities promote the development of metabolic syndrome and its sequelae, including endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease. Long-term glucocorticosteroid treatment is also a known risk factor for osteoporosis. Patients with CAH require constant monitoring of biochemical parameters (17a-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione), clinical parameters (body mass, waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, and lipids), and bone mineral density by densitometry. The principal goal of treatment in adults with CAH is to improve quality of life, ensure that they remain fertile, reduce the manifestations of hyperandrogenisation in females, and minimise the adverse effects of glucocorticosteroid treatment. Patients with classic CAH require treatment with glucocorticosteroids and, in cases of salt wasting, also with a mineralocorticosteroid. Radical measures, such as bilateral adrenalectomy, are very rarely needed. Asymptomatic patients with non-classic CAH require monitoring: treatment is not always necessary. Medical care for patients with CAH should be provided by reference centres, as the management of such patients requires collaboration between an endocrinologist, diabetologist, gynaecologist, andrologist, urologist, and psychologist.","994":null,"995":"","996":"The term precocious puberty is defined as the appearance of secondary sex characteristics before the age of 8 in girls and 9 in boys. There are two major forms of premature sexual maturation: gonadotrophin-dependent (central, or 'true' precocious puberty) and gonadotrophin- independent precocious puberty. The latter, also called peripheral precocious puberty, is characterized by increased production of sex steroids, causing the typical physical changes of puberty, in the absence of reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. It may result from several different disorders including testotoxicosis, McCune-Albright syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal and gonadal tumours. The accumulation of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of symptoms and the development of safe, effective treatment modalities have led to earlier intervention in patients with peripheral precocious puberty to prevent the decline in their psychosocial wellbeing, adult height and quality of life. We review the ethiopathogenesis, clinical picture, diagnosis and treatment of various disorders causing peripheral precocious puberty and provide the reader with current recommendations concerning approach to the patient with this health problem.","997":"The paper presents actual data concerning osteoporotic fractures (definitions, causes, epidemiologic and clinical data, consequences, treatment) particulary data about the most common fractures (distal forearm, vertebral and proximal hip fractures).","998":"In patients with primary aldosteronism (PA), it is fundamental to distinguish between subtypes that benefit from different treatment.

Based on high plasma and urine aldosterone concentration, low plasma renin activity (PRA), very high aldosterone\/PRA ratio and unilateral macroadenoma detected in computed tomography, aldosterone producing adenoma was diagnosed and the patient was performed unilateral adrenalectomy. Despite the surgical treatment the patient still presented with clinical and biochemical PA symptoms. Moreover, histological examination suggested adrenal hyperplasia, and laboratory tests were typical for glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism.

A total of 4775 patients were treated surgically between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2007 for various types of goitres. Thyroiditis was diagnosed in 193 (4.0%) cases. Among them Riedel's goitre was found in one (0.5%). A 51-year-old woman P.G. (case record No. 1377\/2007) was admitted to our hospital with considerable dyspnea, both inspiratory and expiratory, accompanied by marked stridor and retrosternal goitre, the latter suspected of neoplasmic process. Thyroid gland was hard, its left lobe extending behind the sternum. No disorders in thyroid hormonal function or high antibody titre against thyroid peroxidase were observed. Ultrasonography revealed large thyroid gland with mediastinal invasion, nodulated and hypoechogenic. Fineneedle biopsy suggested thyroid colloidal tumor. X-ray of the chest and neck revealed wide upper portion of the mediastinum and narrow trachea. Laryngological examination confirmed paralysis of left vocal fold. The patient was operated under general endotracheal anesthesia. Both thyroid lobes were partially resected together with the isthmus, and malacic trachea was decompressed. No complications were observed during postoperative period. Paraffin histopathological examination confirmed the presence of Riedel's goitre. The patient was discharged in general good condition. She was under regular follow-up control and died 1.5 year after operation from further progress of the disease. Clinical course of Riedel's goitre may cause remarkable diagnostic problems, and requires a differentiation with thyroid malignant tumor. Surgical treatment of Riedel's goitres helps to quickly obtain correct diagnosis and improve both clinical condition and life comfort of the patients.

Corticotropin secreting pituitary adenomas are responsible for most cases of endogenous Cushing' s syndrome. Difficulties in the diagnosis and treatment of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome concern with localization of the source of pathological ACTH secretion, particularly when magnetic resonance imaging is unable to identify the pituitary microadenoma. In this paper we present the case of a patient with symptoms of Cushing's syndrome and describe problems with localization of the source of hypercortisolemia. The diagnostic process was additionally complicated by the treatment with corticosteroids, occasionally applied due to concomitant diseases. This delayed the right diagnosis and treatment.","1001":"In recent years an increasing socioeconomic burden of two pressing problems has been observed: enormous prevalence of obesity and - along with aging of populations - great number of people affected with osteoporosis. Visceral obesity, expressed by increased waist circumference, is according to the latest guidelines a crucial component of metabolic syndrome (MS). So far the two entities have not been linked, as studies have proven beneficial effect of increased body weight on bone mineral density (BMD). It has been shown however, that adipose tissue is actually an endocrine tissue, secreting numerous biologically active substances that influence also bone. Moreover, an adipocyte and osteoblast derive from a common precursor cell. There is also increasing number of evidence showing common genetic determination of the diseases. Data from experimental and epidemiological studies proves that obesity itself as well as remaining components of MS might have negative influence on bone. BMD as well as fracture risk have been shown to be raised in patients diagnosed with MS. The same has been observed for high blood pressure. What's more, contradiction between high BMD and - simultaneously - high fracture risk in subjects with type 2 diabetes has not been convincingly explained. The paper discusses reports and controversies on coexistence and interactions between MS and osteoporosis and its complications.","1002":"Hormonal dysfunction of thyroid gland manifests, among other, in bone tissue disorders. The evaluation of changes in bone is possible not only by using the classical markers of bone turnover. Very interesting chemical compounds are osteoprotegerin and vitamin D; their serum concentration among patients with thyroid disorders can show the range of changes in bone metabolism. Osteoprotegerin possess an ability of reduction of bone resorption. Vitamin D has several \"nonclassical\" mechanisms of action, also the possibility of interaction with endogenous thyroid hormones. The aim of this study is to review the current literature concerning the role of osteoprotegerin and vitamin D in thyroid pathology.","1003":"Mood can be characterized as subjective, relatively long lasting emotional state. The impact of the mood on health can be considered in two aspects: mood as an intermediary factor\/cause of disease or as its result.

The study group consisted of 70 individuals with Graves-Basedow's disease (56 women and 14 men) and the same amount of healthy ones. The study group of Hashimoto's disease consisted of 54 individuals (46 women and 8 men) and the same amount of healthy ones. The patients filled out three psychological methods: Profile of Mood States (POMS), University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology Mood Adjective Check List (UMACL), a personal survey and an analysis of the medical documentation. Results indicate difference between individuals with Graves-Basedow's disease and healthy ones taking under consideration mood: anger and tension, dejection, embarrassment and vigor. There is no difference between individuals with Hashimoto's disease and healthy ones considering mood. There are differences between Graves-Basedow's disease and Hashimoto's disease regarding tension - anger. No differences have been claimed concerning criterions of health such as: time of duration of disease, complications, coexisting other diseases. Nevertheless the level of hormones is connected with the mood. In case of Graves-Basedow's disease has been claimed stronger anger, sadness, embarrassment and less vigor. Individuals with Hashimoto's disease are regarded as similar to the healthy ones, without features of forced depression, irritability or embarrassment.

For immunoglobulins isolation have been used sera of pituitary disease, Addison disease and Graves-Basedow disease patients with detectable pituitary autoantibodies. For pituitary antigen isolation have been used microsomal fraction of human pituitary obtained by ultracentrifugation and solubilisation. Immunoglobulins isolation was performed on Sepharose 4B-Protein A. Immunosorbent was performed on CNBr-activated Cl-4B Sepharose.

Hypothyroidism is associated with mild hyperhomocysteinaemia. The aim of the present study was to assess plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and its determinants (folate, cobalamin) in hyperthyroid patients before and after treatment. Thirty hyperthyroid and thirty healthy premenopausal women were studied. The hyperthyroid patients were investigated in the untreated state and again after restoration of euthyroidism. The levels of homocysteine, folate, cobalamin, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT(4)), free triiodothyronine (fT(3)), and renal function were measured before and after treatment. In hyperthyroidism, tHcy was lower than in the control group. The serum level of folate was higher and serum cobalamin was lower in the hyperthyroid state. Following antithyroid drug therapy, tHcy significantly increased and folate decreased. The level of cobalamin remained unchanged. Univariate analysis in the hyperthyroid group indicated that tHcy significantly negatively correlated only with fT(3). Lower homocysteine levels in hyperthyroid state can be explained by the influence of thyroid hormone. High level of folate is only partially responsible for these changes.

There were two control groups: Group A' contained 30 patients with normal volume of the thyroid gland shown by US and (131)I-SPECT, and group B' contained 30 patients with normal volume of the thyroid gland shown by US and (99m)Tc-SPECT. The patients from the examined and control groups were divided into two subgroups - smokers and non-smokers. US of the thyroid gland was made by means of an ALOKA SSD 500 device. SPECT was performed by means of a singke-headed gamma camera by Diacam. The average volume of thyroid gland measured by (131)I-SPECT and (99m)Tc-SPECT was significantly larger according to US in the examined and control groups in smokers and non-smokers. We did not show statistically significant correlations between levels of iodine uptake and volumes of goiter evaluated by US examination together with (131)I scintigraphy. Significant differences in average values of thyroid volume between smokers and non-smokers were not observed, which might suggest a lack of goitrogenic activity of tobacco smoke or indicates a potential goitrogenic influence not significant enough in the examined group.

Additionally, lower resting heart rate was found in nondiabetic men after rehabilitation. In the women &gt;or= 50 years old, there was no significant difference between diabetic and non-diabetic. The non-diabetic women &lt; 50 years old showed significantly higher peak heart rate and HRR compared with diabetic women. These results indicate that the benefit of cardiac rehabilitation in HRR is significantly lower in type 2 diabetic men.

They are usually slowly growing, located in the small intestine, secrete serotonin, and are characterized by long survival of patients, so prognosis is generally good. The most frequently encountered clinical presentations of carcinoids are intermittent abdominal pain and carcinoid syndrome (diarrhoea and flushing). Metastases worsen the prognosis and limit the survival of the patients. We report a case of carcinoid tumour with primary focus in the ileum, with an appendix infiltration, in a thirty-two-year-old woman with acute appendicitis symptoms only. Carcinoid was diagnosed postoperatively by histopathological examination. Nowadays, twenty-five years after the surgery, there is evidence of nearly asymptomatic numerous metastases. Only intermittent abdominal pain for about 1-2 years was reported. Partial metastases resection was performed, followed by chemotherapy, (90)Y-DOTATATE and then long-acting release octreotide analogue therapy. In the meantime, severe chronic heart failure (NYHA IV) due to tricuspid combined valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed. Combined therapy, typical for chronic heart failure, together with long-acting octreotide analogue highly improved the patient's heart sufficiency and reduced carcinoid syndrome symptoms. The only adverse events of octreotide therapy were hyperbilirubinaemia and itching. Long-term survival is typical for carcinoids, but 30-years survival has not been described in the literature yet.","1014":"We present two cases of severe hepatotoxicity caused by antithyroid drugs in women with Graves disease. The first medication in both cases was methimazole replaced by propylhiouracil due to intolerance. The main symptom was jaundice lasting about 2 months. As a first step in the treatment we terminated the antithyroid drug administration and introduced prednisone and ursodesoksycholic acid therapy. The termination of thyrotoxicosis by means of 131 I administration had also positive influence on the course of disease. In summary we emphasise the significance of prompt discontinuation of antithyroid drug once toxic symptoms appeared and avoid replacement one thyrostatic drug for another in fovour of radioiodine treatment.","1015":"Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are often used by athletes as doping agents.

However, there is some evidences for many adverse effects in athletes using this form of doping. Blood tests to detect growth hormone abuse are available since several years. Surprisingly, no one has been proven to use illegal doping agents influencing GH\/IGF-1 axis.","1016":"Thyroid hormones are required for skeletal development and establishment of peak bone mass. Hypothyroidism in children results in growth retardation with delayed skeletal development, whereas thyrotoxicosis accelerates bone maturation. In adults, T(3) regulates bone turnover and bone mineral density, and normal euthyroid status is essential to maintain optimal bone strength. Population studies indicate that hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are both associated with an increased risk of fracture. Nevertheless, the mechanism of T(3) action in bone is incompletely understood. Studies in mutant mice have demonstrated that T(3) action in bone is mediated principally by T(3) receptor alpha (TRalpha). T(3) exerts anabolic actions during growth to stimulate peak bone mass acrrual, but has catabolic effects on the adult skeleton that increase bone turnover. Recent studies have also suggested that TSH may have direct actions in bone cells, but such effects are difficult to resolve in vivo because thyroid hormone and TSH concentrations are maintained in an inverse relationship by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Current understanding is based on studies in mice that harbor germline mutations in the genes encoding TRalpha, TRbeta or the TSH receptor and it is not clear whether the skeletal effects of these mutations result from disruption of primary T(3) actions in bone cells or whether they are secondary to systemic effects on other endocrine pathways that regulate skeletal development and bone mass. Tissue-specific disruption of thyroid hormone signalling in bone cells will be required to address this issue. Such studies are likely to identify key components of the T(3) signalling pathway that may represent suitable drug targets for treatment of osteoporosis.","1017":"One of the changes observed in the ageing process is the progressive reduction in androgen levels, which may be associated with the development of the clinical syndrome of androgen deficiency. The androgen receptor gene polymorphism may also contribute to the development of the above syndrome of clinical manifestations. To assess the relationship between CAG androgen receptor gene polymorphism and the development of manifestations of androgen deficiency syndrome in men aged 45 to 65. A total of 268 men aged 45-65, randomly selected from the population of Wroclaw, Poland, were included in the study. The subjects completed the Heinemann questionnaire, followed by blood sampling for determination of the CAG androgen receptor gene polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR reaction products for all the subjects were separated by capillary electrophoresis (ABI PRISM 310) and the number of CAG repeats was determined using the previously constructed standard curve: (CAG) n = 0.5*M[bp]-101. The minimum number of CAG repeats was 52 with the mean of 24. Based on the total score in the Heinemann questionnaire in all of the study subjects we found no or slight manifestations of androgen deficiency syndrome in 68 (25%) subjects, mild manifestations consistent with the andropause syndrome in 93 (35%) subjects, moderate manifestations in 88 (33%) subjects and severe manifestations in 19 (7%) subjects. The numbers of subjects with specific severities of androgen deficiency manifestations across the specific subscales were as follows: a) Psychological manifestations subscale: 111 subjects with no or very mild manifestations, 117 with mild manifestations, 33 with moderate manifestations and 7 with severe manifestations; b) Somatic manifestations subscale: 17 subjects with no or very mild manifestations, 72 with mild manifestations, 120 with moderate manifestations and as many as 59 with severe manifestations; c) Sexual dysfunction subscale: 26 subjects with no or very mild manifestations, 45 with mild manifestations, 80 with moderate manifestations and 117 with severe manifestations. In all the study men (n = 268) we found 76 with a low (&lt; 21) and 119 with a high (&gt; 23) number of CAG repeats. 1. In the entire study group (n = 268) we found a positive correlation between the number of CAG repeats and the severity of psychological manifestations. We also found that in men with a higher number of CAG repeats (&gt; 23 repeats) the somatic and psychological manifestations associated with signs of androgen deficiency are more common during the ageing period and that these patients score higher on the overall Heinemann scale. 2. We found no correlation between the number of CAG repeats in men divided into 4 subgroups with respect to their scores (hence the severity) on the overall Heinemann scale and its three subscales (psychological, somatic and sexual dysfunction subscales) and their scores.

The role of the renin-angiotensin system in supporting prostate cancer induction and progression has so far received little study. The present study was to examine the influence of Ang II, Ang III, and Ang IV on a human hormone-dependent prostate cancer line (LNCaP). Using an isotopic method, we tested the effects of angiotensins on tyrosine kinase activity, and measured cell viability using an MTT Assay. The results showed that only Ang IV significantly reduced tyrosine kinase activity and cell viability in LNCaP cells. The process seemed to be mediated partly by AT(2) and probably by another type of receptor with high affinity for Ang IV and low affinity for PD123319 and Losartan. These findings suggest that components of the renin-angiotensin system, specifically angiotensin peptides and receptors (AT(1), AT(2)) can modify prostate cancer cell viability.

The study was carried out in the group of 90 relatives in age from 13 to 65 (an average of age 33.1 +\/- 15.48 years old) and an average BMI 24.6 +\/- 4.95 kg\/m(2) (17-38 kg\/m(2)). The fasting level of C-peptide was marked by ELISA method, anti-GAD, IAA, anti-IA2 antibodies titres by RIA method. Lowered level of the C-peptide secretion was not observed in our study. In 22 persons (24.44%) increased of the fasting C-peptide secretion was assessed (&gt; 2.9 ng\/ml). Within this group, 7 relatives (31.8%) was positive titre of at least one of antibodies. We observed the positive correlation between C-peptide secretion and IAA (r = 0.282; p &lt; 0.002). Until present moment no clinical symptoms of diabetes were observed in none of the persons. The increase of fasting level of C-peptide can indicate compensatory increase of beta cell secretion. It can indirectly prove the presence of insulin resistance in this group of people. The presence of higher level of C-peptide and positive IAA titre with no clinical symptoms of type 1 diabetes, seems to be the prognostic factor to retard of clinical symptoms of diabetes.

Today there have been some improvements in the management of dyslipidaemia using lifestyle modification and medications. In this study we evaluate the management of dyslipidaemia in an academic centre. This is a descriptive study, from January 2003 until December 2007. All type 2 diabetic patients who were more than 30 years old and had at least 2 visits per year were eligible for including. Overall, 1179 patients (70.2% women) were assessed. Mean LDL-C in 2003 was 124.6 +\/- 34.6 mg\/dL, and decreased to 109.7 +\/- 28.9 mg\/dL in 2007 (p &lt; 0.05). 21.0% of patients in 2003 and 40.5% of them in 2007 had LDL-C &lt; 100 mg\/dL. TG did not change during these years. There was an increase in the use of statins from 76.3% to 84.3% (p-value &lt; 0.05) during the 5 years since 2003, but a decrease in the use of fibrates. Although recently we have made improvements in the control of dyslipidaemia in diabetic patients, we have not reached our goals. Of late, physicians have emphasized the use of statins in diabetic patients, which has resulted in much better levels of LDL-C, but still less than half of the patients are at ideal levels. In conclusion, we should revise our point of view to begin and intensify treatment of dyslipidaemia in diabetic patients, to achieve the goal of treatment and prevent cardiovascular events optimally.

Metabolic parameters of 1025 women with GDM (mean age 29 years): glucose and insulin at 0 OGTT, glucose at 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), body mass index before pregnancy, parity, and gestational age at diagnosis of GDM were analyzed. Insulin resistance and beta-cell function were evaluated by HOMA indexes (HOMA-IR and HOMA-B) at the diagnosis of GDM. The IFG GDM group (23%) consisted of isolated IFG (30%), IFG\/IGT (60%), and IFG\/DM (10%). The NFG GDM group (77%) consisted of isolated IGT (98%) and NFG\/DM (2%). Women with IFG GDM were characterized by higher prepregnancy BMI, earlier diagnosis of GDM, higher HOMA-IR (p &lt; 0.03), and lower HOMA-B (p &lt; 0.01) compared to NFG GDM. In the IFGGDM group, DM was characterized by lower HOMA-B compared with isolated IFG and IFG\/IGT. In the NFG GDM group, isolated IGT and DM were characterized by similar HOMA-IR and HOMA-B.

","1022":"Pregnancy dramatically affects the function of the adrenal glands and is associated with altered levels of adrenal hormones. Endocrine adaptation to pregnancy involves changes in the activities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axes. As a result, pregnancy may influence the course of pre-existing adrenal diseases or lead to their unmasking. Although disorders of the adrenal glands are rare during pregnancy, they may pose a serious health problem. The fact that some symptoms of adrenal disorders may be erroneously interpreted as symptoms of normal pregnancy together with overlapping their biochemical features make diagnosis of adrenal disorders in pregnancy difficult. Antenatal diagnosis and correct treatment of these disorders is necessary to prevent maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

Dominate the view that positive influence of adipose tissue on state of skeleton in postmenopausal women can be consequence of the boost to load carrying bone, may also result from the role of adipose tissue as endocrine organ. Interaction existence between somatotrophic axis and bone tissue suggests that revealing itself changes of constituents concentration of this axis in obesity individuals may have significance in bone tissue remodeling modification after menopause. It has been demonstrated that GH and IGF-I secretion decrease with age and this changes are major in obesity persons, particularly in women, and they depend on BMI and the percentage of body fat content. GH as well as IGF-I may directly and indirectly modulate bone remodeling, stimulating both bone formation and bone resorption. In the light of latest data this last effect is realized through their influence on expression of OPG and\/or RANKL, cytokines belonging to the family of tumor necrosis factor alpha, which provide important controlling process element of the numbers of activated osteoclasts through osteoblasts.","1025":"Obesity is an important healthcare problem. Steady increase in its prevalence is observed worldwide. The underlying cause of obesity is mainly increased calories intake. The regulation of appetite is held by the hypothalamus. Satiety signals are sent to central nervous system via vagus due to distension of the walls of digestive tract and secretion of cytokine signaling after meal digestion. Additionally leptin excreted from adipose tissue reflects the state of energy storage and affects the hypothalamus.

Using the criteria of diabetes control, the first group was divided into 2 subgroups: 17 patients with controlled diabetes (gr cD) and 27 patients with uncontrolled diabetes (gr uD). Next, 2 subgroups were formed according to the duration of the disease: 23 patients suffering from diabetes &gt;or= 10 years (gr mD) and 21 people suffering from diabetes &lt; 10 years (gr lD). The examinations of the patients included electrocardiography and assessments of myocardial size and contractibility and diastolic activity of the left ventricle. The echocardiographic examination revealed statistically significant differences between the groups D and C, between the groups mD, lD, and C, and between the groups cD, uD, and C. Moreover, group D additionally exhibited positive linear dependences between the duration of the disease and the diastolic interventricular septum thickness and between the duration of the disease and the mass index of the left ventricle. Myocardial differences observed in the echocardiographic image of a diabetic compared to a healthy person suggest myocardial dysfunction caused by diabetes. The existing differences between the group with controlled diabetes and the group with uncontrolled diabetes indicate that development of organic complications in diabetic patients can only be slowed down with procedures to normalise carbohydrate and lipid metabolic parameters and the arterial blood pressure.

This protein is coded by chromosom 21 together with histocompatibility antigens on surface of thyroid follicle. Until now the study suggest coexistence of autoimmune thyroid disease and Alzheimer disease. The aim of the study was evaluation of thyroid autoantibodies in Alzheimer disease. Study were performed in 34 Alzheimer disease patients. Sera of control subjects were obtained from 20 patients with vascular dementia. Incidence of thyroid autoantibodies was assessed by polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and western-blotting. Thyroid microsomes were obtained from human thyroid tissues by ultracentrifugation and solubilization in 1% desoxycholic acid. In 21 sera from 34 we detected autoantibodies against thyroid microsomal antigens reacting with 91 kDa antigen. 16 sera were reacting with 97 kDa, 13 sera with 55 kDa, and 7 sera with 67 kDa proteins. In sera of Alzheimer disease patients autoantibodies against thyroid microsomal antigens can be frequently detected. The most frequent are antibodies against 91 kDa. It is important to note that Alzheimer disease patients should be screen for thyroid hormones.

The aim of the study was determined of the number CAG repeats AR gene occurrence in the population Polish men. In the population-based cross-sectional study participated a population-based sample randomly selected 466 men aged 25-65 years -- residents of Wroclaw, Poland. The CAG polymorphism was amplified by PCR method. The range of androgen receptor CAG repeats was from 1 to 57 with a mean 24 +\/- 7,68. The most frequent repeat was 21. It was indicated in 34 (7,3%) of examined subjects. The number of triplets &lt;or= 20 had 137 (29,4%) men and &gt; 20 329 (70,6%) men. There were no differences in the length of CAG repeats among the age groups. Both the distribution of small (&lt;or= 20) and large (&gt; 20) number CAG repeats and age structure in men groups with the longer and shorter alleles were statistically all the same. The average number of AR gene CAG repeats and its range in the population Polish men were larger in comparison to the west European populations and more reminded the number repeats distribution meeting among Asians. This ethnic differences might explain the biological variabilities among different populations and another risk of hormone-dependent diseases occurrence.

To determine the effect of opium, 20 male rats were divided into control (n = 10) and opium-treated (n = 10) groups. After diabetes induction, the animals were investigated for daily glucose measurements for 35 days. Serum lipid profile and haemoglobin A1c (HbA(1c)) were assayed at the baseline (before induction of diabetes) and at 35-day follow-up. The glycaemia levels in the rats treated with opium were similar to the levels measured in the control rats (544.8 +\/- 62.2 mg\/dl v. 524.6 +\/- 50.0 mg\/dl, P = 0.434). In addition, there was no difference between the opium-treated rats and control rats in HbA(1c) (6.5 +\/- 0.5% v. 6.6 +\/- 0.2%, P = 0.714). Compared to the control rats, the serum total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride and lipoprotein (a) in the test animals were similar.

Male subjects performed a treadmill run at their individual ventilatory threshold until exhaustion. Blood samples were taken before exercise at rest, baseline (BL), at exhaustion (EXH), 30-60-90-minutes into recovery (30 mR, 60 mR, 90 mR), and 24-hours into recovery from exercise (24 hR). Blood was analyzed for free T(3) (fT(3)), free T(4) (fT(4)), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), cortisol and prolactin. ANOVA analysis revealed that at EXH all hormones were increased (p &lt; 0.01) from BL levels. At 30 mR and 60 mR the thyroid hormones had decreased and returned to BL levels; however, cortisol and prolactin remained significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). At 90 mR all hormones were not different from BL levels. By 24 hR, cortisol, fT(3) and TSH were decreased from BL (p &lt; 0.05). Correlations revealed EXH cortisol responses were related to the 24 hR TSH responses (rs = -0.69, p &lt; 0.01). In addition, EXH cortisol and 24 hR fT(3) responses were related (rs = -0.51, p &lt; 0.02). Furthermore, the EXH prolactin and TSH responses were related (r(s) = +0.56, p &lt; 0.01), and the 30 mR prolactin responses were related to the EXH TSH responses (r(s) = +0.43, p &lt; 0.05).

","1032":"The highly variable expression of SSTR subtypes in pituitary adenomas (PA) may partially explain why the subgroup of somatotropinomas or other adenomas do not respond to the therapeutic action of currently used long-acting somatostatin analogues like octreotide or lanreotide. Our study summarizes the data on expression of all somatostatin receptor subtypes (SSTR 1-5), extended for 2A and 2B SSTR isoforms, revealed by means of immunohistochemistry in dependence to different hormonal phenotype of the tumour. The pattern of SSTR immunostaining (estimated according to the percentage frequency of appearance) was in acromegaly: SSTR 5 &gt; SSTR 1 &gt; SSTR 2A = SSTR 3 &gt; SSTR 2B, in prolactinomas: SSTR 2B = SSTR 3 = SSTR 5 &gt; SSTR 1 = SSTR 2A, in gonadotropinomas: SSTR 3 &gt; SSTR 2B &gt; SSTR 1 = SSTR 2A &gt; SSTR 5, in corticotropinomas: SSTR 2A &gt; SSTR 1 = SSTR 3 &gt; SSTR 5 &gt; SSTR 2B. In PA immunonegative for pituitary hormones, we noticed only a weak staining of all receptor subtypes including SSTR 4. In plurihormonal adenomas with positive GH phenotype the staining pattern was: SSTR 5 &gt; SSTR 1 = SSTR 2B and in plurihormonal PA with negative GH phenotype: SSTR 1 = SSTR 5 &gt; SSTR 2A = SSTR 2B = SSTR 3. In plurihormonal adenoma with ACTH immunopositivity, the staining pattern was: SSTR = SSTR 2A = SSTR 3 = SSTR 5. SSTR 1 and SSTR 5 were the most frequent subtypes of somatostatin receptor in plurihormonal adenomas without ACTH expression. Human PA represents a group of tumours with a much more differentiated appearance of somatostatin receptor subtypes. It is very important to determine the SSTR profile individually for each tumour to make an appropriate decision as to therapeutic strategy choice. Apart from applying SSTR 2 and SSTR 5-preferring octreotide and lanreotide - newly synthesized multiligand analogues, such as SOM 230, KE 108, or other SST selective analogues, may represent a further useful approach for the treatment, especially in cases other than somatotropinoma or thyrotropinoma.

Symptoms of hypogonadism depend primarily on the age of the male patients at the time of development of the hypogonadism (pre- or postpubertal). The dominant findings are: impaired puberty, decrease of virilization, infertility or decrease of spermatogenesis, impotence and gynecomastia. Classically hipogonadism is divided into primary (hypergonadotropic) and secondary (hypogonadotropic). The most common causes of primary hypogonadism is Klinefelter's syndrome, while secondary--pituitary tumors. \"Peripheral\" hypogonadism results from androgen receptor polymorphism. The role of therapy of hypogonadism is to restore or maintain proper spermatogenesis as well as testosterone replacement therapy. Gonadotropin and testosterone therapy is available in treatment of hypogonadism in men.

The immunohistochemical evaluations of the specimens from biopsy revealed well-differentiated hepatic neuroendocrine metastases. The biochemical marker levels, including serum chromogranin A (CGA) and urine 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) 24-hour excretion, were significantly elevated. Whole body somatostatin receptor scintigraphy showed tracer accumulation in the liver lesions, with no extrahepatic tumour, possibly the primary origin. Long-term somatostatin analog therapy was initiated and a peptide-receptor targeted radionuclide therapy decision was made parallel to this treatment. Therefore, a followed-up CT scan of the abdomen showed, as well as the metastatic changes within the liver, a wellvascularised jejunal tumour suspected to be the primary focus of the disseminated neuroendocrine neoplasm. Unexpectedly, the pathological examination revealed a positive cell reaction for CD 117, confirming the diagnosis of a rare jejunal stromal tumour.

Manganase-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) plasma activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) plasma concentration were measured. EC-SOD plasma activity was significantly higher in women with subclinical hyperthyroidism when compared with the control group (13.3 +\/- 2.1 vs. 10.9 +\/- 1.4 NU\/ml; p &lt; 0.05), unlike Mn-SOD (4.2 +\/- 0.5 vs. 4.0 +\/- 1.0 NU\/ml). MDA plasma concentration increased significantly in women with subclinical hyperthyroidism (3.5 +\/- 1.2 vs. 2.0 +\/- 0.6 micromol\/l; p &lt; 0.05). The increased EC-SOD plasma activity may reflect disturbances of oxidative state in subclinical hyperthyroidism.

This report provides clinical picture, efficiency of diagnostics and treatment of pheochromocytoma in 8-years in the endocrinological center in Wroclaw. The records of 37 patients with pheochromocytoma were identified, who were treated in 2000-2007 in the Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Isotope Treatment in Wroclaw. There were 23 women (age 23-75 year) and 14 men (age 17-74). We studied frequency of clinical signs, usefulness of diagnostic methods and efficacy of treatment. The duration of the clinical history ranged from 2 months to 16 years. The most frequent symptoms were: hypertension paroxysmal and constant, palpitations, headache, sweating and anxiety. The most sensitive diagnostic method was increased concentration of urinary metanephrine in 24-hour urine. Computed tomography was the most widely used method for tumor localization. Adrenal pheochromocytoma was detecting by CT in all patients, predominated in right adrenal, in 1 case in urinary bladder. Surgery caused remission of hypertension in 59%, improvement in 26.8%, and no changes in 13.9% of patients. Malignancy was reported in 2 cases, 1 woman died after surgery. MEN 2A occur in 21.6%. The diagnosis of pheochromocytma is usually made after long duration of the disease. The study confirms that clinical presentation of pheochromocytoma is variable and nonspecific, this finding makes the diagnosis very difficult. The most typical symptom is paroxysmal hypertension, which is present only in 40%, other symptoms are nonspecific. The measurement of 24-hour urinary metanephrines was the best indicator. CT was almost always successful in localizing the tumor. Patients with pheochromocytoma should be consider for other endocrine diseases especially medullary carcinoma, primary hyperparathyroidism and other component of MEN 2A.

The present study was designed to assess the responsiveness of parathormone (PTH) secretion to an oral phosphate (Pi) load (100 mmol) in patients with EH - NTS and hypertensive patients with NIDDM - CNT. In 29 patients in NTS group (45.6 +\/- 1.3 y), 32 in CNT group (48.4 +\/- 0.9 y) and in 23 healthy subjects-GK (42.7 +\/- 2.7 y) - 25-OH-D(3), intact PTH, ionized (Ca(2+)) and phosphate (P) were estimated in blood serum before and PTH in 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hours, Ca(2+) and P in 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24 hours after an oral administration of Pi. Urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate were also estimated on day before and at the day of an oral Pi load. In NTS group lower basal 25-OH-D(3) serum levels (22.9 +\/- 1.7 vs. 30.9 +\/- 2 ng\/ml; p = 0.02), while in CNT group higher PTH (22.7 +\/- +\/- 2.2 vs. 15.6 +\/- 1.9 pg\/ml; p &lt; 0.05) levels were found.

The aim of this study was to explore the relation between abdominal fat distribution and some inflammatory risk factors of atheromatosis and IL-6 174G_C gene polymorphism in non-obese healthy subjects. Relationships were investigated between anthropometric variables, i.e. weight, height, BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat distribution (DXA), serum CRP and IL-6, insulin sensitivity\/resistance indices, and IL-6 174G_C gene polymorphism, in healthy non-obese Polish subjects: 232 women (age 31.4 +\/- 5.5 years) and 199 men (age 30.3 +\/- 6.0 years). The genetic study revealed that the CC genotype was observed in 15.56% of subjects, the CG genotype in 52.74%, and the GG genotype in 31.7%. IL-6 and CRP concentration did not differ among the genotypes. There were also no differences regarding BMI and WHR. The only differences among genotypes, observed only in men, were those concerning total fat (CC had higher fat content than CG and GG); the difference being statistically significant between CC and GG (p &lt; 0.05), and gynoidal fat deposit (CC had higher gynoidal fat deposit than CG and GG); the difference being statistically significant between CC and GG (p &lt; 0.025) and between CC and CG (p &lt; 0.05).

However, there are discrepancies among the results of the published data regarding its pro- or anti-angiogenic properties. The aim of our study was to examine the direct effect of various adiponectin concentrations applied separately or in combination with thalidomide on the growth of the murine endothelial cell line HECa 10 in 24- and 72-hour cell cultures. We used immortalized murine endothelial cell line received from endothelial cells of the mouse peripheral lymph node. The effect of adiponectin was examined at concentrations from 10(-5) to 10(-12)M. Thalidomide was used at 10(-3)M concentration. The growth of HECa10 cells was assessed by the colorimetric Mosmann method. We found that adiponectin inhibited the growth of HECa 10 line at all examined concentrations in the 24-hour culture, with moderate potency. There were no dose- or time-response effects. In the 72-hour cell culture, adiponectin inhibited the growth with the same or weaker potency and we did not observe its inhibitory effect at 10(-12)M concentration. There was no beneficial interaction between adiponectin and thalidomide. In this study, however, thalidomide alone did not cause any inhibitory effect on this cell line. The obtained data show that adiponectin inhibits endothelial cell growth and may participate in angiogenesis regulation as an endogenous antiangiogenic factor.

The study involved 29 patients aged 25-74 (the mean age: 52 +\/- 6 years) with infiltrative form of GO. They were classified for ophthalmopathy treatment on the basis of the following factors: the obtained euthyreosis, progressive character of eye changes, the level of eye changes determined on the basis of NO SPECS classification (at least class 3c), ophthalmopathy index (OI) according to Donaldson &gt;or= 4. GO was diagnosed as active if CAS (clinical activity score) &gt;or= 4. During the treatment, the patients received 6 cycles of methylprednisolone sodium succinate in doses of 1,0 g\/24 h given as one-hour-long intravenous infusions for three successive days in a week. Between the 2nd and 4th cycle of Solu-Medrol, orbital radiotherapy with 10 MeV X-rays was performed. The control group was made up of healthy volunteers selected with regard to sex, age, educational background and nicotine addiction so as they corresponded with the study group. It involved 53 individuals aged 21-75 (the mean age: 52,4 +\/- 14 years). QoL was assessed by means of the MOS SF-36 questionnaire. Patients with GO evaluated their QoL lower than healthy individuals, which referred to physical functioning, physical and emotional role functioning, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health and bodily pain. No correlation was found between quality of life and such factors as age, sex, or duration time of Graves disease and ophthalmopathy. Analogically, no relation was observed between the activity and stage of clinical development of eye changes and QoL. The use of the combined GO therapy contributed to a considerable decrease in the development of eye changes and the disease activity. After treatment, the patients' QoL improved which referred to physical role functioning, bodily pain, and vitality. Other QoL parameters did not statistically significantly differ. GO causes a considerable worsening of QoL. The stage of clinical development and activity of GO find no reflection in QoL. Effectiveness of treatment for GO cannot be evaluated on the basis of changes in QoL. ","1045":"Bone remodeling is essential for skeletal and the whole body health. Imbalance in skeletal turnover, so that bone resorption exceeds bone formation, may lead to reduction in bone strength and increase fractures risk. The main target of anticatabolic therapy is to normalize increased osteoclasts activity and bone turnover. Molecular mechanisms of action of this class of drugs are related with different points in cellular signaling pathways that control osteoclasts differentiation and resorbing activity. These mechanisms are briefly described in our review.","1046":"Current treatment decisions for osteoporosis depend on the fracture risk calculated based on the results of comprehensive diagnostic procedures [clinical risk factors (CRF), densitometry (BMD), morphometry, and bone turnover markers (BTM)]. Recently developed fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) represents an important new achievement as a 10-year fracture risk calculation based on femoral neck densitometry and age combined with independent clinical fracture risk factors. FRAX presents several options: FRAX BMI (body mass index) is advocated as a helpful screening tool to identify the group of patients with high fracture risk, independently of access to densitometry and FRAX, utilizing hip densitometry. In both cases, the probability of major fractures or hip fractures are calculated during performed diagnostic evaluations. Operating FRAX algorithm does not include spinal bone mineral density, which is its main limitation. With the aim of improvement of anti-fracture efficacy of therapeutic management of osteoporosis, we have extended our discussion to three integral elements of existent strategy: 1) screening outlines, 2) principles of drug selection, and 3) treatment benefit evaluation. Since osteoporosis is a chronic disease, long-term adherence to the treatment is important. The suitability of the drug, the patient's preference, tolerability, and convenience should all be considered. Anti-catabolic drugs are most appropriate in patients with high bone turnover, while anabolic drugs demonstrate efficacy irrespective of bone turnover. BMD measurement is most widely used for long-term assessment of the efficacy of osteoporosis treatment. The measurements of bone turnover markers (BTMs) can be considered a useful shortterm (at 3 months) monitoring tool in selected patients. In both BTM and BMD, the least significant change (LSC) method should be used for interpretation of the results. Fractures are not a reliable clinical endpoint for evaluating the effectiveness of therapy in individual patients because of their stochastic nature. If fractures occur, however, the need for drug change and additional non-pharmacological treatment (fall prevention, balance training, muscle strengthening) should always be considered.","1047":"Systemic inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are characterized by extensive dysregulation of bone metabolism recognized as focal articular bone erosions, juxta-articular and systemic bone loss. The complex interactions between bone cells, osteoprotegerin\/RANKL pathway and a variety of inflammatory mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of focal and systemic osteopenia. Treatments with TNF-alpha blockers inhibit inflammation-induced bone resorption and might prevent structural bone damage in RA. In some studies with anti-TNF agents, an increase in BMD has been documented in spondyloarthropathies and in RA. The B-cell depleting antibody rituximab and the T-cell costimulation blocker abatacept are emerging as other effective treatment options in RA. Studies with anti- RANKL antibody Denosumab in RA demonstrate, that treatment targeting RANKL prevents development of erosions but not inflammation.

Revealing of the molecular mechanism of action of the Klotho protein, forced us to revise this knowledge. It is known already that Kloto is a unique regulatory efector playing key role in reversing the imbalanced extracellular Ca(++) concentrations, by affecting the intensity of the transepithelial transport and modulation of the parathormone excretion. In cooperation with the phosphaturic hormone - Fgf23 it regulates calcium concentration by suppression of 1,25(OH)(2)D synthesis, and reabsorption of phosphate in a distal convoluted part of nephron. Acting through these mechanisms Klotho takes part in the regulation of the mineral homeostasis of cerebrospinal fluid, blood and body fluids acting on the choroid plexus, parathyroid glands and distal convoluted nephrons. In that way Klotho becomes one of the main players in a complex and multilevel system of maintaining the mineral homeostasis of the organism.","1050":"Leptin is considered to exert dual effect on bone metabolism: anabolic (through peripheral pathways) and antiosteogenic (through central nervous system). The total leptin's effect on bone is not known. The aim of the study was to examine bone metabolism and leptin concentration in patients with morbid obesity before and after bariatric surgery (BS). Forty one patients with morbid obesity selected for BS were included in the prospective study. Body mass index (BMI), serum leptin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine (LS) and proximal femur (PF) were examined before and 6 months after BS. Before operation (mean BMI 44.0 kg\/m(2)) mean leptin and PTH concentration was increased (accordingly 37.1 ng\/ml and 82.7 pg\/ml), mean 25OHD concentration was decreased to 4.3 ng\/ml. Mean BMD was within the upper limit of the population reference range. Leptin concentration was positively correlated with BMI. There was no correlation of leptin with BMD (in LS and PF), PTH and 25(OH)D. Following the operation (mean BMI 31.8 kg\/m(2)) mean leptin concentration decreased by 30.6 ng\/ml (p &lt; 0.001), PTH decreased by 38.9 pg\/ml (p &lt; 0.001), 25(OH)D increased by 2.1 ng\/ml (NS).

Weight loss in patients with morbid obesity after BS leads to decrease in serum leptin, increase in BMD in LS and decrease in PF. These changes are accompanied by regression of hyperparathyroidism, which is probably secondary to vitamin D deficiency.

The aim of the study was to estimate the utility of laboratory tests in evaluation of fracture risk and in differential diagnostics of low bone mass in asymptomatic postmenopausal women. That was a retrospective study of 207 women. The results of laboratory investigations, densitometry and thoracic lumbar X-rays were analyzed. The relationship between BMD, vertebral fractures and abnormal lab tests was investigated. In patients with low BMD, reasons of this pathology was determined and costs of differential diagnostics were estimated. There were no differences in prevalence of abnormal lab tests in women with BMD that met and didn't meet densitometry criteria of osteoporosis (85.05% vs. 82.00%). Similarly, in people with and without vertebral fractures (84.44% vs. 86.27%). There was no relationship between osteoporosis and abnormal tests except of high PTH in the group with vertebral fractures. In 64% of women, the cause of low BMD was asymptomatic pathology other then primary osteoporosis - most often vitamin D deficiency (52.0%). Costs of lab tests used in differential diagnostics were between 45 and 153 PLN, person and 182.50-409.10 PLN per diagnosis. 1. Laboratory tests aren't useful to assess fracture risk. 2. In 64% of asymptomatic postmenopausal women with low BMD, the cause of this abnormality may by pathology that coexists with primary osteoporosis. 3. To assess the cause of low BMD, except basic lab tests, 25(OH)D should be tested. ","1052":"Recently, a new fracture risk-assessment calculator (FRAX) has been introduced. The aim of this study was to assess its usefulness for the re-assessment of fracture risk in obese patients and re-assignment to treatment. 350 obese female patients were included. In all of them, 10-year fracture risk was calculated using FRAX (with and without T score value). If major osteoporotic fracture risk was calculated with BMD, it was low in most of the patients (in 82.1% of those treated, and in 95.9% of those not treated it was below 10%). Mean risk values were significantly higher in the treated (7.7 [3;39]%) than in the non-treated group (4.6 [2.1;14]%). The reason for start of treatment in 95 out of 106 patients was a sustained low-energy fracture, low BMD, or both. The WHO fracture risk calculator may be a useful tool in treated obese females with osteoporosis. The information regarding 10-year fracture risk may change the treatment strategy at least for those in whom the decision of treatment was based solely on low BMD. ","1053":"It has been shown that more than 50% of people with a chronic disease, including osteoporosis, discontinue treatment during its first year. This problem increases with the time of observation. The aim of this study was to assess alendronate compliance over a period of 6 or 18 months in clinical practice of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Using a retrospective study of clinical histories (357) obtained in our Outpatient Clinic, as well as telephone interviews with patients, the compliance with alendronate therapy in postmenopausal patients was assessed. After 1.5 years on observation 20.4% of patients, and after 0.5 years 8.5% of patients, discontinued their treatment as a result of intolerance (especially side effects on the gastrointestinal tract) (47.8%), health problems unrelated to osteoporosis (8.7%), inconvenience of the daily regimen (13.1%), costs (4.3%), and improvement of clinical condition (26.1%). It is worth mentioning that in both periods of observation (1.5 and 0.5 years) almost the same percentage of patient discontinued visits at our Outpatient Clinic (15.6% and 14.4%, respectively). Telephone interviews with patients who stopped attending the Outpatient Clinic at the Regional Centre of Menopause and Osteoporosis revealed that more than 50% of them discontinued the treatment. Not all patients treated with alendronate are compliant. Osteoporosis is a chronic disease, which needs long clinical observation and constant adherence to medication. Effective communication between doctor and patient, and follow-up visits that are more frequent would greatly improve the adherence to osteoporosis treatment modalities. Compliant patients achieved increases in bone mass density with simultaneous fracture risk reduction. ","1054":"The aim of the study was the determination of the prevalence of asymptomatic vertebral deformities in healthy persons of the Polish population, based on morphometric X-ray absorptiometry (MXA), and comparison of the results with data from literature, obtained by other techniques. The study involved 829 persons, including 520 women and 309 men, aged 18-79 years, untreated for osteoporosis before. The Th(4) to L(4) vertebrae were examined. Lateral scans of the thoracic-lumbar spine were made by an Expert-XL densitometer. Six point digitization was used to calculate the anterior (Ha), central (Hc), and posterior (Hp) height of the Th(4)-L(4) vertebral bodies. The vertebrae were defined as having prevalent deformities when at least one ratio value (Ha\/Hp, Hc\/Hp, Hp\/Hp up, or Hp\/Hp low) fell 3 SDs below or even more than the reference mean of that ratio at any vertebral level. The analysis was performed on 9629 vertebrae, of which 167 (1.75%), evaluated as deformed and considered as fractures, were observed in 113 patients (13.63 % of the examined patients). In 81 persons (74% of the patients with fractures; 9.7% of the studied population), single fractures were demonstrated, while in 28 persons, multiple deformities prevailed. Fractures occurred in 108 women (20.7% of the examined women) and 42 men (13.5% of the examined men). The highest incidence of deformities was observed in women over 55 years of age. First-degree deformities dominated. Deformities of the Th(8) and Th(6) vertebrae were most frequently observed. 1. Using MXA, it was found that in the Polish population deformities of vertebrae are common, as was demonstrated in X-ray morphometric studies in the European Vertebral Observation Study (EVOS). 2. Densitometric morphometry, as a non-invasive technique, may become a useful tool in the diagnostics of vertebral fractures.

Alterations in growth hormone (GH)\/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) pathway (e.g., in condition of GH overproduction or deficiency) are tightly linked with enhanced oxidative stress. The results of experimental and clinical studies, in which effects of GH and IGF-I on oxidative processes were revealed, are presented in the survey.","1056":"Ageing may cause an increase in parathormone (PTH) secretion and, subsequently, increased bone resorption and osteoporosis. In recent years two subfractions of PTH have been discovered: cyclase-activating (1-84, CAP) and cyclase-inhibiting (7-84, CIP) PTH. It is not known however, whether these may play a role in the pathogenesis of bone loss in elderly subjects. Sixty elderly women were examined, of whom 29 had a T-score of the ultradistal radius &lt; -2.5 (median age 75 [70-80] years, BMI 25 [20.6-33.8] kg\/m(2), creatinine clearance 59.9 [39.2-94.9] ml\/min\/1.73m(2), serum Ca 2.4 [2.2-2.6] mmol\/l), while 31 had a T-score &gt; -2.5 (median age 73 [70-86] years, BMI 26.2 [18.8-32.5] kg\/m(2), creatinine clearance 54.8 [23-119.2] ml\/min\/1.73m(2), serum Ca 2.4 [2.2-2.6] mmol\/l). Median bone mineral density (BMD) (DXA, Lunar) of the ultradistal radius was 0.263 (0.195-0.449) g\/cm(2) and 0.326 (0.236-0.448) g\/cm(2) (p &lt; 0.0001), with a median T-score of -3.48 and -1.4, respectively. Each patient with a serum concentration of 1-84 and 7-84 PTH was assessed. Patients with low BMD did not differ from those with higher BMD with regard to serum iPTH (16 [6-51] vs. 11.5 [7-35] pg\/ml, p = 0.066) and CIP (6 [1-14] vs. 4.5 [2-13] pg\/ml) concentrations. However, serum CAP concentrations (10.5 [4-41] vs. 6 [4-22] pg\/ml, p &lt; 0.05) and CAP\/CIP ratios (2.0 [0.71-11] vs. 1.25 [0.5-4.2], p &lt; 0.05) were significantly higher in the low BMD group. In elderly women increased serum CAP concentrations and CAP\/CIP ratios are associated with low BMD of the trabecular bone. ","1057":"Generally, squamous cell carcinoma carries a poor prognosis because of its tendency to local invasion and subsequent metastasis, which is mediated by multiple factors and angiogenesis. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent mitogen for epithelial cells and regulates cell proliferation and migration and survival tumour angiogenesis and invasiveness. The aim of the study presented here was to determine the serum concentration of HGF in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma before and after initial treatment. The investigation was carried out in a group of 10 men and 10 women who had been hospitalised at the Department of Craniomaxillofacial Surgery because of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Blood samples were collected before and four weeks after initial treatment. Concentrations of HGF were determined in all blood serum samples. In patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma daily oscillations of the mean values of HGF were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers (p &lt; 0.001). Serum concentrations of HGF were significantly higher in those patients who had undergone tumour and regional lymph node resection. Serum HGF levels correlated positively with primary tumour stage. In our study no significant association was observed between HGF levels and histological differentiation, but the daily oscillation of HGF was higher in those with G3 than in those with G2 and G1 status. Our data showed that the changes can be important pathogenic elements involved in the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma and may be a useful marker for clinical monitoring. ","1058":"Observational studies are valuable tools for assessing the applicability of results from randomised controlled trials to broader patient populations. They are especially important in chronic diseases such as diabetes, as they can provide a comprehensive picture of the safety and effectiveness of a particular therapy across cultures and phenotypes. Patients with type 2 diabetes who required insulin and whose physician had decided to initiate biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) were eligible. A total of 4117 type 2 diabetic patients were recruited to the study in Poland, and 809 primary and secondary care physicians were involved. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of BIAsp 30 treatment in type 2 diabetes in routine clinical practice. Baseline glycaemic control was poor in the Polish cohort enrolled in the IMPROVE(TM) study, with a mean HbA(1c) value of 9.0 +\/- 1.7%. A very high proportion of patients were thus at risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. A twice-daily regimen for the start of BIAsp 30 therapy was the most common choice, including 72.2% of patients at baseline. HbA(1c) was significantly reduced by 1.66% for the total cohort and by 3.07% and 1.55% in the pre-study no-therapy or oral antidiabetic drug group respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The rates (episodes per subject year) of overall major hypoglycaemia were 0.012 and 0.12 at follow-up and final visits respectively. For minor hypoglycaemia rates of 5.12 per subject per year at follow-up visit and 4.54 episodes per subject per year at final visit were recorded. BIAsp 30 appears to be an effective and flexible treatment approach and can be safely intensified to achieve glycaemic control in a majority of patients with type 2 diabetes. ","1059":"Glucuronidation is one of the most important metabolic processes which eliminates androgens from the human organism. Three enzymes (UDP-glucuronosyltransferases) are responsible for transfering the glucuronic group from glucuronic acid to androgens: UGT2B7, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17. Glucuronide products are more polar, water soluble, less toxic and easily extracted form the body. Testosterone is a common androgen abused in sport. The norm for urinary testosterone\/epitestosterone ratio is below 4.0. Large testosterone excretion is associated with a deletion polymorphism of the UGT2B17 gene.

Moreover, a peculiarity of constitution causes that some individuals in particular situations respond differently to a drug or treatment than do most people. We report the case of a 68-year-old female with primary aldosteronism treated with spironolactone. The patient occasionally suffered from trigeminal neuralgia and was then prescribed with carbamazepine, which although alleviated pain worsened the control of blood pressure. To maintain blood pressure within normal limits the doses of spironolactone had to be increased. Replacement of carbamazepine with gabapentin prevented these drug-induced increases in blood pressure in our patient. This case shows for the first time the existence of a drug interaction between spironolactone and any anti-epileptic drug in primary aldosteronism.","1061":"Potassium bromate (KBrO(3)) is a compound belonging to Group 2B of carcinogens (a possible human carcinogen). This agent was used as a food additive in flour treatment, as a component of cold-wave hair lotions, and is still used in barley processing. Additionally, KBrO(3) is formed as an oxyhalide by-product during water ozonation. KBrO(3) induces oxidative stress and may contribute to neoplasia in endocrine glands. It has been demonstrated that KBrO(3) triggers thyroid follicular cell tumors in rats. It has been revealed in our in vivo and in vitro studies that KBrO(3) significantly increases lipid peroxidation in rat and porcine thyroid. KBrO(3) also induces mesotheliomas which may secrete hormones or similar substances, such as parathyroid hormone related protein, phosphatonins or melanocyte stimulating hormone. In our experimental studies we demonstrated that antioxidants, such as pineal hormone - melatonin, indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) (a compound chemically and physically similar to melatonin) and antythyroid drug - propylthiouracil (PTU), produce distinct protective effects against lipid peroxidation due to KBrO(3) in the thyroid in vivo. KBrO(3) is a prooxidant which may induce neoplasia in endocrine glands and cause hormonal disturbances, however its damaging effects may be neutralized by hormones, mainly melatonin.","1062":"The goal of diabetes mellitus treatment is to maintain long-term near-normoglycaemia to prevent the onset or progression of long-term complications. In order to achieve tight glycaemic control and improve the quality of life for diabetic patients, a number of novel insulin preparations, insulin analogues, have been constructed thanks to recombinant DNA technologies and advanced protein chemistry. Because structurally modified insulins may differ from human insulin not only in metabolic but also in mitogenic potencies there were concerns raised about the possibility of increased insulin analogue proliferative action or tumourigenesis. In vitro and in vivo studies on insulin analogues in comparison to endogenous insulin have been performed to closely monitor the insulin analogue action profiles. Insulin glargine was the only one presenting a significant increase in affinity to insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) receptor. However, there was controversy regarding the safety of insulin glargine use because of its potential risk of mitogenicity but it proved to be true only for human osteosarcoma cells Saos\/B10.

The study was performed in 152 subjects (20 men and 132 women) referred to Krajowe Centrum Osteoporozy. One-hundred thirty two of them were qualified for pharmacological treatment and 20 for prophylaxis on the basis of qualitative method. The following BTM were examined in all patients: of bone formation - N-terminal propeptide of procolagen type I (PINP) and N-mid osteocalcin (OC) and of bone resorption - C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of collagen type I (CTx). The values over that considered as independent fracture risk (in women only, no data for men) were found in 39 women with PINP, 39 with OC and 41 with CTx. Part of women had decreased serum BTM (10 women 3 BTM and 35 with 1 at least). There were not significant differences in serum BTM depending on the presence of clinical fracture risk factors: osteoporotic fracture in past, osteoporotic hip fracture in parents, chronic treatment with glucocorticosteroids and qualification for pharmacological treatment on the basis of qualitative and FRAX method. There was no significant difference in the presence of fracture risk factors depending on increased or decreased serum BTM. Results of the study did not show the practical use of BTM in qualification for pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis.

According to the MONIKA project by the World Health Organization (WHO), Iran is one of the seven countries with a high rate of child obesity. Fatty liver is an abnormality related to metabolic syndrome, with higher prevalence in obese children according to some previous studies. This study investigates the presence of Sonographic Fatty Liver (SFL) in Iranian obese children in comparison with normal and overweight children. This was a cross-sectional study on 962 randomly selected children between the ages of 6 to 18 years. The subjects were divided into three groups of normal, overweight and obese based on body mass index (BMI). A questionnaire including demographic and anthropometric characteristics was filled for each one. To detect the presence of SFL all the subjects underwent assessments with ultrasonography by radiologist who was not aware of their BMI. The incidence of SFL was determined based on the ultrasonographic diagnosis criteria. The average age of the children in the study was 12.59 +\/- 3.25 years. The mean of the liver span in the normal, overweight and obese groups were 111.36 +\/- 18.73, 121.18 +\/- 16.63 and 118.21 +\/- 19.15 respectively. The prevalence of SFL in obese children was 54.4%, which was significantly higher than overweight (10.5%) and normal ones (1%). According to present results, there was no significant difference in prevalence of SFL between sexes. The high rate of detected SFL in obese children in this study suggests that Iranian obese children are at risk of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, the WHO indicated Iran as one of the countries with high rate of obese children. Based on this information, we can conclude that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its related non-communicable diseases will be increasing future in . Therefore, it is necessary to develop some plan to control overweight problem including teaching healthy lifestyle in schools and kindergartens as well as mass media.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the plasma blood concentrations of VEGF, sVEGFR1, and sVEGFR2 in patients with benign and malignant adrenal tumours treated by surgery. We studied the blood before surgery of 41 patients with adrenal cortex tumours and 10 normal subjects without hormonal or CT\/USG pathology of the adrenal glands (controls). We studied the blood after adrenalectomy of 16 patients with tumours of the adrenal cortex. Concentrations of VEGF, sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2 in blood plasma before as well as 30 days after surgery were evaluated by ELISA. VEGF blood concentrations before surgery did not differ in the patients with the cortical tumours as compared to the controls. After surgery VEGF concentrations decreased among the patients, taken in total, with adrenal cortex tumours and cortical adenomas. Before surgery sVEGFR1 blood concentrations were increased in the patients with Conn's syndrome only in comparison with the controls. After surgery, sVEGFR1 concentrations decreased significantly in the group with cortical adenomas only. Before and after surgery sVEGFR2 blood concentrations did not differ between the groups of patients studied and the controls. Peripheral blood concentrations of VEGF and its receptors cannot be clinically valuable markers that discriminate between benign and malignant adrenocortical tumours before and after adrenalectomy.

This study describes a series of patients with blunt AGI, with the emphasis on AGI as a marker of injury severity, CT-radiographic classification of AGI and associated injury patterns. A retrospective review of blunt trauma patients with AGI was performed. Variables examined included demographics, mechanism of injury, length of hospital and ICU stay, clinical status on admission, AGI characteristics, associated injuries, complications, procedures, mortality and discharge disposition. There were 29 AGI patients with a mean injury severity score of 25. The most common injury mechanisms were motor-vehicular collisions (15\/29) and falls (5\/29). Right-sided AGI (16\/29) outnumbered left-sided (12\/29) injuries. The most common CT-radiographic types of AGI were adrenal gland contusions and lacerations with limited \"blush\". While patterns of injuries differed between right and left-sided AGI, the mean number of injuries did not. The most common associated injuries included extremity (21\/29), rib (20\/29) and spinal fractures (18\/29). Common procedures included orthopaedic fixation (10\/29), vena cava filter (8\/29) and tracheostomy (5\/29). A median of two complications per patient was reported, including adrenal insufficiency in two patients. Mortality was 17%. The median hospital and ICU length of stay were 15 and 12 days, respectively. Adrenal gland injury is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. With modern imaging modalities capable of reliably detecting adrenal injury, the presence of AGI should be considered a marker of overall injury severity.

It may occur either sporadically (75%) or in familial forms (25%) in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B. Distinct clinical phenotypes in hereditary medullary thyroid cancer result from different missense germline mutations in the RET protooncogene. Medullary thyroid cancer produce calcitonin, measurement of which indicates the presence of tumour in at-risk individuals and the effectiveness of management in treated patients. Prognosis of patients with medullary thyroid cancer is variable, but the more constant factors that affect it are the stage of disease and the age of the patient. The goal of treatment of patients suffering from medullary thyroid cancer is to detect and surgically remove disease at its early stage. Total thyroidectomy with local nodal dissection leads to achievement of biochemical cure in more than 80% of cases. The tumour does not take up radioactive iodine, is relatively radioresistant, and there is no known effective systemic therapy for this cancer. The purpose of this article is to summarise the present state of knowledge on the etiology, clinical presentation, management, prognosis, and genetics of medullary thyroid cancer.","1069":"Our present investigation demonstrates that in adolescents with various impaired glucose homeostasis oral antidiabetic agents can be used to improve glucose metabolism. Metformin is widely used in pediatric patients and is considered to be the most effective oral agent. Metformin is beneficial in improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, in lowering insulinemia, and in reducing elevated androgen levels. Addition of metformin to insulin in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus improves metabolic control. Metformin acts by promoting glucose utilization and reducing hepatic glucose production. In many patients with type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia can be reduced with appropriate changes in diet and exercise, however, some patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance syndromes need pharmacological therapy to improve their metabolic control. The first oral agent concerned to use should be metformin. More severe pancreatic b-cell dysfunction in the group of children requires insulin therapy. Some forms of monogenic diabetes can be successfully managed by sulphonylurea agents. Metformin should be considered a first-line agent in girls with PCOS.","1070":"Hormones have an influence on many tissues and organs, including the cardio-vascular system (CVS). Depending on their activity on CVS, they can be divided into 4 groups: having hypertensive or hypotensive influence and chronotropic positive or negative action. Endocrine regulation in CVS may occur in many ways. Apart from hormones usually connected with CVS regulation, other more recently, discovered ones can act on it. A few of these act directly through specific receptors in heart or vessel wall cells, whereas some act indirectly - stimulating other neuroendocrine factors. Additionally, novel mechanisms of signal transduction have been discovered for steroid and thyroid hormones, which are independent of gene transcription regulation and are - known as \"nongenomic\". Hormones which increase blood pressure include: urotensin II, endothelins, angiotensin II, catecholamines, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, glucocorticosteroids, thyroid hormones, growth hormone and leptin. On the other hand, blood pressure can be decreased by: natriuretic peptides, the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) family, angiotensin 1-7, substance P, neurokinin A, ghrelin, Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), oxytocin, and, sex hormones. Hormones which when appearing in excess increase the heart rate are: catecholamines, endothelins, glucocorticosteroids, thyroid hormones, leptin and PTHrP. Those which decrease the heart rate include: natriuretic peptides, substance P, neurokinin A, oxytocin, angiotensin 1-7. This paper describes the contemporary view of the functions of hormones which act on the vessel tree and heart. The particular effect of mediator depends on many circumstances i.e.: hormone concentration, receptor type. It may also undergo contraregulation. The majority of those hormones play an important role in the pathogenesis of CVS diseases', which can result in the development of new medicines.","1071":"The research carried out in Poland reflected that sexual initiation before 18 years of age is a common phenomenon and refers to roughly 80% of teenagers. In Poland there is no uniform standing of medical and legal environments with regard to dealing with a juvenile patient who has become sexually active and expects the advice of a gynaecologist, gynaecologic examination and often asks for prescribing contraceptives. The procedures must take into account the fact that in Poland, until 18 years of age, a juvenile functions under the parental or tutelary authority, while a consent for medical service requires beside of the consent of legal guardian also the consent of a juvenile who is 16 years of age and becomes a full-right patient. According to the Act on Health Care Institutions, a patient has the right to self-decisions, the respect of physical and mental integrity and the respect of privacy, while the participation of a statutory representative post 16th year of age refers practically to co-deciding on a medical service provision. Therefore, the information received from such juvenile patient in subjective and objective examination does not have to be passed to the statutory representative, if the juvenile patient requires confidentiality and if this does not affect the patient's health and the planned medical procedures (e.g. the necessity of making an operation). The knowledge of conduct procedures with regard to a juvenile patient as a carrier of rights shall enable doctors to make aware choices of conduct and provide services or, in most cases, only advice, without the necessity to breach the laws of Poland.","1072":"The purpose of the study was to evaluate salivary gland dysfunction after a high-dose radioiodine therapy administered to patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The study group consisted of 60 patients (age range 20-78 years). Detailed history about complaints from the oral cavity were taken, followed by the ultrasonography and dynamic scintigraphy. The procedure was performed on 40 patients before and one year after radioiodine administration, and a single-time on 20 patients treated with multiple doses in the past. Data analysis shows no statistically significant increase of subjective sufferings after first radioiodine dose (60-150 mCi), small decrease of uptake ratio UR (&lt; 10%) and diminished parotid glands transverse diameter (approximately 10%). The patients after multiple therapies (i.e. average dose of 250 mCi) informed more often about problems connected with decreased salivation (approximately 20% patients), in scintigraphy there was a reduction of parotid UR 21-23% and parotid maximal secretion MS 7-13%. Ultrasonography did not show changes in salivary glands echogenicity after 12 months from the first dose of 131I. There was no close relationship between scintigraphically revealed dysfunctions and the occurrence of complaints; no correlation between appearance of acute sialadenitis symptoms after radioiodine therapy and subsequent dysfunctions. The main conclusion is that a single dose of 131I has no significant influence on salivary gland function; a repeated high-doses therapy is connected with an essential risk of side-effect occurrence. Scintigraphy can evaluate salivary gland function with high sensitivity. Parotid glands are more radiosensitive than submandibular.

The controls were 1160 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Multifactorial analysis was performed and odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each risk factor identified. The GDM patients were significantly older than the NGT subjects (30.1 vs. 27.2 years; p &lt; 0.0001), had a greater tendency towards obesity before pregnancy (BMI 25.0 vs. 21.6 kg\/m2; p &lt; 0.0001), more often had relatives with diabetes (40.0 vs. 25.7%; p &lt; 0.01), had greater parity (third or subsequent pregnancy: 33.6 vs. 16.0%; p &lt; 0.001) and more often experienced adverse perinatal outcomes (21.4 vs. 13.7%; p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed the following risk factors for GDM: BMI &gt; 25 kg\/m2 (OR 4.14), a history of macrosomia (OR 2.72), being pregnant for the third time or more (OR 1.8), a family history of diabetes (OR 1.76) and age at gestation &gt; 25 years (OR 1.34). No risk factors were present in 12% of GDM subjects, and at least one risk factor was found in 74.1% of subjects with NGT. No risk factor cluster was found which could be used easily in everyday practice to identify reliably subjects at increased risk of GDM. Age, overweight and obesity, diabetes in the family, parity, macrosomia and a history of perinatal complications were identified as risk factors for GDM. As no reliable method of identifying subjects at increased GDM risk was found, we suggest that all pregnant women should undergo laboratory screening for GDM. ","1075":"Hyperandrogenism may be implicated in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. We hypothesised that there may be a difference between the levels of testosterone in pregnant women complicated with pre-eclampsia and those of matched women without this complication. A case-control study conducted in Tehran, Iran between January and June 2006 included 20 women with moderate to severe pre-eclampsia and 20 normotensive pregnant women without complications who were matched for age, body mass index and gravity. Maternal levels of free testosterone was measured in the two groups and compared. Free testosterone levels were significantly higher in the pre-eclamptic group (mean = 1.97, SD = 0.58, median = 1.90 ng\/dL) than in the control group (mean = 0.58, SD = 0.29, median=0.50 ng\/dL) (P &lt; 0.001). An increase in serum free testosterone concentration may be considered an important risk factor for pre-eclampsia and might be implicated in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. ","1076":"Our aim was to assess the usefulness of fine-needle aspiration cytologic biopsy (FNA) of the thyroid in our general teaching hospital with average health care facility performing moderate number of such procedures and to evaluate the outcome of Indeterminate Cytologic Results. We studied on all consecutive patients referred for FNA of the thyroid nodule. All samplings were performed primarily by one endocrinologist performing moderate number of samplings and interpreted by one pathologist. Cytological findings were classified as malignant, histologic control recommended (suspicious or indeterminate), benign, and unsatisfactory. Four hundred and seventy six biopsies were performed. Patient acceptance of this procedure was good and no complication was encountered. 64\/476 of samples were considered as insufficient (13.4%). Of the remaining samples (355 F, 57 M), 321 specimens (67.4%) were reported to be non-neoplastic lesions, including 251 (52.7%) colloid nodules, 39 (8.2%) hemorrhagic nodules and 31 (6.5%) cases of thyroiditis. A neoplastic nodule was confirmed in 91\/476 of cases (19.1%), of which 14 were cytologically malignant (3.0%). Follicular lesions were identified in the remaining 77\/476 cases (16.1%). Excluding 21 patients who were lost to follow-up, the remaining 56 patients (72.7%) were surgically followed up. Upon excision, benign lesions were diagnosed in 47\/56 (83.8%), of which 32 lesions (57.1%) were follicular adenoma and 15 cases (26.7%) of colloid nodules. Malignancy was confirmed histopathologically in 9 cases (16.2%), including 4 follicular variant papillary carcinomas and 5 follicular carcinomas. FNA is an inexpensive, safe, practical, well tolerated, and easily applied method, even in not fully-experienced hands and provides useful information. Based on our study findings, suspicious cytologic results (cytologically follicular neoplasms) are inconclusive and are associated with a remarkable chance of malignant involvement; hence surgical treatment is necessary for clarification. ","1077":"The Quality of Life Assessment of Growth Hormone Deficiency in Adults (QoL-AGHDA) was developed simultaneously in five languages (English, Swedish, German, Italian and Spanish) to measure quality of life (QoL) in adult patients with Growth Hormone (GH) deficiency. The aim of the project was to produce a validated Polish version of the QoL-AGHDA that was conceptually equivalent to the UK-English version. Translation and validation procedure consisted of 4 stages. Stage 1: A bilingual translation panel [7 participants, fluent in both English and Polish (Polish as their first language) with university education] translated the questionnaire. Stage 2: A lay translation panel (6 participants of an average to lower than average educational level, speaking only the target language) reviewed the wording of the draft version produced by bilingual panel to improve clarity and immediacy. Stage 3: The translated questionnaire was then field-tested with 15 adults with GH deficiency. Stage 4: Finally, the amended version underwent psychometric evaluation to check its reliability and validity (it was administered to 85 GH-deficient adults on two occasions, two weeks apart). The Polish QoL-AGHDA version was successfully adapted and it is characterized by a high degree of reliability and validity. The test-retest reliability coefficient for the Polish QoL-AGHDA was 0.92. The Cronbach's Alpha coefficient for the Polish QoL-AGHDA was 0.91 (N = 70) at Time 1 and 0.94 (N = 79) at Time 2. Correlation between QoL-AGHDA and Nottingham Health Profile items confirmed high convergent and divergent validity. The Polish QoL-AGHDA is a reliable and valid measure of QoL suitable for use in clinical studies and routine clinical practice. ","1078":"Congenital defects of adrenal steroidogenesis comprises a group of autosomally recessive disorders, which are usually caused by inactivating mutations in single enzymes involved in adrenal steroid biosynthesis. Each of the defects causes different biochemical consequences and clinical features. A different degree of enzyme dysfunction is responsible for a wide range of phenotypic expression even in the same disorder. The basis for the diagnosis of inborn errors of steroidogenesis are often refined methods for steroid determination. Because these defects may result in life-threatening conditions and, if not treated, lead to serious complications, its is essential to consider their presence in a differential diagnosis of various symptoms. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, the most common of these disorders, has been recently extensively reviewed. Therefore, this paper discusses the etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestation, biochemical abnormalities and management of other less frequent defects of adrenal steroidogenesis.","1079":"Ectopic acromegaly is a very rare clinical entity occurring in less than 1% of acromegalic patients. In most cases it is caused by GHRH or rarely GH-secreting neoplasms. Even rarer are ectopic pituitary adenomas located in the sphenoid sinus or nasopharynx that originate from pituitary remnants in the craniopharyngeal duct. This dissertation presents the difficulties in visualizing GH-secreting adenoma located in the sphenoid sinus. A 55-year-old man had somatic features of acromegaly for several years. MRI imaging revealed a slightly asymmetric pituitary gland (14 yen 4 mm) without focal lesions. Simultaneously, a spherical mass, 10 mm in diameter, corresponding with ectopic microadenoma was demonstrated on the upper wall of the sphenoid sinus. The serum GH level was 4.3 mg\/l, IGF-1 = 615 mg\/l, and a lack of GH suppression with oral glucose was proven. After preliminary treatment with a long-acting somatostatin analogue, transsphenoidal pituitary tumour removal was performed. Histopathological, electron microscopical and immunohistochemical analysis revealed densely granulated somatotropic pituitary adenoma: GH(+), PRL(-), ACTH(-), TSH(-), FSH(-), LH(-), MIB1 &lt; 1%, SSTR3(+) and SSTR5(+). Post-surgical evaluation showed normal pituitary MRI scans, GH and IGF-1 levels 0.18 mug\/l and 140 mg\/l, respectively, as well as normal GH suppression with oral glucose. The careful analysis of possible pituitary embryonic malformations points out their significance for proper localization of extrapituitary adenomas.","1080":"Patients with carcinoid tumours frequently present with metastatic disease. There are only a few therapeutic options for these patients, and the main goal of palliative treatment is to reduce symptoms and thus to improve quality of life. Current therapy includes surgical resection, hepatic artery embolisation, chemotherapy and somatostatin analogue treatment; however, all these options have limitations. It seems probable that therapeutic modalities based on radiopharmaceuticals may provide better therapy, not only in relation to symptom reduction but may also improve patient survival. In this case report we present a 46-year-old woman with a symptomatic carcinoid, who at the time of diagnosis had liver and abdominal lymph node metastases, the primary tumour being located in the terminal ileum. (111)In-pentetreotide scanning was negative, whereas (123)I-MIBG scanning showed high avidity in the tumour tissue. After right hemicolectomy, two courses of (131)I-MIBG treatment were given (12.95 GBq and 12 GBq, respectively). After the second dose of (131)I-MIBG temporary pancytopenia was present. Octreotide therapy was given empirically only for a short time and was stopped because of drug intolerance. The patient underwent tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacement because of her carcinoid heart disease, followed by two courses of embolisation of liver metastases. While (131)I-MIBG therapy reduced the patient's symptoms of flushing and diarrhoea, there has not yet been any effect on tumour response or 5-HIAA production. This case illustrates the multimodality and multidisciplinary approach to such patients.","1081":"The aim of the study is to present genes encoding enzymatic proteins of aldosterone and cortisol synthesis pathway, methods of their transcriptional activity measurement, mRNA expression of the genes in normal adrenal cortex, in adrenocortical adenomas excised from patients with Conn and Cushing syndromes, as well as in adrenocortical adenomas excised from patients, in which hormonal activity of the tumour was not confirmed. According to presented papers mRNA expression of analyzed genes is best known in tissue obtained from tumours excised from patients with Conn syndrome. On the other hand transcriptional activity of the genes within the other adrenocortical adenomas is documented in lesser degree. It concerns particularly analyses of tissue material obtained from patients, in which hormonal activity of adrenal tumours was not confirmed with biochemical tests. It should be also considered, that the frame of reference for the majority of molecular analyses of adrenocortical tumour tissues was material obtained from little number of normal adrenals, what decreases in some degree credibility of obtained results. Mentioned above remarks may be the basis for conduction of further investigations based on larger material, obtained both from normal adrenals and adrenocortical adenomas.","1082":"In the pathogenesis of diabetes type 2, increasing insulin resistance is accompanied by dysfunction of pancreatic islet b cells. It is hypothesized that at the basis of this pathology lies an incretin defect of insulinotropic gut-derived hormones, relying on decreased secretion of GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1), with preserved insulinotropic effect, whereas GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) secretion remains within physiological limits, but its action is mostly impaired due to total loss of possibility for stimulation of the second phase insulin secretion. Possibilities for pharmacological correction of incretin defect create an opportunity of causative treatment of diabetes and provide basis for development of research on a new group of drugs which promote hypoglycemia. In the presence of these findings there are many ongoing clinical studies with the use of GLP-1 analogues or GLP-1 receptors activators (GLP-1 agonists), as well as the inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), the enzyme responsible for incretin proteolysis, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Multidirectional, glucoregulative mechanism of action of these drugs, aiming at the pathogenesis of the disease, restores the proper function of the intestinal-pancreatic axis in subjects with type 2 diabetes and ensures good metabolic control and improvement in quality of life in this group of patients.","1083":"Thyroid nodules not detected in palpation but diagnosed following a radiological procedure or during surgery are called thyroid incidentalomas. We designed this study to investigate the prevalence of sonographic thyroid incidentaloma in Isfahan, Iran, for the first time. By a multistage cluster sampling method, 2523 adults were selected randomly. From this group, 2045 had normal thyroid examination. 234 out of the 2045 were selected randomly for thyroid sonography. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), urinary iodine concentrations (UIC) and antithyroid antibodies were measured. The prevalence of thyroid incidentaloma was 13.2% [Confidence interval (CI) 95% = 8-18]. The average age of subjects with and without incidentaloma was 46.1 (12.4) and 38.4 (12.1), respectively (P = 0.002). It was more prevalent in females than in males (19% vs. 10%) [Odds ratio (OR) = 2.59, CI 95% = 1.17-5.76, P value (P) = 0.01]. Median UIC in the incidentaloma group (14 microg\/dl) was significantly lower than in the group of subjects without nodules (20 microg\/dl) (OR = 0.9, CI 95% = 0.91-0.99, P = 0.02). There was no difference in the levels of TSH and antithyroid antibodies between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). Mean diameter of nodules was 8.14 (3.43) mm.

","1084":"The aim of this study was to examine the association of Pro12Ala PPARgamma2 polymorphism with anthropometric and biochemical parameters defining the risk for the development of metabolic syndrome in a healthy population of men. The study group consisted of 176 healthy men, aged 25-65 years (average 54.16 years). Polymorphisms of the PPAR-g gene (Pro12Ala, Ala12Ala, Pro12Pro) were explored using the PCR-RFLP method. Plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and TG were measured using commercially available kits. The genotypic distribution of the Pro12Ala polymorphism was as follows: Pro\/Ala 69.8% (n = 123), Ala\/Ala 28.4% (n = 50) and Pro\/Pro 1.8% (n = 3). The Pro12Ala and Ala12Ala subjects did not differ in any of the measured variables. The non-obese (BMI &lt; 30 kg\/m(2), n = 117) and obese subpopulations (BMI &gt; 30 kg\/m(2), n = 56) did not significantly differ in the distribution of the genotypes. In the nonobese subpopulation, the homozygous Ala12 carriers (n = 38, 32.4%) had higher systolic blood pressure, plasma triglycerides, insulin levels and HOMA-IR. We conclude that despite the high frequency of the Ala allele at the PPAR-gamma2 gene in our population of Polish men, the Ala12 allele does not appear to improve insulin sensitivity or have an influence on the occurrence of obesity. It remains to be explained by larger studies if this polymorphism carries any risk of the development of metabolic abnormalities in non-obese men. ","1085":"Secretory products from adipocytes may contribute to deterioration in glycaemic control and increased insulin resistance (IR). Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP-4) may increase IR in mice, with elevated levels in insulin-resistant mice and humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms regulating RBP-4 synthesis remain not fully understood. It is not clear whether short-term glucose-induced hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia as well as glucocorticosteroid-induced increase in IR might be reflected in alterations in serum RBP-4 levels in humans. In order to investigate this, we measured serum RBP-4, glucose and insulin concentrations during 75.0 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) - Study 1, as well as before and after oral administration of dexamethasone - Study 2. Both studies included 35 subjects (8 males), age (mean +\/- SD) 39.1 +\/- 15.6 years, BMI 35.8 +\/- 8.7 kg\/m(2). Twenty-four of those subjects (5 males), age 38.7 +\/- 15.1 years, BMI 34.4 +\/- 8.3 kg\/m(2), had 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) - Study 1. Blood samples were taken before (0 minutes), and at 60 and 120 minutes of OGTT. 17 subjects (3 males, 4 subjects with type 2 diabetes), age 43.1 +\/- 18.1 years, BMI 36.7 +\/- 9.0 kg\/m(2) underwent screening for Cushing's disease\/syndrome (Study 2). Dexamethasone was administered in a dose of 0.5 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Fasting serum concentrations of RBP-4, glucose and insulin were assessed before (D0) and after 48 hours of dexamethasone administration (D2). IR was assessed by HOMA in all non-diabetic subjects and in subjects participating in study 1 also by Insulin Resistance Index (IRI), which takes into account glucose and insulin levels during OGTT. Glucose administration resulted in significant increases in insulin and glucose (p &lt; 0.0001). There was, however, no change in RBP-4 concentrations (124.1 +\/- 32 mg\/ml at 0 minutes, 123 +\/- 35 mg\/ml at 60 minutes and 126.5 +\/- 37.5 mg\/ml at 120 minutes of OGTT, p = ns). All subjects in Study 2 achieved suppression of cortisol below 50 nmo\/l. Dexamethasone administration resulted in an increase in fasting insulin (from 11.6 +\/- 6.8 to 17.1 +\/- 7.2 muU\/ml; p = 0.003), and an increase in HOMA (from 2.73 +\/- 1.74 to 4.02 +\/- 2.27; p = 0.015), although without a significant change in RBP-4 levels (119 +\/- 26.8 vs. 117.5 +\/- 24.8 mg\/ml, p = ns). RBP-4 correlated with fasting insulin (r = 0.40, p = 0.025), fasting glucose (r = 0.41, p = 0.02) and HOMA (r = 0.43, p = 0.015), but not with IRI (r = 0.19, p = 0.31). There was, however, only a moderate correlation between HOMA and IRI (r = 0.49 [r(2) = 0.24]; p = 0.006, Spearman rank correlation), while the best correlation was obtained between the product of glucose and insulin levels at 60 min of OGTT and IRI in a non-linear model (r = 0.94 [r(2) = 0.88]; p&lt;0.00001). In subjects who received dexamethasone, a positive correlation between RBP-4 and HOMA (p = 0.01) was lost after two days of dexamethasone administration (p = 0.61). RBP-4 levels do not change during oral glucose tolerance test or after a dexamethasone-induced increase in insulin resistance. This implies that it is highly unlikely that RBP-4 is involved in short-term regulation of glucose homeostasis in humans and that it responds to short-term changes in insulin resistance. A moderate correlation between RBP-4 and some insulin resistance indices (HOMA) does not exclude the fact that RBP-4 might be one of many factors that can influence insulin sensitivity in humans. ","1086":"The aim of the present study was to examine how weight loss treatment modulates plasma concentrations of ghrelin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in obese women and to determine whether there is any association with possible changes in plasma concentrations of these hormones after weight loss.

The measurements were performed at baseline and after weight loss. Plasma concentration of ghrelin and IGF-1 were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Serum concentrations of insulin were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Body composition was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis using a Bodystat analyser. The mean weight loss was 9.3 +\/- 4.1 kg (9.7 +\/- 4.3%).

The aim of the study was the selection of patients with confirmed severe GHD from among all the children treated due to GHD, who could benefit from GH therapy continuation in adulthood and the optimization of GH dosage in young adults with severe GHD. The study group consisted of 54 young adults (38 male), age 17.6 +\/- 1.5 years, with childhood-onset GHD, who had reached final height. At least 1 month after the GH therapy withdrawal, the second evaluation of GH secretion was performed in all the patients. In 24% of patients, permanent severe GHD (PSGHD) was confirmed, but a group of 9 patients (4 male) was involved in renewed GH therapy. The renewed GH therapy gave positive effects, including a significant increase in fat-free mass and a decrease in fat mass, and a significant decrease in LDL-cholesterol, but connected with an insignificant decrease of HDL-cholesterol serum concentration and improved results of quality of life (QoL) assessment. During the therapy, an insignificant increase of fasting insulin was observed, with no change in fasting glucose and only a slight increase in HbA(1c) percentage. A decrease of insulin sensitivity was also observed, but both insulin secretion and the values of insulin resistance indices still remained within the reference range. The observed positive effects on body composition, lipid metabolism and QoL, together with the absence of adverse events, confirm the indications for GH therapy in young adults with severe GHD. ","1088":"","1089":"","1090":"","1091":"In recent years, insulin analogues are the benefits of the use in functional intensive insulin therapy for the treatment of diabetes. Shortacting insulin (lispro, aspart and glulisine) and long-acting insulin (glargine and detemir) have been developed for the management of diabetes. Short-acting insulin analogues are an alternative to regular human insulin before meals. These new short-acting insulin analogues show more rapid onset of activity and a shorter duration of action. As a result of these pharmacokinetic differences, an improved postprandial glycemic control is achieved, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. In addition, these insulin analogues can be administered immediately before a meal. The long-acting insulin analogues provide basal insulin levels for 24 h when administered once (glargine) or two (detemir) daily. Compared with previous intermediate- or long-acting conventional insulin, these insulins shows a flat profile of plasma insulin levels . The use of these long-acting insulin analogues appears to be associated with a reduced incidence of hypoglycemia, especially at night. The availability of these new insulin analogues has the potential to significantly improve long-term control over blood glucose in diabetic patients. In recent years more and more frequently the method of multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin is being replaced by the method of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). It is the most physiological way to administer insulin. In recent years treatment with insulin pumps has been used more frequently in the pediatric patients and in the treatment of diabetes in pregnancy. Use of continuous glucose monitoring systems enables detection of glycemia fluctuations unrevealed by selfmonitoring of blood glucose, such as night hypoglycemias and early postprandial hyperglycemias. Real-time systems allow to reduce HbA1c levels and limit number of excursions. Non-invasive glucose measurement devices are introduced. Fully automated continuous glucose monitoring systems integrated with insulin pumps operating in closed-loop model, requiring no patient assistance, are still being researched. Commercially available systems operate in open-loop model, where the patient has to decide on administration and dose of insulin.","1092":"The authors present numerous historical descriptions of persons who might suffered from gigantism or acromegaly.

In one patient 131I-MIBG was administrated after ineffective surgical treatment and chemotherapy of a benign retroperitoneal tumor, whereas in two other patients 131I-MIBG therapy was carried out because of malignant pheochromocytoma dissemination. In a child with retroperitoneal paraganglioma decrease of tumor size and its fibrosis after 131I-MIBG therapy allowed radical surgery and complete recovery. In two other cases partial remission was achieved. All patients showed a good subjective response with improvement of the general condition and better blood pressure control. In two children adverse reactions such as leucopenia, hypothyroidism or hypogonadism were observed. The presented data confirm effectiveness and acceptable tolerance of 131I-MIBG treatment in pheochromocytoma, what is very important in pediatric patients.","1094":"We present the clinical, laboratory, radiological and pathological findings in the case and review the literature. Our patient, a 37-year-old woman of short stature, was referred because of musculoskeletal pain. After primary evaluation, she underwent treatment with calcium and vitamin D supplement with the diagnosis of osteomalacia in Turner's syndrome. The rise of serum calcium during medical therapy, which was an unusual finding, attracted the clinician's attention to another underlying disorder. Further evaluation revealed primary hyperparathyroidism due to an adenoma of the parathyroid gland. Even though this is a rare diagnosis, its presence should be considered in any patient with Turner's syndrome presenting with severe osteoporosis and a rise in serum calcium during treatment.","1095":"Chronic complications of diabetes are associated mainly with changes in major and small arterial vessels as well as in peripheral and autonomic fibers of the nervous system. For years it has been suggested that DM2 does not predispose to osteoporosis because bone mineral density (BMD) in DM2 patients is commonly normal or even increased. However, results of recent large cross-sectional studies have indicated that patients with DM2 have significantly increased risk of bone fractures, predominantly hip fractures (by 70%). Results of these studies suggest that the increased risk of fractures in DM2 is independent of BMD. In this group of patients is frequently associated the loss of vision caused by diabetic eye disease, peripheral neuropathy, arterial hypertension, orthostatic hypotonia (caused by autonomic neuropathy or\/and by concomitant antihypertensive treatment), and ischemic disease of the brain, heart and lower extremities--conditions that predispose to falls. There are no specific methods of prophylaxis and treatment of osteoporosis associated with diabetes; therefore they should be based on widely accepted principles as in non-diabetic populations. It seems that in DM2 patients the most purposeful strategy could be the popularization of healthy attitudes aiming the elimination of unfavorable dietetic and environmental factors, such as low physical activity, smoking, and low vitamin D intake, as well as education against falls.","1096":"Both bone and adipose tissue change their size, shape and distribution during the whole human being's life.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between the Gly972Arg polymorphism in the IRS-1 gene and birth weight in newborn children with adequate gestational age. 100 newborn children with adequate gestational age (38-42 weeks), whose mother had no disorders during pregnancy, were studied. Genomic DNA was extracted from umbilical cord blood leukocytes, and Gly972Arg polymorphism in the IRS-1 gene was genotyped using the PCR-based method. Birth weight was significantly lower in the newborn with the IRS-1 Gly972Arg polymorphism compared with a control group (3161.75 +\/- 380.86 g vs. 3427.92 +\/- 468.86 g). Body length and head circumference at birth were also lower in the neonates with that polymorphism (54.38 +\/- 3.13 cm vs. 52.69 +\/- 2.91 cm, and 34.08 +\/- 1.47 vs. 33.63 +\/- 0.81, respectively).

","1099":"Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent, effective in the treatment of leukaemias, lymphomas and many solid tumours. However, its clinical usage is often limited by cardiotoxicity, induced by oxygen radical damage of the membrane lipids. Melatonin (MEL) is a well-known antioxidant. It has been shown that MEL can scavenge free radicals, both directly and indirectly, stimulating the activity of antioxidative enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). The aim of the study was to examine the effect of MEL on serum and erythrocyte GSH-Px activity after ADR in normal and pinealectomised rats. Wistar rats were divided into the three groups: control animals (Intact), sham-operated (Sham-PX) and pinealectomised (Px). Each of the groups was divided into four subgroups, injected with: 1--saline, 2--MEL, 3--ADR and 4--ADR + MEL. ADR was administered 2 months after Px as a single dose (15 mg\/kg, i.p.) 1 hour after the fourth melatonin injection. Melatonin (5 mg\/kg, i.p.) was administered for 4 days before and 2 days after ADR. After 6 days of treatment, the rats were killed by decapitation. Their blood was collected for measurements. In serum GSH-Px activity decreased in all the groups after ADR. Pinealectomy decreased the activity of the enzyme in all the groups of animals examined. In erythrocytes GSH-Px decreased after ADR in the Px-animals. The effect of pinealectomy on erythrocyte GSH-Px activity was not as strongly expressed as serum GSH-Px activity. MEL did not change GSH-Px activity after ADR. Melatonin, in pharmacological concentrations, did not influence the activity of GSH-Px, either in normal or in pinealectomised rats after ADR. A deficiency of endogenous melatonin production may inhibit GSH-Px activity. ","1100":"Twenty pituitary adenomas, surgically removed from patients suffering from acromegaly, were studied. The tumours were immunostained with anti-GH and anti-PRL antibodies and with antibodies raised against particular subtypes of somatostatin receptors (rsst1-5). Expression of rsst immunoreactivity was scored using the following scale: 0--negative reaction, 1--weak reaction, 2--moderate reaction, 3--strong reaction. In 15 patients in whom the GH response to the acute administration of 200 ug octreotide was tested the correlation between the expression of rsst and the percentage of GH drop was estimated. All the tumours were GH-immunopositive and in the majority (14\/20) co-expression of PRL was also found. All the adenomas examined expressed rsst2A (20\/20) and rsst5 (12\/12) receptor proteins. Receptors sst2B and rsst3 were found in all but one of the tumours examined (19\/20 and 11\/12, respectively). None of tumours investigated presented rsst4 immunopositivity. The mixed (GH\/PRL) adenomas showed a tendency to a higher expression of rsst2A + + rsst2B and a greater response to octreotide administration. A significant positive correlation was found between rsst2A + rsst2B expressions and a drop in GH after octreotide. To conclude, the GH-inhibiting effect of octreotide depends on the intensity of expression of both rsst2A and rsst2B. Both isoforms of rsst2 mediate the same biological response (inhibition of GH secretion) in GH-secreting and GH\/PRL-secreting adenomas.","1101":"Postpartum thyroiditis is a form of autoimmune thyroiditis developing during the first 12 months postpartum as a consequence of the immunologic flare following the immune suppression of pregnancy. This disease, found in 5-10% of women in a general population and even more frequently in patients suffering from other autoimmune disorders, may re-occur in about 70% of women after a subsequent pregnancy. Postpartum thyroiditis is strongly associated with antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. Patients may present with symptoms of either thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism which may be transient or, in some (20-30%) cases of hypothyroidism, permanent in nature. A thyrotoxic phase of postpartum thyroiditis is usually brief and often unnoticed before a more long-lasting hypothyroid phase occurs. The diagnosis of postpartum thyroiditis is based on the observation of abnormal thyroid function tests in a postpartum antithyroid peroxidase- positive woman. In this paper, we discuss the etiopathogenesis, clinical picture, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of postpartum thyroiditis and provide the reader with some practical guidance concerning dealing with a patient suffering from this disorder.","1102":"The impact of thyroid hormones upon the proper function of central nervous system has been known for many years. The neurological symptoms and psychiatric disturbances may occur both in case of hypo- as well as hyperthyreosis. The encephalopathy Hashimoto (EH) described in this paper is a rare illness which occurs in case of patients suffering from the autoimmunological thyroid disease and increased level of antibodies in serum without any connections to the thyroid function. It is characterised by a variety of neurological symptoms and psychotic disturbances, acute state, high re-occurrence and good reaction to glicocorticosteroid treatment. Although we face encephalopathy Hashimoto extremely rarely in the clinical practice one should remember about it during the diagnostic process because when it is a long lasting untreated illness it may lead to the irreversible changes in the central nervous system.","1103":"The peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors gamma (PPAR) belong to the family of nuclear receptors, which directly regulate transcription of target genes. PPARgamma take part in many processes such as adipogenesis, glucose and lipid metabolism, atherosclerosis and inflammation and carcinogenesis. The expression of PPARgamma was detected in normal and tumor cells of endocrine glands. Activation of receptors by specific ligands of PPARgamma induces inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and terminal differentiation as well as inhibition of angiogenesis. In the present paper the structure, tissue expression and biological function of PPARgamma are presented. The reports about oncostatic effects of PPARgamma agonists in pituitary adenomas, thyroid cancers and adrenal tumor are reviewed.","1104":"Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by conscious restriction of food intake, which causes numerous metabolic and hormonal disorders. Knowledge of these changes is important due to growing morbidity and mortality of anorexia. Treatment is difficult and requires cooperation of a group of specialists, including an endocrinologist. The authors presented a clinical picture, view of etiopathogenesis and typical disorders found in patients with this illness. Furthermore, treatment methods were also discussed.","1105":"The most frequent physical features associated with Turner syndrome is short stature. The main goal of the research was to estimate the height of women with Turner syndrome and to analyze the correlation between their height and their sisters and parents height. The research was based on the 176 women with Turner syndrome (number of parents = 176; number of sisters = 122). The data was collected from 1995 to 2002 in Out-patient Clinic for Women with Turner's Syndrome in Bytom. Average height in the group of women non treated with growth hormone and anabolic drugs was 144.1 +\/- 6.8 cm (n = 105), mothers average height: 162 +\/- 5.3 cm, fathers average height: 172.4 +\/- 6.1 cm, sisters: 164.9 +\/- 5.2 cm (n = 79). The height of women with karyotype 45,X was slightly shorter: 143.1 +\/- 6.9 cm, while the height of the family have remained unchanged. Contrary to all untreated women with Turner syndrome where the height was correlated with the mothers and fathers height (pearson's r = 0.32 and 0.34 respectively), sisters height was correlated mainly with fathers height (pearson's r = 0.47 and 0.34 respectively). In the group with karyotype 45,X patients' height was correlated mainly with mothers height (r = 0.55). In this group sisters height is correlated stronger with fathers' height (r = 0.45) than with mothers' height (r = 0.35). 1. The height of non treated women with Turner syndrome is correlated with both parents height while the height of sisters is correlated mainly with fathers. 2. The height of Turner syndrome women with karyotype 45,X is correlated with their mothers height. ","1106":"Gynecomastia, a benign enlargement of the breast glandular tissue in men. The aim of the study was to evaluate the phenotype of patients with gynecomastia, in particular antropometric assessment, breast ultrasound examination and hormonal testing, as well as to estimate possible causes of gynecomastia in studied population. Two hundred-twenty men were enrolled in the study: 126 patients with gynecomastia and 94 healthy volunteers as a control group. Detailed medical examination, breast ultrasound and hormonal assays for T, E2, LH, FSH, SHBG, S-DHEA, PRL and TSH were performed. Calculation of free testosterone concentration was done. The results of clinical and hormonal evaluation enabled to divide the cases into three groups: patients with idiopathic gynecomastia (58 subjects, 46%), with hypogonadism (34 subjects, 27%) and drug-induced or associated with other disorders gynecomastia (34 subjects, 27%). We found that men with gynecomastia, particularly associated with hypogonadism, had significantly higher BMI compared with control group. Ultrasound examination revealed the positive correlation between breast tissue volume and BMI, duration of gynecomastia and estradiol level, while negative correlation with testosterone level. We demonstrated significant differences in LH, T, SHBG, fT and S-DHEA levels between cases and controls. There were no differences in PRL, FSH and TSH levels among groups. Significant elevation of SHBG concentration in all groups of patients, including idiopathic gynecomastia cases, compared with controls, was remarkable. Clinical evaluation and hormonal profile can help to classify patient with gynecomastia into one of three groups: idiopathic gynecomastia, associated with hypogonadism, and drug-induced or associated with other diseases. Idiopathic gynecomastia - of unknown etiology is diagnosed in almost half of all cases (46%). We showed that apart from well known hormonal disturbances leading to gynecomastia, like hypogonadism or hyperestrogenism, also subtle hormonal alterations, such as sex hormone binding globuline (SHBG) level elevation may contribute to breast enlargement. ","1107":"The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of a thyroid remnants' volume, postsurgical concentration of thyroglobulin and radioiodine dose on the early treatment efficacy of well differentiated thyroid cancer. We retrospectively analyzed 91 patients (76 females, 15 men) with well differentiated thyroid cancer. Histological classification revealed 68.1% (62\/91) papillary thyroid cancers, 25.3% (23\/91) follicular thyroid cancers, and 6.6% (6\/91) oxyphilic thyroid cancers. Among the group, 74 (81.3%) patients reached the remission criteria and the remaining 17 patients (18.7%) showed biochemical and morphological evidence of metastatic disease. The remission was obtained in 100% of patients in stage I of the disease, 68.4% - in stage II, 78.6% - in stage III and 33.3% in stage IV. The total radioiodine dose used in patients with remission, did not differ from the dose used in patients without remission. We did not observe the influence of remnant's volume on treatment efficacy, however larger remants required higher dose of radioiodine to obtain the remission. Patients with remission had lower postsurgical thyroglobulin concentration than patients without remission. (22.2 vs. 103.3 ng\/ml; p = 0.00025). Early treatment results of well differentiated thyroid cancer depend on the clinical stage, and postoperative serum thyroglobulin level measured after endogenous TSH stimulation. Early treatment results are not dependent on age, sex, histological type of thyroid cancer, the dose of radioiodine used in brackets of 60-150 mCi and additional diseases. Total thyroidectomy is equally efficient as near total. ","1108":"The treatment-of-choice for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is a total thyroidectomy with subsequent radioiodine therapy. In order to increase an iodine uptake in thyroid tissue remnants, the L-thyroxine withdrawal is required. It is recommended to achieve TSH levels higher than 25 mU\/ml. As TSH is a known key factor in thyroid cell proliferation regulation, prolonged stimulation of the cells during L-thyroxine withdrawal can be a causative factor for a re-growth. Our aim was to assess the degree of thyroid re-growth in the patients after total thyroidectomy due to DTC and its possible clinical implications. 23 patients operated due to papillary and follicular thyroid cancer were included into the study. Biochemical determinations and ultrasound thyroid imaging were performed (TSH, Tg) during suppressive L-thyroxine therapy as well as 4-5 weeks after the withdrawal. The mean volume of thyroid tissue remnants increased after withdrawal for substantial 30.1%. The difference was extremely significant. L-Thyroxine withdrawal in the patients after total thyroidectomy due to DTC can cause re-growth of the tissue remnants. The phenomenon may be of a clinical significance in the selected cases influencing therapeutic decisions. ","1109":"Evidence collected over the years has demonstrated that cryptorchidism is associated with a defect in spermatogenesis and, as a consequence, with either reduced fertility or infertility. However, the effect of cryptorchidism on Leydig cell function is less clear. The aim of our study therefore was to investigate the regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis and, additionally, intercellular communication in the cryptorchid equine testes. Testes of mature bilaterally cryptorchid horse and healthy stallions were used for this study. The expression of luteinising hormone receptor (LHR), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD), aromatase and connexin43 (Cx43) was detected by means of immunohistochemistry. Testosterone and oestradiol levels were measured in testicular homogenates using appropriate radioimmunoassays. In the testes of both normal and cryptorchid stallions, immunostaining for LHR, 3beta-HSD and aromatase was confined to the Leydig cells. In the cryptorchid horse, the intensity of the staining for LHR and 3beta-HSD was weaker, whereas the staining for aromatase was clearly stronger than that of the normal stallion. Radioimmunological analysis revealed disturbance of the androgen-oestrogen balance in the cryptorchid testes. Additionally, in both the seminiferous tubules and interstitial tissue of the cryptorchid a clear reduction of the Cx43 signal was observed. Decreased expression of LHR and 3beta-HSD and increased expression of aromatase in the cryptorchid testes suggest that hormonal imbalance was caused both by reduced testosterone synthesis and by increased androgen aromatisation. Impaired expression of Cx43 in the seminiferous tubules as well as in the interstitial tissue of the cryptorchid horse indicates that cryptorchidism affects intercellular communication in the testes.

According to distinct prognosis and treatment these tumors are classified as colonic or rectal NET. This paper provides the consensus guidelines for management of patients with these neoplasms recommended by the Polish Neuroendocrine Tumor Network Group. Furthermore the epidemiology and clinical presentation are described.","1111":"Polish recommendations regarding management of patients suffering from neuroendocrine tumors of small intestine and appendix are presented. Small intestine, especially ileum represent most common origin of these tumors. Majority of them are well differentiated and grow slowly. Rarely, they are less differentiated with fast growth and poor prognosis. Symptoms are atypical, diagnosis could be often accidental. In 4-10% of patients typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome are present. Chromogranin A is useful in the laboratory diagnostics, and urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoloacetic acid is helpful for the diagnostics and monitoring of the disease. Histopathological diagnostics was extensively described. Ultrasound, colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy, baloon enteroscopy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance and somatostatin analogs scintigraphy could be used for the visualization. The treatment of choice in the neuroendocrine tumors of small intestine and appendix is radical or palliative surgery, if possible using endoscopy. Pharmacotherapy consists of biotherapy and chemotherapy. The crucial in biotherapy is somatostatin analogs application, possible in symptomatic treatment of hormonally functioning tumors. This is treatment of choice in carcinoid crisis. Interferon alfa could be applied because of the same indications as somatostatin analogs, except for carcinoid crisis. Chemotherapy is less successful in disseminated or locally advanced intestinal neuroendocrine tumors, so radioisotope therapy should be considered in each case of unresectable tumor.","1112":"Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) are rare neoplasms of this organ. The majority of PETs are tumors without hormonal activity. In this publication, we present the diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for the management of these tumors proposed by the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumors. These guidelines refer to biochemical and location diagnostics, including scintygraphy of somatostatin receptors, endoscopic ultrasonography and other anatomical and functional imaging methods. High importance is attached to correct histopathological diagnosis which determines further management of patients with PETs. Antitumor therapy requires multidirectional procedure, and therefore the rules of surgical treatment, biotherapy, chemotherapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are discussed.","1113":"The neuroendocrine tumors of the stomach and duodenum constitute only minority of neoplasms in this localisation. However due to their clinical behaviour and\/or hormonal syndromes they pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

She had a past history of menorrhagia and bleeding after dental procedures and the activity of von Willebrand factor (vWF) was decreased. Because of suggestive clinical features, the workup for hypothyroidism was performed and the patient was found to have severe hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto thyroiditis. After the institution of replacement therapy with levothyroxine, von Willebrand factor activity returned to normal range and symptoms of von Willebrand disease disappeared. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) due to hypothyroidism was made. The development of myasthenia led to the final diagnosis of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 (APS) with myasthenia gravis and vitiligo.","1116":"Both the \"hook\" effect and macroprolactinaemia, are the main reasons behind the discrepancy of serum prolactin level results in various laboratories.

We can consider what kind of connection with ability to cope with difficulties. One situation which is very stressful for an individual is an illness, particularly a chronic one. The aim of the paper was to define the connection between dispositional optimism and acceptance of illness among the group with Graves-Basedow disease. This is autoimmunizational illness and diseases of this kind are particularly sensitive to the influence of psychological factors, as there are many connections between the immune system and the human psyche. The study group consisted of 59 individuals with Graves-Basedow disease, 50 women and 9 men and 55 of healthy ones, 49 women and 6 men according to age, sex and a level of education. The patients filled out three psychological questionnaires: The Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), The Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS) and The Personal Questionnaire. of the study in question indicate a lack of differences between individuals with Graves-Basedow disease and healthy ones concerning the level of dispositional optimism. There no differences in the level of dispositional optimism as regards of criterion of health: by the levels of hormones TSH, fT3 and fT4, complications and a time of duration of disease. Instead, if they suffer additionally from others diseases, they have a lower level of dispositional optimism. There exist a connection between intensification of level of dispositional optimism and acceptance of illness among testing group. The dispositional optimism as a supply of individual helps her or his in adaptation to difficulty situation, which is a chronic disease. It is a reason way it is worth to help of patients to grow it stronger. ","1118":"Apoptosis can influence both adipose tissue mass and its distribution. The suprafamily of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptors stimulate apoptosis. The aim of the study was to assess serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF soluble receptors (sTNFRs) and FAS in obese subjects and to examine the changes in these parameters after weight loss. The study group consisted of 23 obese women without additional disease aged 36.6 +\/- 10.9 years. These were examined before and after three-month weight reduction treatment consisting of a diet of 1000 kcal\/day and physical exercise. The control group comprised 17 lean healthy women aged 40.3 +\/- 5.5 years. Blood samples were taken in the morning after an overnight fast. Serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, sTNFRs and FAS were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum concentrations of insulin were measured by RIA. Serum concentrations of glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were measured by an enzymatic procedure. The mean weight loss over the three-month treatment was 11.4 +\/- 3.1 kg. Following weight loss, serum TNF-alpha concentrations decreased significantly (7.3 +\/- 3.0 vs. 5.4 +\/- 1.6 pg\/ml; p &lt; 0.005) and concentrations of sTNFRs increased significantly (1222.6 +\/- 211.8 vs. 1325.6 +\/- 261.6 pg\/ml; p &lt; 0.05 and 1881.5 +\/- 337.2 vs. 2057.4 +\/- 358.7 pg\/ml; p &lt; 0.05 respectively). However, no changes in serum concentrations of FAS were observed after weight loss. We observed increased serum concentrations of TNF-alpha but not of FAS in obese women. The concentrations of TNF decreased and those of sTNFRs increased after weight loss. However, the weight reduction therapy did not change serum concentrations of FAS. ","1119":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of modest weight reduction on serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF soluble receptors (sTNFRs) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The study group consisted of 15 obese women with PCOS (mean age 28.5 +\/- 7.7 years). Serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, sTNFRs and IL-6, insulin, FSH, LH, DHEAS, androstendione, total and free testosterone, cortisol, 17OH-progesterone, oestradiol and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were measured before treatment and after 10% weight loss. All patients were advised to follow a 1000-1200 kcal diet with a limited intake of simple carbohydrate and animal fats and to exercise regularly (30 min, 3 times a week). Body composition was measured by bioimpedance. Serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, sTNFRs and IL-6 were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Plasma insulin, FSH, LH, DHEAS, androstendione, total and free testosterone, cortisol, 17OH-progesterone, oestradiol and SHBG were measured by a commercial RIA. Blood glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were measured by an enzymatic procedure. We observed no differences in serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, sTNFRs or IL-6 after treatment. It seems that more than a modest weight reduction is necessary to obtain a decrease in serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and an improvement in ovarian function in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome. ","1120":"The aim of this study was to examine usefulness of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in clinical evaluation of different glucose metabolism disturbances in subjects with at least one risk factor of type 2 diabetes. We compared the effectiveness of non-pharmacological and pharmacological prevention and treatment regiments on metabolic control in these individuals. The study involved 130 patients, with the following characteristics: age between 18 to 76 years, mean body mass index (BMI) - 31.82 +\/- 7.24 kg\/m(2), and presence of at least one of the risk factor of type 2 diabetes. Glucose metabolism disturbances were diagnosed according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Non-pharmacological regiments were applied for 3 months for patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes. Patients, whose still met criteria for type 2 diabetes during OGTT after non-pharmacological treatment were scheduled for pharmacological interventions. These patients were assigned at random to two groups, that were treated with either metformin or acarbose. The measurements of total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol, trigliceryde (TG), glucose, HbA(1c) and\/or OGGT were performed during each visit. We also assessed risk factors for type 2 diabetes in these subjects. The prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance in subjects with at least one of the risk factor of diabetes type 2 was near 40%. OGTT in these subjects increased the possibility of diagnosis diabetes type 2 and IGT. Hypertension (81%), hypercholesterolemia (71.4%), hypertriglicerydemia (71.4%) and obesity (66.7%) were the most frequent risk factors observed. There were no differences in biochemical measurements between these groups of patients. Individuals with at least one risk factor of type 2 diabetes should have screening test to diagnose glucose intolerance. Both non-pharmacological and pharmacological intervention was effective in normalization of glucose OGTT in patients with diabetes type 2 and IGT in newly diagnosed with disease patients. ","1121":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the blood concentration of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in patients at various stages of retinopathy. We hypothesised that the high level of HGF found in diabetic patients may be an important marker of retinopathy progression and that HGF level may be an index of the risk of proliferative retinopathy. The participants in the study were 76 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Of these, 35 patients were without retinopathy and formed Group 1. Of the remaining 41 patients with retinopathy, 20 patients had non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and formed Group 2, while 21 patients had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and formed Group 3. We evaluated the concentration of HGF In the peripheral blood by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mean serum concentrations of HGF in the control group were significantly lower than in the type 1 diabetic patients. We found a significant increase in HGF serum concentrations in diabetic patients with PDR compared with the control group. Mean serum HGF concentrations were significantly higher in diabetic subjects with PDR than in diabetic patients without retinopathy. HGF concentration is increased in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus with proliferative retinopathy, and concentrations increase with the progression of retinopathy, suggesting that HGF plays a role in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. ","1122":"Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a term used to define a clinical condition in which a reduced serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level is accompanied by thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine levels within the reference ranges. It is a common condition with the prevalence in the general population estimated on 0.6-16%. Subclinical hypethyroidism may progress to overt hyperthyroidism and is associated with the risk of the development of cardiovascular complications (especially atrial fibrillation), osteoporosis and dementia. Indications for the management of subclinical hyperthyroidism still remain controversial. The aim of this paper is to familiarise the reader with the present state of knowledge on the prevalence, etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, potential complications, prognosis and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.","1123":"Arteriovenous carotid-cavernous fistula is an abnormal connection between the dural branches of carotid artery or vertebral artery and the dural sinuses. Its clinical manifestations can resemble the crucial signs of thyroid orbitopathy, an inflammatory disorder of the orbit associated with Graves' disease. Therefore, differential diagnosis of thyroid orbitopathy and the congestion of the orbit seen in arteriovenous fistula is often clinically and radiologically confused. This is the case report of the simultaneous occurrence of dural arteriovenous fistula in 59 years old woman. The first manifestation was unilateral exophthalmia. After Computer Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging were performed, the preliminary diagnosis of thyroid orbitopathy was established. The response of eye disorder to corticosteroid treatment resulted in evident deterioration. This prompted a reconsideration of the diagnosis and a new evaluation of the patient with sensitive techniques, leading to the final diagnosis of arteriovenous fistula.","1124":"Insulinotropic gut-derived hormones (incretins) play a significant role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in healthy subjects and are responsible for 50-70% of insulin response to a meal. The main mediators of the incretin effect are glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). However, in patients with type 2 diabetes the effect of incretins action is to a large extent impaired, which seems to explain disturbed secretional activity of beta cells in pancreatic islets. Detailed analysis of incretin defect proved that GIP secretion remains within physiological limits, whereas GLP-1 secretion is significantly decreased. Nevertheless, GLP-1 insulinotropic effect is preserved and GIP effect is significantly impaired. In consequence, substitutional GLP-1 administration aiming at the reduction of its deficiency, seems to be logical therapeutic management, because despite a physiologically retained quantity response from GIP, resistance to this peptide is frequently found. Therefore, particularly promising are the results of clinical studies with the use of GLP-1 analogues , GLP-1 receptors activation, as well as the inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP IV), the enzyme responsible for incretin proteolysis, which restores the proper function of the intestinal-pancreatic axis in subjects with type 2 diabetes and creates new possibilities of a glycaemia reducing therapy and improvement in quality of life in this group of patients.","1125":"The sodium iodide symporter, called also the NIS protein is responsible for iodine trapping to the cell what is significant for the thyroid function.

Existing studies on the sodium iodide symporter include among others: indicating NIS protein expression in the thyroid diseases and extrathyroidal tissues, studying of the NIS antygenicity in the autoimmune diseases of thyroid, finding the molecular aspects of the difference in the NIS protein activity. The sodium iodide symporter is a base of radioiodine therapy of, as for now, thyroid diseases only. Showing NIS protein expression in other cancerous tissues provide a new therapeutic strategy for a variety of human cancers. Additionally, latest explorations indicate at an innovative destination of the studies concerning the sodium iodide symporter that is the gene therapy with the use of gene NIS transfer.","1126":"Epidemiologic data show significantly higher frequency of thromboembolic incidents in obesity than in normal weight persons. Disorders of haemostasis seem to play a crucial role in their development. In the literature there are only few papers assessing coagulation and fibrynolitic parameters in obese subjects. Assessment of protein C (PC), antithrombin (AT) and alpha2 antiplasmin (alpha2AP) activity and thrombomodulin (TM) concentration in the blood plasma of obese person (BMI &gt; 30 kg\/m(2)). The study involved 32 patients (22 women and 10 men, mean age 39.7 +\/- 15.3 years) and 20 healthy volunteers matched correctly according to sex and age who constituted a control group. In the examined subjects activity of PC, AT, alpha2 AP were assessed by means of the colorimetric methods and TM concentration in the blood plasma using ELISA method. No statistically significant differences in activities of PC, AT, alpha2 AP and TM concentrations between the patients and the control group were found. However the tendency to higher activities of PC and concentrations of TM were noticed in the obese patients. Assessing tested parameters according to sex, statistically significant differences were found in AT activity between the male patients and healthy men. Statistically lower values, but still in the normal range, were found in the obese men. Comparing the groups of women, significantly lower concentrations of TM were found in the obese ones. It seems that changed values of PC, AT, alpha2 AP activities are not responsible for increased risk of thromboembolic events in obese persons. Increased TM concentration in obese, may indirectly indicate endothelium damage. ","1127":"The metabolic syndrome characterized by central obesity, insulin and lipid dysregulation, and hypertension, is a precursor state for atherosclerotic process and, in consequence, cardiovascular disease. Decline of both testicular and adrenal function with aging causes a decrease in androgen concentration in men. It has been postulated that low levels of total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) are associated with unfavorable levels of several strong cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as lipids and blood pleasure, which are components of the metabolic syndrome, and insulin levels. Both testosterone and DHEA-S deficiency are risk factors of obesity and insulin resistance, but it is not clear, whether this possible influence is independent. The aim of this study was to determined whether lower androgens (testosterone and DHEA-S) levels are associated with the development of metabolic syndrome in non-obese elderly men as well as analysis, whether these sex hormones influents on measured parameters separately. Together 85 men age from 60 to 70 years (mean 66.3 +\/- 1.5 years; mean +\/- SEM) were analyzed. Testosterone levels &lt; 4 ng\/ml or DHEA levels &lt; 2000 ng\/ml and BMI &lt; 30 kg\/m(2) were including criteria. Patients were divided into three groups: 52 with testosterone deficiency (L-T), 32 with DHEA deficiency (L-DHEA-S) and 67 with deficiency of both sex hormones (L-T\/DHEA-S). The influence of sex hormones deficiency in these groups on blood pressure, lipids, visceral obesity and fasting glucose were measured (according to metabolic syndrome definition NCEP III\/IDF). Testosterone levels in L-T, L-DHEA and L-T\/DHEA-S groups were respectively 3.19 +\/- 0.23 ng\/ml, 4.89 +\/- 0.45 ng\/ml and 3.25 +\/- 0.34 g\/ml (p &lt; 0.002). While DHEA-S levels were respectively 2498 +\/- 98 ng\/ml, 1435 +\/- 1010 ng\/ml and 1501 +\/- +\/- 89 ng\/ml). BMI values do not differ between groups. Waist circumference was significantly higher in L-T\/DHEA-S group than in L-T i L-DHEA-S groups (respectively: 99.9 +\/- 6,1 cm, 97.1 +\/- 7.1 cm i 96.2 +\/- 6.4 cm; mean +\/- SD, p &lt; 0.05 vs. L-T and L-DHEA-S groups). Mean triglycerides concentration in L-T\/DHEA-S group was significantly higher than in L-T and L-DHEA-S groups (respectively: 188.2 +\/- 13.3 mg\/dl, 161.7 +\/- 14.7 mg\/dl and 152.2 +\/- 12.8 mg\/dl (mean +\/- SD; p &lt; 0.02 vs. L-T and L-DHEA-S groups). Analysis of prevalence of risk factors showed, that in L-T\/DHEA-S group they were more frequent than in other groups. The most significant percentage difference was observed for triglycerides: concentration &gt; or = 150 mg\/dl was measured in 31% men in L-T group, 28% men in L-DHEA-S group and 42% men in L-T\/DHEA-S group. According metabolic syndrome definition NCEP III\/IDF prevalence of this syndrome was: 71% patients in L-T\/DHEA-S group, 67% patients in L-T group and 64% patients in L-DHEA-S group. The DHEA-S and testosterone deficiency was a significant and independent risk factor of the metabolic syndrome in non-obese elderly men. It seems, that triglycerides concentration and waist circumference are more sensitive then others parameters to reflect the influence of sex hormones deficiency on risk of the metabolic syndrome in elderly men. ","1128":"Apoptosis plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD). The prevalence of AITD increases with age. Purpose to compare soluble Fas, FasL and Bcl-2 in Graves disease (GD) and Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) in relation to the age of the studied patients. 3 groups of subjects: 1\/25 patients with GD in euthyreosis on methimazol 2\/27 patients with ChH in euthyreosis on levothyroxine. 3\/12 healthy volunteers age and sex-matched to group 1-2. The serum levels of Fas, FasL and Bcl-2 were determined by the ELISA kit. We found positive correlations between sFas and age in GD patients (r = 0.35; p &lt; 0.05). In GD patients we found a negative correlation between sFasL and age in all studied patients with AITD (r = -0.34; p &lt; 0.01). We also found a negative correlation between sBcl-2 and age in HT patients (r = -0.42; p &lt; 0.05). Fas\/FasL and Bcl-2 signaling pathways seem to be age-related and may explain, at least in part, milder course of Graves disease in elderly patients and increased prevalence of Hashimoto disease in this group of subjects. ","1129":"The soluble forms of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) have been found to be increased in the blood of patients with Graves disease. The aim of this study is evaluation of the serum concentrations of soluble forms of adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in patients with thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO) before and after methylprednisolone treatment. The study was performed in 40 Graves disease, hyperthyroid and euthyroid patients with a clinically active form of TAO. Serum concentrations of sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 in TAO patients were determined by enzymelinked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) before and after intensive pulse methylprednisolone treatment. We did not find any significant changes in the studied parameters between TAO patients with hyperthyroidism and those with euthyroidism. The serum concentrations of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were significantly increased in patients with TAO before methylprednisolone therapy when compared with the control group. After treatment serum concentrations of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 decreased significantly but were still significantly higher than for the control group. From the results obtained we can conclude that Graves orbitopathy itself but not thyroid function is probably responsible for the elevated level of the adhesion molecules studied. ","1130":"Angiogenesis has been shown to be necessary for the development and progression of solid tumours. VEGF is one of the crucial pro-angiogenic cytokines produced by the cells of many of the tumours examined, including various types of anterior pituitary adenomas. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is known to regulate the expression of VEGF in a variety of tissues both in the physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, an association of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with oestrogen-induced vascular changes during the development of rat pituitary PRL-secreting adenoma has already been demonstrated. The aim of the study was to determine the in vitro effects of angiotensin peptides (Ang II, Ang III and Ang IV) on the secretion of VEGF in two anterior pituitary adenoma cell cultures: the culture of the rat pituitary lactosomatotrope tumour cell line (GH3) and the primary culture of rat PRL-secreting tumour induced by diethylstilbestrol (DES). GH3 and prolactinoma cells were cultured in an F10 and an F-12 medium respectively and then placed into 24 multiwell plates (10(5) of GH3 cells\/well and 10(6) of rat prolactinoma cells\/well). After 12 hours of preincubation the cells underwent 24-hour treatment with Ang II, Ang III or Ang IV at final concentrations of 10(-12), 10(-10), 10(-8) or 10(-6)M and, in the case of the GH3 cells, combined treatment with Ang II (10(-10)M) and specific AT1 or AT2 receptor antagonist (losartan or PD123319 respectively at a concentration of 10(-8) or 10(-7) M). The concentration of VEGF in the supernatant collected was determined using specific ELISA assay kits. Statistical evaluation was performed using Student's test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences were considered significant if p &lt; 0.05. The incubation of both GH3 cells and rat adenoma cells with Ang II, Ang III or Ang IV at concentrations of 10(-12) -10(-8)M resulted in a significant increase in VEGF concentration in the culture medium. Exposure of GH3 cells to Ang III or Ang IV at concentrations of 10(-6)M led to a significant inhibition of cytokine release, and Pearson's correlation curve showed a tendency for Ang II at concentrations of more than 10(-6)M to inhibit VEGF secretion in primary prolactinoma cell culture. The stimulatory influence of Ang II on VEGF secretion in GH3 cell culture was negated by losartan or by PD123319 in both concentrations tested. Ang II, Ang III and Ang IV affect the secretion of VEGF in cultures of the rat lactosomatotrope GH3 cell line and primary rat prolactinoma cells. Both AT1 and AT2 receptors mediate the stimulatory action of Ang II on the cytokine release in GH3 cell culture. The mechanism of the observed anti-angiogenic effects of angiotensin peptides remains unexplained. ","1131":"Central precocious puberty, defined as the onset of puberty before the age 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys, results from a premature activation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the hypothalamus. This condition is characterised by early pubertal changes, acceleration of growth velocity, and rapid bone maturation that often result in reduced adult height. It may be either idiopathic or associated with hypothalamic hamartoma, brain neoplasms, numerous non-cancerous disorders of the central nervous system and treatment of peripheral precocious puberty. The goal of the initial assessment of children is to exclude the presence of all these organic disorders. The diagnosis should include detailed anamnesis and clinical examination, measurement of pituitary and sex hormones, assessment of bone age, and imaging of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, abdomen, pelvis and gonads. The treatment of choice are gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In this paper, we review the current views on the etiopathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of central precocious puberty.","1132":"The authors describe a case of an adult woman with congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency. The patient presented not only typical features of this disease such as virilization and hypokaliemic hypertension but also rare pathologies, such as ectopic adrenal tissues, salt loss during infancy, and functional adrenomedullary hyperactivity. In spite of the severe disease and delays in its diagnosis and adequate treatment, significant improvement in appearance and normalization of blood pressure as well as the birth of a healthy child were achieved. The paper also discusses current opinions concerning the pathogenesis and treatment in CAH with 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency as well as difficulties in diagnostic and therapeutic management.","1133":"Coexistence of Graves-Basedow disease with orbitopathy and thyroid cancer is believed to be a rare event. A 39-year-old man with clinical features of hyperthyroidism associated with exophthalmos and goitre presented to out patient clinic. Thyroid function tests showed hyperthyroidism with elevated thyroid-stimulating antibodies. Graves-Basedow disease was diagnosed. Ultrasound revealed diffuse thyroid enlargement with hypoechoic pattern and hypoechoic lesions with regular edges of 1.0 cm diameter at the left and right lobe. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was negative. Due to the patient's nodular goitre and mild orbitopathy, after some further 3 months of anti-thyroid medication, near total thyroidectomy was performed. Histologically, papillary microcarcinoma was found. Following surgery, the patient was referred to our Department of Endocrinology, L-thyroxine suppression treatment was commenced. Approximately 8 weeks post surgery, the patient reported with eye discomfort, soft tissue oedema and double vision. On CT thickening of the left superior rectus muscle was found. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy was applied (4 weeks, 2 grams per week). Glucocorticoid therapy resulted in significant improvement of soft tissue inflammation and of diplopia. The patient was qualified for 131I radioiodine complementary therapy (3657 MBq) and orbital irradiation. While some authors suggest that radioiodine therapy may be associated with worsening of pre-existing orbitopathy, so far we have not observed it in our patient, perhaps due to thyroid removal as a source of autoreactive T lymphocytes and the protective effect of applied glucocorticoids.","1134":"Intersexual disorders, the causes of which are frequently difficult to diagnose, usually result from the disruption of sex determination and gonadal development or from impairment in function of endocrine organs such as gonads and adrenal glands. Thus consideration of etiopatogenesis of intersexuality should be based on an analysis of the genetic control of sex determination, gonadal differentiation and first of all molecular regulation of steroidogenic cell differentiation and functioning. These processes take place in the fetal gonads, which explains the small amount of data concerning the development of human gonads. However, numerous investigations of gene expression in murine gonads have revealed a complicated machinery involved in sex determination and gonadal differentiation. Moreover, data obtained from mice have led to a better understanding of the molecular background of sex determination and gonad differentiation in humans. Nevertheless, the interpretation of mouse gene knock-outs does not always reflect mutations of their homologues in man. This article compares data in humans and mice, revealing the existence of many sex-determining genes in both, which should be taken into consideration during the diagnosis of intersexual disorders. Mutations of some genes controlling murine gonad development have not been described in humans so far. This indicates the necessity of conducting extensive genetic analysis of individuals with intersexual disorders.","1135":"Addison disease (primary insufficience of adrenal cortex) characterized by clinical signs and symptoms associated with deficiency of adrenal hormones. The most frequent etiopathogenesis of Addison disease is related with autoimmunization. In sera of Addison patients are detectable autoantibodies against another endocrine glands. The aim of the study was evaluation of pituitary autoantibodies in Addison disease patients using immunoblotting methods. Studies were performed in 19 Addison disease patients, 16 women (age range: 28-63 yrs, median: 43.5 +\/- 8.9) and 3 men (age range: 18-45 yrs, median: 30.6 +\/- 9.8). All patients presented signs and symptoms typical of primary insufficiency of adrenal cortex. Sera of control subjects were obtained from 10 healthy blood donors, 7 women, 3 men (age range 21-45 yrs, median: 30.6 +\/- 7.1). Incidence of pituitary autoantibodies was assessed by polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and western-blotting. Pituitary microsomes were obtained from human pituitary tissues by ultracentrifugation and solubilisation in 1% desoxycholic acid. In 14 sera from 19 we detected autoantibodies against pituitary microsomal antigen 67 kDa, 12 sera were recting with 60 kDa and 10 sera with 55 kDa. It is important to note that 10 sera were reacting with 67 and 55 kDa, and 9 sera with 55, 60 and 67 kDa. In sera of Addison disease patients autoantibodies against pituitary microsomal antigens can be frequently detected. The most frequent are antibodies against 55, 60 and 67 kDa antigens.

There are no data about the role of CD36 in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in women with visceral obesity. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of visceral obesity on CD36 expression on peripheral blood monocytes. CD36 expression was evaluated (by flow cytometry) in study population consisted of 30 women aged 25-45 years (mean 34.03 +\/- 11.14) with visceral obesity. Control group consisted of 15 nonobese women aged 25-45 years (mean 31.93 +\/- 2.43). Physical examination was performed with body mass, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, waist to hip ratio evaluation. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed with estimation of glucose and insulin concentrations. Body mass, BMI, WHR, waist and hip circumferences were significantly higher in obese than in nonobese women. Glucose and insulin concentrations in 0', 30' 60' of OGTT as well as HOMA and FIRI values were significantly higher in obese than in nonobese women. Expression of CD36 on monocytes was significantly lower in obese women (mean 62.99 +\/- 18.07) than in controls (mean 82.5 +\/- 22.93). There were not significant correlations between CD36 expression and BMI, WHR and IR indexes.

There are suggestion, that there are association between polymorphism androgen receptor gene and the occurrence typical features of metabolic syndrome in men. The metabolic syndrome is more frequent with aging. We knows, that polymorphism androgen receptor gene is associated with risk of prostate cancer and with occurrence Kennnedy's syndrome. However the association of this polymorphism for occurrence of hypertension, obesity and lipid and glucose concentration disturbance is not examined. The original study population consisted 268 randomly selected wroclaw population men aged 45-65. The physician examination include mensuration of blood pressure and antropometrical analysis. The men were coming on an empty stomach between 8.00 and 10.00 am for blood taken. The blood were taken for biochemical measurements and for genetic analysis CAG repeat in androgen receptor gene. There is statistical significant differences between number of CAG repeat in men with normal and higher concentration of cholesterol LDL. There were no significant differences between number of CAG repeat in men in dependent of value of blood pressure and concentration of insulin, glucose, cholesterol HDL, total cholesterol and triglicerides. The investigation results are not unambiguous with regard to influence of polymorphism androgen receptor gene for occurrence of metabolic syndrome in men. We found only association between number of CAG repeat an androgen receptor gene and concentration of cholesterol LDL (which it is as we knows atherogenic factor). ","1138":"Current thyrotropin (TSH) reference range established by sensitive assays is from 0.2-0.4 mj.m.\/l to 4.0-4.5 mj.m.\/l. Serum TSH reference range was performed using specimens from healthy volunteers without history of thyroid disease but the values distribution is not concordant with Gaussian curve and is skewed toward upper values. It is claimed that upper reference limit for TSH should be declined because of possible incorporation of individuals with unrecognized chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis into initial study. American National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry recommends to examine only euthyroid healthy volunteers without personal or family history of thyroid dysfunction, visible or palpable goiter, with no detectable thyroid antibodies measured by sensitive immunoassays and without any medication except estrogen. Many authors observed that even in such rigorously selected population the upper limit of TSH does not decrease significantly. The other possible factors which may influence TSH values are ethnic features, age, iodine intake, time of phlebotomy or assay sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore there are no epidemiological data showing adverse consequences of serum TSH between 3.0 mj.m.\/l and 5.0 mj.m.\/l. And because of it current upper limit for TSH should remain unchanged. However one must realize that many people with TSH values between 3.0 mj.m.\/l and 5.0 mj.m.\/l have unrecognized chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and should be followed because of possible future hypothyroidism. The special care is needed for pregnant women or those planning to be pregnant.","1139":"A case of 19-year-old male with idiopathic diabetes insipidus diagnosed 9 years ago. 1.5 years from the onset of the disease vision disturbances, neurologic deficiencies and symptoms of hypopituitarism showed up.

For 7 years from the end of treatment patient has not declared any complains except for vision disturbances and hypopituitarism has been substituted successfully. The case puts on the necessity of a strict endocrinologic and radiologic follow-up in patients with idiopathic diabetes insipidus due to the possibility of existing potentially curable disease ie. intracranial tumor.","1140":"Testosterone is the main male sex hormone which determination is useful for assessment of androgen status. It seems that serum levels of testosterone, when assayed by commonly used methods, do not correlate with clinical parameters. One of the causes may be that these assays are suitable for determination of total testosterone, but not for measurement of biologically active forms of this hormone. The aim of this review is to present usefulness of testosterone measurement and its bioactive forms determination as well as factors influencing on their levels.","1141":"The process of angiogenesis in a heart muscle is a way of providing the ischaemic myocardium with oxygen and nutritive ingredients. This natural process called therapeutic angiogenesis has been tried in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease mainly. It has been seen as a chance of an effective beneficial therapy particularly in these patients for whom pharmacological treatment is not sufficient and who are disqualified for operative methods such as the percutaneous coronary angioplasty, or coronary bypass transplantation. The goal of therapeutic angiogenesis is to stimulate the growth of new capillaries in a heart and, as a result, to improve the perfusion and function of a heart muscle. The positive impact of the angiogenesis in a heart muscle is impeded in patients using corticosteroids in treatment for other illnesses. Corticosteroids inhibit the angiogenesis process on a cellular and tissue level. They decrease gene expression for VEGF, iNOS, inhibit the activity of transcriptive factors for AP-1 and NF(k)B. Corticosteroids cause the degradation of a pericellular matrix, inhibit the migration of macrophages and inhibit the synthesis of NO and interleukin. These activities of corticosteroids decrease the number of new vessels in a ischaemic myocardium and, consequently, worsen vascularization and progressive hypoxia.","1142":"The poor efficacy of reference chemotherapy (fluorouracil -FU) in colon cancer has resulted in a constant search for agents which could augment the action of FU. Epidemiological data, such as the decreased risk of colorectal cancer among menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy, indicate the role of oestrogen in the pathogenesis of this disease. The differences between normal and neoplastic colon cells in the expression of oestrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) could confirm this association. However, the direct influence of oestrogen or tamoxifen (SERM, selective oestrogen receptor modulator) on colon cancer growth has rarely been studied. The aim of the present study was to examine the direct effects of various concentrations of oestradiol and tamoxifen (10(-4) to 10(-12) M), applied alone or together with FU, on the growth of murine Colon 38 cancer in vitro as assessed by three colorimetric methods: Mosmann's method, incorporation of BrdU into cell nuclei and the TUNEL method. At high concentrations oestradiol and tamoxifen decreased the cancer growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner (the Mosmann and BrdU methods) and at some concentrations augmented the cytotoxic action of FU (Mosmann's method). Tamoxifen exerted a very early and potent inhibitory effect, inducing even total cancer growth inhibition at the concentration of 10(-4) M (the Mosmann and BrdU methods). All the substances studied at different concentrations and at different incubation time points increased the apoptosis of tumour cells (the TUNEL method). The results indicate that oestradiol and tamoxifen inhibit Colon 38 cancer growth and increase the cytotoxic effect of FU, which confirms the role of sex steroids in colon carcinogenesis and even suggests new therapeutic schemes.","1143":"The aim of the present study was to examine the response of plasma orexin and ghrelin to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in obese women without additional disease. The study group comprised 15 obese women aged 30.4+\/-9.7 years of mean BMI 34.7+\/-3.8 kg\/m(2). The measurements were performed after an overnight fast and 30, 60 and 120 minutes after the oral administration of 75 grams of glucose. Serum concentrations of ghrelin and orexin A were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Serum concentrations of insulin were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Plasma glucose was determined by an enzymatic procedure. Body composition was determined by impedance analysis using Bodystat. We observed no significant differences between serum concentrations of ghrelin and orexin during OGTT. No correlations were found between serum ghrelin and orexin concentrations and serum insulin and glucose concentrations in any of the measurements. Oral glucose administration did not change serum concentrations of ghrelin and orexin A in obese women without additional disease. ","1144":"Therapeutic approach to incidentaloma, in spite of existing algorithms, is not always obvious due to diagnostic difficulties. The aim of the study was to assess the validity of the initial diagnoses of incidentaloma which determined the qualification for the operation. 125 patients hospitalised in the Endocrinology Dept. of the Medical University of Bialystok in the years 2003-2005 and in the Endocrinology dept. of Voivodeship Hospital of Bialystok. The patients were clinically and hormonally examined (metanephrines in daily urine collection, daily cortisol rhythm, short dexamethasone test, aldosterone, and renin plasma activity, Na, K levels in the serum) as well as computer tomography of the adrenal glands were performed. 42 patients were qualified for adrenalectomy. Adenoma was confirmed in 25 patients (in 7 subclinical Cushing syndrome was diagnosed, in 2 Conn disease, in 16 inactive changes), phaeochromocytoma in 6 patients, cysts in 3, lipoma in 2, carcinoma in one, in 4 patients metastases (in 2 of kidney carcinoma, in 1 of malignant melanoma and in 1 of planocellular carcinoma) and in one oncocytoma. Metanephrines urine measurements showed 33% of false positive results. Qualification for adrenalectomy requires an assessment of tumor's enlargement, its tissue density, morphology and growth dynamics. To reduce the percentage of false positive results of metanephrine measurement there is to eliminate an influence of some drugs, victuals, beverages and nicotine and eventually to carry out additional tests. The decision as to proceeding with adrenal incidentaloma should be individualized based on clinical symptoms, hormonal tests and tumor morphology. ","1145":"Pegvisomant, growth hormone (GH) antagonist is a new perspective in the treatment of acromegaly. Pegvisomant interferes with GH action by competitive binding to receptor and blocking signal transduction. We present first experiences with treatment acromegaly with pegvisomant in Poland. Aim of the study was to assess pegvisomant efficacy in treatment patients with persistent acromegaly after transspheno-ideal surgery and unsatisfactory disease control with somatostatin analogue octreotide (OCTR). Material consisted of 10 patients (6 M, 4 F) aged 24-48 with active acromegaly, after neurosurgery, in which OCTR was ineffective in disease control. Patients with glucose metabolism disturbances were assigned to group receiving PEG. Controls were matched for age, sex, disease history, GH and IGF-1 levels. Patients received pegvisomant throughout 12 weeks, then combined therapy with PEG and OCTR-LAR was started for 8 weeks and then OCTR-LAR alone was given for next 8 weeks. Controls were medicated with OCTR-LAR 30 mg each 4 weeks during study. Clinical symptoms and IGF-1 level, fasting glucose and HbA(1c) was measured to assess treatment efficacy. Pegvisomant reduced IGF-1 after first week of therapy from 1270+\/-229 to 759+\/-223 (40%, p&lt;0.04). Prolonged therapy led to further IGF-1 decrease. After 12 weeks of treatment IGF-1 was significantly lower in comparison to initial as well as to controls (604 mg\/l vs. 1270 and 1330, respectively, p&lt;0.02). Combined therapy with PEG and OCTR-LAR was not superior to PEG alone. During treatment with pegvisomant improvement of glucose metabolism was seen, as well as decrease in insulin doses required. No adverse events was recorded. Pegvisomant--GH receptor antagonist--effectively lowers IGF-1 concentration and improves disease control in patients with acromegaly after unsuccessful surgery and with octreotide unresponsiveness. Significantly improves glucose metabolism. Pegvisomant is indicated in patients with active acromegaly after standard treatment failure, especially in cases of coexistent diabetes mellitus.

An accurate estimation of the thyroid volume, among other factors, is necessary to calculate the suitable radioactive iodine dose, which determines the success of the therapy. The aim of the study was to estimate the volume of the goiter by means of US and (131)I-SPECT. A group of 80 patients with a thyroid disorder in their past medical history was examined. Patients were divided into two groups. The group A contained 50 patients (39 females, 11 males) with a goiter, where the volume of the thyroid was evaluated with the use of US and (131)I-SPECT. The group B contained 30 patients (21 females, 9 males) with a normal volume of the thyroid gland shown by US and (131)I-SPECT. US of the thyroid gland was made by means of an ALOKA SSD 500 device, with the linear head 7.5 MHz frequency. (131)I-SPECT was made by means of a one head gammacamera Diacam with a high energy collimator. In the group A, the average volume of the goiter was 44.55 ml in US and 49.67 ml in SPECT (p&lt;0.001). In control group B the average volumes of the thyroid gland were respectively 13.83 ml vs. 16.19 ml (p&lt;0.001).

","1147":"For many years much attention has been focused on an interaction between the breast disease and the thyroid gland function in the literature. In those studies the question whether disease changes in the thyroid gland can induces the breast disease was addressed. On the other hand there are a few works concerning the inverted question whether the breast cancer therapy, in particular after mastectomy and chemotherapy, can disturb the thyroid gland function. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of the mastectomy and chemotherapy on the thyroid gland function in women after breast cancer therapy. 173 patients aged 30-80 (average 56) were included in this study. The studied group comprised 97 women after breast cancer therapy (average age 60). The control group consisted of 76 patients (average age 55). 75 patients after mastectomy of the studied group were additionally treated with chemotherapy, but in 22 women chemotherapy was not applied. The following methods were used to carry out the research: the USG method was applied to evaluate thyroid morphological condition in women after mastectomy and chemotherapy; the color Doppler technique was used for dynamic presentation and fine- needle aspiration biopsy: examination of the thyroid functional state by measuring the TSH, fT(3), fT(4) hormone concentration and the level of antithyroid antibodies. An average concentration of antithyroid antibodies: anti-TPO and anti-Tg was found significantly higher in the studied group of women after chemotherapy, comparing with the control group. The level of fT(3) hormone concentration was comparable in all investigated groups. Nevertheless, the average concentration of TSH was found higher in women after mastectomy and chemotherapy and as a consequence leading to hypothyroidism. Taking into consideration the high level of the concentration of antithyroid antibodies: (anti-TPO and anti- Tg), which lead to destruction of the thyroid gland tissue, the thyroid gland function of the women after mastectomy and chemotherapy should be monitored morphologically as well as functionally. ","1148":"Patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma have to undergo radical surgical treatment, which includes total thyreoidectomy, radioiodine therapy and a life-time suppressive therapy with L-thyroxine. The aim of this study was a prospective evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy during L suppressive-thyroxine treatment in patients treated for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The examined group comprised 50 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, treated by total thyroidectomy and 131I therapy. Echocardiographic measurements were needed for estimation of left ventricular mass and its index, according to recommendations of American Echocardiography Society. During two-years long suppressive therapy we observed a significant rise in left ventricular mass. In woman group left ventricular mass was increased from 168+\/-39 g to 204+\/-45 g (p&lt;0.001) and in men from 205+\/-60 to 320+\/-21 g. Likewise, left ventricular mass index was increased in women group from 96+\/-18 g\/m(2) to 116+\/-25 g\/m(2) (p&lt;0.001) and in men group from 107+\/-37 g\/m(2) to 158+\/-28 g\/m(2). Simultaneous treatment with bisoprolol caused a regression of left myocardial hypertrophy. Already after 6 months of simultaneous treatment with L-thyroxin and bisoprolol, for left ventricular mass was reduced to normal: in woman 165+\/-35 g, and in men to 178+\/-38 g. Analogous results were obtained left ventricular mass index. After 6 months it was reduced to 94+\/-12 g\/m(2) in woman and in men to 132+\/-32 g\/m(2). 1. In differentiated thyroid cancer patients, treated postoperatively with L-thyroxine suppressive therapy, left ventricular hypertrophy is observed already during the first year of suppressive therapy and progresses during the next year of treatment. 2 Addition of a beta-adrenergic antagonist to suppressive doses of L-thyroxine causes a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, thus, beta-adrenergic antagonists should be administered in this group of patients. ","1149":"Cardiac natriuretic peptide hormones, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), are synthesized and secreted by the heart, producing several biological effects, such as natriuresis, vasorelaxation and hypotension. During the last decade these peptides, especially BNP, have received increasing attention as potential markers of cardiovascular disease. Their measurements can be used to diagnose heart failure, including diastolic dysfunction, and using them has been shown to save money. BNP levels can enable the differentiation between dyspnoic patients secondary to ventricular dysfunction and subjects with primary respiratory disorders. Moreover, there is good evidence that natriuretic peptides may have a diagnostic role in arterial hypertension, acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary hypertension, some valvular heart disease and some disorders affecting other systems (diabetes or thyroid disorders). In this paper we discuss the clinical utility of assessment of natriuretic peptide hormones in the diagnosis of various clinical conditions and their use as pharmacological agents.","1150":"Acromegaly can be treated with several medical modalities. The growth hormone (GH) receptor antagonist pegvisomant, in particular, is able to reduce serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations to almost any desired level. Along with this important achievement come other practical issues. The most important is that IGF-I also has metabolic actions, especially the control of serum glucose concentrations. As somatostatin analogues and pegvisomant have their own intrinsic differential effects on serum GH levels and actions as well as on serum IGF-I levels and actions, it should not automatically be assumed that absolute concentrations of these parameters of disease activity reflect the same levels of action. In the ideal situation we should be able to develop treatment of specific target levels for both GH and IGF-I that might even be patient-specific as well. To date we have not moved as far as this, but awareness of treatment-specific differential effects might help us to understand some of the signs and symptoms that we encounter in acromegalic patients.","1151":"Different types of treatment, including surgery, medical therapy and radiotherapy, are possible in achieving control of acromegaly. Of the medical therapies available, somatostatin analogues are effective in the majority of patients and can induce pituitary tumour shrinkage. The rationale and outcome of somatostatin analogue treatment before surgery in patients with acromegaly is briefly presented. In summary, the benefits of somatostatin analogues given preoperatively should be considered carefully as optimisation of cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic functions is clinically relevant for perioperative morbidity. Somatostatin analogues also induce significant shrinkage of GH-secreting pituitary tumours, although this does not seem to be helpful in terms of improved surgical outcome.","1152":"Consensus statement of the Polish Society of Endocrinology, regarding presurgical somatostatin analogs in acromegaly has been presented. It is suggested to administer depot somatostatin analog (Octreotide LAR at the dose 20 mg and then 30 mg or equivalent doses of Lanreotide Autogel 90\/120 mg every 4 weeks) in order to normalize or suppress to a maximal extent GH and IGF-1 concentrations. The period of therapy in case of microadenoma would be at least 3 months (targets: biochemical improvement, reduced risk of disease's complications, perioperative risk reduction, inhibition of tumor growth). The period of therapy in case of macroadenoma would be at least 6 months, until maximal possible reduction of GH and IGF-1 concentrations (targets: tumor shrinkage, biochemical improvement, reduced risk of disease's complications, perioperative risk reduction). Using an uniform approach in a group, as numerous as possible, of treated patients would allow objective evaluation of long-term efficacy of the treatment.","1153":"Pseudohypoparathyroidism includes a genotypically diverse group of syndromes that resembles primary hypoparathyroidism but is caused by primary resistance to parathormone. Several variants of pseudohypoparathyroidism have been identified, and pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a is the best understood form of the disease. In many but not all patients, the disease results from heterozygous inactivating mutations of Gs a, the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric stimulatory G-protein. In this article, we describe the case of a 51-year-old male with clinical picture of atypical pseudohypoparathyroidism. The coexistence of this disorder with chronic thyroiditis and pernicious anemia suggested that autoimmune processes were involved in the mechanism of resistance to parathormone in this patient.","1154":"The role of adipose tissue is energy storage, but there is increasing evidence that adipocytes and adipokines are involved in metabolic and inflammatory processes. This paper reviews the pathophysiology of different adipose tissue depots. Interrelationships between sex hormones, adipose tissue and risk factors are also discussed. Present study focuses on the effects of adipokines on immune system and on the mechanisms relating adiposity to cancer risk.","1155":"Growth hormone (GH) is a well established participant in several complex physiological processes including growth, differentiation, and metabolism. Recombinant human GH is a drug that has been approved for use for several clinical conditions where the action of GH is diminished or completely lacking. Thus there is considerable interest in developing novel drugs that modify the function of GH. Only in the last several decades have the detailed structural features of GH along with its interaction with its receptor been elucidated. In this review we summarise the basic structural and functional properties of GH, its receptor and their interaction. In addition, we discuss the discovery and development of an effective GH receptor antagonist, pegvisomant, and summarise potential therapeutic uses of this drug.","1156":"Nutrition therapy is an integral part of the management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Most women with GDM are treated by nutritional management alone. The goal of our study was to compare low and high carbohydrate diets in their effectiveness, safety and tolerability in women with GDM. The study group consisted of 30 Caucasian women newly diagnosed with GDM, with a mean age of 28.7 +\/- 3.7 years and pregnancy duration of 29.2 +\/- 5.4 weeks. The patients were randomised into two groups: those on a low and those on a high carbohydrate diet (45% vs. 65% respectively of energy supply coming from carbohydrates). The presence of urine ketones was controlled every day. After two weeks daily glucose profiles and compliance with the recommended diets were analysed. Glucose concentration before implementation of the diet regimen did not differ between groups. No changes in fasting blood glucose were noticed in the group that had followed a low carbohydrate diet, although a significant decrease in glucose concentration was observed after breakfast (102 +\/- 16 vs. 94 +\/- 11 mg\/dl), lunch (105 +\/- 12 vs. 99 +\/- 9 mg\/dl) and dinner (112 +\/- 16 vs. 103 +\/- 13 mg\/dl) (p &lt; 0.05). In the high carbohydrate diet group fasting and after-breakfast glucose concentration did not change. A significant decrease in glycaemia was noticed after lunch (106 +\/- 15 vs. 96 +\/- 7 mg\/dl) and dinner (107 +\/- 12 vs. 97 +\/- 7 mg\/dl) (p &lt; 0.05). Ketonuria was not observed in either group. Obstetrical outcomes did not differ between groups. Both high and low carbohydrate diets are effective and safe. A diet with carbohydrate limitation should be recommended to women who experience the highest glycaemia levels after breakfast. ","1157":"Apoptosis, programmed cell death is a regulating mechanism enabling the removal of superabundantly produced and unnecessary at the certain moment cells. Disturbances of the apoptosis regulation contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disorders. The aim of this study was to estimate expression of proapoptotic Fas\/FasL and caspase-8 in thyroid tissues in patients with Graves' disease (GD), non-toxic nodular goiter (NTNG) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Inclusion criteria of Graves' patients were: large goiter, ophthalmopathy, TRAb &gt; 5 U\/L, positive titre of anti-TPO and anti-TG antibodies and concentration of TSH &lt; 0.45 microIU\/mL for more the 2-3 months from an onset of the disease. Isolated thyrocytes were identified by indirect method: in the first stage mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) anti-TPO were bound to rabbit anti-mouse antibodies IgG (Fab')2 labeled FITC. To obtained cellular suspension mAbs directed against apoptotic Fas\/FasL molecules labeled with PE (Phycoerythrin) was added. All investigations were performed on Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer. Detection of apoptotic proteins was confirmed by Western Blot and immunohistochemistry methods using mAbs in DAB chromogene visuality and marked by Mayer's haematoxylin. Evaluation of caspase-8 expression in thyroid follicular cells was performed by Western Blot test. The analysis of Fas and FasL expression on surface of thyroid follicular cells was higher in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (38%, 26%) in comparison with patients with Graves' disease (18%, 14%). In case of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis significantly lower percentage of thyroid tissue infiltrating immune Fas+ (13%) and FasL+ (22%) T cells in comparison with Graves' patients (33%, 43% respectively) was observed . Identification of proapoptotic Fas and FasL molecules in the thyroid follicular cells revealed higher expression of both proteins in patients with GD (++,++) and HT (+++; +++, respectively) in comparison with NTNG patients (+\/0; +\/0). Caspase-8 expression was detected in band 55 kDa using Western Blot test in patients with thyroid autoimmune diseases. We conclude that alteration in the expression of proapoptotic proteins in thyroid follicular cells may play a role in pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmune disorders. In addition, suppression of apoptosis in Graves' disease led to increased proliferation of thyroid follicular cells which is responsible for goiter formation. ","1158":"Measurement of the degree of exophthalmos is one of the main methods used in the assessment of pathological processes that occur in the orbital space and is widely used. However, this only provides initial information about the volume relations between the intraorbital structures. The aims of our work were as follows: to draw up a new computer application, namely the numerical segmentation image (NSI) technique, for the automatic calculation of the volume of the intraorbital structures on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, to determine its usefulness in the segmentation of fatty tissue and the eyeball and to estimate their volume in relation to the degree of exophthalmos. A total of 45 patients (90 orbits) were included in the study. All the patients underwent MRI examination of the orbits by a 1.5 T scanner using a head coil. The degree of exophthalmos was determined clinically and radiologically in relation to the interzygomatic line. Quantitative assessment of the eyeball and fatty tissue was made using an NSI application. The influence of fatty tissue volume on the degree of exophthalmos was determined as being statistically significant (r = 0.367, p = 0.000374) but was smaller in comparison with the relationship between total eye muscle volume and degree of exophthalmos; eyeball volume was found to have the least influence (r = 0.344, p = 0.000374). Two eyeballs of significantly smaller volume were found in the group of 90 orbits analysed. The NSI technique is a clinically useful application, providing objective data calculated individually for each orbit. A credible protocol for estimating the degree of exophthalmos on the basis of the NSI technique should include the eye muscle volume, fatty tissue volume and, in cases where eyeball pathologies coexist, the eyeball volume as well. ","1159":"Symptoms of precocious puberty (PP) in children always arouse anxiety in their parents. Many children with PP are being hospitalized for the detailed diagnostic work-up. The aim of our study was to analyze the frequency of the variants of PP in children referred to our department. Retrospective analysis of 119 children (103 girls and 16 boys) referred for hospitalization in the years 2003-2005 due to signs of precocious puberty was performed. Premature thelarche, benign variant of puberty, was diagnosed in 62 (53%) girls, in the mean age of 3.39 (+\/- 2.33) years. Their mean height was within 0.7 +\/- 1.1 SD. Premature pubarche was diagnosed 30 (25%) children--22 girls and 8 boys in the mean age was 7.24 (+\/- 0.81) years. Their mean height was 1.3 +\/- 1.0 SD and was significantly higher than normal (p &lt; 0.0001). Premature menarche was diagnosed in 8 (7%) girls in the mean age 4.81 +\/-2.26 years. Mean height in this group was normal for age (0.9+\/-0.8 SD). PP was diagnosed in 19 (16%) children (11 girls and 8 boys) in the mean age 5.91 +\/- 1.63 years. Mean height in this group was 1.6 +\/- 0.7 SD, and was significantly higher than the mean for age (p&lt;0.0005). GnRH-dependent type was present in 15 children, diagnosed as idiopathic in 9 girls and 1 boy. In 5 children (4 boys and 1 girl) pathology of central nervous system was found. In 4 children GnRH-independent precocious puberty was diagnosed--in 3 caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia and in 1 boy by tumour of testis (leydigioma). Girls with precocious thelarche without growth acceleration present the benign variant of puberty and need clinical follow up only. Boys with clinical signs of precocious puberty should be carefully evaluated to rule out the organic cause. ","1160":"Prolactin (Prl) is secreted in a circadian pattern, although no method of interpreting it has yet been established. The aim of the study was to assess Prl secretion in children on the basis of the Prl circadian profile and to establish principles for the interpretation of the results obtained by this method. The analysis comprised 41 healthy short children (25 boys); aged 5.2-16.3 years, in whom hormonal disorders and chronic diseases had been excluded. The children were divided into prepubertal or pubertal subgroups. Serum Prl concentrations were measured every 3 hours for 24 hours. To assess the rhythm the parameters of macroscopic analysis were calculated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. The group for comparison consisted of 30 children aged 8.9-17.2 years with hyperprolactinaemia. In each subgroup significantly higher Prl concentrations were observed at night than by day. No statistical differences were noticed between the groups regarding Prl concentrations at particular time points or parameter values during circadian Prl rhythm evaluation. In the group analysed weak correlations were found between age and Prl peak and trough levels. On the basis of ROC analysis criteria for the existence of normal circadian Prl rhythm in children were established. 1. The presence of normal circadian Prl rhythm is observed if at least one of the following three criteria is fulfilled: amplitude &gt;1.8779; X(n)\/X(d) ratio &gt;1.685; regression index &lt;-0.4107. 2. No interpretation in relation to sex, age and stage of puberty is necessary for the circadian prolactin secretion rhythm in children. ","1161":"Latent Autoimmune Diabetes In Adults (LADA) is a form of autoimmune-mediated diabetes in adults. The progression of beta-cell failure is slower than in childhood type 1 diabetes. Patients with LADA present with more preserved beta-cell function than those with classic type 1 diabetes. The diagnosis of LADA according to Immunology of Diabetes Society is based on three features: age over 35 years, the presence at least one of four circulating autoantibodies to pancreatic islet cell antigens and lack of requirement for insulin at least 6 month after diagnosis. The level of C-peptide secretion after stimulation with intravenous glucagon helped to diagnosis. There are different opinions in relation to treatment of LADA. Some studies suggest, that insulin treatment is indicated at the time of diagnosis LADA, some of them--when patients upon failure of oral hypoglycemic treatment.","1162":"We present a case of a woman with unique multisystem disorder--POEMS syndrome and endocrine abnormalities coexisting with it. The POEMS acronym comprises the dominant features: polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein (M protein), skin changes. Association between plasma cell dyscrasia and polyneuropathy, was described in 1956 year by Crow. The main features were coined in the acronym POEMS by Bardwick in 1980 year. The polysymptomatic clinical picture, progressive course and no-concurrent manifestations of main features impede the diagnosis. In this case, the first symptoms were the sensomotor polyneuropathy, peripheral oedema, osteosclerotic bone lesions, skin changes, organomegaly. They preceded diagnosis by 3 years. The first endocrinopathy was hypothyroidism. Definite diagnosis was delayed because we couldn't detect the presence of M protein. Immunoelectrophoresis didn't detect it, but analysis by immunofixation detected M protein in serum and urine. Within 3 years of the first symptoms, she developed hypogonadism hypergonadotropic. At first, the monotherapy with corticosteroids was used, then--melfalan with prednisone. Due to the progression of the disease, a thalidomide was used in therapy (it is anti-VEGF agent). One of the side effects of the treatment of thalidomide is the progression of polyneuropathy, which was observed in this patient. After finishing this therapy she received chemotherapy. This case report imposes the necessity of constants observation of patients with POEMS syndrome because there is a possibility of their developing other disorders. In the event of coexistence polyneuropathy and plasma cell dyscrasia, this disease should be taken into consideration.","1163":"Thyroid hormones are essential to maintain normal function of many systems including the cardiovascular system. Their excess or deficiency may upset human body homeostasis. Hyperthyroidism leads to cardiovascular system's hyperdynamic status which is characterized by tachycardia, increased difference between systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, significant increase of the stroke volume and improvement of the left ventricular diastolic function. Long-lasting thyrotoxicosis in patient with heart disease may result in atrial fibrillation, deterioration of angina pectoris or congestive heart failure. Hypothyroidism leads to hemodynamic disturbances which are quite different than those observed in hyperthyroidism, but cardiac symptoms are scant in clinical practice. Hypothyroidism's clinical significance is limited to atherosclerosis progression and intensification of ischaemic heart disease symptoms. Both leads to symptomatic cardiovascular system failure or its deterioration. We should emphasize that cardiovascular system dysfunction associated with thyrometabolic disturbances subsides when euthyreosis is restored. It sounds promising that there are reports suggesting a potential advantage of thyroxin treatment in patients with acute or chronic cardiovascular system diseases. These hypotheses result from the observations that heart dysfunction in hypothyroidism is similar to that observed in heart failure.","1164":"Epidemiological and observational studies suggest that oestrogens, when used as hormonal therapy in post-menopausal women, can increase the risk of breast cancer if used long term. However, more recent data suggest that short-term use in sub-groups of post-menopausal women significantly decreases the risk of breast cancer. This beneficial effect is also observed when high-dose oestrogen is administered to post-menopausal women with breast cancer to cause tumour regression, a phenomenon which commonly occurs. We consider these divergent responses to oestrogen to represent a \"paradox\". Data from our own and other investigative groups suggest a hypothesis to explain this paradox. Deprivation of oestradiol in model systems causes cells to adapt and to undergo apoptosis in response to oestrogen. This occurs through the Fas\/Fas ligand death receptor pathway and through alterations in apoptotic mechanisms mediated by mitochondria. This process of programmed cell death may explain the regression of established breast cancer with oestrogen administration and the diminution in the rate of new breast cancer diagnoses recently reported. Our hypothesis is based upon pathological data indicating the presence of a \"reservoir\" of undiagnosed breast cancer in the population of women who would be starting on oestrogens as menopausal hormonal therapy. The long-term increased risk of breast cancer may then reflect different mechanisms. Oestrogens can cause mutations through enhancement of the rate of cell division and concomitantly the error rate in DNA replication. In addition, oestrogens can be metabolised to directly genotoxic compounds. These carcinogenic processes take much longer, since a number of mutations must accumulate before resulting in breast cancer. These hypotheses regarding oestrogen-induced apoptosis in the short term and carcinogenesis in the long term now require rigorous verification but would serve to explain the \"oestrogen paradox\".","1165":"The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of DHEA therapy on fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) plasma concentrations in men with decreased serum DHEA-S levels and angiographically verified coronary heart disease (CHD). The study included thirty men aged 41-60 years (mean age 52 +\/- 0.90 yr) with serum DHEA-S concentration &lt; 2000 mg\/l, who were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Subjects completed the 80 days study of 40 days of 150 mg oral DHEA daily or placebo, and next groups were changed after 30 days of wash-out. Fasting early morning blood samples were obtained at baseline and after each treatment to determine serum hormones levels (testosterone, DHEA-S, LH, FSH and estradiol) and also fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) plasma concentrations. Administration of DHEA was associated with 4.5-fold increase in DHEA-S levels. Estrogen levels significantly increased after DHEA from 22.1 +\/- 0.7 pg\/ml to 26.4 +\/- 1.6 pg\/l (mean +\/- SEM; p &lt; 0.05), while testosterone levels did not changed. Fibrinogen concentrations significantly decreased in DHEA group from 4.5 +\/- 0.3 g\/l to 3.83 +\/- 0.2 g\/l (p &lt; 0.05 vs. placebo). Changes of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were not statistical significant (respectively: 8.37 +\/- 0.4 ng\/ml vs. 8.93 +\/- 0.5 ng\/ml and 82.3 +\/- 6.3 ng\/ml vs. 92.7 +\/- 9.1 ng\/ml (mean +\/- SEM; NS vs. placebo).

DHEA therapy in dose of 150 mg daily during 40 days in men with DHEAS levels &lt; 2000 mg\/l and angiographically verified coronary heart disease (CHD) was connected with significant decreasing of fibrinogen concentration and increasing of estradiol levels, and did not influence on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) plasma concentrations. ","1166":"Surgical excision of adrenocortical tumour in patients with ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome gives a chance for their entire cure. However in some patients after adrenalectomy persistent arterial hypertension, obesity and diabetes mellitus is observed. The aim of the study was to analyse long term consequences of surgical excision of cortisol producing adrenocortical adenoma with a special attention on the influence of adrenalectomy on arterial blood pressure. 15 patients (mean age 54 years) suffering from arterial hypertension (n = 15), obesity or overweight (n = 12) and diabetes mellitus (n = 7) were subjected to analysis. Mean follow up time was 45 months. Improvement of blood pressure control after unilateral adrenalectomy was observed in 66.7% of patients. The risk factor of no improvement of blood pressure control was BMI &gt; 30.5 kg\/m(2) (RR = 4.0 [1.07-14.90]). During the follow up period decrease of maximal values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed (34 [17-50] and 25 [16-35] mm Hg respectively; p &lt; 0.01). In the entire group of patients a 3.4 kg\/m(2) decrease of BMI was observed p = 0.01. BMI decreased significantly (more than 1 kg\/m(2)) in 66.7% of patients. Only in 2 patients a complete regression of diabetes was observed. 46.7% of patients required supplementation with adrenal steroids. 40% of patients reported a subjective withdrawal of all symptoms of the disease after surgery and 46.7% only partial remission. Surgical excision of cortisol producing adrenocortical adenoma results in improvement of blood pressure control and body weight reduction in a large percentage of patients with Cushing syndrome. Obesity before adrenalectomy is the factor that reduces a chance for improvement of blood pressure control after surgery. ","1167":"Some studies indicate, that the Trp(64)\/Arg(64) polymorphism of beta(3)-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and earlier onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of our study was evaluation of frequency of this ADRB3 polymorphism and his association with metabolic syndrome parameters and oxidative stress in postmenopausal women. We performed the study among 94 women, aged 50-60, selected randomly from Wroclaw city population. Estimation of anthropometric parameters, densitometry (total body fat, android and gynoid deposits--using DPX(+) Lunar, USA device) and biochemical estimations such as lipid profile, glucose, insulin, estradiol and FSH serum level (using commercial kits) were carried out. Oxidative stress was estimated by measurement of thiobarbituric-reactive substances (TBARS) serum concentration, using Yagi method, on spectrofluorimeter Perkin-Elmer LS55. Blood for analysis was collected before, direct after and 6 h after the 30-minutes physical test using cycloergometer. ADRB3 genotyping was performed by PCR and mini-sequencing using ABI 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The frequency of Trp(64)\/Arg(64) genotype in investigated population was 15.8%. The Arg(64)\/Arg(64) genotype had only one woman. Women bearing Trp(64)\/Arg(64) genotype showed higher mean serum level of triglycerides and lower serum level of HDL-cholesterol in comparison to women bearing Trp(64)\/Trp(64) genotype, however without statistical significance (p &gt; 0.05) (respectively, means +\/- SD for triglycerides: 140.3 +\/- 64.1 vs. 113.9 +\/- 56.2 mg\/dl; and for HDL-cholesterol: 60.9 +\/- 11.9 vs. 67.0 +\/- 16.9 mg\/dl). Both groups did not differ in any other investigated anthropometric nor biochemical parameter. 1. The Trp(64)\/Arg(64) polymorphism of beta(3)-adrenergic receptor could be associated with lipid profile disorders observed in metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women, however it should be explained basing on the study with more included subjects. 2. The Trp(64)\/Arg(64 )polymorphism of beta(3)-adrenergic receptor has no influence on oxidative stress intensification after standardized physical effort in postmenopausal women.

All patients presented signs and symptoms typical of thyrotoxicosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory tests (TSH, fT(3), fT(4), TSH-R antibodies). Sera of control subjects were obtained from 10 healthy blood donors, 7 women, 3 men (age range 21-45 yrs, median: 30.6 +\/- 7.1). Incidence of pituitary autoantibodies was assessed by polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and western-blotting. Pituitary microsomes were obtained from human pituitary tissues by ultracentrifugation and solubilisation in 1% desoxycholic acid. In 23 sera from 32 we detected autoantibodies against pituitary microsomal antigens. 16 sera were reacting with 55 kDa antigen, 10 sera with 67 kDa, 6 sera with 60 kDa, 5 sera with 52 kDa and 4 sera with 105 kDa. It is important to note that 6 sera were reacting with 57 and 55 kDa, and 5 sera with 55, 60 and 67 kDa. In sera of Graves' disease patients autoantibodies against pituitary microsomal antigens can be frequently detected. The most frequent are antibodies against 55, 60 and 67 kDa antigens. ","1169":"INTRODUCTION, MATERIAL AND METHODS: Visfatin is a cytokine, mainly expressed in visceral fat, that exerts insulin-mimicking effects in rodents through activation of an insulin receptor, although the binding-site is distinct from that of insulin. However, the mechanisms that regulate visfatin synthesis are still not fully understood. In particular, it is not clear whether short-term glucose-induced hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia as well as a glucocorticoid-induced increase in insulin resistance are reflected in appreciable alterations in serum visfatin levels in humans. In order to investigate this we measured serum visfatin, glucose and insulin concentrations during a 75.0 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [Study 1], as well as before and after oral administration of dexamethasone [Study 2]. Study 1 included 17 subjects (2 males), aged 35.7 +\/- 15.6 (mean +\/- SD) years of BMI 35.2 +\/- 9.3 kg\/m(2). Blood samples were taken before (0 minutes) and at 60 and 120 minutes after glucose administration. Study 2 included 20 subjects (4 males, 5 subjects with type 2 diabetes), aged 42.1 +\/- 17.2 years of BMI 36.7 +\/- 8.38 kg\/m(2) who underwent screening for Cushing's disease\/syndrome. Dexamethasone was administered at a dose of 0.5 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Fasting serum concentrations of visfatin, glucose and insulin were assessed before (D0) and after 48 hours of dexamethasone administration (D2). Insulin resistance was assessed according to the HOMA method in non-diabetic individuals (n = 15). In Study 1 two subjects were found to have impaired glucose tolerance and one subject was found to have diabetes mellitus. Glucose administration resulted in a highly significant increase in insulin (from 11.4 +\/- 7.2 microU\/mL at 0 min to 98.9 +\/- 68.6 microU\/mL at 60 min and 72.6 +\/- 45.1 microU\/mL at 120 minute of OGTT, p &lt; 0.001 for 60 and 120 minutes in comparison to baseline). However, there was no change in serum visfatin concentrations (84.6 +\/- 11.6 ng\/mL at 0 minutes, 82.6 +\/- 12.7 ng\/mL at 60 minutes and 81.1 +\/- 14.5 ng\/mL at 120 minutes of OGTT, p = ns). All subjects in Study 2 achieved suppression of cortisol concentrations below 50 nmo\/l. Dexamethasone administration resulted in an increase in fasting insulin (from 11.5 +\/- 6.9 to 16.9 +\/- 7.6 microU\/mL; p = 0.011) and an increase in HOMA (from 2.73 +\/- 1.74 to 4.02 +\/- 2.27; p = 0.015), albeit without a significant change in serum visfatin concentrations (61.1 +\/- 19.8 vs. 68.3 +\/- 19.4 ng\/mL, p = ns). In neither Study 1 nor Study 2 was there any significant correlation between serum visfatin and age, BMI or HOMA. There is a striking difference between the marked rise in insulin concentrations and the lack of change in visfatin concentrations during the oral glucose tolerance test. This implies that it is highly unlikely that visfatin is involved in the short-term regulation of glucose homeostasis in human subjects. Dexamethasone administration (4 mg\/48 hours) induces an increase in insulin resistance, although without significant change in serum visfatin concentrations. Therefore in contrast to the in vitro data, short term glucocorticoid administration does not result in appreciable changes in serum levels of this adipocytokine. Furthermore, the results of our study do not support the notion that glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance is likely to be related to changes in serum concentrations of visfatin. ","1170":"Assessment of growth hormone (GH) secretion is based on stimulation tests. Low GH peaks in stimulation tests, together with decreased insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) secretion, confirm a diagnosis of GH deficiency (GHD). However, limitations in interpreting the test results and discrepancies between GH and IGF-I secretion in particular patients have both been reported. GH therapy should improve the prognosis of adult height (PAH). The aim of the study was to compare the deficit of height at diagnosis, IGF-I secretion and PAH in children with either decreased (in varying degrees of severity) or normal GH secretion in stimulation tests. The analysis comprised 540 short children (373 boys, 167 girls), aged 11.7 +\/- 3.2 years. In all the patients two GH stimulation tests were performed, IGF-I serum concentration was measured, bone age was assessed and PAH was calculated. According to the GH peak in the two stimulation tests, the patients were classified into the following groups: severe GHD (sGHD)--GH peak &lt; 5 ng\/mL (n = 44), partial GHD (pGHD)--GH peak 5-10 ng\/mL (n = 190), idiopathic short stature (ISS)--GH peak at least 10 ng\/mL (n = 306). A significantly greater deficit of height, lower IGF-I secretion and worse PAH were observed in sGHD than in both remaining groups, while all the differences between pGHD and ISS in the parameters analysed were insignificant. The results obtained indicate the necessity of applying another methods of qualifying short children for GH therapy other than GH stimulation tests with a cut-off value at a level of 10 ng\/mL.

Two cases of primary papillary carcinoma of the thyroid in TGDR in young girls are presented. The diagnostic and therapeutic problems are shared, and up-to-date management guidelines in similar cases are discussed.","1173":"Ageing is doubtless complicated, lifelong process regarding many body systems, including endocrine system. Human hormonal system changes with age. Although these changes concern secretion of many hormones, they are not unidirectional, there are hormones secretion of which is diminished, whereas secretion of the others is augmented or not changed with age. A possible role of hormones which are often termed \"hormones of youth\"(growth hormone, melatonin, and dehydroepiandrosterone) in the ageing process is discussed in the present article. Although some experimental and clinical data indicate that these hormones may play some role in the human ageing process, it appears from presented data that we are still far away from conclusion that, indeed, one (or more) of the discussed hormones could be considered as \"hormone of youth\", which may slow down ageing process. However, some symptoms of the quality of life improvement following administration of dehydroepiandrosterone, melatonin, and growth hormone may suggest that they may promote so called \"successful aging\".","1174":"There is a growing number of diseases which prevalence can be associated with vitamin D deficiency. The link between low cholecalciferol concentration and bone diseases is well established, however there is also data suggesting that it may influence development and progression of different cancers and autoimmune diseases. The in vitro studies proved that the active vitamin D metabolite--1,25(OH)(2)D(3) may arrest the cell cycle progression, induce apoptosis as well as regulate T cells and antigen presenting cells function. Results of the in vivo experiments suggest that vitamin D deficiency accelerates development of autoimmune diseases and cancers in animals. Epidemiological studies imply that the vitamin D deficiency is also associated with the increased incidence of autoimmune diseases and cancers in people. The main determinant of vitamin D serum concentration in a human body is skin synthesis. The changes in the lifestyle, air pollution as well as a common use of sun screens caused that the contemporary European receives little sunlight compared to his ancestors. According to the recent epidemiological studies, the vitamin D concentrations in serum of people who live in high latitudes (above 34 degrees N\/S), including Poland, is far from being sufficient. This paper reviews results of the recent studies concerning the potential role of the vitamin D in the development of cancers and autoimmune diseases, as well as provides guidelines for vitamin D supplementation.","1175":"Obese patients may have abnormal calcium homeostasis because of unbalanced diet and decreased sun exposure. Bariatric surgery itself may lead to disturbances in calcium homeostasis (and in consequence changes in bone mass) or increase preexisting metabolic derangements. The aim of the study was: 1. To assess calcium homeostasis and biochemical markers of bone turnover in patients with morbid obesity. 2. To determine the impact of bariatric surgery on parameters mentioned above. 3. To establish recommendations for supplementation with calcium and vitamin D in morbidly obese patients after bariatric surgery. Serum calcium, parathormone (PTH), vitamin D (25(OH)D), biochemical markers of bone turnover (beta-CrossLaps as a marker of bone resorption and osteocalcin as a marker of bone formation) and urine calcium as well as fat mass, lean mass and bone mineral content (by DXA) were measured before bariatric surgery of the stomach (VBG or GBP) in 57 morbidly obese patients (48 women, 9 men; mean age 35.9 y). The same procedures were repeated six months after operation in 28 of them (24 women, 4 men). Daily calcium intake was also determined based on food questionnaire. Biochemical findings in the group of patients before bariatric surgery were as follows: serum calcium, beta-CrossLaps and urine calcium were within normal range, PTH concentration was increased to 81.0 pg\/ml and 25(OH)D as well as osteocalcin concentration decreased (4.9 ng\/ml and 13.6 ng\/ml, respectively). Six months after bariatric surgery there was no change in serum and urine calcium, PTH concentration decreased to normal level (46.8 pg\/ml), 25(OH)D concentration increased to 6.5 ng\/ml (not significant) and still remained below normal range. Markers of bone turnover--both resorption and formation--increased (beta-CrossLaps over normal range to 0.594 ng\/ml, osteocalcin to normal range 26.8 ng\/ml). Daily calcium intake was below RDA before and after bariatric procedure. 1. Patients with morbid obesity have secondary hyperparathyroidism and deficiency of vitamin D. 2. Abrupt weight loss after bariatric surgery is accompanied by the regression of secondary hyperparathyroidism, decrease of the deficiency of vitamin D and increase in bone turnover. 3. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium is recommended for patients with morbid obesity after bariatric surgery. ","1176":"Chromogranin A (CgA) is a non-specific marker of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and is important in monitoring the disease course and NET treatment. Usefulness of suppression test of CgA secretion with octreotide in diagnosis and predicting the therapy outcome in NET patients. The study included 32 patients with NET of gastrointestinal tract, lung and of unknown origin. CgA level in blood plasma on fasting, before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after subcutaneous administration of 100 mug octreotide, was determined in all patients. The subjects were divided into two subgroups with relation to CgA level and to the results of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS). Statistically significant CgA decrease after octreotide administration in all study time points and positive results of SRS were found in the patients with the elevated CgA level. No statistically significant decrease of CgA level after octreotide was found in the group with normal CgA levels. In this group, 13 patients had a negative result of SRS, and somatostatin receptors expression was found in one patient. Tolerance of somatostatin analogs (SSA) therapy was very good. Octreotide suppression test with CgA level assessment in NET patients is a simple, straightforward examination, providing information on the predicted response to the applied SSA and the data on initial clinical tolerance of those agents. This examination can also be a screening test useful in planning the treatment with SSA in patients with NET. ","1177":"Osteopenia and osteoporosis because of hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma may be followed by an increased risk of fracture. There are no data on the bone effects of functional hyperprolactinaemia. The aim was to assess the influence of hyperprolactinaemia of various origins on bone turnover and density in different skeletal sites. The study was carried out in 75 women (aged 30.53 +\/- 7.8): Group I--32 women with prolactinoma and Group II--43 women with functional hyperprolactinaemia. Both groups of patients were subdivided into those with hypogonadism and those with normal gonadal function. The control group consisted of 29 healthy women aged (33.59 +\/- 4.7). In all subjects PRL and bone turnover markers (BAP, OC, ICTP) were studied. BMD measurements (lumbar spine, forearm, proximal femur and total body) were carried out using DXA. Higher PRL concentrations were observed in patients than in controls. The values of bone turnover markers (BAP, ICTP) were shown to be higher in patient groups and subgroups than in controls. In patients with prolactinoma lumbar spine BMD was lower than in patients with functional hyperprolactinaemia and controls. Total body BMD was also lower, albeit to a lesser extent. Hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma in women influences bone metabolism unfavourably, more by the impact on the activity of bone turnover markers than on BMD. This provides an opportunity for earlier assessment of bone metabolism disturbances before the BMD changes can be observed. Functional hyperprolactinaemia does not determine such a harmful effect on bone metabolism as hyperprolactinemia due to prolactinoma. ","1178":"In recent years the use of computer systems has allowed numerical analysis of medical images to be introduced and has speeded up the conversion of numerical data into clinically valuable information. The creation of a software application that could almost automatically calculate the volume of anatomical structures imaged by MRI has seemed possible. The aim of our study was to determine the clinical usefulness of an numerical segmentation image technique (NSI) software application in estimating the volume of extraocular muscles. The study group was formed of 45 patients (90 orbits). All the patients underwent MRI examinations of the orbits by a 1.5 T scanner using a head coil. The degree of exophthalmos was determined clinically and radiologically in relation to the interzygomatic line. The quantitative assessment of all eye muscles was carried out using the NSI application, a new software program introduced by the authors. A close correlation between muscle volume and the degree of exophthalmos was revealed and confirmed by statistical analysis (r = 0.543, p = 3.13396E-08) in agreement with other papers. The NSI software program is an application which offers a reliable and precise estimation of eye muscle volume. It is therefore useful in the diagnosis of the pathological processes leading to exophthalmos. It has special clinical value for monitoring discrete volume changes of muscles during treatment. ","1179":"The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of corticosteroids on soluble MMP-2, MMP-9 and VCAM-1 in patients with Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) in order to assess their usefulness as a guideline in a therapeutic approach. Serum gelatinases and VCAM-1 were detected in three groups of subjects: 20 patients with GO (CAS &gt; or = 3, anamnesis of GO &gt; or = 1 yr), 12 patients with no clinical symptoms of ophthalmopathy (Gd) and 10 healthy volunteers. Corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous infusions (2 series, 3 grams each time) of methylprednisolone (MP) and subsequent treatment with oral prednisone (60 mg per day) in a tapering schedule. The serum samples were collected 24 hours before MP, 24 hours after MP, after 14 days of treatment with prednisone and at the end of corticosteroid therapy. The levels of soluble MMP-2, MMP-9 and VCAM-1 were determined by the ELISA method. We have found no differences in serum MMP-2 between the groups studied and a significant reduction after MP only in corticosteroid-resistant GO patients. Soluble MMP-9 was highest in the GO group compared with both the Gd and control individuals. Moreover serum MMP-9 decreased in corticosteroid-responsive GO patients after MP and remained at the lower level at the end of the study. Positive correlations between MMP-2 and MMP-9 before and after MP administration were observed. Serum VCAM-1 was significantly elevated both in GO and Gd subjects and pre-treatment VCAM-1 levels were elevated in corticosteroid-responders compared with non-responders. Our results suggest that serum VCAM-1 may serve as a marker predicting the efficacy of corticosteroids and that soluble MMP-9 may be helpful in monitoring corticosteroid administration and in decision-making with regard to further GO treatment. ","1180":"At present the most widely accepted tool for follow-up management of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients is serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement. It is not uncommon for the serum Tg level to be measured while the patient is taking thyroid hormones (on-treatment Tg measurement). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of on-treatment measurement of serum Tg in detecting remnant\/recurrent or metastatic disease in high-risk DTC patients. We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 26 high-risk DTC patients and compared the on-treatment and off-treatment Tg levels of these patients. All patients were anti-Tg negative. Using off-treatment measurement of Tg as the gold standard, the results of on-treatment measurement of Tg in the diagnosis of remnant\/recurrent disease were analysed for sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV). The median serum Tg level under thyroid hormone suppressive therapy (on-treatment Tg) was 16.5 ng\/ml and after withdrawal of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy (off-treatment Tg) was 95.0 ng\/ml (P value = 0.001). In 6 patients (23%) the on-treatment Tg level missed the recurrence of the disease. Regarding the off-treatment Tg as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the on-treatment Tg measurement were 72.7%, 100%, 100%, and 40% respectively. Normal serum Tg level without TSH-stimulation (on-treatment) is not diagnostically reliable in the follow-up of DTC patients with a high probability of residual\/recurrent or metastatic disease.

The aim of this lecture is to present the up-to-date information concerning the prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of insulinoma.","1182":"The case of 54-year old woman with severe Graves thyrotoxicosis and antithyroid drugs intolerance is presented. She was admitted to Endocrinology Department and therapy with propranolol, lithium, glucocorticoids, iodine contrast media was instituted. Then ablative dose of radioiodine was given; all these appeared to be ineffective. To avoid thyrotoxic storm thyroidectomy was undertaken. Surgical procedure was uneventful and successful. Surgical intervention should be considered in severe life-threatening cases of thyrotoxicosis.","1183":"Polypeptide growth factors form a potent class of extracellular signal molecules in the regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferation. Disturbances in the expression of growth factors influence the normal pathway of differentiation and lead to cellular transformation and tumour progression. Contemporary medical studies report that various growth factors such as those for platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor are expressed in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP\/NET). Polypeptide growth factors have great significance in the growth, progression and development of metastases by various tumours. We describe the role of growth factors in GEP\/NET on the basis of the available reports of medical research.","1184":"Both metabolic syndrome (MS) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are common among women. The exact prevalence of MS in women with PCOS is dependent upon the diagnostic criteria used for each. However, the frequent co-occurrence of both MS and PCOS in women is suggestive of a common aetiology. In this short review article we argue that insulin resistance, as a consequence of abdominal obesity, may represent such a common aetiology. We also review the literature on the prevalence of MS in women with PCOS and consider the impact that the particular criteria used to diagnose both MS and PCOS may have had on these estimates of prevalence.","1185":"The study was undertaken to determine blood serum concentrations of selected steroid hormones (estradiol--E(2), testosterone--T, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate--DHEA-S) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in professional footballers subjected to whole body cryotherapy. Twenty-two clinically healthy males, mean age 26.7 years, were studied. The subjects underwent ten sessions of whole body cryotherapy in Wroclaw-type chamber, with kinesitherapy following each session. Blood samples were collected before and two days after the treatment and the results were analyzed statistically. After the treatment there was a significant decrease in the concentrations of T (6.01 vs. 4.80 ng\/mL, p &lt; 0.01) and E(2) (102.3 vs. 47.5 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.00001), but no DHEA-S and LH. The T\/E(2) ratio showed a significant increase form 72.2 to 136.5 (p &lt; 0.01). Whole body cryotherapy leads to a significant decrease in serum T and E(2), with no effect on LH and DHEAS levels. As a results of cryotherapy, the T\/E(2) ratio was significant increased. The changes observed are probably due to cryotherapy-induced alternation in the blood supply to the skin and subcutaneous tissue, as well as to modulation of the activity of aromatase which is responsible for conversion of testosterone and androstenedione to estrogens. ","1186":"The aim of study was to establish the effectiveness of radioiodine therapy using 131I in the group of patients with multinodular large non-toxic goiter. Therapy was undertaken in female patients disqualified from surgery due to high risk and these patients who didn't agree to surgery. Studies were performed in 7 women (age range: 62-82 yrs) with large goiters (2nd degree according to WHO classification and goiter volume assessed by USG over 100 cm(3)). Serum TSH, fT4, fT3, antithyroid antibodies (TPOAb, TgAb, TRAb) levels, urinary iodine concentration (UIE) were estimated in all patients parallel with radioiodine uptake test (after 5 and 24 hours), 131I thyroid scintigraphy and fine needle biopsy to exclude neoplasmatic transformation. These studies and therapy with 22 mCi 131I were repeated every 3 months. Before therapy median thyroid volume was approximately 145 cm(3) and during therapy gradually decreased to 76 cm(3) after 6 months and to 65 cm(3) after 12 months. Increase of TRAb can be a inhibiting factor of thyroid volume reduction. Other antithyroid antibodies showed marked tendency to rise but without significant correlation with radioiodine uptake and goiter reduction. After 12 months we found 2 patients with clinical and laboratory hypothyroidism. In some cases of multinodular large non-toxic goiter, the radioiodine therapy can be the best alternative way for L-thyroxine treatment or surgery therapy. The fractionated radioiodine therapy of multinodular large non-toxic goiter is safe and effective method but continuation of nodules observation is necessary. ","1187":"In order to be effective, treatment for osteoporosis must be long-term. Unfortunately, according to clinical trials and clinical practice the most frequent cause of patient resignation from the treatment is adverse reactions to the medications. In the case of bisphosphonates they are most frequently connected with irritant impact of the drug on gastrointestinal mucosa. The aim of our study was to answer the question whether alendronate tablets coated with a thin neutral layer may protect gastrointestinal mucosa from the irritant effects of the active substance. Three types of tablets were administered into the cheek pouches of 18 Syrian hamsters (divided into 3 experimental groups: I, II, III) i.e. regular alendronate tablets, coated alendronate tablets and placebo. The tablets were applied for 4 minutes a day on 4 consecutive days. 24 hours after the last application, the animals were sacrificed and segments of buccal tissue were taken for histopathological examination. Oral tissue reaction was assessed using the microscopic examination grading system developed by ISO. The following adverse changes of the tissue were recorded: epithelial lesions, leucocyte infiltration, vascular congestion and oedema. Later the irritation index was calculated. The irritation index was 11.0 (moderately irritant), 0.0 and 0.0 (none-irritant), in each group respectively. It appears that the administration of the coated alendronate tablets reduces the frequency and intensity of the local adverse events from the gastrointestinal tract. ","1188":"Assessment of serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) concentrations in obese patients in comparison to healthy controls and evaluation of a possible correlation between OPG and other markers of bone turnover or calcitropic hormones. 50 obese perimenopausal women without concomitant diseases (BMI 36.7 +\/- 4.1 kg\/m(2), mean age 50.4 +\/- 4.9 yrs). The control group consisted of 19 healthy women (BMI 24.2 +\/- 2.1 kg\/m(2); mean age 53.8 +\/- 5.1 yrs). In all patients serum concentration of OPG, C telopeptide of type I collagen containing the crosslinking site (CTX), osteocalcin, parathormone (PTH) and vitamin D (25-OH-D(3)) was assessed. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (the DXA method) of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was performed using a Lunar DPXL to measure bone marrow density (BMD). In obese perimenopausal women serum OPG, osteocalcin and 25-OH-D(3) levels were significantly lower, and the serum PTH level was significantly higher in comparison to healthy controls. A significantly positive correlation was found between serum OPG level and age in both obese and control subjects. The serum OPG level in obese perimenopausal women is significantly lower in comparison to healthy controls and does not correlate significantly with biochemical markers of bone turnover, calcitropic hormones and BMD. It probably cannot play a protective role in the pathogenesis of bone loss in obese perimenopausal women. ","1189":"Epidemiological studies underline the fact that obesity represents a significant risk factor for the development of several cancers, one of which is cancer of the colon. Moreover, multiple recent data indicate that some adipose tissue-derived hormones may influence the growth of malignant cells. Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is one of these. However, the evidence from research is still contradictory regarding the role of leptin in colon cancer. The aim of our study was to examine the direct effect of leptin at various concentrations (from 10(-5) to 10(-12) M) when applied alone or jointly with fluorouracil (the classical cytotoxic drug for colon cancer) at two concentrations (0.25 mg\/ml and 2.5 mg\/ml) on the growth of murine Colon 38 cancer cells in vitro. Colon 38 cancer cells were preincubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with foetal calf serum for 24 hours. The cells were then cultured for a further 72 hours in the presence of various concentrations of the substances under examination, applied either alone or jointly. The growth of the Colon 38 cell line was assessed by a colorimetric kit based on the modified Mosmann method. We found that leptin increased the growth of murine Colon 38 cancer at concentrations of 10(-6), 10(-7) M and 10(-10), 10(-11), 10(-12) M. Its stimulatory effect was fairly slight, with an increase in cancer growth of 5% to 15% as compared to controls. As we expected, fluorouracil at both the concentrations examined inhibited the growth of Colon 38 cancer maximally up to 28% (2.5 mg\/ml) and 34% (0.25 mg\/ml) of controls, with a stronger effect obtained from higher doses. Leptin did not modulate the cytotoxic effect of fluorouracil applied at the higher concentration (2.5 mg\/ml) but, unexpectedly, at concentrations of 1(-9) and 10(-10) M it heightened the cytotoxic effect of fluorouracil given at a lower concentration (0.25 mg\/ml). These data indicate that leptin is involved in the regulation of colon cancer growth and it may even heighten the cytotoxic effect of fluorouracil. ","1190":"The basic data on hyperprolactinemia (i.e. an excess of PRL above a reference laboratory's upper limits), the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are given in this review. The following issues are discussed: regulation of prolactin (Prl) secretion, definition of hyperprolactinemia, its etiology and pathogenesis as well as its symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment (including medical and surgical therapy). It should be stressed that finding of elevated PRL serum concentrations constitute the beginning of diagnostic procedure and, after exclusion of physiologic, pharmacologic, and other organic causes of increased PRL levels, should be followed by detailed diagnosis including MRI. In patients in whom hyperprolactinemia has been confirmed the treatment with dopamine agonists (with prevalence of cabergoline, followed by quinagoline) is currently considered first-choice therapy. Surgery should be performed only in the patients resistant or intolerant to these agents, or in patients who refuse long-term therapy.","1191":"Lymphocytic hypophysitis is an unusual disorder that nearly exclusively affects women. We present a case of 69 year-old female patient who developed the symptoms of diabetes insipidus and partial insufficiency of the anterior pituitary gland.

After exclusion of other causes of infiltrate in this region and due to evident reaction to glucocorticoid treatment the diagnosis of lymphocytic hypophisitis and hypothalamitis was established.","1192":"The case is reported of a 55-year-old man with diffuse malignant lymphoma type B associated with transient optic chiasm infiltration and visual disturbances but with persistent hypopituitarism, hyperprolactinaemia and diabetes insipidus. The patient was administered chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Repeated MR and CT scans showed optic chiasm infiltration, which disappeared in the course of the chemotherapy but then recurred, changed its appearance and finally disappeared again. In the meantime visual disturbances occurred and disappeared during the therapy. Hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus and hyperprolactinaemia were diagnosed and replacement therapy was administered. Later on abdominal pain occurred, and a CT scan revealed bilateral kidney masses and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. These were diffuse malignant lymphoma with regional lymphonodulitis in histology. Finally, hydrothorax and hydroretroperitoneum were diagnosed. The patient died as a result of systemic complications of the disease. The length of survival time documented following the hypothalamochiasmatic infiltration and diagnosis of lymphoma makes the case an unusual one for patients with CNS lymphoma. Hormonal disturbances accompanying the suprasellar region infiltration are very important from the practical point of view.","1193":"It appears that neoangiogenesis is an important factor in tumour invasion and the formation of metastases in several human cancers, and studies on pro-angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors are therefore of considerable interest to researchers. In this review we present pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors and other growth factors and their role in the formation of new blood vessels in adrenal tumours. Assessment of the angiogenic status of adrenal tumours and their vascular pattern may be useful for discriminating benign from malignant lesions and knowledge of their angiogenesis may be essential to the drawing up of promising treatment strategies for patients with malignant tumours.","1194":"The aim of this review is to present the up-to-date data about adiponectin and it's role in pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Adiponectin is a hormone derived from adipose tissue which regulates energy metabolism, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Serum levels of adiponectin are reduced in obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, plasma adiponectin concentration is inversely associated with LDL-cholesterol, TG and is positively related to HDL-cholesterol. Recent studies have indicated that adiponectin has antiinflammatory and antiatherogenic properties. Review of the data confirmed the hypothesis that adiponectin plays an important role in pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.","1195":"The aim of study was the evaluation of association between psychometric factors in patients with thyroid cancer and in Graves' hyperthyroid patients.

(x +\/- SD: 43 +\/- 8.17 yr.) and 50 hyperthyroid patients, 45 (90%) females and 5 (10%) males corresponding aged. We used the following methods: the EAS Temperament Survey (EASD) in addition for adults, EPQ Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Polish Abbreviated Form of the MMPI (DKO-74) and Beck's Depression Scale. We compared the scores of thyroid cancer patients and hyperthyroid patients.

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether patients with hyperthyreosis differ from healthy persons in their ability to oxidize sparteine and acetylate sulphadimidine as model drugs. Oxidation and acetylation were estimated in 48 patients with hiperthyreosis. The control group consisted of 160 healthy volunteers for comparison of oxidation phenotype and 60 healthy volunteers for comparison of acetylation phenotype. The phenotyping of oxidation revealed two distinct populations among 40 patients with hyperthyreosis: 38 persons (95%) were extensive metabolizers (EM) of sparteine and 2 persons (5%) was poor metabolizers (PM). In 160 healthy persons (91.2%) were EM and 14 persons (8.8%) were PM. The difference between frequency distribution of PM and EM in healthy persons and in patients with hyperthyreosis was not statistically significant. The phenotyping of acetylation showed among 48 patients with hyperthyreosis 8 persons (13%) were rapid acetylators (RA) and 40 persons (87%) were slow acetylators (SA). In 60 healthy volunteers the phenotype of rapid acetylation was observed in 31 persons (51%) and slow acetylation in 29 persons (49%). Relative risk (odds ratio) of development of thyroid diseases was 5.34 times higher for SA in comparison to RA. The prevalence of SA among patients with hyperthyreosis in comparison to healthy volunteers was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0002). The results of our study may suggest that slow acetylation phenotype is associated with increased risk of the development of hyperthyreosis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a determination of serum level of thyrotropin-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins (second generation TBII assay) in predicting the possibility of relapse in the early phase of pharmacological treatment. We investigated 37 patients within the 20-60 age range with the first occurrence of GH. All patients were treated with thiamazole for 12 months. Clinical assessment, ultrasound estimation of thyroid volume and determination of serum thyrotropin, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, thyroid autoantibodies and TBII levels were carried out at the onset and after 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of ATD treatment. The mean follow-up period after ATD withdrawal was 27.24 +\/- 5.81 months. Of 37 patients 12 (32%) had a relapse of hyperthyroidism (mean time 8.17 +\/- 6.91 months after drug withdrawal). The difference in TBII levels between the relapse and the remission group was found to be significant after the first month of therapy until the end of ATD treatment. We observed that patients with TBII above 14 IU\/L after 3 months and above 8 IU\/L after 6 months of therapy relapsed more frequently than patients with lower levels (sensitivity 50% and specificity 92 and 96%, respectively). The study confirmed that TBII estimation in the early phase of ATD could be useful in the proper planning of GH therapy and early qualification to more radical treatment (radioiodine or surgery).

Currently no standard treatment guidelines have been accepted. While treatment procedures have been established in specialized centres, management of complicated and long-lasting cases is always individual. We present an unusual case of Graves' ophthalmopathy accompanied by other autoimmune diseases. Our patient, MB, female, born in 1961, was diagnosed with Graves' disease 13 years ago. Recurrent hyperthyroidism and large goitre qualified her for strumectomy (performed twice) and long-term antithyroid treatment. Four years after her initial diagnosis, relapsing severe (ophthalmopathy index: 9 points, CAS: 7 points) occurred which persisted despite continuous administration of glucocorticoids. Due to imminent blindness, orbital decompression had to be performed, three times since. Concurrent autoimmune diseases: ulcerative colitis and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis were also stated. Two years ago, due to loss of vision acuity, rapid progression of exophthalmos and recurrence of hyperthyroidism, immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine was undertaken over a period of 12 months. The present condition of the patient is satisfactory. Judging from the discussed course of treatment, in rare and difficult cases of proliferative ophthalmopathy, early immunosuppressive treatment other than glucocorticoids, should be considered.

It encodes enzyme called glutathione S-transferase pi class, which is involved in the detoxification of a variety of potential carcinogenic compounds. Polymorphism in this gene can cause the amino acid substitution. This substitution, close to the substrate binding site, changes the enzymatic activity for particular substrates and subsequently increases the risk of carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the function of GSTP1 polymorphism in thyroid cancer and possible association between GSTP1 polymorphism and age at diagnosis. 103 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and 53 individuals from control group were examined using PCR-RFLP. Statistically insignificant association of studied polymorphisms with thyroid cancer was observed. Comparison of allele frequency between cases and control groups revealed the presence of risk alleles. For the first polymorphism Ile OR = 1.257; 95% CI [0.792-1.997] (p = 0.332), and for the second one Val OR = 1.283; 95% CI [0.6260-2.631] (p = 0.495). The presence of Val\/Val (c.313A&gt;G) led to a significant earlier age of onset as compared with other genotypes (p &lt; 0.05). Mean age at diagnosis for Val\/Val genotype was 41.1 +\/- 15.2, and for Ile\/Val + Ile\/Ile reached 48.9 +\/- 13.2. There was no association between age and genotype for c.341C&gt;T polymorphism. Statistically insignificant association of GSTP1 gene polymorphism with thyroid cancer was observed in studied group of patients. The Val\/Val genotype for c.313A&gt;G polymorphism led to earlier age of tumour diagnosis as compared with other genotypes. ","1206":"Transient and persistent hypoparathyroidism (HPT) belong to the well known complications of total thyroidectomy performed because of thyroid carcinoma. The true frequency of persistent hypoparathyroidism is often higher than estimated in the reports published by the specialized centers with low rate of complications. Investigation whether the repeated check-up, performed over 2 years post thyroidectomy, reveals some cases of recovery in patients diagnosed with persistent HPT post thyroid cancer surgery. In total, 115 patients were included into the study, all of them treated with vitamin D derivatives and calcium supplementation. In 17 of them a diagnosis of transient hypoparathyroidism was made on the basis of evaluation performed 6 months after surgery, the remaining 98 were diagnosed with persistent HPT. Parathyroid (PTH) function was reevaluated after withdrawal of active vitamin D derivatives for 10 days and of calcium carbonate for two days during the hospital stay in patients admitted for radioiodine scan, thus after thyroxine withdrawal. The control group consisted of 123 DTC (differentiated thyroid carcinoma) patients without parathyroid dysfunction. On the basis of intact PTH serum level and calcium and phosphorus estimations HPT was unequivocally confirmed in 49 patients (50%). The remaining 49 patients exhibited normal PTH level and in 43 (86%) of them Ca(2+) level was also within normal range, thus delayed, recovery from HPT was stated. Our results indicate that reevaluation of hypoparathyroidism post total thyreoidectomy is necessary, as delayed recover of parathyroid dysfunction is a frequent phenomenon. We also propose criteria of reevaluation of HTP in patients on chronic substitutive therapy.

The study group involved 43 obese women (aged 41.8 +\/- 11.9 years, weight 95.2 +\/- 15.0 kg, BMI 36.5 +\/- 4.6 kg\/m(2)). The women were subjected to three-month complex weight-loss treatment. Patients were advised to keep to a 1000-1200 kcal diet and to exercise regularly. Pharmacological treatment was not administered. Serum concentrations of nitric oxide metabolites, TNF-alpha and its soluble receptors (sTNFR1, sTNFR2) were measured by ELISA kits; insulin was measured by RIA and glucose, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglicerydes by an enzymatic procedure before and after weight loss. Body composition was determined by impedance analysis using Bodystat. The mean weight loss during treatment was 8.3 +\/- 4.3 kg. The serum concentrations of TNF-alpha decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.000) and both receptors sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 increased significantly (p &lt; 0.000) after weight loss. No significant changes in serum concentrations of NO were observed after weight loss. A multiple regression analysis was performed using DeltaTNF-alpha, DeltasTNFR1, DeltaTNFR2 and DeltaNO as dependent variables. A significant correlation was observed between DNO and initial plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2. This study demonstrates a decrease in serum TNF-alpha concentration as well as an increase in plasma concentration of both TNF receptors but does not show any change in serum concentrations of NO after weight-loss treatment in obese women. It seems that changes in TNF-system activity may be a counter-regulating mechanism, which inhibits further body mass loss. We did not observe any association between changes in TNF-system activity and serum concentrations of NO after weight loss. ","1209":"Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) is a cytokine with pleiotropic effects which, via different pathways, influences the secretion of certain cytokines and hormones. Growth hormone (GH) secreted from the pituitary has physiological effects on various target tissues. The question is how IFN-alpha administered in various types of disease influences GH secretion. This study investigated the acute effect of IFN-alpha on GH mRNA expression in the rat anterior pituitary. The aim of the study was to measure the cellular expression of GH mRNA by in situ hybridisation in the anterior pituitary after a single administration of IFN-alpha. Rats were administered an intraperitoneal injection of IFN-alpha or saline. The rat pituitaries were taken 2 and 4 hours after IFN\/saline administration and kept frozen until in situ hybridisation histochemistry. A 31-base(35)S-labelled oligonucleotide probe complementary to part of the exonic mRNA sequence coding for GH mRNA was used. All control and experimental sections were hybridised in the same hybridisation reaction. Acute administration of interferon alpha increased GH mRNA expression in the anterior pituitary in the 4-hour group in comparison with the control group, and there was no difference between the control group and the 2-hour rats. A single IFN-alpha administration was found to exert an influence on anterior pituitary GH mRNA expression. These observations may pave the way for presenting a possible new action of IFN-alpha. ","1210":"","1211":"Retinoic acid is a regulator of gene expression which, by binding to its nuclear receptor, determines the degree of differentiation in multiple cancer cell types. On the basis of this capability it was introduced, e.g. in the therapy of neuroblastoma. In cells derived from neural crest, such as neuroblastoma cells, retinoic acid initiates differentiation into neurons. This substance acts in a similar way on a rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. The aim of our work was to examine the influence of retinoic acid on the phenotype of human pheochromocytoma cells in primary culture. Observations were made on two primary cultures isolated from human pheochromocytoma. Cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum. Subsequently, the cultures were treated with 100 mMol retinoic acid for three-days. An evaluation of the phenotype change was performed by estimating the expression levels of F-actin, MAP-2 protein, and chromogranin, with the use of a confocal microscopy. The introduction of retinoic acid into the culture caused an increase in the F-actin level and its redistribution in the form of stress fibers. Simultaneously, the cells changed their shape, generating more processes. No change was detected in the expression level of neuroendocrine markers: MAP-2 and chromogranin. Retinoic acid appears to have an influence on some phenotype parameters of human pheochromocytoma cells. Further work is needed to determine the molecular mechanisms of this process, and to evaluate thoroughly the benefits of introducing retinoic acid into therapy of pheochromocytoma tumors.

Authors presents preliminary results of multicenter analysis concerning incidence, diagnostics and treatment of DTC in children. The study is a retrospective analysis of 107 pediatric patients from 14 academic centers based on the data from 2000 to 2005 obtained by questionnaire in hospitals involved in the treatment of DTC in children. Papillary thyroid cancer was diagnosed in 83 children, follicular thyroid cancer in 10 children and medullary thyroid cancer in 14 children. Incidence of DTC in children was estimated between 18 and 23 cases per year. The biggest group of patients consisted of children between 11 and 15 years of age, with girls to boys ratio 3.3 : 1. Clinically DTC in children presented most often as solitary thyroid nodule. Cervical lymphadenopathy was observed in 42% of patients. Intraoperative verification indicated metastatic nodes in 50% of children. Low stage DTC predominated (T1 in 36% and T2 in 26% of children). One step surgery was performed in 65% of children with DTC, two step surgery in 25% of patients. I131 therapy was undertaken in 80% of children. Lung metastases were indicated in post therapeutic studies in 14% of children with DTC. Prophylactic thyroidectomies were performed in 79% of children in the group of patients with MTC and RET gene mutations. The necessity of introduction of unified therapeutic standard in children with DTC in Poland is underlined. ","1213":"The introduction of the DICOM format in all diagnostic imaging devices allowed co-registering SPECT, CT, MR and other types of biomedical imaging. Fusion can be performed by dedicated hybrid devices or by means of software. The fusion algorithm consists of two steps: coregistration and simultaneous visualization. Our center gradually implemented SPECT-CT fusion in clinical diagnostic work-up of several endocrinologic and oncologic diseases more than 2 years ago. An easy and fast algorithm in terms of computational complexity of image fusion was presented and applied to 81 consecutive cases. Thirty-two patients were scheduled to SPECT-CT fusion after thyroidectomy and (131)I treatment for thyroid cancer, twelve after somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, seven after 131I MIBG therapy, six after diagnostic MIBG scintigraphy with (123)I or (131)I, three after parathyroid scintigraphy and two after bone scan. The most common indication to the fusion was the need of metabolic characterization of suspected lesions detected on CT scan. The anatomic localization of a focal uptake seen on SPECT and the evaluation of the radiometabolic therapy effect folloved. A variance of error level observed was a result of human factor, decision on marker's placement, respiratory movements and marker's displacement between acquisitions. However, 74% of patients in our series have fusion results classified as \"very good\" or \"good\". The selection of patients, the training of the personel and the cooperation with radiologists are the most important factors for a correct application and interpretation of the SPECT-CT image fusion.

Application of recombinant TSH is an alternative procedure which considerably increases cost of diagnostics but allows to avoid symptoms of hypothyreosis. This work was aimed at evaluating the influence of a withdrawal of L-T4 preparations preceding the control diagnostics on the quality of life in patients. Investigation was performed in a group of 131 patients [115 women (87.75%) and 16 men (12.25%)] with differentiated thyroid carcinoma admitted for a periodic control diagnostics that included neck ultrasonography and an evaluation of Tg concentration, wholebody scintigraphy following a stimulation of endogenous TSH after a one-month break in taking L-T4 preparations. Research was conducted with a prepared questionnaire assessing several basic determinants of the quality of life on a 6-degree scale. During hypothyreosis quality of life in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma is worsened. The frequency and volume of symptoms increased twice. 1. One-month gap in taking L-T4 is associated with a significant deterioration of the quality of life in tested patients. 2. The symptoms are especially strongly expressed in the elderly. 3.

Unexpectedly in patients in whom remission lasted &gt; 5 years, complete suppression was observed in 60%. However, this last group was less numerous, thus, the majority of no evidence of disease patients exhibited subcomplete TSH suppression, while only 40% of patients with active disease had this goal realized. 1.

The aim of the study was to examine the influence of levothyroxine on the proliferative activity of the thyroid follicular cells. Cytological material was obtained from 32 euthyroid females, aged 34-69 years, by USG-guided Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB), before and after 6 months treatment with levothyroxine. The patients were divided into 2 age groups: up to 45 years (14 patients) and above 45 years (18 females). Proliferative activity of the follicular cells was assessed by the proliferative index (PI), representing the percentage of follicular cells with positive reaction with the antibody Ki-67. Microscopic evaluation was carried out using morphometric computer system MicroImage InCD UDF (Olympus). After 6-months of treatment IP values decreased significantly in both groups studied (8.59 +\/- 3.07 vs 6.51 +\/- +\/- 1.91; p &lt; 0.001 in females aged &lt; 45 years and 7.72 +\/- 1.83 vs 5.09 +\/- 1.51; p &lt; 0.001 in the older group).

The studied group consisted of 58 patients, 24 with papillary thyroid carcinomas, 19 with nodular goiters and 15 with follicular adenomas. Control group included 180 healthy volunteers. Four different SNP polymorphisms were analysed in PCR products using the SNaPshot test, on genetic analyser ABI Prism 310; these can be found in NCBI database under rs numbers: 1803938 (a\/g), 11024 (g\/c), 1801463 (a\/c) and 1131516 (c\/t).

In the thyroid gland, the high expression of this protein has been described in differentiated carcinomas, especially in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Analysis of Gal-3 protein expression in PTC and nodular goiters; investigation of Gal-3 mRNA expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in patients with PTC and nodular goiter; analysis of correlation between Gal-3 protein expression in PTC and Gal-3 mRNA in PBL of the same patient. Gal-3 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in benign (27 multinodular goiters) and malignant (30 papillary carcinomas) thyroid tissues and galectin-3 mRNA expression by real-time PCR in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 90 patients with multinodular goiter (n = 27), papillary carcinoma (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 33). In PTC we observed increased expression of Gal-3 protein (all 30 cases) in cytoplasm, nucleus and cell membranes of cancer cells. 23 of 27 benign thyroid nodular goiters were negative for Gal-3 expression. In all examined blood samples we observed higher LGALS3BP gene expression than GAPDH (house keeping gene) with no difference between both groups, without relation to the Gal-3 expression in PTC.

","1219":"Studies of gene expression profile using DNA microarray technology are usually performed using either tumor-derived sample material or isolated neoplastic cells obtained through microdissection. The scope of information about neoplastic transformation gained from studying profile of gene expression in microdissected samples would be much wider but collection of sufficient amounts of intact RNA is very difficult. A compromise could be reached by relating gene expression profile to percentage of neoplastic cells in the investigated tissue sample. The ratio of neoplastic cells in the investigated sample of papillary thyroid cancer was assessed through evaluation of approximated count of cell number in 10-18 examined image fields. This information was related to gene expression profiles obtained from DNA microarrays. The study involved 40 cases of papillary thyroid cancer; the percentage of PTC cells varied between 20 and 95% and only in half of the cases exceeded 75%. Correct differentiation of tumor and normal sample by means of gene expression profile was possible only when the percentage of tumor cells exceeded 25-30%. Seventeen genes showing the best correlation with the tumor cell numbers were selected and their classification potential was evaluated. Strength of information derived from gene expression profile studies by DNA microarrays in papillary thyroid cancer cells is very reliable and permits distinguishing correctly between normal and neoplastic tissues even when the percentage of cancer cells does not exceed 25-50%. However, the differentiation potential of gene expression profile is not markedly improved by selection of genes showing best correlation with the number of tumor cells.","1220":"The studies of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) gene expression profile have shown changes in expression of genes involved in transport of several ions. The aim of our study was a real-time PCR evaluation of three of them: KCNJ2, SLC4A4 and SLC34A2. The analysis was carried out in PTC tumors and normal thyroid samples gained from 38 patients. Real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was performed (Taqman) with beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as the reference gene. We observed 20 x increase of SLC34A2 expression in PTC. This gene encodes Na+\/PO(4) (3-) cotransporter. Considerable increase of gene expression has been shown also for KCNJ2, encoding a potassium ion channel. SLC4A4, which encodes the Na+\/HCO(3) (2-) cotransporter, exhibited a 7-fold decrease in PTC. The performed study revealed that SLC34A2 gene exhibited the most distinct change in expression and may become a molecular marker of papillary thyroid cancer.

The aim of our study was to compare by means of real-time Q-PCR expression levels of chosen genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with respect to normal thyroid tissues. Total RNA was isolated from 38 paired normal and PTC samples. 0.5 mug of RNA was used in the reverse transcription reaction. cDNA was further used in Q-PCR reaction. As endogenous control we used GUS gene, as its expression was stable in all analysed samples. The analyzed genes were found by microarray studies as characteristic in differentiated papillary carcinoma and normal tissue. The levels of gene expression, estimated by quantitative analysis of particular transcripts were increased in papillary thyroid carcinoma with the following average values: 0.76 for MMP11; 1.08 for CLDN1; 3.98 for LRP4; 4.57 for FLRT3; 26.6 for MRC2; 2.76 for NRCAM; and 1.35 for EVA1 (arbitrary units), whereas in normal thyroid tissues treated as control the respective values were: 0.09; 0.145; 0.7; 0.74; 7.9; 0.85 and 0.396 units. To confirm the overexpression of mentioned genes the conservative Kolmogorov- Smirnov test was used. Differences in expression between normal thyroid tissue and PTC were statistically significant. Among the analyzed genes two show the largest difference in expression between papillary thyroid cancer and normal tissue: MMP11 (metalloproteinase 11) and CLDN1 (claudin 1). The MMP11 gene can be characteristic for various malignant thyroid carcinomas, because its increased levels are present also in medullary thyroid carcinomas. It appears that claudin 1 may be used as a marker of PTC, however a verification on independent collection of tumors of this result is required. ","1222":"DPP4 gene (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) is expressed in epithelial cells of many organs and cells of immune system. There is no expression of DPP4 in normal healthy thyroid, while it is highly expressed in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), as shown by gene expression profiling. In this study we validated expression of DPP4 in papillary thyroid cancer and normal thyroid tissue and evaluated its usefulness for diagnostic purposes. The analysis was carried out on total RNA extracted from 102 PTCs and 77 normal thyroid fragments with use of Q-PCR reaction. Beta-glucuronidase was the reference gene. We confirmed the distinct increase of DPP4 expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma. However, the ROC (relative operating characteristic) analysis revealed that the diagnostic efficiency of DPP4 estimation is limited. DPP4 is increased in papillary thyroid cancer, however, its diagnostic usefulness as a single PTC marker is doubtful.

In about 10% of cases cytopathologic features do not differentiate unequivocally benign and malignant lesions. In these cases the cytopathologic diagnosis of follicular tumor (FT) or oxyphilic tumor (OT) is most often made. From 2001 to 2002 in our Department of Pathology the cytopathologic diagnosis of FT and OT was made in 102 and 25 cases respectively. Histopathologic verification was possible in 39 (38%) patients with FT and in 19 (76%) patients with OT. Histopathological diagnosis of neoplasm was made in 48.7% (19\/39) FT and 42% (8\/19) OT. The risk of carcinoma was 12.8% in FT and 16% in OT group (surgical treated cases only). These results show how difficult the diagnostics of follicular lesions in FNAB could be because of the frequent overlapping of the cytological features of benign and malignant lesions. Diagnosis of follicular tumor does not mean carcinoma. Majority lesions are begin non neoplastic on final histopathologic examination. The use of follicular\/ oxyphilic tumor in cytological diagnostic instead of follicular neoplasm seems more advisable. However FNAB in the correlation with clinical data may select the patients for the surgical treatment or the further observation. ","1224":null,"1225":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is usually more advanced at presentation than differentiated thyroid cancers and often has distant metastases. The primary treatment of MTC is total thyroidectomy and regional lymph node dissection. The efficacy of these procedures has been limited by the aggressiveness of the disease and metastatic spread at the time of surgery. Persistently elevated levels of calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or their increase postoperatively are indicative for residual or recurrent disease. Conventional imaging methods such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and MIBI scintigraphy usually fail to find the source of calcitonin. Better imaging properties have been shown by DMSA scintigraphy, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy or by positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PET for the localisation of occult MTC in patients after surgery with increased concentrations of CT, in whom conventional imaging procedures have not been successful. The PET investigation using (18)F-fluoro- 2-deoxy-D-glucose combined with computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET\/CT) was performed at the Department of Nuclear Medicine (Oncology Centre in Bydgoszcz) between January and October 2004. In five patients with postoperative calcitonin ranging from 164 to &gt; 2000 ng\/l (normal &lt; 10 ng\/l) no tumour lesions were found using other imaging methods. In four of five cases, responsible lesions with a higher metabolism of FDG, indicating MTC tissue (remnants or metastases), were localised. In one patient no focus of FDG accumulation was found despite high CT concentration. PET detected tumour manifestations in the neck and the mediastinum in two patients, in the lung and the left adrenal gland in one case and in the neck and the liver in another patient. As a result of surgery for the removal of a residual tumour or metastases the accuracy of diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology in all four cases and a decrease in CT and CEA levels was observed in 3\/4 cases. The metabolic imaging findings by PET\/CT ensured that the surgery on these patients was successful. For the detection of occult residual or metastatic MTC lesions, (18)FDG-PET is a valuable procedure in imaging diagnostics. ","1226":"Traditionally, for diagnostic and therapeutic application of radioiodine in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), a 4 to 6 week withdrawal of thyroid hormone was applied. Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) was developed to provide TSH stimulation without withdrawal of thyroid hormone and associated morbidity. The results of rhTSH administration and endogenous TSH stimulation are equivalent in detecting recurrent DTC. At the present time rhTSH is approved as an adjunct for diagnostic procedures and thyroid ablation in patients with DTC. In addition, rhTSH has potential for use in facilitating the treatment of metastases in patients with DTC. In this review we have summarized our own experiences with rhTSH aided radioiodine therapy in patients with disseminated thyroid cancer. Generally, rhTSH was very well tolerated and treatment results were comparable to those achieved with thyroid hormone withdrawal.","1227":"Among genetic alterations most important for the initiation of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is mutation T1799A in the BRAF gene which is the most frequent event (54.5%) in this type of thyroid cancer. It is seen in all stages, from microcarcinoma through clinically overt disease to anaplastic cancer. It has been shown that BRAF mutation is correlated with PTC histotype. It is identified most frequently in classical PTC and in tall cell variant. Moreover, BRAF mutation is described more often in older patients, whereas in young patients RET\/PTC rearrangements dominate. In PTC cases with BRAF mutation V600E the prognosis is poorer, with more cancer invasiveness, metastasis and recurrence. The presence of BRAF mutation is related to the specific gene expression signature, different than in cancer cases showing RET\/PTC rearrangement or no known initiating mutation.","1228":"Recently a new somatostatin analogue labelled with (99m)Tc ((99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC) has been synthetized. Aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC in the radionuclide imaging in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). 30 patients with MTC aged 22-83 years in different stages of the disease were investigated. In 6 patients (group 1) scintigraphy was performed before surgery directly after diagnosis of MTC. Four patients (group 2) were qualified to the study in the phase of remission after surgical treatment that had been confirmed by low concentrations of calcitonin. Twenty patients (group 3) were investigated due to stagnation or recurrence confirmed by persistent hypercalcitoninemia. The scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC (Tektrotyd, POLATOM) was performed 2 and 4 hours post injection of 20 mCi (740 MBq) of the tracer. Other imaging techniques were also employed and analysed in individual cases (US, CT, (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA, (131)I-MIBG, (99m)Tc-MDP, (111)In-octreotide and FDG-PET). Images obtained 2 and 4 hours p.i. were similar. In group 1, uptake of the tracer was found in the primary tumour of MTC in all patients. In group 2, a false positive result was found in 1 of 6 patients. In the remaining 5 of 6 cases no pathological foci were visualised. In group 3, uptake in the thyroid bed was found in 3 of 20 cases and in the lymph nodes in 14 of 20 patients. In 3 of 20 cases uptake in the bone metastases was found. Globally, sensitivity of the scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC was 86.4%, specificity - 75.0%, and accuracy - 84.6%. The scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC showed high utility in the diagnosis of MTC.

","1229":"Medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) reveal overexpression of several peptide receptors particularly of gastrin and cholecystokinin 2 (CCK2). Experimental studies of various CCK-2\/gastrin analogues found that a C-terminal, 8-aminoacid peptide, (D)Glu-octagastrin, has optimal properties. Thus, the aim of our studies was to prepare (99m)Tc-labelled HYNIC-octagastrin, to evaluate its biologic tolerance in animals and introduce for scintigraphy in patients with MTC. HYNIC-(D)Glu-octagastrin was from piCHEM (Graz, Austria), (99m)Tc generator from Amersham (Health), other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Labelling of the peptide was performed in phosphate buffer of pH 6.0 for 10 minutes at 100(o)C using EDDA and tricine as coligands. The labeling yields were high (above 95%); the specific activity amounted to 1200 to 1430 microCi\/microg. Radiochemical purity on SepPak cartridge and ITLC ranged from 94 to 98%. No adverse effects were observed in mice after administration of 10 to 50 times greater doses that those used in patients. Clinical studies comprised 20 patients with MTC and high serum calcitonin. (99m)Tc-EDDA\/HYNIC-(D)Glu-octagastrin, 500 to 700 MBq, was administered iv and whole body scintigraphy was performed using a double head gamma-camera (Varicam, Elscint) 2 and 4 hours later. Increased accumulation of the tracer in foci of MTC and its metastases was found in 8 patients. Scintigraphy with a new gastrin analogue ((D)Glu-octagastrin) makes it possible to detect MTC with overexpression of CCK-2\/gastrin receptors and to select patients for receptor-mediated radiopeptide therapy using DOTA-gastrin analogues labelled with (177)Lu and (90)Y. ","1230":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma occurs both as a sporadic and a familial disease. Inherited MTC (iMTC) patients usually exhibit better prognosis than patients with sporadic form of MTC (sMTC), however, in both subtypes the outcome is unpredictable. No molecular markers contributing to the prognosis or predicting the type of therapy have been introduced to clinical practice until now. The aim of this study was to analyze gene expression pattern of MTC by high density oligonucleotide microarray. 24 samples were studied: 12 MTC and 12 corresponding normal tissues, (Affymetrix HG-U 133A). Among MTC patients there were half inherited cases and half sporadic ones. First, the differences between MTC and thyroid tissue were analyzed by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which indicated three main modes determining the variability of gene expression profile: the first two were related to the tumor\/normal tissue difference and the third one was related to the immune response. The characteristic expression pattern, beside of numerous changes within cancer- related genes, included many up-regulated genes specific for thyroid C cells. Further analysis of the second component revealed two subgroups of MTC, but the subdivision was not related to the iMTC\/sMTC difference. Recursive Feature Replacement (RFR) confirmed the very similar expression profile in both forms of MTC. With subsequent ANOVA analysis some genes with differential expression could be specified, among them monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABRR1) which were consistently up-regulated in sMTC. In contrary, some genes involved in regulation of cell proliferation: opioid growth factor receptor(OGFR) and synaptotagmin V (SYT 5) were up-regulated in iMTC. The obtained data indicate a very similar gene expression pattern in inherited and sporadic MTC. Minor differences in their molecular profile require further analysis. ","1231":"The aim of this study was to analyse the distribution and frequency of mutations and their correlations with clinical phenotypes of patients with MTC, to reveal the differences between sporadic and familial type of MTC, and to describe the phenotypes of patients. 212 patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) were treated in Cancer Centre in Warsaw between 1997 and 2005. In most patients, DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes was tested for RET gene mutations by sequencing and accordingly MTC form was assessed. Genetic testing was performed in the relatives of patients with familial MTC in order to distinguish asymptomatic mutation carriers from noncarriers. RET gene mutations were identified in 46 patients (22%). The others were found noncarriers and sporadic MTC was diagnosed. MEN 2A\/FMTC syndrome (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A\/ familial type of MTC) was diagnosed in 44 patients, MEN 2B syndrome (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B) in 2 patients. In patients with sporadic and familial MTC, age at diagnosis and multifocal occurrence was analysed, and the results were found to be in accordance with those of other research centres. However, the distribution and frequency of mutations, as well as some clinical data, such as the frequency of pheochromocytoma occurrence as the first manifestation of MEN syndrome, differed from the published data, and further studies are necessary to reveal the reasons of these differences. DNA testing for RET gene mutations is reliable as a diagnostic tool and therefore it should be performed for screening of all patients with MTC or other diseases of MEN syndrome. ","1232":"The assessment of frequency and type of mutation and differences in prognosis between sporadic and hereditary type of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), based on own DNA analysis, was performed. The group of 190 persons with hereditary MTC or asymptomatic mutation carriers was analyzed. Patients with sporadic MTC without RET gene mutation were included into control group (708 persons). The recognition of MTC type was based on assessment of family history, physical examination and genetic analysis. The family history consisted of information about MTC, pheochromocytoma and other neoplasms and hyperparathyroidism in relatives. The mutations located in codon 634 of exon 11 were the most often (43% of all mutations and 49% of mutations in syndrome MEN 2A\/FMTC). The age of diagnosis was ranged between 7 and 71 years (mean age: 39 +\/- 15.2 years, median age: 41 years). In hereditary MTC the mean age of diagnosis was 27 +\/- 13.9 years and was significantly lower than in sporadic one, where it was 45.7 +\/- 14.3 years. The relationship between diagnosis, age and subtypes of hereditary MTC was assessed--no significant differences in examined subgroups were observed. The mean age of diagnosis in MEN 2A\/FMTC and MEN 2A syndrome was 28-29 years, in MEN 2B - 21 years. The overall survival in sporadic MTC after 5 years was 97%, in hereditary MTC - 79%. Analysis performed after excluding suprarenal causes of death revealed no statistically significant differences in overall survival between both subtypes of MTC. 1. Hereditary MTC is still diagnosed too late, besides of DNA analysis. 2. In hereditary and sporadic MTC the prognosis is comparable. ","1233":"The loss of iodine uptake by differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) cells is a major therapeutic problem especially in patients with nonsurgical metastatic foci or local recurrence. Using 13-cis-retinoic acid, it was attempted to retain iodine uptake as a result of redifferentiation (influence by retinoic acid receptors present in DTC cells). Between 1999 and 2005, 13-cis-retinoic acid was used in 11 patients with disseminated PTC and high serum level of thyroglobulin (Tg) before (131)I treatment (2 patients were treated twice - 13 treatment cycles in total). Side effects in skin and mucous membranes were observed in all the patients, however, their intensity did not require termination of the therapy. Increase of iodine uptake was observed in 5 patients (45%). Decreased Tg concentration was observed in 9 patients. In that group, increased (131)I uptake was observed in 4 patients with distant metastases. All determinations of Tg concentrations were carried out under TSH stimulation. 13-cis-retinoic acid causes an increase of radioiodine uptake in around half of treated patients, however, the follow-up of these patients indicates that this increase does not result in either full remission or even stabilisation of neoplastic disease. The possibility should be considered to use cis-retinoic acid as an independent therapeutic approach in patients with radioiodine non-avid foci of thyroid carcinoma especially those showing high expression of RARb and RXRg receptors. ","1234":"In differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) the differentiation between reactive and metastatic lymph nodes is difficult at the early stages of metastasis. The aim of the study was to assess the results of fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples examination by the use of RT-PCR for Tg mRNA. The special attention was directed to the evaluation of specificity of TgRNA estimation. The group consisted of 193 DTC patients with suspicion of lymph node recurrence and at least one positive RT-PCR result. Thyroglobulin RT-PCR was conducted in residual material left after preparation of cytological smears from FNA specimens. Primer spanning exons 3-5 were used with 39 cycles of PCR. RNA isolation control and cDNA amplification were carried out using GAPDH starters. 308 lymph node biopsies were included. 246 positive results for Tg RNA were observed in the analyzed group, 71.1% confirmed by FNA. Among other 71 results, in which cytological examination did not correspond unequivocally to molecular findings, in 34 metastases were confirmed both by cytological and clinical examination. There were 11 patients operated due to the positive serial molecular examination only. In 10 (91%) of them DTC metastases were confirmed. So, the positive predictive value of the molecular result ranged between 75-89% and the negative one was 100%. In DTC patients RT-PCR Tg mRNA is helpful in qualification of suspicious lymph nodes to surgery in DTC patients. At the negative cytological finding, the positive molecular result constitutes an indication for early surgery. ","1235":"Recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer generally occurs first in the neck. Ultrasound is sensitive in detecting enlarged cervical lymph nodes but is not specific enough. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy increases the specificity but still may fail to detect a recurrence of the disease in the cystic metastatic lymph nodes. The aim of the study was to estimate the value of Tg concentration in the needle washout after fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes. The 105 patients studied had presented one or more enlarged suspicious cervical lymph nodes. All had undergone total thyroidectomy and (131)I ablative therapy. Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration was within the 0.15-711.5 ng\/ml range (mean 22.24 ng\/ml) and Tg recovery range 94-100%. The positive Tg washout concentration cut-off value was established as equal to the mean plus two standard deviations of the Tg washout concentration of patients with negative cytology. Lymph node involvement was diagnosed by cytology in 15 patients and in 28 lymph nodes. Positive Tg washout concentration was found in 22 patients and in 48 lymph nodes. All the lymph nodes which turned out to have positive cytology had a positive Tg washout concentration. All lymph nodes with positive cytology were positive in pathology. Seven patients and 20 lymph nodes with negative cytology were positive in the Tg washout concentration test. All but one patients and all but two lymph nodes with a positive Tg washout concentration had positive pathology. 1. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy is not sensitive enough to detect all metastatic lymph nodes. 2. The Tg washout concentration test is 100% sensitive in the detection of metastatic lymph nodes. 3. Cytology in ultrasound- guided fine-needle biopsy is 100% specific. 4. The Tg washout concentration test carries a risk of false-positive results. 5. Both methods should be used for early detection of metastatic lymph nodes in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. ","1236":"The low incidence of relapse in differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), primarily treated by total thyroidectomy and (131)I ablation, stimulates the search for optimal follow-up algorithms which do not include too many tests but are not connected with a risk of missing early recurrence. The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of the routine follow up examinations for early detection of DTC recurrence in low risk DTC patients. The group consisted of 617 DTC patients diagnosed in 1995-1996. In 513 (83%) total thyroidectomy was performed. 449 (73%) received ablative (131)I therapy. After primary approach complete remission (CR) was stated in 453 (73%), persistent disease in 116 (19%), asymptomatic hyperthyroglobulinaemia in 14 (2%). Patients with CR constituted the low risk group analyzed in this study. The median follow up was 4.16 yrs. Recurrent disease appeared in 28 (6%) patients (23 locoregional, 9 distant metastases, both in 4). Serum Tg (thyroglobulin) level at the moment of relapse diagnosis was detectable in 44% while neck sonography was the first examination to detect recurrence in 56% of cases. In the selected group of DTC patients treated by radical primary approach and showing a low risk of recurrence only half of all relapse cases are diagnosed by the rise of serum Tg level. Regular sonography contributes to the second half of diagnoses. Thus, a special weight should be put on neck sonography as the important element of regular follow up in low risk DTC patients. ","1237":"Since the effect of pre-therapeutic scintigraphy on the outcome of DTC treatment is debated, we evaluated factors affecting the effectiveness of (131)I therapy with respect to the delay between diagnostic scintigraphy and the application of radioiodine. In the studied group of 60 patients with DTC, mean age 54.6 +\/- 13.0 years, four weeks prior to the planned diagnostics, L-thyroxine was withdrawn and the following tests performed: (131)I (4 MBq) uptake above the neck, thyroid volume by USG, TSH and hTg level. Wholebody scintigraphy (37 MBq) was performed. The time between this diagnostic scintigraphy and application of (131)I (3657 MBq) was calculated. Based on whole-body 131I scintigraphy (74 MBq) performed 1 year after radioiodine treatment, the patients were divided into: group I - 42 patients with no tracer accumulation, and group II--18 patients who continued to accumulate (131)I in the neck. The differences between the median values of (131)I uptake and of thyroid volumes, and between the TSH and hTg median values in the two groups of patients were found not to be statistically significant. The average times between diagnostic scintigraphy and (131)I treatment in group I and II (9.4 vs. 8.3 weeks, respectively) were not significantly different either. Despite the different effectiveness of supplementary (131)I treatment, patients in group I and group II showed no statistically significant differences in the studied parameters. It appears that the diagnostic (131)I activity of 37 MBq and the time between diagnostic scintigraphy and application of (131)I did not have any effect on the results of the treatment in our group of patients. ","1238":"The aim of this study was to compare the early outcomes between two groups of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) who received 60 or 100 mCi of (131)I for remnant ablation. 224 DTC patients with primary tumor &gt; 1 cm of diameter or multifocal were randomised into prospective clinical trial. Patients with extrathyroideal extension of primary tumor and nodal metastases or M1 were not enrolled. 99 patients received 60 mCi, and 125--100 mCi of radioiodine as the first ablative dose. The effectiveness of thyroid ablation was evaluated after one year, during endogenous TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) stimulation, and after two years during Lthyroxine therapy. Whole body scintigraphy (WBS) was performed under thyroxine withdrawal and thyroglobulin serum level was assessed. Distant micrometastases were detected in 9.8% of patients by post-therapy WBS, 11 patients in group A treated with 60 mCi and 11 in group B treated with 100 mCi. In other patients no symptoms of persistent disease were detected. At one year follow up full remission was diagnosed in 176 patients: 76 in group A and 100 in group B. The remaining ones, 13.3% and 11.2% respectively, received the second course of (131)I for remnant ablation. There were no statistically significant differences in Tg (thyroglobulin) serum level either 12 or 24 months after 131I treatment. Our evaluation of early efficacy of adjuvant radioiodine treatment in low risk DTC patients shows no differences between two radioiodine activities - 60 and 100 mCi in relation to thyroid ablation. Thus, the activity of 60 mCi is recommended. ","1239":"Evaluation of the differential value of the first thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration, measured after thyroidectomy (Tx) but before thyroid remnant ablation, in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) as a marker of either metastases or residual cancer (M). Data from 517 patients with DTC after Tx, with follow-up &gt; 1.5 year were analysed retrospectively. Patients in whom either the course of the disease was unclear or interference in the Tg test was possible (a-TgAb [+], Tg recovery &lt; 80%) were excluded from the study. Finally, the data from 247 patients were evaluated (age: 14-79 years; 223 women, 24 men). The results of TSH, thyroid radioiodine uptake (T(up24)), thyroid remnant volume (V) and Tg in patients with diagnosed M (group M1; n = 35) were compared with the same parameters in patients with remission &gt; 1.5 year (group M0; n = 212). The area under the ROC curve was calculated. The clinical decision limit of Tg level to be suggestive of metastases was determined by means of efficiency curve. Groups M0 and M1 did not differ from each other with respect to TSH concentration (median 49.7 mIU\/l vs 44.3; p = 0.16) or thyroid remnant volume (1.4 vs 1.1 ml; p = 0.79). However, they did differ with respect to T(up24) (7.6 vs 3.2%; p = 0.01) and Tg (4.5 vs 96.7 ng\/ml; p = 0.000000). Area under ROC for Tg was 0.78 +\/- 0.05 (mean +\/- s.e.m.). The decision limit of Tg for suspected M was determined at 38.1 ng\/ml, Tg sensitivity was 0.57 (95%CI 0.39-0.74) and specificity 0.96 (95%CI 0.92-0.98). First thyroglobulin concentration, determined after thyroidectomy but before other treatment, is higher in patients with metastatic DTC than in patients without such metastases. This indicates that Tg level may be used as an early marker of either residual or metastatic DTC (even if thyroid remnants are present). ","1240":"Evaluation of the therapeutic benefits in relation to the stage of thyroid cancer and to the extent of surgery and the risk of postoperative complications. Retrospective analysis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) patients staged T1M0 versus T2-T4M0 was performed. All of them were treated or diagnosed in Institute of Oncology in Gliwice between 1986-1998. Previously they were operated in various surgical centers all-over Poland. The risk of death, local relapse and postoperative complications were analyzed using the decisiontree model to evaluate the therapeutic benefits. The recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (transient or permanent) was observed in retrospective analysis in 21% of patients, while postoperative hyperparathyroidism in 15.8%. The analysis of the therapeutic benefit index showed no advantage of total thyroidectomy in the T1M0 group (0.96 vs. 0.98 in patients treated by less than total thyroidectomy). The advantage of radical surgery was confirmed in T2-T4M0 group. The therapeutic benefit index was 0.92 in patients treated by total thyroidectomy and 0.69 in those who received less extensive operation. The analysis of therapeutic benefits confirmed the limit of 1 cm tumor diameter between less extensive surgery and total thyroidectomy. It showed that total thyroidectomy brings a significant therapeutic benefits in patients in &gt; T1M0 stage. The improvement of overall survival and decrease of local relapse far outweigh the disadvantages related to postoperative complications. ","1241":"The optimal surgical treatment of children with differentiated thyroid cancer remains an important point of discussion. Especially the need for completion operation is questioned in young patients. Our objective was to examine the rate of residual neoplastic disease after non radical initial operation. From the 235 children diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer, 131 (56%) needed completion operation due to incomplete primary surgery. Completion operation involved thyroid bed, lymph nodes or both respectively in 91 (39%), 13 (6%) and 27 (11%) cases. Risk factors responsible for residual disease were evaluated by means of logistic regression analysis. Residual disease was detected in 46 (35%) of reoperated children (25% in thyroid bed and 85% in lymph node of lateral neck compartment). Sex and age did not influence the risk of residual disease in thyroid bed or lymph nodes. Papillary type of cancer and multifocality increased risk of residual disease in thyroid bed respectively by the factor of 15 (95% CI: 2-125) and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.2-4.4). Infiltration of thyroid capsule did not correlate with the risk of residual disease. Lymph node metastases in primary operation increased risk of residual disease by the factor of 16 (95% CI: 1.2-245). Histopathology, multifocality of primary tumour or infiltration of lymph node capsule did not influence the risk of residual disease in lymph nodes of lateral neck compartment. In children with differentiated thyroid cancer residual disease is diagnosed in about 1\/3 of non radically operated cases. This high incidence justifies completion operations. The risk of residual disease is significantly increased in papillary thyroid cancer, multifocal tumours and cases with lymph node metastases. ","1242":"To analyze the impact of time and extent of operation on overall and disease-free survival in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Retrospective analysis of 1235 DTC patients, a representative probe of patients diagnosed or treated between 1986 to 1998 was performed. 277 patients were staged T1M0 and 958 ones staged &gt; T1M0. 10-year outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional-hazard model. The T1M0 patients were characterized by the best overall and disease-free survival independently of the time and the extent of operation (98% and 96% respectively); in &gt; T1M0 group the survival was better in patients who were treated by total thyroidectomy (94% and 68% respectively) than in patients treated by non-total thyroidectomy (78% and 47% respectively). In patients treated by completion of total thyroidectomy delayed more than 1 year post cancer diagnosis the incidence of carcinoma in postoperative pathological material was twice as high in comparison to the group in whom total thyroidectomy was performed within the first year of therapy (p = 0.000). 1. In differentiated thyroid carcinoma the prognosis is related to the extent of operation only in patients staged more than T1M0. 2. A delay &gt; 12 months in completion surgery in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (tumors &gt; 1 cm of diameter) significantly increases the risk of progression of multifocal disease in thyroid remnants. ","1243":"The aim of this study was both, to evaluate the usefulness of the method of neuromonitoring in intraoperative identification of the RLN and to estimate its value in the prognosis of postoperative RLN function in patients operated for TC. Among 109 patients undergoing surgery for TC between 12\/2004 and 12\/2005 the neuromonitoring method was used in 69 (63.3%) individuals (including 5 operations of completion total thyroidectomy). A Neurosign 100 equipment with laryngeal electrodes was employed in identification and assessment of total number of 134 RLN. Intraoperative results were compared to the postoperative results of the ENT-specialist examination of vocal cords mobility in indirect laryngoscopy, in each patient. Transient vs. permanent, unilateral RLN palsy was noted in 3 vs. 2 patients (2.2% vs. 1.4% of nerves at risk). The method of neuromonitoring facilitated identification of 123 (91.8%) RLN being not helpful in 11 (8.2%) cases. However, neuromonitoring was helpful in identification of the RLN, the value of the method in prognosis of posteoperative function of the RLN was limited. Results of indirect neurostimulation were more accurate than direct neurostimulation and were more accurate in prognosis of late rather than early RLN function after surgery (sensitivity 98.3%; specificity 100%; positive predictive value 100%; negative predictive value 50%, accuracy 98.4%). Application of intraoperative neuromonitoring facilitates identification of the RLN during surgery for TC. However, the method is of limited value in prognosis of postoperative RLN dysfunction in cases of missing signal after nerve stimulation. ","1244":"In the front of the problems related to the differentiation between benign and malignant thyroid tumors we decided to perform a multicentre study in order to validate diagnoses of malignant thyroid tumors and assess the inter-observer variability. Material included 690 cases of malignant and benign thyroid lesions with primary histopathology established in 1985-1999. These cases were selected to multicentre study. The studies were sent from centres which agreed to participate in the project and than coded in the independent centre--Department of Nuclear Medicine and Endocrine Oncology. 40 pathologists from 25 centres provided their diagnoses which were compared with the reference ones. 10 547 diagnoses were evaluated, both on their accuracy of the distinction between malignant and benign lesions and on their accuracy of cancer histotype definition. The reference diagnosis was made by an agreement between four expert pathologists (D.L., S.S., J.S. and A.K.). The participants diagnosed 21% of cases differently than experts. Concerning the diagnosis of cancer histotype, the difference between participants diagnosis and the reference one was even higher. The best concordance was achieved in the diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer, however, on the cost of cancer overdiagnosis by some participants. Follicular cancer was diagnosed accurately only in 75.4% of cases. The study documents a high inter-observer variability of thyroid cancer diagnosis and confirms the lesser accuracy of diagnosis of follicular cancer. ","1245":"The aim of the study was to determine the expression of selected adhesive molecules in papillary thyroid carcinoma. 47 papillary thyroid carcinoma cases and 11 nonmalignant goiter cases were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Galectin-3 (LGAL3) was a sensitive and specific marker, present in 91% of analyzed tumors and only in 5% of tumor margin. The presence of CA50 was 86% and 3% respectively with only 3% positive non-malignant cases. Cadherin E expression was noted in 91% of primary tumors, in 84% of the surrounding tissue and in 63% of non-malignant goiter. CD44 (DF1485) was observed in 89% of primary tumors and 48% of surrounding tissue; the reaction with BBA10 was more characteristic for metastases. Our study confirms the high diagnostic value of galectin-3 in papillary thyroid carcinoma and reveals the similar efficiency of CA50. CD44 (DF1485) expression in primary tumor is more intensive than in surrounding tissue, but the diagnostical inportance is not high because it is often observed in benign lesions. Using of BBA10 is more sensitive, but less specific. High expression of cadherin E in benign lesions impairs its diagnostical application in papillary thyroid cancer. ","1246":"Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is the best described mode of physiological cell death. During embryonal development and morphogenesis, apoptosis may be induced by two pathways. The first is external protein signal originating from other cell--also named as \"death signal\". Another one is specific cell reaction for external stress factors. Blood concentration of proteins regulating both pathways of apoptosis may be useful in early diagnosis and staging of thyroid tumors. The aim of study was evaluation of p53 and sFasL blood concentration in patients with benign follicular adenoma and follicular thyroid cancer. The study population was composed of 28 patients: 14 with thyroid carcinoma and 14 patients with follicular neoplasm (NF). All patients underwent surgical treatment. P53 and sFasL levels were evaluated before surgery and related to the histopathological diagnosis obtained post-surgery. The analysis revealed high sFasL blood concentration in patients with follicular thyroid cancer in comparison with the group with follicular adenoma. There was no statistically significant difference between levels of p53 in both groups. Evaluation of sFasL serum level concentration may be useful in preoperative diagnosis of follicular thyroid tumors. ","1247":"Estimation of malignancy in thyroid follicular neoplasms is a common diagnostic problem, thus revealing of differences in expression of some antigens in both benign and malignant lesions seems to be essential. The aim of this study is to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of CD15, galectin-3 and HBME-1 in follicular adenomas and carcinomas. Samples of 38 follicular adenomas (23 \"classical\", 5 with intracapsular invasion, 10 oncocytic) and 15 follicular carcinomas (9 \"classic\", 6 oncocytic) were stained immunohistochemically with anti-CD15, galectin-3 and HBME-1. In the whole group we found statistically significant differences in CD15 expression between follicular adenomas and carcinomas. \"Classic\" follicular carcinomas (without oncocytic tumors) showed stronger CD15 and HBME- 1 expression than \"classic\" adenomas. Adenomas with intracapsular invasion differed from \"classic\" adenomas only in HBME-1 expression. In oncocytic tumors the expression of examined antigens was similar. 1. In the group of nonoxyphilic tumors positive reaction with HBME-1 was more common in adenomas with intracapsular invasion and carcinomas, but positive reaction with anti-CD15--only in carcinomas. We suggest that reactivity with these antibodies could mark malignancy. 2. Oncocytic tumors had similar expression of CD15 and HBME-1 and galectin-3. ","1248":"Cancer of thyroid gland is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. The treatment improvement could be achieved by early diagnosis. The aim of the study was to identify cancer specific antigenes with use of peptide libraries. The material from 6 patients with thyroid cancer (4 with papillary cancer, 1 with follicular cancer and 1 with oxyphilic tumor) were analyzed. It was performed with use of lipophylic peptide libraries by direct comparison of staining of specimens prepared from normal and malignant tissue. Preliminary results confirm practical value of peptide libraries in early diagnostics of thyroid cancer. It is important to optimize construction of peptide libraries by using different staining agents hydrolyzed by proteases. ","1249":"Lowered and non-homogenous echogenicity in patients with chronic thyroiditis (CT) may cause problems in revealing focal lesions in ultrasound scans. Moreover, frequent anisocytosis of thyroid follicular cells and of oncocytes may falsely suggest neoplastic growth. The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of CT diagnosed in patients subjected to fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the thyroid in years 1994-2005, as well as to assess the cancer frequency in the operated patients with CT. As much as 23 173 cytological reports and corresponding outcomes were analyzed and in patients treated surgically verified against postoperative histopathological examinations. Moreover, the analysis of cytological smears in CT with distinguishing its types (lymphocytic, epithelial-hyperplastic, colloidal, oxyphillic) was performed in 50 patients; the changes between subsequent FNABs in the picture of the smears were also assessed. The frequency of diagnosed CT had been increasing in the evaluated time span from 2.6% to 9.7% (p &lt; 0.0001). There were 11 cases of papillary carcinoma found coexisting with CT. The analysis of cytological types of CT showed that the lymphocytic type prevailed over the others (lymphocytic - 43%, colloidal--21%, epithelial-hyperplastic--20%, oxyphilic--16%, p &lt; 0.001). The evolution in time of the cytological picture was observed. The increase in the frequency of CT observed in smears obtained from the thyroid gland and the reports on the coexistence of CT with papillary carcinoma suggest the necessity of prudent diagnostics and follow-up of patients with CT. ","1250":"The aim of this study was to find the ultrasound (US) features which can be helpful in selecting small thyroid lesions for fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). The outcomes were analyzed of US examinations, FNABs, and postoperative histopathological examinations performed during the years 2000-2005. The occurrence of small lesions of the thyroid revealed by US was assessed. Then, palpability and several US features of those lesions were evaluated, like the total echogenicity, the pattern of vascularisation, the presence of microcalcifications and coexistence with other lesions in the goitre. Those features were correlated with the results of histopathological examinations. Altogether 356 lesions found in 284 patients were analyzed, of which 315 were non-neoplastic lesions, 12 - follicular neoplasms, and 29 - thyroid carcinomas. The small thyroid lesions were revealed in 53.8% patients examined by US. The detailed analysis of US outcomes and the postoperative histopathological examinations showed that carcinomas with diameter &lt;or= 10 mm when compared with small benign lesions presented more frequently as solitary lesions (48.2% vs. 16.2%; p &lt; 0.001), hypoechoic (72.5% vs. 45.6%; p &lt; 0.01) and with microcalcifications (10.3% vs. 1.5%; p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, carcinomas with extrathyroidal invasion were hypoechoic more frequently than the other carcinomas (90.0% vs. 36.8%; p &lt; 0.05). The obtained results show the necessity for the limitation of number of performed biopsies in case of small thyroid lesions. They also provide rationale for consideration of some US features (like lowered echogenicity, the presence of microcalcifications or other lesions in the goitre) during selection of lesions to FNAB. ","1251":"Osteoporosis maintains a special position in today's medicine, regarding both its growing incidence and its clinical and social consequences--fractures, leading to the loss of self-dependence, disabilities and higher mortality rates. It was thought for many years that osteoporosis affected mainly women after menopause. At present, it is known that the problem concerns men, as well. In the present review, similarities and differences between osteoporosis in either sex are discussed, concentrating on epidemiological and pathogenetic aspects, as well as on therapeutic differences.","1252":"We describe a 37 year-old woman case of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). She was presented with unfounded weight loss. The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was established on twice plasma glucose measurements above 200 mg\/dl. In other routine biochemical examinations we did not observe dehydratation, electrolyte depletion, acidosis. However plasma level of C peptide basal and after stimulation with glucagon was reduced. Initially, the patient responded well to sulphonylurea treatment. To test immunological pathogenesis we examine autoimmune markers of diabetes type 1. Autoimmune antibodies (GAD, IAA) were found in patients and her parents, which were until now diabetic type 2. We report this case because incidence of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults is underestimate and rarely diagnosed in clinical practice.","1253":"The accident that occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986, released large quantities of radionuclides--among them radioiodine--into the atmosphere, thereby raising public concerns about its influence on thyroid structure and function, especially the development of malignancy. There were even reports about 700 deaths due to thyroid carcinoma in Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus, resulting from the accident. In this review we discussed the incidence of thyroid cancer in different parts of the world, especially in heavily contaminated countries, as Ukraine and Belarus, and the possible link between radioisotope activity in the thyroid and the development of malignancy. The study carried out in Minsk showed 40-fold increase of the incidence of thyroid cancer in the years 1986-1994, in comparison to the period 1977-1985. An increase of the incidence of thyroid cancer has generally been observed in many countries after the Chernobyl accident. We focused on the factors that may have an influence on this phenomenon, especially diagnostic tests, health care, social and environmental factors, like iodine level in water and soil. The results of molecular biology studies, e.g. RET translocation in carcinoma type RET\/PTC1 in elderly and RET\/PTC3 in children, and expression Ax1 and Gas6 in children were reviewed as well. We also mentioned other thyroid diseases, like nodular goitre, cysts, the disturbance of thyroid function and autoimmunity, possibly linked to the radiation after Chernobyl accident. Data obtained from the regions near Chernobyl showed no increased risk of other types of malignancy (leukaemia, Hodgkin's and non Hodgkin's lymphoma) in 1986-1996. In this article the epidemiology of thyroid diseases in Poland was also reviewed.","1254":"Human neoplastic cells express and often even over-express the somatostatin receptors (sstr). It concerns not only pituitary tumors and the so-called neuroendocrine tumors of the gut, but many other neoplasms, including the non-endocrine cancers. The incidence of sstr is important because it determines the possibility of treatment with SST (somatostatin) analogs. The examination of sstr is possible under the in vivo conditions, by means of the receptor scintigraphy using the radiolabeled SST analogs. The receptors can be also examined under the ex vivo-in vitro conditions, using the post-surgical or biopsy specimens. Among the in vitro (ex vivo) methods, the immunohistochemical investigation with specific anti-receptor antibodies seems to be particularly useful for routine clinical diagnostics. This review presents the data, obtained by means of different in vitro techniques, on the incidence of five sstr subtypes in the different human tumors, deriving from endocrine glands, diffuse neuroendocrine cells as well as in neoplasms considered as non-endocrine.","1255":"The occurrence of gland tumors causes significant clinical problem. Non hormone-secreting tumors provide the most complicated diagnostic difficulties. The application of contrast-enhanced sonography could improve the vessels visualization and point out characteristic features of benign and malignant changes. The authors believe that this new method make possible the differential adrenal tumor diagnostic process more precise and increase the specificity of ultrasonography in the recognition of benign and malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to define the usefulness of contrasting agent Levovist in differential diagnostics of adrenal tumors and its influence on sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound examination and to establish patients qualification criteria for surgical procedures. Ultrasound examinations were made with the use of digital devise by GE Voluson 740, probe 4-6 mHz with Doppler options and volumetric probe 3D according to the following protocol: 26 patients with recognized adrenal tumor were qualified for the examination. Patients in the first stage of tumor vascularization had Doppler examination with color (CD) and power Doppler (PD). Three-dimensional ultrasonography was used to improve visualization of vascularization. In the final phase of the examination the patients were administrated of Levovist in the recommended by the producer dose: 2.5 g in the concentration of 400 mg\/l. 26 cases of adrenal gland tumours were subjected to analysis. In standard ultrasonographic examination focal changes in 25 patients were hipoechogenic focuses and in one case the focus was hyperechogenic. Heterogeneity of focuses was observed in 16 cases. In Doppler examination with color (CD) and power Doppler (PD) vascular blood flow was revealed within 12. After using contrasting agent Levovist vascular blood flow was achieved in 4 additional cases, which constituted 61%. 1. 3D ultrasound could be useful in cases of big adrenal tumors--over 3 cm diameter after application of ultrasound contrast agents. 2. The use of Levovist in Doppler examination improves the visualization of tumor vascularization. However, it is impossible to differentiate benign from malignant tumors unequivocally. ","1256":"Possible relationships between breast cancer and thyroid hormones have been suggested for many years. The aim of this study was qualitative examination of triiodothyronine receptors (TR) in breast cancer tissues and in non cancerous breast tissue taken from the opposite side to the localization of the tumor. The material consisted of 15 breast cancer tissues of grades G1 to G3 and the same number of control tissues obtained during radical mastectomy or local tumor resection. Tissues were homogenized. Protein fraction was isolated. Protein for TR was assessed in Western Blot reaction. Protein fraction for TR was present in all cancer tissues and 6 healthy controls. Obtained data may suggest so far unknown role of thyroid hormones and their nuclear receptors in the generation and development of breast cancer. ","1257":"Previous studies have shown the presence of oxidative stress in hyperthyroid patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of hyperthyroidism on lipid peroxidation, plasma lipoprotein oxidation and antioxidant status. We have estimated the clinical utility of the biochemical parameters analysed as markers of oxidative stress in hyperthyroidism. Twenty five patients with overt hyperthyroidism because of Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goitre and 20 healthy subjects were included in the study. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measurement of peroxides and malondialdehyde with 4-hydroxynonenal (MDA + 4-HNE) concentrations. Autoantibodies against oxidised LDL (anti-oxLDL) were assayed as a marker of lipoprotein oxidation. Changes in the antioxidant defence system were estimated by measurement of total antioxidant status in serum (TAS) and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity (SOD). A significant increase in serum concentration of peroxides and MDA + 4-HNE was observed in patients with hyperthyroidism. However, no difference was found in anti-oxLDL concentration and antioxidant status parameters (TAS, SOD) between the control group and the patient group. Our results indicate an intensification of the oxidative processes caused by an excess of thyroid hormones, which is not accompanied by a response from the antioxidant system. Elevated concentrations of lipid peroxidation products in serum, both peroxides and malondialdehyde with 4-hydroxynonenal, may be useful as markers of oxidative stress during the course of hyperthyroidism. ","1258":"It has been reported that hyperthyroidism is associated with an altered endothelial function and increased risk of arterial thromboembolism. The aim of our study was to estimate chosen markers of endothelial dysfunction in iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis (IIT). The groups studied consisted of 41 hyperthyroid subjects, who had been treated with amiodarone (n = 6) or vitamin preparations supplemented with iodine (n = 35) and 40 persons with normal thyroid function. The following parameters were measured: thyroglobulin antibodies (TG Ab), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO Ab), THS receptor antibodies (TR Ab), soluble adhesion molecules: sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1, von Willebrand factor (vWF), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and urine iodine concentration. Patients with IIT had significantly higher levels of sVCAM-1 (p &lt; 0.01), IL-6 (p &lt; 0.005), fibrinogen (p &lt; 0.005) and CRP (p &lt; 0.05) in comparison to healthy subjects, whereas sICAM-1, PAI-1 and vWF concentrations did not differ between the groups studied. The highest sVCAM-1 levels were observed in patients with amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis, and fibrinogen and CRP--in subjects receiving vitamin preparations. There were significant correlations between sVCAM-1 concentration and the levels of sICAM-1 (r = 0.341; p = 0.029) and PAI-1 (r = 0.347; p = 0.026), as well as with urine iodine concentration (r = 0.448; p = 0.004). IL-6 concentration correlated with vWF (r = 0.456; p = 0.003), TPO Ab (r = 0.328; p = 0.036) and PAI-1 level (r = 0.319; p = 0.042). Iodine induced thyrotoxicosis is associated with an increase of sVCAM-1 and IL-6 levels, possibly reflecting inflammatory and destructive processes in the thyroid gland. However, increased procoagulant activity was not found in patients with IIT. ","1259":"There are many factors causing endothelial dysfunction. The aim was to observe chosen markers of endothelial function in patients with subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism. We studied 97 patients with hyperthyroidism: 51 with subclinical (44 F\/7 M; mean age 49.3 +\/- 15.9 y) and 46 patients with overt (39 F\/7 M, mean age 50.4 +\/- 13.2 y). The control comprised of 39 healthy volunteers (26 F\/13 M, mean age 47.5 +\/- 11.8 y). Concentration of TSH, FT3, FT4 were measured by MEIA, TPO Ab, TG Ab, E-selectin, interleukin 6, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 by ELISA. The goiter was found in 71 persons 63F\/8M, mean age 49.9 +\/- 15.3 y, (42-subclinical, 29-overt). Morbus Graves-Basedow was diagnosed in 26 persons, 20 F\/6 M, mean age 49.5 +\/- 12.8 y (9-subclinical, 17-overt). There were no significant differences serum concentration of E-selectin, IL-6, ICAM-1 in patients with subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism compared to the control. Statistically significant differences were shown between concentration of IL-6 in patients with Graves-Basedow compared with the control (p &lt; 0.05). Significance of VCAM-1 values were found in the patients with subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism compared to the control (p &lt; 0.001; p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Among persons with overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism occurs endothelial dysfunction which doesn't depends on exciting cause of thyrotoxicosis but on degree of hyperthyroidism. Elevated concentrations of endothelial markers may confirm that persons with thyroid disorders are extremely exposed to the occurrence of the cardiovascular diseases. ","1260":"The increased sensitivity of imaging devices raised number of incidentally discovered lesions in various organs of the human body. Thyroid gland is one of them. Reported prevalence of ultrasonographically detected thyroid nodules (incidentalomas) in general population ranges from 5.2 to 67.0%. Our study demonstrated occurrence of this clinical problem in the general population of the Tricity. 135 healthy adults (95 women and 40 men) were examined. Neck palpation, ultrasonographic examinations of thyroid gland and serum tyreotropin (TSH) level measurement were made. In 8.9% of examine (12\/135) persons nodules were palpable whereas in 14.8% (20\/135) they were detectable only in ultrasonographic examination. Altogether thyroid ultrasound and palpation revealed nodules in 23.7% (32\/135) of all cases. Multiple nodules were present in 12.0% of the cases. The pathology was more common in the elderly and in women. TSH serum level was within normal range in all cases of incidentaloma with otherwise normal thyroid gland. Prevalence of thyroid gland nodules (palpation--8.9% plus ultrasonography--14.8%) in healthy population of Gdansk, Gdynia and Sopot is close to data reported in southern Finland (27.0%) and Belgium (19.0%), where iodine deficiency is small, like in the Tricity area. The revealed lesions were over two times more frequent in the female population. Most of the nodules were not palpable. ","1261":"Androgens are defined as the steroids having a binding affinity of the androgen receptor. In the reproduction age a daily production of testosterone is equally divided between the ovaries and adrenal and local tissue conversion of androstenedione and DHEA. After menopause the 80% of testosterone is produced in ovaries, but majority of precursors for peripheral conversion is adrenal origin. Androgen receptors are present throughout in the body; over 200 cellular actions of androgens have been described. Androgenic action is determined by quantitative level of the androgen present in the circulation, its degree of binding to proteins, the degree of interconversion to other androgens and estrogens, and the biological potency and androgen receptor binding affinity of the androgen. The most common clinical symptoms of androgen deficiency are the reduction of sex motivation, sex fantasy, sex enjoyment, sex arousal, vaginal vasocongestion, but also reduction of pubic hair, bone mass, muscle mass, worsening of quality of life (mood, affect, energy), more frequent vasomotors symptoms, insomnia, depression, headache. All these signs and symptoms can be multifactorial. Most common conditions associated with hypoandrogenism in women are hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities, lack or insufficiency of ovaries, adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid therapy, exogenous estrogen administration. Besides the clinical picture the free testosterone measuring is important for diagnosis. The method of choice of this measure is equilibrium dialysis assay. Despite of clinical importance of androgen insufficiency in women, none of methods of androgen substitution is approved by FDA.","1262":"Hashimoto disease is the most frequent cause of women's hypothyroidism in the reproductive period. It can, both directly and indirectly, influence the fertility, pregnancy, and fetus development. Nevertheless congenital hypothyroidism is very occasionally the consequence of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. The neonatal hypothyroidism screening makes the early thyroxin treatment possible and prevents the development of complications from central nervous system. The authors showed main problems of Hashimoto disease in women during pregnancy as well as pregestational and postgestational period. The reasons of congenital hypothyroidism taking into account both iodine deficiency and excess were also presented.","1263":"One of the chief findings in polycystic ovaries syndrome may be the defective luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. There is a growing list of publications indicating a defective progesterone production by granulosa cells of ovarian follicles. In consequence, women with polycystic ovaries often require both the luteal phase and early pregnancy supplementation. From different routes of progesterone administration during the menstrual cycle, as the most clinically reliable in the early pregnancy either intramuscular or intravaginal route has been recommended.","1264":"In 2004 the first livebirth after cryopreserved ovarian tissue transplantation has been reported which is a turning point in fertility preservation after anticancer treatment and a result of almost 50 years of research. However transplantation of cryopreserved ovary is still experimental method and further study needs to be done on the risk of cancer cell reimplantation, this method is very promising for cancer patients who wants to preserve fertility after cancer treatment. This is a review of methods used for cryopreserved ovarian tissue.","1265":"Recent advances in stem cells therapy and tissue engineering techniques hold great promise for recovery of external urethral sphincter proper functioning and urinary incontinent patients treatment. Adult stem cells (ASCs) may be derived from striated muscles, fat tissue or as mesenchymal cells from bone marrow. These cells can differentiate in functionally normal smooth or striated muscle cells. ASCs injected to external urethral sphincter or bladder neck cause the increase in urethral closure pressure. Favourable findings of trials in animal models and in vitro encouraged to first trials in humans and hold a promising future for the treatment of urinary incontinence.","1266":"Turner's syndrome is defined as a congenital disease determining by quantitative and\/or structural aberrations of one from two X chromosomes with frequent presence of mosaicism. Clinically it is characterized by growth and body proportion abnormalities, gonadal dysgenesis resulting in sexual infantilism, primary amenorrhoea, infertility, characteristic stigmata, anomalies of heart, renal and bones and the presence of some diseases like Hashimoto thyroiditis with hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 2, osteoporosis, hypertension. Turner's syndrome occurs in 1:2000 to 1:2500 female livebirth. The most frequent X chromosome aberrations in patients with phenotype of Turner syndrome are as follows: X monosomy - 45,X; mosaicism (50-75%), including 45,X\/46,XX (10-15%), 45,X\/46,XY (2-6%), 45,X\/46,X,i(Xq), 45,X\/46,X,del(Xp), 45,X\/46,XX\/47,XXX; aberration of X structure: total or partial deletion of short arm of X chromosome (46,X,del(Xp)) isochromosom of long arm of X chromosome (46,X,(i(Xq)), ring chromosome (46, X,r(X)), marker chromosome (46,X+m). Searching of X chromosome and mapping and sequencing of genes located at this chromosome (such as SHOX, ODG2, VSPA, SOX 3) have made possible to look for linkage between phenotypes and adequate genes or regions of X chromosome. In this paper current data concerning correlation between phenotype and karyotype in patients with TS have been presented.","1267":"Prolactin (PRL) is one of the most commonly assessed hormones, and hyperprolactinaemia seems to be often endocrine disorder. Hyperprolactinaemia is not a disease, but only a symptom indicating relevant medical conditions to be diagnosed and properly treated. Laboratory findings should be always cautiously interpreted with reference to clinical context. Possible problems could be evoked by errors during sampling and assessment itself. While interpreting laboratory results, one have to pay attention on pulsate secretion profile of PRL (within hours), and shows marked diurnal cycle (with maximum during sleep period). PRL level depends also on emotional status (stress amplifies PRL secretion), and also on dietary habits and stimulants. Lastly, a growing body of evidence proven that in some cases elevated PRL level could be caused by presence of polymeric form of PRL--so called \"macroprolactin\". This form has diminished receptor-binding specificity and weak, if any, biological effect while immunoreactivity is preserved. In clinical practice, in cases of macroprolactinaemia high level of circulating hormone does not correlate with slight, if even, clinical symptoms. To avoid errors in prolactin assessment blood should be drawn fasting, preferentially in series or during dynamic test after dopaminergic blockade with metoclopramide. Interpretation must parallel include clinical data. It is essential that PRL level is proportional to pituitary lactotroph tumor size. Extremely high PRL concentration could exceed technical capability of laboratory equipment and remain underestimated, or even undiagnosed. Beneath presented algorithm could be useful in planning diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.","1268":"Since the birth of Louise Brown in July 1978 and the birth of the first intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) child in January 1992 many couples with female-factor or male-factor infertility can be helped to overcome their infertility resulting in a delivery and birth of a child. Over a million children have been born from assisted conception worldwide. Newer techniques being introduced appear less and less 'natural', such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), but there is little information on these children beyond the neonatal period. This risk varied according to the patient's age, the type of ART procedure performed, the number of embryos transferred, and embryo availability. ART is associated with low increase risk of congenital malformations, major birth defects and genetic and imprinting disorders.","1269":"There is large body of evidence to show that the risk of early pregnancy loss is higher after IVF-ET than after natural conception. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. One of the possible etiopathogetic factors is the patient's age which is significantly higher in women undergoing IVF than in the general population of naturally conceiving women. Immunologic factors have also been suggested. It seems that procedures like ICSI do not increase the risk of spontaneous abortion (SAB) after IVF-ET. Moreover, the proportion of products of conception with chromosomal aberration in cases of SAB following ICSI procedure is not elevated. Many authors point to the problem of iatrogenic luteal defect after IVF-ET. The use of luteal support after IVF-ET is widely recommended. Interestingly, firm evidence is lacking regarding the efficacy of progestagen or hCG supplementation on the risk of SAB after IVF-ET. However the issue of the effectiveness of progesterone support in decreasing the risk of SAB after ART procedures is far from being conclusively resolved--it deserves well planned, randomized studied to be performed.","1270":"According to the socio-sexological reports approximately 40-45% of women and up to 30% of males may suffer from different sexual dysfunctions. The prevalence of those disorders is gradually increasing with age. Multiply numbers of endocrinopathies may influence the human sexual life. In diabetic patients all phases of the sexual responses cycle, especially orgasm, might be affected. Women diagnosed with PCOS have decreased adaptation to the sexual life, low self-esteem and perception of self sexual attractiveness. The intimacy of infertile couples has not been well described and the characteristic of particular dysfunction in sex life has not been established yet. Interdisciplinary approach, understood as treatment of the endocrinopathy accompanied with psychological and sexological counseling, seems to be the fundamental issue in the therapy of sexual dysfunctions in patients with endocrinological disorders.","1271":"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is considered to be the main reason of hyperandrogenism in reproductive women. There are often metabolic disorders connected with carbohydrate and adipose metabolism in the patients with PCOS. However, presence of metabolic disorders does not influence the diagnosis of the syndrome. The investigations demonstrated that the changes in lifestyle and use of proper medications could normalize endocrine system and metabolism through insulin-sensitivity increase and in the result it could restore the menses and ovulations. This paper introduces present knowledge concerning metabolic disorders associated with PCOS.","1272":"This paper rewers to effects of aging on changes in hormonal circadian rhythms. To the most frequent changes related to aging belong attenuation and shortening of amplitude as well as desynchronization of rhythms. These changes may determine pathophysiological and therapeutic base for hormonal therapy.","1273":"According to present terminology, the name: hormonal replacement therapy (as the use of ovarian hormones in postmenopausal women) is replaced by the systemic estrogen therapy (ET) and combined combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT). Treatment with estrogen and progestagens in this period of women's life is accepted intervention only when the strict defined conditions of this therapy are maintained. This paper introduces present rules of the use of systemic ET and EPT according to statements of experts who are interested of menopausal women' treatment.","1274":"A pheochromocytoma is a neoplasm composed of cells which synthesize and release catecholamines. These tumors produce the hypertension which can be cured with surgical excision of the lesion. The pathological picture of pheochromocytomas is varied and nothing but the presence of metastases can determine aggressiveness of this neoplasm. Current studies try to look for other biological markers which can separate malignant tumors before they metastasize. It allows to target with more effective therapy. Many studies analyze details of microscopic features of these tumors, immunohistochemical markers and molecular disorders. It seems that the most important factor in estimation of aggressiveness of pheochromocytomas is PASS scale. The detection of high expression of telomerase and hTERT and high proliferative activity, measured by immunohistochemistry with the MIB-1 antibody supports most strongly biological malignancy of pheochromocytoma.","1275":"We present a case of 50 year-old man with feminizing adrenal carcinoma. He was admitted to the hospital because of weakness and one year history of gynecomastia and high blood pressure. Examinations revealed a large left adrenal mass and increased levels of estradiol. Patient underwent adrenalectomy and followed by mitotan therapy as the result of histopathological examination was adrenocortical carcinoma. One year after operation patient stays free from the recurrence of the disease and his estradiol, androstendion and DHEA levels are below the detection limits. We report this case because feminizing adrenal carcinoma is a very rare but serious disease and gynecomastia that could be its manifestation is quite frequent symptom in men's population and thus it could easily be missed. In every case of gynecomastia related to estradiol excess feminizing tumors of testis and adrenal gland should be ruled out.","1276":"The role of gastrins and their receptors in the pathogenesis of colon cancer has been discussed for many years but it still remains unresolved. Although fluorouracil (FU) remains to be reference chemotherapy for colon cancer, its efficacy is unsatisfactory. Recently, we have shown a synergistic effect of proglumide (a non-selective blocker of cholecystokinin-gastrin receptors) applied together with FU, on the proliferation and apoptosis of transplantable Colon 38 cancer cells in vivo. The aim of this study was to examine direct effects of proglumide (10(-5)-10(-10) M) applied either alone or together with FU (0.25, 2.5 and 25 microg\/ml) on the proliferation of murine Colon 38 cancer cells in vitro. Cell proliferation was assessed by the modified colorimetric Mosmann method. Proglumide inhibited the proliferation of Colon 38 cells at the concentrations of 10(-6), 10(-8) and 10(-10) M. FU inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in all studied concentrations, exerting the most profound antiproliferative effect at the concentrations of 2.5 and 25 microg\/ml. Thus, the former concentration was chosen to study its interactions with proglumide. Proglumide applied together with FU exerted a synergistic effect on the inhibition of proliferation of Colon 38 cells at 10(-8), 10(-9), 10(-10) M concentrations. The most profound inhibitory effect was observed in the group incubated with FU and 10(-10) M of proglumide. The obtained results indicate a possibility of new therapeutic options for colon cancer, but further studies are needed to elucidate, if the synergistic effect of FU and proglumide occurs also in the colon cancer in humans.","1277":"Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) is the main factor, which regulates GH secretion and somatotrope proliferation. However, its chronic effect on anterior pituitary gland is still unknown. It is known that excessive GHRH secretion in patients with gastroenteropancreatic tumors secreting GHRH results in acromegaly and somatotrope hyperplasia. In mice transgenic for GHRH somatotrope tumors develop. Thus, the aim of this paper was to examine the effect of GHRH chronic administration on somatotrope secretion, their percentage and cell proliferation in anterior pituitary gland in rats. The experiment was performed on male Fischer 344 rats weighing 200+\/-20 g. The animals were divided into two groups: group I-controls (13 rats) received solvent for GHRH (5% ethanol in demineralized water); group II (10 rats) received GHRH (Growth Hormone Releasing Factor, fragment 1-29 amide) at a dose of 5 microg\/day. The substances were given for 1 month via osmotic pump (ALZET), which were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal region under ketamin anesthesia. After 4 weeks all rats were decapitated and the blood was collected. In the microscopic preparations of anterior pituitary gland the morphology of pituitary (Herlant staining) and the percentage of somatotrope cells and proliferation index based on PCNA staining were assessed. It was found that the chronic treatment with GHRH caused a statistically significant increase in serum rGH concentration and in percentage of somatotropes, but did not change proliferation index and did not induce pathological changes in the morphology of the anterior pituitary gland when compared to the control group. Summing up, monthly GHRH administration did not induce somatotrope adenomas but it caused serum GH level elevation, what seems to depend partially on the increase of somatotrope number.","1278":"of the present study was to evaluate serum concentrations of adrenal and ovarian androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin in obese women without additional diseases and in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome with and without insulin resistance. The study group involved 73 obese women (39 with PCOS--A and 34 obese without additional diseases--B). The serum concentration of glucose and insulin were measured and the study group was divided on the basis of HOMA index into two subgroups: A I-PCO without insulin resistance (n=18, mean age 27.2+\/-5.9 yr; BMI 33.2+\/-3.5 kg\/m2); AII-PCO with insulin resistance (n=21, mean age 27.5+\/-7.1 yr; BMI 37.6+\/-6.5 kg\/m2); B I-obese without insulin resistance (n=8, age 33.5+\/-7.5 yr; BMI 35.2+\/-4.8 kg\/m2); B II-obese with insulin resistance (n=24, age 30.3+\/-5.2 yr; BMI 36.4+\/-5.8 kg\/m2). Body mass and height were measured and body mass index was calculated with formula. Body composition was measured using bioimpedance method. The serum concentrations of FSH, LH, total and free testosterone, androstendione, DHEAS, SHBG and insulin were determined by RIA method and glucose was determined by enzymatic procedure. We observed significantly higher body mass, fat mass and BMI in AII subgroup when compared to AI, BI and BII subgroups. Only serum concentration of free testosterone was significantly higher in AII subgroup when compared to AI subgroup. We observed a positive correlation between serum concentrations of insulin and free testosterone in both groups A and B, moreover we observed positive correlations between serum concentrations of insulin and both DHEAS and LH in group B. It seems that insulin resistance plays a key role in the development of hyperandrogenism in obese women. However mechanisms leading to hyperandrogenism in PCOS are still unrevealed and seem to be more complex. ","1279":"Basal leptin level has been demonstrated to correlate positively with many indices of obesity, as well as insulin resistance. However, to date, little is known about regulation of leptin in obese children with incipient glucose metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to define the precise influence of the glucose tolerance status on plasma leptin in obese boys and girls separately. 70 obese children with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and well-matched 70 normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) subjects were examined. Fasting and 2-h post glucose load plasma glucose and insulin levels as well as fasting leptin levels were determined, apart from anthropometric measurements. Leptin levels were significantly lower in girls with IGT compared to NGT girl (17.7+\/-6.5 microg\/L vs. 23.1+\/-7.7 microg\/L; p&lt;.001). No such difference was observed in boys. In a multiple regression analysis adjusting for age and adiposity, in the female group plasma glucose and insulin levels 2-h after glucose load were the best predictors of fasting plasma leptin (r=-0.49, p&lt;.005 and r=0.34, p&lt;.05; respectively). In boys, plasma insulin level 2-h after glucose load was the independent determinant of leptin (r=0.36, p&lt;.05). The differences between regulation of leptin synthesis in girls and boys with simple obesity were found. The stimulatory effect of insulin on leptin synthesis was greater in girls with normoglycemia than in girls with impaired glucose tolerance. ","1280":"Adrenal pheochromocytoma are diagnosed the most often in patients with arterial hypertension or with thyroid medullar cancer and suspicion of MEN II syndromes. The aim of the study is to analyse the morphology of pheochromocytomas on the basis of Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal Gland Scaled Score (PASS) in order to estimate their potential malignancy. Forty tumours were subjected to analysis. Mean patients age was 45.2+\/-13.4 years. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was establish before surgery in 87.5%. 12.5% of patients were referred to surgery on the basis of tumour diameter (range 70 to 102 mm). In 20.0% of patients MEN II syndromes were diagnosed. In pathological examination benign pheochromo-cytoma was diagnosed in 39 presented patients. In 1 cases malignant form of pheochromocytoma was diagnosed on the basis of lymph nodes metastases. Number of points in PASS was &gt;or=4 in 9 of 40 tumours (22.5%). Among 35 patients operated on more than 12 months ago 2 patients died: 1 patient with malignant pheochromocytoma (PASS=8 points) and 1 patient with MEN IIA syndrome (due to disseminated thyroid medullar cancer). In remaining 7 observed patients with PASS&gt;or=4 points neither recurrence nor metastases were diagnosed within the period of observation (13-90 months). In 1 out of patients with PASS&lt;4 points a local recurrence was surgically removed 82 months after primary operation. Analysis of pheochromocytoma in PASS is only of rough character and does not allow for clear-cut histological diagnosis of benign and malignant tumours. The only unquestionable criterion of pheochromocytoma's malignancy remain metastases. ","1281":"The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of DHEA therapy on insulin resistance (FIRI, FG\/FI) and serum lipids in men with angiographically verified coronary heart disease (CHD). The study included thirty men aged 41-60 years (mean age 52+\/-0.90 yr) with serum DHEA-S concentration&lt;2000 microg\/l, who were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Subjects completed the 80 days study of 40 days of 150 mg oral DHEA daily or placebo, and next groups were changed after 30 days of wash-out. Fasting early morning blood samples were obtained at baseline and after each treatment to determine serum hormones levels (testosterone, DHEA-S, LH, FSH estradiol and IGF-1) and also metabolic profile (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglicerides, HDL-cholesterol, insulin, glucose, fasting insulin resistance index--FIRI and FG\/FI ratio). Administration of DHEA was associated with 4.5-fold increase in DHEA-S levels. Relative to baseline DHEA administration resulted in a decrease in insulin levels by 40% (p&lt;0.005) and fasting insulin resistance index (FIRI) by 47% (p&lt;0.004). Also total cholesterol levels and LDL-cholesterol levels decreased significantly (from 222.9+\/-6.6 mg\/dL to 207.4+\/-6.6 mg\/dL and from 143.9+\/-6.9 mg\/dL to 130.5+\/-6.0 mg\/dL respectively; p&lt;0.05). Glucose levels dropped significant below baseline values after DHEA (p&lt;0.001). Estrogen levels significantly increased after DHEA (p&lt;0.05). While changes of serum concentrations of testosterone, LH, FSH, IGF-I, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides were not statistical significant. Tolerance of the treatment was good and no adverse effects were observed. DHEA therapy in dose of 150 mg daily during 40 days in men with DHEA levels&lt;2000 microg\/l decreased total cholesterol concentration, insulin and glucose levels and fasting insulin resistance index (FIRI). This therapy may be a beneficial against CHD risk factors. ","1282":"Sex hormones deficiency--hypotestosteronemia (20-30% of men) and dehydroepian-drosterone sulfate deficiency (60-70% of men) are often observed in elderly men. In these men also changes of body composition (visceral obesity, increasing of fat mass), and metabolic disturbances (hypercholesterolemia, hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance) are common disorders. Visceral obesity and insulin resistance may be either reasons or effects of testosterone deficiency. Probably also DHEA-S deficiency is the risk factor of visceral obesity and insulin resistance, but it is not clear, whether this possible influence is independent from testosterone deficiency. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between testosterone and DHEA deficiency and waist\/hip ratio (WHR), levels of glucose and insulin resistance (HOMA and FG\/FI) in elderly men as well as analysis, whether these sex hormones influent on measured parameters separately. Together 85 men with age from 60 to 70 years men (mean 66.3+\/-1.5 years; mean+\/-SEM) was analyzed. Testosterone levels&lt;4 ng\/ml or DHEA levels&lt;2000 ng\/ml and BMI&lt;30 kg\/m2 were including criteria. Patients were divided into three groups: 52 with testosterone deficiency (L-T), 32 with DHEA deficiency (L-DHEA-S) and 67 with deficiency of both sex hormones (L-T\/DHEA-S). Statistical analysis was made using Student-t, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney tests. Testosterone levels in L-T, L-DHEA and L-T\/DHEA groups were respectively 3.19+\/-0.23 ng\/ml, 4.89+\/-0.45 ng\/ml and 3.25+\/-0.34 g\/ml (p&lt;0.002). While DHEA-S levels were respectively 2498+\/-98 ng\/ml, 1435+\/-1010 ng\/ml and 1501+\/-89 ng\/ml). BMI values do not differ between groups. WHR ratio values were the highest in L-T\/DHEA-S group (p&lt;0.05 vs. L-T) group, significant lower in L-T group (p&lt;0.005 vs. L-DHEA-S) and the lowest in L-DHEA-S group. Insulin fasting levels were lowest in L-DHEA-S group, higher in L-T group (p&lt;0.01) and the highest in L-T\/DHEA-S group (p&lt;0.001 vs, L-T group). FG\/FI values were the highest in L-DHEA-S group, lower in L-T group (NS) and lowest in L-T\/DHEA group (p&lt;0.002 vs. L-T group). HOMA ratio values similarly did not change significantly between L-T (6.6+\/-3.21) and L-DHEA-S group (5.5+\/-2.92), although tendency to higher values in L-T group was noticed, while WHR ratio values were significantly higher in L-T\/DHEA group (7.3+\/-2.45; p&lt;0.002 vs. L-T group). DHEA-S and testosterone deficiency were independently associated with higher insulin resistance and obesity. WHR ratio seems to be more sensitive then BMI ratio to reflect the androgen deficiency on obesity and body composition in elderly men. ","1283":"Renal insufficiency is the most common etiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism. In case of resistance for conservative treatment, methods of choice are surgical intervention or percutaneous ethanol injections. The aim of the study was to evaluate usefulness of percutaneous ethanol injection therapy in the treatment of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. We performed percutaneous 96% ethanol injections under USG guideance in 51 patients: 22 women (mean age 49.6 years) and 29 men (46.6 yrs). The base level of parathormone was 689.35 pg\/ml. We managed to visualize one parathyroid gland in 34 patients, 2 in 12, 3 in 5 patients. The mean volume of a single gland was 0,8 cm3. All the injections were performed with the use of needle number 6. We repeated injections in case of no effects. One injection was performed in 18 patients, 2 in 18, 3 in 13, 5 in 1 and 6 in 1 patient. Before and after the treatment patients were examined with USG, scintigraphy and densitometry. Serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), parathormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase (FA) activity were also obtained. The main criteria for success was decrease in parathormone level of 50% or more in comparison with pre-injection level or to less than 200 pg\/ml. In the whole group of patients after the first month, positive results were observed in 67%. There were no changes in 23%, and PTH level increased in 10%. After 6 months-positive results in 53%, no change in 35% and increase in 12%. We noted the best results in patients with PTH less than 800 pg\/ml-72% of them had positive results after 1 as far as after the 6 month. Percutaneous ethanol injections are valuable method of treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The best results can be obtained if PTH level is less than 800 pg\/ml, one parathyroid gland dominating over the rest is visualised in USG, and if patient responds after 1 or at least 2 injections. ","1284":"As the link between body fat and leptin is well known, the aim of the study was to seek for secondary regulators of plasma leptin level. 86 women (mean: age 47.0+\/-14.3 years; estradiol 50.0+\/-60.6 ng\/l; FSH 52.4+\/-42.9 IU\/l; BMI 26.9+\/-5.9) divided into three groups according to their BMI. Group A: 39 normal weight women (mean: age 44.4+\/-16.0 years; estradiol 69.6+\/-79.8 ng\/l; FSH 50.4+\/-47.7 IU\/l; BMI 22.9+\/-1.3). Group B: 27 overweighted women (mean: age 55.0+\/-6.4 years; estradiol 25.1+\/-17.2 ng\/l; FSH 75.6+\/-26.3 IU\/l; BMI 27.7+\/-1.6). Group C: 21 obese women with mean: age 48.7+\/-12.2 years; estradiol 36.9+\/-44.0 ng\/l; FSH 42.3+\/-36.6 IU\/l and BMI 34.6+\/-4.9. Standard clinical evaluation and hormone evaluation (LH, FSH, prolactin, estradiol, leptin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), human growth hormone (hGH), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), insulin, dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), sex hormone binding globin (SHBG) and testosterone were done in basic condition which levels of were measured by RIA kits. Statistical analysis. Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon u test, Spearman rank correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple regression: p values of 0.05 or less were considered as significant. Taking all women into account (n=86) the plasma leptin level correlated directly with age (r=0.32; p&lt;0.02), body mass (r=0.60; p&lt;0.001), BMI (r=0.71; p&lt;0.001) as well as inversely with estradiol (r=-0.21; p&lt;0.05), IGF-I (r=-0.24; p&lt;0.05), SHBG (r=-0.34; p&lt;0.01) and DHEAS (r=-0.30; p&lt;0.01). However only in the group B leptin\/age relation remained (r=0.40; p&lt;0.05) after the division according to BMI. In the group B the leptin \/DHEAS (r=-0.40; p&lt;0.05) and leptin\/PRL (r=0.51; p&lt;0.05) links were also present. In the group C the leptin\/SHGB relation (r=-0.56; p&lt;0.02) only remained and an association between insulin and leptin was found (r=0.48; p&lt;0.05). The body mass and BMI relation to age were again present only in all 86 women (r=0.30; p&lt;0.002: r=0.36; p&lt;0.001 resp.). Having split the women into groups, these links either disappeared or became inverse (rC=-0.39; p&lt;0.05). Taking into consideration age\/leptin relation in all women, the division according to the menopausal status revealed the direct relation in premenopausal women (n=29; r=0.43; p&lt;0.02) and a reverse one in postmenopausal women (n=38; r=-0.32; p&lt;0.05). The plasma leptin level was the highest (p&lt;0.001) in group C (23.2+\/-10.4 microg\/l) and the lowest was found in the group A (8.9+\/-4.1 microg\/l). That corresponded with the differences in mean body mass index and mean body mass. The stepwise multiple regression revealed that body mass index accounted for 31% (p&lt;0.001) and plasma SHBG level accounted for 17.7% (p&lt;0.02) of plasma leptin variance in all women. In the group A body mass and age together accounted for 61% (p&lt;0.01) and estradiol alone accounted for 44% (p&lt;0.02) of plasma leptin variance. In the group B insulin alone accounted for 39% (p&lt;0.05) and together with testosterone accounted for 46% (p&lt;0.05) of plasma leptin variance. Finally in obese women none of the evaluated parameters significantly accounted for leptin variance. The results presented in this paper confirmed the strong influence of body fat mass on serum leptin concentration. However insulin, SHBG, sex steroids as well as age may also exert secondary influence on plasma leptin level in certain groups of women.

Basic fasting plasma hGH, IGF-I, IGFBP-3, insulin, testosterone and LH as well as prolactin (PRL), FSH and estradiol were assessed by RIA kits. Statistical analysis. Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney u-test, Spearman rang correlation coefficient, stepwise multiple regression. Mean serum IGF-I level was the lowest (p&lt;0.005) in group B (172.0+\/-54.6 microg\/l) and the highest in group C (273.6+\/-109.0 microg\/l). The mean plasma IGF-I level in group A was similar (NS) (208.3+\/-66.5 microg\/l) to that found in group B and lower (p&lt;0.02) compared with that in group C. The lowest (p&lt;0.005) serum IGFBP-3 level was found in group B (3.1+\/-0.7 microg\/l) compared to group C (4.4+\/-0.3 microg\/l). The mean plasma IGFBP-3 level (3.1+\/-1.0 microg\/l) in group A was lower than in group C (p&lt;0.005) but identical as in group B. No statistically significant differences between groups were observed in mean hGH levels. Women in group A and C were younger (p&lt;0.001) than those in group B. The lowest mean estradiol level was found in groups A and B. The highest was in group C (p&lt;0.001). Mean plasma LH and FSH levels were higher (p&lt;0.001) in groups A and B vs group C. In group C there were links between IGF-I and age (r=-0.60; p=0.014) The IGF-I\/age relation disappeared in the groups A and B (rA=-0.26; rB=0.10; NS). The same regards IGFBP-3\/ age link (rA=-0.44, NS; rB=0,31;NS). Estradiol level was related to hGH levels in group C (r=-0.54; p&lt;0.05). In none of groups hGH\/IGF-1 as well as IGFBP-3\/hGH relations were found. Prolactin accounted for 69% of the variance in IGF-I level in the group B (p=0.003) and for 24% in group A (NS). Testosterone accounted for 88% (p=0.004) of the variance in IGF-I level in group B and IGFBP-3 was responsible for 86% (p=0.038) of the variance in IGF-I level in group C. Again IGFBP-3 was responsible for 47% (p=0.023) in group A and for 49% (p=0.04) in group B of the hGH variance. 17b-estradiol may be as important contributor to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plasma level as age in hypoestrogenic, hypogonadotropic women. ","1286":"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is often associated with low bone mineral density (BMD). An open-labeled, prospective trial was conducted to determine whether alendronate (ALN), 10 mg daily, maintains or improves BMD in patients with advanced PHPT. All patients had symptomatic PHPT and met surgical guidelines however refused surgery. Nineteen patients was treated with alendronate for 2 years. The primary outcome index, BMD, was measured at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) every 6 months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum calcium, phosphorous and PTH, and urinary calcium excretion were monitored every 3 months. Treatment with alendronate over 2 years was associated with a significant (5.3+\/-0.4%; p&lt;0.01) increase in LS BMD in comparison with baseline. FN BMD increased significantly at 24 months with alendronate by 2.5%+\/-0.7 (p&lt;0.01) from baseline. Serum calcium, phosphorus and PTH, and urine calcium excretion did not change with alendronate therapy. In PHPT, alendronate significantly increases BMD at the LS and FN at 24 months from baseline values with stable serum calcium and PTH levels. Alendronate may be a useful alternative to parathyroidectomy in symptomatic PHPT among those with low BMD, who are candidates for surgery but either decline or for whom surgery is contraindicated.","1287":"Ghrelin has been found as a natural ligand of growth hormone secretagouges receptors (GHSR-1a) that exerts a marked stimulatory effect on growth hormone (GH) secretion. It is also thought to be involved of eating behavior and control of energy homeostasis. However, still little is known about the physiology of ghrelin secretion in acromegaly. The objective of the study was to examine effects of surgical and pharmacological treatment in patients with acromegaly on serum ghrelin levels. 28 patients (17 women and 11 men) aged 47.7+\/-11.4 years (mean+\/-SD) with body mass index (BMI)=31.6+\/-4.9 kg\/m2. Diagnosis was based on: 1\/peak GH in oral glucose tolerance test&gt;or=1ng\/mL, 2\/serum IGF-1 levels above normal for gender and age, 3\/ pituitary adenoma in magnetic resonance imagining. Patients were divided into two groups: Group I-surgically treated (transsphenoidal surgery): 10 women and 7 men aged 45+\/-10.9 years with BMI=31.3+\/-4.9 kg\/m2. Criteria of cure in acromaegaly were: 1\/peak GH&lt;1 ng\/ml in OGTT, 2\/serum IGHF-1 levels according to gender and age. Group II-pharmacologically treated (Sandostatin LAR, Novartis Pharm. Ltd, 20 mg im, monthly): 7 women and 4 men aged 52+\/-11 years, BMI=29.4 kg\/m2. Criteria of good control of acromegaly were: 1\/peak GH&lt;1 ng\/ml in OGTT, 2\/serum IGHF-1 levels according to gender and age. Control group-healthy subjects: 10 women and 19 men aged 47.7+\/-11.4 years, BMI=25.6 kg\/m2. In patients before and after treatment and in healthy subjects fasting serum levels of total ghrelin, leptin, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1), glucose, insulin, total cholesterol and trigliceryde levels were measured. HOMA index of insulin resistance was calculated. The patients and control subjects underwent assessment of body height, weight and BMI. Body weight and BMI in patients before treatment were higher compared to healthy controls (87.3+\/-18 to 74.4+\/-16 kg, p&lt;0.02 (body weight) and 31.6+\/-4.9 to 25.5+\/-4.1 kg\/m2, p&lt;0.0002 (BMI).

Body weight decreased during pharmacological treatment although BMI was still higher then in control subjects (30.1+\/-6.3 to 25.2+\/-4.1 kg\/m2; p&lt;0.003). Serum fasting GH and IGF-1 levels decreased after successful surgical treatment, from 26.3+\/-29 to 1.6+\/-2.5 microg\/l (p&lt;0.007) and from 926.1+\/-325 to 337+\/-213 microg\/l (p&lt;0.00003), respectively. Also during pharmacological treatment decrease in serum GH and IGF-1 levels were observed, from 29.4+\/-40 to 5.8+\/-7.6 microg\/l and from 976.3+\/-328 to 358.3+\/-203 microg\/l (p&lt;0.002), respectively. Serum insulin levels decreased after successful surgical treatment, from 29.1+\/-9.8 do 15.8+\/-7.3 microU\/ml (p&lt;0.02). Also during pharmacological treatment serum insulin levels and HOMA index decreased, from 29.8+\/-12.9 to 14.6+\/-2.1 microU\/ml (p&lt;0.03) and from 9.1+\/-3.6 to 3.5+\/-0.4 (p&lt;0.007), respectively. Serum fasting insulin and glucose levels and HOMA index were higher in patients before treatment compared to healthy subjects and didn't differ significantly after successful surgery and during pharmacotherapy. Serum ghrelin levels in patients with acromegaly were decreased compared to healthy subjects (1055.2+\/-325 to 1266.8+\/-374 pg\/ml, p&lt;0.04) and increased after successful surgical treatment, from 1164.2+\/-321 to 1553.6+\/-542 pg\/ml (p=0.01). During pharmacotherapy decrease in serum ghrelin levels was observed, from 1038.7+\/-344 to 568.5 +\/-252 pg\/ml (p&lt;0.03). There were no significant differences in serum ghrelin level between healthy controls and patients after treatment. Significant negative correlation between serum ghrelin levels and body weight (r=-0.40, p=0.04) in healthy subjects was found. In patients with acromegaly significant negative correlation between serum ghrelin levels and insulin levels and HOMA index were found (r=-0.48; p&lt;0.02 and r=-0.57; p&lt;0.03, respectively. In patients with acromegaly: 1\/serum ghrelin levels are decreased compared to healthy subjects. It can be speculated, that its at least partially caused by negative feedback control of ghrelin production and by GH-induced hyperinsulinaemia. 2\/serum ghrelin levels increase after successful transsphenoidal surgery. 3\/ treatment with somatostatin analoges causes decrease in serum ghrelin levels, despite of serum GH and IGF-1 normalization.

It is characterized by normal, or elevated TSH concentration with high concentration of T3 and T4. Here, we present a case of a 24-year-old woman who suffered from mild thyrotoxicosis and diffuse goiter for several years. She had elevated fT3 and fT4 with slightly elevated TSH concentration. Pituitary adenoma was excluded as magnetic resonance imaging showed normal pituitary gland, alpha subunit was within normal range and TSH concentration increased after TRH administration. Sonography revealed normoechogenic, slightly enlarged thyroid gland. Previously, she was given thiamazole, but without any significant amelioration. Thus, the diagnosis of the syndrome of pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone was established. The patient was given bromocriptine at a dose of 10 mg per day. After 2 months of treatment she achieved a state of constant euthyrosis and following next few months thyroid volume diminished.","1290":"Basal leptin level has been demonstrated to correlate positively with many indices of obesity, as well as insulin resistance. However, to date, little is known about regulation of leptin in obese children with incipient glucose metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to define the precise influence of the glucose tolerance status on plasma leptin in obese boys and girls separately. 70 obese children with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and well-matched 70 normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) subjects were examined. Fasting and 2-h post glucose load plasma glucose and insulin levels as well as fasting leptin levels were determined, apart from anthropometric measurements. Leptin levels were significantly lower in girls with IGT compared to NGT girl (17.7+\/-6.5 microg\/L vs. 23.1+\/-7.7 microg\/L; p&lt;.001). No such difference was observed in boys. In a multiple regression analysis adjusting for age and adiposity, in the female group plasma glucose and insulin levels 2-h after glucose load were the best predictors of fasting plasma leptin (r=-0.49, p&lt;.005 and r=0.34, p&lt;.05; respectively). In boys, plasma insulin level 2-h after glucose load was the independent determinant of leptin (r=0.36, p&lt;.05). The differences between regulation of leptin synthesis in girls and boys with simple obesity were found. The stimulatory effect of insulin on leptin synthesis was greater in girls with normoglycemia than in girls with impaired glucose tolerance. ","1291":"In some patients with hyperprolactinaemia a large portion of circulating prolactin is bound to authologous gammaglobulin and therefore it is called macroprolactin or Big-Big-Prolactin (BB-PRL). of the study was to select patients with predominance of macroprolactin and to learn more about the natural course of this disorder, in particular about the possible dependence of the presence of clinical features from the amount of circulating \"free\" PRL level, and also to search whether the quantitative proportions of both forms of PRL are stable or they change parallel to changes of the total serum PRL level. We identified 58 patients with hyperprolactinaemia, in whom BB-PRL consisted&gt;or=60% of the total PRL concentration. The predominance of macroprolactin was settled using the well accepted method of polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation of large m.w. serum proteins, followed by contemporary immunoradiometric measurement of the total and free PRL levels, and calculation of BB-PRL. Repeating such measurements during the long term observation lasting 6-66 months (mean 33 months), which was possible in 18 our patients (13--with idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia and 5--with pituitary adenoma), we could analyze the relations between both forms of PRL during the specific treatment, after it's cessation and, in few cases--during pregnancy. Apart of that, in 18 patients selected from 53 with idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia, we analyzed the shortterm alterations in the ratio between free and complexed PRL during the metoclopramide PRL stimulation test. 1. In hyperprolactinaemic patients with predominance of BB-PRL, there was no direct correlation between the presence of clinical features and the concentration of residual \"free\" PRL. 2. During the long-term observation, in spite of moderate changes in the total PRL concentration induced by the treatment or it's cessation (excluding pregnancy), the ratio of \"free\" PRL and BB-PRL remained stable. 3. During the short time of metoclopramide stimulation test, there was a marked rise mainly of the total and \"free\" PRL concentrations, and, in some tested subjects, the predominance of BB-PRL was lost temporally for 1 to 2 hours.

The characteristic feature of this region is the presence of four cysteine residues. It was proposed that cysteines in positions 29 and 41 in the receptor are connected by disulfide bonds and they are the target for receptor stimulating antibodies. The present study was aimed to check this possibility. The synthetic peptides: peptide corresponding to the part of TSHR containing the above 29-41 cysteine bond, the peptide similar to this peptide but without disulfide bond and the control peptide, containing sequence absent in the receptor were used for rabbit immunization. The thyroid status of all immunized rabbits was the same. Rabbits immunized with peptides related to TSHR generated antisera reactive with TSHR in immunoenzymatic assay. To check specificity of this reaction the influence of the peptides and the antisera on TSH binding to the receptor in competitive assay (TRAK) and their influence on adenylate cyclase activity were studied. It was found that neither synthetic peptides nor antiserum from any rabbit influenced TSH binding to the receptor in TRAK. In contrast low, but significant adenylate cyclase stimulating activity was noticed for antisera from two of six rabbit immunized by peptide containing the disulfide bond. We concluded that such a bond between cysteine residues 29 and 41 are present in TSHR in the site of stimulating antibodies epitope.","1294":null,"1295":"In our study we present chosen elements of microarray analysis of gene expression profile in papillary thyroid cancer.

These genes encode both structural and regulatory proteins in the heart (myosin heavy chains, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-activated ATP-ase, phospholamban).

Conn syndrome was diagnosed in 16 patients (14.9%), Cushing syndrome in 12 (11.2%), and virilisation in 3 (2.8%). In 76 patients (71.0%) biochemical tests did not reveal hormonal hyperactivity of the tumour. In routine histopatological examination ACC was diagnosed in 6 tumours (5.4%), adrenocortical adenoma (ACA) in 92 (83.6%) and adrenocortical hyperplasia in 12 (10.9%). Nuclear grade III or IV was observed in 8 tumours (7.3%), mitotic rate &gt; 5\/50 high power fields in 6 (5.4%), atypical mitoses in 5 (4.5%), clear cells constituting &lt; 25% of the tumour in 10 (9.1%), diffuse architecture in 8 (7.3%), necrosis in 16 (14.5%), veins infiltration in 4 (3.6%), sinusoids infiltration in 7 (6.3%), and tumour capsule infiltration in 5 (4.5%). Among ACC tumours 4-9 features of malignancy were present, among ACA--0-3 features. Statistical analysis revealed correlation between number of criteria proposed by Weiss and maximal tumour size (p &lt; 0.05). The structure and cell arrangement in adrenocortical adenoma are heterogeneous. Application of criteria proposed by Weiss in histopathological examination of adrenocortical tumours can be useful in differentiating adrenocortical adenoma from carcinoma. ","1302":"Interleukine-6 (IL-6) is one of the cytokines, excreting by adipocytes, which increases in obesity. These cytokines participate in very complicated mechanisms of developing insulin resistance that accompany obesity. The aim of the study was to: 1) evaluate the influence of weight loss on insulin resistance and serum concentration of IL-6, 2) evaluate the hypothetical association between serum concentration of IL-6 and the improvement of insulin sensitivity in obese women after weight loss. The study involved 27 obese women (age 40.3 +\/- 11.1 year; BMI 37.4 +\/- 5.2 kg\/m(2)) with insulin resistance diagnosed using HOMA index, without concomitant diseases and without any medication. All the patients participated in complex weight reduction treatment (diet, physical activity and psychotherapy). Before and after weight reduction therapy weight and height were measured, body composition was determined using bioimpedance analysis. Serum concentration of glucose was determined by enzymatic procedure, serum concentration of insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay, serum concentration of IL-6 was measured by ELISA. HOMA index was calculated with formula. The mean weight loss after 3-month was 9.2 +\/- 4.5 kg (approximately 10% of initial weight). After weight reduction significant decreases in HOMA index, insulin and IL-6 concentrations was observed. However, no correlations between changes in insulin concentrations, HOMA index and decrease of IL-6 concentration were showed. We observed significant correlations between DeltaHOMA and DeltaBMI (r = 0.48; p = 0.012) and Delta percentage fat mass (r = 0.39; p &lt; 0.05). A moderate weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and decreases serum concentrations of IL-6. However improvement of insulin sensitivity is the effect of fat mass reduction and does not change serum concentration of IL-6.

Two groups of patients were examined: 15 patients with GO without clinical signs of dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON) and 12 healthy controls. The correlations between the N75 and P100 latencies, IOP and Hertel exophthalmometry were investigated. The mean PVEP N75 and P100 latencies were significantly delayed in the GO uncomplicated with DON in comparison with controls (LP100- 106.2 +\/- 4.4 ms vs. 102.4 +\/- 2.7 ms, p &lt; 0.01 and LN75- 79.0 +\/- 3.7 ms vs. 73.9 +\/- 2.8 ms, p &lt; 0.001).

","1305":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of hypothyroidism on oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL). 24 patients with overt hypothyroidism and 10 patients with mild hypothyroidism were enrolled to the study. The control group consisted of 24 healthy subjects with normal serum TSH. Plasma level of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and serum level of antibodies against oxidized LDL (anti-oxLDL) determined lipoprotein oxidation. Significantly increased plasma oxLDL levels were found in patients with overt hypothyroidism in comparison to patients with mild hypothyroidism and control group. Anti-oxLDL levels in patients with overt or mild hypothyroidism and in the control group showed no significant differences. OxLDL plasma levels in patients with hypothyroidism inversely correlated with FT(4) levels and positively correlated with TSH, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels. The presented study indicates increased lipoprotein oxidation in patients with hypothyroidism which depends on the degree of hypothyroidism and changes in lipid profile. Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides levels are the factors increasing lipoprotein oxidation. Plasma oxLDL levels may constitute a useful marker indicating the risk for atherosclerosis in hypothyroidism.

In our study we discussed the most recent data on the accident, and the natural and synthetic sources of radiation. According to the recent data, the air at Chernobyl had been contaminated with about 5300 PBq radionuclide activity (excluding rare gases), including 1760 PBq (131)I and 85 PBq (137)Cs. The highest radiation received by the liquidators (0.8-16 Gy), lower doses were received by the population which was evacuated or inhabited the contaminated areas (in which the level of (137)Cs activity deposited in the earth was 37 kBq\/m(2)). In the European countries the highest mean radiation dose per year for the whole body in the first year after the accident was in Bulgaria (760 microSv), Austria (670 microSv) and Greece (590 microSv), while the lowest radiation dose was observed in Portugal (1.8 microSv) and Spain (4.2 microSv). In Poland the mean effective equivalent dose resulting from Chernobyl accident was 932 microSv and is close to the limited dose permitted in Poland, equalling 1 mSv\/year. The highest radiation dose to thyroid was received by inhabitants of the states previously known as Bielskopodlaskie, Nowosadeckie and the north-east region of Poland. Lowest dose was received by inhabitants of the areas previously known as Slupski and Rzeszowski.","1310":"The early medical complications of Chernobyl accident include post radiation disease, which were diagnosed in 134 subjects affected by ionizing radiation. 28 persons died during the first 100 days after the event.

We also discussed the impact of ionizing radiation from Chernobyl accident on pregnancy and congenital defects occurrence. Changes following the Chernobyl accident, as the inhabitants migration from contaminated regions, political and economic conversions, led to depression, anxiety, and even to \"epidemic\" of mental diseases. Increased suicide rate, car accidents, alcohol and drug abuse have been observed in this population. Nowadays vegetative neurosis is more often diagnosed in Ukrainian children.

Extremely rare (&lt; 1% of cases) acromegaly can be a result of ectopic GHRH (growth hormone releasing hormone) secretion by bronchial tubes, lung, pancreatic or intestinal tumor. The aim of this description is to present the case of successfully treated acromegaly caused by ectopic GHRH secretion by bronchial neuroendocrine tumor and the usefulness of chromogranin A assay in the disease monitoring. The diagnosis of acromegaly in 61-year old woman was based on typical clinical picture and elevated GH and IGF-1(insulin-like growth factor-1) levels. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images revealed no tumor in the pituitary but only the pituitary enlargement. Moreover, the right lung tumor (10 cm size) and elevated GHRH level were documented. The secretion of GH, IGF-1 and GHRH were normalized and progression of acromegaly was stopped after the carcinoid tumor surgery. Currently, 5 year after surgery, acromegaly is still in the remission, as the normal levels of GH, IGF-1, chromogranin A and normal chest and pituitary images confirm. The authors emphasize usefulness of measurement of chromogranin A concentration for the evaluation of the tumor remission in case the routine GHRH assay is not accessible.","1312":"The II generation method using human recombination thyrotropin receptors for measurement of thyrotropin binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII) is characterized by increased sensitivity and specificity in comparison with I generation method. AIM OF STUDY was to determine, whether TBII levels measured with II generation assay reflect thyroid stimulation and whether measurement of thyroid stimulating antibodies (TSI) could be replaced by TBII determinations. Specific aim was to evaluate, whether correlation between TSI and TBII levels is stable during antithyroid therapy. 41 patients with the newly diagnosed Graves' disease were included in the study. TSI (cAMP levels in CHO cell line) and TBII (II generation assay) levels were determined before treatment and after 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of thiamazol therapy. Moreover, thyroid blocking antibodies were determined after 12 months of treatment. 32 patients (82.05%) had positive basic TSI level and 35 patients (89.74%) had positive basic TBII level. After 12 months of therapy negative level of TSI was observed in 67.57% of patients and negative level of TBII was founded in 45.85% of patients. Correlation between TSI and TBII levels was positive during treatment course except time after 9 months of therapy. TBII level is adequate parameter to assess thyroid stimulation intensity. Positive correlation between TSI and TBII levels is present during almost whole treatment course. TBII seems to be reliable parameter in disease activity monitoring and response to therapy.

Recently it has become evident that adiponectin and leptin secreted by adipose tissue may be involved in the pathophysiology of MS. was to assess the effects of the menopause on the relationships between adiponectin and leptin and different cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. A total of 56 postmenopausal women and 75 premenopausal subjects were enrolled in this study. We measured blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference and WHR, triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (cHDL) levels and fasting glucose and applied the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Women were categorised as having 0, 1, 2, 3 or more risk factors. The presence of at least 3 abnormalities was defined as MS. Serum was assayed for adiponectin and leptin by the radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. A decline in adiponectin was related to an increased number of MS variables in postmenopausal and premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women with MS had significantly lower adiponectin concentrations than premenopausal women with MS. Serum adiponectin concentrations were inversely correlated to leptin in postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women no clear relationships were found between serum leptin and the number of metabolic disturbances. In contrast to young women, postmenopausal women showed an increase in leptin secretion with a growing number of MS elements. Compared to premenopausal women with MS, postmenopausal women with MS had higher levels of leptin. We found associations between leptin and different risk factors, mainly in the postmenopausal group. When the presence of MS was used as a dependent variable (yes\/no) and adiponectin, leptin and menopause status as independent factors, adiponectin and leptin remained significant variables related to MS. The significant role of adiponectin in the pathophysiology of MS in premenopausal and postmenopausal women is confirmed in this study. Leptin is correlated with several MS components but this adipocytokine appears to play a role only in postmenopausal women. ","1314":"The aim of the study was to demonstrate whether pinealectomy and long-term MEL administration can affect bone metabolism (as evaluated on the basis of serum concentrations of PICP and ICTP) in orchidectomized rats. The study included 248 adult male Wistar rats; 6 remained intact, 120 were orchidectomized (Orch), and the remaining ones underwent a sham operation (SOrch). Two weeks after surgery, the rats were divided into 8 groups: 1) SOrch + SPx; 2) SOrch + SPx + MEL; 3) Orch + SPx; 4) Orch + SPx + MEL; 5) SOrch + Px; 6) SOrch + Px + MEL; 7) Orch + Px; 8) Orch + Px + MEL. Animals from 5(th), 6(th), 7(th) and 8(th) groups were pinealectomized (Px) while the remaining ones underwent a sham operation (SPx). Two weeks after surgery rats in the 2(nd), 4(th), 6(th) and 8(th) groups were administered MEL (50 microg\/100 g of bm) intraperitoneally while the remaining animals were administered solvent only (daily between 5 and 6 pm during a month). The animals were decapitated before the experiment (intact rats), after 2 weeks from Orch and SOrch, Px and SPx, after 4 weeks from MEL or solvent administration and after 4 and 8 weeks from discontinuing administration of MEL, and blood was collected for PICP and ICTP concentrations assays with the use of RIA method. In Orch rats, a distinct tendency to increase the studied bone markers, especially ICTP was shown. Pinealectomy had inducing, while MEL suppressing effect upon the level of PICP and ICTP; these changes were more pronounced in Orch + Px and SOrch + Px + MEL groups, respectively. After discontinuing administration of MEL distinct tendency to increase of PICP and ICTP level was shown. Our findings indicate that MEL is an important modulator of bone tissue metabolism in male rats and that deficiency of MEL concentration may be a co-factor in osteoporosis development.

The pineal glands of 2-month-old male Syrian hamsters were examined. The animals were divided into the following groups of four animals each: group 1 - melatonin treatment; group 2 - N-acetylserotonin treatment; group 3 - 6-hydroxymelatonin treatment (all substances given subcutaneously at doses of 25 microg per animal between 16.00 and 17.00 h daily for seven weeks). Group 4 was given solvent treatment only and served as controls. The animals were killed by decapitation between 09:00 and 10.00 h. Routine electron microscopical techniques were used to obtain quantitative data on pinealocyte ultrastructure. Melatonin administration did not influence the size of the hamster pinealocytes, whereas administration of N-acetylserotonin and 6-hydroxymelatonin caused a significant reduction in cell size in comparison to the melatonin-treated and control groups. There were changes in the relative volumes of the mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes in the pinealocytes of the studied groups, while the volumes of granular endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets were unchanged. The dense-core vesicles were more numerous in the pinealocytes of the melatonin and 6-hydroxymelatonin-treated groups in comparison to those of animals treated with N-acetylserotonin or the controls. The changes observed in the ultrastructure of hamster pinealocytes indicate that administration of melatonin as well as of its precursor or metabolite influences the morphology of these cells and also, perhaps, their secretory activity.

Identification of RET mutation implies further steps of diagnostic procedure, some of them - USG, FNAB and calcitonin level tests - are common for all types of mutation, other are related to ascertained type of mutation. In asymptomatic RET mutation carriers, prophylactic thyroidectomy is indicated. In MEN2B inherited cancer reveals its symptoms quickly and shows dynamic progress. In MEN2A\/FMTC the clinical picture is diversified - in some patients the course of disease is mild, however in some other cases the progression of disease and even death occur regardless of the proper treatment. Unfortunately, there are no molecular prognostic markers in medullary thyroid carcinoma. Recent papers and also our own unpublished results show that gene expression profile, is similar in MEN2A and sporadic cancer. This group differs from MEN2B by its expression profile. In conclusion it is to be emphasized that although inherited medullary thyroid carcinoma is a rare disease, the diagnostic algorithm is well established and maximizes the chance for early diagnosis. Moreover, it needs to be stressed that DNA analysis results inform us not only about the necessity of further therapy, but also suggest different ways of proceeding in particular type of mutation.","1318":"Among the causes of premature ovarian failure (POF) two groups of factors are reported: factors which lead to decrease of follicular number and factors which stimulate follicular atresia. In the first group genetic factors are the most important whereas in the second: enzymatic autoimmunological, iatrogenic, toxins and infections are reported. In 1986 familiar POF on the background of long arm of chromosome X deletion was reported. Other chromosomes which are important for normal ovarian function are: chromosome 21 (AIRE gene), chromosome 11 (gene of beta FSH, ATM gene), chromosome 3 (gene responsible for BEPS syndrome) and chromosome 2 (genes of FSH and LH receptors).

Those techniques are based on an antigen-antibody reaction and visualization of its product in microscopic examination. The precursor of this new diagnostic procedure was an immunofluorescent reaction in frozen tissue samples performed by Albert Coons in 1940. Then the immunohistochemical techniques were perfected to increase sensitivity and specificity. Currently it is hard to imagine a modern pathological examination without immunohistochemistry. At the end of XXth century it was believed that 75% of cases is possible to be diagnosed due to immunohistochemical stains. Microscopic examination of endocrine glands tissue samples is extremely difficult because of coexistence of the presence of neoplasms and endocrine dysfunction. It is necessary to establish the type of hormones in the cells of the endocrine system lesions to make a proper diagnosis. Thanks to the use of antibodies against hormones and its precursors it becomes possible. At present most of the antigens are easily detected in both: formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues samples and ethanol fixed cytological smears so immunohistochemocal and immunocytological stains can be a part of routine diagnostic procedures in pathology. However most of the biologically active substances are revealed in many organs and tissues and it is necessary to perform a satisfactory immunohistochemical panel to be sure the diagnosis. It is important to notice that there is no need to make a wide panel of antibodies in all of the cases and the economical aspect of examination is also important. Of course immunohistochemistry sometimes is the guarantee of proper diagnosis but in some cases too wide panel of antibodies can be a loss for the patient and for medical department. We discussed the proper diagnostic procedures and immunohistochemical profile in pathological lesions of endocrine system (thyroid and adrenal gland, adenohypophysis, neuroendocrine tumours and some hormones-secreting tumours of gonads).","1321":"According to classic theory of neogenesis, cancer arises from well-differentiated cell that in response to variety of factors de-differentiates, becomes able to proliferate without control and\/or loses its ability to undergo apoptosis. According to another theory, cancers (at least cancers of some organs) originate from stem cells, which \"by definition\" are poorly differentiated and able to proliferate indefinitely. Therefore a lower number of abnormal events is necessary for these cells to escape proliferation-controlling mechanisms. With regard to papillary thyroid cancers it is still thought that it arises from well-differentiated thyreocyte. One of the characteristic features of cancer cell is chromosomal instability. Lowest number of such abnormalities is observed in well-differentiated thyroid cancers (including papillary cancer), intermediate - in poorly-differentiated cancers, while highest - in anaplastic cancers. Microarray analysis shows that despite of clinical heterogeneity, gene expression profiles of papillary cancers are very similar. Genetic anomalies predisposing to the development of papillary cancer most commonly regard proteins that possess kinase activity. Kinases phosphorylate other proteins, and play an extremely important role in signal transduction from outside the cell as well as inside the cell. Constitutive activation of some kinases may lead to the excessive and\/or permanent activation of some transduction pathways specific for mitogens or growth factors. This results in excessive proliferation. The best known protein of such type which function is altered in papillary thyroid cancers is RET - a membrane-located growth factor-receptor with kinase activity. RET gene undergoes different rearrangements in this type of cancer. There are approximately 10 RET rearrangements known, with RET\/PTC3 and RET\/PTC1 being most common. In this anomaly kinase domain-encoding 3' end of RET gene is aberrantly bound to 5' end of another gene. Fusion protein synthesized on such hybrid template is not present in the cell membrane but in the cytoplasm, where it permanently activates transduction pathway specific for RET. NTRK1 gene encoding a member of family of neuronal growth factor receptors containing thyrosine kinase domain is also rearranged in papillary cancers. However, genes fused to its kinase domain-encoding sequence are different from the ones fused to RET. MET, a gene encoding another membrane protein with thyrosine kinase activity, which acts as a growth factor-receptor, is overexpressed in 70%-90% of papillary thyroid cancers. BRAF gene encoding another yet kinase transducing signals from RAS and RAF to the cell is mutated at position 1796 (T\/A, amino acid substitution V599E) in 38-69% of papillary cancers. The presence of this activatory mutation is associated with higher degree of clinical advancement of the disease. In addition, in majority of papillary cancers tested, mutations of the genes encoding nuclear triiodothyronine receptors were found. Transgenic mice with both TRB allele replaced with dominant-negative TRB mutants develop aggressive thyroid cancers. Progression from papillary to anaplastic cancer is most possibly caused by the occurrence of additional anomalies within P53, RAS, NM23,b-catenin gene and other genes.","1322":"Pituitary adenomas are common benign neoplasms, accounting for approximately 15% of intracranial tumors. In systematic autopsy, pituitary tumors are found in 25%, of the population, but only one-third of these tumors give rise to clinical manifestations. Why most of these neoplasms remain undiagnosed and pituitary carcinomas are extremely rare? The progress in the studies concerning pituitary tumorigenesis is rather slow and, due to several limitations, including the anatomic inaccessibility of human pituitary gland, the lack of functional human cell lines in culture and the discrepancies between human and animal pituitary oncogenesis (in rodents pituitary hyperplasia is a prerequisite for adenoma development). In humans, the majority of pituitary tumors are monoclonal in origin and derived from single mutated pituicyte, rarely hyperplasia is a prerequisite for adenoma formation. As in the case of other tumors, activating mutations in oncogenes (GNAS1, PTTG) and inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes (MEN1, CNC1) lead to pituitary tumors development. However, mutations in classic oncogenes are very rarely associated with these tumors. Moreover, the important role of some hypothalamic hormones, peripheral hormones and their receptors (e.g. GHRH, dopamine D2 receptor, PRL receptor, estrogens, thyroid hormone receptor) and growth factors (e.g. FGF, EGF, TGF) is postulated and partially proved in promotion of pituitary tumorigenesis. Further studies are required to determine which of these events are truly primary changes in pituitary tumorigenesis, what may allow development of gene therapy.","1323":"Current views on the molecular aspects of familial parathyroid gland diseases have been presented (familial primary hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism and psuedohypoparathyroidism).

Localization, structure, expression and structural changes (mutations) found in patients with familial parathyroid gland diseases have been presented. Attention has been paid to clinical and histopathologic symptoms, which should indicate the need to undertake genetic studies.","1324":"Classical action of steroid hormones, called genomic, includes binding to their intracellular receptor, require hours or days to occur and require transcriptional effects with subsequent modulation of protein expression. Some of the biological effects induced by steroids, and mainly by sex steroids, take place within seconds or few minutes, time far too fast to be due to the genomic changes. The rapid, nongenomic action of estradiol are attributed to membrane action, probably through variety of proteins present in cell membrane. The rapid effects of steroid hormones are manifold, ranging from activation of protein and tyrosine kinases, G proteins, and modulation of ion channels. The nongenomic way of action includes also non-direct control of processes of transcription and gene expression. There are at least three different way to interact with cell membrane. Steroids may change membrane fluidity, without binding to any known protein or receptor. Another way is allosteric modulation of non-specific for steroid hormones receptors, or structural and enzymatic protein present in cell membrane. Evidence suggests that the classical steroid receptors can be localized at the plasma membrane, triggering signals typical for G-proteins coupled receptors. Physiological significance of nongenomic action of steroids needs to be elucidated.","1325":"Estradiol (E2) is traditionally recognised as the female sex hormone. It has been believed for 40 years, that E2 didn't exert any influence or caused impairment of the gonadal function in men. The main source of E2 in men is adipose tissue and the brain. E2 is also produced in adrenals, liver, mammary glands, hair and in male gonad. Daily production and the level of E2 in the blood in men are higher than those in postmenopausal women. At the end of the 80-ties we were first reporting that during sexual maturation E2 can be the important hormonal signal for the initiation of spermatogenesis. The traditional view about unimportant or inhibitory role of E2 in male physiology was finally refuted thanks to discovering estrogen receptors in males. In the 90-ties, transgenic mice with the lack of estrogen receptor (ER) or gene encoding enzyme aromatase, that enable the conversion of testosterone into E2, were also produced. Observations of men with inherited mutations of these genes, considerably extended our knowledge about E2 in men in stroma bones formation, inhibition of their growing, lipids metabolism and sexual maturation, the effects that were attributed to testosterone action until today. New data also points at important role of estrogens and ER in the function of the cardio-vascular system and in counteracting coronary disease in men.","1326":"Atypical endometrial hyperplasia has been associated with progression to endometrial cancer, the most common genital malignancy. There are multiple risk factors for endometrial cancer, such as early menarche, exogenous estrogen exposure, obesity and diabetes. Diabetics have a 3-4 fold relative risk of endometrial cancer. Also, several studies have demonstrated an association between insulin resistance and endometrial cancer. There is known the first description of atypical endometrial hyperplasia resistant to progestogen therapy, which was subsequently treated with an insulin-sensitizng agent, metformin. Metformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent used in the treatment of adult-onset diabetes. Unlike the sulfonylureas, metformin does not act primarily by increasing insulin secretion. In contrast, metformin lowers the rate of gluconeogenesis in the presence of insulin. Therefore, it is considered an insulin-sensitizer. Increased insulin sensitivity may improve the metabolic effect of insulin and decrease its mitogenic effect by tissue-specific mechanisms. One explanation for tissue specific differences in insulin binding and action may be through the relative expression of the insulin receptor (IR) isoforms. The IR isoforms IR-A and IR-D differ by 12 amino acid residues, owing to the alternative splicing of exon. The IR-A is predominantly expressed in malignant tissues and may lead to mitogenic effects within the cell. The relative expressions of IR-A and IR-B in normal and malignant endometrial tissue is not known. Besides direct effects on the IR, several additional mechanisms have been proposed for the mitogenic effect of insulin in endometrial cancer. In addition to the possible direct mitogenic effects of insulin through the IR-A, insulin resistance may be associated with alterations in expression of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and the IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) or may inhibit the protective effect of progestagens. Binding sites for IGF-1 and IGF-2 have been confirmed in both normal and malignant endometrium. Binding of IGF-1 is significantly higher in endometrial cancer compared to normal endometrium. In the Ishikawa human endometrial cancer cell line IGF-1 was a more potent mitogen than insulin or IGF-2. Insulin may increase mitogenicity by regulating the expression of IGFBPs. The IGFBPs are a family of proteins that have both proliferative and anti-proliferative effects. While all six high-affinity IGFBPs are expressed in the endometrium, IGFBP-1 is the best characterized. Hyperinsulinemia can decrease IGFBP-1 even in the presence of progesterone, perhaps inhibiting progesterone's protective effects. Interestingly, IGFBP-1 was undetectable or minimally expressed in endometrial cancers. Nestler discussed results of a 6-month treatment of 100 nonebese women with PCOS, which showed a somewhat greater effect of metformin than rosiglitazone and no benefit of administering both agents in combination. Long-term treatment with oral contraceptives decreases endometrial cancer, with a reduction in serum androgens and a decreases in hirsutism and acne, but may worsen insulin resistance and lead to deteriration in glucose tolerance. Insulin sensitizers, on the other hand, should decrease endometrial hyperplasia by inducing regular menses, but may not be as beneficial in improving androgen - related symptoms. Note that the Nurses Health Study (NHS) showed increased risk of diabetes in oral contraceptive users. These considerations may be related to the finding that women who used oral contraceptives have increased risk of myocardial infarction. Thus, in view of the particular increase in CVD risk among women with PCOS, one might be less likely to recommend oral contraceptives, while insulin sensitizers may be of particular benefit, decreasing androgens, improving ovulation and fertility, and reducing the risk of diabetes and CVD. Theoretically, metformin, a treatment which is now widely used to treat infertile women with PCOS, may have a role in preventing endometrial hyperstimulation by lowering insulin concentrations and restoring ovulation. However, the long-term effects of this drug in women with PCOS are not known and more studies are required before suggesting its use for preventing endometrial cancer.","1327":"MEN 1 syndrome (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by the association of tumors in several endocrine glands, mainly in parathyroids, gut and pituitary. At our institution in the years 1982-2004 we have followed 26 patients with MEN 1 syndrome belonging to 19 families. The diagnosis of MEN 1 was based on Gubbio Consensus (JCEM 86: 5658-5671, 2001). Mean age at the diagnosis of MEN 1 was 35 years. Primary hyperparathyroidism was the most frequent pathology, which was diagnosed in 25 of 26 patients (96%). Gut endocrine tumors were found in 20 patients (77%), while pituitary tumors in 18 (70%). Non-functioning gut tumors were most frequent (n=9), followed by insulinoma (n=7) and gastrinoma (n=4). Prolactinoma was the most frequent pituitary tumor found in 12 patients (67%). Three patients died during the observation period - all of them of generalized gut endocrine tumor (gastrinoma in 2 cases and foregut carcinoid in one case). The management of MEN 1 is not easy and careful analysis of clinical picture is necessary in each individual case. Several important observations can be made on the basis of own experience and the literature: 1. In each sporadic pathology, which may be a part of MEN 1, one should consider. the possibility of MEN 1. The individual MEN 1 abnormalities are often diagnosed after 40 and later 2. MEN 1 tumor are usually multiple thus necessitating a different therapeutic approach (more radical surgery) 3. The most valuable screening tests are: Ca++, PP, CgA and prolactin 4. Endoscopic ultrasound is the most specific method for the localization of pancreatic endocrine tumors. 5. The results of surgical treatment of MEN 1 tumors are worse than that of sporadic tumors. 6. Prognosis in MEN 1 is determined by the behaviour of gut neuroendocrine tumor 7. No genotype\/phenotype correlation in MEN 1 syndrome was found so far. In summary, it should be underlined that MEN 1 syndrome is an endocrine disorder, in which early diagnosis and optimal treatment may significantly improve the prognosis.","1328":"The paper presents gene expression profile analysis with DNA microarrays and compares two core technological platforms used for this purpose - high density oligonucleotide microarrays and cDNA microarrays. With this background recent results of papillary thyroid carcinoma analysis with DNA microarrays are presented.","1329":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common heterogenous endocrine disorder associated with amenorrhoea (or oligomenorrhoea), hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, obesity, insulin resistance, and an approximately 7-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM - non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus). It is a leading cause of female infertility. The prevalence of PCOS among reproductive-age women has been estimated at 4%-12%. Familial aggregation of this syndrome is well established. There are also ethnic and racial variations in the prevalence of the syndrome and its symptoms. Multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Several genes from these pathways have been tested include genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism (StAR, CYP11, CYP17, CYP19 HSD17B1-3, HSD3B1-2), gonadotropin and gonadal hormones action (ACTR1, ACTR2A-B, FS, INHA, INHBA-B, INHC, SHBG, LHCGR, FSHR, MADH4, AR), obesity and energy regulation (MC4R, OB, OBR, POMC, UCP2-3), insulin secretion and action (IGF1, IGF1R, IGFBPI1-3, INS VNTR, IR, INSL, IRS1-2, PPARG) and many others. Most women with PCOS, both obese and lean, have a degree of insulin resistance. The minisatellite of insulin gene (INS VNTR), especially class III alleles and III\/III genotypes might not only determine the predisposition to anovulatory PCOS but also the concomitant risk for development of type 2 diabetes. The function of the insulin receptor (IR) is probably normal in woman with PCOS. However abnormal serine phosphorylation in the receptor may impair signal transduction accounting for a post-binding defect in insulin action. Serine phosphorylation is also involved in the postranslational regulation of 17,20-lyase activity (CYP17). There may be a common aetiology for both insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. Polymorphic alleles of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 (insulin receptor substrate 1 - 2), alone or in combination, may have a functional impact on the insulin-resistant component of PCOS. There is no evidence to suggest that follistatin gene polymorphisms play a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in PCOS women. PCOS appears to be associated with the absence of the four-repeat-units allele in a polymorphic region of pentanucleotide (TTTTA)n repeats within CYP11A gene, which encodes cytochrome P450scc. It has been hypothesized that up-regulation of this enzyme could lead to increased androgen production. There is no evidence of any association of alleles of CYP19 gene (encoding cytochrome P450arom) with PCOS. Association exists between androgen receptor gene (AR) polymorphisms an androgens action in PCOS. Increased hirustism and decreased CAG repeat length within AR gene has been also demonstrated in women with normal testosterone levels. Expression of estrogen receptor (ERs) as well as 5-alpha-reeducates (SRD5A1-2 genes) activity was analysed in granulosa (GC) and theca cells (TC). The results of this study demonstrate that there are significant alterations in the expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in PCOS that may be related to abnormal follicular development. On the other hand elevated SRD5A activity in polycystic ovaries supported the hypothesis that 5-alpha-reduced androgens may play a role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. The genetic aetiology of PCOS remains unknown. There are a number of interlinking factors that affects expression of PCOS. Single cause of PCOS is unlikely. Other possible mechanisms in pathogenesis of PCOS are discussed.","1330":"The aim of this review is to present the up-to-date information concerning the prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is a benign, unilateral or bilateral enlargement of the male breast due to the imbalance between the androgens and estrogens at the breast tissue level. This clinical condition is particularly common in boys during puberty and in aging men. The breast enlargement, especially with accompanying pain can cause serious psychological problem. At the present time there are no generally accepted procedures for the evaluation and treatment of patients with gynecomastia. In the article such recommendations were proposed. There are many studies conducted to find the safe and efficient medical therapy that could ameliorate the quality of life of the patients with gynecomastia. The information on the available treatment options were also presented.","1331":"The aim of the study was to assess influence of hyperthyroidism and glucocorticosteroid treatment on changes of bone turnover markers in patients with Graves' disease and thyroid ophthalmopathy (TO). Three groups of patients were included in the study. Group I was composed of 26 euthyroid Graves' disease patients with TO suitable for steroid treatment. Group II included 14 hyperthyroid Graves' patients without TO treated medically with anti-thyroid drugs. Group III (control group) included 20 healthy volunteers. Levels of the bone formation marker, i.e. bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and the bone resorption marker, i.e. deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were measured in the group I before steroid treatment administration, after 3 methylprednisolone i.v. pulses and after completing the oral prednisone treatment. In the group II levels of BALP and DPD were assessed twice: before treatment of hyperthyroidism and after 6 months since euthyroid state had been achieved. In the group III levels of BALP and DPD were measured once in the basal conditions. Mean initial levels of BALP in groups I and II did not differ significantly and were increased when compared to healthy volunteers. In the group I a transient significant decrease in BALP levels after 3 i.v. pulses of methylprednisolone was observed, followed by a significant increase in BALP after completing the oral prednisone therapy. The achievement of euthyroid state in Graves' patients (II) did not influence significantly BALP values. In the group I initial DPD levels were significantly lower than those in group II and higher than those in the control group (III). During steroid treatment of TO (group I) no dynamic changes of DPD levels were observed. The achievement of euthyroid state in group II was accompanied by a significant decrease in DPD levels, which were however than those in the control group. 1. In hyperthyroid state is associated with the profound stimulation of bone resorption, and to a lesser extent of bone formation. 2. The achievement of euthyroid state causes a rapid inhibition of bone resorption and maintains a compensatory stimulation of bone formation. 3. Glucocorticosteroid treatment with methylprednisolone i.v. pulses and orally administered prednisone do not influence significantly the processes of bone formation and bone resorption. ","1332":"Neoangiogenesis is a significant event in a cascade of growth and progression of solid tumors. Assessment of the tissue expression and measurement of the concentrations of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, contributing to this process, in body fluids, can be used not only for an early diagnosis of tumors and their staging but also as an important parameter of treatment efficiency evaluation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the concentrations of crucial angiogenic cytokine VEGF and its soluble receptors in peripheral blood of patients with benign and malignant thyroid tumors. The study comprised 35 patients with thyroid cancer and 10 patients with follicular neoplasm, both diagnosed by means of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. For these patients surgical treatment was instituted. The examined angiogenic factors were determined preoperatively and 4 weeks after the surgical procedures. The results were compared with the control group which comprised 10 healthy individuals. Analysing obtained results, we demonstrated high VEGF concentrations and low soluble VEGF receptor concentrations in patients with benign and malignant thyroid tumors. This fact confirms a vital role of VEGF in angiogenesis of thyroid tumors and a hypothetical antiangiogenic activity of its soluble receptors. Disequilibrium of the above-mentioned angiogenic factor concentrations is probably essential for the growth and progression of benign and malignant thyroid tumors.","1333":"In Poland treatment with growth hormone of adolescent patients dates back to 1964. Till 1993 the therapy was conducted in an interrupted manner, depending on the periodic availability of the drug. The data form such forms of therapy suggested that the end height within 3rd centile was achieved only by a portion of treated patients. Since 1995 the growth hormone is used in continuous therapy, which allows to sum up the effects of the therapy, including the growth rate and end height. A total of 117 children and adolescent of both sexes, aged 4.6 to 18.1 years, with diagnosed somatotropic or multihormonal pituitary insufficiency were included in the study. All of them were treated with growth hormone and had an analysis of growth rate and end height. In the first 6 months of growth hormone treatment the growth rate achieved 10.4 cm\/year in boys and 10.0 in girls and showed no correlation with maturation status. In the second half of the year the growth rate declined slightly. During the remainder of the therapy the growth rate markedly declined, and this effect was most notable in girls. In 93% of patients after the end of therapy the final height was no different than the expected height. 1. The growth rate in first half a year of the treatment was 3 times higher than before the beginning of therapy. 2. In the second half of the first year the growth rate slightly declined. 3. In following years the growth rate declined notably. 4. The final achieved height in most of the patients does not differ from the prognosed height. ","1334":"Epidemiological studies suggest a protective influence of obesity against postmenopausal bone loss. Lower risk of osteoporotic fractures was described in obese patients. However there were only a few studies which examined the effect of weight reduction on bone metabolism and results of these studies are controversial. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of weight reduction program using Orlistat on bone metabolism in perimenopausal women. Twenty obese women with simple obesity and without concomitant diseases (BMI 37.1 +\/- 3.0 kg\/m2, mean age 49.8 +\/- 4.6 yrs) were enrolled into this study. The control group consisted of 20 healthy women (mean age 53.5 +\/- 5.4 yrs, BMI 24.1 +\/- 2.2 kg\/m2). All patients have participated in a 3-month weight reduction therapy that consisted of: a 1000-1200 kcal\/ day balanced diet (daily calcium consumption about 500mg), Orlistat 3 x 120mg a day and regular physical exercises. Before the weight reduction therapy and after 10% reduction of body weight, serum concentrations of PTH, 25-(OH)-D3, total calcium and phosphorus, total cholesterol were assessed. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA method) of lumbar spine and femoral neck, measuring BMD was performed once, after a 3-month weight reduction therapy using Lunar DPXL. All these measurements were performed only once in control subjects. After a 3-month weight reduction program in patients treated with Orlistat the mean weight loss was 11.6 +\/- 5.1 kg which is 12.1 +\/- 4.78 %. BMI decreased from 37.1 +\/- 3.0 kg\/m2 at baseline to 32.6 +\/- 2.7 kg\/m2 post-treatment. The body weight reduction resulted in significant decrease of body fat and total cholesterol concentration. In obese subjects serum concentration of 25-(OH)-D3 was significantly lower and serum concentration of PTH was significantly higher in comparison to healthy controls, both before and after weight reduction therapy. Serum concentration of PTH, 25-(OH)-D3, total calcium and phosphorus did not change significantly after therapy with Orlistat. 3-month weight reduction program using Orlistat did not influence significantly bone metabolism.

Identification and evaluation of individual bone fracture risk will be the most effective way of solving the problem. Genetic determination of osteoporosis is unquestionable. The aim of this study is to detect which variants of genotypes lead to illness. We investigated 187 patients with osteoporosis (161 women, 26 men) and 19 healthy subjects. Polymorphisms of the following genes were investigated: OPG, VDR, ESR1, TGFB1 COL1A1, and BMP2. The statistically significant relationship between BMD value and T allele of Taq I VDR gene were found. Genotypes: aa, bb, TT of VDR gene occur more frequently in polish osteoporotic population in Wielkopolska region within patients with higher risk of bone fractures.","1336":"Complete androgenic blockade used in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma can be attained by administration of antiandrogens in orchidectomized patients or by combined therapy with LH-RH analogs and antiandrogens. The treatment, however, decreases the influence of both androgens end estrogens on bone tissue and may result in bone mass loss and increased propensity to fractures. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of complete androgenic blockade on bone mass and skeletal metabolism in men with advanced prostatic carcinoma and to assess whether 1alpha-OH vitamin D3 (1alpha-OHD3) together with calcium supplementation is able to prevent bone mass loss in men treated with complete androgenic blockade. 51 patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma, with skeletal metastases, aged 44 - 86, mean 68 ys were included into a 12-month prospective study. All patients were treated with orchidectomy followed by therapy with flutamide in a dose of 750 mg daily. 26 patients were additionally given 1alpha-OHD3 in a dose of 0.5 microg\/d and calcium carbonate in an initial dose of 1 g daily. It was found that the 12-month treatment with complete androgenic blockade resulted in a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) by 8.1% in the lumbar spine, by 6.3% in the femoral neck and by 3.5% in the total skeleton. Therapy with 1alpha-OHD3 and CaCO3 caused complete inhibition of bone tissue loss in the lumbar spine and resulted in an increase in BMD by 2.2% in femoral neck and by 1.9% in the total skeleton. None of the examined patients experienced any skeletal fractures. In both groups of patients a prompt decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase activity - a marker of osteoblast activity and an increase in fasting urine calcium creatinine ratio indicating acceleration of bone resorption were found. in patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma treated with complete androgenic blockade acceleration of bone mass loss is observed; treatment with 1alpha-OHD3 and CaCO3 is able to prevent both trabecular and compact bone loss.

This increased risk for premature atherosclerosis is supported by autopsy and epidemiological studies in patients with thyroid hormone deficiency. Hypothyroid patients have increased diastolic blood pressure (as a result of increased systemic vascular resistance), altered lipid profile (elevated levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B). More recently homocysteine, C-reactive protein, increased arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction and altered coagulation parameters have been recognized as a \"new\" risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with thyroid hormone deficiency. The plasma total homocysteine concentration, an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, is moderately elevated in overtly hypothyroid patients and it decreases with thyroid replacement therapy. Several experimental study have shown that hypothyroidism affects folate metabolism and the enzymes involved in the remetylation pathway of homocysteine (particularly 5,10-methylenotetrahydrofolate reductase - MTHFR). In hypothyroid condition the hepatic activity of flavoenzyme - MTHFR, is decreased. Thyroid hormone may affect the availability of FMN and FAD - necessary for stabilizing MTHFR. An impairment of enzyme involved in transsulfuration pathway is suggested. The increased serum creatinine level in hypothyroidism probably reflects a reduced glomerular filtration rate, which is linked to impaired renal homocysteine clearance and hyperhomocysteinemia.","1340":"Thyroid hormones play the essential role in the regulation of metabolism and bone remodeling in physiological conditions and in the course of thyroid dysfunction. Introduction of densitometry to the diagnostics of osteoporosis has made possible the evaluation of influence of both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and their treatment on bone mineral density. Moreover it became possible to estimate the influence of treatment with exogenous thyroid hormones on the skeletal system. Authors presented mechanisms of the thyroid hormones action on bone tissue and analysed current state of knowledge concerning the influence of the thyroxine treatment with replacement and suppressive doses on the bone mineral density. The influence of thyroid hormones on the skeletal system with respect to premenopausal and postmenopausal period was also discussed. Great discrepancies in literature data and its reasons were underlined.","1341":"TNF-alpha is one with mediators insulin resistance.

For further evaluation we qualified 4 patients, 1 female and 3 males, aged: 60, 43, 42 and 64 years, with clinical activity score equal 4, with duration of Graves' ophthalmopathy of mean 2.1 years (0.16 - 5.5). Included were patients with movement restrictions in vertical plane and echographic findings of isolated extraocular muscle involvement (inferior rectus). Each of the patients received 20 mg 6-alpha-methylprednisolone into the muscle belly of inferior rectus, in one case injection was done in both eyes. In all cases we were able to archive lessening of the intraocular pressure in secondary position, with slight improvement in ocular motility and bigger range of duction free of diplopia.

","1343":"Total thyroidectomy with lymphadenectomy is the most typical operation in a case of papillary thyroid cancer. Range of lymph node resection still remains a matter of controversy. In some publications treatment of lymph node metastases doesn't affect survival, so only selective lymph node resection is the extended enough operation. The others remark that, local relapse- the worst prognostic factor, appears the most often in the lymph nodes, so they suggest more aggressive treatment. To solve that problem we try to find more sensitive methods to examine lymph nodes. To compare the results of detection lymph node metastases of papillary thyroid cancer by immunohistochemistry with the results of RT- PCR for thyroglobulin (Tg) mRNA. Each of one hundred eighty four cervical lymph nodes obtained from 24 patients, operated in our Department was divided into 2 halves: one was used for conventional histopathology and immunohistochemistry, the other part was investigated by RT- PCR for Tg mRNA. Immunohistochemical staining for Tg was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections with anti-Tg antibodies. According to routine, histopathological examination 8 (33.5%) patients had involved lymph nodes. One hundred correspondence of the results of immunohistochemistry and histopathology was observed. We obtained different results of examination of the lymph nodes in 6 (25%) patients. In four patients (16.7%) RT-PCR was more sensitive in detection of positive lymph nodes, in two patients (8.3%) it revealed less metastasized lymph nodes than immunohistochemistry. The remaining 18 patients didn't have any differences, fourteen (58.3%) of them had the negative lymph nodes and four (16.7%) had positive, the same lymph nodes in all examinations. Finally, according to RT-PCR 10 (41.7%) of the patients had metastasized lymph nodes.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of osteoporotic vertebral fractures and risk factors for osteoporosis in a random sample of Szczecin inhabitants aged over 50 in the relation to the whole European population examined in the frame of EVOS (European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study) and its prospective phase - EPOS (European Prospective Osteoporosis Study). At the baseline, 607 persons were studied, including 301 women and 306 men. Material and methods The questionnaire on the risk factors for osteoporosis and the spine X-rays analysed by morphometry, were taken in all subjects. The incidence of osteoporotic vertebral deformity in the studied population was similar in both sexes (12.6% women and 10,3% men) but in men aged 50-64 fracture incidence was significantly higher in comparison with women. The prevalence of new vertebral fractures examined after 4 years was higher in women than in men (9.1 vs 6.4\/1000 persons years). Among the risk factors for osteoporosis, low physical activity and prolonged immobilization in women significantly influenced the incidence of vertebral deformities. 1) The study shows the high incidence of risk factors and osteoporotic vertebral deformities in the population of Szczecin inhabitants aged over 50. 2) Visual assessment only with a combination with morphometry is an optimal tool for detection of incident vertebral fractures.

The mean total BMD gain (deltaBMD) was 20% and the most significant increase was observed after the first (7.5%) and the second (6.6%) year of the therapy. Before the start and during EP treatment E2 levels were evaluated: they increased from 9.2pg\/ml to the values observed in the controls (C) but positive correlation with BMD was not observed. Analysis of TS patients in age brackets (&lt;15 years, 15-20 years, 21-25 years, &gt;25 years) showed that only in the group that started EP treatment before the age of 15 every year significant deltaBMD was observed. The group that started EP therapy after the age of 20 didn't achieve significant deltaBMD. Patients wit TS had significantly higher levels of bone metabolism markers (Ntx and BALP) than the controls and in both groups negative correlation with age was found. On the basis of the results the conclusion was made that in hypoestrogenic women, not exclusively TS, the age when estrogen therapy is started may determine the effects in relation to bone mass. The administered E2 doses may also be important.","1346":"The efficacy of growth promoting hormonal therapy is assessed on the basis of growth rate as well as bone age progression until the patients reach their final height. The aim of our study was to investigate which hormonal therapy influences in most appropriate way height velocity and bone age progression in patients with Turner syndrome (TS) and to establish the optimal age to initiate treatment. Patients were divided into five groups according to the type of hormonal therapy: 1) 11 patients treated with growth hormone (GH); 2) 18 patients treated with GH and oxandrolone (Ox); 3) 7 patients treated with GH, Ox and estrogens (E); 4) 6 patients treated with OX and E; and the control group (Group 0) of 62 untreated patients. The patients height was expressed in hSDS calculated on the basis of growth chart for patients with TS (hSDST). Bone age (BA) was assessed according to Greulich-Pyle method. The mean values of deltahSDST in the first and second year of therapy in individual groups were significantly different. The difference resulted from significantly higher value of deltahSDST in group treated with GH+Ox. Analysis of regression between deltaCA and deltaBA revealed regression coefficients alpha of equation deltaBA= alpha x deltaCA: in group 0: 0.817; group GH: 1.233; group GH+Ox: 0.861; group GH+Ox+E: 0.997; group Ox+E: 1.141. There was significant difference between regression coefficients in studied groups. It resulted from significantly higher value of alpha in group treated with GH than in a group 0 and treated with GH+Ox. Only group treated with GH+Ox showed a significant negative correlation between baseline CA and deltaBA during the therapy. We can conclude that all regimens of hormonal therapy improved height in our patients but the highest increase of height during the therapy and the smallest progression of the bone age in the same time were observed in patients treated with GH+Ox.

However, recent advances in cytological diagnostic methods enable patients to choose alternative therapies if there are some contraindications or there is no agreement for surgery. Over past 14 years percutaneous ethanol injections (PEI), used in the past as a therapy for liver, kidney, parathyroid and adrenal cortical tumors, have been developed as an alternative method in the management of thyroid nodules. This paper reviews the investigations of a number aspects of PEI in the treatment of thyroid nodules reported in the literature. The evidence demonstrate that PEI is effective in the case of both solid non-toxic and autonomously functioning toxic nodules as well as cystic nodules. In majority of cases restore normal serum fT4, fT3 and TSH concentrations and shrink the tumor volume. The method seems to be safe and generally well tolerated by the patients. However, the current research base on the efficacy and PEI-associated risks is still inadequate to determine definitively its role as a standard treatment of benign nodular thyroid disease. For example, there is no detailed data comparing the results of treatment with PEI to standard treatment with radioactive iodine and L-thyroxine. Despite it, we conclude that PEI is a valuable method that earned recognition among other methods of the thyroid nodules treatment.","1350":"The authors presented advances in the research on isoform of neural cell adhesion molecule CD56\/NCAM, which appears to raise interest not only in biology, but also in clinical medicine. Molecular aspects of its synthesis have been presented and universal features of this protein have been underlined. It appears to play an important role in body homeostasis and especially in the interactions between neural, immune and endocrine systems. In relation to the immune system there are data suggesting significance of local protective and regulatory mechanisms in the liver linked to so called NKT (CD56+) cells. Main sites of prevalence of CD56\/NCAM have been indicated both in physiology and pathology, especially in malignancy. CD56\/NCAM incidence is common in tumors of neuroectodermal and endocrine origin. Besides it may be expressed on cells of several hemopoetic neoplasms originated both, from lymphoid and myeloid lineage. Moreover, the attention was paid to CD56\/ NCAM expression in atypical sites as for example on epithelia of bile ducts in children with extrahepatic biliary atresia and on cells of pancreatic ducts in the course of chronic pancreatitis.","1351":"The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), lutropin receptor, and follitropin receptor are related members of the superfamily of leucine-rich repeats containing adenylate cyclase stimulating receptors. The unique posttranslational modification of the TSHR leads to the transformation of its monomeric form to the subunit structure where the subunits A and B are connected by disulphide bonds. This natural processing occurs with the release from the receptor of a short peptide C, and is followed by the release of the subunit A. Both monomeric and dimeric forms of the receptor are stimulated by TSH, so no clear functional significance of TSHR modifications have been found. We can speculated that the processing of TSHR with the release of its large fragments contributes to the development of autoimmune diseases and production anti-TSH receptor autoantibodies. The extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves disease may also be related to metastasis of the autoimmune reaction to extrathyroidal sites via the released A subunit. The TSHR processing may, to some extent, be connected to the hyperthyroidism since the release of the subunit A from the receptor augmented the adenylate cyclase activity in the absence of TSH. According to the recent model of receptors action the TSHR is in equilibrium between the inactive (closed) and active (opened) conformations. In opened conformation it can associate with Gs protein and trigger the intracellular signal. TSH and stimulating autoantibodies preferentially bind to opened receptors and stabilizes them.","1352":"Iodine prophylaxis in Poland started in 1997 and is based on mandatory iodzation of household salt with 20-40 mg KI\/ 1 kg, supplementation of bottle fed infants with iodized formulas with 10,0 microg KI\/100 ml, and a voluntary supplementation of pregnant and breast feeding women with additional 100-150 microg of iodine\/ day. Last evaluation of efficacy of the iodine prophylaxis performed in 2003 by WHO and International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders allocated Poland within the group of the European countries with sufficient iodine supplementation on the population level. However according to data of the Institute of Mather and Chield in Poland, around 50 % of pregnant women only is additionally supplemented with iodine. Iodine deficiency during pregnancy even as a moderate iodine deficiency, creates a risk of mental retardation, perinatal complication like low and very low births weigt of neonates with increased perinatal mortality rate and late consequences in adult life: metabolic syndrom and type 2 diabetes. Another limitation of the actual model of iodine prophylaxis in Poland, it is too high consumption of natrum chloride (over 5,0 g of household salt\/day\/ capita). It is around 50% over WHO recommendation. Intensive preventive program against hypertension, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis and some neoplasmatic diseases includes limitation of natrum chloride consumption- as one of the risk factors. Therefore new scope of the National Programme for Elimination of Iodine Deficiency will include: a special prorgramme for the iodization of animal food according to european standard, increased rate of pregnant women additionally supplemented with iodine, strengthening public awarness on necessary increase of milk consumption especially in pregnancy and in children and continouse monitoring system of biologic effects and technologic quality of the model of iodine prophylaxis.","1353":"Restricted number of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) shows overexpression of somatostatin receptors. Therefore, long-acting somatostatin analogues are used in diagnosis and treatment of those tumors. Here we present our first case of NET, localized in pancreas treated with DOTA-D-Phe 1-Tyr 3-octreotide (DOTATATE), for receptor-mediated radioisotope therapy. DOTATATE is a newly developed somatostatin analogue labeled with beta-emitter yttrium 90 (90Y) and beta, gamma-emitter lutetium 177 (177Lu). A 34-year old woman was suffering from several years gastrointestinal symptoms. NET of the pancreas with multiple metastases into the liver was diagnosed based on histopatological, biochemical and radiological tests. First, she had chemiotherapy (leucovorin, 5-FU, cisplatin), however there was any positive effects of this therapy. Next, she received four single doses of 90Y DOTATATE at 4-6- week intervals, yielding a cumulative dose of 7.4 GBq\/m2. During the 4th cycle the Lu-177 DOTATATE was additionally administered. As a renal protection i.v. infusion of amino acid solution were used during the treatment sessions. To date, patient has shown partial remission with reduction of tumor masses. We observed spectacular clinical, biochemical and radiological improvement. Radioisotope therapy could be a powerful and promising method of treatment at least in patients who had no other treatment option.","1354":"The growth and persistence of solid tumors and their metastases is connected with angiogenesis. This process is determined by activity of pro- and antyangiogenic factors. VEGF is the one of the most important factors having a stimulant effect on angiogenesis. Soluble forms of VEGF receptors are inhibitors of angiogenesis. The soluble forms of VEGF receptors containing extra cellular part of receptor, which binds ligand, seem to be real inhibitors of VEGF. Evaluation the value of serum VEGF and soluble forms of VEGF receptors concentration as a marker of malignancy in patients with hormonal inactive adrenal tumors. Twenty seven patients (18 female, 9 male; mean age 48+\/-4.3 years) with adrenocortical carcinoma (N=8), adrenal metastases (N=4) and adrenocortical adenoma (N=15) were included in this study. Age- and gender-matched control samples were acquired from healthy volunteers (N=10). Serum VEGF and sVEGFR levels were determinated by means of ELISA assay. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student-t test, the Pearson's test and the series test. In healthy controls mean VEGF level was 197.2 pg\/ml, sVEGFR-1 43.5 pg\/ml and sVEGFR-2 8976.3 pg\/ml. Patients with adrenocortical carcinoma had the levels of VEGF (1263.8 pg\/ml) significantly higher and of sVEGFR-2 (5893.7 pg\/ml) significantly lower in comparison to control group (p&lt;0.05). On the other hand the mean VEGF (334.2 pg\/ml) concentration in patients with benign adrenocortical adenoma wasn't significant different than in control group (p&gt;0.05) but mean sVEGFR-1 (21.7 pg\/ml) and sVEGFR-2 (7106.4 pg\/ml) concentrations were significantly lower than in the control (p&lt;0.05). In metastases group mean VEGF (485.9 pg\/ml) level was higher and sVEGFR-2 (5455.2 pg\/ml) was lower than in control group (p&lt;0.05). These data suggest that determination of VEGF and sVEGFR concentration in the serum of patients with hormonal inactive adrenal tumors may be applied as an additional marker of malignancy.

Therefore the Gaussian Reference Ranges (GRR) of archival sets of data from 6 laboratories (together 18793 fT4 and 44851 TSH results) were calculated separately with JEG method. The upper and lover ranges were compared with data from 11 bibliographical sources. It was found that in the investigated population the both averaged ranges (high and low) of GRR of fT4 are statistical significant lover then the reference data. In the same time the averaged upper range of GRR of TSH was higher than the averaged data from the literature. Based on statistic analysis of these results it could be estimated that about 20% of the investigated population show evident and about 50% show moderate signs of hypothyreosis.","1356":"Tyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies have been estimated in patients with thyroid autoimmune diseases. In a group of 109 patients with Hashimoto's thyroidities 85.53% and 78.89% were positive for Tyroglobulin antibodies and anti-TPO antibodies respectively. The anti-Tg antibodies has not been detected in 14.67% and anti-TPO in 21.1% patients. Both antibodies have not been detected in 1.83% of patients. In a group of 79 patients with Graves' disease 62.02 and 91.13% were positive for anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies respectively. The anti-Tg antibodies has not been detected in 37.97% and anti-TPO in 8.66% patients. Both antibodies have not been detected in one patients with exophtalmos (1.26%). Our results indicate that anti-tyroglobulin antibodies should be estimated only in patients suspected for thyroid autoimmune disease and negative for thyroid peroxidase antibodies.","1357":"NIS gene is located on chromosome 19 and encodes 643 amino acid protein. It belongs to membrane Na+ dependent glucose symporter proteins family. In normal thyroid is located in basolateral membrane of thyreocyte. It plays a main role in concentrating of iodine in thyreocyte and thus in thyroid hormones synthesis. It was proved that NIS expression influences effectiveness of radioactive iodine therapy in well-differentiated thyroid cancers. The aim of this study was to estimate the NIS expression and its dependence with gender, age and stage in thyroid papillary and follicular cancers. The frozen sections of tissue were used as a source of tumor RNA. RT-PCR technique was employed for NIS expression analysis. We did not find dependence between the presence of NIS expression in investigated thyroid cancers and stage of disease estimated according to TNM classification. We also did not find dependence between NIS expression and gender or sex of the patients. Our results suggest that there is no dependence between NIS expression and iodine uptake.","1358":"The lipodystrophy syndrome with dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance is side-effect of combined antiretroviral therapy (CART). to describe the influence of CART on leptin and adiponectin concentration in connection with lipids levels in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. BMI, serum leptin, adiponectin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations were measured in 56 HIV(+) patients before and on CART; average of treatment duration 38.4 +\/-13.2 months. Significant increase of BMI (p=0.0268) of (22.6 +\/- 3.3 before and 23.5 +\/- 3.4 kg\/m2 on therapy, respectively) and all analyzed lipids were found. Mean adiponectin concentration in treated patients was significantly (7.256 +\/- 3.551 microg\/ml) lower than mean value before treatment (8.395 +\/- 3.568 microg\/ml; p=0.0011). Mean values of leptin concentrations did not differ significantly (before therapy 3.721 +\/- 0.347 log10; on therapy 3.1737 +\/- 0.353 log10). Significant positive correlation between BMI and leptin concentrations was found before, as well as during CART (r=0.5333; p&lt;0.0001), but negative correlation between adiponectin and leptin concentrations (r=-0.2677; p=0.042). Leptin and adiponectin concentrations did not revealed significant correlation with lipids levels before therapy. The decrease of adiponectin concentration on CART correlated negatively with total (r=-0.2912; p=0.0310) and LDL-cholesterol (r=-0.310; p=0.0225). CART lasting longer than 2 years resulted in the decrease of adiponectin concentration, with lack of influence on leptin concentration in analyzed group. The increase of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in correlation with the decrease of adiponectin concentration confirms that CART induces metabolic disturbances related to higher risk of atherosclerosis and its sequel. ","1359":"Clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (CNFPAs) represent about 30% of pituitary macroadenomas, gonadotropinomas being the most frequent among them. The aim of the present study is to re-evaluate the usefulness of the measurement of alpha-SU serum level in response to TRH stimulation in detecting the gonadotropic nature of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas before the neurosurgical treatment. We have studied 14 patients with CNFPAs. The response of alpha-SU to the administration of TRH was studied in each patient before the surgery. alpha-SU blood serum level increase over 50% of the baseline level after TRH treatment was considered to be significant. The patients were divided into 2 groups, each including 7 subjects. The first group included the patients with gonadotropinomas (tumors immunopositive for FSH and\/or LH or their free subunits). The second group included the patients with adenomas immunonegative for gonadotropins and alpha-SU. The basal level of alpha-SU was elevated over the upper limit of normal range in two patients of the first group (gonadotroph adenomas) and in one in the second group. All but one patient from the first group and none of seven patients with tumors immunonegative for FSH, LH or alpha-SU, had a significant alpha-SU (over 50%) response to TRH. In three of seven patients with gonadotropins immunonegative tumors a decrease of alpha-SU serum level after TRH was observed. The measurement of alpha-SU serum level in response to TRH administration seems to be useful in preoperative identification of gonadotroph adenomas among other nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. ","1360":"The increasing interest in somatostatin receptors (SSTR) is mainly due to their involvement in the regulation of hormone secretion and the role in somatostatin analogue treatment of patients with pituitary adenomas. The efficiency of this treatment is highly dependent on receptor expression in tissue which on the protein level requires specific anti-receptor antibodies for testing. In this paper we introduced the principles for the production of several polyclonal antibodies specific for C-terminal intracellular part or N-terminal extracellular part of SSTR2A and SSTR5 receptors. The antibodies were highly specific for peptides used for immunization of animals, had low cross-reaction activities for other SSTR2A and SSTR5 peptides and reacted with receptors on immunoblots and in immunohistochemistry. The final verification of the antibodies' specificity would allow us to perform the research concerning the structure and posttranslational modifications of SSTR and avoid dependency of commercial sources.","1361":"","1362":"","1363":"","1364":"","1365":"","1366":"","1367":"Sporadic generalized form of insensitivity to thyroid hormones of peripheral tissue receptor was proposed as diagnosis in a clinically euthyroid boy 15.5 years old with goiter, having elevated levels of blood serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) associated with absence of TSH suppression. Other possible causes of biochemical hyperthyreosis were excluded by differential diagnosis. The results of functional examination of cardiovascular system by the method of Hauffa could be interpreted only as a lack of response of tissue receptors to the administration of triiodothyronine, also when used in pharmacological doses. Lower response of pituitary to the administered triiodothyronine was demonstrated by applying the TRH stimulation test. No antithyroid treatment was applied in accordance with the data from the literature. In long-term observation (above 1.5 year) clinical state of the boy was still good a gradual increase in growth rate and progress in sexual maturation being noted.","1368":"Urinary excretion of calcium, magnesium, phosphate and oxalate in the condition of low-calcium diet, and the secretion of LH, FSH, testosterone and estradiol following LH-RH stimulation test have been determined in 26 men with active nephrolithiasis and in 14 healthy male subjects. Significantly higher urinary excretion of calcium and oxalate, and significantly lower excretion of magnesium was observed in men with nephrolithiasis as compared to healthy men. In addition, the patients with nephrolithiasis had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone, estradiol and FSH than the healthy controls. The results obtained suggest the participation of the gonadal hormones in the pathogenesis of active nephrolithiasis.","1369":"Binding of 3H-norepinephrine to receptors and insulin release from pancreatic islets isolated from newborns and adult rats were investigated. In the presence of norepinephrine at the concentration of 2.4 x 10(-8) mol\/l adults islets bound 0.37 +\/- 0.11 fmol of norepinephrine per micrograms of islet protein while neonatal islets bound 0.25 +\/- 0.08 fmol\/micrograms. When norepinephrine concentration was raised to 10(-5) mol\/l the amount of bound norepinephrine increased up to 22.66 +\/- 8.7 fmol\/micrograms and 14.20 +\/- 5.36 fmol\/micrograms for both examined groups, respectively. Addition of 5 x 10(-4) mol\/l of phentolamine to the incubation medium induced 74% and 70% decrease of bound norepinephrine to adult and neonatal islets, respectively. At similar range of concentrations both norepinephrine and phentolamine modified the rate of insulin secretion and caused changes in binding of 3H-norepinephrine. There were no differences between the binding of norepinephrine to neonatal and adult islets. This may suggest that adrenergic system may play greater role in the regulation of insulin release from neonatal than from adult islets.","1370":"The concentrations of beta-endorphin, ACTH, insulin (IRI), glucagon (IRG), cortisol and growth hormone were determined by radioimmunoassay during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed in 13 obese patients with normal glucose tolerance and without arterial hypertension. The test was performed in random, before and after intravenous administration of 0.8 mg of naloxone. Six persons with normal body weight served as controls. Higher basal concentrations of beta-endorphin and significant increase in beta-endorphin levels during OGTT, without concomitant increase in ACTH concentrations, have been found in obese patients. No effect of naloxone on beta-endorphin liberation during OGTT was observed, though the drug caused lowering in maximal increment of beta-endorphin and paradoxically lowered the concentrations of ACTH and cortisol. The basal concentrations of beta-endorphin did not correlate with the concentrations of insulin, ACTH, cortisol and growth hormone. Elevated concentrations of insulin, lowered concentration of growth hormone and normal levels of glucose and glucagon were observed in basal conditions, and excessive responses of insulin, glucose and glucagon were observed in obese patients during OGTT. Naloxone lowered insulin response and inhibited the fall of growth hormone during OGTT but did not influence the concentrations of glucose and glucagon. No correlation was found during OGTT after naloxone between insulin and beta-endorphin, ACTH or cortisol, whereas negative correlation was observed between insulin and growth hormone. The obtained results suggest that the elevated concentrations of beta-endorphin in simple obesity may be of both hypophyseal and peripheral origin. Hyper-beta-endorphinemia observed in obesity is probably not directly responsible for hyperinsulinemia, it may, however, be responsible for lower sensitivity of tissues to the action of insulin.","1371":"Blood serum fructosamine and blood glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) concentrations were determined in 47 children with newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes during their first stay in the hospital. Three determinations at week's intervals were carried out in each patient. The mean values of concentration decrement after the first, second and third week of treatment were 0.47, 0.37 and 0.26 mmol\/l, respectively, (median values 0.56, 0.33 and 0.17 mmol\/l) for fructosamine concentration, and 1.8, 2.9 and 1.0% (median 1.5, 2.3 and 0.8%) for HbA1. No correlation was found between the weekly decrement values in fructosamine and HbA1 concentrations when all the values were taken into consideration, and only a slight positive correlation when the decrement after two weeks of treatment was considered (r = 0.57, p &lt; 0.05). Very high rate of decrease in the concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin was noted in some children, reaching the values from 4 to even 8.6% per week.","1372":"The study was aimed at investigating the effect of monosodium glutamate administered during the perinatal period on the reproductive system of sexually mature male rats. Monosodium glutamate (at a dose of 4 mg\/g of body weight) or hypertonic saline was administered subcutaneously to newborn rats at 2--nd, 4-th, 6-th, 8-th and 10-th day of life. At the age of four months the rats were killed and histological and morphometric examinations of testes, epididymis, seminal vesicles and ventral prostate were carried out. Blood serum levels of LH, FSH, testosterone and 17-beta-estradiol were determined by radioimmunoassay. The administration of monosodium glutamate caused inhibition of growth, obesity and decrease in weight of pituitary glands and testes. Blood serum levels of and FSH as well as the height of epithelial cells of accessory sexual glands remained unchanged, whereas testosterone level was lowered.","1373":"Among 67 women with pure gonadal dysgenesis, karyotype 46XY was found in 46 and karyotype 46XX in 21 (26.3% of all intersexual subjects). Karyotype 46XY was either of pure type or mosaicism 45,X\/46,XY (10.9%). Primary amenorrhea, underdevelopment of mammary glands and lack or poor development of pubic hair were the main complaints of the patients. In gonadal dysgenesis 46XY mammary glands were developed in 21.8% and pubic hair in 26% suggesting the presence within the gonads of the hormonally active tumor or the state after hormonal treatment. The patients with gonadal dysgenesis 46XX had lowered levels of estrogens and elevated levels of FSH and LH. Karyotype 46XY was not associated with evident changes in hormonal levels. Estrogens were both low and normal, and FSH was elevated (21.5 + 16.6 ug\/ml) or normal (3.2-5.0 ng\/ml). Total testosterone values were normal or slightly elevated. Such situation can be explained by the presence in some patients of tumors secreting either estrogens or androgens. Taeniform character of gonads was observed by ultrasonography whenever the presence of gonadal tumor was excluded. Histology of specimens taken from gonads or tumors demonstrated the presence of dysgerminoma or gonadoblastoma type of malignancy in 53.1%, foci or proliferation of the Leydig cells in 31.3% and typical morphology of residual gonads without germinal cells only in 12.5%. The differentiation between pure gonadal dysgenesis 46XX and primary ovarian insufficiency is required whenever no characteristic pattern emerges from clinical, hormonal, cytogenetic or ultrasonographic examination. Diagnosis of pure gonadal dysgenesis 46XX can be finally confirmed by the absence of gonocytes in the residual gonad. Besides of removal of gonads or tumors by surgery, the treatment of patients with 46XY karyotype consists in cyclic administration of estrogens and progestagens restoring menstruation and bringing development of secondary sex attributes.","1374":"Antiestrogen stimulation test consisting in the administration of Clostilbegyt (50 mg dose twice daily during ten days) was performed in 21 normospermic fertile men, and in 36 patients with idiopathic oligozoospermia after chronic therapy with Clostilbegyt (50 mg daily for 240 days). Among the latter, in 24 the therapy did not bring improvement in the number of spermatozoa, and in 12 patients chronic treatment with Clostilbegyt resulted in about fivefold increase in the number of spermatocytes in 1 ml of semen. It was found that the increase in blood serum estradiol in response to stimulation was much higher (118.9%) in patients not reacting to chronic Clostilbegyt therapy than in normospermic subject (60.8%) or oligospermic patients who reacted positively to the therapy (58.8%). This observation suggests the mechanism of negative results of antiestrogenic therapy in the majority of oligozoospermic patients.","1375":"A double blind, double dummy study on the efficacy, tolerability and safety of Parlodel LAR versus oral Parlodel was carried out in 13 hyperprolactinemic women. Six patients received active from of Parlodel LAR (1 intramuscular injection at a dose of 50 mg) and placebo for oral Parlodel simultaneously. Seven other patients received active form of Parlodel orally (up to 7.5 mg daily) and placebo for Parlodel LAR injection. In all patients the marked reduction in serum prolactin level was observed. In normalization of prolactinemia was achieved in 8 patients (2 LAR, 6 oral). Galactorrhea disappeared in 7 of 8 patients (4 LAR, 3 oral), menstrual bleeding occurred in 5 of 10 amenorrheic patients (3 LAR, 2 oral). Tumor shrinkage was shown in 1 case (oral therapy). The improvement of slightly narrowed visual field was documented in 3 cases (2 LAR, 1 oral). The adverse effect during the therapy were mild and transient. We conclude that both froms of bromocriptine are very useful for treatment of hyperprolactinemia but Parlodel LAR is better tolerated and more convenient in application because of its prolonged activity.","1376":"Usefulness of determination of blood serum prolactin concentration and the result of thyroliberin (TRH) stimulation test for predicting the magnitude of growth hormone (GH) response to the administration of sandostatin and bromocriptine has been evaluated in 14 patients with active acromegaly. No relation was found between the occurrence of hyperprolactinemia and the response of GH to the administration of sandostatin and bromocriptine. Analysis of GH secretion after TRH administration made possible the selection of a group of acromegalic patients with paradoxical increase in GH secretion in response to TRH in whom the administration of sandostatin caused a significant decrease in blood serum concentration of GH following the administration of sandostatin. TRH stimulation test had, however, no value in predicting the effect of bromocriptine on GH secretion.","1377":"Ultrasonographic examination of the thyroid was carried out in 150 patients of mean age 37 +\/- 11 years, including 100 patients with nontoxic parenchymal goiter and 50 patients with toxic parenchymal goiter associated with the Graves' disease. Ultrasonograph Siemens Sonoline LM with 7.5 MHz head was used in the study. The study was aimed at the evaluation of functional and morphological state of the thyroid in patients with nontoxic and toxic parenchymal goiter. In the case of nontoxic goiter, heterogeneous (100%) and normoechogenic (100%) structure of the parenchyma was visualized by ultrasonography. In toxic parenchymal goiter (Graves' disease), on the other hand, hypoechogenic (92%) and marginally pseudo-cystoid structure of parenchyma was observed. In this group of patients, high values of thyroid hormones (100%) were associated with high level of thyroid antibodies (92%). It can be concluded that ultrasonography is an useful tool for evaluation of functional and morphological state of the thyroid in patients with nontoxic and toxic parenchymal goiter.","1378":"Ultrasonographic examination was carried out in 90 patients in whom single thyroid nodule was found by palpation and scintigraphic examination. In 67 of these patients (61%) the presence of a single nodule was confirmed by ultrasonography. In the remaining 23 (38%) multiple nodules were found within the gland. Ultrasonographic examination made possible the differentiation of solid lesions from the cystoid ones in 100%. Follicular adenomas appeared in ultrasonography as mixed-type nodules with the features of degeneration characterized by the presence of the areola (the so called \"halo\"). The Hurtle's adenomas appeared as mixed-type nodules, hypo-echogenic and devoid of areola. The observed neoplastic lesion (carcinoma follicular) was of a cystoid type. The appearance of cystoid lesions made possible the differentiation of simple cysts from those originating from tumor decomposition. Ultrasonography may then be helpful not only for distinguishing between cystoid-type and solid type lesions but also for classifying solid nodular structures as malignant or benign.","1379":"The study was aimed at evaluation of applicability of 99mTc-labeled MIBI accumulation for early diagnosis of thyroid cancer. The investigated group included 16 patients with cold nodules of the thyroid in whom the presence of thyroid cancer or thyroid adenoma was diagnosed by means of a thin-needle biopsy. All the patients studied were subjected to surgical treatment. Prior to the operation, each patient was subjected to scintigraphic examination of the thyroid 10 minutes after intravenous administration of 185 MBq (5 mCi) 99mTc-MIBI. Scintigraphy was performed by using a ZLC Digitrac gamma camera of Siemens equipped with a Micro Delta computer. The accumulation of the tracer within the cold nodules was demonstrated in 11 patients with thyroid cancer (7 with follicular cancer, 2 with papillary cancer, 1 with anaplastic cancer and 1 with metastases to the thyroid) and in 2 patients with thyroid adenoma. This represents diagnostic accuracy of 0.85 in cases of thyroid cancer and 0.65 in cases of thyroid adenoma. Two conclusions can be formulated on the basis of the results obtained: first conclusion is that both thyroid cancer and thyroid adenoma do exhibit the ability to accumulate 99mTc-MIBI; the second conclusion is that 99mTc-labeled MIBI as used for scintigraphy of cold nodules of the thyroid is an useful marker of thyroid cancer in its early phase.","1380":"Many mechanism may participate in the inhibition of thyroid function by excess of iodine. The present study was aimed at answering the question, whether the excess of iodine influences the activity of type I thyroxine 5'-deiodinase. To 40 female rats fed with standard diet a dose of 42 micrograms of iodine daily was administered into the stomach through the gastric tube. Control group consisting of 10 rats received standard diet only. Part of the animals was sacrificed after each of the consecutive time intervals (2, 4, 7 and 14 days of treatment with iodine) and the activity of deiodinase in the thyroid as well as the blood serum levels of hormones, T3 and T4, were determined. A decrease in the activity of deiodinase in comparison with control group was observed during the whole experiment, the highest inhibition occurring after 4 days of treatment with iodine. A fall in the concentration of T3 was observed after the second and fourth dose of iodine, with no change in T4 concentration. The results of the experiments indicate that the excess of iodine inhibits the activity of type I thyroxine 5'-deiodinase in the thyroid.","1381":"","1382":"","1383":"A nation-wide epidemiological survey was conducted on a random sample of 19,300 schoolchildren, 0.5% of the 6-13-years-old child population. The study included data on body mass, height, thyroid size according to the ICCIDD\/WHO classification, and information on iodized salt intake. Thyroid volume was measured with a portable USG also, and iodine concentrations in casual urine specimens were measured. In 80% of the children, urine iodine concentrations were below 100 mu\/l; about 5% of the children had enlarged thyroid glands in class II or III of the ICCIDD\/WHO classification, and hypothyroidism was not observed during examination. These findings mean that Poland is an area of mild or moderate endemic goiter. The highest prevalence of goiter as determined by USG was observed in the Sudeten, Carpathian, and northeastern parts of Poland. In these areas, 40-80% of the children had urine iodine concentrations within 0-50 micrograms\/l; this region was classified as a moderate endemia area. The lowest prevalence was in the northwestern part of the country; 60-90% of the children had iodine concentrations above 50 micrograms\/l, and 23-35% above 100 micrograms\/l. This area was classified as a mild endemic goiter area. Comparison of the thyroid size measures yields a very low (20%) coefficient of accuracy for class Ia. This class seems of questionable value for an epidemiological survey. Multifactorial analysis of variance of iodine concentrations shows the effects of some main factors: geographical area, iodine prophylaxis and urban\/rural residence. The questionnaire results indicate that only about 20% of the total population uses iodized salt. The effectiveness of prophylaxis was very low; increases in urine iodine concentrations and decreases of goiter prevalence in the children using iodized salt did not exceed 10%. This points to the need to increase the KJ dose in table salt and to develop a new model for distribution of iodized salt in Poland.","1384":null,"1385":"Simple and specific methods for iodide determination in potable water and total iodine in selected food products by means of energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) has been worked out.

Urine was also sampled to measure iodine concentration with cerium-arsenic method. In 39.1% of the examined children goiter was found by physical examination and was more frequent in the rural group (41%) than in the urban children (36%). Mean iodine concentration in the urine was significantly higher in the group with goiter (52.7 micrograms\/l) than in the group without goiter (42.3 micrograms\/l) No symptoms of hypothyroidism were observed in the studied group. Moreover the presence of goiter had no influence on physical development of the children. According to the questionnaires, iodized salt is used by 26% of children in the cities and 16% in the villages. Neither iodine level in the urine nor prevalence of goiter was markedly affected by iodine prophylaxis. We conclude that the north-eastern region of Poland in an area of a moderate iodine deficiency and that the present model of iodine prophylaxis is insufficient.","1393":null,"1394":null,"1395":"As a part of the programme concerning iodine deficiency and iodine prophylaxis in Poland, 2518 children of age between 6 and 13 years, living in Lower and Middle Silesia, were studied. The anamnesis was based on a questionnaire answered by parents of the investigated children. The physical examination included measurements of body height and mass, clinical symptoms of thyroid functions as well as size and compactness of the thyroid gland on the basis of WHO classification. Urinary concentration of iodine was measured. The majority of children with goiter were inhabitants of mountainous villages. The goiter was most frequent in the age group 9-10 years. No significant differences in goiter incidence could be found between children consuming and not consuming iodized kitchen salt. The urinary concentration of iodine was low in all children examined. It was concluded that the territory of Lower and Middle Silesia is still a region of moderate endemic goiter. The urinary iodine concentrations is low in children living in Lower and Middle Silesia. The present system of iodine prophylaxis is not adequate and new measures should be urgently introduced.","1396":"The study included 4103 school children attending randomly selected schools localized in towns and villages of 3 geographically distinct regions: mountainous, (Carpathian endemia), upland, lowland. The children were divided into four age-related groups. The incidence of goiter as detected by palpation was 38.1% in all the children studied, the value being similar in all three regions (38.1, 37.3 and 38.6%, respectively). Goiter incidence differs slightly among urban and rural children, amounting to 40.5 and 34.5%, respectively, in the two groups. In about 60% of children urinary iodine excretion was lower than 50 micrograms\/l, while in about 30% it was normal. In about 10% of children studied urinary iodine excretion was lower than 20 micrograms\/l. The results obtained indicate the occurrence among children of the studied region of goiter endemy of moderate degree. It was found that the percentage of children excreting more than 50 micrograms\/l of urinary iodine was higher among those consuming iodized salt as compared to those consuming non-iodized salt. The first effects of resumption of common salt fortification with iodide in southern Poland can already be noted. There is, however, a need for optimization and steady control over this prophylactic action.","1397":null,"1398":"Frozen, lyophilized or acetone-dried pituitary glands were minced and extracted with five different extraction mixtures. The glycoprotein fraction was precipitated from the extract by increasing the concentration of an appropriate solvent. It was found that the highest yield of follitropin was obtained by freezing the pituitary glands with liquid nitrogen followed by extraction with 1 M solution of ammonium chloride in 50% aqueous acetone. The following conditions were found to be optimal for obtaining high yield of extraction ratio 1:20, time of extraction 30 minutes, and the concentration of solvent for glycoprotein precipitation 80-86%.","1399":"The effect of progesterone on lipolysis in blood and in adipose tissue of female rats has been investigated. The hormone was administered to the studied animals subcutaneously during 20 days. The lipid mobilizing activity was determined in blood serum according to the four experimental protocols: test serum--test tissue, test serum--control tissue, control serum--test tissue, and control serum--control tissue. Blood serum concentrations of triglycerides, free fatty acids and glucose, as well as lipolytic activity against exogenous substrate, were determined in addition. Progesterone administration was found to enhance the activity of factors potentiating lipolysis in adipose tissue of female rats after 20 days administration of the hormone. There was an increase in free fatty acids, triglycerides and glucose concentrations. Progesterone was found not to change the activity of factors influencing lipolysis in the blood of female rats during the period of administration of the hormone.","1400":"The study was aimed at evaluation of usefulness of determination of blood serum 21-deoxycortisol concentration for the detection of heterozygous carriers of incomplete block of 21-hydroxylase synthesis leading to adrenal hyperplasia. An earlier observation of the authors that the determination of 21-deoxycortisol is a more sensitive marker than 17-hydroxyprogesterone for diagnosing this genetic defect provided the motivation for undertaking this study. The levels of 21-deoxycortisol and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were determined in blood serum by using radioimmunoassay methods in 18 mothers and 21 fathers of children born with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, before and after intravenous administration of ACTH. As a control group served 15 women and 11 men of the corresponding age. Unlike 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 21-deoxycortisol levels were significantly higher both in women (20.5 +\/- 12.6 ng\/dl) and in men (21.2 +\/- 14.4 ng\/l) suspected of being heterozygous carriers, both before and after stimulation with ACTH, as compared to those in the control group (6.9 +\/- 3.6 in women and 7.9 +\/- 2.8 in men). Only in three women and in two men suspected of carrying the defective gene the values of 21-deoxycortisol were in normal range. The results obtained demonstrated evidently that 21-deoxycortisol can be regarded as a more sensitive marker for the detection of heterozygous carriers of 21-hydroxylase deficiency than 17-hydroxyprogesterone and the determination of 21-deoxycortisol is more useful for diagnosing this genetic defect.","1401":"It was found on the basis of observation of 40 patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome carried out during over 25 years that in patients with female phenotype and male genotype the mean blood plasma level of testosterone was 6.4 +\/- 1.6 ng\/ml, corresponding to that characteristic for healthy males. In classical form of the syndrome there is absent or very scarce pubic hair in 100% of cases, normal development of mammary glands in 97% of cases, blind vagina of mean length 5.0 +\/- 2.3 cm in 97% of cases and unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia in 30.3% of cases. In the incomplete form of androgen insensitivity normal development of mammary glands occurs in 71.4%, pubic hair in 57.1%, complete absence of vagina in 57.1%, blind vagina of mean length 2.5 cm in 42.9%, inguinal hernia in 71.4% and hypertrophy of clitoris of mean length 2.0 +\/- 1.0 cm in 57.1% of cases, what distinguishes this form of the syndrome from classical form. In 85.7% of cases of incomplete form surgery for inguinal hernia is necessary; in 42.9% artificial vagina has to be created. Among the patients with the syndrome, classical form occurs in 82.5% and incomplete form in 17.5% of cases. Distinguishing between the two forms is fully justified because of clinical and therapeutic reasons. Though malignancy of the gonads appears infrequently among the patients with the insensitivity syndrome, but periodical control of the state of testes, especially at adulthood is necessary. Castration should be avoided before the patient attains full sexual maturity. Normal value of testosterone level, characteristic for men, suggests that lack of sensitivity to androgens of the target cells is the main cause of the disease.","1402":"Significantly higher values of systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure as compared to the corresponding control group was found in a group of 31 patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) of age between 22 and 42 years (mean 34 years). It was demonstrated that the activity of the enzyme converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II (angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE) as determined by the spectrofluorometric method of Friedland and Silverstein did not differ significantly from that found in the control group. No significant correlation was also found between the ACE activity and the concentrations of testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, LH, FSH, prolactin and estradiol both in the patients and in the control group.","1403":"Long-acting bromocriptine (Parlodel LAR) was used for treatment of 25 patients with acromegaly during the period of 3 to 24 months. Even after the first intramuscular injection of 50 milligrams of the drug a decrease in growth hormone (GH) concentration by at least 50% of the initial values was observed in 28% of patients and an improvement in a sense of well-being in 44%. After 6 months of administration of 100 mg of Parlodel LAR at intervals of 28 days a decrease in GH level by at least 50% was observed in a larger percentage of patients (36.8%), and in 10.5% of them there was a fall of GH concentration to below 10 microU\/ml. Side effects, like nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotony, appeared within several hours after the injection of Parlodel and lasted in most cases up to 24 hours. After consecutive injections of the drug the side effects were of lesser intensity or completely disappeared. The results obtained allow to conclude that Parlodel LAR is an effective drug in some cases of acromegaly. In most patients the therapeutic effect can be seen after the first injection, but in some cases it appears only after several months of treatment.","1404":"Chronic renal insufficiency is known to be associated with the disturbed secretion of growth hormone. The present study was aimed at investigating the effect of hemodialysis lasting several years on growth hormone secretion. The studied groups consisted of 12 nondialyzed patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 12 patients dialyzed for 1 to 50 months, 12 patients dialyzed for 51 to 100 months, 12 patients dialyzed for over 100 months and 12 healthy subjects. Blood serum concentrations of glucose and growth hormone were determined immediately before (basal level) and after inducing hypoglycemia by intravenous administration of 0.1 unit\/kg body weight of crystalline insulin. The following results were obtained: 1. In patients with chronic renal insufficiency basal concentration of growth hormone was significantly elevated as compared to that in healthy people irrespective to the duration of hemodialysis. 2. Basal concentration of growth hormone was significantly higher in dialyzed patients than in nondialyzed patients. In patients dialyzed less than 50 months the basal growth hormone concentration was significantly higher than in the remaining groups of dialyzed patients. 3. In the patients dialyzed over 50 months the increment of growth hormone concentration was significantly lower than that in patients dialyzed less than 50 months and in those nondialyzed. It was concluded that hemodialysis continued for many years in patients with chronic renal insufficiency seems to influence significantly the secretion of growth hormone.","1405":"Iso-transplantation of 800 isolated rat pancreatic islets into the portal vein of diabetic rats was performed. Isolated islets were kept in Hanks buffer for 12 hours prior to transplantation. Part of donors was pretreated with allopurinol, alpha-tocopherol and chlorpromazine. Transplantation of islets isolated from nonpretreated rats did not cause any significant changes in plasma glucose concentration of recipients, while transplantation of islets isolated from donors after pretreatment with the tested substances brought glucose level back to normal 3 days after transplantation. Our results indicate that the combination of free radical scavengers, antioxidants and membrane stabilizing drugs may be used to increase the effectiveness of islet transplantation in humans.","1406":"The rate of binding and degradation of 125I insulin by red blood cell receptors was determined in children with insulin-dependent diabetes at rest and after physical exercise of moderate intensity (35% VO2max). Anthropometric values, duration of the disease, parameters of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism as well as blood serum levels of insulin and C-peptide were used as the features characterizing the studied children. The determination of the amount of bound and degraded 125I insulin by intact erythrocytes was carried out by the modified method of Gambhir. The method of Hildebrandt was used when the analogous measurements were carried out with hemolysate as a source of receptor. It was found that physical exercise of aerobic type resulted in an increase in the amount of 125I-insulin bound to the red blood cell receptors by about 30%. This value was not statistically significant. Statistically significant differences were, however, obtained for post-exercise concentrations of insulin and C-peptide in blood serum and for the amounts of 125I-insulin degraded by intact erythrocytes and by hemolysate. The observed increase in the amount of degraded insulin may reflect an increase in the activity of insulinase, an enzyme bound to the cell membrane and partly present in the cytoplasm.","1407":null,"1408":"The study was aimed at determination of the effect of age on the function of thyroid gland in all consecutive phases of human life--from the newborn period to the late senility. Blood serum concentrations of total and free thyroxine, total and free triiodothyronine, reverse--triiodothyronine and TSH were determined by radioimmunoassay in 1350 euthyroid persons of age ranging from 3 days to 81 years. It was found that both secretory function of the thyroid and the peripheral metabolism of the hormones secreted undergo the changes parallel to the advancement of age and to the development of the organism. The relation between the age and thyroid function is most clearly evident in the early period of life, i.e. between the newborn period and the time of attaining the maturity. In adults the relation is clearly less pronounced to gain in intensity again in elderly people.","1409":"","1410":"","1411":"The ultrastructure of pinealocytes was studied in Syrian hamsters maintained under 12:12 light: dark cycle, both during the daytime (1300h) and at night (0100h). At night the pinealocytes showed ultrastructural features indicating an increased metabolic and synthetic activity of these cells. It was expressed by higher relative volumes of mitochondria, lysosomes, lipid droplets, granular endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles containing flocculent material at night in comparison with those during the daytime. By contrast, the number of the dense-core vesicles, both in the cell body and in the endings of pinealocyte processes was higher during the daytime than at night. Quantitative morphological results correlate with the well known nocturnal enhancement in biochemical activity of the pineal gland, especially the circadian rhythm of the secretion of the pineal hormone-melatonin.","1412":"The study was aimed at the determination of the effect of estrogens on paracetamol pharmacokinetics in female rabbits subjected to bilateral ovariectomy. Eighteen female rabbits divided into two groups, control and experimental, subjected to ovariectomy, were used in the study. Pharmacokinetic experiments were carried out in all the animals before the operation, 1 month after, and 2 months after ovariectomy. Samples of blood were taken periodically during 24 hours after intragastric administration of paracetamol at a dose of 50 mg\/kg of body weight. An open two-compartment model was used for the description of concentration changes. A decrease in the area under the curve of changes of paracetamol concentration and in the half-time of the elimination phase, as well as an increase in the total clearance of the drug, have been observed. The results of the study indicate that the rate of elimination of paracetamol is higher in ovariectomized animals.","1413":"The aim of the study was to answer the question whether a rapid decrease in serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels resulting from the treatment with a full dose (3 x 20 mg daily) of methimazole applied in patients with thyrotoxicosis is associated with the parallel diminution of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and its second messenger-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations. Sixteen patients with thyrotoxicosis of mean age 41.5 +\/- 10.5 years participated in the study. Short-term (10 days) methimazole treatment resulted in a significant decrease in serum T3 and T4 concentrations to the values found in 14 healthy subjects serving as control group. Plasma ANP and cGMP levels also decreased significantly during the treatment attaining the normal range. A significant correlation was found between the decrease in serum T3 and T4 concentrations during the treatment and the decrease in plasma ANP level. The decrease in plasma ANP was not closely correlated with the reduction of cGMP levels. These results indicate that: 1) a steep decrease in serum thyroid hormone concentrations induced by a full methimazole treatment during ten days in patients with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease was accompanied by the return of elevated plasma ANP levels to normal range; 2. diminution of serum concentrations of both T3 and T4 during the treatment was correlated with the decrease in plasma ANP; 3) reduction in plasma cGMP concentration associated with short-term methimazole treatment in thyrotoxicosis seems to depend not only on the diminution of plasma ANP level.","1414":"Significantly lower blood serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) accompanied by a significantly higher concentration of thyrotropin (TSH) have been found in workers exposed to the environmental presence of manganese, iron chromates and other agents as compared to the control group (differing with respect to the environmental exposure to manganese only).","1415":"Anti-adrenal and anti-pituitary autoantibodies have been determined in 45 patients with autoimmune diseases of the thyroid, including 25 patients with Graves' disease and 20 patients with hypothyroidism of autoimmune origin. The determinations were carried out with the use of solid-phase RIA methods previously developed by us, involving polyethylene tubes coated with the solubilized microsomal fractions obtained from human adrenal and pituitary glands. In the majority of patients with autoimmune diseases of the thyroid the presence of both anti-adrenal and anti-pituitary autoantibodies was detected. In 13 among 20 patients with hypothyroidism of autoimmune origin, the presence of anti-adrenal autoantibodies, and in 12 the presence of anti-pituitary autoantibodies was found. Among 25 patients with Graves' disease, 19 had both anti-adrenal and anti-pituitary autoantibodies. In the majority of patients with autoimmune diseases of the thyroid the titers of autoantibodies of both types were high but in no case were the clinical symptoms of adrenal or pituitary hypofunction observed. Our studies indicate that the thyroid diseases of autoimmune origin can be regarded as manifestation of some more generalized autoimmunization process.","1416":"The effect of 1,25-hydroxy vitamin D3 on the secretion of TSH was studied in 49 patients with primary hypothyroidism. The vitamin D3 metabolite did not cause any significant changes in the secretion of TSH both basal and stimulated with TRH in patients with untreated hypothyroidism. In those treated with the synthetic L-thyroxine it produced a significant increase in basal TSH secretion.","1417":"Relation between the appearance of impaired carbohydrate tolerance and such factors as the duration of hyperthyroidism, age of patients, blood serum concentrations of thyroxine, triiodothyronine and free fatty acids, as well as insulin secretion both basal and stimulated by oral and \"intravenous glucose administration was studied in 62 patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. Control group consisted of 24 healthy subjects having performed oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests. Among the studied factors, high blood serum concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine, elevated concentration of free fatty acids and defective insulin secretion influenced the appearance of impaired glucose tolerance in patients with hyperthyroidism. No relation was found, however, between the impaired glucose tolerance and the duration of hyperthyroidism or the age of patients.","1418":"As shown in our previous study, hypothermia provokes a variety of hormonal changes including inhibition of insulin secretion and increase in blood serum glucagon level. According to Therminarias et al. the administration of exogenous insulin to dogs subjected to hypothermia causes a calorigenic effect by enhancing oxygen consumption and rising the intensity of shivering thermogenesis. The study was aimed at establishing whether exogenous insulin administered to rats subjected to brief hypothermia and having the shivering thermogenesis blocked by thiobutabarbital anesthesia can influence rectal temperature, the levels of some hormones and energy metabolism. The results obtained suggest that 1) insulin administration causes an increase in the energy charge potential (ECP) both in the liver and in skeletal muscle of the rat, indicating the domination of anabolic processes both in normothermic and hypothermic conditions, 2) there is a negative correlation between the levels of insulin and free fatty acids and the activity of isocitric dehydrogenase in rat liver mitochondria, and 3) the administration of insulin at a dose provoking metabolic response both in normothermic and hypothermic conditions was ineffective in provoking temperature response, indicating the existence of a functional dissociation between the various effects of the same dose of exogenous insulin.","1419":"The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of free beta cells transplantation on carbohydrate tolerance in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Free beta cells were isolated by mechanical disruption of isolated pancreatic islets in Ca and Mg free medium. 1500 and 3000 isolated islets were used for the isolation of 500 x 10(3)-1.099 x 10(3) and 1.398 x 10(3)-2.098 x 10(3) free cells, respectively. Between 78% and 98% of all isolated cells were the variable cells. After isogenic transplantation of free beta cells, blood glucose concentration in all animals was normalized within 14 days. The rate of glycemia normalization was related to the amount of viable free cells. The glucose assimilation coefficient after intravenous glucose administration in normal rats, diabetic rats and diabetic rats after transplantation of free cells was: 2.98 x 10(-2); 0.68 x 10(-2) and 2.04 x 10(-2) mg\/dl\/min, respectively. Allogenic transplantation of free beta cells caused only a transient decrease in blood glucose level.","1420":"","1421":"","1422":"","1423":"","1424":"NORs are the loops of DNA that contain the sites of ribosomal genes around which the nucleolus is formed during telophase of mitosis. In light microscopy they can be visualized by simple silver staining technique as small dark dots within the nucleus. It has been recognized that in many neoplasms, especially malignant AgNORs are more numerous and often atypical when compared with benign tumors and normal tissue. We have introduced this novel technique to the fine needle cytology of thyroid neoplasms (n = 56). We have analyzed the number, the area of AgNORs, the number of clustered AgNORs in the nucleus and the ratio of AgNOR area to the nuclear area and the area of single AgNOR by means of semiautomatic computerized image analysis. We have studied cytological samples consisting of 7 simple goiters, 7 hyperplasias, 15 follicular adenomas, 7 oxyphilic follicular adenomas, 6 follicular carcinomas, 8 oxyphilic follicular carcinomas, 6 papillary adenocarcinomas. In this study we have demonstrated that some differences in the AgNORs value are associated with the type of tumor rather than with malignancy. Location of the AgNORs seems to be very typical for some types of tumors. For example in oxyphilic neoplasms they form single clusters in the nucleus and in papillary adenocarcinomas they form at least two abundant clusters. In other proliferative lesions of the thyroid gland location of AgNORs is less typical.","1425":"There is evidence to suggest that elevated levels of iodide in the diet are associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) in susceptible individuals, and that autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) is less common in susceptible individuals who live in regions with dietary iodine deficiency. There are epidemiologic studies in endemic goiter areas that report an increase in ATD, particularly thyroiditis, after the therapeutic administration of iodized salt, bread and oil. Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid is rarely found in patients from severe endemic goiter regions, yet there is a reversal of this observation after dietary iodine supplementation. Thyroid antibodies, both thyroglobulin (TgAb) and peroxidase (TpAb) or microsomal, were not detected in serum from patients with endemic goiter, but became positive in 43% of subjects three and six months after therapy with iodized oil, and there developed transient hyperthyroidism. Similarly, the addition of iodine to the diet or the administration of iodine-containing medications increases the frequency of ATD and the severity of existing autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, autoimmune thyroiditis has been induced by the administration of excess iodide to strains of chickens and rats that are genetically predetermined to develop the disease. We are beginning to understand the pathogenesis of ATD. In hyperthyroidism the evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) stimulate the TSH receptor to induce excessive and sustained secretion of thyroid hormones. Cellmediated immune mechanisms, such as antibody dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), initiate the lymphocytic infiltration and thyrocytotoxicity in autoimmune thyroiditis. The mechanisms that initiate the development of the abnormal immune response and the relationship of ATD with excess iodide are poorly understood. There is evidence that an increase in the iodination of thyroglobulin (Tg) enhances its immunogenicity. The results of clinical and experimental studies support the requirement of a genetic predisposition to the development of ATD that may be precipitated by exposure to certain environmental factors. Another mechanism supported by experimental data is the direct toxic effect of excess iodide on iodide-deficient thyroid glands. High concentrations of iodide after oxidation to iodine causes epithelial necrosis and inflammation associated with lipofuscin accumulation suggestive of toxicity mediated by lipid peroxidation from excessive amounts of free radicals. The epithelial damage would initiate inflammatory and immune responses. Although these mechanisms would relate to the onset of autoimmune thyroiditis on exposure to excessive amounts of iodide, the relationship of iodide intake and autoimmune hyperthyroidism is less clear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1426":null,"1427":"Kinetical catalytic method of iodide determination in urine was described.

High sensitivity range of iodide concentration and simplicity of performance predestinate described method for epidemiological studies in iodide deficiency regions.","1428":"High incidence of goitre in human together with low level of iodine in water and cow milk have been observed in Southern Poland (Table I). Therefore, iodine deficiency was considered as the only cause of goiter development. The correlation coefficient between iodine concentration in water and cow milk was r = 0.76 (Fig. 1) and indicate the possibility of iodine determination in milk instead of water. The iodine determination in milk reflects the level of iodine in water as well as in food, a negative correlation has been obtained between goitre incidence in human and iodine concentration in water (r = 0.43) (Fig. 2.). A low correlation coefficient suggest that iodine is not a solely factor responsible for goitre development. Studies on cows have indicated that thiocyanate may have effect on goitre development as well. There has been found higher concentration of thiocyanate (SCN) in blood plasma and in enlarged thyroids (Table II). Thiocyanate belongs to goitrogenic compounds and its main source are the plants of Brassica species widely cultivated in southern Poland. It has been found that cows fed with Brassica plants have high level of SCN both in blood and milk with no alteration of plasma iodine level. The transfer of iodine from plasma to milk is only slightly affected (Table III). The level of SCN in the thyroid depends on its plasma concentration; the calculated correlation coefficient is r = 0.88 (Fig. 3). Enhanced thyrotropin (TSH) secretion (during goitrogenesis) may be accompanied by increased accumulation of SCN in the thyroid (like iodide) and reduced oxidation to SO4 (unlike iodide) (Fig. 4). Therefore we postulated that TSH may be partly responsible for increased SCN level in goitrous thyroids. The question arise whether increased ingestion of SCN does really potentiate iodine deficiency and goitrogenic process in animals breeding in southern Poland. For explanation some additionally experiments were performed on laboratory animals. It have been observed that enhanced level of plasma SCN following feeding with Brassica plants increased proportionally the goitrogenic action as well as the accumulation of 131J by the thyroid and its conversion into organic form (Fig. 5). The latter data was confirmed by positive correlation between thyroxine and plasma SCN levels in sheep (r = 0.49), (Fig. 6) Thiocyanate like other monovalent anions suppress goitrogenic effect of propylthiouracil. However, anti-goitrogenic properties of SCN depends on normal iodine ingestion (Fig. 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1429":"5982 of children living in Kielce district, aged 6.5-14.5 years were randomly selected for the study.

In all 16 patients the serum hormonal concentrations (LH, FSH and estradiol) were measured with radioimmunological methods. The bone densitometry was performed in all of them using the single-energy computed tomography (QCT) with the computer Picker 1200. Bone mineral density was measured in three lumbar vertebra (L1-L3) and expressed in milligrams K2HPO4 per ml. The bone mineral density (BMD) was statistically significantly higher in the estrogen treated group (Group I) in every vertebra compared with that of controls (Group II). The serum FSH concentration was statistically significantly lower in the ERT group (Group I) and a statistically significant correlation between FSH level and average BMD (Lmean) was present. 1. the ERT is very efficacious in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women; 2. measurement of BMD in lumbar vertebra L1 or L3 may be a sufficiently reliable and accurate, cost-effective and time-saving method of screening for osteoporosis; 3. the serum FSH determination seems to be useful in monitoring of the estrogen therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis.

TRH 0.2 mg iv blunted GH response to L-dopa 0.5 g p.o. in normal subjects with peak GH values 13.1 and 7.3 micrograms\/l, p &lt; 0.05. In the diabetics no inhibitory effect of TRH was demonstrated and GH was even paradoxically increased after TRH: 14.9 and 21.9 micrograms\/l, p = NS. Lack of inhibitory effect of TRH was more pronounced in patients with proliferative retinopathy. It is concluded that TRH has no inhibitory effect on L-dopa-induced GH response in diabetic subjects. This finding provides further evidence for disturbed GH regulation in diabetes mellitus.","1440":"The aim of the study was the evaluation of growth hormone secretion under physiologic conditions in two groups of type I diabetics: responding and nonresponding to TRH stimulation. Both groups matched for age and metabolic control of diabetes were studied during 24-hours and after GHRH stimulation. The whole diabetic group (n = 18) showed circadian rhythm of GH secretion with mesor value of 4.03 micrograms\/l. TRH-responders had lower mesor GH value than TRH-nonresponders: 3.53 vs. 5.32, p &lt; 0.05. GH response to GHRH was almost identical in both groups. C-peptide level was lower in TRH-responders: 0.16 vs. 0.56 microgram\/l, p &lt; 0.05. No correlation was found between growth hormone response and HbA1 and C-peptide levels. It is concluded that type I diabetics responding to TRH stimulation are characterized by lower mean 24-hour GH levels and lower C-peptide values.","1441":"Authors present a case of glucocorticoid suppressible hyperaldosteronism in 18 year old female. Unmeasurable low plasma renin activity and marked increase in aldosterone concentration was established. After administration of dexamethasone, normalization of aldosterone concentration and blood pressure has been observed.","1442":"In the last 7 years 64 patients (48 women, 16 men, aged 25-75 yrs) with incidentally found asymptomatic adrenal tumours have been observed in the Department of Endocrinology. In 11 patients a routine clinical investigations revealed metastatic tumours at the adrenal glands. In the remaining 53 patients the diameter of the adrenal tumours was &lt; or = 3 cm. Only two of them were treated surgically; the rest has been observed regularly and ultrasonographic examinations have been repeated every 3 to 6 months. Twenty three patients with adrenal tumours &lt; 3 cm of diameter were treated by surgery. The macroscopical examination revealed adrenal cortical adenoma in 11 cases, adrenocortical carcinoma in seven, and pheochromocytoma in 5 patients. The investigation of the pituitary-adrenal system (urinary excretion of 17-OHCS before and during dexamethasone administration, 17-KS, \"free\" corticosteroids, plasma ACTH, cortisol and S-DHA levels) did not reveal any abnormality except that in 10 patients the plasma ACTH concentration was low, especially in the morning. These values were significantly lower as compared with the remaining patients and with control group. One of the possible interpretations is a pituitary suppression by only periodically increased concentrations of the corticosteroids.","1443":"Correlation analysis was used to investigate the interrelation between plasma ACTH and serum cortisol concentrations determined at 8:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 22:00 h in 48 patients bilaterally adrenalectomized for Cushing's disease, including 23 patients with a pituitary adenoma (Nelson's syndrome). In the patients without evidence of a pituitary adenoma a significant inverse correlation was found at 8:00, 16:00, 22:00 h and additionally when all the pairs of estimations were analyzed. In a full-blown Nelson's syndrome an inverse correlation was not proved (p = 0.05). During remission in Nelson's syndrome an inverse correlation between cortisol and ACTH concentrations was stated at 8:00 h and after the evaluation of all the pairs of estimations. The results of our studies have shown that exogenous cortisol exerts a partial inhibitory action on ACTH secretion in patients bilaterally adrenalectomized for Cushing's disease. In active Nelson's syndrome this influence is questionable, it comes however into prominence during remission.","1444":"A case of 55 years old woman with \"hot\" right lobe toxic thyroid nodule, presenting with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and therefore treated with 131I 666MBq (18 mCi) is described. After six years she became pyrexic and suffered of severe cough proxyisms. The fine needle biopsy of the above nodule showed the presence of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Strumectomy followed by local radiotherapy resulted in complete disappearence of all symptoms. The microscopic of the removed thyroid tissue confirmed the above diagnosis. After 22 months' observation the patient remained in good general condition. The possible reasons for the development of the thyroid carcinoma in this case are discussed.","1445":"To compare an efficacy of the galenic form of desiccated thyroid gland--Thyreoideum \"Polfa\" with the synthetic L-thyroxine (Eltroxin Glaxo) in the treatment of hypothyroidism 15 patients were investigated. In all 15 cases before and after treatment ECG and the serum concentrations of cholesterol, thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) as well as thyrotropin (TSH) in response to TRH were performed. After the treatment with Thyreoideum \"Polfa\" in doses 0.2 to 0.6 mg\/daily there were neither clinical improvement, normalization of ECG, the serum concentrations of cholesterol, T3, T4 nor TSH. However, after the L-thyroxine treatment (Eltroxin Glaxo) in doses 100 to 200 micrograms\/daily the clinical signs of hypothyroidism disappeared in all 15 patients. In ECG the statistically significant increase in voltage of the R and T waves after L-thyroxine treatment were observed. Also a significant decrease in the serum concentration of cholesterol and an increase in T4 and T3 were found. The serum concentration of TSH in response to TRH after the L-thyroxine treatment significantly decreased. L-thyroxine appeared to be a very efficacious in the treatment either primary or secondary hypothyroidism.","1446":"The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the clinical classification of hyperthyroidism based on the 3-degree score system and T3 and T4 serum concentration. 161 patients with Graves disease or toxic goiter were studied. By comparing the number of scores separating the 3 subgroups in relation to the severity of disease with T3 and T4 serum concentration of tyreotoxic patients we found a very high statistically significant correlation. We also found the marked (by +50%) statistically significant increase in the serum T3 concentration related to the degree of hyperthyroidism severity.","1447":"There is no, so far, a rational method of therapy based upon the etiology of autoimmune Graves' ophthalmopathy. As a malignant Graves' ophthalmopathy we defined the most severe eye changes leading to the sight loss or permanent disability of vision which are classified as exceeded class 3c according to the eye changes classification of the American Thyroid Association [27]. The aim of the study was to develop the most efficacious method of therapy for malignant Graves' ophthalmopathy. The material consisted of 206 patients treated according to the 3-stage method: 1-st--corticotherapy, 2-nd--radiotherapy, including linear accelerator, 3-rd--orbital decompression. Moreover, in four patients plasmapheresis was applied and in additional five cyclosporine was administered. In all 206 patients the estimation of the results of the treatment was based on the Donaldson ophthalmopathy index [4]. It has been proved that corticotherapy combined with linear accelerator radiotherapy has been the most efficacious method of treatment. It has also the least number of side effects. Orbital decompression as the 3-rd stage of treatment was employed in those cases in which the previous two stages of medical therapy were unsuccessful.","1448":"Neurotensin is a tridecapeptide, present in the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract in man and animals. The affect of orally administered ethanol (1 g\/kg body weight) on the neurotensin secretion over 24 hr period was studied in eight young healthy men. No significant circadian rhythm of neurotensin secretion was detected in the eight subjects studied. Ethanol produced a progressive rise in the plasma level of neurotensin reaching a maximum at 12:00 (13.8 +\/- 8.6 pmol\/l). At 12:00 and 14:00, the neurotensin concentrations were significantly higher than on the placebo day (p &lt; 0.05). The secretion rate of neurotensin was determined approximately using the area under the curve method. Ethanol produced a transient rise in neurotensin secretion over the first 12 hrs period (08:00-20:00 h) after its administration (p &lt; 0.02). The observation that ethanol increases transiently the neurotensin secretion in man supports the hypothesis that neurotensin may be involved in the biological effect of ethanol. The source of its secretion remains to be elucidated.","1449":"Majority of pituitary tumours secrete one of the named hormones: PRL, GH, ACTH, proopiomelanocortine, alpha and beta subunit of TSH, LH, and FSH. Some of those tumours secrete two or more hormones. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of bromocriptine (Parlodel MR and LAR) upon secretion of hormones and tumour size in 10 patients with mixed pituitary tumours. In all patients pituitary and peripheral hormones, CT scan and visual fields were examined before and after treatment with bromocriptine: Parlodel MR and LAR. Bromocriptine treatment decreased PRL secretion in all 10 patients; GH--in all 6 in whom it was increased; TSH--in 2, FSH--in 2 and alpha-subunit in all 6 in whom they were increased. In 5 patients treatment resulted in shrinkage of the tumour mass by 20 to 35%. In all examined subjects clinical improvement was achieved. Our results demonstrate that bromocriptine (Parlodel MR and LAR) is very effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with mixed pituitary tumours particularly those with hyperprolactinemia.","1450":"In order to assess the efficacy and tolerability of new long acting bromocriptine: Parlodel MR (oral form) and Parlodel LAR (injectable form suitable for repeatable administration) 40 patients (29 women and 11 men) with pituitary tumours with hyperprolactinemia (PRL 70 micrograms\/l) were investigated in a double blind study. Patients were divided into 2 groups of 20. In the first group Parlodel R or Parlodel MR in equivalent doses was given, the other group was administered Parlodel R or Parlodel LAR. During the next 6 months 20 patients were treated with Parlodel MR and the other 20 with Parlodel LAR. In all patients pituitary and peripheral hormones, CT scan and visual fields were examined before and after 28 days of bromocriptine treatment. During the next six months 20 patients were treated with Parlodel MR while the other 20 with Parlodel LAR. Serum PRL fell in all patients and values in the normal range were obtained in 36 patients. In 30 out of 35 patients with signs of pituitary tumour in CT scan, a significant tumour shrinkage was observed. Most patients achieved considerable clinical improvement: disappearance of galactorrhoea, resumed menses in women, increased potency in men. There were no difference in efficacy in Parlodel R, Parlodel MR and Parlodel LAR, but in the case of Parlodel LAR the least number of side effects was found. Treatment with long acting bromocriptine-Parlodel MR and LAR of patients with pituitary tumours with hyperprolactinemia is an efficacious, safe and better tolerated method than Parlodel R treatment.","1451":"Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is now considered to be a prolactin-releasing factor (PRF). The aim of this study was to determine the VIP concentration in peripheral blood in patients with prolactin-secreting adenoma compared to healthy subjects. We also examined the effect of bromocriptine administration on the plasma VIP concentration in patients with prolactinoma. Nine patients with prolactinoma (6 women and 3 men, aged 27-50) and 7 healthy control subjects (4 women and 3 men, aged 26-40) were examined. Blood samples for prolactin and VIP were collected at 06:00, 12:00, 18:00, 24:00. In prolactinoma blood was taken before and after bromocriptine administration. Serum prolactin concentration was determined by the radioimmunoassay. VIP concentration was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay Kit-INCSTAR Corp. (Minnesota, USA). Statistical significance was calculated using the analysis of variance. A single 5 mg oral dose of bromocriptine decreased the mean prolactin concentration during the first 24 hours of treatment. Plasma VIP concentration was higher in prolactinoma patients compared to healthy subjects. There was no change in plasma VIP level after bromocriptine administration. in patients with prolactin secreting adenoma the plasma VIP concentration is increased. ","1452":"Authors present a case of 28-year old female with anterior hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus, with properly functioning anterior pituitary cells as showed by means of measuring pituitary hormones in response to neurohormones i.v. injections. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed neoplastic tissue in the pituitary stalk destroying supraopticohypophysial and paraventriculohypophysial tracts, as well as portal blood system, thus preventing release of vasopressin and these hypothalamic neurohormones from accessing anterior pituitary.","1453":"Hypopituitarism can be a result of various lesions of hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, or of the pituitary gland itself. The aim of the study was to assess the value of CT and MRI examinations in determination of the cause of hypopituitarism. Seventeen patients with hypopituitarism (9 women and 8 men) aged 22 to 61 years have been examined. In three cases growth deficiency was observed, 4 women had galactorrhoea, 4 patients had diabetes insipidus, 16 patients had supra-adrenal insufficiency, 14 had signs of hypogonadism and 10 hypothyroidism. In each case plasma concentrations of LH, FSH, PRL, TSH, alpha-subunit, ACTH before and after appropriate stimulation with TRH, metoclopramid, LH-RH, GRF or metyrapon were determined with RIA. Every patient was examined both with CT and MRI (0.5 T Toshiba MRT 50a). All 17 patients had abnormal MR images of hypothalamo-pituitary area, while only 10 of them had abnormalities in their CT scans. In remaining 7 patients the MRI revealed: three cases of congenital malformation of hypophyseal stalk, two cases of empty sella, one posttraumatic lesion of the stalk and one case of granulomatous infiltration of the stalk. We found MRI superior to CT in establishing the case of hypopituitarism.","1454":"","1455":"The studies included 64 children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, aged from 6 to 15 years of life. In 25 children with partial and secondary generalized seizures monotherapy with carbamazepine was introduced; in 19 children with primary generalized seizures--with phenobarbital, and in patients with both types of seizures--with primidone. Monotherapy was controlled by means of blood serum drug concentration level monitoring; the therapy was successful in all the children. The group did not include patients with mental retardation, and epilepsy was idiopathic. Prior to the institution of treatment, a single determination of blood serum triiodothyronine, thyroxine, TSH, prolactin, cortisol, LH and testosterone was made. Psychological test were carried out employing Wechsler's scale, Bender-Santucci test, rhythmic structures developed by Mira Stambak and test of manual dexterity (card display). In order to evaluate short-term effects of the employed drugs upon the blood serum concentration values of the studied hormones, a repeated determination was made one month after the initiation of therapy. The third determination was made one year after the onset of treatment in order to assess the long-term effects. The effect of drugs upon their cognitive functions was assessed in a follow-up psychological testing performed after one year of therapy. The studies combined with statistical analysis led to a conclusion that after one month of monotherapy there occurred a significant drop in thyroxine concentration levels, still augmented after one year. Patients treated with carbamazepine showed a significant decrease of T3 levels after one month and one year, whereas treatment with phenobarbital and primidone did not result in significant changes of T3 concentration. Yet, T3 and T4 concentration values did not exceed normal limits. No type of monotherapy resulted in significant long-term changes of TSH concentration levels. No clinical signs of hypothyroidism nor goiter were observed in the studied children. After one month of monotherapy with carbamazepine and phenobarbital there was observed a significant increase of prolactin and cortisol levels, which was absent after one year. The values observed did lie within normal limits. No significant changes were observed with respect to the effect of the studied drugs upon blood serum LH and testosterone levels. After a one-year monotherapy with primidone the children revealed a significant improvement of results measured on performance scale and by means of a full Wechsler scale. Carbamazepine and phenobarbital did not affect the intelligence quotient of the studied children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1456":"The aim of this work was to characterise the eye muscle antigens reacting with autoantibodies from Graves ophthalmopathy patients to elucidate the function of these antibodies. As estimated by ELISA test antibodies of IgG class reacting with porcine microsomal membranes are present in about 25% of patients while of IgM class in about 15% of patients with Graves ophthalmopathy. Their presence do not correlate with ophthalmopathy index, neither they have relation to treatment. Anti eye muscle antibodies were present at some stages of the disease in three patients who develop ophthalmopathy, from the group of 26 patients treated during one year for hyperthyroidism. However, sporadically these antibodies were found also in about 20% of patients with Hashimoto disease, Lupus erythematosus or Scleroderma. Some of them cross react with antigens of skeletal muscle and liver. Eye muscle antigens reacting with patients antibodies are localised in plasma membranes and in membranes of smooth reticulum. Affinity purification of solubilised porcine eye muscle membrane proteins on a column with immunoglobulins from pooled serum of patients resulted in 23 fold purification of the antigen. The sensitivity of ELISA was not significantly increased by the use of affinity purified antigen, however some of previously negative ophthalmopathy sera gave positive reaction. Porcine eye muscle membrane proteins were separated by SDS PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The reactions of electroblotted proteins with sera from patients with Graves ophthalmopathy and also sera from healthy controls shown very complex pattern. There was not a single antigen or antigens reacting only with antibodies present in sera of ophthalmopathy patients and not in controls. Patients sera reacted more often than control sera with an antigen of about 40 kDa. The reaction of sera from some patients with proteins about 100, 70 and 65 kDa were stronger than between these proteins and control sera. No changes in the pattern of reaction between antibodies and eye muscle antigens were noticed in serum of the same Graves' patient with or without ophthalmopathy during one year follow up and treatment, regardless of clinical course of the disease. When human eye muscle membrane fractions from tissue obtained during strabismus repair or at autopsy was used for immunoblotting, smaller number of proteins reacted with autoantibodies. Again there was no single antigen or antigens reacting with antibodies from sera of all Graves ophthalmopathy patients. Sera of some patients reacted with antigens about 50 kDa, not recognized by controls. The results of present study show, that the anti eye muscle antibodies are present in some of Graves ophthalmopathy patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1457":"","1458":"","1459":"","1460":"A case of rare association of hyperparathyroidism with fully developed hyperthyroidism appearing in a woman 23 years old with advanced generalized cystic fibrosis has been presented.","1461":"The effect of ether stress and dexamethasone on hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis was investigated in sexually mature male Wistar rats. Separate group of rats was subjected to ether stress during 2 minutes. The remaining animals were treated with dexamethasone during 7 days. CRF-immunoreactive and vasopressin-immunoreactive neurons were detected within paraventricular nuclei and median eminence by using specific antibodies. Body weight of the rats as well as the weights of pituitary and adrenal glands were also measured. The levels of ACTH and corticosterone were determined in blood serum. It was found that the ether stress caused a considerable decrease in the amount of CRF-immunopositive substances in the outer layer of median eminence and a decrease in the amount of vasopressin-immunoreactive neurocytes in the parvocellular fragment of paraventricular nuclei. Dexamethasone administration caused an increase in the amount of CRF-immunopositive perikaryons within paraventricular nuclei and also an increase in vasopressin-immunopositive nerve fibers in median eminence.","1462":"Circadian rhythm of TSH was analyzed in patients with cold tumors of the thyroid before and after surgical removal of the tumors and in control subjects. By using special computer program BIOR based on harmonic and regression analysis, designed for verifying and comparing various biorhythms, significant differences were found between TSH biorhythms in patients with cold thyroid tumors before and after the operation.","1463":"The effects of prolonged hemodialysis therapy on testosterone secretion have been studied in 41 men with chronic renal insufficiency. Fifteen healthy men served as control group. LH-RH stimulation test was performed in all the studied subjects. It was found that blood serum testosterone concentration is lowered in all the patients with renal insufficiency irrespective of the time of duration of hemodialysis therapy as compared to the control group. In patients dialyzed longer than 50 month testosterone level was higher than in those subjected to shorter period of hemodialysis therapy. Reactivity of testosterone secretion in LH-RH stimulation test was greater in patients dialyzed over 50 months than either in those dialyzed during the shorter period or in the controls.","1464":"Growth rate of five children with vitamin D-dependent rickets was analyzed during the long-term treatment with an active analog of vitamin D3. Considerable increase in growth rate together with the improvement of biochemical values and radiological pattern took place during the initial phase of administration of 1-hydroxyvitamin D3. During the maintenance treatment of long duration with 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 both the acceleration of growth and catch-up growth persisted. However, in 4 among 5 children studied an inhibition of growth was observed during different periods of time. Only in one boy was this connected with the conclusion of the process of physiological growth. In three remaining children a slow-down in growth rate appeared during the pre-pubertal period or was the effect of lowering the dose of 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 as an countermeasure to hypercalciuria. In such cases inhibition of growth was caused by the administration of too small a dose of 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 in relation to the requirement. In all cases the appearance of biochemical features of rickets aggravation, such as low blood serum phosphate concentration and elevated alkaline phosphatase activity, preceded the observable inhibition of growth. The results obtained allow us to conclude that the inhibition of growth observed during the long-term treatment of rickets with 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 may be regarded as the first signal of inadequate dosage of 1-hydroxy vitamin D3.","1465":"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was injected intravenously at a dose of 10 micrograms in spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. In order to evaluate the hemodynamic and hormonal effects of this peptide, the mean arterial pressure, heart rate as well as a serum rLH and rPRL levels, the contents of LH-RH in hypothalamus and the content of LH in pituitary tissue were determined. The same procedure was applied in rats receiving placebo. Serum rPRL concentration was measured additionally after combined administration of VIP+dopamine. VIP injection produced a decrease in mean arterial pressure and an increase in heart rate in both spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats. Serum rPRL concentration was significantly increased at 10 minutes after injection. The combined therapy (VIP+dopamine) partially inhibited this response. Serum rLH concentration, the content of LH-RH in hypothalamic tissue as well as the content of pituitary LH after VIP injection in spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats did not differ from the values obtained for the control group. 1. VIP injection produced the dramatic hypotensive effects in hypertensive rats; 2. A marked increase in PRL concentration in response to VIP was partially inhibited by dopamine in hypertensive and normotensive rats; 3. VIP injection did not change LH-RH and LH release in both hypertensive and normotensive rats. ","1466":"The levels of the following blood serum lipid constituents: total cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, HDL-cholesterol, apolipoproteins AI, AII and B, and lipoprotein fractions have been determined in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes in relation to sex, age, duration of diabetes, coexistence of obesity, insulin dosage and history of genetic predispositions. The age of the patients was between 1.3 and 22 years and the duration of the disease ranged between 3 months and 15 years. The analysis of the results revealed that sex, age, daily insulin dose and the known genetic predispositions have no influence on the values of the parameters of lipid metabolism. However, an increase in the levels of cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoproteins AI and B was observed along with the progressing duration of the disease. An increase in the levels of cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and beta-lipoprotein, and a decrease in the level of alpha-lipoprotein have been found in diabetic children with coexisting obesity. The above analysis indicates that besides metabolic control of diabetes its duration and accompanying obesity may negatively influence the course of the disease contributing to the precocious development of atherosclerosis.","1467":"The levels of the following blood serum lipid constituents: total cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, HDL-cholesterol, lipoprotein fractions, as well as apolipoproteins AI, AII and B, have been determined in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes lasting from 3 months to 15 years in relation to the degree of metabolic control characterized by the levels of fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c. The group of patients having the level of HbA1c exceeding 10% was characterized by significantly higher levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and Apo-B, and lower content of alpha-lipoprotein as compared to the group with HbA1c level beneath 10%. When fructosamine concentration was considered as an index of metabolic control of diabetes, it was found that the levels of cholesterol, phospholipids and apolipoproteins apo-A and apo-AI are highest in the group with the poor metabolic control and differ significantly from the respective values found in patients with mediocre and good metabolic control. Considering biological role of the individual lipids and lipoproteins, it should be stressed that the proper control of glycaemia is important for preventing the development of atherosclerosis in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes.","1468":"The levels of lipoprotein A-I (LP A-I) containing apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and devoid of apolipoprotein A-II (apo A-II) have been determined in a group of 86 children and adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes of age between 1.3 and 22 years. The duration of diabetes in the studied group ranged between 0.25 and 15 years. The patients studied were further divided into subgroups taking into account the duration of diabetes as well as the occurrence of complications of diabetes, obesity and predisposition to early development of atherosclerosis in family history. The analysis of the results took into account the relations between the levels of LP A-I and other parameters of lipid metabolism like cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, apo A-I and apo A-II concentrations as well as the effectiveness of metabolic control of diabetes. LP A-I concentration was the lowest in group of children with diabetes lasting up to one year. This parameter was correlated positively with the levels of HDL-cholesterol and apo A-I, and negatively with HbA1c. It was not related to the coexisting complications, obesity or predisposition to atherosclerosis in family history. The above results indicate that the state of metabolic control of diabetes significantly influences the level of LP A-I. Considering the importance of LP A-I in preventing atherosclerosis it should be stressed that a decrease in its level during the period of prolonged hypoglycemia constitutes still another risk factor for development of atherosclerosis in diabetic children and adolescents.","1469":"","1470":"","1471":"The optimal conditions for lyophilization of porcine pituitary glands and isolation of pure prolactin from lyophilized preparation have been investigated. The isolation method consisted in the extraction of crude pituitary preparation with acidified acetone followed by precipitation of crude prolactin preparation (acid acetone powder) by increasing the concentration of acetone in the extract to 92%. Further purification of prolactin was achieved by fractional precipitation at varying pH values and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 column in a pH 7.5 phosphate buffer. This final procedure resulted in obtaining the monomeric form of prolactin. The identity of the isolated hormone was confirmed by spectrophotometric and radioimmunological methods as well as by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.","1472":"The effect of chronic metoclopramide administration (for 10 days at a daily dose of 5 mg\/kg body weight subcutaneously) on cell proliferation in spleen and in thymus was investigated. Cell proliferation was evaluated by the stathmokinetic method with the use of vincristine. It was found that metoclopramide administration results in a statistically significant increase in the value of the mean mitotic activity rate index (MMAR) of splenocytes in the areas around arteries. At the same time no statistically significant changes were demonstrated in the MMAR index values obtained for splenocytes present in the germinal centers of the spleen. No significant changes in the MMAR index could also be found for thymocytes.","1473":"Normal endothelin 1\/2 levels and their correlation with age were evaluated. For clinical application of the endothelin 1\/2 RIA test, optimum storage conditions were investigated. Plasma endothelin 1\/2 (ET) levels were measured in 36 healthy blood donors, mostly males, of mean age 36 +\/- 8 years, subdivided into three age groups: 17-30, 31-40 and above 40 years old. The mean normal ET levels in the three age groups, and corresponding standard deviations, were: 0.58 +\/- 0.19, 0.62 +\/- 0.31, and 0.80 +\/- 0.28 fmol\/ml, respectively. The mean ET level for the whole normal population was 0.66 +\/- 0.28 fmol\/ml. Only differences between mean ET levels for the first and last groups were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Differences between mean ET levels in smokers (53% of total population) and non-smokers, women and men, irrespective of age, were found not to be statistically significant. At this stage of our work, we conclude that other factors than age alone play a role in enhancing ET levels above the age of 41 years. In our study of optimum storage conditions for endothelin 1\/2, we found that after one week of storage at -24 degrees C the mean level of ET measured in frozen plasma dropped to 85% of the initial activity, while after the same period the respective decrease in ET activity in frozen extracts was 49%. Over the next two weeks, ET levels in plasma and extracts dropped to 57% and 32% of \"zero time\" activities, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1474":"The thermal dehydration test was performed in 12 patients with renal transplant and in 20 healthy subjects. The study was aimed at the evaluation of the effect of volume regulating hormones on electrolyte composition of thermal sweat in patients with renal transplant. Blood plasma renin activity (PRA) as well as plasma concentrations of aldosterone (ALD), vasopressin (AVP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were determined before and after thermal dehydration in all the subjects studied. In all the subjects sweat was also collected after 15 and 45 minutes of exposition to heat and the concentrations of sodium, potassium and chloride were determined in all sweat samples. Significantly elevated PRA and ANP concentrations and significantly lowered plasma AVP concentrations but normal ALD levels were found before thermal dehydration test in all the patients with renal transplant. After the exposition to heat lasting 1 hour the direction of changes was similar, their magnitude was, however, different in renal transplant patients than in healthy subjects. In addition, lower concentrations of sodium and chloride in thermal sweat and lower total concentration of sweat solids were found in renal transplant patients than in healthy controls. No significant correlation was found between the plasma concentrations of the hormones determined and the electrolyte concentrations of thermal sweat both in the renal transplant patients and in healthy subjects. The results suggest that the volume regulating hormones have no effect on the electrolyte composition of thermal sweat induced by short exposition to heat both in renal transplant patients and in healthy subjects.","1475":"The effect of calcitonin on TRH-induced secretion of thyrotropin was studied in 15 subjects with normal thyroid function.

An increase in blood serum T4 concentration and transient increase (only during the first three months of treatment) in TSH concentration have been observed in almost all the patients studied. Clinically evident form of hyperthyroidism was found only in one female patient. In two patients the changes in hormone concentrations suggesting hyperthyroidism were not accompanied by clinical manifestations, and in four patients there was no clinical hypothyroidism despite hormone levels suggesting such a state. In addition to the determinations of T3, T4 and TSH also the results of TRH-TSH test played an important role in diagnosing both hypo- and hyperthyroidism.","1477":"Forty one patients with familial non-insulin-dependent diabetes (type 2) were included into the study. The fragment of insulin gene including the sequences coding for beta chain and part of C-peptide as well as 5'untranslated region was amplified in vitro by using the polymerase chain reaction. The digestion of the fragments by using the restriction enzyme Pst I followed by electrophoretic separation allowed to recognize the alpha and beta alleles of insulin gene. The investigations have shown that the beta allele occurs more frequently in diabetic patients than in healthy control subjects (P &lt; 0.05).","1478":"The activity of Ca(++)-Mg++ ATP-ase present in erythrocyte membranes was determined in basal conditions and following stimulation with calmodulin in 8 women with insulin-dependent diabetes and in 9 healthy women. The isolation of erythrocyte membranes and the determination of activity of Ca(++)-Mg(++)-ATP-ase were carried out according to the method of Gietzen et al. A decrease in the activity of Ca(++)-Mg(++)-ATP-ase in basal conditions was found in fractions with the highest erythrocyte content obtained from diabetic patients. After stimulation with calmodulin the activity of Ca(++)-Mg(++)-ATP-ase in all the fractions was lower in diabetic patients than in the controls. Low activities of the enzyme were accompanied by high values of HbA1c. The results suggest that glycosylation of the ATP-ase or\/and calmodulin may be the main cause of the observed fall in the enzyme activity in diabetes. Also the disturbances concerning the cumulation of intracellular calcium may be related to the changes caused by glycosylation of Ca(++)-Mg(++)-ATP-ase or\/and calmodulin.","1479":"The mechanism of thyroxine uptake by human adipocyte precursors has been studied in primary culture. Also the rates of transport of this hormone into the isolated cells of adipose tissue were compared for lean and obese subjects. It was demonstrated that thyroxine transport into the human adipocyte precursor cells is an active, energy-dependent process characterized by very low rate (Km = 10 pmol\/l, Vmax = 8 fmol FT4\/10(6) cells\/min.). By comparing the rates of thyroxine transport into the precursor cells of adipocytes isolated from adipose tissue of lean and obese subjects it was possible to demonstrate a clear tendency to the lowered rate of transport of thyroxine to the cells in obesity. The results of this study suggest that the lowered rate of thyroxine transport to preadipocytes and adipocytes observed in obesity may significantly influence the metabolic state of these cells.","1480":"","1481":"","1482":"The properness of diagnosing the premature menarche as isolated clinical syndrome is often questioned. A long-term observation od 2 girls with premature menarche has been described. A discussion is presented about the role of imbalance within the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonads axis and the role of disturbances in peripheral responsiveness to sex hormones in the patho-mechanism of premature menarche.","1483":"The effects of the active gastrin fragments, penta- and tetragastrin on the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into the rat pituitary tumoral cells were investigated in vitro. The significant stimulation of 3H-thymidine incorporation was observed as an effect of the investigated substances. The putative role of gastrin as an autocrine growth factor active in pituitary tumorigenesis was discussed.","1484":"A method consisting in the catheterization of lower petrosal sinuses aimed at obtaining blood samples for the determination of ACTH concentration has been applied in diagnostically difficult cases of Cushing's disease. The appearance of ACTH concentration gradient between the blood originating from the immediate vicinity of pituitary and the peripheral venous blood confirmed the hypophyseal etiology of hypercortisolemia. The gradient of ACTH concentration between the two petrosal sinuses made possible the localization of a microadenoma in the anterior lobe of pituitary. The diagnostic conclusions obtained by the above method have been confirmed during the surgery.","1485":"A cytoskeletal protein--tubulin was isolated from the cerebral tissue by the sequential microtubule polymerization and depolymerization technique described by Schelansky. The purity of the isolated protein was verified by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The binding reaction with monoclonal antibodies against various cytoskeletal proteins confirmed the presence of pure tubulin. The isolated tubulin was used as reactant in a solid phase radioimmunoassay for the detection of antitubulin antibodies in tubulin-coated plastic tubes. Antitubulin antibody assays were performed in 20 cases of hypothyroidism and 56 cases of Graves' disease. In 70 percent of cases of hypothyroidism and 50 percent of cases of Graves' disease the levels of antitubulin autoantibodies were elevated. The highest titres of antibodies had some patients with Graves' disease. The antitubulin autoantibodies were of the IgM class.","1486":"The study was aimed at the evaluation of treatment of hypothyroidism with L-thyroxine administration monitored by the determination of T3 and T4 concentrations. The investigations were carried out in a group of 57 patients with hypothyroidism including 37 patients with autoimmune etiology of hypothyroidism, 12 patients after strumectomy and 8 patients after treatment with 131J. The administration of L-thyroxine at a dose of 2 micrograms\/kg\/day effectively eradicated all symptoms of the disease and led to the normalization of blood serum T3 and T4 values in the majority of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism. So the majority of women required the daily dose of L-thyroxine of 100-150 micrograms, and the majority of men 125-175 micrograms. Lower dosage of L-thyroxine (50-100 micrograms daily) was required to attain euthyroid state in some patients with postoperative or postradiation hypothyroidism. Monitoring of the therapy by the determination of blood serum T3 and T4 concentrations greatly facilitated the proper choice of the therapeutic dose of L-thyroxine as the return of the thyroid hormone concentrations to normal usually brought about the complete remission of symptoms of the disease. The exception from this rule was only in the case of patients with arterial hypertension and coronary disease in whom, because of the side-effects, lower dosage of L-thyroxine (usually 50 micrograms daily) must have been applied to attain the optimal improvement. The treatment with L-thyroxine caused much less side-effects as compared to the therapy using the dessicated thyroid preparations (Thyroideum).","1487":"Results of chemotherapy applied in 23 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer are presented. Chemotherapy combined with local treatment is a suggested therapy for treatment the locally advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer.","1488":"From 1985 to 1991 there were 5889 fine-needle aspiration biopsies of thyroid performed in our laboratory. 703 cytological diagnoses based on biopsy specimens taken from 679 patients, were compared with the results of postoperative histopathological examinations. There were 14% non-diagnostic biopsies. The statistical analysis was performed considering difficulties in differentiation between follicular adenomas and follicular carcinomas. Difficulties in evaluation of biopsies of cystic lesions were also considered. The results of cytological and histopathological examinations were agreeing with one another in 88% cases. In regard to diagnosis of malignant neoplasms, the sensitivity of the cytological investigation was equal to 63% and the specificity equaled to 90%. While considering detection of papillary carcinomas, the sensitivity was equal to 67%. Our results are in a compliance with the view, that the fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a useful method in a preoperative diagnosis of thyroid lesions.","1489":"The study comprised 65 women (mean age 43 years) with the recurrent goiter after subtotal strumectomy. All patients were subjected to ultrasonographic examination using a sonograph Sonoline LM (Siemens) with 7.5 MHz head. The study was aimed at: 1) assessment of etiology of goiter recurrence, 2) assessment of changes in the thyroid parenchyma, 3) detection of the occurrence of heterogeneous structures, such as nodules, cysts and calcifications. It was found that goiter recurrence appeared mainly in the patients subjected to surgery because of neutral nodular goiter. The observed changes in the thyroid stump, such as heterogeneous structure of parenchyma, generalized cyst-like spaces and nodular structures mainly of mixed type or of solid, normo-echogenic or hyper-echogenic type, were associated with high levels of THS and the presence of antithyroid antibodies in blood serum. In patients with evidently high TSH levels and positive with respect to occurrence of antithyroid antibodies, the nodular structures were more numerous and of larger size. In can be concluded that ultrasonography provides a valuable noninvasive tool for the evaluation of morphological structure of the recurrent goiter.","1490":"The study was aimed at investigating the occurrence of thyroid autoantibodies (ATMA and TGA) in persons inhabiting the area of goiter endemy of mild degree. The survey comprised 1508 persons of age ranging from 3 to 68 years. The subjects studied have been divided into the groups taking into account age, sex, degree of thyroid enlargement (according to WHO, 1974), and the characteristics of the goiter. The occurrence of ATMA or TGA antibodies was demonstrated in 17% of the subjects. An increase in the incidence and titer of thyroid autoantibodies with age was observed. The occurrence of thyroid autoantibodies was observed more frequently in the subjects with parenchymatous goiter. No correlation was found between the incidence of the antibodies and goiter size. Thyroid autoantibodies have also been found in 10% of subjects without goiter. The results obtained do not indicate convincingly the role of the thyroid autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of endemic goiter.","1491":null,"1492":"The survey carried out in 1990 covering the population of Sejny community, sponsored by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, program MZXVII, demonstrated the occurrence of goiter in 33.6% of studied persons. Such an incidence can rightly be recognized as an endemy. Predominance of cases with small or moderate enlargement of the thyroid (OB and I), low percentage of nodules (18%), and 2.8 times more frequent occurrence of goiter in women allows o characterize the endemy as mild. The percentage of goiter in this population does not differ from that found in this area before the Chernobyl disaster. However a small increase in the incidence of thyroid enlargement in a group of boys of age between 17 and 19 years, and an increase in percentage of nodular goiter in whole population was noted. The questionnaire studies confirmed in addition a high effectiveness of mass iodine prophylaxis introduced after the atomic disaster, especially in the population of developmental age. However, because of the latency period concerning the possible effects, the results obtained will be verified in the course of long-term prospective studies.","1493":"The study was aimed at the evaluation of incidence of goiter in the population of the community of Sejny. The survey comprising 1520 subjects revealed the presence of thyroid enlargement in 31.8% of the subjects studied, indicating the occurrence of a mild endemy. The facts speaking for this type of endemy are: predominance of cases with goiter of OB or I degree (83%), higher incidence of goiter in women than in men (3.3 times), occurrence of nodular goiter in 12% of cases with goiter, and sporadic appearance of hypothyroidism. Goiter endemy in the population of this area can be attributed to such goitrogenic factors as low level of iodine and high content of calcium in the water, tobacco smoking, and a habit of drinking tap water.","1494":"","1495":"In our previous study we showed that alcohol disturbed the circadian rhythms of LH, testosterone and its conversion to DHT. To determine the effect of LH-RH on pituitary-gonadal function before and after alcohol, 11 male volunteers aged 24-29 years (mean 25.5) were investigated. Blood for hormonal estimations was withdrawn before and 20, 30, 60, and 120 min after LH-RH. In every case, the LH-RH test was performed twice: 6 hours after placebo and, a week later, 6 hours after alcohol administered orally, in dose of 1.0 g\/kg bw. The LH, FSH, alpha-subunit and testosterone concentrations were measured with radioimmunological methods. It was shown that alcohol significantly inhibited LH (p &lt; 0.05), alpha-subunit (p &lt; 0.02) and testosterone (p &lt; 0.001) response to LH-RH stimulation, but not that of FSH. ","1496":"The radioimmunoassay of alpha-subunit adapted in our laboratory was widely evaluated. Three different antisera (anti-pituitary alpha-subunit, anti-alpha-TSH and anti-alpha-hCG), the labelled preparations of pituitary alpha-subunit and alpha-hCG, and cross-reactivity with intact glycoprotein hormones (MRC standards of LH, FSH, hCG and TSH) were tested for their potential influence on the results of the assay. The basal levels of alpha-subunit were measured in 48 healthy young men, 48 normally menstruating women, 33 menopausal women, 37 pregnant women and 70 patients with pituitary adenoma. In addition a possibility of pulsatile secretion of alpha-subunit was investigated in 9 healthy young women, the ranges of alpha-subunit concentrations found were as follow (means +\/- SD): 1.2 +\/- 0.4 micrograms\/l--in young men, 1.1 +\/- 0.4 micrograms\/l--in young women, 3.2 +\/- 0.7 micrograms\/l--in postmenopausal women, 1-54 micrograms\/l--in pregnant women, and between 2.6 and 44.0 micrograms\/l in 14 of 70 patients with pituitary adenoma. There were good correlations of results for 3 different antisera and their cross-reactivity with LH, FSH, hCG and TSH were just as low. In conclusion, the alpha-subunit assay appears clinically useful and should be widely applied in routine endocrinological diagnostics.","1497":"The effects of hyperthyreosis induced by the administration of thyroxine and hypothyreosis induced by the administration of methimazole on the levels of tryptophane, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in low-platelet blood plasma have been studied in Wistar rats. Thyroxine administration (120 micrograms\/kg\/24 h, intraperitoneally) lasting 7 days caused a decrease in serotonin concentration by 38 per cent. The level of this amine in rats receiving thyroxine during three months was elevated by almost three times. Tryptophane concentration did not change following thyroxine administration. Methimazole administration lasting 14 days (oral dose 15 mg\/kg\/24 h) caused an increase in tryptophane concentration by 34 per cent and in serotonin concentration by 24 per cent. Long-term hypothyreosis induced by methimazole administration lasting three months caused an 39 per cent increase in tryptophane and 38 per cent increase in serotonin concentration. Neither hyperthyreosis induced by thyroxine administration nor hypothyreosis induced by methimazole++ caused any changes in the concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The importance of serotonin in pathogenesis of clinical symptoms accompanying the states of deficit or excess of thyroid hormones needs further elucidation.","1498":"Small but detectable disturbances concerning blood lipid levels manifested by somewhat higher concentrations of LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides as well as higher values of atherogenic indices expressing the ratio of cholesterol present in atherogenic lipoprotein fractions to that present in atheroprotective HDL fraction have been shown to exist in 36 women with polycystic ovary syndrome. HDL-cholesterol concentration was lower in women with polycystic ovary syndrome than in healthy women. The disturbances described above were more pronounced in obese patients. No correlation was found between the disturbances in lipid levels and hormonal disturbances particularly hyperandrogenemia.","1499":"Hypocalcemic response following the administration of 160 units of porcine calcitonin was investigated in 14 patients with bone lesions caused by myeloma and in 9 control subjects. Significant decrease in blood serum calcium level was found in 85 per cent of myeloma patients, both in those with osteolytic bone lesions and those with generalized osteoporosis. Moreover, in all the patients a significant positive correlation was found between hypocalcemic response and the initial blood serum calcium concentration. Calcitonin administration did not cause any changes in blood serum phosphate level in myeloma patients.","1500":"The acute rejection of kidney transplant is accompanied by kidney ischaemia which in turn is a triggering factor for erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis. It was shown, on the other hand, that during the rejection an increase in blood serum parathormone (PTH) concentration takes place. The present study was aimed at answering the question what is the effect of acute rejection of kidney transplant on blood serum concentrations of EPO i PTH. Seventeen patients with kidney transplant participated in the study. In all the patients the investigations were carried out four times: 1--few days before rejection, 2--after ascertaining that kidney transplant is being rejected, 3--immediately after rejection, and 4--few days after completing the anti-rejection therapy. High doses of methylprednisolone were used as anti-rejection therapy. Control group consisted of 16 healthy persons. Acute rejection of kidney transplant was accompanied by a significant increase in blood serum concentrations of EPO and PTH. After methylprednisolone therapy, normalization of EPO and decrease in PTH concentration were observed in kidney transplant patients. Significant positive correlations were found between EPO and PTH concentrations in blood serum. It was concluded that acute rejection of kidney transplant is characterized by a significant increase in blood serum concentrations of EPO and PTH. Despite the existence of a significant positive correlation between blood serum concentrations of EPO and PTH in patients with kidney transplant, any pathogenic relation between the observed disturbances of secretion of the two hormones seems to be of little probability.","1501":"The study was aimed at the evaluation of propiopromazine (Combelen, Bayer), a derivative of phenothiazine, as an agent lowering in sheep the response to stress. The stress of emotional origin was induced in sheep by the isolation from herd lasting 1 hour. The isolation experiments were repeated 6 times on the same group of sheep, first three isolations (1-3) in daily intervals and next three (4-6) in weekly intervals. Propiopromazine was administered before each isolation experiment. The reaction of sheep to the isolation stress was weaker after propiopromazine administration. This was suggested by smaller increase in blood serum cortisol and glucose levels when compared to sheep subjected to isolation but not receiving the drug. Such effect was especially conspicuous during the course of the first isolation experiment; during the next experiments the difference concerning the reaction to stress between the sheep isolated from the herd receiving and not receiving the drug was gradually diminishing. It was shown in addition that propiopromazine administration to the sheep not subjected to stress caused an increase in cortisol level by 125 per cent and that in glucose level by 35 per cent. These results suggest that propiopromazine administration protects the organism against the effects of emotional stress only partially. Moreover, the effect of its administration gradually weakens with repeating of the stress inducing experiment, and propiopromazine itself may act as a stress inducing factor. It seems therefore that the use of propiopromazine and similar compounds as anti-stress agents may be questionable.","1502":"The occurrence of pituitary autoantibodies was investigated in 34 patients, 25 females and 9 males, with Addison's disease of autoimmune origin and in 10 patients with tuberculous etiology of the disease. In both groups adrenal autoantibodies were also determined. Autoantibodies were determined by radioimmunoassay using solid phase technique in tubes coated with proteins of human adrenal and pituitary microsomal fractions. Pituitary autoantibodies were detected in 28 of 34 patients (20 females and 8 males) with autoimmune Addison's disease but only in 3 patients (2 females and one male) with nonimmune etiology of the disease. Both antipituitary and antiadrenal antibodies remain present in the circulation for many years as they were detected in autoimmune Addison's disease even after 10 or more years after the onset of the disease. There was a close relationship between the occurrence of pituitary antibodies and adrenal autoantibodies: they both appeared in the same patients and high titres of pituitary autoantibodies were associated with high titres of adrenal autoantibodies. This suggests a close similarity or identity of pituitary and adrenal autoantigens.","1503":"Serum activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been measured in 13 women (mean age 43.1 years) with primary hypothyroidism by spectrofluorometric method of Friedland and Silverstein. The mean enzyme activity was significantly lower in hypothyroid patients than in healthy persons. There is no significant correlation between ACE activity and thyroid hormones concentration.","1504":"Solid phase immunoenzymatic methods (ELISA) have been developed for the determination of antithyroglbulin (ATG), antimicrosomal (AMc) and antimembrane (ATMA) antibodies in blood serum. The results have been expressed in international units (IU). The level of nonspecific reaction was determined on the basis of 30 samples of blood serum obtained from healthy donors. The double standard deviation values amounted to 8 IU for antithyroglobulin antibodies, 17 IU for antimicrosomal antibodies and 53 IU for antimembrane antibodies at the serum dilution of 1:100. The values of double standard deviation obtained for the healthy donors correspond to the borderline between the positive serum samples and those containing no autoantibodies. The level of autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune diseases of the thyroid varied considerably ranging from complete absence to several thousand units per milliliter in single cases. Antithyroglobulin antibodies were determined simultaneously by using the described method and the commercial kit (Walker, Cambridge) and the results obtained by the two methods were compared. A linear correlation with the correlation coefficient r = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001 was obtained. A good but nonlinear correlation was demonstrated with the methods expressing the results in titre values.","1505":"The effect of increasing doses of intravenously administered propranolol on electrophysiological features of heart was studied in 17 patients with untreated hyperthyroidism by using the transesophageal stimulation method. A positive and dose-dependent effect of propranolol on the studied parameters was found with the normalization of the majority of disturbances taking place after the administration of 6 mg of propranolol. This dose was safe and well tolerated by the patients. The sensitivity of the auriculo-ventricular junction to propranolol was less pronounced during the stimulated rhythm than during the sinus rhythm.","1506":"The study was aimed at the screening of human chromosomal DNA for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) at the human thyroglobulin (hTg) gene locus. The RFLP screening was performed in a typical way. As hybridization probes were used 5 Pst I fragments of hTg cDNA of the total length 5.1 kb pairs cloned in pBR 322. One not described polymorphism was found by using the probe hTg 10, (nucleotides from position 4830 to 5810 in the 3' flanking region of hTg). Restriction enzyme Msp I identified a single two allele polymorphism: A1: 3.5 kb and A2: 2.5 kb. Of 32 unrelated healthy individuals two were homozygous for 3.5 kb, one was homozygous 2.5 kb and 29 were heterozygous for both 3.5 kb. and 2.5 kb. Thus, the frequencies of the 3.5 and 2.5 kb Msp I alleles were 0.52 and 0.48 respectively.","1507":"The effect of tolbutamide administered in vivo or added to the incubation medium on lipolysis in adipose tissue and in blood has been studied in rats. Tissue lipolysis was lowered by 118 to 156% in groups of rats receiving tolbutamide in vivo. The addition of tolbutamide directly to the incubation medium caused an increase in the lipid mobilizing activity, while the addition of insulin inhibited lipolysis in each case. The effect of tolbutamide administered in vivo may be indirect through an increase in insulin binding and\/or the drug may influence directly the permeability of cell membrane for ions and glucose. An increase in the lipid mobilizing activity observed in experiments consisting in the addition of tolbutamide to the incubation medium may be linked to the low glucose level and greater demand for free fatty acids or to the low level of insulin in the incubation medium.","1508":"Fructosamine concentration (measured by NBT reduction method) and the concentration of glycosylated proteins (measured by a direct UV spectrophotometry upon separation from nonglycosylated proteins by means of affinity chromatography, have been determined simultaneously in 52 samples of blood serum obtained from 42 children with diabetes mellitus and 10 children without metabolic disorders. A highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.96, p &lt; 0.001) was found between the two parameters. It was concluded that fructosamine determination by NBT reduction test reflects the true concentration of glycosylated proteins of blood serum, provided that the proper correction factor derived from the equation of linear regression is used as shown in the following equation: Concentration of glycosylated proteins of blood serum in milligram = 2.78 x (fructosamine concentration in mmol\/l + 1.26).","1509":"","1510":"A direct (without extraction) radioimmunoassay of cortisol in saliva has been developed. The samples of saliva were subjected to four freezing-thawing cycles in order to decrease viscosity which may interfere with the determination. The method is simple, has good specificity and reproducibility. The determination in saliva has also the merit of noninvasiveness, and besides, the level of cortisol in saliva reflects the free, biologically active fraction of the hormone in blood serum. The volume of saliva required does not exceed 25 microliters per tube and the range of concentrations is between 0.6 and 15 nanograms per milliliter (1.5-40 nmol\/l).","1511":"An inexpensive enzyme immunoassay method was designed for the determination of thyroglobulin concentration in human blood serum. The range of concentrations of thyroglobulin which can be measured by the method is between 6 and 800 ng\/ml. The sensitivity of the method is comparable to that of the commercial test kits. The values of thyroglobulin concentration obtained with the use of the described method are strongly correlated (r = 0.946) with those obtained by using the reference method (IRMA kit of Byk, Sweden). The intraassay coefficient of variation ranged from 5.5 to 10.2% and interassay coefficient of variation from 9.5 to 13.2% depending on the thyroglobulin concentration. The upper limit of blood serum thyroglobulin concentration in healthy subjects was 70 ng\/ml. The results of thyroglobulin determination obtained with the described method are falsely lowered in the presence of antithyroglobulin antibodies; simultaneous determination of these antibodies is thus necessary in such a case. It seems that the described method may be used for monitoring the patients after surgical treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer aimed at early detection of metastases.","1512":"Studies concerning metabolism of catecholamines in mice differing with respect to the degree of pigmentation were based on determination of daily excretion of vanillylmandelic and homovanillic acid and tissue content of epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and their methoxy derivatives. It was found that pigmented mice excrete more homovanillic acid, the metabolite of dopamine, than do albinotic mice. Tissue studies have shown that the brain of albinotic mice contains more dopamine and kidneys more epinephrine, norepinephrine and their methoxy derivatives than the respective organs of the pigmented mice. The probable reasons of differences in the rate of inactivation of catecholamines in albinotic and pigmented mice have been discussed.","1513":"Intracellular metabolism of testosterone was studied in in vitro cultured skin fibroblasts obtained from women with idiopathic hirsutism. A significantly higher rate of conversion of testosterone into 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone was found in these women (4.78 +\/- 2.08 fmol\/microgram DNA\/hour) as compared to that obtained for skin cultures of women without symptoms of androgenization (0.98 +\/- 0.37 fmol\/microgram DNA\/hour). These results demonstrate that fibroblast culture may be useful in diagnosing the causes of hyperandrogenization in women with normal androgen secretion.","1514":"The count of peripheral neutrophils having the superficial receptors for Fc IgG fragment (FcR) and C3 component of the complement (CR) was determined in diabetic patients by using the rosette tests EA and EAC according to the modified Buescher method. A significantly lower percentage of neutrophils with FcR and CR receptors was found in patients with both insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes. The lowest values were found in noncompensated diabetes; in compensated diabetes they were higher but still significantly lower than in the controls. The difference was significant in both tests used. The results obtained suggest that the observed fall in the percentage of neutrophils with FcR and CR receptors is caused by metabolic disturbances associated with diabetes.","1515":"Calcitonin concentration (CT) was measured in 52 children with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM). All the patients studied were divided into three groups. The first group consisted of children with freshly diagnosed diabetes remaining in the condition of ketonemic acidosis. The second group was composed of children with the well controlled diabetes during the first two years od duration of the disease. The third group included the patients with poorly controlled diabetes of the duration longer than ten years having the accompanying vascular complications. The control values were determined in children without metabolic disturbances of either diabetic or other origin. CT concentration was significantly elevated both in the patients of the first group and those of the third group. In the second group the concentration of this hormone was close to normal. It is known that calcitonin participates in the homeostasis of calcium and is an important regulator of insulin secretion. The results obtained suggest that calcitonin may play a role both in the pathogenesis of diabetes and in developing of diabetic osteopenia.","1516":"The level of lipoprotein Lp(a), one of the risk factors of atherosclerosis, was determined in 91 children and adolescents of age ranging from 3.3 to 22 years suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes. The changes in Lp(a) were analyzed in relation to the group of patients, the duration of diabetes, possible genetic factors, other factors predisposing to early onset of atherosclerosis, and occurrence of obesity in the analyzed group. The relation between the level of Lp(a) and other parameters of lipid metabolism (total cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B) as well as a degree of metabolic normalization of diabetes (as assessed by the determination of glycosylated hemoglobin and fructosamine) was studied in addition. No relation between Lp(a) and the factors mentioned above, with exception of glycosylated hemoglobin and fructosamine concentrations, could be demonstrated. The elevated level of Lp(a) in children and adolescents during the period of poor metabolic control of diabetes may constitute an additional risk factor for early onset of atherogenic changes.","1517":"The study was aimed at the determination of blood serum levels of the ovarian hormones (estradiol and progesterone) in women during the first menstrual cycle occurring in the course of hospitalization because of the acute viral hepatitis of type B, and in the same women during the first menstrual cycle occurring in the course of early convalescence after leaving the hospital. The observed group consisted of 20 women of age between 18 and 35 years treated because of acute hepatitis without coexisting diseases including gynecological ailments. All the women had a regular 28-day menstrual cycle. Twenty healthy women served as a control group. The blood serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone were determined in all the subjects on 6-th, 12-th, 14-th, 18-th and 22-nd day of the menstrual cycle by RIA method using the ready made reagent kits. A significant decrease in the mean value of estradiol was found in the group of sick women as compared to the control group and to the same group of women in the course of early convalescence. On the other hand the value obtained during the first menstrual cycle after discharge from the hospital did not differ from that observed in healthy women. Mean value of blood serum progesterone concentration was higher in sick women than those in the control group and in the same women during convalescence all the time except on the 22-nd day of the cycle. These values did not differ significantly when comparing the group of sick women during convalescence and the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1518":"The effect of treatment of hypertension with nifedipine on plasma renin activity, blood serum level of aldosterone in the course of renin test, and cortisol and growth hormone concentrations after stimulation with insulin hypoglycemia was followed during two weeks of treatment in 40 patients with essential hypertension. No significant differences in the secretion of the hormones studied, as compared to the patients with the normal arterial blood pressure, were found. After nifedipine treatment no significant changes in the secretion of aldosterone, cortisol and growth hormone were observed despite a significant fall in the arterial blood pressure while there was a moderate stimulatory effect on renin secretion. The results obtained indicate that nifedipine has only small effect on the hormonal system of patients with essential hypertension.","1519":"Blood serum concentrations of thyrotropic hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and cortisol have been measured in 50 patients with duodenal ulcer. The determinations were repeated after a specific time of treatment with ranitidine: in 45 patients after 3 weeks and in 37 after additional 30 days of treatment. During the first period of treatment ranitidine was administered at a dose of 300 mg divided into two daily doses and during the second period of treatment at a single daily dose of 150 mg. A small but statistically significant changes, an increase in T3 and a decrease in TSH concentration, were observed before the treatment. No changes concerning these two parameters were found as an effect of the treatment. A decrease in the concentration of T4 was found, on the other hand, after three weeks of ranitidine administration. This decrease persisted after further 30 days of chronic treatment with ranitidine. No significant changes concerning blood serum cortisol concentration were found in any of the studied groups.","1520":"Intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 as measured by the Schillin test was studied in 50 patients with primary hypothyroidism of autoimmune origin. The impaired absorption of vitamin B12 was found in 24% of the patients studied, and in 6% a clinically evident form of pernicious anemia was diagnosed. The patients with hypothyroidism and simultaneous defect in absorption of vitamin B12 were characterized by more frequent occurrence of the high titer of antithyroid microsomal antibodies, higher blood serum concentration of TSH and lower blood content of hemoglobin as compared with hypothyroid patients having normal intestinal absorption of vitamin B12.","1521":"The evaluation of the migration inhibition test with thyroid membrane antigen was carried out in 20 patients with Graves' disease, 13 patients with neutral nodular goiter and 13 healthy subjects. A significant inhibition of migration by thyroid antigen as compared to the control group was demonstrated only in the patients with Graves' disease (the value of the migration index was 0.57 +\/- 0.07). The respective value was 0.79 +\/- 0.16 in patients with nodular goiter and 0.85 +\/- 0.11 in healthy subjects. The results obtained indicate the practical value of the migration inhibition test in diagnosing the thyroid diseases having an autoimmune background.","1522":"Thyroid function was investigated in a group of 61 newborns with congenital goiter before starting the therapy with thyroid hormones. The group included 19 girls and 42 boys, of which 27 were of age not exceeding one week (group I), 19 were between the first and the second week (group II), and 15 were between the second week and the third month of life (group III). The concentrations of the thyroid hormones were determined by radioimmunoassay. The values obtained have been compared with the local reference range obtained for the newborns of the Mazovia region. The values remaining outside the reference range were found in 47.5% of the newborns studied. The elevated values of TSH were observed mainly in group I newborns (12 from 27); among group II newborns there was only one with the elevated values, and none among the newborns of group III. thyroxine (T4) values were lowered in 14 among 27 newborns of group I, and in 2 among 19 newborns of group II; all T4 values were normal in group III. The percentage of the elevated values of triiodothyronine (T3) was higher in older newborns (group III). The elevated level of T3 accompanied by the lowered level of T4 with the normal or moderately elevated level of TSH is characteristic for the adaptation to the deficiency of iodine. There is preferential secretion of T3 aimed at maintaining euthyreosis. The elevated levels of T3 found in 30% of newborns with untreated goiter suggest an intrauterine deficit of iodine as a cause of the goiter appearance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1523":"Early results of combined use of glucocorticoid administration and irradiation with radioactive cobalt for treatment of oedematous-infiltrative ophthalmopathy associated with Graves' disease have been analyzed in a group of 33 patients including 28 women and 5 men of age between 25 and 66 years (mean age 47.3 years). The combined therapy was a modification of the original method of Bartalena et al. which consisted in the gradual increase of the initial dose of glucocorticoids and prolongation of the period of administration of the drug. The ophthalmic lesions were assessed by thorough ophthalmologic examination and classified according to Werner. The ophthalmopathy index was calculated according to Donaldson. Satisfactory results of treatment have been obtained in 32 patients, with 9 patients being completely relieved from any objective or subjective ophthalmic symptoms (very good results), and 23 patients having still small afflictions originating from the soft tissues of the eye socket, exophthalmos, diplopia during marginal vision and a decreased visual acuity (good results). The clinical recovery was mostly connected with the improvement in the condition of soft tissues of the eye socket, cornea and external ocular muscles and, to a smaller extent, exophthalmos which persisted to some degree and acuity of vision not always attaining normal values. In one person the results of treatment were unsatisfactory despite some improvement. Very good and good results obtained in 97% of patients indicate that the administration of glucocorticoids combined with the irradiation of retrobulbar tissues with radioactive cobalt can now be regarded as the most effective method of treatment of the progressive oedematous-infiltrative ophthalmopathy.","1524":"","1525":"MOST IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS: (FROM COUNTRY-WIDE POPULATION STUDIES) 1. In some voivodships localized in south-east and north-east parts of Poland thyroids of young children would, without protective measures, accumulate more then 60 MsV of radioiodine, thus exceeding intervention level settled for the country. 2. Thyroid function of newborns exposed to radioiodine during neonatal life was normal and frequency of neonatal hypothyroidism similar to that seen in years before Czernobyl accident. 3. Potassium iodide administrated to newborns in some of them profuced transient rise of TSH (Wolff-Chaikoff phenomenon), thus suggesting, that ki dose settled for newborns could be to high. 4. Thyroid radioiodine dose accumulated in thyroids of older children, teenagers and adults was in majority of regions well below the dose of 50 MsV. 5. The frequency of non-toxic diffuse goiter, especially in traditional endemic goiter area was found to be high, but is also relatively high in others regions of Poland and seems to depend on iodine deficiency or relative iodine deficiency. 6. The frequency of other thyroid disorders is within the limit reported in countries with relative iodine deficiency. 7. More than 95% of children and teenagers took protective, single dose of potassium iodide (about 10 millions). 8. Approximately 27% of adults took protective dose of potassium iodide (about 7 millions). 9. Organization of protective action in 11 north-east and south-east voivodoships was good about 75% of all obtain ki solution within 24 hours. In the rest of the country where protective action was ordered april 30, in afternoon hrs only about 25% obtained ki the same day and the rest during next 48-72 hrs. 10. The fact that prior to the protective action limited number of children was given iodine alcohol solution permitted for external use speaks about the fear and panic observed in Poland in first days after Czernobyl accident. 11. Extrathyroidal side-effects after ki administration appeared in about 5% were usually light or moderate and in majority of cases disappearing without medical assistance. Vomiting was most commonly seen side-effect in young children, thus suggesting that either dose, or the chemical form of the drug for this group of age was unproper. 12. Intrathyroidal side-effects of single dose of ki was rare phenomenon seen mostly in newborns, very young children and some adults with history of thyroid disease in the past. 13. Its possible that even small dose of radioiodine accumulated in thyroid produce immunological response leading to the appearance of thyroid antibodies in blood serum.","1526":"In 1986-1990 epidemiologic studies on the thyroid diseases frequency in the polish population were undertaken.

The most common preparation was Lugol solution given in a single dose. Among all persons who received iodine, only in 5% of subjects the side effects were noted (mostly in children), including symptoms of gastrointestinal tract (vomiting, abdomen pain) and occasionally intrathyroid side effects (thyroid pains). In examined population the high frequency of thyroid enlargement, mainly in women (up to 43-44% at the age group 30-50 years) was found. The frequency of clinical diagnosis of thyroid disease was higher in women than in man (most often the diffuse goiter, rarely the nodular goiter).

So as to control the present state of general health and thyroid state in the study group a questionnaire with a letter to parents explaining the aim of the inquiry was sent to the parents (see addenda). About 14000 letters were send from which around 12000 responses were returned to the Institute. From informations received this way we draw the preliminary conclusion that no significant damage in health of these children or their siblings can be found. About 20% of the mothers admitted taking the Lugol solution in a last day of pregnancy. However it should be taken into account that these data were collected 2 years after the accident and are not fully reliable. In the period 1989-1990 a group of 1912 children (938 boys and 974 girls) was called to the Department of Endocrinology of the Institute and inspected. The age was from 2.9 to 4.2 years.

The measured values of 131I concentration in air and in milk and standard values for milk and food consumption and inhalation rate as well as metabolic parameters were used. Theoretical calculations showed that administering of stable iodine on 1986-04-28, 1986-04-29, 1986-04-30 and 1986-05-01 could have reduced committed dose equivalent H50 form ingestion with inhalation pathway by about 44%, 40%, 26%, 12% respectively. On the basis of measured 131I activity in the thyroid for inhabitants from different districts in Poland (1400 measurement) committed dose equivalents were determined and analysis of radiation hazard from 131I were performed. In the most contaminated regions of Poland average H50 doses for children 1-5 and 5-10 years old are close to 50 mSv (permissible level for population) and maximal doses exceed this limit four times.

The following features were found in the patients with hyperthyroidism: 1. the elevated values of the index of spontaneous NBT reduction which return to normal following the treatment with propranolol or metizol lasting 14 days, 2. a decrease in the phagocyting activity of neutrophils occurring with stimulation of phagocytosis by both the latex particles and bacteria cells. 3. the return to normal values of the index of neutrophils phagocyting the latex particles following two-week treatment with propranolol or metizol. It was concluded that in patients with hyperthyroidism the changes in NRT reduction and phagocyting activity of peripheral blood neutrophils return to normal following the two-week treatment of these patients with both propranolol and metizol.","1545":"Scintigraphic and gammagraphic (gamma-camera) techniques have been applied in diagnosing \"hot\" non-TSH dependent thyroid nodules. On the basis of frequent uneven accumulation of isotopic tracer observed in scintigraphic studies it was concluded that the structure of these nodules is heterogeneous. In some cases paradoxical patterns have been obtained following the dynamic tests of suppression and stimulation of the thyroid: after the administration of thyroid preparations paranodular thyroid tissue appears, while TSH administration causes an increase in the iodine uptake by the nodule. Ultrasonographic and gamma-camera studies have been carried out in 50 cases of \"hot\" autonomic thyroid nodules previously diagnosed by scintigraphy. Ultrasonographic studies revealed a weaker echogenicity in some cases and an intensified echo in the other. Sometimes by using this technique it was possible to demonstrate the occurrence of heterogeneous structures suggesting a cystic degeneration of the nodule. Paranodular thyroid tissue, invisible in scintigraphic scanning, could usually be observed by applying gamma-camera. It was concluded that both gamma camera and ultrasonographic studies confirm heterogeneous structure of intranodular tissue producing paradoxical patterns in scintigraphic scanning, with the latter technique usually aiding the detection of paranodular thyroid tissue without the necessity of application of the TSH test.","1546":"","1547":"","1548":"The study was aimed at investigating the changes in the blood serum concentrations of growth hormone (HGH), insulin and placental lactogen (HPL) in the newborns of diabetic mothers as compared to those born from physiological pregnancies.

The mean insulin concentration was significantly higher, and that of HGH significantly lower in the newborns of diabetic mothers, as compared to those of healthy mothers. It seems that the occurrence of fetal macrosomy in diabetic pregnancies is associated with high insulin levels.","1549":"The influence of bilateral gonadectomy on the secretory segments of the partoid gland in male rats was investigated. The changes in the section area of cell nuclei, secretory cells, serous vesicles as well as in the mean number of cells in the vesicles were statistically analyzed. Eleven-day gonadectomy caused a statistically significant increase of the mean section area of cell nuclei, secretory vesicles and cells. Eight-day mesterone treatment in the dose of 2 mg\/kg of body mass does not eliminate the changes caused by gonadectomy but results in the further increase of the mean section area of cell nuclei and secretory vesicles, as well as in the increase of cells in the vesicles.","1550":"","1551":"The changes in blood serum concentrations of calcium, magnesium, inorganic phosphate, total activity of alkaline phosphatase and the activity of its bone fraction, as well as urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, hydroxyproline and oxalate have been measured in 31 patients with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes, in 31 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes and in 29 healthy subjects in the condition of low-calcium diet. The elevated urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, hydroxyproline and oxalate, lowered blood serum level of magnesium, and increased total and bone fraction activities of alkaline phosphatase were found in diabetic patients. The urinary excretion of calcium and hydroxyproline, and the activity of bone fraction alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with type II diabetes than in those with type I diabetes.

It was demonstrated that the microsomal membrane preparations originating from the thyroid tissue obtained following operation of goiter in Graves' disease are characterized by several times bigger content of microsomal antigen than those obtained after operation of nontoxic goiter. A sensitive ELISA method has been devised for the determination of microsomal autoantibodies in blood serum. The results obtained by this methods were found to be well correlated (r = 0.67) with those obtained with RIA kits manufactured by Serono. The level of antibodies in blood serum was determined in patients with thyroid disorders and the results were compared with those obtained in a group of patients with autoimmune diseases not associated with the thyroid and in healthy blood donors. The occurrence of antimicrosomal autoantibodies was demonstrated in 90.3% of patients with untreated Grave's disease, in 89% of patients with Hashimoto disease, and in 17.7% of patients with toxic goiter.

The levels of calcemia and calciuria (2.56 +\/- 0.015 mmol\/l and 4.70 +\/- 0.41 mmol\/10 mmoles of creatinine, respectively) were found to be significantly higher in patients with active urolithiasis than in healthy subjects. In addition, in patients with urolithiasis the basal blood serum concentrations of thyroxine and aldosterone were significantly higher than in healthy subjects, while the reactivity of cortisol and aldosterone secretion to synacten stimulation was normal.

Blood serum concentrations of triglycerides, free fatty acids and glucose, as well as lipolytic activity against exogenous substrate, were determined in addition. Estradiol administration was found to enhance the activity of factors potentiating lipolysis both in the blood and in adipose tissue of female rats, inasmuch as an increase in free fatty acids and triglyceride concentration, and a decrease in glucose concentration were observed during the period of administration of the hormone.","1575":"The effectiveness of therapy involving intravenous administration of methimazole applied in patients with hyperthyroidism resistant to oral thyrostatic drugs has been investigated. Methimazole (Favistan, Asta) was administered intravenously to 3 patients (two women and one man, of ages 21, 24 and 67 years, respectively) in whom there was no remission of the disease after oral methimazole therapy lasting at least two months. Blood serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse++ triiodothyronine (rT3) and triiodothyronine binding index (T3I) have been measured and free thyroxine index (FT4I) calculated before the treatment and on the 4-th, 7-th, 11-th, 14-th and 17-th day of the treatment. The mean value of T4 concentration decreased from 17.0 micrograms\/dl before the treatment to 9.7 micrograms\/dl after the treatment.

In basal conditions the concentration of alpha subunit in patients with the alphoma-type tumors ranged between 2.1 and 30 micrograms\/l (mean 7.5 +\/- 6.6 micrograms\/l), and in controls the respective values ranged between 0.2 and 1.6 micrograms\/l (mean 0.78 +\/- 0.36 micrograms\/l). In the course of the LH-RH + TRH test there was an increase in the alpha subunit level both in the patients with alphoma associated with acromegaly and in the remaining cases of alphoma. Statistical analysis of the results obtained for the whole group of patients revealed a significant linear correlation between the alpha unit concentration 20, 30, 60 and 90 minutes following stimulation with the neurohormones and that before stimulation. For 9 patients with the acromegaly-associated tumors a statistically significant increase in the alpha subunit concentration was noted only at the 90-th minute of the stimulation test, while for the remaining 12 patients with alphoma an increase was statistically significant for the whole time of the duration of the test. In healthy subjects the concentration of alpha subunit never exceeded the limits of the normal values in the course of the LH-RH + TRH stimulation test.","1582":"","1583":null,"1584":"A group of 153 patients with scintigraphically detected autonomic \"hot\" nodules of the thyroid has been subjected to clinical and histopathological analysis. Substantial part of these patients (30.1%) had hyperthyroidism, partly (in 19.9% of cases) in the form of the thyrocardiac syndrome. A most frequent histopathological lesion found within \"hot\" nodules was follicular adenoma. The occurrence of malignancy in the form of highly differentiated thyroid carcinoma was observed in 2.6% of cases. The incidence of thyroid carcinoma within \"hot\" nodules was in our material only two and half times smaller than in a previously analyzed group of patients with \"cold\" nodules of the thyroid.","1585":"Among the patients directed to the Department of Endocrinology of the Institute of Internal Medicine for diagnostic examinations of the thyroid, 726 (647 women and 79 men, of age between 16 and 79 years) were qualified to surgery after scintigraphic detection of cold nodules. From this group, 474 patients had thin-needle biopsy specimens taken for cytologic examination. The results of the latter examinations have been compared with those of histologic examination performed on the tissue removed during surgery. The occurrence of a malignant tumor (in 99.1%--thyroid cancer) was found in 108 patients (22.8%) from the group having thin-needle biopsy performed. Comparison of the results of cytologic examination with those of postoperative histologic examination demonstrated low sensitivity of biopsy examination (50.0%), as opposed to high specificity (96.2%) and high accuracy (85, 3%). Analysis of the false-negative results (54\/108) revealed that the main causes of errors are difficulties in differentiation of adenoma from follicular carcinoma. Widening of the indications to surgery by a group of patients with adenoma will increase sensitivity to 84.8% and will require including into the operated group of about 50% of patients with scintigraphically diagnosed cold nodules: The introduction of the new term: \"urgent strumectomy\", has been proposed; also a diagnostic algorithm, useful for early diagnosis of malignant tumors of the thyroid, has been discussed.","1586":"","1587":"","1588":"","1589":"","1590":"","1591":"","1592":"","1593":"","1594":"","1595":"","1596":"","1597":"","1598":"","1599":"","1600":"","1601":"","1602":"","1603":"","1604":"","1605":"","1606":"","1607":"The studies aimed at evaluation of pituitary reserve of growth hormone following stimulation with GRF have been carried out in a group of 33 patients (11 women and 22 men, of age between 25 and 62 years) with pituitary tumors. The studied material included cases with pituitary adenoma characterized by excessive secretion of growth hormone (somatotropinoma), prolactin (prolactinoma) or alpha subunits of glycoprotein hormones (alphoma), and those with hormonally inactive adenoma. The GRF stimulation tests were carried out in hospitalized patients after overnight fast between 8.00 and 10.00 a.m. Blood samples for hormonal determinations were taken before the test, and after 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following intravenous administration of 100 micrograms of GRF 1-29. Besides growth hormone, also the blood serum concentrations of other pituitary hormones were determined in the patients studied, both in the basal state and during the dynamic tests. In patients with acromegaly the results of the determinations of growth hormone following stimulation with GRF showed considerable individual variability. In 5 cases there was an increase in blood serum growth hormone concentration. No response to GRF was noted in the remaining 8 cases. In adenoma cases of prolactinoma type, growth hormone concentration began to rise already at the 15-th minute of the test in most cases. In three cases of prolactinoma associated with acromegaly no response to GRF was observed. The cases of alphoma-type adenoma were usually characterized by the secretion of pituitary hormones other than growth hormone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1608":"","1609":"","1610":"","1611":"","1612":"","1613":"","1614":"","1615":"","1616":"","1617":"","1618":"The study was aimed at evaluation of the effect of short-term treatment with one of the six beta adrenolytic drugs (propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol, pindolol, nadolol, acebutolol) and calcium antagonist nifedipine on the values of several parameters of calcium-phosphorus metabolism in 81 patients with hyperthyroidism (14 patients with Graves' disease, and 67 patients with toxic nodular goiter), and 82 patients with simple goiter.

It appears that accessory sexual glands were mainly responsible for the observed abnormalities. Since testicular position and size, serum testosterone and FSH levels were normal it seems that hypospadias and the accompanied disturbances are connected with reduction of responsiveness of target tissues to androgen stimuli rather, than with lesion of the testicle. The coexistence of normal serum testosterone and elevation of serum LH suggests the decrease of sensitivity of hypothalamic or pituitary receptors to negative feedback influence of androgens. The consciousness of sexual inadequacy noted in some cases was mainly of emotional character.","2001":"There were analysed 61 cases of Turner's syndrome, in this group--48 cases with 45,X karyotype.

These children were divided into two groups, the first one included 11 children with frequent angina and the second group consisted of 9 children with serious difficulties in breathing, but without angina. In these groups serum cortisol levels were estimated before and 3-4 months post tonsilectomy or adenotomy. 11 healthy children of the similar age were included into a control group. It was found that in the first group (hypertrophy and frequent angina) initial resting and ACTH stimulated cortisol levels were statistically significantly higher than in the control group. In the same group 3-4 months post surgery serum cortisol levels were lower and similar to those found in control group. On the contrary, in children of the second group (hypertrophy without angina) the resting and ACTH stimulated serum cortisol levels were lower than in control group and these levels did not change 3-4 months after surgery.","2003":"In 50 children with obesitas simplex, 6-14 years of age, the triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids (FFA) and cortisol (F) levels in venous blood serum were estimated. In agreement with the development stages, studied patients were divided into the group of younger children in prematurity stage and the group of older children approaching the maturity. Obtained mean values of TG, FFA and F concentrations were analysed in the particular groups of obese children and compared with the healthy children of the same age. Mean concentrations of TG, FFA and cortisol in obese children were within the normal values and statistically did not differ from those of control healthy children. Also there was no difference in parameters studied if compared the younger and older groups of obese children. There was no interrelationship between the high birth weight and the degree of overweight as well as between the duration of obesity and the blood serum TG levels. In the course of obesitas simplex in children no detectable disturbances in the levels of TG, FFA and cortisol were found. It may depends on the more efficient adaptational mechanism connected with metabolism which are acting in the course of overfeed in the period of growth and development.","2004":"The physiological mean concentrations of T3, T4 an TSH in 150 healthy children aged from 1 month to 2 years of life decreased gradually with age.

The results showed that in children suffering from diabetes, excretion of adrenaline was increased and that of noradrenaline decreased when compared with healthy children. Taking into consideration changes in the sympatho-adrenergic system activity in cases with different degrees of compensation of metabolic processes during insulinization, it should be stressed that in children with ketoacidosis, excretion of catecholamines was still different in comparison with control group. On the other hand in children with compensate diabetes after insulin therapy, that differences were little. Marked increase in free adrenaline excretion observed in children with ketoacidosis and its normalization by effective insulinization seems to support the diabetogenic and ketogenic role of this neurohormone. Decrease in free noradrenaline excretion in children suffering from juvenile diabetes appears to suggest that there is a diminished sensitivity of the sympathetic system resulting probably from specific autonomic neuropathy accompanying this disease.","2007":"","2008":"","2009":"In 22 patients with restricted growth the consecutive stimulation with arginine and insuline was applied for the diagnosis of somatotropic insufficiency. 13 children showed GH insufficiency.

Secretions taken from different parts of the genital tract did not show any significant differences in stimulatory action.","2225":"","2226":"","2227":"","2228":"","2229":"","2230":"","2231":"","2232":"","2233":"","2234":"","2235":"","2236":"","2237":"","2238":"","2239":"","2240":"","2241":"","2242":"","2243":"","2244":"","2245":"","2246":"","2247":"","2248":"","2249":"","2250":"","2251":"","2252":"","2253":"","2254":"","2255":"","2256":"","2257":"","2258":"","2259":"","2260":"","2261":"","2262":"","2263":"","2264":"","2265":"","2266":"","2267":"","2268":"","2269":"","2270":"","2271":"","2272":"","2273":"","2274":"","2275":"","2276":"","2277":"","2278":"","2279":"","2280":"","2281":"","2282":"","2283":"","2284":"","2285":"","2286":"","2287":"","2288":"","2289":"","2290":"","2291":"","2292":"","2293":"","2294":"","2295":"","2296":"","2297":"","2298":"","2299":"","2300":"","2301":"","2302":"","2303":"","2304":"","2305":"","2306":"","2307":"","2308":"","2309":"","2310":"","2311":"","2312":"","2313":"","2314":"","2315":"","2316":"","2317":"","2318":"","2319":"","2320":"","2321":"","2322":"","2323":"","2324":"","2325":"","2326":"","2327":"","2328":"","2329":"","2330":"","2331":"","2332":"","2333":"","2334":"","2335":"","2336":"","2337":"","2338":"","2339":"","2340":"","2341":"","2342":"","2343":"","2344":"","2345":"","2346":"","2347":"","2348":"","2349":"","2350":"","2351":"","2352":"","2353":"","2354":"","2355":"","2356":"","2357":"","2358":"","2359":"","2360":"","2361":"","2362":"","2363":"","2364":"","2365":"","2366":"","2367":"","2368":"","2369":"","2370":"","2371":"","2372":"","2373":"","2374":"","2375":"","2376":"","2377":"","2378":"","2379":"","2380":"","2381":"","2382":"","2383":"","2384":"","2385":"","2386":"","2387":"","2388":"","2389":"","2390":"","2391":"","2392":"","2393":"","2394":"","2395":"","2396":"","2397":"","2398":"","2399":"","2400":"","2401":"","2402":"","2403":"","2404":"","2405":"","2406":"","2407":"","2408":"","2409":"","2410":"","2411":"","2412":"","2413":"","2414":"","2415":"","2416":"","2417":"","2418":"","2419":"","2420":"","2421":"","2422":"","2423":"","2424":"","2425":"","2426":"","2427":"","2428":"","2429":"","2430":"","2431":"","2432":"","2433":"","2434":"","2435":"","2436":"","2437":"","2438":"","2439":"","2440":"","2441":"","2442":"","2443":"","2444":"","2445":"","2446":"","2447":"","2448":"","2449":"","2450":"","2451":"","2452":"","2453":"","2454":"","2455":"","2456":"","2457":"","2458":"","2459":"","2460":"","2461":"","2462":"","2463":"","2464":"","2465":"","2466":"","2467":"","2468":"","2469":"","2470":"","2471":"","2472":"","2473":"","2474":"","2475":"","2476":"","2477":"","2478":"","2479":"","2480":"","2481":"","2482":"","2483":"","2484":"","2485":"","2486":"","2487":"","2488":"","2489":"","2490":"","2491":"","2492":"","2493":"","2494":"","2495":"","2496":"","2497":"","2498":"","2499":"","2500":"","2501":"","2502":"","2503":"","2504":"","2505":"","2506":"","2507":"","2508":"","2509":"","2510":"","2511":"","2512":"","2513":"","2514":"","2515":"","2516":"","2517":"","2518":"","2519":"","2520":"","2521":"","2522":"","2523":"","2524":"","2525":"","2526":"","2527":"","2528":"","2529":"","2530":"","2531":"","2532":"","2533":"","2534":"","2535":"","2536":"","2537":"","2538":"","2539":"","2540":"","2541":"","2542":"","2543":"","2544":"","2545":"","2546":"","2547":"","2548":"","2549":"","2550":"","2551":"","2552":"","2553":"","2554":"","2555":"","2556":"","2557":"","2558":"","2559":"","2560":"","2561":"","2562":"","2563":"","2564":"","2565":"","2566":"","2567":"","2568":"","2569":"28 women were treated with .1 mg of mestranol + 3 mg of chlormadinone and 25 were treated with .1 mg of mestranol + 1 mg of ethynodiol diacetate.
