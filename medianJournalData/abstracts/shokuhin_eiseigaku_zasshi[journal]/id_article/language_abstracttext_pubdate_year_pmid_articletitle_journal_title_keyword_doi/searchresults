rapid, easy and versatile, simultaneous analytical method based on three-layer extraction was developed for the determination of 6 fungicides in lemon. In this method, degreasing with n-hexane, partitioning into acetonitrile, and purification by the salting-out effect were simultaneously performed after extraction with acetone. It allowed to prepare a test solution without concentrating, transferring, and purification using solid phase extraction column.As a result, 6 fungicides in lemon met the management criteria of the guideline for validity assessment (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan). Thus, the present method could be useful for a rapid determination of fungicides in lemon.","1":"As an analytical method for aflatoxins in foods, the analytical method based on the notification by the director of the Food Safety Department, Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (August 16, 2011) has been established. In order to improve the operability and analytical performance of the conventional method, this study aimed to construct an improved method that optimized selection of immunoaffinity column (IAC) and purifying condition, and omitted evaporation after the purification with IAC. In the recovery test performed by adding 2.5 ng\/g of aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2 standard solutions into 9 kinds of food samples, the improved method achieved the established target values: 77.0-99.7% of recovery, 1.7-5.6% of intra-assay coefficient of validation, and 0.9-3.6% of inter-assay of coefficient of variation, respectively. The improved method also achieved 4.3-10.5% greater recovery and 1.5 hours shorter preparation time than the conventional one. These results indicate applicability of the improved method for 9 kinds of foods and its efficacy as an analytical method for aflatoxins in foods.","2":"Assessment of carcinogenicity is important for human health at dietary risk assessment of pesticide residues. This article indicated important points on interpretation of carcinogenicity in toxicological evaluation of pesticide residues based on principles of risk analysis in foods by CODEX to be a guide for risk assessors. This guidance was referred from the guidance on carcinogenicity evaluation by international and\/or national organizations, and the interpretations of Food Safety Commissions of Japan (FSCJ) published in their risk assessment reports. We focused on carcinogenicity obtained from routine carcinogenicity bioassays in rodents. The guidance includes the purpose and usefulness of the bioassay studies, consideration points to be carcinogenicity and influencing factors to carcinogenicity in the test to judge carcinogenic hazard at hazard identification. Considering on human relevance as carcinogenic hazard also was proposed using practical case examples. Next, a carcinogenic hazard is evaluated on dose-response relationship to judge points of departure on carcinogenicity. At the end of this article, we challenged our recommendation on future assessment of carcinogenicity to progress from hazard to risk.","3":"The prevalence of health food use is increasing not only among healthy individuals but also among patients. Many patients consume drugs and health foods concomitantly, and most of them use more than one drug and one health food. In this regard, the interactions between drugs and health foods should be addressed. However, it is not clear where healthcare professionals can get sufficient information about the interactions between drugs and health foods. To address this issue, we conducted an online questionnaire about the consultation and attitude concerning and information source of interactions between drugs and health foods among pharmacists and dietitians. Only 29.7% of pharmacists and 14.0% of dietitians always confirmed the use of health foods among their patients, even though they work at pharmacies or hospitals. Regarding concomitant use, 79.2% of pharmacists and 60.2% of dietitians allowed their patients to continue concomitant use, and less than 20% of them advised their patients to avoid concomitant use. Most of them checked the manufacturer's website and could not obtain sufficient information about the interactions between drugs and health foods. However, they utilized the \"Information system on safety and effectiveness for health foods (HFNet),\" which is the website of the National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, to obtain information, if they were aware of this. In conclusion, pharmacists and dietitians need more information about the interactions between drugs and health foods, and HFNet may play an important role as information source.","4":"From 2012 to 2017, many adverse events, such as irregular vaginal bleeding and menstrual disorders, associated with the use of health foods containing Pueraria mirifica were reported in PIO-NET. Health foods containing P. mirifica claim mastogenic or body shaping effects, and it is for this reason that many women use these products. As a result, the Japanese government investigated and assessed the possibility of the occurrence of adverse effects associated with the use of other ingredients in health foods and labelled P. mirifica, Coleus forskohlii, black cohosh, and greater celandine as \"designated ingredient, etc.\"The present study showed that recognition of \"designated ingredient, etc.\" was 45.9% and that there was a difference between consumers and healthcare professionals. The prevalence of food containing P. mirifica use was 1.2%. Almost half of users experienced adverse events, such as irregular vaginal bleeding and menstrual disorder. Some subjects had a good perception towards \"designated ingredient, etc.,\" such as \"It seems effective\"(32.7%) and \"It seems good for health\"(18.9%).

To avoid adverse events associated with \"food containing designated ingredient, etc.,\" detailed information should be provided.","5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":"We examined the effects of cooking and processing on the quantitation of soy protein in various soy-based foods. For the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) extraction, the total protein content was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay, and the buffer extraction containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 2-mercaptoethanol (ME) was measured by the 2-D Quant Kit, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (SDS-PAGE) of each extraction was performed. Furthermore, measurements were performed by various ELISAs. During the tofu cooking process, the protein concentrations of soaked soybeans and Seigo (soybean homogenized with water) fluctuated- the change in protein solubility due to the amount of water during sample homogenization was considered to be a factor. It was thought that the decrease in protein concentration due to heating of Seigo during soymilk production was considered to indicate thermal denaturation of the protein, and that SDS and ME extraction in tofu may affect the measurement system. In cooking excluding roasted beans, proteins with a mass of 50 kDa or above and around 20 kDa were denatured, and in twice-fried tofu, proteins around 40 kDa were denatured, but the protein concentration excluding boiled soybeans did not decreased. Furthermore, the protein concentration from roasted beans, yuba, roasted okara and fried tofu increased with the cooking time, suggesting that the denaturation temperature of the protein shifted to a high temperature as the water content decreased. Both of the two types of ELISAs that comply with the official labeling system of foods containing allergenic substances were useful for detecting soybean protein by detecting proteins and peptides in processed soybean products, fermented foods excluding natto, and health foods.","9":"To promote and raise the awareness of accurate knowledge on pesticide residues, the symposium program on risk communication on pesticide residues was held by the broadcasted online style. The risk communication program was statistically evaluated using a pre- and post-program online questionnaire survey. We had the questionnaire answers of the 105 valid participants. The analysis of post-program questionnaires shows that the risk communication program was effective in terms of levels of understanding and interest. Pre-program risk perception or awareness of safety assessments was significantly and positively correlated with awareness for establishing standard values of pesticide residues by the analysis of pre-program questionnaires. Risk perception after the program was significantly higher than before the program, suggesting that risk perception increased due to the program by analysis the same question between pre- and post-program questionnaires. Multiple regression analysis suggests that the participants with higher pre-program awareness of safety assessments or pre-program awareness for establishing standard values appeared to have higher levels of understanding and post-program risk perception.","10":null,"11":"Food can sometimes contain odors not normally associated with that food. These odors are called off-flavors, and cow milk is known to contain off-flavors such as hexanal depending on the feed or physical condition of the cows. We previously discovered and revealed the structure of 2-Iodo-4-methylphenol (2I4MP), an off-flavor component in commercially available cow milk. We were the first group to discover 2I4MP is an off-flavor component in cow milk.This study investigated the following three questions. First, what compounds serve as the starting materials in generating 2I4MP? Organic synthesis techniques were used to identify p-cresol as a candidate starting material. Second, how is 2I4MP generated in the cowshed? Using cow dung, we confirmed that 2I4MP was generated by the effects of iodine on cow dung. Based on these findings, measures were proposed to prevent contamination of cow milk by 2I4MP. Third, how is 2I4MP transferred to raw milk? 2I4MP movement was estimated by creating a desiccator-based model that showed 2I4MP is potentially transferred to raw milk in the cowshed. These involve that the iodine-based disinfectants, used to disinfect teats during milking, should not be used excessively. Furthermore, ensuring the disinfectants do not fall onto cow dung or bedding. Adopting these measures is vital for preventing contamination of cow milk by 2I4MP.","12":"In this study, we developed an analytical method for simultaneous determination of 14 quinolones and 4 tetracyclines in livestock and fishery products using LC-MS\/MS. The analytes were extracted from food samples with citrate buffer (containing EDTA)-methanol-acetonitrile (3 : 1 : 1, v\/v\/v) in the presence of n-hexane, and the extract was purified with an Oasis PRiME HLB cartridge column. It was suggested that this analytical method can also extract analytes from solid samples containing fat by using n-hexane. In addition, using methanol-acetonitrile (3 : 7, v\/v) containing 0.1 vol% formic acid as an eluent from the cartridge column, the purification effect could be improved, while minimizing the impairment of the recovery rate. As a result of the validation using six types of food samples, trueness (accuracy) was 70.6%-113.8%, the RSD of repeatability was 9.0% or less, and the RSD of within-laboratory reproducibility was 15.5% or less. Using this approach, the standard values mentioned in the Japanese guideline were successfully met.","13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":"Aflatoxins (AFs) are known to be oncogenic mycotoxins. This study investigated the mitigation effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from four types of vegetable, cucumber, Chinese cabbage, Japanese radish and eggplant, which are used to make Japanese traditional fermented pickles, on AFs. Using aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) binding assay for screening, four representative strains were selected (one from each vegetable) from total 94 LAB strains, based on the highest binding ratio. The ranges of the binding ratio of these representative strains to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), aflatoxin B2, aflatoxin G1, aflatoxin G2 and AFM1 were 57.5%-87.9% for the LAB strain derived from cucumber, 18.9%-43.9% for the LAB strain derived from Chinese cabbage, 26.4%-41.7% for the LAB strain derived from Japanese radish, and 15.0%-42.6% for the LAB strain derived from eggplant. The strains isolated from cucumber, Chinese cabbage, Japanese radish and eggplant were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Weissella cibaria, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leu. mesenteroides, respectively. An in vitro binding assay of the four strains under acidic conditions showed that the number of living bacteria decreased, while the binding ratio increased in some strains, suggesting that the LAB maintained their capacity to bind aflatoxins even in an environment that imitated the stomach. An in vivo experiment using L. lactis subsp. lactis derived from cucumber revealed that the bacteria significantly inhibited the absorption of AFB1 into blood. These results showed that the LAB used for Japanese vegetable pickles was an effective binding agent of AFs and suggested that they might play a role in mitigating AF absorption.","17":"We have developed a quantitative determination method of the concentration of inorganic arsenic in pet foods using a liquid chromatograph-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (LC-ICP-MS). After adding 2 w\/v% TMAH solution to a sample, inorganic arsenic was extracted by heating and the extract was collected by water. The pH of the solution was adjusted, and injected into a LC-ICP-MS to determine the concentration of inorganic arsenic. LC separation was carried out on an ODS column with 10 mmol\/L sodium 1-butanesulfonate, 4 mmol\/L malonic acid, 4 mmol\/L TMAH and 0.05% methanol solution as a mobile phase. A collaborative study was conducted by nine laboratories using dry and wet-type pet foods, formed jerky, dried jerky and biscuit. Dry-type pet food and dried jerky was added with 2 mg\/kg of As (III). Wet-type pet food was added with 0.5 mg\/kg of As (III). Formed jerky was added with 1 mg\/kg of As (III). Biscuit was added with 0.2 mg\/kg of As (III).

As a result, 202 analytes met the management criteria of the guideline for validity assessment (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan). Thus, the present method could be useful for a rapid simultaneous determination of residual pesticides in green soybean.","19":"The sensitivity of the 3M TM Molecular Detection Assay 2-STEC Gene Screen (stx) assay (3M MDA2 STEC assay) was evaluated for verotoxin (VT) gene screening from food materials. The pure culture and foods such as sliced beef, tandoori paste, cucumber, etc. were used for this study. The sensitivity was obtained as 3 to 4 log CFU\/mL in enrichment broth (BPW and mEC), which was cultured with food matrices. These results showed this detection kit was suitable the notification of standard methods from Ministry of health, which requires 4 log CFU\/mL as detection limit in enrichment broth. This assay was useful as a rapid and simple screening method for VT gene from foods.","20":"A rapid, easy and versatile analytical method based on three-layer extraction was developed for the determination of tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) in foods. In this method, degreasing with n-hexane, partitioning into acetonitrile, and purification by the salting-out were simultaneously performed after extraction with acetone. It allowed to prepare a test solution without concentrating, transferring, and purification using solid phase extraction column. As a result, TBHQ for a wide variety of 11 foods met the management criteria of the guideline for validity assessment (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan).

Of 645 samples, 2 samples (0.3%) were positive for pathogenic E. coli. Of 2 pathogenic E. coli positive samples, 1 was EHEC (stx2 positive) and the other was ETEC (sta positive). Two pathogenic E. coli strains were isolated from crisphead lettuce. EHEC strain was not serotyped by commercial antisera and ETEC was serotyped as O20. EHEC and ETEC strains showed multi-drug resistance against 4 and 7 antibiotics, respectively. These results indicate that retail fresh vegetables seem to be not an important source of human EHEC and ETEC infection in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam.","24":"The mouse bioassay (MBA) for paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in bivalves has been used as an official method in Japan. It is necessary to develop an alternative method to animal experiments in PSTs assay because 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) of animal experiments are required from the animal welfare point of view. Various methods such as HPLC-FL, receptor binding assay, LC-MS\/MS and ELISA have been established to detect PSTs without performing animal experiments. The present study was undertaken to develop a screening method using oligonucleotide lateral flow immunoassay (OLFIA) for detecting PSTs in bivalves. The screening level was defined as positive at 2 MU\/g of MBA that is the half regulation limit of PSTs monitoring in Japan. All 20 positive (equal to or more than 2 MU\/g) samples judged from MBA showed a positive reaction in the OLFIA. No positive samples resulted in a false negative reaction. The OLFIA exhibited high accuracy at 2 MU\/g of screening criteria. The authors demonstrated here that the OLFIA can be useful for rapid detection of PSTs in bivalves.","25":"Boiled noodles are considered to be one of the most perishable foods due to their high moisture content and high water activity. Thus, the hygiene control measures based on HACCP manuals has been recommended in the noodle manufacturing industry. However, there were several cases in which post-packaged products manufactured at the Boiled noodles factory of small-to-medium size company detected a viable cell count higher than their voluntary standards. To identify the source of microbial contamination, an investigation based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle was conducted. The results showed that the bacteria causing the contamination were environmental bacteria. Secondary contamination occurred during the cooling process after sterilization. Airborne environmental bacteria and oxygen may have been introduced into the rinsing and cooling water tank by the strong water flow during the rinsing and cooling process, inducing growth of microorganisms in the cooling water and contaminating the final product. This is a new finding, as such occurrence was not listed in the HACCP manual and should be contributed to plan HACCP system.","26":"The main component of the Mustard and Horseradish extracts, which are used as natural food additives in Japan, is allyl isothiocyanate (AITC). The determination of AITC using GC-FID is the official method employed in the quality control assessments for these products. In this method, a commercially available AITC reagent is used as a calibrant. However, 1H-quantitative NMR (qNMR) analysis revealed that the AITC reagents contain impurity. Therefore, we examined the GC-FID and HPLC-refractive index detector (LC-RID) method based on relative molar sensitivities (RMSs) to high-purity single reference (SR). The RMSs of AITC\/SR under the GC-FID and LC-RID conditions were accurately determined using qNMR. The AITC in two types of food additives was quantified using qNMR, SR GC-FID, and SR LC-RID methods. Both SR GC-FID and SR LC-RID showed good agreement within 2% with the AITC content determined by direct qNMR.","27":"The diazotization method is used for nitrite determination in meat products. In this method, it is known that the presence of reducing substances such as ascorbic acid and cysteine in the sample interferes with nitrite determination. We speculated that soy sauce, fish sauce and mirin, which are used in meat products, might be the reducing substances, so investigated meat products which contain soy sauce and other ingredients. The results showed that quantitative disturbance was observed in soy sauce and fish sauce, and the recovery in spiked samples of these products decreased in proportion to the increase in soy sauce and fish sauce content. However the antioxidant of soy sauce and fish sauce depending on manufacturing methods, so quantitative disturbance dose not be observed each time, so nitrite determination in meat products, and to conduct simultaneous determination using different sample amounts to confirm whether there is any difference in the quantitative values.","28":"A microwave digestion method for the analysis of tin, arsenic and lead in soft drinks was studied and its performance was evaluated. The trueness, repeatability (RSD) and Intralaboratory reproducibility (RSD) of the method were estimated to be in the ranges of 93-100, 0.7-6.1 and 0.9-8.6%, respectively. In the preparation of the samples for tin analysis, the addition of sulfuric acid after microwave digestion improved the recovery rate and reproducibility. To verify the applicability of this method, recovery tests were conducted on five types of soft drinks, and the results were satisfactory. It was confirmed that this method is applicable to the digestion of a wide range of soft drinks and to the analysis of tin, arsenic, and lead, and that it reduces working time and makes the work easier compared to the conventional method.","29":"This study determined the configuration of the isomers of tadalafil, nortadalafil, and homotadalafil in dietary supplements. The products purchased over the Internet studied included a honey product and a tablet, which contained tadalafil, and a candy, which contained nortadalafil and homotadalafil. Each of the pharmaceutical ingredients isolated from the products was measured with circular dichroism (CD).As a result, the CD spectrum of each isolated pharmaceutical ingredient was found to align with the standard CD spectrum of the 6R,12aR isomer, confirmed that each isolated tadalafil or tadalafil analogue included in a 6R,12aR isomer. According to a report, among the stereoisomers of tadalafil, the 6R,12aR isomers have the most potent inhibitory activities of phosphodiesterase-type-5. From the report, the potential strength of the inhibitory activity of the 6R,12aR isomers of nortadalafil and homotadalafil was suggested. Therefore, it seemed that the 6R,12aR isomer often used in the product.","30":"Benchmark dose (BMD) method have been used in the toxicological assessment of chemical substances so that the point of departure can be derived, as an alternative to the use of no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL), and the method is often applied to the incidence data of histopathological findings in the toxicity studies. In the present study, the BMD method was applied to various patterns of incidence data derived from some toxicity studies as case studies, and the validity of each application was discussed. Five independent applications including toxicity studies of madder color or semicarbazide hydrochloride were prepared and model averaging over the three models with the lowest three AIC (Akaike information criteria) values (MA-3), a recently proposed model averaging method, was employed. The series of case studies indicated, for the better application of the BMD method to histopathological findings, the following points:(i) If there are incidence data with severity grading of pathologically significant lesions, we must discuss whether the BMD method should be applied to the total incidence data or the incidence data above certain grade with or without data aggregation.(ii) If a lesion of interest had higher toxicological significance rather than the secondary lesions with higher severity, the BMD method should be applied to the incidence data of the lesion of interest.(iii) If it is highly necessary to apply the BMD method to obtained incidence data without toxicological and statistical validity, toxicological pathologists are advised to review individual datasets of histopathology and associated data, and provide new incidence data of comprehensive findings (diagnostic name) such as hepatocellular injury or nephropathy, if possible. In all cases, toxicological significance and mechanism of a lesion of interest need to be considered in light of the dose-dependence. In view of both toxicology and statistics, sufficient discussions must be made on the validity of applying BMD method and its estimate.","31":"We studied the efficiency of methylation for analyzing brominated vegetable oil (BVO). In this report, we investigated whether 1H-NMR is an applicable method for assessing the efficiency of methylation to analyze BVO. 1H-NMR sufficiently calculated the efficiency of methylation using each integral and the numbers of protons derived from the methyl group, which is characteristic in products, and the methine group, which is characteristic in unreacted substances. Additionally, the efficiency of methylation calculated via 1H-NMR was in good agreement with changes in the peak area of BVO fatty acid methyl esters (BVOFAMEs) after various heating times obtained from GC-FID analysis. Therefore, 1H-NMR is applicable for calculating the efficiency of methylation to analyze BVO.","32":null,"33":"Microbial risk assessment in food safety is a valuable tool to reduce the risks of infection by pathogens. The dose-response relation is aimed to establish the relationship between the dose of a pathogen that populations are exposed to and the probability of the adverse health effect by the pathogen. Among many dose-response models ever proposed, the exponential and beta-Poisson models have been internationally applied, but the decision on which model is selected between them solely depends on the goodness of fit to specific data sets. On the other hands, the log-logistic model, one of the alternative models, has been little studied on the dose-response relation. In the present study, thus, the application of the log-logistic model to dose-response relation was studied with hypothetical and experimental data sets of infection (or death), comparing to the above two models. Here the experimental data sets were for pathogenic organisms such as pathogenic Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Cryptosporidium pavrum. Consequently, this model successfully fit to those data sets in comparison to the two models. These results suggested that log-logistic model would have the potential to apply to the dose-response relation, similar to the exponential and beta-Poisson models.","34":null,"35":null,"36":"Marine pufferfish Takifugu exascurus is not approved for human consumption due to the lack of information on its toxicity.

In this study, a nationwide internet survey was conducted to clarify the understanding and attitudes of dietitians towards the FFC 1 year and 4 years after its introduction (Surveys were conducted in 2015 and 2019, respectively). In the survey of 1 year after the introduction, the ratio of recognition of the FFC was 98%; however, only 35% correctly understood the characteristics of the FFC. Similarly, in the survey of 4 year after the introduction, only 42% of dietitians correctly answered the characteristics. At 4 year after, 56% of dietitians currently or previously have used the FFC. The dietitians who had been consulted about the use of the FFC accounted for 22% and about the adverse events accounted for 15%. The advice they gave at the consultation differed according to their experience of the use of the FFC. Of the ones who never used the FFC, 25% referred no information sources for the FFC. The place to educate primarily working dietitians needs to be prepared to let them provide appropriate information to consumers to support self-care including the appropriate use of the FFC.","38":"We evaluated an analytical method to detect pesticide residues in agricultural products through the use of a self-cleaning ion source GC-MS\/MS. The self-cleaning ion source minimizes ion source contamination by ensuring that hydrogen is pumped into the source at a fixed pressure after or during measurement. When we employed our self-cleaning ion source GC-MS\/MS technique to analyze pesticides residues in agricultural products, we observed that pollution of the ion source surface was considerably reduced. Good peak sensitivity was obtained for 251 pesticides, and a calibration curve with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.990 or higher was obtained for 253 pesticides. In the recovery test with 6 types of agricultural products, the acceptability criteria of recovery (70-120%) and standard deviation of repeatability (RSD&lt;25%) was met in 180-221 pesticides.","39":"An analytical method based on LC-MS\/MS was developed for the determination of asulam in livestock products. Asulam in livestock products was extracted with acetone. The crude extracts were defatted by acetonitrile and n-hexane partitioning.

For the quantification of GM maize, we experimentally determined the Cf values targeting Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (P35S), GA21 construct specific, MIR604 event specific and MIR162 event specific sequences using the four real-time PCR instruments.","43":"The Japanese official analysis method for determination of nitrate ions in food products used as food additives is associated with various challenges. In some kinds of cheese, the extract becomes suspended. The volume of extracted solution is often not accurate owing to the presence of residues in the solution. Moreover, the determination with liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is difficult owing to the influence of impurities. Sake usually does not contain lipids or proteins ; therefore, its analysis can be simplified by omitting the co-precipitation steps to remove them. In the present study, for cheese, the amount of sodium hydroxide solution that causes suspension was reduced, and the influence of residues was removed by adjusting the volume after suction filtration. Whereas, sake was diluted with water and centrifuged. Furthermore, solid-phase extraction (SPE) method using cartridge containing carbon molecular sieve to remove the influence of impurities on the chromatogram was successfully established. The recoveries of the nitrate ions were good outcomes of 91.3-99.6% (CV 0.9-4.5%) (n=5). The analysis range was 0.010-0.20 g\/kg for cheese, 0.010-0.20 g\/L for milk, and 0.010-0.10 g\/kg for sake. The developed analysis methods are considered useful, because various challenges of the official analysis method can be solved and the operation are efficient.","44":null,"45":"The fate of organophosphorus flame retardants (PFRs) in polished rice during the cooking process was examined. After adding PFRs to polished rice (500 ng\/g), the rice was washed with water and cooked in a rice cooker. Among the seven kinds of PFRs, approximately 68-86% of the PFRs residues were removed after washing with water three times. In the first washing with water, approximately 50-70% of the PFRs residues were removed from rice. By the subsequent heating in an electric rice cooker or in a microwave rice cooker, the removal rates of PFRs in the cooked rice were 74-94 and 78-96%, respectively. The removal rates in musenmai (500 ng\/g) which need not to wash before cooking were lower than those in the washed rice. In the cooked musenmai, 10-50% of the PFRs residues were removed after heating in the electric rice cooker, and 10-70% were removed in the microwave rice cooker. The washing process is effective to reduce the intake of PFRs from rice.","46":null,"47":"Total organic carbon (TOC) was measured in some kinds of mineral water, and the method was validated. In mineral water, there are many kinds of elements such as carbon dioxide and a wide range of hardness. The official method for amount of TOC in tap water was validated in non-carbonated mineral water regardless of the degree of hardness. However, the amount of TOC was not accurately measured in two kinds of carbonated mineral water with medium or high degree of hardness. In our method of this study, the removal of carbon dioxide from the two kinds of mineral water was achieved by making bubbling time longer and additive rate of HCl upper than the official condition of tap water. And then, the method we developed was validated in the two kinds of mineral water. Our results suggested that the method we developed could be useful to measure the amount of TOC in many kinds of mineral water on the market.","48":null,"49":"Herein, we quantified the concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) in 63 milled rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivated in Japan, Vietnam, and Indonesia. We estimated the daily intake of Cd and As by adults and children consuming this rice by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Cd and As were detected in all milled rice samples. No significant differences were observed in Cd concentrations between Japanese (50th percentile concentration: 0.036 mg\/kg), Vietnamese (0.035 mg\/kg), and Indonesian rice (0.022 mg\/kg). However, As concentrations in Vietnamese rice (50th percentile concentration: 0.142 mg\/kg) were significantly higher than those in Japanese (0.101 mg\/kg, p&lt;0.001) and Indonesian rice (0.038 mg\/kg, p&lt;0.0001). Target hazard quotients (THQs) were then calculated to evaluate the non-carcinogenic health risk from ingestion of individual heavy metals (Cd and As) by rice consumption. Results revealed that THQs of individual heavy metals for Japanese, Vietnamese, and Indonesian adults and children consuming this rice were all less than one, suggesting that no health risk is associated with the intake of a single heavy metal via rice consumption.","50":null,"51":null,"52":"To recognize the risk of Bacillus cereus in pasteurized milk, we investigated the prevalence of B. cereus and the rate of the production of cereulide from B. cereus isolates.

The ces gene was identified in 3 out of 90 B. cereus isolates that were isolated from three samples (one product) among the 101 samples. The ces gene positive isolate, the reference strain F4810\/72 and a B. cereus isolate collected in a food poisoning incident were shown the productivity of cereulide using an LC-MS\/MS analysis. The LC-MS\/MS analysis was confirmed the ability of identification and quantification of cereulide produced in the milk samples. In this study, it was shown that B. cereus strains are prevalent in pasteurized milk, some of these strains produce cereulide, and confirmed usefulness of LC-MS\/MS analysis to detect cereulide in milk.","53":"A rapid and sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of fipronil and fipronil sulfone (metabolite B) in livestock products was developed. The analytes were extracted from samples with acidic acetonitrile. The crude extracts were subjected to clean-up step using neutral alumina cartridge column. The HPLC separation was performed on a C18 column with isocratic elution of acetonitrile and ammonium formate solution. For the determination of the analytes, a tandem mass spectrometry with negative ion electrospray ionization was used. In the recovery tests using 6 livestock products fortified with MRLs levels of analytes, the truenesses for fipronil and fipronil sulfone were 95 to 115 and 94 to 101% with the repeatabilities of 0.8 to 4.1 and 0.9 to 5.1 RSD%, respectively. The limits of quantification for both analytes were estimated to be 0.001 mg\/kg.

This is essential, as inconsistencies in values are commonly encountered. To visualize the degree of these discrepancies in each food matrix, we compiled a validation study based on a routine method developed in our laboratory, for 121 pesticides in six agricultural products, namely the grapefruit, potato, paprika, cabbage, spinach, and brown rice. These were analyzed by GC-MS\/MS and LC-MS\/MS, and the results were compared mainly on the basis of trueness. According to the results of the validation study when using GC-MS\/MS, of the 121 pesticides tested in each product class, the number of analytes that satisfied the criteria of the Japanese validation guidelines was 97 in grapefruit, 111 in potato, 110 in paprika, 118 in cabbage, 111 in spinach, and 63 in brown rice. In contrast, in the analysis of the same samples by using LC-MS\/MS, the number of analytes that satisfied the criteria of the validation guidelines was 50 in grapefruit, 114 in potato, 103 in paprika, 112 in cabbage, 100 in spinach, and 103 in brown rice. Inconsistences in the differences of trueness were mainly attributed to matrix effects of each instrument, as well as to food matrices, of which the most diverged matrix was that of brown rice (over 20%).","56":null,"57":"In this study, we developed an LC-MS\/MS-based rapid and simple analytical method for six fungicides; imazalil, o-phenylphenol, thiabendazole, fludioxonil, azoxystrobin and pyrimethanil, the latter three were newly approved for use after 2011. For expediting and simplification, we merged the extraction method with that of the pesticide analysis. For purification step, loading of 1 mL of sample extracts to 500 mg Oasis HLB column and elution with 8 mL of acetonitrile gave satisfactory results. The performance of the present method was confirmed for orange, grapefruit, and lemon samples fortified with the six fungicides. The results showed that the average recovery ranged from 89.7 to 100.0%, intra- and inter-assay CV% ranged from 1.5 to 5.0% and from 0.5 to 4.9%, respectively, achieving the target values of the Japanese official guideline for residual pesticide analysis. The limits of quantification of this method were determined to be 1 mg\/kg for o-phenylphenol, and 0.2 mg\/kg for the other five fungicides. These values were lower than their corresponding regulation values. In addition, we confirmed the usability of the present method for fungicide inspection of commercially available citrus fruits. During 2017-2019, there was no conflict between the food labeling and the fungicides detected and no fungicide with the concentration exceeding maximum residue level was detected.","58":null,"59":null,"60":"Campylobacter is one of the most important causes of food-borne infectious diseases. Antibiotics are rarely needed to treat campylobacteriosis, but occasionally used in severe or prolonged cases. Consumption of contaminated bovine liver is a source of campylobacteriosis. Bovine liver can be contaminated with Campylobacter on the surface and inside by the bile at slaughterhouses. Therefore, we investigated the current prevalence and characteristics of Campylobacter in bovine bile at a slaughterhouse. Campylobacter was isolated from 35.7% (55\/154) of bile samples. C. jejuni and C. fetus were the two most frequent species. High antimicrobial resistant rates in C. jejuni were observed against tetracycline (63.0%) and ciprofloxacin (44.4%). Multi-locus sequence typing divided C. jejuni isolates (27 isolates) into 12 sequence types (STs) in which ST806 was the most frequent ST and accounted for 37.0%. All C. fetus were identified as C. fetus subsp. fetus which can cause systemic infections. High antimicrobial resistant rates in C. fetus were observed against ciprofloxacin (66.6%), streptomycin (58.3%) and tetracycline (33.3%). All the C. fetus isolates were divided into two STs, ST3 (16 isolates) and ST6 (8 isolates). Of the 16 ST3 isolates, 15 (93.8%) were resistant to both streptomycin and ciprofloxacin. Our data shows high prevalence of Campylobacter in bovine bile and their high rates of antimicrobial resistance. Preventing bile contamination of bovine liver at slaughterhouses is thus considered to be one of control measures to reduce the risk of Campylobacter infections.","61":"Fumonisins, which are secondary metabolites produced by some Fusarium species, are detected mainly in corn and corn-based products. Recently, the presence of modified forms of fumonisins in fumonisin-contaminated food products has been reported. In order to evaluate the health risk of modified forms of fumonisins to the Japanese population, we analyzed modified forms of fumonisins in corn-based products retailed in Japan. The modified and free forms of fumonisins in food samples were hydrolyzed by alkaline treatment. The resulting hydrolyzed fumonisins were quantified by LC-MS\/MS, and total fumonisins (sum of modified and free forms) was calculated. A total of 166 samples of corn-based products were analyzed over two years. The relative ratios of mean total fumonisins to mean free fumonisins in the cornflakes, corn snacks, corn flour and powdered corn soup samples were 4.7, 2.8, 2.1 and 1.2, respectively. Total fumonisins in the residual solid of five cornflake and three corn snack samples obtained after extraction with methanol-water (3 : 1) were quantified. In the cornflakes and corn snacks samples, 56-72 and 83-98% of the modified forms of fumonisins were present in the residual solid, respectively. The average daily intake of fumonisins from cornflakes and corn snacks by the Japanese population was estimated at 1.1 to 3.9 ng\/kg body weight\/day when the results of free fumonisins were used for the estimate, but when the results of total fumonisins were used, average daily intake increased about three times and was estimated at 3.3 to 12.5 ng\/kg body weigh\/day. These results indicate that a risk assessment of fumonisins, including the modified forms of fumonisins, is necessary in order to evaluate the true risk of fumonisins to Japanese people.","62":"The determination of antibacterial agents for animals in swine muscles was improved by microbiological screening and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) analyses. In the first instance, the residual drugs were extracted from the samples using the Na2EDTA-McIlvaine buffer (pH 6.0). Subsequently, the agents were purified utilizing a PLS-3 cartridge and extracted with acetonitrile. Considering the microbiological methods, the sensitivities of the investigated drugs were higher and the test plate conditions were improved using a new reference organism Geobacillus stearothermophilus. As a result, a microbiological screening approach able to detect 33 drugs at MRL was developed in Japan. Remarkable, no false positives were detected. Moreover, the same preparation method enabled rapid and reliable microbiological screening, resulting in efficient screening with no undeterminable results.","63":"Ascaris lumbricoides or roundworm is one of the key soil-transmitted helminths affecting humans. A small number of infections continue to occur in Japan, suggesting plant foodstuff contamination as the source of infection. To understand the current status of ascariasis incidence and to identify potential sources of infection, we extensively surveyed the available literature and collected data from testing facilities that examined clinical samples or foodstuffs. We observed that from 2002 onwards, there was a decrease in the number of ascariasis cases reported in scientific journals. Data from a clinical testing facility indicated that the number of detected cases declined remarkably from 2009. Foodstuff testing facilities reported that 11 of 10,223 plant foodstuff specimens were contaminated with anisakid nematodes but not with Ascaris. Imported kimchi was suspected as the most probable source of ascarid nematode infection, as one Ascaris egg-positive sample was detected among 60 kimchi samples in a testing facility. Therefore, the sources of Ascaris infection are still not fully known and need to be clarified to establish preventive countermeasures to safeguard Ascaris infections that continue to occur in Japan.","64":null,"65":"Most fish contain some kinds of organoarsenic compounds. To assess the health risk for the chronic effects due to intake of these compounds, it is necessary to quantify the concentration of each chemical form, since the toxicity is difference depending on the form. We developed and validated the LC-MS\/MS method to determine the concentration of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO), tetramethylarsonium (TeMA), arsenobetaine (AB), and arsenocholine (AC) in fish. Using this method, we quantified the concentration of each organoarsenic compounds and total arsenic in 50 fish samples from across 10 groups. Total arsenic concentration ranged from 0.53 to 25 mg\/kg in all samples, except for in thread-sail filefish where the concentration ranged from 8.3 to 25 mg\/kg. With the exception of sardines, in all samples AB was found at the highest level in relation to the total arsenic concentration. In sardines, the concentration of DMA was higher than that of AB, accounting for 16 to 24% of total arsenic. In red sea bream, concentrations of total arsenic, AB, and AC in farm-raised fish were lower than those in wild-caught fish.","66":"","67":"Total diet study (TDS) is a useful way to estimate the dietary intake of hazardous and chemical substances. Regarding the analysis performed in TDS, international guidelines published by the World Health Organization, recommend selecting and confirming the validity of suitable analytical methods to achieve the purpose of TDS. However, concrete procedures and\/or approaches for confirming the validity of suitable methods have yet to be established. In the present study, we aimed to develop samples, referred to as SEMPs; Samples to estimate methods performance, that can be used to evaluate the performance of the analytical methods applied to the composite samples prepared in TDS. The concentrations of 14 kinds of elements, including hazardous substances such as arsenic, lead, and cadmium, in SEMPs were measured for use in the validation of a multi-element analytical method for estimating dietary intake. After examining the appropriate amount of relevant elements added to the samples, we established a performance evaluation procedure by repeatedly analyzing five fortified and non-fortified SEMPs each.","68":"As a method to detect pesticide residues in agricultural products, we evaluated the pretreatment of agricultural product samples by the solid-phase extracton technique with QuEChERS (STQ) method followed by GC-MS\/MS with large-volume injection using a stomach-type glass-lined injector. This method satisfied the target criteria of recovery (70-120%) and the standard deviation of repeatability (RSD&lt;25%) in 238-282 pesticides found in six types of agricultural products.","69":"DNA from hair that has undergone retort pouch sterilization shows considerably more fragmentation. Assessing the extent of DNA fragmentation using a PCR assay could therefore be applied to infer the sterilization history of a contaminated food sample. Such assessments could make it possible to determine whether a food sample had been contaminated by hair during the production process. To determine the extent of retort pouch sterilization, primers specific for the detection of human DNA were designed to give an amplification product of approx 500 bp. Hair was subjected to retort sterilization as a model of contamination, and PCR was performed using the extracted DNA as a template and the primer set for determining retort pouch sterilization. The results showed that no DNA amplification occurred in retort pouch samples, whereas amplification was observed in samples that were unheated, heated in hot water, or heated in a microwave oven. The present method was thus able to specifically detect thermal decomposition of DNA from hair that had undergone retort sterilization, and will be useful for determining whether hair discovered in a retort pouch was responsible for contamination.","70":"Some illegal dietary supplements contain phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil, for exerting \"therapeutic\" effects in erectile dysfunction. This is apparently dangerous, and thus, should be appropriately regulated. Identification of descarbonsildenafil was first reported in Singapore in a coffee sample labeled to exert male sexual performance enhancement effects. However, it is unclear whether the compound possesses PDE5 inhibitory activity. We encountered during our survey of dietary supplements, a sexual enhancement product commercially available in Tokyo, in which a peak presumed to be of descarbonsildenafil was detected by LC-UV and electrospray ionization-tandem MS (ESI-MS\/MS). The compound was isolated and identified as descarbonsildenafil with liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS), NMR, and X-ray crystal structural analysis. In addition, descarbonsildenafil showed PDE5 inhibitory activity in PDE5 inhibition assay, and its IC50 value for PDE5A1 was found to be 30 nmol\/L. The results of INADEQUATE NMR and X-ray crystal structural analysis in this study provide information for the identification of descarbonsildenafil. Since this study indicates that this compound is a PDE5 inhibitor having adequate activity, it is regulated as a drug component in Japan.","71":"The mouse bioassay for tetrodotoxin has been used in Japan and ddY strain mice are designated to be used in the assay. ddY strain is a closed-colony outbred mouse strain, originally from the National Institute of Health, however, the ddY mouse stocks of 3 breeders were divided 30 or more years ago. In this study, we investigated the differences in susceptibility to tetrodotoxin in ddY strain mice from 3 different breeders in Japan. No statistically significant differences were found among the ddY strain mice of 3 breeders, however, the coefficient of variation were different among the breeders. The results using the mice from one breeder were much stable compared with those using the mice from other 2 breeders.","72":"An identification method for testing contamination in products was assessed using various vegetables and fruits (70 types in total). DNA was extracted from plant fragments which are 1 to several millimeters long and the plastid rpl16-rpl14 linker sequence (approximately 550 base pairs) was amplified by PCR. The DNA nucleotide sequence was determined, and homology and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analyses were carried out. Consequently, the test plants were difficult to distinguish between closely related species, but could be divided into 38 groups at the genus level or the species level. Although problems such as the accuracy of discrimination among some closely related plants and DNA stability under an acidic condition remain to be resolved, this method is considered to be expected to identify plant fragments mixed in products or raw materials.","73":null,"74":"Some rice bran pickles contain histamine (Him) and tyramine (Tym), which are nonvolatile amines, presumably produced by microorganisms during the fermentation process. When attempting to identify the histamine- and tyramine-producing bacteria from commercially available cucumber rice bran pickles containing Him and Tym, it was identified histamine-producing bacteria were found to be Raoultella ornithinolytica, and tyramine-producing bacteria were Lactobacillus curvatus. When those bacteria were cultured in media containing rice bran (the raw material for rice bran pickles), Him and Tym were produced. However, it was suggested that Him and Tym were not necessarily produced by the presence or absence of amine-producing bacteria, but rather, their production was affected by the amount of precursor amino acids and other bacteria that were present during rice bran pickles production.","75":"We used ion chromatography with post column derivatization to measure chromium (VI) concentrations in 155 mineral water (MW) products purchased from markets in Japan in 2018. Chromium (VI) recovery in spiked samples of the 155 MW products ranged from 95 to 106%, suggesting that this method is well suited for ensuring that MW products meet the requisite health and food safety standards. Chromium (VI) levels were above detection limits in 54 of the MW products, giving a total detection rate of 35%. The minimum and maximum chromium (VI) concentrations in all of the MW products were 0.0001 mg\/L and 0.045 mg\/L, respectively. The median chromium (VI) concentration was 0.0003 mg\/L, with most MW products having chromium (VI) concentrations in the range of 0.0001 to 0.0002 mg\/L. None of the MW products had chromium (VI) concentrations that exceeded the current standard value (0.05 mg\/L) for MW in Japan.","76":"This paper deals with proficiency testing schemes for food nutrition analysis in Japan. In schemes in 2017 and 2018, 65 and 73 organizations participated, respectively, and more than 70% of the participants were public organizations responsible for a nutrition-labeling compliance test. The food matrices were pork and chicken sausages, and analytes were protein, fat, ash, moisture, carbohydrate, energy, sodium, salt equivalent, calcium (2018 only), and iron (2018 only). The organizations reporting inadequate laboratory values in one or more nutrients for mandatory declaration (energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, or salt equivalent) were 11 and 15% of all organizations and 9 and 13% of public organizations in the 2017 and 2018 schemes, respectively. The approximate relative standard deviations for proficiency assessment (RSDr) were as follows: protein, 2%; fat, 3%; ash, 2%; moisture, 0.5%; carbohydrate, 9%; energy, 1%; sodium (salt equivalent), 4%; calcium, 7%; and iron, 7%. Notably, the large RSDr value for carbohydrate may cause inconsistency among laboratories in compliance tests for foods containing several grams or less of carbohydrate per 100 grams.","77":"Violation of the Food Sanitation Act regarding detection of Patent Blue V, which is one of the non-permitted dyes for food in Japan, in imported food occurs every year. With respect to the identification of dyes of Patent Blue group, in some cases, each dye has several different names, and in other cases, different dyes have the same name. Thus, there is a risk that the detected dye is misidentified with other dyes of Patent Blue group. In this study, nine commercial available dyes of Patent Blue group, including a reagent with unclear product information, were analyzed by TLC, HPLC and LC-MS\/MS. The result showed that with all three methods, the dyes could be clearly identified into one of four types of blue dyes, i.e. Patent Blue V, Azure Blue VX, Isosulfan Blue and Alphazurine A. Unification of nomenclature would reduce the risk of misidentification of dyes of Patent Blue group.","78":"Considerable amounts of processed foods contain vitamin D (ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3)) as food additives. For field surveys on food additives, the analytical method for vitamin D should be well-validated. However, the current official method in Japan cannot separately determine the concentrations of D2 and D3, whereas the method for the Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan 2015 (STFC method) can. Therefore, in this study, we verified the applicability of the STFC method to processed foods. During the course of this research, we added some improvements to the original method. Spike and recovery experiments using vegetable juice, soymilk, and corn flakes as food matrices showed that the recovery rates (relative standard deviation) of D2 and D3 were 103-112% (4.7-12.6%) and 102-109% (2.4-21.8%), respectively, at the estimated method limit of quantification (EMLOQ) level; and 100-110% (4.0-7.4%) and 102-105% (3.8-4.8%), respectively, at 10 times the EMLOQ level. These results indicated that accuracy and precision of the modified STFC method were enough to determine dietary D2 and D3 as endogenous nutrients and\/or food additives, and suggested that this method is appropriate for analyzing vitamin D concentrations in processed foods.","79":"Alkali-heat DNA extraction, a rapid and economical method, was evaluated for use in the detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in food using real-time PCR assays. Alkali-heat DNA extracts led to highly sensitive detection (102-104 CFU\/mL) of stx and O-antigen genes in beef liver, ground beef, sliced pork, cheese, lettuce, radish sprouts, tomato, and spinach, equivalent to the sensitivity obtained using a commercial DNA extraction kit that utilizes proteinase K lysis, and silica membrane purification. Although there were differences in DNA concentration and purity between DNA extraction methods, the sensitivity of real-time PCR assays was similar. These results indicate that alkali-heat DNA extraction is a viable method when testing food products with real-time PCR assays for the presence of stx and O-antigen genes.","80":null,"81":"Histamine in foods with a high histidine content may be produced by bacteria with histidine decarboxylase activity. Consumption of food enriched in histamine can produce symptoms of histamine poisoning that include flushing, headache, and urticaria. The number of histamine poisoning cases in Japan has decreased with developments in food hygiene management technology. However, approximately 10 cases are still reported each year. In addition, there have been cases where histamine was detected in the end products, prompting large product recalls. To prevent and identify causes of histamine toxicity, manufacturers must identify the bacteria causing the illness. A simple method of identification is needed, since sequence-based identification is complicated to perform and the analysis takes a long time. High-Resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA) is a method that detects differences in the base sequences of PCR products manifested as varied melting temperatures of double-stranded DNA. The present study was intended to develop a rapid identification method for major histamine-producing bacteria using HRMA. Species-specific HRMA primers were designed that specifically targeted the hdcA gene of 20 Gram-negative histamine-producing bacterial strains. The designed primers were used for HRM analysis of the 20 histamine-producing bacterial strains. The strains were divided into three groups (A, B, and C) based on differences in melting temperature values obtained by Tm Calling analysis program. Group A comprised terrestrial bacteria, such as Morganella, Enterobacter, and Raoultella, while Groups B and C comprised marine bacteria, such as those belonging to the genera Vibrio and Photobacterium. The melting profiles obtained in Group A by HRMA were used to identify the aforementioned terrestrial bacteria. The findings indicated that HRMA can easily identify the major gram-negative histamine-producing bacteria. A flow chart was created to identify histamine-producing bacterial species. This method enables the identification of histamine-producing bacterial species more quickly and easily than conventional sequence-based methods. Therefore, the method could be valuable for food companies to screen raw materials and products and track the source of contamination, which will in turn contribute to the prevention of histamine-food poisoning and investigation of its causes.","82":"In order to clarify the actual situation of indoor pollution to polished rice with organophosphorus flame retardants (PFRs) which are ubiquitous in the indoor environment, the pollution of PFRs to polished rice stored in a house for a week was investigated. The survey covered 64 ordinary families in the Osaka region. We analyzed six typical PFRs in 37 rice samples in 2015, and ten typical PFRs in 27 rice samples in 2016. Polished rice was homogenized with acetone-hexane and defatted by hexane-acetonitrile partition. Quantitative analysis for PFRs was performed by GC-FPD. The detection frequency of PFRs in the rice samples was 35\/37 in 2015 and 27\/27 in 2016. The highest values were 160 ng\/g for TCEP, 500 ng\/g for TCIPP and 430 ng\/g for TBEP. The concentration ratio of each detected PFR in the polished rice samples was different in each house. In the analysis of 16 polished rice samples which were stored in the home, PFRs were detected in ten samples regardless of the storage methods. PFRs were detected from 12 out of 16 commercial brown rice samples. This result suggested that they were polluted during distribution and storage process of them.","83":"In some of the EU member countries, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, chicken eggs contaminated by fipronil used without authorization were identified and widely reported. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan stated no contaminated imports had been found in the country while promising to strengthen monitoring chicken eggs coming from those areas. Meanwhile, there are no reports published to show whether or not chicken eggs produced in Japan contain such pesticide. This paper, therefore, examined 50 commercial brands of chicken eggs produced and sold in Japan to identify 116 kinds of agricultural chemicals including fipronil.None of these brands contained fipronil. Among the 50 brands studied, 45 brands did not include any of the 116 kinds of agricultural chemicals. Spinosad was detected in the four brands with the concentration levels ranging from a trace to 0.019 ppm. Diflubenzuron was found at 0.005 ppm in one of the chicken brands. No brands exceeded the maximum residue limits.","84":"It is well-known that a strange flavor, known as off-flavor, might be found in various food products. Even though these substances do not affect our body directly, they can cause a significant change in food flavor and smell, thereby lowering the quality of food products. A well-known example of off-flavor is the transfer of smell from one food product to another. We have previously studied how the smell of limonene, a flavor component of orange juice in paper cartons, is transferred from unopened packages to milk stored in paper cartons, and have confirmed cases where the milk develops a smell completely different from that of limonene. This smell was also confirmed to not have originated from orange juice, and was found to be similar to that of a halogenated phenol. This study aimed to identify this odor component, and our findings indicate the off-flavor component to be 2-iodo-4-methylphenol.","85":"Qualitative real-time PCR method for three poisonous Entoloma rhodopolium-related species in Japan was established using specific primers and FAM, VIC, Texas Red, Cy5-labeled probes. The use of multicolor probes can extend the method to simultaneous detection of different targets. Standard plasmids were constructed as reference materials. Designed primers and probes in the method detect only a target species, and the detection limit was 12.5 copies or below. This indicates it is highly specific and sensitive enough to detect the poisonous mushrooms in food residues. Next, we applied the method to four food residue samples obtained from food poisoning cases. The real-time PCR method did identify all of four samples as E. subrhodopolium and E. pseudorhodopolium, whereas PCR-RFLP did not. The method established here revealed Entoloma rhodopolium-related species in Hokkaido were different species such as E. eminens and unknown species.","86":null,"87":"An analytical method for the determination of zilpaterol in livestock products was developed. The sample was stirred with n-hexane and n-hexane saturated acetonitrile, and zilpaterol in the sample was extracted with acetonitrile. The extract was cleaned up on a ODS cartridge column (1 g) and SCX cartridge column (500 mg). The LC separation was carried out using an Inertsil ODS-4 column and linear gradient elution with 0.1%formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid as mobile phase. Detection of MS was carried out positive ion electrospray ionization mode. Average recoveries (n=5) of zilpaterol from 6 kinds of livestock products fortified at the MRLs (0.01 mg\/kg) were 87.0-99.4%, and the relative standard deviations were 2.4-6.3%. The limits of quantitation were 0.01 mg\/kg.","88":"LC\/Tribrid Orbitrap was developed to determine phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and their analogs as adulterants in dietary supplements. High-resolution MS\/MS and MS3 spectra of PDE-5 inhibitors and their analogs were obtained by LC\/Tribrid Orbitrap using both higher-energy collisional dissociation and collision-induced dissociation. We investigated dietary supplements that claim to enhance men's sexual performance, and detected PDE-5 inhibitors and their analogs. We also estimated the structures of the PDE-5 inhibitor analogs and the impurities of PDE-5 inhibitors and their analogs in the dietary supplements.","89":"Microbial colony counts of concern of food products are one of the most important items in microbiological examinations. The distributions of colony counts per agar plate of food samples are considered to be reflected with microbial cell distributions in food homogenates. However, (i) the probabilistic distributions of the colony counts per agar plate at the dilution of counting and (ii) the relationship between the colony counts per plate and the number of agar plates for food samples have not been intensively studied so far. In this study, therefore, these two points were studied with raw food samples of raw minced beef and chicken and raw milk and microbial culture samples of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among four major probabilistic distributions, it was found that aerobic plate counts per plate of the foods were well described with negative binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions and that the colony counts per plate of microbial cultures were described well with binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions. The effect of the number of agar plates on the estimation of the mean of colony counts per plate of a sample was then studied with the data randomly resampled from the experimental data. The resampled data showed that with more number of plates the mean of counts fluctuated less and the coefficients of variation of colony counts per plate decreased further, which were coincident to the estimated by the central limit theory. Our study would provide useful information on the characteristics of colony counts per plate of food samples which are routinely examined.","90":null,"91":"Multilayer laminated films may contain organic solvents derived from adhesives, printing inks and so on.

A N,N-dimethyl formamide solution containing an internal standard substance was added to the sample. After leaving overnight at room temperature, the headspace gas was analyzed by GC\/MS. This method was applicable to a laminate film made of various materials. The organic solvents such as toluene, ethyl acetate, and heptane were detected from 6 out of 42 food packaging bags made from laminated film on Japanese market using this method.","92":"Foods with Function Claims are allowed to label health claims based on scientific evidence evaluated by the manufacturers. To prevent health problems caused by inadequate use, the manufacturers should label proper safety information. To evaluate whether safety information is sufficiently provided, we conducted the adverse event review focused on popular functional ingredients using the database; Information system on safety and effectiveness for health food. The data suggested that causal factor of adverse events related to products containing soy isoflavone, ginkgo biloba extract and docosahexaenoic acid\/eicosapentaenoic acid were overdose intake, concomitant use with certain medicines, and use by whom with an allergic predisposition. However, the safety information on the label was insufficient to prevent adverse events on each products' label. It is important not only to encourage food manufacturers to provide sufficient information based on safety review, but also to inform consumers about adverse events.","93":null,"94":null,"95":null,"96":"A method was developed for the determination of nonvolatile amines, such as histamine, tyramine, putrescine, and cadaverine, in foods.

The four amines were derivatized with fluorescamine, determined by HPLC with a fluorescence detector, and confirmed by LC-MS\/MS. The average recoveries (n=5) and the relative standard deviations from 11 foods (pacific saury, dried mackerel, canned mackerel in brine, canned tuna in oil, fish sauce, surimi, rice-koji miso, soy sauce, gouda cheese, red wine, and beer) spiked at 100 mg\/kg were 81-100% and 0.4-3.1%, respectively.","97":"We developed an analytical method for determining 15 antifungal drugs, 2 antiparasitic drugs, and 3 veterinary drugs in fish and livestock products using LC-MS\/MS. First, 50% ethanol was added to their products, and the mixture was homogenized to reduce drug degradation. Thereafter, 20 drugs were extracted from the pretreated sample mixture using acetonitrile. Cleanup was performed using an alumina-N SPE cartridge. Finally, chromatographic separation was performed using a fully porous octadecyl silanized silica column. The new method is applicable to fish in which the matrix hampers accurate analysis. It was validated on 8 fish and livestock products. Drug recovery rates ranged from 70.2 to 109.3%, RSDs of repeatability were &lt;18.0%, and RSDs of within-laboratory reproducibility were &lt;18.7%. It fulfills the Japanese guideline criteria.

We examined the susceptibilities of 1,115 E. coli isolates obtained from chicken, beef, pork, venison, and wild boar meat from 2011 to 2017 in Tokyo to 14 antimicrobials (ampicillin, cefotaxime (CTX), streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline (TC), chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, imipenem, and meropenem). Of all the tested isolates, 18.7% (135\/721) isolates from chicken, 77.0% (117\/152) from beef, 46.6% (89\/187) from pork, 100% (28\/28) from venison, and 92.6% (25\/27) from wild boar meat were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials. Furthermore, TC resistance was the most common, with rates as high as 56.7% (409\/721) and 40.6% (76\/187) in the isolates from chicken and pork, respectively. CTX resistance was detected in 4.9% (25\/506) of the isolates from domestic chicken and 23.7% (51\/215) of the isolates from imported chicken. Moreover, CTX resistance rate in isolates from domestic chicken was significantly lower in 2016 (0.9%, 1\/111) and in 2017 (0.8%, 1\/121) than in 2012 (10.6%, 17\/161). In conclusion, E. coli isolates from retail meat were most commonly resistant to TC, and CTX resistance was higher in E. coli isolates from imported chicken than in E. coli isolates from domestic chicken.","99":"Analytical survey of plasticizers used in about 500 polyvinyl chloride (PVC) toys in Japanese market was performed in 2014. The results obtained were compared with those obtained in 2009. Fifteen types of plasticizers including di (2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHTP) were detected. These plasticizers were also detected in the products in 2009, suggesting that the types of plasticizers used in PVC toys have not been changed. Among these detected plasticizers, the detection ratios of DEHTP were 60.3 and 73.7% in both designated and not-designated toys, respectively, both of which are the highest. These ratios are over 20-points higher than those in 2009. The six types of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) prohibited to use for the designated toys in Japan were not detected in designated toys used in this study. However, four types of PAEs, including three types of prohibited PAEs, were detected in not-designated toys with the detection ratios from 2.8 to 15.5%. These ratios are lower than those in 2009. The content levels of plasticizers used in the toys are lower than those in 2009. These results show that the main plasticizer used in PVC toys is DEHTP, and that the usage levels of plasticizers have been decreased.","100":"","101":"To ensure food safety during emergency events such as nuclear disasters, we developed a practical rapid determination method for strontium-90 (Sr-90) in foods. Purification of Sr from foods was simplified using a commercial Sr-extraction column. We also reduced the waiting time to achieve radiative equilibrium between Sr-90 and Y-90. Finally, we developed a rapid determination method for Sr-90 that can be completed in about a week. Using the new method, stable Sr recoveries exceeded 85%. The trueness of the method ranged from 109 to 115% and the detection limit of Sr-90 was estimated to be 0.07 Bq\/kg fresh weight according to a performance evaluation using standard materials. Sr-90 radioactivity concentrations in food samples determined by the new method were highly correlated and nearly equal to concentrations determined by the conventional method. The present study suggests that the new method offers highly sensitive and rapid detection of Sr-90 which are necessary attributes for food tests during emergency events.","102":null,"103":"Microbial concentrations of thermally processed foods are mostly low. Recently we proposed a stochastic method based on the MPN technique for estimating microbial concentration in a food product whose concentration is low. Namely, with the number of target pathogen-positive samples in the total samples of a food product by a qualitative examination, the concentration of the target microbe in the product was estimated with the stochastic method. However the credible interval of the estimate with the method was not yet studied. Also the method was not validated with foods yet. The present study showed the 95% credible interval of the estimation by the method with the maximum likelihood analysis. Also the present study showed the reliability of the method experimentally by using a powdered formulae for infants product and a liquid food model injected with Salmonella cells. This method could estimate as low as seven and two cells\/1,000 g or 1,000 mL, respectively. Next, the estimated concentrations and 95% credible intervals of Enterobacteriaceae in fresh meat for eating raw were demonstrated at various Enterobacteriaceae-positive numbers of the sample with the present method. Further, the characteristics of the present method on the sample size and the aliquot of sample were clarified. These results suggested that the present method could be a good tool to verify microbiological safety of food products.","104":null,"105":"The aluminium (Al) content of Japanese confectionery and foods containing flour was investigated. Some of these items were investigated in previous studies, which examined foods that made use of baking powder containing aluminium potassium sulfate (Alum). Al was detected in 41 of the 123 samples at levels ranging from 0.01 (limit of quantitation) to 0.40 mg\/g. The detection rate of Al in almost all confectionery (except Japanese confectionery) was decreased as compared with previous studies. However, the detection rate of Al in Japanese confectionery and foods containing flour was high. For 4 of the 41 samples tested, consuming one serving once a week would result in an Al intake exceeding the PTWI for young children (body weight=16 kg).","106":"Chocolate and cocoa are manufactured from cacao beans produced by the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). These products may contain cadmium (Cd), which originates from contaminated soil. Here, we surveyed the Cd concentrations in dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate and cocoa powder products purchased at retail stores in Japan, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The Cd concentrations in these chocolate and cocoa powder products ranged from 0.00021 to 2.3 mg\/kg and from 0.015 to 1.8 mg\/kg, respectively. A weak positive correlation was found between the Cd concentration and the content of cocoa solids stated on the product labels. A comparison between these results and the maximum levels (MLs) set by the European Union revealed that the Cd concentrations in chocolate and cocoa powder products on the Japanese market exceeded the MLs for eight of the 180 chocolate products and 26 of the 140 cocoa powder products.","107":"Polymorphism in the mitochondrial gene ND5 enables the determination of the order, a taxonomic rank, of many insects from the 5 major insect orders-Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. DNA nucleotide sequences of multiple species were determined and more than 19 nucleotides characteristic of each order were identified; this makes it possible to discriminate insects at the order level more precisely and easily than when using conventional techniques.","108":"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a common infectious agent that causes acute hepatitis worldwide. Since the incubation period of HAV infection is about one month, it is difficult to identify the source of infection based only on medical interviews. Molecular epidemiological analysis of HAV isolated from patients can help to reveal the infection route and to identify diffuse outbreaks caused by common food vehicles. In the present study, samples were collected from 108 cases notified to the active epidemiological investigation system in Tokyo between 2016 and 2017. Samples found to be HAV-positive by semi-nested RT-PCR were subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic analysis; the results were analyzed together with the epidemiological data. HAV was detected in 99 out of 108 cases. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 99 HAV strains were divided into 91 of genotype IA, two of IB, and six of IIIA. The 91 HAV strains typed as IA were further divided into four main line-ages, IA-1, IA-2, IA-3, and IA-4, each with a unique epidemiological background. Our nucleotide sequence database of HAV and epidemiological background data will be helpful to investigate sources of infection and the epidemiology of hepatitis A cases in the future.","109":null,"110":null,"111":null,"112":null,"113":null,"114":"We recently reported polymorphism in the mitochondrial genes of Tribolium castaneum, a stored grain pest. Here, we show that T. castaneum samples from the main island of Japan can be easily differentiated from samples from other areas by using real-time PCR with minor groove binding (MGB) TaqMan probes containing a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to amplify a 179-bp fragment. This assay was also applicable to samples stored at room temperature for 5 months after natural death, and samples whose DNA was artificially degraded by heat, pressure, or gamma-ray irradiation.","115":null,"116":null,"117":null,"118":null,"119":"In order to validate an HPLC-UV method for the determination of free asparagine, which is a precursor of acrylamide, in grains using dansyl derivatization, an inter-laboratory study was performed in 9 laboratories using 5 kinds of grains (non-glutinous brown rice flour, corn flour, strong flour, whole wheat flour, and whole rye flour), which naturally contain free asparagine. The relative standard deviations for repeatability (RSDr) and reproducibility (RSDr) were in the ranges of 0.5-2.2 and 2.3-5.9%, respectively. The HorRat values ranged from 0.4 to 0.6. These results were within the range of the procedural manual of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, and therefore the method is effective.","120":null,"121":"Colchicum autumnale is a perennial, toxic plant that originated in Europe and North Africa. Although inedible, it is occasionally consumed accidentally because it resembles the edible Allium victorialis and other related species. This misidentification has led to episodes of food poisoning in Japan. However, determining the causative agent of a food poisoning outbreak by observing the sample visually or analyzing the chemical composition is challenging when dealing with small samples. Therefore, we developed a novel set of PCR primers that anneal to the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of C. autumnale ribosomal DNA, designed to detect the presence of C. autumnale in small samples. These primers successfully detected C. autumnale in all samples in which it was present, and did not give a positive PCR band in the 48 other distinct crop species tested, in which it was not present. Further, our method could amplify DNA from samples of C. autumnale that had been heat-treated and digested using artificial gastric fluids. Thus, this PCR strategy is highly specific and can be used to distinguish C. autumnale simply and rapidly from various other crops.","122":"A method for the determination of hexazinone and three metabolites (hexazinone metabolite B, hexazinone metabolite C, hexazinone metabolite F) in livestock products by LC-MS\/MS was developed. Hexazinone and the three metabolites were extracted from a sample with acetonitrile in the presence of n-hexane, and lipid was removed by acetonitrile\/n-hexane partition. The acetonitrile extract was cleaned up using a SAX\/PSA cartridge column. Average recoveries (n=5) of hexazinone and the three metabolites from cattle meat, fat, liver and milk spiked at the maximum residue limits (MRLs) or at 0.0025 mg\/kg ranged from 85.6 to 96.0%, and the relative standard deviations ranged from 0.8 to 4.9%.","123":"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a common pathogen in developing countries, and causes foodborne infections through contaminated vegetables and water. ETEC also caused some foodborne infections in developed countries, though the vehicles are often unclear. We analyzed ETEC foodborne outbreaks in Japan based on the National Food Poisoning Statistics. Vegetables and private well water accounted for 50% and 22.2% of vehicles, respectively. The main vehicles were similar to those in developing countries. Serogroups of ETEC were also analyzed, and O6, O25, O27, O148, O153, O159, and O169 were the seven major O-serogroups. We investigated suitable detection methods for the pathogen (O148) in food samples associated with an outbreak of ETEC in Japan in 2011. We show that ETEC O148 could be effectively detected in cut leeks by means of a two-step enrichment and real-time PCR assay targeting heat-stable enterotoxin gene. Our survey of the vehicles and the major O-serogroups of ETEC outbreaks in Japan indicates that ETEC survives in the environment in Japan.","124":null,"125":"We examined whether the analytical method of patulin (a mycotoxin found in fruit juice) developed in Nagano prefecture meets the criteria in the Codex Procedural Manual and Guidelines on Analytical Terminology. The trueness, repeatability, within-laboratory reproducibility and HorRat value were 98.8-103.4%, less than 6.4, 8.1 and 0.4%, respectively, for apple juice and pear juice.Thus, the trueness and precision met the required criteria.","126":"Highly processed foods, including soy sauce, cornflakes, starch sugar, beet sugar and vegetable oil, are not currently subject to genetically modified (GM) food labeling, because DNA could not be detected in these food products. Here we re-examined the method of DNA extraction from starch syrup, beet sugar and vegetable oil using commercially available DNA extraction kits. We found that DNA was not stably detected by PCR targeting a species-specific endogenous plant gene. The reason for this may have been that the DNA yield was below the detection limit, because PCR inhibition was not observed.","127":"We carried out a collaborative study in six laboratories to confirm the universality of the enhancing effect of co-existing reference pesticides on the GC-MS peak response to a target pesticide (malathion, procymidone, or flucythrinate). First, we confirmed the response enhancement of the target pesticides with increasing numbers of co-existing reference pesticides in solution. Then, using diluted green soybean matrix, we analyzed the target pesticides with two types of matrix-matched calibration, containing the target pesticides or 166 other pesticides. In both cases, the response-enhancing effect of co-existing pesticides was confirmed in all laboratories. The enhancement was reduced by addition of green soybean matrix to the sample and calibration solutions. Our results show that it is necessary to estimate the peak response-enhancing effect of co-existing pesticides in the calibration solution to obtain accurate results with GC-MS determination. The enhancing effect could be reduced by addition of food matrix to the sample and calibration solutions.","128":"Vitamins are essential nutrients for human beings. Therefore, accurate determination of vitamin levels in foodstuffs is vital to confirm the proper intake of vitamins. The microbiological assay (MBA), which is used worldwide for the determination of several vitamins in foodstuffs, is very sensitive and can determine ng\/mL levels of vitamins. However, the correlation between vitamin concentrations in a sample solution and the plotted growth is usually shown as a sigmoid curve. Therefore, a calibration curve derived from a linear regression may lead to error. In this study, we evaluated the effects of various models (linear, quadratic, and cubic regression models and a four-parameter logistic model (4PLM)) for calibration curve construction on the determination of vitamin B6 in infant formula. Among the four models, the calibration curve constructed with 4PLM was the most reliable for vitamin B6 determination. Moreover, the calibration curve based on 4PLM showed robustness for extrapolation; even if the vitamin concentration in the sample solution deviated from the range of the standard solution, a reasonable result could be obtained. Similarly, the 4PLM calibration curve was the most reliable for niacin determination. We conclude that 4PLM should be used for calibration curve construction to improve the reliability of vitamin determination in foodstuffs using MBA.","129":"Food poisoning caused by natural toxins, especially poisonous plants, is characterized by severe symptoms and a relatively high mortality rate. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of the causative agent is extremely important. From plant toxin food poisoning data published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan from 1989 to 2015, we selected five plants (Veratrum spp., Datura spp., Aconitum spp., Narcissus spp. and Colchicum spp.) that are frequently involved in poisoning outbreaks, and developed a PCR-RFLP assay to discriminate them. Separation of the PCR-RFLP products by electrophoresis resulted in detection of two fragments from poisonous plants and one from edible plants. The PCR-RFLP method is rapid and straightforward and does not require expensive analytical devices. This assay was also confirmed to be applicable to cooked samples.","130":null,"131":"We have developed a rapid analysis method for determination of histamine using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescamine derivatization. Histamine was extracted from foods with trichloroacetic acid after homogenization. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation was filtered and derivatized without solid-phase extraction. The mobile phase was 10 mM phosphate-acetonitrile (75 : 25) without ion-pairing. Recovery tests of histamine from fishes, seasoning and fish products gave acceptable recovery (95.8-117.7%). This method should be useful for rapid evaluation of food poisoning outbreaks.","132":"In order to investigate the feasibility of using the rare sugar d-arabinose as a functional food material, we examined its toxicity in rats. In an acute toxicity study, the lethal dose (LD50) was calculated to be 12.1 g\/kg in males and 11.6 g\/kg in females. On the other hand, in a short-term toxicity test, rats developed diarrhea when given feed containing 5% d-arabinose, which was the minimum amount added, so the maximum nontoxic amount was estimated to be less than 5%. Thus, the toxicity of d-arabinose is stronger than that of another rare sugar, d-psicose, which was reported to show no toxicity when added at 10% in the diet. Further studies are needed to establish whether d-arabinose would be safe for use as a functional ingredient.","133":"The current adverse event reporting systems are inadequate to prevent potential health damage caused by dietary supplement use, and a better case-collecting system is needed. The aim of this study was to examine whether online surveys would be a useful methodology for estimating ongoing adverse events, focusing on diarrhea as a model symptom. We used four online survey companies and requested that they administer the same questionnaire to their registrants regarding experiences of adverse events associated with supplement use and details of diarrhea symptoms, as well as the product and ingredient names of suspected supplements. Of 78,220 dietary supplement users, 9% to 25% reported experiencing adverse events in the previous year. A total of 723 participants who answered affirmatively about a putative causal relationship between supplement use and the onset of diarrhea and who clearly identified the product and\/or ingredient were eligible for final analysis. Comparisons among the survey companies showed differences in the proportions of reported symptoms; however, the rank orders were consistent in the preliminary survey. Also, when analysis was limited to specific participants from a full-scale survey, even the numerical values of the proportions were consistent among the four companies. Herbal\/botanical ingredients, specifically Coleus forskohlii, were the ingredients most frequently reported to be associated with diarrhea. These results indicate that online survey can be a useful method to complement the current system for estimating ongoing adverse events and identifying the responsible supplements.","134":"An interlaboratory study was performed to evaluate the equivalence between an official method and a modified method of evaporation residue test using heptane as a food-simulating solvent for oily or fatty foods, based on the Japanese Food Sanitation Law for food contact products. Twenty-three laboratories participated, and tested the evaporation residues of nine test solutions as blind duplicates. In the official method, heating for evaporation was done with a water bath. In the modified method, a hot plate was used for evaporation, and\/or a vacuum concentration procedure was skipped. In most laboratories, the test solutions were heated until just prior to dryness, and then allowed to dry under residual heat. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between the two methods. Accordingly, the modified method provides performance equal to the official method, and is available as an alternative method. Furthermore, an interlaboratory study was performed to evaluate and compare two leaching solutions (95% ethanol and isooctane) used as food-simulating solvents for oily or fatty foods in the EU. The results demonstrated that there was no significant difference between heptane and these two leaching solutions.","135":"An interlaboratory study was performed to evaluate the equivalence between an official method and a modified method of evaporation residue test using three food-simulating solvents (water, 4% acetic acid and 20% ethanol), based on the Japanese Food Sanitation Law for food contact products.

Here, we examined whether the antifungal compound allyl isothiocyanate (AIT), which is present in mustard seed, could inhibit the growth of seed-borne fungi and aflatoxin-producing fungi. Peanuts produced in China and Japan were inoculated with A. parasiticus and exposed to AIT vapor released by a commercial mustard seed extract in closed containers under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity. AIT in the inoculated peanut samples reached its highest concentration of 44.8 ng\/mL at 3 hr and decreased to 5.6 ng\/mL after 9 weeks. Although AIT decreased the growth of the seed-borne fungi during the test period, the inoculated fungi survived. All tested peanuts samples were analyzed for aflatoxin using the HPLC method. There was a correlation between the number of aflatoxin-producing fungi and the total amount of aflatoxin production in the inoculated peanut samples. Our results indicate that AIT was effective in inhibiting the growth of seed-borne fungi and aflatoxin-producing fungi.","138":null,"139":null,"140":null,"141":null,"142":"Analysis of L-ascorbic acid (AsA) and erythorbic acid (ErA) in foods is generally performed by HPLC measurement after extraction with metaphosphoric acid solution. But this method can not always measure the concentrations of AsA and ErA precisely due to the presence of interfering compounds, and the reproducibility of retention time is poor. We considered that quantitative analysis by HPLC and confirmation by LC-MS\/MS using an identical extraction solvent might be an effective approach for AsA and ErA analysis. Chelate fiber was added to the sample, followed by extraction with acetic acid solution containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt, purification with Oasis MCX, and 2-fold dilution with methanol. The resulting solution was used for quantification by HPLC using a ZIC-HILIC column and identification by LC-MS\/MS. In recovery tests with 8 kinds of foods, the recovery of AsA was over 91%, and that of ErA was over 88%. The RSD was 5.1% or less for both analytes. Analysis of 8 kinds of foods by both methods showed that this method gave better RSD values than the conventional method. AsA and ErA in all samples were confirmed by product ion scanning and selected reaction monitoring of LC-MS\/MS.","143":"We designed an off-line combination of HPLC\/photodiode array detector (PDA) and 1H-quantitative NMR (1H-qNMR) to estimate the relative molar sensitivity (RMS) of an analyte to a reference standard. The RMS is calculated as follows: a mixture of the analyte and the reference is analyzed using 1H-qNMR and HPLC\/PDA. The response ratio of the analyte and the reference obtained by HPLC\/PDA is then corrected using the molar ratio obtained by 1H-qNMR. We selected methylparaben (MPB), which is a certified reference material, as the reference standard and hesperidin (Hes) and monoglucosylhesperidin (MGHes) as analytes, and the RMSs of Hes283 nm\/MPB255 nm and MGHes283 nm\/MPB255 nm were determined as 1.25 and 1.32, respectively. We determined the contents of Hes and MGHes in processed foods by the conventional absolute calibration method and by the internal standard method employing the RMS values with respect to MPB. The differences between the values obtained with the two methods were less than 2.0% for Hes and 3.5% for MGHes.","144":"The prevalence of dietary supplement use has increased in Japan, and consumers can purchase supplements from foreign countries through the internet. Therefore, it is important to consider both domestic and overseas safety alerts to prevent adverse events associated with dietary supplement use. We have been collecting global safety alerts associated with dietary supplements and providing this information to the public via the \"Information system on safety and effectiveness for health foods (HFNet)\" website. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of safety alerts from 2010 to 2016 in HFNet (total: 2,124 alerts). The most common reason for alerts was illegal adulteration with pharmaceutical substances (85%), and sexual enhancement or weight loss products accounted for 68% of all alerts. Most alerts were based on market surveillance reports or recall information. However, 181 adverse event reports were identified, and most of them were related to weight loss or disease treatment in patients. In Japan, a majority of the adverse events was caused by products intended for weight loss or purchased online, and young female users were commonly involved. These findings should be helpful for prevention of adverse events associated with dietary supplement use.","145":null,"146":"Health foods are commonly consumed at their own discretion by patients with various diseases who are also being treated with conventional drugs. Both health foods and drugs are diverse, and enormous numbers of possible combinations exist, so that it is very difficult to identify adverse events that may occur due to their interactions. Here, we analyzed the characteristics of adverse events related to the concomitant use of health foods and drugs using data from the \"Information system on safety and effectiveness for health foods (HFNet)\" website (https:\/\/hfnet.nibiohn.go.jp\/) compiled by the Food Function and Labeling Department of the National Institute of Health and Nutrition of Japan. We identified 64 reports and 71 patients, and characterized them according to symptom severity and drug classification. The analysis revealed that symptoms of liver dysfunction were mainly reported in patients receiving high-risk drugs, such as antiepileptic, antineoplastic, antiarrhythmic, and antithrombotic drugs, concomitantly with health foods or drugs. However, journal articles describing health food and drug interactions generally did not provide sufficient information about the ingredients of the health foods.","147":"The recoveries of xanthene dyes in the analysis of acidic tar-dyes in high-protein foods were improved by loading them onto polyamide columns at pH 8.5, instead of using the conventional pH 3-4 solution. The experimental scale was reduced to approximately half that of the conventional method. Furthermore, instead of eliminating the organic solvent in the extract by evaporation, the extract was diluted with water prior to PA column cleanup in order to reduce the ratio of organic solvent so that acidic tar-dyes would be better retained on the column. The above two procedures shortened the operation time and allowed for a simpler protocol. With this method, the recoveries of erythrosine, phloxine, and rose bengal from salted cod roe were 82, 88, and 74%, respectively. The recovery percentages were greatly improved compared to those achieved by conventional column loading at pH 3.5 (26, 44, and 18%, respectively). The recoveries of azo-dyes (Amaranth, New Coccine, Allura Red AC, Tartrazine, Sunset Yellow FCF) were also improved from 41-66 to 79-99%.","148":"Amnesic shellfish poison (ASP) is regarded as one of the shellfish poison groups in the EU, though it is not subject to regulation in Japan. We have developed an analytical method of ASP based on the report by Hatfield et al. and other methods. Validation studies were carried out with certified compositional reference materials (CRM). Performance parameters were estimated based on 17 analytical results. The estimate of trueness was 97.5%, and the estimate of intralaboratory reproducibility (RSD) was 1.5%. The HorRat(r) value was 0.16. These performance parameters meet the criteria in the Codex Procedural Manual. Furthermore, internal quality control was performed by using the CRM. The action limits were set based on the performance parameters of the method. Most of the results of the internal quality control were within the action limit range. The results confirmed that the quality of the analyses was well maintained. The purpose of the analytical method is to confirm that the level of ASP in scallop is less than 4.6 mg\/kg. The applicability of the analytical method to scallops was confirmed by using spiked samples.","149":"We developed and evaluated a method of quantifying chromium(VI) in mineral water (MW). After a performance evaluation, we performed a surveillance of chromium(VI) concentrations in 150 kinds of MW products purchased from markets in 2016. Recovery rates, as examined by using 150 spiked samples prepared from the purchased MW products, ranged from 93 to 107%. These results strongly suggest that the validated method is suitable for quantifying chromium(VI) in MW. Chromium(VI) was detected in 65 kinds of MW products; the detection rate was 43%. The minimum concentration of chromium(VI) was 0.0001 mg\/L and the maximum was 0.0019 mg\/L. The median value of chromium(VI) concentration was 0.0003 mg\/L. In most of the products in which chromium(VI) was detected, the concentration ranged from 0.0001 to 0.0002 mg\/L. No products were found with concentrations higher than the value (0.05 mg\/L) set by the Food Sanitation Law as the specification for MW.","150":"The interaction of levodopa and vitamin B6 is a well-known issue. This study investigated the incidence of unacceptable intake levels of vitamin B6 among levodopa users by means of a systematic review. We searched two databases (PubMed and \"Igaku Chuo Zasshi\") for articles about adverse events due to the interaction of levodopa and vitamin B6 published up to August 2017. Of 98 citations retrieved, 11 studies met the selection criteria. The results indicated that a vitamin B6 intake level of more than 50 mg\/day could reduce the efficacy of levodopa. The recommended intake of vitamin B6 for Japanese adults is 1.4 mg\/day for men and 1.2 mg\/day for women. Therefore, the acceptable intake of vitamin B6 for levodopa patients would be within the range of the recommended intake level, which is also within the usual range in foods in Japan, except for dietary supplements or health foods. Levodopa users should be cautious about taking dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs.","151":"In February 2017, four food poisoning outbreaks occurred in Tokyo, involving ten schools. Shredded dried laver seaweed processed by a single food manufacturer in December 2016 was provided in common for the school meals that caused all four outbreaks. Of 4,209 persons exposed, 1,193 (28.3%) had symptoms of gastroenteritis. Norovirus (NoV) GII was detected in 207 (78.1%) of 265 cases by real-time RT-PCR. Thirty-one shredded dried laver seaweed samples were examined and seven (22.6%) of them were positive for NoV GII. PCR fragments of NoV ORF1\/2 junction region (302 bp) from seven shredded dried laver seaweed samples and 20 clinical samples derived from the four outbreaks were sequenced. All of them displayed complete homology, and the genotype was classified as GII.17. A nearly full-length sequence (7,420 bp) of NoV RNA derived from a case was obtained by next-generation sequencer analysis and phylogenetic analysis indicated that this strain belongs to the same cluster as Hu\/GII\/JP\/2015\/GII.P17_GII.17\/Kawasaki308. Thus, our investigation elucidated that the causative agent of these four serial food poisoning outbreaks was NoV GII.17 and the infectious source was a single batch of shredded dried laver seaweed. The water activity of the shredded dried laver seaweed was found to be 0.119 to 0.129. It was epidemiologically clarified that NoV does not lose infectivity for about two months even in the dry state. We conclude that a large diffuse outbreak of food poisoning caused by NoV GII.17 contamination of shredded dried laver seaweed had occurred in Tokyo. Our elucidation of the causative agent indicated that the food poisoning outbreaks in multiple areas of Japan, including Tokyo, during January to February 2017 were caused by the same contaminated food.","152":"In November 2015, a patient presented with symptoms of toxicity after eating whole boiled samples of the scavenging gastropod Nassarius (Alectrion) glans \"Kinshibai\" in Nagasaki. This food poisoning case was the third recorded in Japan. The case was investigated by evaluation of the toxin profile of the gastropod, and monitoring of tetrodotoxin (TTX) levels in serum and urine sampled from the affected individual. One gastropod contained a harmful dose of TTX (2.5 mg\/ individual in food residue sample 2). In biological samples, maximum TTX concentrations were 42.8 ng\/mL in serum on the day after onset of symptoms. TTX urinary excretion was calculated to be 2.4 mg. From the measured TTX concentrations, it was estimated that a lethal dose had been ingested in this case. Moreover, it was found by LC-QqQ-MS\/MS analysis and mouse bioassay that the toxicity of \"Kinshibai\" was not solely due to TTX. The remaining toxicity was thought to be due to 11-oxoTTX. As in previous poisoning cases, it was concluded that ingestion of this gastropod poses a high risk of food poisoning.","153":null,"154":null,"155":"Adverse events associated with health food use appear to be quite common. Nevertheless, even though severe adverse events should be reported to the Japanese government via public health centers, the number of cases reported is relatively small. To clarify this discrepancy and to understand how consumers and physicians act when they or their patients develop adverse events due to health food use, we conducted an internet questionnaire with consumers (preliminary survey: n=44,649; full survey: n=3,000), physicians (n=500), and pharmacists (n=500). During 2016, 17% of consumers who used health foods developed adverse events. However, only 11% of them reported their adverse events to public health centers. Most physicians and pharmacists did not report these cases to public health centers because they were unable to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship. It is important to encourage not only consumers, but also physicians and pharmacists to report adverse events to public health centers.","156":null,"157":null,"158":"New automatic pretreatment equipment (FASVED; Food Automatic Analytical Systems for Veterinary Drugs) was developed. FASVED consists of ten main units: reagent dispenser, homogenizer, transfer hand, lid opening\/closing device, centrifugal separator, pipette, shaker, column purification device, centrifugal evaporator and cooling device, and it is capable of freely combining operations by these units. A validation study was performed on two methods for determination of 178 veterinary drugs in livestock products, swine muscle, egg and shrimp, according to the method validation guideline of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. The numbers of analytes that satisfied the criteria of the guideline were 148 in swine muscle, 160 in egg and 151 in shrimp.","159":"During 2015-2016, we examined norovirus (NoV) RNA in swab specimens collected for investigation of suspected food poisoning outbreaks in Tokyo by real-time RT-PCR. Of 1,726 swab samples, 65 (3.8%) were NoV-positive and all positive swab samples were derived from NoV-positive outbreaks. Swab specimens were positive in 41 of 181 (22.7%) NoV outbreaks, while no positive swabs were detected in NoV-negative outbreaks. PCR fragments amplified from 32 swabs were sequenced, and all of them displayed complete homology with sequences from clinical and food samples. Though the results of swabs may be useful for determining the causative agent and infection route in some outbreaks, there was no case in which the results of swabs alone could elucidate the cause of food poisoning. Swabs may be useful in food poisoning investigations, if the results are interpreted in conjunction with epidemiological findings and clinical data. Swab samples are often collected several days after an outbreak, and the influence of disinfection should be taken into consideration. In NoV outbreaks, 55 out of 640 (8.6%) restroom swab specimens were NoV-positive whereas six of 618 (1.0%) were positive among kitchen swab specimens. In the restroom, the toilet bowl (43.6%) showed the highest positive rate and next was the toilet seat (14.5%). Additionally, NoV was detected at various sites in the restroom, including doorknob and floor. Since NoV-positive swab specimens may suggest that sanitation management is not performed properly in the facility, swab results may be utilized as a basis for hygiene guidance.","160":"An LC-MS\/MS method for the determination of diniconazole in agricultural products, livestock and marine products was developed. Diniconazole in agricultural products was extracted with acetone. The extract was concentrated and partitioned with n-hexane and 10% sodium chloride solution. Agricultural products such as grains and beans were defatted using n-hexane-acetonitrile. Livestock and marine products were extracted with a mixture of acetone and n-hexane, and the organic layer was evaporated to dryness. The residue was defatted using n-hexane-acetonitrile. Cleanup was carried out using a Florisil cartridge column and a graphitized carbon cartridge column for these samples. The LC separation was carried out on an Inertsil ODS-3 column with a linear gradient of 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. MS was carried out in the positive ion electrospray ionization mode. The calibration curve was linear between 0.00125 to 0.00750 mg\/L. Average recoveries (n=5) of diniconazole from 16 kinds of agricultural products, livestock and marine products fortified at the MRLs (0.01 ppm) were 88.3-108%, and the relative standard deviations were 0.5-5.1%.

The analytes were extracted from samples with acetone containing acetic acid. The crude extracts were defatted by liquid-liquid partition using acetonitrile and n-hexane followed by solid-phase extraction using a cartridge column packed with divinylbenzene-N-vinylpyrolidone copolymer bearing sulfo groups. The analytes in the eluate from the cartridge column were extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of ammonium sulfate. The solvent was removed from the extract, and the residue was dissolved in 0.1 vol% formic acid. The HPLC separation was performed on a C18 column with a gradient formed from water containing 0.1 vol% formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1 vol% formic acid. For detection of the analytes, tandem mass spectrometry with positive ion electrospray ionization was used. The recovery tests were performed on 10 livestock and fishery products. The truenesse ranged from 74.6 to 111.1%, with repeatability of 0.5-8.3 RSD% for the entire procedure. The limit of quantification was 0.0001 mg\/kg for IPZ, IPZ-OH, MNZ and MNZ-OH, and 0.0002 mg\/mg for DMZ, RNZ and HMMNI.","163":"Microbial concentration in samples of a food product lot has been generally assumed to follow the log-normal distribution in food sampling, but this distribution cannot accommodate the concentration of zero. In the present study, first, a probabilistic study with the most probable number (MPN) technique was done for a target microbe present at a low (or zero) concentration in food products. Namely, based on the number of target pathogen-positive samples in the total samples of a product found by a qualitative, microbiological examination, the concentration of the pathogen in the product was estimated by means of the MPN technique. The effects of the sample size and the total sample number of a product were then examined. Second, operating characteristic (OC) curves for the concentration of a target microbe in a product lot were generated on the assumption that the concentration of a target microbe could be expressed with the Poisson distribution. OC curves for Salmonella and Cronobacter sakazakii in powdered formulae for infants and young children were successfully generated. The present study suggested that the MPN technique and the Poisson distribution would be useful for qualitative microbiological test data analysis for a target microbe whose concentration in a lot is expected to be low.","164":"Stainless steel kitchenware and tableware on sale in Japan were investigated. Surface elemental composition ratios of 172 samples were analyzed by the fluorescence X-ray method. High levels of manganese (9.59-20.03%)were detected in 17 samples. This finding was confirmed by ICP analysis. Next, we conducted migration tests. Samples conformed to the Italian Specific Migration Limits. Moreover, lead and antimony were not detected in these samples, in accordance with the Japanese Food Sanitation Law.","165":null,"166":"We evaluated the effectiveness of new cleanup agents (S-NH2 and S-Si) compared with other previously reported cleanup agents (octadecylsilane, graphitized carbon, aminopropyl and silica gel) for removal of interfering substances such as catechin and caffeine prior to analysis of pesticide residues in tea. S-NH2 and S-Si were highly efficient in removal of catechin and caffeine, respectively. Recoveries of 80 pesticides using S-NH2 and S-Si were tested, and more than 70% of pesticides showed recovery greater than 70%. These results indicate that S-NH2 and S-Si agents will be useful for analysis of pesticide residues in tea.","167":null,"168":"An analytical method for the determination of residues of 3 phenicol drugs (chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol and florfenicol) in Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) by LC-MS\/MS was developed. We used the whole body of Ayu, including the bones and internal organs, in addition to muscle. Phenicols were extracted with 90% acetonitrile and an aliquot of the crude extract was cleaned up on a Florisil column (2 g), followed by defatting with n-hexane. The acetonitrile extract was evaporated and the solvent was replaced with phosphate buffer, then the extract was purified on a hydroxylated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer column (200 mg). Finally, sample solution was passed through a deproteination cartridge filter with a lipid removal function. Chloramphenicol was quantitated by means of a calibration curve corrected with salogate standard (chloramphenicol-d5) and thiamphenicol and florfenicol were quantitated based on absolute calibration curves. This method was validated in accordance with the notification of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. As a result of the validation study, the trueness, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility were 85-103, 5-13 and 8-13%, respectively. This method is useful for inspecting residues of 3 phenicol drugs in whole body of Ayu efficiently. Moreover, when chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol are detected by this method, the quantitated value is applicable to decide the compliance of the sample with the specifications and standards of the Food Sanitation Law.","169":"In this study, species-specific identification of five toxic mushrooms, Chlorophyllum molybdites, Gymnopilus junonius, Hypholoma fasciculare, Pleurocybella porrigens, and Tricholoma ustale, which have been involved in food-poisoning incidents in Japan, was investigated. Specific primer pairs targeting internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions were designed for PCR detection. The specific amplicons were obtained from fresh, cooked, and simulated gastric fluid (SGF)-treated samples. No amplicons were detected from other mushrooms with similar morphology. Our method using one-step extraction of mushrooms allows rapid detection within 2.5 hr. It could be utilized for rapid identification or screening of toxic mushrooms.","170":null,"171":"Omphalotus japonicus is a poisonous mushroom that grows in Japan. It can be mistaken for edible mushrooms (Shiitake, Hiratake and Mukitake), and if ingested, it causes food poisoning within 30 min to 1 hr. We established a rapid detection method using PCR-RFLP to identify O. japonicus by restriction digestion of the amplified ITS region. By using Sau96I, Bpu10I, SfcI or DrdI\/HincII as a restriction enzyme, it was possible to rapidly identify and discriminate O. japonicus based on the fragment length. This study also provided a short PCR-RFLP system comprising amplification and digestion of a short 200-bp DNA fragment within the ITS region. The system could identify and discriminate O. japonicus after in vitro gastric digestion of native and heated mushroom samples as a model of food poisoning. In addition, a confirmatory assay using real-time PCR was developed to achieve more sensitive detection of O. japonicus.","172":"\"Food with Function Claims\" was established on April 1st 2015. In the present study, we conducted internet surveillance to examine recognition of \"Food with Function Claims\" among consumers (n=2,060), physicians (n=515), and pharmacists (n=515). The ratio of recognition of \"Food with Function Claims\" was 81% among consumers, 93% among physicians, and 98% among pharmacists. However, only 16% of consumers, 23% of physicians, and 44% of pharmacists correctly understood the characteristics of \"Food with Function Claims\". Only 12% of consumers were using or have used \"Food with Function Claims\". Among \"Food with Function Claims\" users, 26% checked the information about \"Food with Function Claims\" on the website of the Consumer Affairs Agency, Government of Japan. Some of them used \"Food with Function Claims\" for treatment their diseases. In addition, some of them used \"Food with Function Claims\" and medicines concomitantly without consulting their physicians or pharmacists. Consequently, only 8% of physicians and pharmacists were asked about dietary supplement use by their patients, and 2% of physicians and pharmacists had consultations with their patients on adverse events associated with using \"Food with Function Claims\".","173":"A food-poisoning case due to eating the roots of Datura occurred in Kawasaki City, Japan in 2014. The Datura plant was mistakenly collected instead of burdock in a domestic garden. The roots of these plants are quite similar to each other. We presumed that the specimen was the root of Datura, but it was difficult to classify it only from the morphology. Using LC-MS\/MS, we detected atropine and scopolamine from the remaining plant specimen. Therefore, we applied the DNA barcoding method. The results showed that the specimen was classified into Solanaceae family, but not Asteraceae family. Thus, the specimen was confirmed to be Datura species based on both chemical and genetic analyses.","174":"Most fish samples contain methylmercury, that the concentrations very greatly according to the fish species. To avoid the adverse health effects of methylmercury while retaining the benefits provided by fish consumption, it is important to select suitable fish species and to control the amount of the fish intake. We surveyed the concentrations of total mercury and methylmercury in 210 retail fish samples classified into 19 fish species by using validated analytical methods. The results of this survey were as follows. The total mercury and methylmercury concentrations were higher than 1 mg\/kg in some samples of swordfish and bluefin tuna, which are large predatory fish species. In bluefin tuna and yellowtail, total mercury and methylmercury concentrations in farm-raised fish were lower than those in natural fish. There was a positive correlation between total mercury concentration and methylmercury concentration. Our results indicate that a cut-off value of 0.3 mg\/kg total mercury in the screening of fish samples would increase the effectiveness of inspection.","175":"A simple and rapid method was developed to identify the source species of pufferfish products. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was applied to identify 8 species of pufferfish. Commercial kits were used for DNA extraction and amplification. Simultaneous identification was possible by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of PCR products. Two primers were chosen based on the result of pre-examination with 40 primers, and the PCR conditions were optimized. Characteristic RAPD patterns were obtained for each pufferfish species. The developed method was applied to identify the source species of 26 pufferfish products. The results suggest that the developed method would be useful for verification of the labeled species of pufferfish products.","176":"","177":"The prevalence of health foods is increasing in Japan, especially among elderly people. The internet is widely used as an information source, but it is not clear whether elderly people get information about health foods via the internet or not. To clarify this issue, we conducted two questionnaire surveys; one on a website (internet survey) and one in the local community (paper survey). The internet survey showed that a lot of elderly people use the internet to get information and also to purchase health foods. On the other hand, paper survey showed that a smaller proportion of elderly people used the internet, compared to the internet survey. Instead, they got information from their friends, health-care professionals, or various media sources, such as television, newspapers and magazines. Our results indicate that many elderly people don't use the internet to get information about health foods. Adequate ways to inform them about health foods are needed to reduce adverse events associated with health food use.","178":"A validation study was performed on the Japanese official method to determine several elements (B, Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Ba, Pb) in mineral water simultaneously using ICP-MS. The trueness, repeatability and reproducibility of the method were estimated to be in the ranges of 95-106, 0.2-1.4 and 0.4-4.2%, respectively. The values of every performance parameter fulfilled the requirements in the guidelines announced by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan, and the validity of the method was confirmed. The concentrations of the elements in mineral water products purchased from Japanese markets in 2013 and 2014 were surveyed using the method. All products met the specifications defined in the Japanese Food Sanitation Law. No clear relationship between the element concentrations and the survey year or the producing country was found.","179":"A survey of nitrate-ion concentrations in plant-factory-cultured leafy vegetables was conducted. 344 samples of twenty-one varieties of raw leafy vegetables were examined using HPLC. The nitrate-ion concentrations in plant-factory-cultured leafy vegetables were found to be LOD-6,800 mg\/kg. Furthermore, the average concentration values varied among different leafy vegetables. The average values for plant-factory-cultured leafy vegetables were higher than those of open-cultured leafy vegetables reported in previous studies, such as the values listed in the Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan- 2015 - (Seventh revised edition). For some plant-factory-cultured leafy vegetables, such as salad spinach, the average values were above the maximum permissible levels of nitrate concentration in EC No 1258\/2011; however, even when these plant-factory-cultured vegetables were routinely eaten, the intake of nitrate ions in humans did not exceed the ADI.","180":"Histamine food poisoning is caused by ingestion of spoiled fish containing high levels of histamine. This paper reports cases in which histamine was detected in Osaka prefecture in fiscal year 2015 in a survey of fish and fishery products on the market and the food poisoning. A suspected case of histamine food poisoning was also evaluated to investigate the cause and minimize further problems. Histamine in food was separated on SPE cartridge columns, and analyzed after derivatization with fluorescamine by means of HPLC-FL. Histamine was detected in some fishery products on the market and in food that had caused poisoning. The samples in which histamine was detected were semi-dried whole round herring (Urumeiwashi-maruboshi), mackerel (Saba) and sardine dumpling (Iwashi-tsumire). These foods were the main causes of histamine food poisoning according to the report of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Government of Japan.","181":"As a result of the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station (FDNPS) after the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, volatile radionuclides including iodine-131 were released into the environment and contaminated open-field vegetables, raw milk, tap water, etc. It is important for the health care of residents to correctly comprehend the level of their exposure to radioactive substances released following the accident. However, an evaluation of the internal exposure doses of residents of Fukushima Prefecture as a result of the ingestion of foods, which is indicated in the report issued by United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR)1 is based on a number of assumptions. For instance, the estimation assumes that foods were ingested as usual, without regard to the places to which residents were evacuated after the accident, the places where food shipment restrictions were imposed, and so forth. The present report aims to improve the accuracy of estimation of the amount of food actually ingested at evacuation areas, in order to reduce as much as possible the level of uncertainty in conventional values estimated directly after the accident, which were in fact values based on conservative assumptions. More concretely, as basic source material to more accurately estimate internal exposure doses from food ingestion, various patterns of evacuation and dietary habits at the time of the accident of the residents of 13 municipalities in Fukushima Prefecture who were evacuated during the period from directly after the accident of March 11, 2011 until the end of March are clarified in this report. From survey results, most of the food that evacuees took immediately after the accident was confirmed to have been sourced from either stockpiles prepared before the accident, or relief supplies from outside of the affected areas. The restriction orders of food supplies such as contaminated vegetables and milk, and tap water intake were implemented within several days after the major release of radionuclides on March 15, 2011. In addition, collapse in supply chains, i.e., damage to distribution facilities, lack of transportation vehicles or electricity, and the closure of retail stores, contributed to a situation where food or supplies contaminated with iodine -131 were not consumed in large quantities in general, even before the food restriction order. Since people consumed tap water and water from other sources before the implementation of restriction orders in affected areas, we surveyed the status of water as a potential route of internal exposure.","182":"Kuwazuimo (Alocasia odora) and shimakuwazuimo (Alocasia cucullata) are evergreen perennial plants that originated in East Asia. Although inedible, they are occasionally eaten by mistake because they resemble satoimo (Colocasia esculenta), and this has caused food poisoning in Japan. It is not easy to determine the cause of a food poisoning outbreak from the shape or chemical composition when the available sample is small. Therefore, we developed a new primer pair for PCR to identify kuwazuimo and shimakuwazuimo in small samples, based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA. Using PCR with the developed primer pair, we detected all samples of kuwazuimo obtained from the market, while excluding 17 other kinds of crops. The samples were identified as shimakuwazuimo by DNA sequencing of the PCR products. The present PCR method showed high specificity and was confirmed to be applicable to the identification of kuwazuimo and shimakuwazuimo from various crops.","183":"Two yellow dyes, together with tartrazine (Y4), were found in cucumbers pickled in soy sauce, for which the use of tartrazine is permitted, by TLC, LC-DAD, and LC-MS. The retention times on LC chromatograms and the maximum absorbance wavelengths measured by LC-DAD of the two dyes were different from those of tartrazine. Mass spectra of the dyes indicated that these dyes lacked one sulfonyl group of tartrazine. The presence of two less sulfonated dyes in tartrazine has been reported. Hence, the two less sulfonated dyes were synthesized. The two dyes found in cucumbers were compared with the synthesized dyes by LC-DAD and LC-MS. Since the retention times of the dyes in cucumbers on the LC chromatograms, as well as their LC-DAD spectra and mass spectra, were found to be identical with those of the synthesized dyes, we concluded these dyes are the less sulfonated subsidiary dyes of tartrazine.","184":"","185":"","186":"The Japanese Food Sanitation Law sets a limit on the migration level of caprolactam for food-contacting nylon products. Here, we carried out an interlaboratory study in twenty laboratories to evaluate the performance of the official GC-FID test method and a GC-MS method as an alternative test method to the official method. Each laboratory quantified caprolactam in three test solutions in 20% ethanol as blind duplicates using GC-FID or GC-MS. The official method (GC-FID with absolute calibration) gave trueness, repeatability (RSDr) and reproducibility (RSDr) values of 96-97%, 3.3-5.4% and 4.0-6.7%, respectively. These values met the target criteria (trueness: 80-110%, RSDr: 10%, RSDr: 25%). The performance of the method was further improved by the introduction of heptalactam as an internal standard. As for GC-MS method, some values of the RSDr exceeded 10% when absolute calibration was used. However, when an internal standard was introduced, the trueness, RSDr and RSDr of GC-MS method were all acceptable at 94-96%, 2.0-4.4% and 7.0-9.4%, respectively. Therefore, GC-MS with an internal standard is available as an alternative test method to the official method.","187":null,"188":"The effect of pH of the clean-up process in the analysis of 11 permitted tar dyes in high protein food was investigated by using a handmade polyamide column (PA column) and Oasis HLB.

At pH 3.0-5.5, precipitate formed in the extract clogged the column, and the recoveries of R3, R104 and R105 were 26-68%. At pH 6.0-7.0, clogging was not observed and the recoveries of the 3 dyes were somewhat higher, at 38-79%. The recoveries of other dyes were more than 80% at pH 3.0-7.0. With Oasis HLB, column loading was conducted at pH 11.0, and the recoveries of the 3 dyes improved to 70-83%. In conclusion, all 11 dyes could be cleaned-up with the PA column and Oasis HLB and the recoveries exceeded 70%.","189":"A method for the determination of diphenylamine in agricultural products was developed. Diphenylamine was extracted with acetonitrile from a sample under an acidic condition, passed through a C18 cartridge column, re-extracted with n-hexane, cleaned up on a PSA cartridge column, determined by HPLC with fluorescence detector and confirmed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Average recoveries (n=5) from brown rice, corn, soybeans, potato, cabbage, eggplant, spinach, orange, apple and green tea were in the range from 76.7 to 94.9%, and the relative standard deviations were from 0.6 to 5.8% at concentrations equal to the maximum residue limits (MRLs). The quantification limits were 0.01 mg\/kg, which is the uniform limit in the positive list system for agricultural chemical residues in food in Japan.","190":"Lac dye and cochineal extract contain laccaic acids and carminic acid as the main pigments, respectively. Both laccaic acids and carminic acid are anthraquinone derivatives. 4-Aminocarminic acid (acid-stable carmine), an illegal colorant, has been detected in several processed foods. 4-Aminocarminic acid is obtained by heating cochineal extract (carminic acid) in ammonia solution. We attempted to prepare ammonia-treated lac dye and to identify the structures of the main pigment components. Ammonia-treated lac dye showed acid stability similar to that of 4-aminocarminic acid. The structures of the main pigments in ammonia-treated lac dye were analyzed using LC\/MS. One of the main pigments was isolated and identified as 4-aminolaccaic acid C using various NMR techniques, including 2D-INADEQUATE. These results indicated that ammonia-treatment of lac dye results in the generation of 4-aminolaccaic acids.","191":"A real-time PCR-based analytical method was developed for the event-specific quantification of a genetically modified (GM) soybean event, MON87701. First, a standard plasmid for MON87701 quantification was constructed. The conversion factor (Cf) required to calculate the amount of genetically modified organism (GMO) was experimentally determined for a real-time PCR instrument. The determined Cf for the real-time PCR instrument was 1.24. For the evaluation of the developed method, a blind test was carried out in an inter-laboratory trial. The trueness and precision were evaluated as the bias and reproducibility of relative standard deviation (RSDr), respectively. The determined biases and the RSDr values were less than 30 and 13%, respectively, at all evaluated concentrations. The limit of quantitation of the method was 0.5%, and the developed method would thus be applicable for practical analyses for the detection and quantification of MON87701.","192":"","193":"Using polystyrene, acrylonitrile-styrene resin and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin pellets as samples, an interlaboratory study was performed to evaluate the volatiles test method, based on the specifications described in the Japanese Food Sanitation Law for food-contacting polystyrene products. The study was conducted with the participation of twenty-one laboratories. Each laboratory quantified the contents of styrene, toluene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene and propylbenzene in three test pellets using GC-FID, GC-MS or headspace-GC-FID. Statistical analysis revealed that the repeatability (RSDr) and reproducibility (RSDr) were 1.0-2.6 and 2.5-5.5% for the GC-FID method. The values of the performance parameters fulfilled the requirements (RSDr: 10%, RSDr: 25%), and the performance is sufficient for specifications testing. The RSDr and RSDr of results obtained using the GC-MS and HS-GC methods were 1.4-7.8 and 4.9-13%(GC-MS), and 2.0-2.6 and 3.3-6.9%(HS-GC-FID), respectively. The quantified levels were similar to those obtained with GC-FID. The study suggests that the GC-MS and HS-GC methods can be employed as alternative methods to the GC-FID method.","194":null,"195":"Discriminating vegetable oils and animal and milk fats by infrared absorption spectroscopy is difficult due to similarities in their spectral patterns. Therefore, a rapid and simple method for analyzing vegetable oils, animal fats, and milk fats using TOF\/MS with an APCI direct probe ion source was developed. This method enabled discrimination of these oils and fats based on mass spectra and detailed analyses of the ions derived from sterols, even in samples consisting of only a few milligrams. Analyses of the mass spectra of processed foods containing oils and milk fats, such as butter, cheese, and chocolate, enabled confirmation of the raw material origin based on specific ions derived from the oils and fats used to produce the final product.","196":null,"197":null,"198":"A method using high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) was developed for the identification of colorants migrated from colored modeling clays, which are popular toys for children.

However, ADA is prohibited for use as a food additive in Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an efficient and sensitive method to determine ADA in wheat flour. A simple and practical procedure to analyze ADA in wheat flour and prepared flour mixes was developed. ADA was extracted from samples by ultrasonication with acetone. ADA in the solution was derivatized with triphenylphosphine (TPP). The ADA-TPP derivative was concentrated and cleaned up using a reversed-phase solid-phase extraction cartridge, and the ADA-TPP derivative was analyzed using HPLC for determination and LC-MS\/MS for identification. Good linearity was achieved over the concentration range of 0.25-100 ppm ADA in wheat flour and prepared flour mixes.

In this study, we explored convenient analytical methods to measure free-water (3)H in foods using a liquid scintillation counting and azeotropic distillation method. The detection limit was 10 Bq\/L, corresponding to about 0.01% of 1 mSv\/year. The (3)H recoveries were 85-90% in fruits, vegetables, meats and fishes, 75-85% in rice and cereal crops, and less than 50% in sweets containing little water. We found that, in the case of sweets, adding water to the sample before the azeotropic distillation increased the recovery and precision. Then, the recoveries reached more than 75% and RSD was less than 10% in all food categories (13 kinds). Considering its sensitivity, precision and simplicity, this method is practical and useful for (3)H analysis in various foods, and should be suitable for the safety assessment of foods. In addition, we examined the level of (3)H in foods on the Japanese market. No (3)H radioactivity was detected in any of 42 analyzed foods.","206":null,"207":"A GC-MS\/MS method for determination of the rodenticide tetramethylenedisulfotetramine was developed.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with post-column derivatization and fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) were used for the analysis of TTX and PSTs, respectively. For both samples, TTX and two analogues of PSTs, saxitoxin (STX) and decarbamoyl STX (dcSTX), were detected at levels over the limit of quantization (LOQ) only in the skin. These toxins in the muscle and internal organs were at trace levels, or not detected (ND). TTX contents were 11,000 and 13,000 ng\/g (or 35 and 41 nmol\/g), while PSTs contents were 168 and 460 ng\/g (or 0.63 and 1.72 nmol\/g) in the two skin specimens. The compositions of total toxin content were 98.2 and 96.0 mol% TTX and 1.8 and 4.0 mol% PSTs, respectively. Thus, the main contributor to toxin content in C. rivulata skin was TTX and the levels of PSTs toxicity in C. rivulata were very low. When the PSTs contents were converted into mouse unit score from the LC-FLD results, the resulting values of 1.0 and 2.8 MU\/g of PSTs in C. rivulata skin were similar to those in Takifugu poecilonotus and Takifugu vermicularis in Japan, as determined in previous studies.","211":"In this experiment, 351 pesticides and 441 different organic compounds were analyzed by GC\/MS, and a database of retention time, retention index, monoisotopic mass, two selected ions, molecular formula, and CAS numbers was created.

In September 2014, contamination of boiled and dried whitebait products with pufferfish juveniles became a serious food safety concern, as tiger pufferfish Takifugu rubripes juveniles are toxic and contain tetrodotoxin (TTX). The toxicity of the juveniles of other pufferfish species, however, is unclear. To evaluate the food safety of whitebait products contaminated with pufferfish juveniles, we identified the species and toxicity of pufferfish juveniles contaminating whitebait products processed between July and September, 2014. Nucleotide sequence analysis of 16S rRNA or cytochrome b gene fragments of the mitochondrial DNA indicated that partial sequences of the polymerase chain reaction products of 15 specimens were identical with those of Lagocephalus spadiceus, and partial sequence from 2 specimens were identical with those of Takifugu vermicularis. We analyzed TTX by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. TTX was not detected in the L. spadiceus specimens and was below the quantification limits (30 ng\/g) in a T. vermicularis specimen. Based on whitebait product manufacturer's research, 795 individuals and 27.2 g of pufferfish juveniles were detected in 8,245 kg whitebait product.

We first attempted to obtain genome DNA from this maize using a DNeasy Plant Maxi kit and a DNeasy Plant Mini kit, which have been widely utilized in our previous studies, but DNA extraction yields from 3272 were markedly lower than those from non-GM maize seeds. However, lowering of DNA extraction yields was not observed with GM quicker or Genomic-tip 20\/G. We chose GM quicker for evaluation of the quantitative method. We prepared a standard plasmid for 3272 quantification. The conversion factor (Cf), which is required to calculate the amount of a genetically modified organism (GMO), was experimentally determined for two real-time PCR instruments, the Applied Biosystems 7900HT (the ABI 7900) and the Applied Biosystems 7500 (the ABI7500). The determined Cf values were 0.60 and 0.59 for the ABI 7900 and the ABI 7500, respectively. To evaluate the developed method, a blind test was conducted as part of an interlaboratory study. The trueness and precision were evaluated as the bias and reproducibility of the relative standard deviation (RSDr). The determined values were similar to those in our previous validation studies.

After performance evaluation, recovery studies were performed on 110 kinds of MW products to examine the applicability of the methods. The approximate proportion of the MW samples, in which the recovery rate of these anionic compounds was within 90 to 110%, was 95% in the cyanide ion and bromic acid analysis and 45% in the cyanogen chloride analysis. We observed low rates of recovery of cyanogen chloride from some MW products with pH values around neutral. To increase the recovery rate, we propose adding phosphoric acid buffer to adjust the pH of these MW samples. The retention times for bromic acid in some MW products differed from that in standard solution. We concluded that carbonic acid influences the retention times.

Results of (90)Sr analyses indicated that (90)Sr was detect in 25 of the 40 radioactive cesium (r-Cs) positive samples collected in areas around the Fukushima Daiichi NPP, ranging in distance from 50 to 250 km. R-Cs positive samples were defined as containing both (134)Cs and (137)Cs which are considered to be indicators of the after-effects of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident. We also detected (90)Sr in 8 of 13 r-Cs negative samples, in which (134)Cs was not detected. Strontium-90 concentrations in the r-Cs positive samples did not significantly exceed the (90)Sr concentrations in r-Cs negative samples or the (90)Sr concentration ranges in comparable food groups found in previous surveys before the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident. Thus, (90)Sr concentrations in r-Cs positive samples were indistinguishable from the background (90)Sr concentrations arising from global fallout prior to the Fukushima accident, suggesting that no marked increase of (90)Sr concentrations has occurred in r-Cs positive samples as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident.

However, it is unclear whether these is a causative relation. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated whether glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate enhanced the anticoagulant action of warfarin in mice in vivo, focusing on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYPs)-mediated mechanisms. Mice were fed a diet containing various doses of glucosamine or chondroitin sulfate (0, 0.3, 1% (w\/w)) for 2 weeks, and given warfarin by gavage on the last 2 days of the treatment regimen. Doses of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were 443 mg\/kg and 464 mg\/kg in the 0.3% diet groups, and 1523 mg\/kg and 1546 mg\/kg in the 1% diet groups. We found that 1% glucosamine significantly shortened prothrombin time and thrombotest Owen in animals given warfarin. However, the two ingredients did not induce or inhibit hepatic CYPs, including (S)-warfarin hydroxylase.

In this analysis, the tested strains were discriminated into 4 groups at the aflR\/J-IGS region. Although ITS-1\/2 region analysis could not discriminate between A. flavus (AF producers) and A. oryzae\/A. flavus (AF nonproducers), aflR\/J-IGS region analysis could discriminate between these groups. Moreover, 45 strains of A. flavus were compared by means of both phylogenetic tree analysis based on the aflR\/J-IGS region and the conventional aflatoxin production test (culture method). The phylogenetic tree analysis of the tested strains was consistent with the findings of the culture method. In addition, 49 strains of A. flavus and related species (Aspergillus spp.) were tested by multiplex PCR with primers designed on the basis of the phylogenetic tree analysis.

In a series of experiments on survival of EHEC on beef during cooking on an electric griddle or a gas cooktop, the population was reduced by at least 1\/1,100. Although these results suggested that EHEC are effectively killed by adequate cooking, the degree of reduction of EHEC varied among types of meat and was affected by uneven cooking. Furthermore, when the same cooking equipment was used to handle meats before and after cooking, 1\/500 to 1\/300,000 of EHEC population of contaminated uncooked meat cross-contaminated the cooked meat.

Blood glucose level was determined up to 6 h after tolbutamide administration. CFE treatment increased total CYP content and various CYP subtypes in the liver. In particular, increases in activity and protein expression were noted for the CYP2B, CYP2C, and CYP3A subtypes. CFE treatment dose-dependently attenuated both the hypoglycemic action of tolbutamide at 6 h and the plasma concentration of tolbutamide. The activity of (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylase, a CYP2C enzyme was negatively correlated with plasma tolbutamide level, which also showed a negative correlation with the reduction of blood glucose level.

Here, we investigated the reason for the differences in radioactive cesium concentration in different cuts of beef from the same cows. The concentrations of radioactive cesium in five different parts cuts of beef from three cows were negatively correlated with fat content, suggesting that the difference in radioactive cesium concentration is due to differences in fat content in the meat. In addition, our results showed that the concentration of radioactive cesium in muscle was more than 7-fold higher than that in fat in the same cow.

The toxicity of the calibrant oyster extract determined by the official testing method, mouse bioassay (MBA), was 4 MU\/g. Oyster samples collected over 3 years showed a similar toxin profile to the alternative standard, resulting in good agreement between the PSP-ELISA and the MBA. The PSP-ELISA method was better than the MBA in terms of sensitivity, indicating that it may be useful for earlier warning of contamination of oysters by PST in the distinct coastal areas. To use the PSP-ELISA as a screening method prior to MBA, we finally set a screening level at 2 MU\/g PSP-ELISA for oyster monitoring in Kumamoto prefecture.

The highest yield of DNA was obtained with Genomic-tip 20\/G. The degree of degradation of extracted DNA was observed to increase in the order of raw, frozen, canned, dry pack, and baby corn samples. To evaluate the quality of extracted DNA, real-time PCR analyses were conducted using three maize endogenous genes. The DNAs extracted using GM Quicker 3 had high purity, suggesting that GM Quicker 3 would be the most suitable method for DNA extraction from processed sweet corn products.

Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of cooking on the extent of contamination with radioactive materials in order to avoid internal exposure to radioactive materials via seafood. In this study, we investigated the changes in radioactive cesium content in pond smelt cooked in four different ways: grilled, stewed (kanroni), fried and soaked (nanbanzuke). The radioactive cesium content in grilled, kanroni and fried pond smelt was almost unchanged compared with the uncooked state. In contrast, radioactive cesium content in nanbanzuke pond smelt was decreased by about 30%. Our result suggests that soaking cooked pond smelt in seasoning is an effective method of reducing the burden radioactive cesium.

Furthermore, soaking beef in 10% salt solution for 7 days while changing the salt solution every day or every three days decreased the radioactive cesium content by about 75%, compared with that present in beef before soaking. Because the seasoning is usually discarded after soaking, the procedure of soaking beef in seasoning is a useful method of reducing the burden of radioactive cesium.

Case reports are mainly collected at three sites: public health centers, practical living information online network system(PIO-NET), and individual companies. The case reports from the three sources are not dealt with consistently. In this study, we investigated and characterized those case reports from the viewpoint of evaluating causality, using the causality association rating methods, namely, the dendritic and pointed methods, which we reported previously. Information in public health centers comprised 20 reports per year; approximately 40% were from health care providers and contained detailed medical data. PIO-NET information comprised 366 reports per year; 80% were self-reports from users, and few medical details were included. Company information covered 1,323 cases from 13 companies; more than 90% were from users and most of them were complaints. Case reports from public health centers and PIO-NET showed that the largerst number of victims were female aged &gt;60, with allergy and gastrointestinal symptoms. When these case reports from the letter two sources were examined using the causality association rating systems, most were rated as \"possible\" and only a few were rated as \"probable\". As specific case reports from different information sources were examined in this study, we were able to identify several points that should be improved in our two rating methods. However, to ensure the safety of health foods, it will be necessary to collect a large number of high-quality case reports for evaluation by a suitable causality rating method, and to integrate those evaluated case reports into a single site. ","315":"Livers from wild pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes, can be described as having a smooth frontal side and an upper-region that is attached to the hepatic portal vein. Based on this description, the liver can be divided into 10 parts (L1-5 and R1-5), and in this work, the lethal potency of each part was determined by mouse bioassay. Among the raw livers from 58 individuals, all 10 parts of 16 individuals, and some parts of 4 individuals showed mouse lethality, but no toxicity was detected in any part of the liver from 22 individuals. In the livers of 4 individuals that were partially toxic, the lethal potency of the toxic parts was less than 4 mouse units (MU)\/g, and no part showed especially high toxicity. The remaining 16 individuals were considered non-toxic based on the assay of only one part. Among 13 frozen livers, all parts of 9 individuals were toxic, while all parts of 4 individuals were non-toxic. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that all parts of a weakly toxic raw liver and a strongly toxic frozen liver had tetrodotoxin as the major toxin. Regarding the 16 raw and 9 frozen livers, whose parts were all toxic, the relative lethal potency of each part to the mean lethal potency of the individual (8.9-709 MU\/g) was calculated, and subjected to a two-way analysis of variance with 2 factors (left\/right and top\/bottom) for each group of livers (raw or frozen). The analysis indicated non-significance among factors and interactions at a significance level of 5% in the frozen livers. However, in the raw livers, although no interaction between the 2 factors was detected, the right-side and the 4th-portion from the top were significantly higher than the left-side and the other portions, respectively. Therefore, we concluded that individual inspection using R4, which is the region that lies below the right-center location of the liver, is suitable for toxicity evaluation of liver to ensure the safe consumption of pufferfish.

Twenty-two kinds of pesticides, including organophosphorus, organochlorine, pyrethroid and others, were detected at levels between trace (below 0.01 ppm) and 4.0 ppm in 76 samples. The rate of detection was 90% in non-fermented tea, 89% in semi-fermented tea, and 49% in fermented tea. Organophosphorus pesticide was not detected in puer tea, which is fermented with bacteria. The pesticide residues tended to be decreased by a fermentation process. However, organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticides appeared to be chemically stable, so they were still detected in fermented teas. Residue levels of these pesticides were calculated as less than 1% of ADI, except for ethion (45% of ADI) based on the daily intake of tea. Therefore, these teas should be safe when drunk in customary amounts.

The importance of the monitoring was increased by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in March 2011. Here, the detection rates and concentrations of radioactive substances were compared among food samples collected before and after the accident in Fukushima prefecture. Before the accident, (137)Cs was the only radioactive substance detected in foods. The detection rate was 70% for fish and shellfish samples and the highest concentration was 1.7 Bq\/kg. It was also 83% for fresh mushroom samples and the highest concentration was 7.5 Bq\/kg. In contrast, the detection rate was low for vegetables and the concentrations were also lower than those of the above samples.

The concentrations of both radio-nuclides in agricultural products were much lower than the levels in groundwaters, and did not appear to be related to local geology or habitat. Freshwater fish showed higher levels than agricultural products, though the levels were lower than those in groundwaters. Unexpectedly, wild mushrooms (but not cultivated mushrooms) showed relatively high levels of Bi-214, though their levels of Pb-214 were undetectable.

Black cohosh increased the liver weight, total CYP content and CYP activities (2B and 3A) in a dose-dependent manner (up to 4.5%). Salacia inhibited CYP1A2 activity in liver microsomes in vitro. Also, salacia at the dietary dose of 4.5% suppressed body weight gain, decreased hepatic total CYP content and increased CYP activities (1A1, 2B and 2C).

Among 30 chocolate samples, cadmium was detected in 21 samples, and the level ranged from 0.025 to 0.54 mg\/kg.","366":null,"367":"","368":null,"369":"In order to reduce the health risk associated with food poisonings caused by natural toxins, it is necessary to implement risk management strategies based on previous poisoning data and risk factors. In present study, we statistically analyzed natural toxin food poisoning (NTFP) data published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare from 1989 to 2010 in Japan and reviewed the trends of NTFP for each natural toxin hazard. Since 1989, the number of incidents of NTFP in each year has not been reduced. Prevention and control are needed to reduce the risk of NTFP. The major site for all hazards was \"at home\". This result suggested that consumer education is critically important to inform about NTFP occurrence, preventive measures and emergency treatments. Furthermore, countermeasures for NTFPs which have never occurred in the past in Japan should be considered, because of the increasing variety of imported foods and changes resulting from the inerease of sea temperature with global warming.","370":null,"371":null,"372":"Food poisoning due to ingestion of a puffer fish occurred in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, in October 2008, causing neurotoxic symptoms similar to those of tetrodotoxin (TTX) poisoning. In the present study, we identified the species, toxicity, and toxins using the remaining samples of the causative puffer fish. The puffer fish was identified as smooth-backed blowfish Lagocephalus inermis by nucleotide sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and cytochrome b gene fragments of muscle mitochondrial DNA. The residual liver sample showed toxicity as high as 1,230 mouse unit (MU)\/g by bioassay and TTX was detected by liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry analysis. We therefore concluded that the food poisoning was due to TTX caused by consumption of the toxic liver of L. inermis. This is the first report that the liver of L. inermis caught in Japanese waters is strongly toxic, with levels exceeding 1,000 MU\/g. In this context, we re-examined the toxicity of L. inermis collected off the coast of Japan. Of 13 specimens assayed, 12 were toxic, although the toxicity varied markedly among individuals and tissues. Because the intestine and ovary of L. inermis have been considered non-toxic, it is particularly noteworthy that these organs were determined to be toxic, with a maximum toxicity of 43.6 MU\/g and 10.0 MU\/g, respectively. Furthermore, kidney, gallbladder, and spleen, whose toxicity has been unknown, were frequently found to be weakly toxic with levels ranging from 10 to 99 MU\/g. Therefore, further study is needed to re-examine the toxicity of smooth-backed blowfish L. inermis in the coastal waters of Japan.","373":null,"374":null,"375":"The aluminium (Al) content of 105 samples, including bakery products made with baking powder, agricultural products and seafoods treated with alum, was investigated. The amounts of Al detected were as follows (limit of quantification: 0.01 mg\/g): 0.01-0.37 mg\/g in 26 of 57 bakery products, 0.22-0.57 mg\/g in 3 of 6 powder mixes, 0.01-0.05 mg\/g in all three agricultural products examined, 0.03-0.90 mg\/g in 4 of 6 seafood samples, 0.01-0.03 mg\/g in 3 of 11 samples of instant noodles, 0.04-0.14 mg\/g in 3 of 4 samples of vermicelli, 0.01 mg\/g in 1 of 16 soybean products, but none in soybeans. Amounts equivalent to the PTWI of a 16 kg infant were detected in two samples of bakery products, two samples of powder mixes and one sample of salted jellyfish, if each sample was taken once a week. These results suggest that certain foods, depending on the product and the intake, might exceed the PTWI of children, especially infants.","376":null,"377":null,"378":"Several DNA extraction methods have been officially introduced to detect genetically modified soybeans, but the choice of DNA extraction kits depend on the nature of the samples, such as grains or processed foods. To overcome this disadvantage, we examined whether the GM quicker kit is available for both grains and processed foods. We compared GM quicker with four approved DNA extraction kits in respect of DNA purity, copy numbers of lectin gene, and working time. We found that the DNA quality of GM quicker was superior to that of the other kits for grains, and the procedure was faster. However, in the case of processed foods, GM quicker was not superior to the other kits. We therefore investigated an unapproved GM quicker 3 kit, which is available for DNA extraction from processed foods, such as tofu and boiled soybeans. The GM quicker 3 kit provided good DNA quality from both grains and processed foods, so we made a minor modification of the GM quicker-based protocol that was suitable for processed foods, using GM quicker and its reagents. The modified method enhanced the performance of GM quicker with processed foods. We believe that GM quicker with the modified protocol is an excellent tool to obtain high-quality DNA from grains and processed foods for detection of genetically modified soybeans.","379":null,"380":null,"381":"Plasticizers in 101 samples of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) toys on the Japanese market were surveyed. No phthalates were detected in designated toys, though bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, diisononyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, diisodecyl phthalate and benzyl butyl phthalate were detected in more than half of other toys. 2,2,4-Tributyl-1,3-pentanediol diisobutylate, o-acetyl tributyl citrate, adipates and diacetyl lauroyl glycerol, which are alternative plasticizers to phthalates, were detected. The results of structural analysis confirmed the presence of di(2-ethylhexyl)terephthalate, tributyl citrate, diisononyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate and neopentyl glycol esters; these have not previonsly been reported in Japan. There appears to be a shift in plasticizers used for designated toys from phthalates to new plasticizers, and the number of different plasticizers is increasing.","382":"The components of commercial sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL), purchased in Japan, were determined and identified using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Stearoyl lactate (SL) and stearoyl-2-lactylate (SLL) were purified using TLC and silica gel chromatography to obtain standards. The results show that SSL consisted of lactic acid (8.4%), stearic acid (15%), SL (57%), and SLL (13%). The total amounts of free lactic acid, lactic acid derived from SL and lactic acid derived from SLL were determined using LC-MS. The mean value was approximately equal to that determined using the JECFA method. This is the first study to determine and identify the components of SSL purchased in Japan, using TLC and LC-MS.","383":"Although the difference in allergenicity between landlocked and anadromous salmon is little understood, only anadromous salmon are recommended to be labeled in the current allergen labeling system. This study was designed to examine the allergenic potency of landlocked species (yamame) and anadromous species (sakuramasu) of masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou masou, with special reference to parvalbumin, a known major fish allergen. Analysis of the heated extracts by SDS-PAGE suggested that yamame contains parvalbumin in the muscle at considerably higher levels, as compared with sakuramasu. In accordance with this, the parvalbumin content in the muscle of yamame (1.8-7.8 mg\/g), determined by visible-light ELISA, was significantly higher than that of sakuramasu (0.28-0.52 mg\/g). Furthermore, fluorescence ELISA experiments showed that the heated extract from yamame reacts with serum from fish-allergic patients more strongly than that from sakuramasu. Three parvalbumin isoforms (PA-I, -II and -III) were individually purified from yamame and sakuramasu by gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. Based on the retention times in reverse-phase HPLC and the molecular weights estimated by MALDI\/TOF-MS, PA-I, -II and -III from yamame were judged to be identical with PA-I, -II and -III from sakuramasu, respectively. Taken together, our data indicate that landlocked masu salmon (yamame) is more allergenic than anadromous salmon (sakuramasu).","384":"We examined two unknown red dyes (designated as red dyes \"A\" and \"B\") from a dried strawberry package with a label that indicated the presence of food red No. 40 (R40). Red dye \"A\" was identified as trisodium 3-hydroxy-4-[(2'-methoxy-5'-methyl-4'-sulfonatophenyl)azo]-2,7-naphthalenedisulfonate (CSA-R) by HPLC, UV-VIS spectra and MS spectra. This compound is one of the four reported subsidiary colors of R40. Detailed analyses of red dye \"B\" by MS and NMR demonstrated that its structure was disodium 3-hydroxy-4-[(2'-methoxy-5'-methyl-4'-sulfonatophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenesulfonate. Red dye \"B\" is a structural isomer of R40, that has not been reported previously. Our results suggest that the two minor red dyes were subsidiary colors contained in R40, which had been added to the dried strawberries.","385":null,"386":"We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of an immunochromatography kit, Single-path Emetic Tox Mrk (Merck), which targets a marker protein for the detection of Bacillus cereus that produces emetic toxin. Strains were isolated after outbreaks of food poisoning, and from retail prepared foods and food products. The strains were examined for the presence of the emetic toxin-synthetase gene by PCR. All 58 emetic strains isolated from the food poisoning cases showed a positive reaction in the immunochromatography kit. No emetic strains gave false negative result. Among 47 non-emetic strains, only two strains isolated from the food poisonings and one strain isolated from food products showed a false positive reaction in the test. We concluded that this method has high sensitivity and specificity. The test can be used for detection of emetic toxin-producing B. cereus not only from food poisoning cases, but also in food products.","387":"A analytical method for simultaneous determination of 10 heterocyclic amines (HCAs) applicable to prepared foods on the market was studied. HCAs were extracted with acidic methanol, and then purified on a diatomaceous column and an ion-exchange column prior to LC-MS\/MS. The method was validated within laboratory using three groups among the total diet samples (oils and fats, fish and shellfish, meat and eggs). The method showed good precision and trueness (as recovery) in duplicate analyses over 5 days, though there were some unsatisfactory results. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the method were estimated from the deviation of the analytical results in samples spiked at a level of near 1 ng\/g. In addition,13 groups of total diet samples, 27 items of retail food ready to eat and a few foods cooked in the laboratory were analyzed using this validated method. The results showed that the method is applicable to the foods tested in this study and provided information on the content of HCAs in some foods in Japan.","388":"The applicability of liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) for determining pesticide residues in agricultural products was investigated. TOF-MS conditions for monitoring target ions, together with their fragment ions, were carefully optimized. The developed LC-TOF-MS method was evaluated for 154 pesticides in soybean and spinach by using matrix-matched standards. No significant matrix effect was observed for most of the tested pesticides at a concentration level of 0.01 mg\/kg, where the limits of quantification were less than 0.01 mg\/kg for 145 of the 154 pesticides (S\/N&gt;10). In addition, no significant interference was observed in the chromatograms of the blank extracts. These results indicate that LC-TOF-MS determination may become a powerful tool for multi-residue analysis of pesticides in agricultural products.","389":"The performance characteristics of an analytical method for cyanogenic compounds were evaluated. Specifically, we tested the trueness, repeatability and intermediate precision of the method using a spectrophotometric-based detection system for 4-pyridinecarboxylic acid and pyrazolone after steam distillation. The pH adjustment of the distillate was revealed to affect the trueness of the measurements. A pH of approximately 6 was found to be optimal. The targeted quantitation limit of the cyanide ion was set to 5 mg\/kg. The performance of the method was evaluated using beans spiked with cyanide ion at one to two times the quantitation limit (5-10 mg\/kg). The trueness of the method was between 78-90%, and the repeatability and intermediate precision were between RSD 1.2% to 6.0%. A surveillance of cyanogenic compounds in beans retailed in Japan was then carried out. All the results were below the quantitation limit of 5 mg\/kg.","390":null,"391":"Overseas and imported mineral waters were subjected to visual examination, tested for standard plate count and heterotrophic bacteria, and also analyzed to determine the concentrations of several anions and cations. Some products showed turbidity or color, and several had standard plate count and\/or heterotrophic bacteria. One imported natural mineral water product had a high level of standard plate count, and the levels differed with the lot. Tests for total coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, fecal streptococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were negative on additional testing of samples having standard plate counts of more than 100. The fluoride concentration of one European region sample exceeded the production standard of the Food Sanitation Act in Japan (raw water: less than 2 mg\/L) and most of the products lacked the warning labels which are mandatory for fluoride concentrations over 0.8 mg\/L. These results indicate that none of the raw water for mineral waters was seriously polluted, but insufficient sterilization of the bottle or cap or contamination with air-borne microbes during the production process was probably responsible for the pollution. Attention needs to be paid to fair labeling, such as no sterilization\/no sterile filtration and high fluoride concentration.","392":"A method for identification of fish species using three different mitochondrial DNA regions, 16S rRNA, cytochrome b and cytochrome c gene fragments, was investigated. The combined use of all three regions enabled reliable species identification in not only raw fish, but also dried, seasoned and boiled fish, products. Furthermore, the method was applicable even to vomitus from a patient involved in a puffer fish poisoning incident. However, further improvement is necessary to discriminate between closely related species such as Takifugu rubripes and T. chinensis, because they showed close similarity in the nucleotide sequences in the three gene fragments analyzed in this study.","393":null,"394":"A rapid and simultaneous method by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was developed for determination of 19 elements in infant formula. Fast and efficient sample digestion was achieved by a microwave-assisted nitric acid procedure. An acetic acid was added to both these treated solutions and standard solutions as a countermeasure for carbon charge transfer in As, Se elements. The observed calibration curves showed good linearity (r(2)&gt;0.9993) and the quantification limit was low. The recoveries of elements were 95.0-108% and the relative standard deviations (RSD) of this method were 0.3-4.2%. The analyzed values were in good agreement with the certified values in a NIST standard reference material. This study showed that the ICP-MS method is useful for major to trace multi-elemental determination in infant formula.","395":null,"396":null,"397":"We have investigated the control of halophilic histamine-producing bacteria, Photobacterium phosphoerum and Photobacterium damselae by using vapor of essential oils and other agents. Three of fourteen essential oils showed high antibacterial activity against histamine-producing bacteria. Among food additives and detergents, ten of twenty-one food additives and seven of nine detergents also showed antibacterial activity. Low concentrations of sodium chloride suppressed the growth of both species. We examined the resistance of these bacteria to dryness on food contact surfaces. After 0.5 hours, no viable cells were detected. So, the bacteria were sensitive to dry conditions. These results should contribute to development of the techniques to prevent histamine food poisoning.","398":"A test method for 6 phthalates, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, diisononyl phthalate, diisodecyl phthalate and di-n-octyl phthalate, in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was developed. GC\/MS was used in the SIM mode for the separation and detection of phthalates. For preparation of the test solution, the extraction method with acetone-hexane mixture (3 : 7) and the dissolution method with tetrahydrofuran and ethanol were compared and it was confirmed that each method gave good recoveries. Dilution of the test solution was effective to reduce the influence of PVC. In a collaborative study with nine laboratories, the intra-laboratory variations showed good repeatability, but the measurements at some laboratories deviated widely. It appears that this method is unsuitable for the judgment of acceptability, but it may be suitable for the determination of phthalate content in PVC products.","399":null,"400":null,"401":null,"402":null,"403":null,"404":null,"405":"The aim of this study is to examine whether various essential oils, food additives, peracetic acid and detergents inhibit bacterial histidine decarboxylase. Crude extract of Morganella morganii NBRC3848 was prepared and incubated with various agents. Histidine decarboxylase activity was significantly inhibited (p&lt;0.05) by 26 of 45 compounds tested. Among the 26 agents, sodium hypochlorite completely decomposed both histidine and histamine, while peracetic acid caused slight decomposition. Histidine and histamine were stable in the presence of the other 24 agents. These results indicated that 25 of the agents examined were inhibitors of histidine decarboxylase.","406":"To reduce the cost and time required to routinely perform the genetically modified organism (GMO) test, we developed a duplex quantitative real-time PCR method for a screening analysis simultaneously targeting an event-specific segment for GA21 and Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter (P35S) segment [Oguchi et al., J. Food Hyg. Soc. Japan, 50, 117-125 (2009)]. To confirm the validity of the method, an interlaboratory collaborative study was conducted. In the collaborative study, conversion factors (Cfs), which are required to calculate the GMO amount (%), were first determined for two real-time PCR instruments, the ABI PRISM 7900HT and the ABI PRISM 7500. A blind test was then conducted. The limit of quantitation for both GA21 and P35S was estimated to be 0.5% or less. The trueness and precision were evaluated as the bias and reproducibility of the relative standard deviation (RSD(R)). The determined bias and RSD(R) were each less than 25%. We believe the developed method would be useful for the practical screening analysis of GM maize.","407":"Mulberry bark extract, a natural food additive, is described as a \"root bark extract from Morus bombycis\" (Japanese name: Yamaguwa) in the Notice (1996) relating to existing food additives used in Japan. The results of analyses by LC\/UV and LC\/MS suggested that the Mulberry bark extract products that were tested were actually made from the root bark of Morus alba (Japanese name: Maguwa) or its hybrid species, because the compositions of the constituents in the products are more similar to those in the extracts of the dried root bark of M. alba and hybrid species that are cultivated in Japan than to those of M. bombycis. In addition, the constituents of the food additive products were different from those of the natural medicine Mori Cortex products ('Souhakuhi' in Japanese) made from the root bark of mulberry grown in China, and which is described as being derived from M. alba in the Japanese pharmacopoeia. These results were also corroborated by Principal Component Analysis using the peak areas of LC\/MS analysis as explanatory variables. After this study, it was decided that Mulberry bark extract is one of the existing food additives that should be excluded from the list this year in Japan.","408":null,"409":"A sensitive and selective method for the determination of 4-hydroxycoumarin-type rodenticides (warfarin, coumatetralyl, bromadiolone, and brodifacoum) in animal products, fishery products, and honey was developed. 4-Hydroxycoumarin rodenticides were extracted with acidified acetone, and the crude extract was purified by liquid-liquid partitioning followed by PSA column cleanup. Gradient liquid chromatographic separation was performed by using an Inertsil ODS-4 column, with methanol and water containing ammonium acetate as the mobile phase. Detection was carried out on a tandem mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization in the negative mode. Average recoveries from bovine muscle, bovine liver, bovine fat, swine muscle, salmon, eel, freshwater clam, egg, milk, and honey spiked at 0.0005-0.001 mg\/kg were in the range of 79-108%, and the relative standard deviations were 2-8%.

Pesticides were extracted from a sample with ethyl acetate in the presence of anhydrous sodium sulfate, then cleaned up with a combination of mini-columns, such as macroporous diatomaceous earth, C18, GCB (graphite carbon black) and PSA. Recovery tests of 57 pesticides (known to be toxic or harmful) from ten kinds of processed foods (butter, cheese, corned beef, dried shrimp, frozen Chinese dumplings, grilled eels, instant noodles, kimchi, retort-packed curry and wine) were performed, and the recovery rates were mostly between 70% and 120%. This method can be used to judge whether or not processed foods are contaminated with pesticides at potentially harmful levels.","412":null,"413":"","414":"DNA barcoding is a species identification technique, which uses a very short DNA sequence from a region of approximately 650 base-pairs in the 5'-end of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene as a marker to identify species of mammals and fishes. The applicability of DNA barcoding for identification of fish species consumed in Japan was studied. Among thirty-one fresh or processed fishes were obtained from the market, two samples could not be identified due to lack of data in the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) database. However, BLAST-search of 16S rRNA genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and the PCR-RFLP method published by the Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center (FAMIC) were found to be applicable to identify these 2 fishes. The results show that the DNA barcoding technique is potentially useful as a tool for confirming the proper labeling of fish species in the Japanese market.","415":"A simple and practical method was developed for the determination of histamine in fish and fish products by solid-phase extraction and fluorescence derivatization. Histamine was extracted with trichloroacetic acid. The extract was neutralized and diluted with phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and cleaned up with a tandem-connected octadecyl silica (ODS) and strong cation exchange silica (SCX) cartridge. After removal of the solvent, histamine was derivatized with fluorescamine and analyzed by ion-paired reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Recovery tests of histamine from six kinds of fish and fish products showed acceptable recovery (83-92%) with low relative standard deviation (less than 5%). This method could be useful for determination of histamine in fish.","416":"Midgut glands of bivalves are used for the mouse bioassay of diarrhetic shellfish poison (DSP). A large quantity of free fatty acids (FFAs) causes a false positive outcome in the assay. To examine whether this is likely to occus under conditions of actual use, we analyzed the contents of the FFAs in the enlarged midgut glands during gametogenesis of Japanese scallops Patinopecten yessoensis that had been caught at two points in Hunka Bay on March 27, 2006, because the content of FFAs may increase with activation of lipogenesis for gametogenesis. Fatty acids (FAs) were measured with fluorometric high-performance liquid chromatography after derivatization with 9-anthryldiazomethane. The total FFAs (14 : 0, 16 : 0, 18 : 0, 16 : 1, 18 : 1, 18 : 4, 20 : 5 and 22 : 6) represented 3.3-4.2 wt% of the lipid. The toxic FFAs accounted for 40-43 wt% of the total FFAs. Content of each FFA (18 : 1, 2.7-5.0 mg\/g lipid; 18 : 4, tr.-2.0 mg\/g; 20 : 4, n.d.; 20 : 5, 8.0-9.1 mg\/g and 22 : 6, 2.0-2.1 mg\/g) was lower than the lethal dose tentatively calculated from the relative toxicity. It appears that the likelihood of FFAs causing false-positives in the mouse bioassay is low if the sample is fresh and is extracted immediately after homogenizing.","417":"Fucoxanthin-containing oil extracted from microalga, Chaetoseros sp., was subjected to genotoxicity studies, the bacterial reverse mutation test and the micronucleus test in mice. The number of revertant colonies in fucoxanthin oil-treated plates of all strains tested was less than twice the number of colonies in the negative control, regardless of the presence of the metabolic activator in the bacterial reverse mutation test. In the micronucleus test, 500, 1,000, 2,000 mg\/kg body weight of fucoxanthin oil was administered orally to mice. There was no significant increase in micronucleus frequency in bone marrow cells. These results suggest that fucoxanthin oil does not exhibit genotoxicity.","418":"Single oral dose and 13-week oral subchronic toxicity studies of fucoxanthin-containing oil extracted from microalga, Chaetoseros sp., were conducted in rats. In the single oral dose study, no mortality and no change related to the test material were observed. Thus, the 50% lethal dose of microalgal fucoxanthin oil is more than 2,000 mg\/kg body weight. In the 13-week oral dose study, 0, 20 or 200 mg\/kg body weight of microalgal fucoxanthin oil was administered. The fucoxanthin-administered groups, showed no mortality and no abnormalities. This result suggested that the no-observed-adverse-effect level of fucoxanthin-containing oil extracted from microalga Chaetoseros sp. was 200 mg\/kg body weight under the tested subchronic dose condition.","419":null,"420":"In Japan, discussions on the regulation and labeling of trans-fat (TF) have under way for several years in the Food Safety Commission and the Consumer Affairs Agency. However, administrative measures for TF have not yet been taken, partly because of the insufficiency of scientific data in Japan. To provide data about the TF intake by Japanese, we determined the levels of TF contained in total diet samples and in food samples that were served as individual meals (one-serving samples). We analyzed 5 groups of total diet samples prepared in 11 regions throughout Japan, and 5 categories of one-serving samples using the GC-method after verifying its performance. The estimated daily intake of TF based on the analytical results of the total diet samples was around 500 mg and no significant difference was observed in the intake of the TF among the 11 surveyed regions. On the other hand, many one-serving samples classified into \"hamburger\", \"pizza\" and \"Western food\" categories contained more than 500 mg of TF per serving, the standard value in the labeling regulation in the United States. If these one-serving meals are taken to represent one meal out of 3 in a day, the intake of TF can easily be expected to exceed the daily intake estimated through the analysis of the total diet samples.","421":null,"422":"A method for the determination of clofencet in animal and fishery products was developed, using liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC\/ESI-MS). The sample was homogenized with water and hexane, and the homogenate was extracted with acetonitrile, then acetonitrile-water (4 : 1). An aliquot of the crude extract was passed through a C18 cartridge column (1,000 mg), and the eluate was concentrated. A solution of 10% sodium chloride and 1% sodium hydrogen carbonate, and ethyl acetate were added to the residue, and the mixture was shaken. After shaking, the aqueous phase was recovered and acidified with hydrochloric acid, and then clofencet was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in methanol-water (3 : 7). Clofencet was analyzed by LC\/MS. The recoveries of clofencet from ten kinds of animal and fishery products were 77.8-97.8%, and the relative standard deviations were 0.6-5.8% (n=5).

The official method for quantification of CO has a problem, in that a part of the CO is lost during the preparation of the fish sample. To solve this problem, we modified the official method in this study. We also applied this modified method to survey the contents of CO in tuna, yellowtail, young yellowtail, and tilapia. As a result, the modified method was found to be more suitable for CO quantification than the official method. An inter-laboratory study by 4 laboratories confirmed that the CO content of many samples of tilapia exceeded the regulation value, apparently due to the higher recovery of CO, compared to the official method. Therefore, it was suggested that the regulation value in the case of tilapia should be changed if this method is introduced as an official method.","426":"A survey of pesticide residues in 595 imported frozen products on the Tokyo market from April 1989 to March 2008 was carried out. Forty three kinds of pesticides, including organophosphorus, organochlorine, carbamate, pyrethroid and others, were detected between levels of trace (below 0.01 ppm) and 4.6 ppm from 162 samples. Chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin and omethoate were frequently detected in green vegetables (komatsuna leaf and spinach), cypermethrin and methamidophos were detected in pods and seeds (green soybean and string pea), chlorpropham (CIPC) was detected in potato, and captan and carbaryl were detected in berries (blueberry, raspberry and strawberry). The hydrophilic pesticide methamidophos was detected in flesh of lychee. Residue levels of these pesticides were calculated as between less than 0.5% and 30% of their ADI values according to the daily intake of frozen products. Therefore, these frozen products should be safe when they were eaten in customary amounts.","427":null,"428":null,"429":"We examined the content protection characteristics of the PID (Pouch in Dispenser) when it was used in the usual manner and when it was polluted artificially. When the PID was used in the usual manner, the nozzle was opened, and experiments were carried out with and without air-blowing. The invasion of bacteria into the PID was not detected. Also, no bacteria were detected in the material poured from the nozzle of the PID. When 3 strains of bacteria suspensions were intentionally smeared on the nozzle of the PID, invasion of bacteria was observed. When the PID was wiped with a dirty cloth, no invasion of bacteria into the PID was detected. It may be necessary to label the PID with the instruction that the nozzle should not be touched. The effected of changes in the water activity and pH, and the preservatives used, may also need to be considered, depending on the contents in the PID.","430":"A novel real-time PCR-based analytical method was developed for the event-specific quantification of a genetically modified (GM) soybean event; A2704-12. During the plant transformation, DNA fragments derived from pUC19 plasmid were integrated in A2704-12, and the region was found to be A2704-12 specific. The pUC19-derived DNA sequences were used as primers for the specific detection of A2704-12. We first tried to construct a standard plasmid for A2704-12 quantification using pUC19. However, non-specific signals appeared with both qualitative and quantitative PCR analyses using the specific primers with pUC19 as a template, and we then constructed a plasmid using pBR322. The conversion factor (C(f)), which is required to calculate the amount of the genetically modified organism (GMO), was experimentally determined with two real-time PCR instruments, the Applied Biosystems 7900HT and the Applied Biosystems 7500. The determined C(f) values were both 0.98. The quantitative method was evaluated by means of blind tests in multi-laboratory trials using the two real-time PCR instruments. The limit of quantitation for the method was estimated to be 0.1%. The trueness and precision were evaluated as the bias and reproducibility of relative standard deviation (RSD(R)), and the determined bias and RSD(R) values for the method were each less than 20%. These results suggest that the developed method would be suitable for practical analyses for the detection and quantification of A2704-12.","431":"","432":"Perchlorate, which may be naturally occurring or artificial in origin, inhibits iodide uptake into the thyroid gland and disturbs thyroid function. In order to investigate perchlorate contamination in foods in Japan, perchlorate levels in 28 wine samples, 20 seafood samples, 10 polished rice samples, 30 milk (include whole milk, composition modified milk, low fat milk, processed milk, milk drink) samples, 10 powdered milk samples and 10 yogurt samples were measured. Perchlorate was found in all wine, milk, powdered milk and yogurt samples tested. Perchlorate levels ranged from 0.2 ng\/g to 103 ng\/g in wine samples, from 2 ng\/g to 11 ng\/g in milk samples, from 3 ng\/g to 35 ng\/g in powdered milk samples, and from 2 ng\/g to 11 ng\/g in yogurt samples. Perchlorate levels in the seafood samples were under the LOQ (0.8 ng\/g) in 8 samples and ranged from 0.8 ng\/g to 72 ng\/g in 12 samples.

The reported method, in which monosaccharides were converted to diethyldithioacetal derivatives with ethanethiol followed by trimethylsilylation, was improved in terms of operability and reproducibility of GC\/MS analysis. The suitability of the improved diethyldithioacetal derivatization method was determined for seven thickening polysaccharides, i.e., carob bean gum, guar gum, karaya gum, gum arabic, gum ghatti, tragacanth gum and peach gum. The samples were acid-hydrolyzed to form monosaccharides. The hydrolysates were derivatized and analyzed with GC\/FID. Each sugar derivative was detected as a single peak and was well separated from others on the chromatograms. The amounts of constituent monosaccharides in thickening polysaccharides were successfully estimated. Seven polysaccharides were distinguished from each other on the basis of constituent monosaccharides. Further examination of the time period of hydrolysis of polysaccharides using peach gum showed that the optimal times were not the same for all monosaccharides. A longer time was needed to hydrolyze glucuronic acid than neutral saccharides. The findings suggest that hydrolysis time may sometimes affect the analytical results on composition of constituent monosaccharides in polysaccharides.","439":null,"440":"A method for simultaneous determination of metribuzin (MET) and three metribuzin metabolites in livestock products and seafoods by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) was developed.

In Japan, to prevent the spread of BSE through animal feed, the use of animal protein in feed has been regulated. Species-specific PCR detection of prohibited species materials in feed has been used as one of a series of laboratory tests to ensure the proper implementation of the feed regulations. However, since the result of this PCR method is determined only by amplicon length, it is sometimes necessary to confirm whether or not the positive result is due to the effect of a non-specific reaction. For this purpose, DNA sequencing is the best way to confirm the test result but it is not suitable for routine analysis because of the required time and cost. In this study, we developed an easy and rapid method to confirm the species identification (mammals, ruminants and cattle) by using 4 restriction enzymes: SmlI, MboI, BlnI and Hpy188III. This PCR-RFLP method, which ensures identification of prohibited animal species in feed, is useful for enhancing the reliability of feed inspection for BSE prevention. This method will be added to the Official Methods of Feed Analysis.","442":null,"443":"We compared test methods for measurement of lead in metal utensils using flame-atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), graphite furnace-AAS (GFAA), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP) and X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF). The procedure for preparation of the test solution was improved. A 100 mg of sample was dissolved in 2.5 mL of HCl and HNO(3) (3 : 1) mixture (in the case of titanium sample, dissolved in HCl). Stock solution was prepared by diluting to 50 mL with water. The test solution was prepared by diluting with 0.1 mol\/L HNO(3). The recoveries of lead added to various kinds of metal reagent at the level of 0.1% were 90-118%. When standard materials which contained lead at the level of 0.0098-0.11% were measured, the measured values were in close agreement with the standard values. These procedures are applicable to aluminum, iron, stainless steel, copper, tin and titanium products. The AAS method, GFAA method and ICP method were suitable as the lead test methods. Moreover, the XRF method was useful as a screening method or a simple determination method. The ICP method was used to determine the lead contents in 22 kinds of commercial metal utensils, and 0.011-0.040% of lead were detected in 6 samples.","444":"","445":"","446":"","447":"","448":"","449":"","450":"","451":"","452":"","453":"","454":"","455":"","456":"","457":"","458":"","459":"","460":"","461":"","462":"","463":"","464":"","465":"","466":"","467":"Simple chromatographic methods were applied to terpenoid resins used as gum bases.

Characteristic patterns were observed for all resins. Different samples of the same resin gave identical patterns. The TLC method is a candidate for a simple identification test for terpenoids resins. Samples were then methyl-esterified and analyzed with GC\/MS. All resins exhibited characteristic chromatograms for total ion current. Major constituents of all resins were detected. Unique constituents that can be used as indicators were found in every resin. Therefore, GC\/MS of methyl-esterified terpenoid resins is a valuable identification method.","468":null,"469":"To conduct proficiency testing for the analysis of pesticide residues in processed foods, fortified samples of retort curry and pancake were examined. In the case of retort curry, heating and mixing were necessary at the time of preparation to provide a homogenous analytical sample. A mixture of 4 carbamates and 11 organophosphorus pesticides was spiked and 14 of them showed consistent results in the samples. In the case of pancake, 10 kinds of pesticides were added to the pastry. The prepared pastry was them cooked. The relative concentrations of most of the pesticides in the pancake were not affected and all the pesticides showed consistent results in the samples.

An improved DNA purification method for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of rice in such products is necessary, since Konjak flour constituents absorb the DNA purification buffer to form a gel, and cause problems in the subsequent purification steps. Here, we present a simple preparative system for isolation of the rice and a purification method of the rice DNA from the product. The purified DNA was confirmed to be a good template for both PCR and real-time PCR.","471":"A novel real-time PCR-based analytical method was established for the event-specific quantification of a GM soybean event MON89788. The conversion factor (C(f)) which is required to calculate the GMO amount was experimentally determined. The quantitative method was evaluated by a single-laboratory analysis and a blind test in a multi-laboratory trial. The limit of quantitation for the method was estimated to be 0.1% or lower. The trueness and precision were evaluated as the bias and reproducibility of the relative standard deviation (RSD(R)), and the determined bias and RSD(R) values for the method were both less than 20%. These results suggest that the established method would be suitable for practical detection and quantification of MON89788.","472":"Norovirus (NV) RNA has rarely been detected in foods despite the use of highly sensitive methods such as RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. In the modified method (A3T method) reported previously, a bacterial culture process was introduced into the standard protocol for NV detection to remove some inhibitor(s) present in food ingredients. To confirm the efficiency of the A3T method and to examine NV contamination in bivalve molluscs, we tried to detect NV RNA in bivalve molluscs on the market and in oyster samples associated with foodborne outbreaks by using the standard method and the A3T method. NV RNAs were detected in 20 samples (18.0%) of 111 bivalve molluscs, including oysters, on the market by use of the A3T method, while only one sample (0.9%) was positive according to the standard method. NV RNA was also detected in 10 of 35 oyster samples related to foodborne outbreaks by the A3T method. Those results show that the A3T method is suitable for the detection of NV in bivalve molluscs in general laboratories.","473":null,"474":null,"475":"A highly sensitive gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method was developed for dithiocarbamates (DTCs) and milneb in foods.

The qNMR method was applied to the absolute quantitation of rutin, isoquercitrin and quercetin in natural food additives, rutin (extract), enzymatically decomposed rutin extract and quercetin, and those compounds as commercial reagents. In this study, 1,4-bis-(trimethylsilyl)benzene-d(4) (1,4-BTMSB-d(4)) whose purity was precisely evaluated on the basis of metrology, was newly used as a qNMR reference material, to be added to the sample solution as an internal standard. The contents of quercetin and quercetin glycosides were calculated from the ratio of the signal intensities of each aromatic proton at the 2' position of the three compounds (these are observed at different chemical shifts) to the eighteen protons of the six methyl groups on 1,4-BTMSB-d(4) used as a qNMR reference material. Rapid and simple qNMR method with only one step process was carried by using 1,4-BTMSB-d(4).

Pesticide residues were extracted from samples with ethyl acetate-cyclohexane (1:1) in the presence of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The extract was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in n-hexane. The lipids in the extract were removed by acetonitrile-n-hexane partitioning, following which the acetonitrile layer was cleaned up using a C(18) mini-cartridge column and a graphite carbon\/PSA silica (GCB\/PSA) mini-cartridge column. The limits of quantification of compounds in 4 processed foods were below 0.01 microg\/g. The recoveries of 292 compounds spiked at 0.1 microg\/g in 4 kinds of processed foods, and 210 to 262 pesticides showed acceptable recoveries of 70-120% with low repeatability (15%) and intermediate precision (&lt;20%) only at the 0.1 microg\/g spiked level. This method is expected to be useful for multi-residue analysis of pesticide residues in processed foods manufactured using livestock and seafoods as the main raw materials.","479":"The determination method of total arsenic (As) and the speciation method of inorganic As for non-glutinous rice reported in our preceding paper were applied to several varieties of rice under optimized experimental conditions. In the determination of total As with ICP-MS, acetic acid was added to increase the sensitivity and an internal reference method with germanium was adopted to increase the precision. The extraction temperature in the partial-digestion method with nitric acid to speciate inorganic As was raised to 100 degrees C, because extraction efficiency over 90% was obtained from glutinous rice and colored rice at this temperature. In the investigation of polished and unpolished forms of non-glutinous, glutinous, and colored rice, the amounts of total and inorganic As were 0.04-0.54 mg\/kg and 0.02-0.41 mg\/kg, respectively. The color of rice was not related to total or inorganic As content. These results indicate that the inorganic As content in commercial rice should be carefully monitored.","480":"From October to November 2004, the paralytic shellfish poison (PSP)-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamiyavanichii was observed at Harima-Nada, Seto Inland Sea at a maximum cell density of 4,960 cells\/L.

PSP of the wild cells was mainly composed of gonyautoxin (GTX) 5 (40.6-52.4 mol%) and GTX4 (15.6-24.8 mol%), showing a unique composition that was greatly different from those of the previously reported strains, or of the cultured cells, whose main toxin component was GTX3 (average 37.6 mol%). The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis collected from the same area in the same period accumulated a relatively high level of PSP (13-28 MU\/g), suggesting a risk that A. tamiyavanichii may induce high-level PSP contamination of bivalves even at a cell density as low as around 5,000 cells\/L.","481":"A technique using a direct analysis in real time (DART) ion source coupled with time of flight\/mass spectrometry (TOF\/MS) was developed to discriminate plasticizers and to screen phthalates in polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In DART-TOF\/MS analysis of 40 plasticizers, the protonated molecular ion, [M+H](+), was detected for most plasticizers, and the molecular weight could be easily predicted. In the analysis of PVC sheets and toys, mass spectra of plasticizers were successfully detected, and accordingly, plasticizers in PVC were easily discriminated. PVC with a phthalates content in excess of 0.1% could be screened accurately according to the DART-TOF\/MS ion intensity of phthalates corresponding to the limit of detection or a suitable criterion value. DART-TOF\/MS analysis is a simple and rapid technique that is suitable for the discrimination of plasticizers and for screening of phthalates in PVC.","482":"Bovine collagen is allergenic and its major IgE epitope has already been identified. Fish collagen is also allergenic but shows no IgE cross-reactivity with bovine collagen, implying that it has specific IgE epitopes. Therefore, this study was initiated to elucidate IgE epitopes of rainbow trout collagen alpha2 chain. Five overlapping proteins (R1-5; 221 or 225 amino acids long with an offset of 205 amino acids) covering the entire sequence of the rainbow trout collagen alpha2 chain were expressed in Escherichia coli. Immunoblotting experiments using 10 patients' sera reacting to fish collagen revealed that the major IgE epitope is included in the R5 protein (region 821-1,041). Then, 26 overlapping peptides (20 or 21 amino acids long with an offset of 8 amino acids) encompassing the sequence of the R5 protein were chemically synthesized and examined for IgE-binding ability by fluorescence ELISA. Region 941-960 was found to be most IgE-reactive. When evaluated by inhibition ELISA, this region accounted for more than 50% of the IgE reactivity to the R5 protein. Moreover, the same region was found to be IgE-reactive in bastard halibut and zebrafish collagen alpha2 chains, but not in bovine collagen alpha2 chain. Our results strongly suggest that region 941-960 is a major common IgE epitope of fish collagen alpha2 chains.","483":"","484":"We examined the preparation method of the calibration standard for an ELISA kit for measuring crustacean protein in food products.

Single bands at 160, 41, 37 kDa and 4 bands in the range of 16-20 kDa were observed on SDS-PAGE. The range of protein concentration of the initial extract of the calibration standard was 2.74-4.10 mg\/mL.","485":"Vulnerability of children to toxic substances is of great concern due to their susceptibility and specific exposure profiles. In this study, we examined urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) levels in 134 kindergarten children and their mothers in order to assess exposure profiles from foods. Mean concentration of 1-OHP in children (0.083 micromol\/mol-creatinine) was 1.8-fold higher than that in mothers (0.046 micromol\/mol-creatinine). Nonetheless, a significant correlation was observed between 1-OHP levels in the two groups, which presumably reflected the similarities of diet between child and mother on the day before urine sampling. Moreover, intake of foodstuff, such as meat and\/or fish, elevated the urinary 1-OHP levels, apparently due to high cooking temperature. These results demonstrate the importance of exposure assessment of toxic substances (in children via the diet).","486":"We studied the simultaneous determination of acephate, methamidophos, and omethoate in animal and fishery products, their processed foods, and honey by means of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The sample was extracted with ethyl acetate in the presence of anhydrous Na(2)SO(4) (and diatomaceous earth for honey). An aliquot of the crude sample extract was loaded into the GPC system, and the pesticide fraction was selectively collected. The extract was cleaned up on a PSA mini-column, and determined by a column-switching ESI-SIM mode LC-MS. Mean recoveries (2 replicates x 5 days) of compounds from eleven kinds of samples, except honey, fortified at the analyte concentration of 0.05 microg\/g were from 71.4% to 98.4%. The repeatability relative standard deviation values were &lt; or =12.5%, and the intermediate reproducibility relative standard deviation values were &lt; or =14.1%.

Nonvolatile amines in a solid sample were extracted with 3% trichloroacetic acid, and the amines in a liquid sample were extracted with water. The extract was applied to polymer-based strong cation exchange mini-column, which was then rinsed with phosphate buffer of pH 6.8 and water. Nonvolatile amines were eluted with 100 mmol\/L potassium carbonate solution. The solution was mixed with 6 mmol\/L 1-pyrenebutylyl chloride solution and derivatized. Derivatives of nonvolatile amines were analyzed by LC-FLD, and the identity of the amines was confirmed by LC-MS\/MS without derivatization. The limit of detection (S\/N&gt; or =3) of nonvolatile amines in all samples was 0.04 microg\/g, and the limit of quantitation (S\/N&gt; or =10) was 0.1 microg\/g.

The primers and the TaqMan MGB (minor groove binder) probes were designed based on the gene encoding cytochrome b for the specific detection of Alaska pollack, Pacific cod and capelin. This real-time PCR assay had the detection limit of 0.002 ng\/microL mitochondrial DNA and showed no cross-reaction with 48 other species. The calculated r(2) values of the standard curves for the three species were 1.000. This assay was applied for the detection of Pacific cod and capelin roes in mixture samples: Pacific cod or capelin roes were added to Alaska pollack roes at 0.1, 1 and 10%. The threshold cycle values were obtained from both of the mixture samples at 0.1%. Practical applicability of this assay was examined with 64 samples of Alaska pollack roe products. In all cases, the species detected from the samples corresponded with species described on the food label.","489":"We examined the combined estrogenic activity of soybean extract used in a dietary supplement and ethinyl estradiol (EE) contained in an oral contraceptive. Olive oil (control), soybean extract (0.0036 or 0.36 g\/kg corresponding to doses of total isoflavone of 0.83 or 83 mg\/kg respectively), EE (1 or 10 microg\/kg), and soybean extract+EE were administered to ovariectomized CD-1 mice by oral gavage for 4 consecutive days. Soybean extract (0.0036 or 0.36 g\/kg) and EE (1 microg\/kg) did not increase the relative uterine weight. The relative uterine weight of the soybean extract (0.0036 or 0.36 g\/kg)+EE (10 microg\/kg) group was significantly higher than that of the control. The relative uterine weight of the soybean extract (0.36 g\/kg)+EE (10 microg\/kg) group was also significantly higher than that of the EE (10 microg\/kg) group. Soybean extract showed estrogenic activity for human estrogen receptor (hER)-alpha and -beta. Coadministration of EE with soybean extract increased the estrogenic activity for hER-alpha and -beta.","490":"A novel multiplex PCR method was developed for simultaneous event-specific detection of four events of GM maize, i.e., DAS-59122-7, MIR604, MON88017, and MON863. The single laboratory examination of analytical performance using simulated DNA mixtures containing GM DNA at various concentrations in non-GM DNA suggested that the limits of detection (LOD) of the multiplex PCR method were 0.16% for MON863, MIR604, and MON88017, and 0.078% for DAS-59122-7. We previously developed a nonaplex (9plex) PCR method for eight events of GM maize, i.e., Bt11, Bt176, GA21, MON810, MON863, NK603, T25, and TC1507. Together with the nonaplex PCR method, the newly developed method enabled the detection and identification of eleven GM maize events that are frequently included in commercial GM seed used in Japan. In addition, this combinational analysis may be useful for the identification of combined event products of GM maize.","491":"Marine organisms contain arsenic at various concentrations, and so human consumption of seafood products results in arsenic intake. Therefore, identification and quantification of all arsenic compounds present in seafood products are important from the viewpoint of food hygiene, because the toxicity of arsenic strongly depends on its chemical form. Hence, determination of total arsenic concentration and speciation analysis of arsenic compounds in seafood products have been extensively performed. This review covers the large number of arsenic compounds identified in seafood products, and summarizes recent findings on their biological effects and metabolism in humans and experimental animals.","492":"A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method specific for genetically modified (GM) maize event DAS59132 (E32) was adapted for qualitative detection of low level presence of E32. The method was validated by a collaborative trial with eight participating Japanese laboratories. Sensitivity was assessed with three different samples of corn flour fortified to 0%, 0.05% and 0.1% (w\/w) E32 respectively. In addition, a 0.01% E32 DNA solution was used. The detection limit with DNA solution was estimated to be approximately 0.01%. In conclusion, the results of the study confirmed this real-time PCR method as a reliable tool for qualitative detection of E32 maize.","493":"A novel multi-functional adsorbent (RP-SAX adsorbent) bearing hydrophobic and anion exchange groups was synthesized for the simple and rapid determination of residual acephate (AP) in vegetables. Macroporous base resin was obtained by suspension copolymerization with glycidyl methacrylate, stearyl methacrylate and glycerin dimethacrylate, and then ethyldimethylamine was introduced at glycidyl groups on the base resin. The adsorbent was packed into a syringe-type tube and used for extraction of AP. AP in the vegetable extract was quantitatively entrapped on the adsorbent and was completely eluted with 3 mL of 30 mmol\/L trisodium phosphate in 50% (v\/v) methanol solution. The eluate was directly injected into an HPLC-UV detection system with a reverse-phased column. The recoveries of 5 mg\/L AP spiked in vegetable extraction samples ranged from 77% to 100%.","494":"A simple analytical method was developed for the determination of total bromine in fruits and grain products by means of wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF).Five gram samples of fresh fruits, frozen fruits, dried fruits and grain products were extracted with distilled water twice and diluted to 25 mL with distilled water. The sample solution (0.5 mL) was dripped onto the filter paper, which was dried and analyzed by WDXRF. The working curve was linear in the range of 0 to 10 microg\/mL. Recoveries at the level of 5 microg\/g were 76-104%. The detection limit was 0.5 microg\/g and the determination limit was 1.5 microg\/g in foods. Compared to the GC-ECD method, this method gave equivalent results for fresh fruits, frozen fruits and grain products. In addition, some dried fruits, in which a slightly high level was detected, gave almost the same results with the GC-ECD method. Therefore, this method is considered to be available as an alternative to the GC-ECD method.","495":"Changes in tetrodotoxin (TTX) content of the puffer fish Takifugu rubripes during seed production were examined. Two mature female puffer fish T. rubripes (samples 1 and 2) that contained TTX were used. The toxic eggs were artificially fertilized, and hatchlings were reared in an indoor tank for 50 days and then in a netcage at sea for an additional 48 or 38 days. The TTX content of the fertilized eggs of sample 1 was initially 13.0 microg TTX\/g, transiently increased to 67.6 microg TTX\/g at 4 days after hatching, and then gradually decreased to 0.28 microg TTX\/g at 98 days. In contrast, the total TTX content in an individual was 0.016 microg TTX at the fertilization stage and 0.01-0.03 microg TTX at the larval stage until 30 days after hatching. Thereafter, the total TTX content increased remarkably during culture in the netcage at sea, reaching 4.80 microg TTX at 98 days. Change in the TTX content of sample 2 showed a similar tendency to that of sample 1. The present study showed that the TTX content per gram of puffer fish body weight decreased during progression from fertilized eggs to juveniles, whereas the total TTX content increased.","496":"Polypropylene microtubes (tubes) are generally used for bio-material tests in addition to PCR tests such as genetically modified organism (GMO) testings. However, the choice of suitable tubes is quite important, because it might influence the results: DNA binding and\/or elution of chemical substances sometimes occurs. In this study, we established methods to select tubes with the most suitable characteristics for DNA testing.","497":"In the inspection of genetically modified rice, rice taxon-specific DNA could not be detected in processed rice food (bifun: rice vermicelli). The effects of using PCR the ratio of rice powder content and temperature of processing on the detection of taxon-specific DNA were examined by means of processing model experiments using cornstarch with 0, 2, 5, 10% rice powder by weight. Cornstarch and rice powder were blended with water and subjected to heating, steam-treatment, and autoclaving. The rice taxon-specific DNA was detectable in 2% rice powder following heat and steam treatments. After autoclaving, rice taxon-specific DNA was detected only in the 10% rice powder product. In the processing model experiment using rice powder, it was found that autoclaving caused severe DNA degradation.","498":"The Bt11 maize-specific qualitative detection method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the JAS analytical test handbook has been widely used for administrative monitoring of GM crops and quality control of commercially distributed grains. In the present investigation, some apparently false-positive detections were observed in assays using the Bt11 maize-specific method, and these erroneous results were proved to have been caused by non-specific DNA amplification. We improved the detection method to reduce non-specific amplification by decreasing the concentration of magnesium ions in the PCR mixture. The subsequent evaluation of analytical performance demonstrated no marked difference between the currently used and the improved methods, except for the reduced non-specific amplification. We conclude that the currently used standard method should be replaced with the improved method for the reliable detection of Bt11 maize.","499":"Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O-157 : H7 produces verotoxins called Shiga toxin or Shiga-like toxin. The type 1 and type 2 toxins present different immunological and physicochemical characteristics, and cause symptoms such as watery diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, severe stomach ache, fever and vomiting. The toxins can be assayed by several methods, including ELISA and PCR, with some limitations as to sensitivity. In the present study, we used a ProteoChip, which requires smaller volumes of reagents and allows detection of lower concentrations of the toxins, compared with the conventional assay.","500":"A quantitative NMR (qNMR) method was applied for the determination of carminic acid. Carminic acid is the main component in cochineal dye that is widely used as a natural food colorant. Since several manufacturers only provide reagent-grade carminic acid, there is no reference material of established purity. To improve the reliability of analytical data, we are developing quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR), based on the fact that the intensity of a given NMR resonance is directly proportional to the molar amount of that nucleus in the sample. The purities and contents of carminic acid were calculated from the ratio of the signal intensities of an aromatic proton on carminic acid to nine protons of three methyl groups on DSS-d6 used as the internal standard. The concentration of DSS-d6 itself was corrected using potassium hydrogen phthalate, which is a certified reference material (CRM). The purities of the reagents and the contents of carminic acid in cochineal dye products were determined with SI-traceability as 25.3-92.9% and 4.6-30.5% based on the crystalline formula, carminic acid potassium salt trihydrate, which has been confirmed by X-ray analysis. The qNMR method does not require a reference compound, and is rapid and simple, with an overall analysis time of only 10 min. Our approach thus represents an absolute quantitation method with SI-traceability that should be readily applicable to analysis and quality control of any natural product.","501":"The contents of nitrate and nitrite in menus containing more than 350 g of vegetables per day were investigated. The amounts of vegetables in menu A developed by female students and menu B taken from a recipe book were 350+\/-2 g and 457+\/-77 g, respectively. The average content of the nitrate was 321.0+\/-139.3 mg (104.2-636.9 mg) in menu A, and 245.7+\/-90.7 mg (140.1-507.3 mg) in menu B. Sixteen and thirteen samples exceeded the ADI in menus A and B, respectively. This may be because menu A contained more raw vegetables than menu B (menu A; 120+\/-58 g, menu B; 72+\/-71 g). The contents of nitrite in menu A and B were 1.2+\/-0.3 mg (0.7-1.8 mg) and 2.8+\/-0.9 mg (1.3-4.6 mg), respectively, and 6 samples in menu B exceeded the ADI. Intake of 350 g of vegetables or more in a day may require careful consideration of selection, frequency of use and cooking method, especially for vegetables with high nitrate content. A questionnaire to female students showed that 80% or more of students recognized that vegetables containing high contents of nitrate, such as spinach and komatsuna, should be boiled before eating them.","502":"An LC\/ESI (positive-mode)-MS\/MS method was developed for simultaneous quantification of 8 macrocyclic lactones (abamectin B1a, abamectin 8,9-Z isomer B1a, emamectin benzoate B1a, emamectin benzoate 8,9-Z isomer B1a, ivermectin, eprinomectin B1a, doramectin and moxidectin) in animal tissues, egg, milk and honey. The separation was achieved on a TSK-GEL ODS 100 V column (2.0 x 50 mm, 3 microm) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, and 0.1 mM ammonium formate-0.1% formic acid in water, at a flow rate of 0.2 mL\/min with gradient elution. Linear calibration plots were obtained with high correlation coefficients (r=0.998-0.999). The LOQ and LOD ranged from 0.02-1.5 ng\/mL and 0.1-5 ng\/mL, respectively. Average recoveries were in the range of 70.8-117.1% with associated RSD values&lt;15% (n=10) for repeatability and reproducibility. The spiking levels for recoveries and RSDs met the validation criteria for Japanese maximum residue limits (MRLs). Based on these results, the proposed analytical method has been proven to be highly efficient and suitable for routine determinations of macrocyclic lactones in animal food matrices.","503":"Surveillance of consumer complaints related to microbial contamination in soft drinks indicated that tea drinks, and juice and juice drinks were major soft drinks involved in complaints. The frequency of complaints about juice and juice drinks is relatively high in relation to the production amount. Damage to containers during distribution and inappropriate storage of soft drinks by consumers are major causes of complaints. Molds were predominantly associated with complaints and symptoms caused by intake of contaminated soft drinks. To reduce complaints, more support for small companies, and greater education for carriers, dealers and consumers are needed.","504":"The potential value of benzyl isothiocyanate (BIT) vapor for food preservation was investigated in comparison with allyl isothiocyanate (AIT) vapor. Measurements of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against various bacteria and fungi indicated that BIT vapor shows higher antibacterial activity towards Gram-positive bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria, than AIT vapor. BIT has a similar inhibitory effect to AIT against Gram-negative bacteria, yeast and fungi, except that it was less effective against Pseudomonas fluorescens JCM 5963. Both BIT and AIT have a strong inhibitory activity against yeast and fungi. AIT vapor suppressed growth of total aerobic bacteria in bigeye tuna meat and pork mince during storage at 10 degrees C and 30 degrees C, while BIT vapor had no effect. Also, AIT vapor strongly inhibited mycelial development of Aspergillus sojae JCM 2251 and Penicillium expansum IAM 13777 inoculated on rice cakes, while BIT vapor only slightly suppressed their growth. BIT has antimicrobial activities, but further studies are needed to establish its suitability for use in food preservation.","505":"A rapid and simple method for determination of theophylline, theobromine and caffeine in dietary supplements containing guarana by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) has been developed. Theophylline, theobromine and caffeine were extracted from finely powdered samples with water in a boiling water bath for 20 min, then the extracts were filtered and the filtrates were subjected to UPLC. Liquid samples were diluted with water and filteres, and the filtrates were subjected to UPLC. UPLC separation was performed on an AQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm i.d.x50 mm, 1.7 microm, Waters) with 10 mmol\/L ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.0)-acetonitrile gradient and eluates were monitored at 275 nm. The recoveries of theophylline (spiked at 200 microg\/g [tablet] and 50 microg\/mL [liquid]), theobromine (spiked at 200 microg\/g [tablet] and 50 microg\/mL [liquid]) and caffeine (spiked at 1,000 microg\/g [tablet] and 250 microg\/mL [liquid]) were 97.6-98.7%, 97.3-99.7%, 97.1-105.4%, respectively. The quantitation limits of theophylline, theobromine and caffeine were 10 microg\/g (seed, seed powder, tablet and capsule) and 2.0 microg\/mL (liquid) each. When this analytical method was applied to commercial dietary supplements, theophylline, theobromine and caffeine were found at concentrations of 4.45 mg\/tablet, 5.48 mg\/tablet, 139 mg\/tablet, respectively. Taking 4 tablets of this product according to the directions on the package could be dangerous to consumers because of possible overdosing of these ingredients.","506":"Sennoside A and B were detected in 21 commercial health tea products surveyed in 2000-2007, but there were 8 products in which the leaves could not be identified as senna because the leaves had become discolored. The results of assay of sennoside levels and TLC chromatograms suggested that processed senna had been used in these products. Next, with reference to tea and health tea manufacturing methods, pharmaceutical senna was roasted or wet-processed experimentally. The results indicated that the discolored leaves contained in commercial health tea were most likely derived from senna leaves. Moreover, sennosides in medicinal doses were detected in some processed senna samples, and were determined to have a cathartic action in mice. Based on morphological confirmation and the results of component analysis, including sennoside, the discolored leaves found in commercial health teas were therefore determined to be senna leaves. There may be possible health risks, including diarrhea.","507":"A simple analytical method for dibromophenols (DBPs) in flatfiish was developed. 2,4-DBP and 2,6-DBP were extracted from a sample with acetone and n-hexane, cleaned up by treatment with conc. sulfuric acid and concentrated under a stream of nitrogen gas. The resulting extract was subjected to GC\/MS. The recoveries of 2,4-DBP and 2,6-DBP were 89.4-96.5% and 81.4-86.2%, respectively, indicating that this method is useful for analysis of 2,4-DBP and 2,6-DBP. In the phenolic-smelling flatfish, 2,6-DBP was detected at the levels of 0.10 microg\/g and 0.01 microg\/g in skin and muscle, respectively, and 2,4-DBP was detected at the level of 0.02 microg\/g in skin.","508":"","509":"From 1990 to 2008, 9 food poisoning incidents due to ingestion of marine boxfish occurred in Nagasaki, Miyazaki, Mie and Kagoshima Prefectures, Japan, and a total of 13 persons were poisoned. Their main symptom was severe muscle pain arising from rhabdomyolysis, which was usually accompanied by the discharge of black urine and abnormal elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase. Twelve out of the 13 victims recovered in a few days to two months, while one died after approximately 2 weeks. Since the symptoms were very similar to those caused by parrotfish \"aobudai\" Scarus ovifrons poisoning, the causative substance was considered to be parrotfish toxin, i.e., a palytoxin-like substance. Epidemic surveys after the incidents in Miyazaki and Nagasaki identified the leftovers as \"hakofugu\" Ostracion immaculatus. During screening tests to clarify the toxicity of boxfish from Western Japan, 47 of 129 specimens (36.4%) of O. immaculatus, and 7 of 18 specimens (38.9%) of \"umisuzume\" Lactoria diaphana were found to show acute and\/or delayed lethal activity to mice (0.5-2.0 mouse unit\/g). Among the tissues tested, the frequency of toxicity was highest in the viscera excluding liver (28.6% in O. cubicus, 33.3% in L. diaphana), followed by muscle (10.9%, 5.6%) and liver (6.2%, 5.6%). From the above results, we conclude that O. cubicus and L. diaphana inhabiting the coast of Japan sometimes contain toxic substance(s), which can sporadically cause food poisonings very similar to parrotfish poisoning.","510":"A survey of pesticide residues in 600 imported fruit products on the Tokyo market from April 1994 to March 2006 was carried out. Thirty kinds of pesticides, including organophosphorus, organochlorine, carbamate, and pyrethroid, were detected between levels of Tr (below 0.01 ppm) to 0.37 ppm from 75 samples. Residual pesticides were detected from fruit products, dried fruits and pressed juice. A high frequency of pesticide residues was observed in peels, whole body of fruits and products which contained them. Residue levels of these pesticides were calculated as between less than 0.1 and 3.9% of their ADI values according to the daily intake of fruit products. Therefore, these fruit products should be safe when eaten in customary amounts.","511":"Pollution levels of toxic heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Hg) and arsenic in existing food additives used as food colors (40 samples of 15 kinds) were investigated. Heavy metals were detected in 8 samples; Pb in 1 sample (2.8 microg\/g), Hg in 8 samples (0.1-3.4 microg\/g) and arsenic in 2 samples (1.7, 2.6 microg\/g). The Pb level in 1 sample of lac color (2.8 microg\/g) exceeded the limit of 2 microg\/g proposed by JECFA and Hg levels in 3 samples of cacao color (1.2-3.4 microg\/g) exceeded the limit of 1 microg\/g in the EU specification.","512":"A simple and rapid method for determination of intentional contamination with heavy metals in foods using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) has been developed. The heavy metals were extracted with sulfuric acid in a disposable tube using a homogenizer. The extract was diluted with 1% HNO(3) solution and analyzed with ICP-AES. Recovery tests of 9 metals, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mn, Pb, Sb, Sn, and Tl, from 12 foods were performed, and gave acceptable recovery (71-107%) with low relative standard deviation (1-11%). The time required for conversion of 12 samples to test solutions was approximately 2 hr. This method could be useful for identification of heavy metals involved in food poisoning cases.","513":"A rapid and simple multiresidue method has been established for determination of pesticide residues in processed foods by GC\/MS\/MS. The pesticides were extracted with ethyl acetate, and were cleaned up with a double-layered SPE cartridge column (graphite carbon black\/PSA silica gel). Recovery tests of 258 pesticides from five kinds of processed foods (dumpling, curry, French fries, fried chicken, fried fish) were performed at two different fortification levels of 0.02 and 0.1 microg\/g, and 184 pesticides showed acceptable recovery (70-120%) with relative standard deviation of &lt;or=20% at both concentrations. The high selectivity of GC\/MS\/MS gives a very clean chromatogram, making compound identification and confirmation easy. This method could be applied to the determination of pesticide residues in processed foods.","514":"A total of 36 specimens of 5 xanthid crab species, Zosimus aeneus (n=16), Xanthias lividus (n=4), Leptodius sanguineus (n=3), Daira perlata (n=10) and Eriphia sebana (n=3), were collected around Nakanoshima Island, which is located at the northeastern part of the Tokara Islands, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan in May and July 2000, and their toxicity was determined by mouse bioassay. Nine of 16 Z. aeneus specimens and all of 4 X. lividus specimens showed lethal potency to mice (2.1-11 MU\/g, 2.8-8.6 MU\/g, respectively), whereas all the other species were non-toxic (less than 2.0 MU\/g). LC\/MS analyses indicated that the toxin of the Z. aeneus specimens was mainly composed of tetrodotoxin (41% of total toxicity), and 11-oxotetrodotoxin contributed to the remaining toxicity. The toxin of the X. lividus specimens, however, was apparently not tetrodotoxin. In HPLC-FLD analyses, no paralytic shellfish poison component was detected in either of the two toxic species.","515":"Consumption of potassium permanganate and total organic carbon (TOC) were investigated as indices of total organic matter migrated into water from plastic kitchen utensils, food packages and toys for children. The samples were soaked in water at 60 or 95 degrees C for 30 min for kitchen utensils and food packages, and at 40 degrees C for 30 min for toys and the eluates were examined, using the two indices. The quantitation limits were both 0.5 microg\/mL. Among 97 kitchen utensils and food packages tested, consumption of potassium permanganate and TOC were 0.5-10.9 microg\/mL and ND-18.9 microg\/mL for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tea-pot spouts and nylon kitchen utensils, respectively. Among 32 toys tested, the levels were 0.8-45.5 microg\/mL and 0.5-8.9 microg\/mL from PVC toys and block toys made by ethylene vinyl acetate resin. The levels for other samples were very low. There were large discrepancies between consumption of potassium permanganate and TOC for some PVC products and nylon kitchen utensils. The cause may be a marked difference of the oxidation decomposition rate by potassium permanganate, depending on the kind of organic matter that migrated from the plastics.","516":"Cardboard boxes used to transport crops are often reused in the distribution process, and therefore transfer of pesticides between crops might occur. So, we designed model experiments to investigate whether or not transfer of pesticide residues from crops to other crops via cardboard boxes occurs. Under severe experimental conditions, 6.2% of the pesticide residues of grapefruit was found to be transferred to spinach via cardboard boxes. In the case of the mandarin orange, 0.57% was transferred. The actual amount of transferred pesticides in the market may be less than that in these model experiments, but it is clear that transfer of pesticide residues to other crops via cardboard boxes can occur. Therefore more attention must be given to reuse of cardboard boxes in the distribution process.","517":"It is considered to be difficult to detect tetracycline antibiotics in all-at-once simultaneous analysis with other drugs by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, because tetracycline antibiotics chelate with bivalent metal ions such as calcium in samples. Therefore, we studied simultaneous determination of tetracycline antibiotics after removal of calcium with disodium ethylenediaminotetraacetate (EDTA-2Na). Tetracycline antibiotics could be assayed in all-at-once analysis by adding EDTA-2Na during the extraction procedure. It was possible to determine 65 veterinary drugs in milk, 70 in yogurt, 59 in whipped cream, 67 in cheese and 60 in ice cream. Recovery ranged from 70 to 120%, with a coefficient of variation of less than 25% and with a quantification limit of 0.01 microg\/g (S\/N&gt;or=10).","518":"The primary data obtained from real-time PCR is the fluorescence intensity. We developed new software, GiMlet, to analyze the fluorescence data more effectively. To examine factors affecting the variance of the Ct values calculated from the fluorescence data, we conducted measurements of the same test solutions containing defined numbers of copies of the targeted DNA sequence using three kinds of real-time PCR equipment, namely, ABI PRISM 7500, 7700 and 7900HT, under consistent conditions, and analyzed the obtained fluorescence data using GiMlet. We also introduced a new baseline correction algorithm in GiMlet and examined the effect of this correction on the measurement results. The results revealed that the variances of the measured values and the PCR efficiency differed among the three kinds of real-time PCR equipment used and also according to the well-position of the PCR plate. The fluorescence data could be analyzed more precisely using the new algorithm.","519":"A rapid and simple multiresidue method has been established for determination of pesticide residues in processed foods by GC\/MS. The pesticides were extracted with ethyl acetate in the presence of anhydrous MgSO(4) in a disposable tube, using a homogenizer. The extract was concentrated and reconstituted in hexane, followed by acetonitrile-hexane partition to remove lipids. The acetonitrile layer was cleaned up with a double-layered SPE cartridge column (graphite carbon black\/PSA silica gel). After removal of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in acetone. The test solution was subjected to GC\/MS in the EI mode. Recovery tests of 222 pesticides from five kinds of processed foods (dumpling, curry, French fries, fried chicken, fried fish) were performed at two different fortification levels of 0.02 and 0.1 microg\/g, and 100 pesticides showed acceptable recovery (70-120%) with low relative standard deviation (&lt;or=20%) at both concentrations. A survey of pesticide residues in 75 commercial processed foods was carried out. Chlorpropham was detected at 0.04 ppm in a sample of French fries.","520":"","521":"Perchlorate (ClO(4)(-)) is both a naturally occurring and artificial compound, and it inhibits iodide uptake into the thyroid gland and disturbs thyroid function. It has been detected in many foods in the United States. In order to investigate perchlorate contamination in foods in Japan, perchlorate level in 82 leafy vegetable samples and 20 bottled mineral water samples was measured using a procedure based on the FDA's procedure, employing IC-MS\/MS with (18)O(4)-labeled perchlorate as an internal standard. Among 82 leafy vegetable samples tested, perchlorate levels were under the LOQ (0.3 ng\/g) in 3 samples and ranged from 0.3 ng\/g to 29.7 ng\/g in 79 samples. In 20 bottled water samples, perchlorate was under the LOQ (0.1 ng\/mL) in 14 samples and ranged from 0.14 ng\/mL to 0.35 ng\/mL in 6 samples.","522":"A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for verifying the allergen labeling of foods (i.e., the presence of wheat, buckwheat, or peanut) was adopted as the official Japanese identification test by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan in 2002. We have verified the wheat labeling of several commercial food items by using the adopted PCR method. The study has revealed that some foods with positive results in the screening test yielded negative results in the identification test. When the result of the screening test disagrees with that of the identification test, the validation of food labeling is remarkably difficult. Therefore, we developed a nested PCR method with high sensitivity and specificity and employed this method in our routine testing as necessary. In this study, we examined 11 types of models of processed foods containing 10 microg\/g wheat protein by using the adopted PCR and nested PCR methods; these samples were prepared by various processes and had varying physical properties. The adopted and nested PCR methods enabled the detection of wheat in 8 and 10 types of food models, respectively. The reasons for the failure in detecting the food allergens include DNA fragmentation due to the processing of food and the presence of DNA from other sources in the extracted DNA. In both PCR methods, an increase in the amount of template DNA in the PCR mixture enabled the detection of wheat DNA in all the food samples, but an excessive increase in the amount of template DNA hindered PCR amplification. These results indicate that an increase in the amount of template DNA increases the efficiency of the detection of allergens in processed foods by conventional PCR. Further investigation is needed to remove factors that inhibit PCR amplification of the extracted DNA.","523":"The influence of Nisaplin, which contains 2.5% nisin, on the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in Karashi-mentaiko (red-pepper seasoned cod roe) was investigated. The MICs of Nisaplin for L. monocytogenes (10(8) CFU\/mL) were measured; seven isolates showed a value of 1,600 microg\/mL and one isolate showed a value of 800 microg\/mL. All L. monocytogenes isolates had a MIC of 800 microg\/mL at 10(6) CFU\/mL. The number of L. monocytogenes in Karashi-mentaiko stored at 4 degrees C was decreased by Nisaplin added at 60 and 600 microg\/g. These results indicated that Nisaplin effectively inhibits the growth of L. monocytogenes in Karashi-mentaiko.","524":"A simple method was developed for determination of illudin S in fungi (Omphalotus guepiniformis: poisonous mushroom) and a food that caused food poisoning, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS). Illudin S in fungi and the food that caused food poisoning was extracted with methanol and then cleaned up with an Oasis HLB cartridge. LC separation was performed with an octadecylated silica column (Inertsil ODS-3, 2.1 mm i.d. x 150 mm) and a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid-methanol (7 : 3) at a flow rate 0.2 mL\/min. Mass spectral acquisition was performed in the positive mode and illudin S was targeted using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with electrospray ionization (ESI). The recoveries of illudin S were 84-94% from edible fungi (Lentinula edodes, Pleurotus ostreatus and Panellus serotinus). The detection limits of illudin S in the fungi (L. edodes, P. ostreatus and P. serotinus) were 0.08-0.10 microg\/g respectively. Illudin S was detected in the food that caused food poisoning at the level of 2.0 and 15.1 microg\/g in the soup and fungi, respectively. The recovery of illudin S from a mushroom soup (cooked at 100 degrees C for 10 min) sample which simulated food poisoning was 74.8%. These results indicate that the developed method is suitable for the determination of illudin S in fungi (O. guepiniformis) and foods that caused food poisoning.","525":"A highly sensitive analytical method for 25 kinds of primary aromatic amines and azo-dyes in paper products was developed. Free amines and total amines of the samples were analyzed. The amount of each azo-dye was calculated from the amount of total amines by subtracting the amount of free amines. Amines and azo-dyes were migrated into water at 23 degrees C for 24 hours. Free amines were extracted into dichloromethane after alkalization with sodium hydroxide solution. Azo-dyes were reduced to amines with sodium dithionite, alkalized, and then extracted into dichloromethane as total amines. They were determined by GC\/MS. The recoveries of 100 microg\/kg amines spiked into migration solution were in the range of 69-122%, except for 4,4'-oxydianiline and 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane which gave recovery rates of approximately 40%. The determination limits of amines were 4-20 microg\/kg in paper. Amines and azo-dyes were surveyed in 17 kinds of base paper and 16 kinds of paper products for food contact use. Aniline was detected at levels of 4-20 microg\/kg from most recycled papers, whereas the other amines were not detected in any sample.","526":"When unheated whole samples of crustaceans (shrimp, prawn and crab) were analyzed with our ELISA kit (FA test EIA-Crustacean 'Nissui') using anti-tropomyosin antibodies, a remarkable reduction in reactivity was recognized. This reduction in activity was found to be due to the digestion of tropomyosin during the extraction process by proteases contained in cephalothorax. To avoid the digestion of tropomyosin by proteases, we developed an extraction method (heating method) suitable for the detection of tropomyosin in unheated crustaceans including cephalothorax. Experiments with unheated whole samples of various species of crustaceans confirmed that the heating method greatly improved the low reactivity in the standard method; the heating method gave extraction efficiencies of as high as 93-107%. Various processed crustaceans with cephalothorax, such as dry products (unheated or weakly heated products) and pickles in soy sauce (unheated products), that showed low reactivity with the standard method were confirmed to give superior results with the heating method. These results indicated that the developed heating method is suitable for detecting unheated crustaceans with cephalothorax by means of the ELISA kit.","527":"Pesticide residues in 165 imported vegetable products on the Tokyo market from Apr. 1992 to Mar. 2006 were investigated. Seven kinds of pesticides were detected at levels between Tr (below 0.01 ppm) and 1.0 ppm from 16 samples. There was no sample in which pesticide residues exceeded the MRLs. The salt leaf of grape imported from Greece contained chlorpyrifos and quinalphos, and there was some doubt as to whether the residue levels exceeded the MRLs when the Japanese positive list system for pesticide residues in food was applied. Pesticides were detected from pickles and dehydrated vegetable, but not from products that had been treated with heat and water, such as boiled vegetables and purees. Many samples of products from Asia, and North America area contained detectable levels of pesticides. Residue levels of these pesticides were calculated as between 0.006 and 20.3% of their ADI values according to the daily intake of vegetable products. Therefore, these vegetable products should be safe when eaten in a normal manner.","528":"Genetically modified maize MON863 (MON863), which has passed a safety examination in Japan, is commercially cultivated in the United States as a food and a resource for fuel. Maize is an anemophilous flower, which easily hybridizes. However, an official method for quantifying the content of MON863 has not been provided yet in Japan. We here examined MON863 contamination in maize-processed foods that had no labeling indicating of the use of genetically modified maize.From March 2006 to July 2008, we purchased 20 frozen maize products, 8 maize powder products, 7 canned maize products and 4 other maize processed foods. Three primer pairs named MON 863 primer, MON863-1, and M3\/M4 for MON863-specific integrated cassette were used for qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A primer pair \"SSIIb-3\" for starch synthase gene was used to confirm the quality of extracted DNA. The starch synthase gene was detected in all samples. In qualitative tests, the MON863-specific fragments were detected in 7 (18%) maize powder products out of the 39 processed foods with all the three primer pairs.We concluded that various maize processed foods on the market were contaminated with MON863. It is important to accumulate further information on MON863 contamination in maize-processed foods that have no label indication of the use of genetically modified maize.","529":"A sample preparation method was developed for determination of quinolones in honey using immunoaffinity resin. For this purpose, an immunoaffinity resin for quinolones was prepared by coupling a quinolone-specific monoclonal antibody to agarose resin. Honey samples diluted with phosphate buffer were reacted with immunoaffinity resin. After the resin was washed, quinolones were eluted with glycine-HCl. Quinolones in the eluate were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. No interfering peak was found on the chromatograms of honey samples. The recoveries of quinolones from samples were over 70% at fortification levels of 20 ng\/g (for norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin) and 10 ng\/g (for danofloxacin). The quantification limits of quinolones were 2 ng\/g. This sample preprocessing method using immunoaffinity resin was found to be effective and suitable for determining residual quinolones in honey.","530":"A method using liquid chromatograph coupled with tandem mass spectrometer (LC\/MS\/MS) was developed for the determination of melamine in processed food. After extraction with 50% acetonitrile and clean-up with PSA and SCX, the quantification limit of melamine in processed food was 0.5 microg\/g. The recoveries and relative standard deviations were 113 to 115% and less than 5%, respectively. Therefore, we considered that the developed method offers high precision and sensitivity for the determination of melamine in processed food. When the method was applied to six suspected products, 0.8 to 37 microg\/g of melamine was detected from four milk-rich products.","531":"We investigated the survival of bacterial pathogens in grain products. Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus survived for more than 3 weeks in grain flakes. Although S. Enteritidis in grain flakes reached a level of less than 10(2) CFU\/g, the surviving organisms grew rapidly in milk and reached 10(9) CFU\/g after 25-hr incubation. When catechins were present on the grain flakes, the numbers of S. Enteritidis and S. aureus were significantly decreased. In addition, catechins reduced the survival and growth of S. Enteritidis, S. aureus and Bacillus cereus when added to cooked grain products. This study indicates that S. Enteritidis, S. aureus and Bacillus can survive for a long time in grain products and that catechins impair their survival and growth.","532":"A duplex real-time PCR method was developed for quantitative screening analysis of GM maize. The duplex real-time PCR simultaneously detected two GM-specific segments, namely the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (P35S) segment and an event-specific segment for GA21 maize which does not contain P35S. Calibration was performed with a plasmid calibrant specially designed for the duplex PCR. The result of an in-house evaluation suggested that the analytical precision of the developed method was almost equivalent to those of simplex real-time PCR methods, which have been adopted as ISO standard methods for the analysis of GMOs in foodstuffs and have also been employed for the analysis of GMOs in Japan. In addition, this method will reduce both the cost and time requirement of routine GMO analysis by half. The high analytical performance demonstrated in the current study would be useful for the quantitative screening analysis of GM maize. We believe the developed method will be useful for practical screening analysis of GM maize, although interlaboratory collaborative studies should be conducted to confirm this.","533":"The effect of the reconstruction and storage conditions of powdered infant formula (PIF) on the survival and growth of three Enterobacter sakazakii strains, ATCC 29004, HT 022 and HT 028, was investigated. D values of E. sakazakii ATCC 29004 and HT 022 at 60 degrees C were 3.6 and 1.6 min, respectively, and that of HT 028 at 52 degrees C was 1.6 min. The effect of the temperature of the water used for the reconstruction of PIF on the inactivation of the three E. sakazakii strains was also investigated. One to 2 log order inactivation occurred at 70 degrees C, and above 5 log order inactivation at 80 degrees C. Storage tests at 5, 10 and 25 degrees C showed that none of the strains could grow at 5 degrees C, HT 028 grew slightly at 10 degrees C, and at 25 degrees C all three strains started growth after 4 hr incubation and reached up to 8 log CFU\/mL after 16 hr incubation. From the above results, it is concluded that a suitable temperature of the hot water for reconstruction of PIF is above 70 degrees C, and the preferred storage temperature of reconstructed PIF, which is recommended to be consumed within 2 hr, is below 5 degrees C.","534":"A multiresidue screening method using GC\/MS and LC\/MS was investigated for analysis of 202 pesticides (including metabolites) in meat. Many target pesticides with a wide range of polarity were successfully extracted with ethyl acetate-cyclohexane (1 : 1) from meat samples rich in lipid components. Matrix components such as cholesterol, monoglycerides and fatty acids were effectively eliminated by means of GPC and 2 kinds of mini-columns (PSA and Silica). These procedures enabled analysis in the SCAN mode by GC\/MS and LC\/MS without any matrix interference. Among the pesticides tested, 17 had low recoveries (&lt;50%), but 185 pesticides showed acceptable recoveries of 50-140% when spiked at 0.1 microg\/g into muscle of beef, chicken and pork. The limits of quantitation were 0.01 microg\/g, except for linuron, triforine and isoxaflutole (&lt;0.02 microg\/g). This proposed method is expected to be useful for screening analysis of residual pesticides in meat.","535":"The migration tests of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) from paint film on baby toys set out in the Japanese Food Sanitation Law (official standard) and International Standard 8124-3 (ISO) were compared. Vinyl chloride resin enamel and acrylic resin enamel containing 1,000 mg\/kg Cd and Pb on a dried basis were painted on glass plates and then dried. According to the official standard, the paint films on the glass plates were soaked in water at 40 degrees C for 30 min and the solutions were analyzed by ICP-AES. Cd and Pb were below the limit of determinotion (&lt;0.1 microg\/mL) and were less than 1\/5-1\/10 of the official standard limits. When the solvent was changed to 4% acetic acid or 0.07 mol\/L HCl, we found that 0.3-2.3 microg\/mL Cd and Pb migrated from the acrylic resin enamel, but no migration was observed from the vinyl chloride resin enamel. Meanwhile, according to the ISO method, paint was scratched from the glass plates and the powder was soaked in 0.07 mol\/L HCl at 37 degrees C for 1 hr either with shaking and without shaking. The migration of Cd and Pb reached 310 to 910 mg\/kg, i.e., 3.5-12 times more than the migration limits. Cd migrated more extensively than Pb, and they both migrated more readily from the acrylic resin enamel than from the vinyl chloride enamel. In conclusion, the migration test of Cd and Pb from paint films on toys based on the ISO standards is stricter than that based on the Japanese Food Sanitation Low.","536":"In Japan, PCR identification of species-specific, animal group-specific and plant DNA is employed as part of the audit program to ensure compliance with the feed ban in place for the control of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Since October 2001, animal proteins other than dairy proteins, egg proteins and gelatin have been prohibited to be used in feed for ruminants. Meat-and-bone meal (MBM) derived from poultry, pig and\/or fish is allowed to be used in feed for poultry, pigs and fish. Porcine MBM is permitted in feed for domestic animals other than cattle since April 2005. Given the fact that pigs and cattle are the two major sources of MBM in Japan, the identification of porcine DNA with high specificity and sensitivity has become increasingly important to ensure that MBM products are free from ruminant materials. Two PCR primer sets (PPA8 and PPA6) were newly designed using mtATP8 and mtATP6 as the target sequences, with relatively short amplification sizes. PPA8 and PPA6 were able to specifically detect porcine DNA with the detection limits of 0.01% and 0.001% of porcine MBM in feed, respectively. PPA6 was superior to PPA8 in terms of detection of DNA damaged\/fragmented during rendering procedures. The PCR method using these primer sets is registered as the official analytical method for feed in Japan.","537":"Survival of Salmonella in black tiger shrimps during frozen storage was investigated following our previous study on Salmonella contamination in frozen shrimps imported into Japan. Salmonella (S.) Weltevreden and S. Senftenberg were inoculated onto the surface and inside of black tiger shrimps without the shell. After storage at -10 degrees C, -20 degrees C and -30 degrees C for 12 weeks, the Salmonella population decreased in all cases; the decrease was smallest at the lowest temperature. Viability of Salmonella inoculated onto the surface of the shrimp was greater than that inside the shrimp. In addition, viability of S. Senftenberg was greater than that of S. Weltevreden. These results suggest that hygienic handling during thawing of shrimps is important from the viewpoint of Salmonella contamination.","538":"To determine the tolerable upper intake level of nicotinic acid in humans, we investigated the effects of excess nicotinic acid administration on body weight gain, food intake, and urinary excretion of water-soluble vitamins and the metabolism of tryptophan in weaning rats. The weaning rats were freely fed a niacin-free 20% casein diet (control diet) or the same diet with 0.1%, 0.3% or 0.5% nicotinic acid for 23 days. The excess nicotinic acid intake did not affect body weight gain, food intake, serotonin contents in the brain, stomach and small intestine, or the urinary excretions of water-soluble vitamins. Although excess nicotinic acid did not affect the upper part of the tryptophan-nicotinamide pathway, 0.5% nicotinic acid diet increased the urinary excretion of quinolinic acid. The diet containing more than 0.3% nicotinic acid also increased the urinary excretion of nicotinic acid, which is usually below the limit of detection. As determined from the results of body weight gain and food intake as indices for apparent adverse effects, the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for nicotinic acid was 0.5% in diet, corresponding to 450 mg\/kg body weight\/day. As judged from in increase of urinary quinolinic acid and nicotinic acid as indices of metabolic change, NOAEL was 0.1% in diet, corresponding to 90 mg\/kg body weight\/day, and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) was 0.3% in diet, corresponding to 270 mg\/kg body weight\/day.","539":"To determine the tolerable upper intake level of pyridoxine-HCl in humans, we investigated the effects of excess pyridoxine-HCl administration on body weight gain, food intake, tissue weight, and urinary excretion of water-soluble vitamins in weaning rats. The weaning rats were freely fed ordinary diet containing 0.0007% pyridoxine-HCl (control diet) or the same diet with 0.1%, 0.5%, 0.8% or 1.0% pyridoxine-HCl for 30 days. The body weight gain in the 0.8% and 1.0% groups, and the total food intake in the 1.0% group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The urinary excretion of pantothenic acid in the pyridoxine-HCl added groups were higher than that in the control group, while excessive pyridoxine-HCl intake did not affect the urinary excretion of other water-soluble vitamins. These results showed that the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for pyridoxine-HCl was 0.1% in diet, corresponding to 90 mg\/kg body weight\/day, and lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) was 0.5% in diet, corresponding to 450 mg\/kg body weight\/day.","540":"To determine the tolerable upper intake levels of vitamin B(1) and vitamin B(2) in humans, we investigated the effects of excess thiamin or riboflavin administration on body weight gain, food intake, tissue weights, and urinary excretion of B-group vitamins in weaning rats. The weaning rats were freely fed ordinary diet containing 0.0006% thiamin-HCl or the same diet with 0.006%, 0.03%, 0.18% or 1.0% thiamin-HCl for 30 days, or the diet containing 0.0006% riboflavin or the same diet with 0.1%, 0.5 or 1.0% riboflavin for 22 days. Mild diarrhea was seen only in the rats fed with 1.0% thiamin-HCl diet. Excess thiamin-HCl or riboflavin did not affect body weight gains, food intake or tissue weights. The urinary excretions of water-soluble vitamins also did not differ among the diets. These results clearly showed that feeding a diet containing up to 1.0% thiamin-HCl or 1.0% riboflavin did not induce apparent adverse effects, and the no-observed-adverse-effect-levels (NOAELs) for thiamin-HCl and riboflavin in rats might be 1.0% in diet, corresponding to 900 mg\/kg body weight\/day.","541":"We studied the simultaneous determination of demeton-S-methyl, oxydemeton-methyl, and their oxide demeton-S-methylsulfone, in agricultural products by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The sample homogenized with antioxidants L-ascorbic acid and butylhydroxytoluene was extracted with acetone. An aliquot of the crude extract was reextracted with ethyl acetate by using an EXtrelut column. After hexane\/acetonitrile partitioning lipid-rich samples such as cereals, the extract was cleaned up on a PSA column or tandem graphitized carbon\/PSA column, and determined by ESI-SIM mode LC-MS. Average recoveries (n=5) of compounds from ten kinds of samples fortified at the analyte concentration of 0.05 microg\/g were from 73.8% to 102.5%, and the relative standard deviations were &lt;or=5.7%.","542":"A method for the determination of dodine in agricultural products was developed by using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC\/ESI-MS). Dodine was extracted with acetonitrile and then acetonitrile-water (7 : 3) from a sample, and re-extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was cleaned up on a PSA cartridge column (500 mg), and dodine was analyzed by LC\/MS. In the case of oil seeds and nuts, hexane\/acetonitrile-hydrochloric acid partition was performed to remove lipids before re-extraction with ethyl acetate. In the case of samples that contained a lot of chlorophyll, the eluate of the PSA cartridge column was further cleaned up on a graphitized carbon cartridge column (500 mg). The calibration curve was linear from 0.0001-0.02 microg\/mL of dodine. The recoveries of dodine from sixteen kinds of agricultural products fortified at 0.1 mg\/kg were 80.3-100.0%, and their relative standard deviations were 0.3-6.4%. The limits of detection (S\/N=3) were 0.0006 mg\/kg.","543":"A novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) method was developed for trace residue determination of bicozamycin (BZM) in livestock products and seafoods. BZM was extracted from a sample with acetonitrile-water (4 : 1), followed by a two-stage SPE enrichment and cleanup. The first stage involved a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer cartridge (GL-Pak PLS-2), and the second stage involved a divinylbenzene-N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer cartridge (Oasis HLB). The LC separation was performed on a C18 column using 0.01% formic acid-methanol (8 : 2) as the mobile phase and MS detection with negative ion electrospray ionization. The mean recoveries from swine muscle, liver, yellowtail, and milk fortified at the minimum residue limit (MRL) levels and 0.01 microg\/g were &gt;70%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were &lt;20%. Limits of quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 0.002 to 0.005 microg\/g.","544":"Natural contamination by zearalenone, a toxic metabolite of Fusarium fungi, was surveyed in 160 samples of sorghum imported from 2001 to 2006 into Japan for feed. Of these 160 samples, 84 (52.5%) were contaminated with zearalenone, ranging in concentration from 60 to 7.260 microg\/kg. In the contaminated sorghum samples, F. semitectum, F. verticillioides, F. oxysporum, and other Fusarium spp. were detected. The concentration of zearalenone was well correlated with the development of colonies of F. semitectum and other Fusarium spp. When the isolates of F. semitectum and F. verticillioides were cultivated on sorghum, zearalenone was found only in F. semitectum culture. These results indicate that F. semitectum is a causal fungus of zearalenone contamination in sorghum.","545":"Genetically modified (GM) sugar beets have been bred for use as food and animal feed. To evaluate the applicability of GMO analyses to beet sugar products, we investigated residual DNA in eight sorts of in-process beet sugar samples and commercial beet sugar products. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses with taxon-specific primers indicated that sugar beet DNA was degraded at an early stage of sugar processing, and no PCR amplification was detected from the investigated sugar products because of low DNA recovery and\/or PCR inhibition.","546":"Aerobic bacteria counts and contamination with Salmonella were investigated in a total of 1,327 samples of commercial liquid egg in 1992-2002. Salmonella was isolated from 8.1% of the samples, and Salmonella contamination was found in 1.7% of even the pasteurized liquid egg samples. The major Salmonella serotype was Enteritidis from more than 50% of the contaminated liquid egg samples. In addition, the aerobic bacteria counts in Salmonella-positive liquid eggs were significantly higher than those of Salmonella-negative samples. However, Salmonella was detected in liquid egg in which the aerobic bacteria counts were in the range of 10(2) to 10(6) cfu\/g. Furthermore, foodborne outbreaks of Salmonella infections associated with liquid egg were analyzed. Liquid eggs should be carefully treated to avoid the possibility of Salmonella contamination. Adequate supply of pasteurized liquid eggs and controls to prevent re-contamination are needed.","547":"The concentrations of nitrates in total diet samples prepared at 11 places were determined according to the market basket method, and the daily intake of nitrates was estimated based on the analysis results. The mean estimated daily intake of nitrates was 200 mg\/man\/day (4.0 mg\/kg\/day) and exceeded the ADI (3.7 mg\/kg\/day) set by the JECFA by 8%. The principal sources of the nitrates were colored vegetables (7th food group) and other vegetables, seaweeds and mushrooms (8th food group), and the intake from these food groups accounted for more than 80% of the total intake. The reported concentrations of nitrates in individual foods and the estimated daily intake of these foods indicate that the intake of nitrates from spinach accounts for 38% of the ADI, that from Chinese cabbage for 10%, and that from Japanese radish for 20%.","548":"From September 2007 to January 2008, a total of 66 specimens of 7 gastropod species, Nassarius (Alectrion) glans (n=22), Bufonaria rana (n=11), Ficus subintermedia (n=10), Stellaria (Onustus) exutus (n=8), Tonna luteostoma (n=7), Hemifusus tuba (n=4) and Semicassis bisulcata persimilis (n=4), were collected from Tachibana Bay, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, and their toxicity was determined by mouse bioassay. Among the gastropods tested, all N. glans specimens were toxic, whereas no other species showed toxicity of more than 5 MU\/g. The toxicity scores of N. glans were very high; 48-2,730 MU\/g(775+\/-615 MU\/g)in the muscle, and 16-10,200 MU\/g(1,490+\/-2,530 MU\/g)in the viscera, including digestive gland. Interestingly, toxin was localized in the muscle in 13 of 22 specimens, where the total toxicity of the muscle (725-9,860 MU\/individual) was 5.9-110 times higher than that of the viscera. LC\/MS analysis demonstrated that the toxin of N. glans consisted mainly of TTX, which accounting for about 60-65% of the total toxicity. As for the remaining toxicity, participation of 11-oxoTTX was suggested. No paralytic shellfish poison was detected in HPLC-FLD analysis.","549":"Jamaica quassia extract is a natural bittering agent used as a food additive in Japan. The main constituents of the extract have already been reported to be quassin and neoquassin. In this study, the differences in composition of the constituents among four Jamaican quassia extract products were analyzed by LC\/MS. The results showed that the four products have similar compositions of their minor constituents, as well as their main constituents. We isolated four of the minor constituents that were commonly included in the four products, and identified them as 11-dihydro-12-norneoquassin, canthin-6-one, 4-methoxy-1-vinyl-beta-carboline and 4,9-dimethoxy-1-vinyl-beta-carboline. The List of Existing Food Additives in Japan mentions that Jamaica quassia (Picrasma excelsa) is the original plant from which Jamaica quassia extract is produced. However, we presume that Jamaica quassia extract may actually be made from appropriate plants other than Picrasma excelsa, since P. excelsa is listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. We prepared hot water extracts from two other species of plants, Quassia amara (American quassia, Surinam quassia) and P. quassioides ('Nigaki' in Japanese), and investigated their constituents by LC\/MS. The results showed that the compositions of the constituents in the Jamaica quassia extract products resembled those in the extract derived from Q. amara. These findings suggest that Jamaica quassia extract products are probably made from Q. amara.","550":"A rapid and easy multiresidue method for determination of pesticide residues in Chinese dumplings using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) has been developed. Pesticide residues were extracted with ethyl acetate in the presence of anhydrous magnesium sulfate in a disposable tube using a homogenizer. The extract was concentrated and reconstituted in hexane, followed by acetonitrile-hexane partition to remove lipids. The acetonitrile layer was purified with a double-layered cartridge column (graphite carbon black\/primary secondary amine silica gel). After removal of the solvent, the extract was resolved in methanol\/water and analyzed with LC-MS\/MS. Recovery tests of 99 pesticide residues from Chinese dumpling were performed at 20 and 100 ng\/g, and 72 pesticides exhibited acceptable recoveries (70-120%) with low relative standard deviations (&lt;20%) at both concentrations. The time for sample preparation with 12 samples to test solutions was approximately 6 hr. This method could be useful for determination of pesticide residues in the Chinese dumplings.","551":"A simple and rapid method using electron capture detector gas chromatography (GC-ECD) was developed for the determination of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in Food Red Nos. 104 and 105. The sample was dissolved in water and HCB was extracted with hexane. The GC-ECD operating conditions were as follows: column, InertCap 5 MS\/NP (30 m x 0.25 mm i. d. with 0.25 microm film thickness); oven temperature, 60 degrees C(1 min)--&gt;20 degrees C\/min--&gt;150 degrees C(10 min)--&gt;20 degrees C\/min--&gt;280 degrees C(5 min); inlet temperature, 260 degrees C; detector temperature, 300 degrees C; carrier gas, nitrogen (constant press 25 psi); inlet mode, splitless. For the evaluation of the method, HCB spiked into R104 and R105 at the levels of 2 microg\/g and 5 microg\/g was determined in replicate in five laboratories. Mean recoveries of HCB from R104 and R105 were 98.2-103.7%. Repeatability relative standard deviation values were 2.9-6.0% and reproducibility relative standard deviation values were 4.2-9.3%. HORRAT value was less than one. From these results, the validity of this method was confirmed.","552":"The distribution interval of calibration curves in real-time PCR was successfully predicted from the variance of the Ct values, and the predicted distribution interval was consistent with the interval of the actual calibration curves. Although the width of the 95% confidence interval at the lower end was about 1%, the copy number estimated from individual calibration curves was distributed over a wider range, and the 95% confidence interval of the estimates of 20 copies was +\/-40%. The variances of the Ct values at 20 copies were significantly larger than those at higher copy numbers, and this large variation increased the distribution interval of the calibration curves. The variation, however, can be attributed to the probabilistic distribution of copy numbers in the measurement system, and is impossible to reduce by improvement of the analytical methodology. The 95% confidence interval of the calibration curves obtained after omitting 20 copies was decreased and the measurement precision was improved.","553":"Toxicity study was conducted using an official method (mouse assay) on 77 individual starfishes of the Astropecten genus collected in 5 sites inside Toyama Bay during the period from July 2002 to January 2003. Three kinds of starfishes were toxic, i.e., Astropecten polyacanthus, A. scoparius, and A. latespinosus meissner. Of A. polyacanthus. Those collected in the winter and spring were highly toxic, and there were regional differences in toxicity. The toxicity of A. latespinosus meissner, which inhibits only Himi, was less than that of A. polyacanthus. The toxicity of A. scoparius was weak. Toxic components were extracted and analyzed by LC\/MS. Tetrodotoxin and related substances were confirmed to be present in all 3 kinds of starfishes.","554":"To ensure the safety of processed foods, we developed a method for simultaneous determination of residual veterinary drugs in some processed foods. Eighty-nine compounds were selected for the analysis based on reports of illegal use of the veterinary drugs and our research information. In our LC\/MS\/MS system, an Atlantis C(18) column, which could separate a wide range of compounds, was used with a gradient system of 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. Sharp and symmetrical peaks with sufficient signal intensity were obtained. In this system, the recovery rates of detected veterinary drugs in processed foods were mostly in the range of 60-120%. Therefore, it is considered that this method is suitable for screening of residual veterinary drugs in processed foods.","555":"A simple and rapid method using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) was developed for the determination of 25 kinds of sulfonamides in livestock products and seafoods. The sulfonamides were extracted with acetonitrile by glass bead homogenization and cleaned up with a tandem-connected ODS and basic alumina column. The quantification limits of 25 kinds of sulfonamides were 0.0025-0.005 microg\/g. When two sulfonamides of specific samples were excluded, the recoveries and relative standard deviations were 70 to 120% and less than 15%. These results show that the developed method, which minimizes the matrix effect, offers high precision and should be useful for the determination of sulfonamides in livestock products and seafoods.","556":"Factors such as low recovery rate and food contaminants may be responsible for the difficulty of detecting Norovirus (NV) by PCR in foodborne outbreaks. To detect NV more efficiently, we introduced a bacterial treatment, in which concentrated samples were incubated overnight with Klebsiella oxytoca at 35 degrees C before RNA extraction using the standard protocol. Recovery rates of NVs (G I\/8 or G II\/13) added to food suspensions in the modified method were compared with those in the standard method by quantification of NV RNAs using real-time PCR. Recovery rates in the modified method were 8.6% for G I\/8 and 11.6% for G II\/13 in 18 oyster samples and 13.9% for G I\/8 and 19.6% for G II\/13 in 15 other food samples, while those in the standard method were 0.3% for G I\/8 and 0.5% for G II\/13 in the oyster samples and 1.9% for G I\/8 and 7.9% for G II\/13 in the other food samples. These results indicate that the bacterial treatment increase the recovery of NV from foods such as oysters, suggesting that the modified method will be useful for NV detection in food samples.","557":"A simple determination method of diphenyl (DP) and o-phenylphenol (OPP) in agricultural products by GC\/MS was examined. DP and OPP were extracted with ethyl acetate in the presence of anh. sodium sulfate. After addition of n-butanol, the extract solution was concentrated. Clean-up was achieved by shaking with graphitized bulk carbon (Supelclean ENVI-Carb). Addition of polyethylene glycol sharpened the OPP peak on GC\/MS analysis. The recoveries from 9 kinds of agricultural products spiked at 0.01 and 0.5 microg\/g each were mostly in the range of 70 to 120%, except for 50% recovery of OPP from barley spiked at 0.01 microg\/g. The quantification limits (S\/N &gt; or =10) of DP and OPP were 0.0013 and 0.005 microg\/g (0.0025 and 0.01 microg\/g in barley and soybean), respectively.","558":"A quantitative analysis method using LC\/MS\/MS of chloramphenicol (CAP) in propolis extract (ethanol extract) has been established. Extraction of CAP from propolis extract was performed by adding water, followed by salting-out with sodium chloride. Through this procedure, the wax components of propolis extract could be effectively removed. LC separation was performed with a reverse-phase column (Mightysil RP-18 GP Aqua, 2.0 mm x 150 mm, 5 microm), using 10 mmol\/L of ammonium acetate-acetonitrile (75 : 25) as a mobile phase. The flow rate was 0.2 mL\/min. Ionization was performed by electrospray ionization (ESI) in the negative mode. The detection and quantification limits of CAP in propolis extract were 0.05 and 0.15 ng\/g, respectively, and the recovery rate (spiked CAP level was 0.5 ng\/g) was 111.2%. When eight samples of propolis extract products on the market were analyzed using this method, CAP was not detected (N.D.) in any of the samples.","559":"A sensitive and quantitative multiresidue method using NCI mode GC\/MS and GC-micro ECD for determining pesticides in animal and fishery products was established. The crude sample extract obtained by acetone-hexane extraction for solid samples or acetonitrile extraction for liquid samples was cleaned up with a GPC\/SPE system. The first GPC pesticide fraction containing lipids and pigments was selectively collected, and loaded directly onto a graphitized carbon\/PSA 2-layered column. After the second GPC pesticide fraction was collected, the 2-layered column was eluted with acetone-hexane (3 : 7). The combined eluate was subjected to NCI-SIM\/Scan mode GC\/MS for semi-quantification. After fractionation by Florisil cartridge column SPE, each fraction was subjected to dual-column GC-micro ECD for quantification. Average recoveries (n=5) of pesticides, except for chlorothalonil and some others, from fortified samples ranged from 76.8% to 107.9% with RSD values of &lt;9.7%.","560":"A rapid multiresidue method was developed for determination of 98 veterinary drugs in livestock products and fish by LC\/MS\/MS. The drugs were extracted with methanol, and the extracted solution was diluted with water. The methanol concentration was adjusted to 50%, and finally the diluted solution was filtered through a microfiltration membrane (0.02 microm diameter pore size) prior to LC\/MS\/MS. Recoveries of 87 drugs from 4 foods (milk, egg, rainbow trout and cattle muscle) fortified at 0.2 microg\/g were in the range of 50-150% with a coefficient of variation (%) of less than 20%. The values obtained by this method from livestock products containing antibiotics were similar to those obtained by the official methods. This proposed method is expected to be useful as a multiresidue analysis method for screening of veterinary drugs in livestock products and fish.","561":"A husband and wife successively visited an emergency room with symptoms of staggering, slurred speech, mydriasis, and drowsiness, three hours after separately eating spaghetti with meat sauce. The sauce contained eggplant that had been grafted onto a Devil's trumpet, Datura metel. Scopolamine and atropine were detected in the leftover sauce and in the sera of the patients. This is the first case of food poisoning related to Datura in Okinawa, Japan and also might be the first report of food poisoning caused by intake of a vegetable grafted onto Datura in Japan.","562":"Organic solvent residue levels in \"Existing Food Additives\" (n=145), health food materials (n=23), and commercial health food products (n=19) were surveyed. Ethanol was the dominant solvent found in the samples, suggesting its use in the manufacturing process. Methanol, acetone, 2-propanol and ethyl acetate was also found. No residual solvent exceeded the limits set by the Food Sanitation Law.","563":"In Cambodia, fatal food poisonings associated with the consumption of pufferfish have occurred for decades, but the causative species or toxins have never been documented. Herein, we investigated the toxicity of three pufferfish species of the genus Lagocephalus collected from the coastal waters of Sihanouk Ville, one of the main regions where poisonings have occurred. L. wheeleri and L. spadiceus were non-toxic, whereas L. lunaris was toxic and all of its body tissues exhibited toxicity levels exceeding the safety limit for human consumption (10 mouse units\/g). Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was identified as the main toxin in this species; no paralytic shellfish poison(s) were detected. Consequently, we can confirm pufferfish to be a hazardous reservoir of TTX in Sihanouk Ville. It is likely that L. lunaris is one of the causative species of past pufferfish poisonings that have occurred in Cambodia.","564":"A simple method using a liquid chromatograph with a mass spectrometer has been developed for the determination of chlorophenols in food. mass spectral acquisition was performed in the negative mode by applying sungle ion monitoring. In LC separation, Cadenza CD-C18 and 10 mmol\/L ammonium acetate-methanol were used as the column and mobile phase, respectively. Chlorophenols in food were extracted with methanol, and cleaned up with an Oasis HLB cartridge. The quantification limits were 0.2 ng\/g for 4-chlorophenol, 2 ng\/g for 2,6-dichlorophenol, 1 ng\/g for 2,4-dichlorophenol and 0.5 ng\/g for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. The average rocoveries of chlorophenols from food at the spiked level of 20 ng\/g were in the range of 70-85%. The relative standard deviations of all examined compounds were within 10%.","565":"Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is a hydroxylated metabolite of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), which has been found in the milk of dairy cattle fed AFB1-contaminated feeds. Since AFM1 has been evaluated as a possible human carcinogen, the cancer risk arising from AFM1 contamination in milk is a serious problem in food safety. To evaluate the risk of AFM1 contamination in milk, it is necessary to analyze the risk factors of AFB1 contamination in corn provided for concentrated feed in Japan. The AFM1 level in domestic raw bulk milk was measured at three sampling times, January, February and June in 2004. The AFB1 contamination in corn supplied to cows was determined at the same time as the sampling of raw milk. The AFM1 contamination levels in milk in January, February and June 2004 were 0.011, 0.007 and 0.005 ng\/g, respectively. The AFB1 contamination level in the corn of the concentrated feed was higher from October of 2003 to February of 2004 than from April to June in 2004. This study provides evidence that AFM1 contamination level in milk is parallel to that of AFB1 in corn of concentrated feed, so monitoring of the AFB1 level in corn is important to prevent the risk of AFM1 contamination in milk in Japan.","566":"In order to evaluate three different methods for DNA extraction (CTAB, DNeasy Plant Mini Kit and Wizard DNA Clean-up Resin system), the yields of DNA extracted from soyproducts and the copy numbers of lectin genes amplified by quantitative PCR were compared. Fermented foods, such as miso and nattou, gave poor yields of DNA and low copy numbers with any method. However atsu-age and kinugoshi-tofu gave high-quality results with all methods. Kinako gave a high yield of DNA, but poor amplification. Boiled soybeans and soymilk showed in poor amplification. It is important to choose the appropriate DNA extraction method for each product.","567":"An extraction and analytical method was developed for determination of the content and profiles of anthocyanins in commercial dietary supplements containing blueberry extract. Dietary supplements were refluxed with hydrochloric acid-methanol solution, and spectrophotometric assay was performed to evaluate the total anthocyanidin content in extracted solutions as delphinidin, which is one of the anthocyanidins in blueberry extract. Twenty compounds (15 anthocyanins and 5 anthocyanidins) in extracted solutions were separated by HPLC analysis with gradient elution using formic acid and methanol-acetonitrile as the mobile phase, and each peak was confirmed by LC\/MS analysis. The proposed method was applied to 25 kinds of commercial dietary supplements, and one supplement whose profile was different from that of the fresh bilberry extract was found.","568":"A new test method for boric acid in agar was developed. After digestion with nitric acid, the concentration of boron was measured by ICP-AES or ICP-MS with internal standards. Collaborative studies involving 5 laboratories were conducted to evaluate the new method by using a finely powdered agar sample and a standard sample (NIST SRM SRM1570a). The repeatability and reproducibility were very good. Moreover, HORRAT(R) values were less than 2. Therefore, it was considered that the new method is acceptable for the determination of boric acid in agar.","569":"Interactions between grapefruit juice and medications have long been recognized. In recent years, several furanocoumarins (FCs) that inhibit P450 activity in intestinal microsomes have been isolated from grapefruit juice. FCs, i.e., bergamottin (BG), bergapten (BP), bergaptol (BT) and 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (DHB), in samples was extracted with acetonitrile, and separated on a Phenyl column using 0.1% phosphoric acid-acetonitrile gradient as a mobile phase, with monitoring at 311 nm. The recoveries of BG, BP, BT and DHB from lemon juice spiked at the level of 5.0 microg\/g were 103+\/-0.7%, 99.5+\/-0.2%, 96.5+\/-0.2% and 90.1+\/-0.2%, respectively. The quantification limits were 1.0 microg\/g in samples. The contents of BG, BP and DHB in grapefruit juice (n=13), citrus fruit of 20 species and health food (n=16) were measured. The contents of BG were 0-16 microg\/g, 0-16 microg\/g and 0-5.6 microg\/g, BT were 0-39 microg\/g, 0-13 microg\/g and 0-28 microg\/g, DHB were 0-10 microg\/g, 0-35 microg\/g and 0-6.2 microg\/g, respectively. BP was not detected. These results suggest that patients prescribed calcium antagonists or antiallergic agents should be cautions about their intake of FCs from grapefruit juice, citrus and health foods.","570":"A survey of Staphylococcus aureus contamination of commercial raw minced meat at 3 supermarkets in Hyogo Prefecture was conducted over a period of half a year (January to June 2006). In total, the contamination rate was 77.8% (28\/36) for beef, 91.7% (33\/36) for pork and 91.7% (33\/36) for chicken samples. In supermarket A, half or more of the positive samples had MPN values of &gt;\/=110\/g for all 3 kinds of meat samples. In supermarkets B and C, most of the positive samples were less than 46\/g for all 3 kinds of meat samples. Of the 94 isolates examined, 50 (53.2%) belonged to the human biotype, and 44 (46.8%) to animal biotypes. By coagulase typing, 64 (77.1%) of the 83 typable isolates were classified into types V (n=32) and VII (n=32). Seventeen (18.1%) of the 94 isolates produced staphylococcal enterotoxins C (n=16) and B (n=1). Pulse-field gel electrophoresis was applied for epidemiological analysis of the isolates in the 3 supermarkets. In supermarket A, the predominant type shifted during the term of the investigation. In supermarket B, the same type was isolated repeatedly from the meat throughout the investigation. In supermarket C, a variety of genotypes were detected from the meat throughout the investigation.","571":"We evaluated a multiresidue method for determination of pesticides in agricultural products by SCAN mode GC\/MS coupled with three kinds of database for 253 pesticides: relative retention time, mass spectra and calibration curve (SCAN method). Twenty-six pesticides, a total of 131 pesticides were detected in samples by the SCAN method. The detection results agreed closely with those of the SIM mode GC\/MS method using calibration standards (SIM method). The ratios of the SCAN method to the SIM method ranged from 0.3 to 3.1 with SD values of 0.63. It was judged that the SCAN method could be applied to the screening analysis of pesticide residues in agricultural products, provided that the sample preparation method makes it possible to effectively remove sample matrixes with minimal loss of analytes.","572":"A tadalafil analogue was detected in a dietary supplement marketed for tonic effect, along with hydroxyhomosildenafil and aminotadalafil. The tadalafil analogue was isolated by preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) and its structure was elucidated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS), Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The compound was determined to be methyl-1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-(chloroacetyl)-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-carboxylate.","573":"We evaluated the microbiological safety of bottled mineral water products commercially available in Japan. Of 10 bottled mineral water products manufactured in Japan, no bacteria or fungi were detected in 9 (90%), but 1 (10%) contained 1.8x10(3) colony-forming units (cfu)\/mL. Of 12 bottled mineral water products manufactured in the EU, 11 (91.7%) contained 23-3.5x10(4) cfu\/mL. On the other hand, of 5 bottled mineral water products manufactured in North America, 2 (40%) contained 2.3x10(2)-2.5x10(3) cfu\/mL. The detected microorganisms were glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli such as Brevundimonas vesicularis, Moraxella spp., and Burkholderia cepacia, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not detected in any product. For immunocompromised host patients being managed in ultra-clean rooms, the examined bottled mineral water products manufactured in Japan, except 1, were microbiologically safe.","574":"An HPLC method for determination of goosypol in feed was developed. Gossypol in food was extracted with acetic acid-water-phosphoric acid (85 : 15 : 1) for 20 min in a water bath at 100 degrees C. The extract was diluted with acetone-water (1 : 1), and injected into the HPLC. HPLC was performed with a Shodex C18M4E (4.6 mm i.d.x250 mm) column at a flow-rate of 1.0 mL\/min, using a mobile phase of methanol-water (9 : 1) adjusted to pH 2.6 with phosphoric acid, and gossypol was detected with a UV detector (254 nm). A recovery test was conducted with cottonseed spiked with gossypol at 1,000 and 5,000 mg\/kg, and with 2 kinds of formula feed spiked with gossypol at 58 and 580 mg\/kg. The mean recoveries of gossypol were 90.8-105.0% and the relative standard deviations (RSD) were within 3.0%. A collaborative study was conducted with cottonseed and formula feed spiked with gossypol at 305 mg\/kg in 8 laboratories. The average content of gossypol in cottonseed was 6,090 mg\/kg, and the repeatability and reproducibility as the relative standard deviation (RSD(r) and RSD(R)) were 3.3% and 4.4%, while the mean recovery, RSD(r) and RSD(R) of gossypol in formula feed were 87.0%, 2.7% and 5.5%, respectively.","575":"It is very important to examine the effect of non-genetically modified (non-GM) soy varieties, which constitute the matrix of the testing sample used to quantify GM soy (RRS), on the measured value of RRS by quantitative PCR methods. Therefore, we quantified the amount of RRS in powder-mixed samples containing 1 or 5% RRS prepared by using 10 different varieties of non-GM soy as the matrix. The results revealed that the measured values were not in agreement with the powder-mixing levels and that the extent of the difference depended on the variety of non-GM soy used as the matrix. The yields of DNA extracted differed among the soy varieties. On the other hand, analysis of DNA-mixed samples, that were prepared with the DNAs extracted from RRS and non-GM soy varieties, showed that the measured values of RRS were in agreement with the DNA-mixing levels. These results strongly suggest that the proportions of DNA derived from RRS and non-GM soy were not consistent with the powder-mixing ratio in the case of some non-GM soy varieties used as a matrix, resulting in the discrepancy between the measured values and the powder-mixing levels.","576":"Based on the data for pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits collected in Aichi prefecture (fiscal years 2001-2005), we selected groups of foods and pesticides that would allow efficient and effective inspection under the positive list system. Statistical analyses were done to examine the rates of detection of pesticides and the numbers of kinds of pesticides detected in samples of domestic vegetables, domestic fruits, imported vegetables, and imported fruits. The rate of detection of pesticides has decreased gradually in domestic vegetables. The number of different kinds of pesticides detected in each sample was significant higher in domestic fruits. Data for previous years were reassessed in terms of the present maximum residue limits (MRL), and classified as relative value to the MRL. The proportion of pesticides detected at levels that exceeded the MRLs showed a decreasing tendency. In addition, we were able to identify combinations of pesticides and agricultural commodities in which the MRLs were more likely to be exceeded.","577":"A chronic feeding study to evaluate the safety of genetically modified glyphosate-tolerant soybeans (GM soybeans) was conducted using F344 DuCrj rats. The rats were fed diet containing GM soybeans or Non-GM soybeans at the concentration of 30% in basal diet. Non-GM soybeans were a closely related strain to the GM soybeans. These two diets were adjusted to an identical nutrient level. In this study, the influence of GM soybeans in rats was compared with that of the Non-GM soybeans, and furthermore, to assess the effect of soybeans themselves, the groups of rats fed GM and Non-GM soybeans were compared with a group fed commercial diet (CE-2). General conditions were observed daily and body weight and food consumption were recorded. At the termination (104 weeks), animals were subjected to hematology, serum biochemistry, and pathological examinations. There were several differences in animal growth, food intake, organ weights and histological findings between the rats fed the GM and\/or Non-GM soybeans and the rats fed CE-2. However, body weight and food intake were similar for the rats fed the GM and Non-GM soybeans. Gross necropsy findings, hematological and serum biochemical parameters, and organ weights showed no meaningful difference between rats fed the GM and Non-GM soybeans. In pathological observation, there was neither an increase in incidence nor any specific type of nonneoplastic or neoplastic lesions in the GM soybeans group in each sex. These results indicate that long-term intake of GM soybeans at the level of 30% in diet has no apparent adverse effect in rats.","578":"A simple method was developed for the analysis of hyoscyamine and scopolamine in human serum and urine using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS). Hyoscyamine and scopolamine in serum and urine were cleaned up with an Oasis HLB cartridge and a PSA cartridge. The LC separation was carried out on an ODS column, using linear gradient elution with 5 mmol\/L IPCC-MS3-methanol as the mobile phase. The mass spectral acquisition was done in the positive ion mode by applying selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The recoveries of hyoscyamine and scopolamine were 86.0-105% from human serum and urine fortified at 0.2 ng\/mL and 10 ng\/mL. The detection limits of hyoscyamine and scopolamine were 0.02 ng\/mL. Four serum and three urine samples of humans poisoned by eating Datura innoxia Mill. were analyzed by this method. Hyoscyamine and scopolamine were detected at the levels of 0.45-3.5 ng\/mL in all serum samples and 170-670 ng\/mL in all urine samples.","579":"Recently we developed a novel method for estimating viable Salmonella cell numbers by means of a 5'-nuclease real-time PCR [Fujikawa et al., J. Food Hyg. Japan, 47, 151-156 (2006)]. The method was based on the increase kinetics of the target DNA region (inv A) of the microorganism growing in a culture medium during incubation. The index for the PCR was the threshold cycle. In this study, we validated the method for application in food. Namely, Salmonella cells spiked into ground chicken, pork, and beef and raw hamburger patty at various cell concentrations were cleaned up using buoyant density centrifugation and the Salmonella cell numbers were estimated with our method. Linear decreases in the threshold cycle value were observed during incubation of the samples. The standard curves for the cell number in all food samples were almost identical. With a standard curve using the mean parameter values, we successfully estimated viable Salmonella cell concentrations of the foods. The results indicate that our method is applicable for viable cell number estimation of the target microorganism in foods. Further, we used this method to study Salmonella growth in ground chicken stored at a constant temperature.","580":"","581":"","582":"","583":"A survey of pesticide residues in 490 imported cereal products on the Tokyo market from April 1994 to March 2006 was carried out. Eight kinds of organophosphorus pesticides (chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, DDVP, diazinon, etrimfos, malathion, MEP and pirimiphos-methyl) were detected at levels between Tr (below 0.01 ppm) and 0.82 ppm from 91 samples. In our investigations, chlorpyrifos-methyl and malathion tended to be detected in samples from America, pirimiphos-methyl in those from Europe, and MEP in those from Oceania. Thus, pesticide residues seemed to be different in produce from different areas. Residue levels of these pesticides were calculated as between 0.08 and 13.2% of their ADI values according to the daily intake of cereal products. Therefore, these cereal products should be safe for normal usage.","584":"A simple and rapid multiresidue method was developed for the determination of twelve quinolones (ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, difloxacin, enrofloxacin, flumequine, marbofloxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, orbifloxacin, oxolinic acid and sarafloxacin) in muscle, liver, chicken eggs, milk, prawn and rainbow trout. The quinolones were extracted from a sample with acetonitrile-water (95 : 5). A fifth part of the filtered extract was diluted with water to keep the acetonitrile ratio at ca. 60%, and passed through a C18 mini-column. The eluate was evaporated to dryness, and the residues were dissolved in methanol-water (30 : 70) for HPLC analysis. The quinolones were separated on a Inertsil ODS-3V column (4.6 mm i.d.x250 mm) with a gradient system of 0.1% phosphoric acid-acetonitrile as the mobile phase, with fluorescence detection.No interfering peak was found on the chromatograms of animal and fishery products, except for milk. The recoveries of the quinolones were over 60% from the animal and fishery products fortified at 0.1 microg\/g, and the quantification limits of the quinolones were 0.005 microg\/g. This proposed method was found to be effective and suitable for the screening of the quinolones in animal and fishery products.","585":"A simple and rapid LC\/MS method for simultaneous determination of sedecamyin (SCM) and terdecamycin (TDM) in livestock products has been developed. SCM and TDM were extracted with acetonitrile. The extract was washed with n-hexane and then evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in methanol, and injected into the LC\/MS. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. LC separation was performed on a high-pH-resistant C18 column with 10 mmol\/L carbonic acid-ammonia buffer (pH 10.0)-acetonitrile as a mobile pahse. The recoveries from swine muscle and liver fortified at the levels of 0.01 and 0.05 microg\/g were 77-88%, and those from poultry muscle and liver fortified at the levels of 0.01 and 0.3 microg\/g were 51-93%. The quantitation limits of SCM and TDM were 0.008 microg\/g and 0.005 microg\/g, respectively.","586":"A simple, sensitive and selective method with gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry (GC\/MS) and liquid chromatography\/tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) has been developed to detect 342 pesticides and veterinary drugs contaminating bovine milk at the maximum residue limits (MRLs) defined in the \"positive list system\". Sample preparation was performed by extracting the analytes with acetonitrile, followed by salting-out with sodium chloride. For some pesticides, the extract was further cleaned up by n-hexane partitioning and PSA cartridge column chromatography. GC\/MS-EI or -NCI was used to determine pesticide residues, while LC\/MS\/MS-ESI was applicable to the determination of pesticide and veterinary drug residues. The variation of the recoveries of these drugs at MRL was relatively wide; however the relative standard deviations of the recovery of each drug were within 28%, suggesting that the present method is good enough for use as a screening test for contaminants at the MRLs. These results show that this method is useful for multiresidue analysis of numerous pesticides and veterinary drugs in bovine milk.","587":"A method for the determination of hymexazol in agricultural produdcts by gas chromatography with a highly sensitive nitrogen-phosphorus detector (GC-NPD) was investigated. Hymexazol was extracted with acetonitrile, and the acetonitrile layer was separated by salting-out. The water layer was loaded onto a Chem-Elut column. Hymexazol in the water layer was adsorbed on the column, and eluted with ethyl acetate. The acetonitrile layer and the eluate were mixed and evaporated. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate, and the sample solution was cleaned up on a C18 column. Hymexazol in the eluate was analyzed by GC-NPD with a high-polarity capillary column (DB-FFAP) and highly deactivated inlet liner. Recoveries of hymexazol spiked in agricultural products (tomato, lemon, soybean and other samples) at the level of 0.1 mug\/g ranged from 65.0 to 84.7%. The limit of detection was 0.02microg\/g.","588":"A simple preprocessing method was developed for multiresidue determination of pesticides in processed agricultural products. Residues were extracted from homogenized samples with acetonitrile in a glass centrifuge tube, followed by salting-out and partitioning with n-hexane. Co-extractives were removed by means of mini-column clean up. Analysis was performed by GC\/MS and LC\/MS\/MS. The prepared sample solutions were examined for matrix effects. Matrix effects had both positive and negative effects on quantitative value. Calibration was achieved by preparing matrix-matched calibration standards to counteract the matrix effects. Of the 235 pesticides spiked at 0.05 or 0.10 microg\/g (Method GC), 0.025 or 0.05 microg\/g (Method LC) into 8 foods (garlic paste, diced green sweet pepper, green peas paste, celery paste, sweet potato paste, dried adzuki beans, boiled bamboo shoots, tomato paste), recoveries of 214 pesticides were between 50 and 100% and the coefficient of variation was below 20%. This method is useful as a multi-residue analysis method for screening of pesticides in foods.","589":"A sensitive and selective method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) for the determination of nitrofurazone (NFZ) in swine muscle, swine liver, chicken muscle, chicken liver, egg, eel, yellowtail and shrimp has been developed. The drug was extracted with 0.2% metaphosphoric acid-methanol (6 : 4), and the extracts were cleaned up on an Oasis HLB cartridge (200 mg). The extracts were analyzed by LC-MS\/MS using electrospray ionizationin the negative ion mode. The LC separation was performed on a Hypersil Gold C18 column (15 cmx2.1 mm i.d.) with a gradient system of 0.01% formic acid-acetonitrile as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL\/min. The quantitative and confirmatory determination of NFZ was performed by selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The calibration graph for NFZ was rectilinear from 0.2 to 100 ng\/mL with SRM. The recoveries of NFZ from samples fortified at 1 and 10 ng\/g were 79.6-106.8%, and quantification limit was 0.2 ng\/g for the drug. This is well below the detection limit (1 ng\/g) set by the Japanese Food Sanitation Law.","590":"An efficient clean-up procedure was developed for the trace residue determination of tetracyclines (TCs) in dark-colored honeys. TCs were extracted from samples with McIlvaine buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.01 mol\/L Na(2)EDTA. The extracts were treated with both a polymeric cartridge (GL-Pak PLS-2) and a metal chelate affinity column (MCAC) preloaded with copper(II). TCs were eluted and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using fluorescence detection. The method was evaluated for the determination of oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline (TC), and chlortetracycline (CTC) in buckwheat honey, because its color is the darkest. The mean recoveries of OTC, TC and CTC from spiked samples, at three fortification levels, were &gt;70%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were &lt;10%. Limits of quantitation (LOQs) of OTC, TC, and CTC were estimated to be 0.015 mg\/kg, 0.019 mg\/kg, and 0.024 mg\/kg, respectively.","591":"A multiresidue method was developed for determination of nine aminoglycoside antibiotics (streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, spectinomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, destomycin A, apramycin, and tobramycin) in milk by LC\/MS\/MS. The drugs were extracted with 0.01 mol\/L potassium dihydrogen phosphate containing 2% trichloroacetic acid, and the extracted solution was cleaned on cation-exchange cartridge columns (Oasis WCX and Oasis MCX). LC separation was performed on a TSK-gel VMpak25 column (50 mmx2.0 mm i.d.) using gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. Recoveries of the drugs spiked at 0.01 or 0.1 microg\/g in milk ranged from 66.1 to 110.8%, with a coefficient of variation of less than 17.1%. Limits of quantification of the drugs in milk were 0.001 approximately 0.01 microg\/g. This method was used for analysis of milk from a lactating cow treated for clinical mastitis with two intramammary infusions of kanamycin (KM). Milk samples were analyzed during the withdrawal times at 12-hour intervals. KM concentrations were lower than the Japanese provisional MRLs (0.4 microg\/g) at 60 hours after infusion, and subsequently fell to 0.01 microg\/g.","592":"A simultaneous determination of veterinary drugs in livestock food and seafood using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) was developed. Veterinary drugs were extracted with 95% acetonitrile. The solution was passed through a Florisil column, and the solvent was replaced with phosphate buffer. The extract was charged on a Sep-Pak Plus C(18) mini-column and divided into 40% methanol eluate fraction and 70% acetonitrile eluate fraction. Test solutions were analyzed by LC\/MS\/MS with gradient elution. By using this method, 37 kinds of veterinary drugs were obtained with over 60% recovery, and quantitation was possible in cattle muscle, egg and fish. This method was inapplicable to 28 kinds of veterinary drugs. Although quantitation was not achieved, 42 other kinds of veterinary drugs can be screened. Since the limit of quantitation for this method is less than the provisional limit in general, it is useful as a screening method in residual analysis of veterinary drugs.","593":"A simple and rapid screening method using bioassay for the simultaneous analysis of antibacterials (penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, tetracyclines, quinolones, etc.) in meat has been developed. A 5 g sample was homogenized with 5 mL of methanol, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min with 3,000 rpm. The pulp disk method with Bacillus subtilis BGA (Antibiotic Medium 5 (pH 8) and 8 (pH 6)), Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 and Geobacillus stearothermophilus as test organisms was employed for the assay of the antibacterials. Typical antibacterials (penicillin G, ampicillin, cefapirin, cefalexin, erythromycin, spiramycin, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, enrofloxacin and oxolinic acid) were detected at levels of ca. 0.005-2.5 microg\/g in meat. Therefore, we recommend this proposed screening method for routine analysis of residual antibacterials in livestock products.","594":"The effects of processing and cooking on the levels of pesticide residues in soybean samples were investigated for 14 pesticides in pre-harvest samples. On soaking, the transfer ratios (%, total pesticide residue amount in product\/that in soybean) of soaked soybean were greater than 60% for most of the pesticides investigated. The transfer ratio of soymilk ranged from 37% to 92%, and that of tofu ranged from 7% to 63%. The processing factor (Pf, the concentration (mg\/kg) of pesticide in product\/that in soybean) of tofu ranged from 0.026 to 0.28. These values varied among pesticides. There was a high correlation between the log P(ow) and the transfer ratio of tofu. The test described here should be useful to obtain the transfer ratios of pesticide residues in processing and\/or cooking steps.","595":"The effects of processing and cooking on the levels of pesticide residues in wheat samples were investigated for 13 pesticides in pre-harvest (Pre, 9 pesticides) and post-harvest (Post, 6 pesticides) samples. In the milling process, the transfer ratios (%, total pesticide residue amount in product\/that in wheat grain) of wheat bran were greater than 70% and 80% for pre-harvest and post-harvest samples, respectively. The transfer ratios of flour ranged from 1.7% to 23% (Pre) and 4.0% to 11% (Post). There was no significant difference in transfer ratio among the pesticides investigated. The processing factors (Pf, the concentration (mg\/kg) of pesticide in product\/that in the wheat grain) of flour ranged from 0.030 to 0.40 (Pre) and 0.069 to 0.18 (Post). The values in pre-harvest samples were higher than those in post-harvest samples. Investigation of changes of pesticide residues during processing and\/or cooking is useful not only to establish MRLs, but also to recognize actual levels of pesticide residues in food.","596":"The effects of processing and cooking on the levels of pesticide residues in rice samples were investigated for 11 pesticides in pre-harvest (9 pesticides) and post-harvest (4 pesticides) samples. In the polishing process, the transfer ratio (%, total pesticide residue amount in product\/that in brown rice) of rice bran ranged from 40% to 106%, and the transfer ratio of polished rice ranged from 9% to 65% in pre-harvest samples. These values varied from pesticide to pesticide. The processing factor (the concentration (mg\/kg) of pesticide in product\/that in the brown rice) of polished rice ranged from 0.11 to 0.73. The loss of pesticides during processing and\/or cooking did not correlate to any single physical or chemical property. Investigation of changes of pesticide residues during processing and\/or cooking is useful not only to establish MRLs, but also to recognize actual levels of pesticide residues in food.","597":"A simplified method for the determination of benzylaminopurine in agricultural products by LC\/MS was investigated. Benzylaminopurine in agricultural products was extracted with acetone and the extract was concentrated to below 30 mL. Buffer solution of pH 9.0 and ethyl acetate were added to the residue, and the solution was shaken. The ethyl acetate layer was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in acetone-n-hexane (1 : 1). The solution was applied to a SAX\/PSA mini-column, which was then rinsed with acetone-n-hexane (1 : 1). Benzylaminopurine was eluted with acetone-n-hexane (1 : 1) containing 1% water. The eluates were evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in 10 mmol\/L ammonium acetate-methanol (1 : 1). Benzylaminopurine was analyzed by LC\/MS. The MS detection was performed in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, with detection of the M+H(+) ion of benzylaminopurine (m\/z 226) generated by electrospray ionization (ESI). Recoveries of benzylaminopurine from 15 agricultural products were in the range of 83.1-97.2%. The limits of detection (S\/N=3) of benzylaminopurine in all samples except green tea and in green tea were 0.0003 and 0.0012 microg\/g, respectively.","598":"A rapid analytical method for the simultaneous determination of carbamate pesticides in processed foods was established by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS). The pesticides were extracted from samples with acetonitrile using accelerated solvent extract equipment, except for the fine powder type spices, which were extracted in an ultrasonic bath. The crude extract was cleaned up with a multi-solvent GPC column (Shodex Asahipak GF-310 HQ) using acetonitrile as a mobile phase. The eluent from the column at the retention time between 13 to 18 min was concentrated under nitrogen gas and dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile-water-0.2 mol\/L ammonium formate buffer pH 6.0 (10 : 9 : 1). An aliquot was injected into the LC\/MS\/MS using electrospray ionization (ESI) with acquisition in the positive mode. The recoveries of 29 kinds of pesticide from dried fruits (raisin, prune and mango) and spices (turmeric, masala, sage, thyme and red pepper) fortified at levels of 0.1 and 0.01 microg\/g were mostly in the range of 50 to 150% and those from soybean paste and soy sauce fortified at 0.01 microg\/g were 46.9 to 122.6% (C.V. 3.8 to 37.6%), except for 4 kinds of pesticide. The determination limits (S\/N&gt; or =10) corresponded to 0.001 to 0.05 mug\/g of the pesticides in red pepper.","599":"Inoculation tests of Staphylococcus aureus were performed to evaluate the risk of toxic hazard in cheese manufacturing processes. S. aureus was inoculated into pasteurized milk or cheese curd, and the survival and growth were examined. S. aureus grew only slightly or decreased in cell number under the manufacturing condition of semi-hard type cheese or soft-type cheese. Under the conditions of the fresh cheese making process, S. aureus slightly increased in cell number, though no enterotoxin was detected. In processed cheese, S. aureus did not grow at all. Growth inhibition of S. aureus by lactic acid produced from starter culture was suggested to be the cause of growth inhibition in the natural cheese.","600":"Ochratoxin A (OTA), ochratoxin B (OTB) and citrinin (CIT) in commercial foods were simultaneously determined and confirmed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS). The samples examined were made up of cereal, fruit, coffee, and cacao products. The limits of quantification (S\/N&gt; or =10) of OTA, OTB and CIT were 0.1 microg\/kg or less. Aflatoxins (AF), deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins were also surveyed. Of 157 samples examined, 44 were contaminated with OTA at levels of 0.11 to 4.0 microg\/kg. At least 2 positive samples were labeled as domestics. In most positive samples, the OTA level was low, less than 1 microg\/kg. The highest incidence of OTA was observed in cacao powder (10\/12), followed by instant coffee (5\/7), cocoa (5\/8) and raisin (6\/13). OTB was found in fruit and cacao products containing relatively high levels of OTA. Co-occurrence of OTA, CIT and DON was found in cereal products, and co-occurrence of OTA and AF was found in cacao products. Approximately 30% of naturally contaminated OTA in roasted coffee bean moved into the extract solution when brewed with paper filter.","601":"Mold species that grew on the surface of retailed strawberries (10 packs, 211 strawberries) and cherries (18 packs, 441 cherries) during storage at 25 degrees C were isolated and identified to evaluate the state of mold growth. Mold growth was observed on 208 (98.6%) of the 211 strawberries and 193 (43.8%) of the 441 cherries. The mold species most frequently isolated from strawberries was Botrytis cinerea, being observed in 81.0% of the strawberries examined, followed by Cladosporium and Alternaria alternata. The mold most frequently isolated from cherries was Alternaria (28.7%), followed by Penicillium, Botrytis, and Cladosporium. The frequency of cherries on which mold growth was observed varied among packs. Mold tended to grow more often in the areas of the fruits in contact with adjacent fruits.","602":"Methods using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FL) and using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) were developed for simultaneous determination of ochratoxin A (OTA), ochratoxin B (OTB) and citrinin (CIT) in cereal, fruit, and coffee products. The samples were extracted with ethyl acetate under an acidic condition, and then cleaned up with liquid-liquid separation. The test solutions were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC-FL and LC\/MS\/MS. Mass spectral acquisition was performed in positive ion mode by applying multiple reaction monitoring. The performances of both detectors were almost equivalent. The recoveries of OTA and OTB were 87-111%, and that of CIT were 70-88%. The limits of quantification (S\/N&gt; or =10) of OTA, OTB and CIT was 0.1 mug\/kg or less. These methods were considered to be useful for the determination of the three mycotoxins at low levels (0.1 microg\/kg).","603":"Arsenic (As) uptake in human occurs via the food chain mainly. The Joint FAO\/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has established the provisional tolerable weekly intake level for As as an inorganic As (iAs) value, because iAs in food is much more toxic than organic As. In this study, we studied an acid based partial-digestion method for the complete extraction of arsenicals from rice. HPLC\/ICP-MS was used to determine the concentration of iAs selectively. The conditions adopted to extract arsenicals from a 0.5 g of finely ground rice sample were addition of 2 mL of 0.15 mol\/L nitric acid and heating at 80 degrees C for 2 hr. The LOD and LOQ for iAs were 0.0024 and 0.0079 mg\/kg dry weight, respectively. Recovery studies showed good accuracy. When the method was applied to ten short-grain brown rice samples, the iAs concentrations were 0.108-0.227 mg\/kg dry weight and the total As concentrations were 0.118-0.260 mg\/kg dry weight. Although dimethylarsinic acid was also detected in most samples, the percentage of iAs content in total As content was 62.2-96.3%. Thus, iAs was the principal As species in the short-grain brown rice samples tested.","604":"Because there is a great difference between the toxicity of inorganic arsenic (As) and organic As in food, the JECFA has set a PTWI value for inorganic As (iAs) rather than for total As. The difference in As toxicity makes it necessary to extract iAs completely from food samples for toxicological analysis, but complete extraction of As from most foods including seaweed has not been achieved to date. We developed a partial-digestion method that uses nitric acid as a solvent in order to extract almost all arsenicals from the solid matrix of hijiki (Hizikia fusiforme, a brown alga) samples. In this method, organic As species were not converted into iAs. HPLC\/ICP-MS was then used to determine the concentration of iAs. Total As was measured by hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry. The adopted conditions for 0.1 g of ground fine powder sample were: 2 mL of 0.3 mol\/L nitric acid; heating, 80 degrees C for 1 hr. Intra-laboratory validation of the method showed good precision and accuracy. The repeatability and intermediate precision for iAs were 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. The LOD and LOQ for iAs were 0.14 and 0.46 mg\/kg dry weight, respectively. Recovery studies performed by spiking 0.5 mg\/kg dry weight as the LOQ level and by spiking 3 mg\/kg dry weight as the iAs concentration of an un-spiked hijiki sample showed good accuracy. The method was applied to hijiki samples after a water soaking process and a water soaking and simmering process. The results suggested that the As concentration in hijiki after both processes was lower than that before the treatments and that the water soaking and simmering process reduced the iAs concentration much more effectively than the water soaking process.","605":"Comparative sequence analysis was performed on the 18S rRNA gene (1,676 bp), 26\/28S rRNA gene D2 region (321 bp) and lys2 (997 bp) to evaluate the gene index for rapid, accurate and convenient identification of Byssochlamys spp. and related species. The results showed that 26 strains (11 species) of the clade could be identified or grouped by means of each gene sequence. The highest resolution to discriminate these species was observed with lys2, but 26\/28S rRNA gene D2 region was considered to be the best index for convenient identification. In addition, phylogenetic analysis based on these genes indicated that genus Byssochlamys is not monophyletic, although species in the clade are closely related to each other. Re-classification will be necessary, based on detailed morphological observations.","606":"A simple method for the simultaneous determination of four aconitine analogues (AC; aconitine, HA; hypaconitine, MA; mesaconitine, JA; jesaconitine) in Aconitum plants (Aconitum subcuneatum NAKAI) and a food that caused food poisoning was developed, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS). Aconitine analogues were extracted with 1 mmol\/L HCl and then cleaned up with an Oasis HLB cartridge. The LC separation was performed with an octadecylated silica column (Develosil ODS-HG-5, 2.0 mm i.d. x 50 mm) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL\/min, using A solution (5 mmol\/L ammonium acetate dissolved in 0.1% acetic acid) and B solution (acetonitrile-THF=1 : 3), 90%A (0 min)--&gt;60%A (15 min)--&gt;const. (2 min). Mass spectral acquisition was performed in the positive mode and the analogues were targeted using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with electrospray ionization (ESI). The recoveries of aconitine analogues were 93-99% from Aconitum plants. The detection limits of AC, HA, MA and JA were 0.4, 0.4, 0.3 and 0.5 ng\/g, respectively. The aconitine analogues, except JA, were detected in food that caused food poisoning at the level of 2.6-29.7 microg\/g. These results indicate that the developed method is suitable for the determination of aconitine analogues in Aconitum plants and foods that cause food poisoning.","607":"Contamination of spices with pathogens has been reported worldwide, and Salmonella might result in foodborne infections. In this study, we investigated the survival of Salmonella in black pepper and red pepper, and the growth of the surviving Salmonella in cooked food. Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Weltevreden and Salmonella Senftenberg were inoculated into spices, and their survival during storage was examined. In black pepper, S. Enteritidis was no longer viable after storage for 28 days, but S. Weltevreden and S. Senftenberg remained viable. In red pepper, S. Weltevreden and S. Senftenberg survived for 28 days although S. Enteritidis was not viable after 7 days. Salmonella Weltevreden and Salmonella Senftenberg were inoculated into cooked food, and their survival during storage was determined. In potato salad, egg salad, namul and kimchi as cooked foods, both pathogens grew at 30 degrees C, but not at 10 degrees C. Our results indicate that cooked food should be stored at low temperature after addition of spices, such as black pepper and red pepper, following the cooking.","608":"Genetically modified (GM) papaya has not yet been approved for importation into, or cultivation in the European Union (EU) and Japan. A DNA extraction method using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (PM method) and a method using a buffer containing cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB method) have been adopted as the official Japanese methods for detecting GM foods. However, the amounts of DNA extracted from papaya by these methods are very low. Therefore, we investigated an extraction method to obtain a high yield of DNA from raw or freeze-dried fresh papaya using the Promega Wizard DNA Clean-Up Resin System (WCR). The incubation for the extraction was carried out at 58 degrees C without proteinase K for 15 min. The extract was applied to a mini-column, then the column was washed with 80% isopropyl alcohol, and genomic DNA adsorbed on the column was eluted with TE buffer. The WCR method gave a higher yield of genomic DNA, and was simpler and faster than the PM method or CTAB method. In addition, it could be used to extract genomic DNA from fresh papaya at various stages of ripeness. Based on these results, we propose that the present method using WCR is the most practical and useful way to extract genomic DNA for the purpose of detecting GM papaya.","609":"","610":"","611":"","612":"Grapefruit seed extract (GSE), derived from the seeds of grapefruit (Citrus paradisi MCAF.), is listed as a natural food additive in Japan. Products containing GSE are used as disinfectants made from only natural sources, especially after Japanese researchers found that GSE prevents the growth of norovirus. On the other hand, recent overseas studies indicated that synthetic disinfectants, such as benzalkonium and benzethonium chlorides, were present in some commercial GSE products. To confirm the quality of commercial GSE products available in Japanese markets, we carried out comprehensive research to identify the major constituents of commercial GSE products which are used as food additives (13 products from 6 manufacturers), dietary supplements (5 products from 4 manufacturers), cosmetic materials (16 products from 10 manufacturers) and disinfectant or deodorant sprays (7 products from 7 manufacturers). By means of NMR and LC\/MS analysis, synthetic disinfectants such as benzethonium or benzalkonium salts were detected in most of the commercial GSE products.","613":"In order to determine the tolerable upper intake level of folic acid in humans, we investigated the effects of excessive folic acid administration on the body weight gain, food intake, tissue weight, and metabolism of B-group vitamins in weaning rats. The rats were freely fed ordinary diet containing 0.0002% folic acid (control diet) or the same diet with 0.01%, 0.1%, or 1.0% folic acid for 29 days. The body weight gains and food intakes did not differ among the four groups. Diarrhea was not seen even in the 1.0% group. Excess folic acid did not affect the tissue weights of the brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, or testis, or urinary excretion of other B-group vitamins. These results clearly showed that feeding a diet containing up to 1.0% folic acid did not affect the food intake, body weight gain, tissue weight, or urinary excretion of B-group vitamins in weaning rats.","614":"The yield of genomic DNA extracted from corn-processed foods, such as corn flake and one of the corn snack what is called \"Jumbo corn\", using an ion-exchange resin type kit (Gtip) has been reported to be very low, and it is thought to be difficult to detect the intrinsic corn gene \"Zein\" in the foods. Therefore, we developed a new method using Gtip, which we called the \"KNG-Gtip method,\" by modification of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) method using Gtip (MHLW-Gtip method). We compared the KNG-Gtip method, MHLW-Gtip method, the Gtip method for detection of allergen (ALG-Gtip method), and the Gtip method according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) (JAS-Gtip method) in terms of the yield and quality of genomic DNA and the detection probabilities of the PCR-amplified Zein gene. The concentrations of DNA and the detection probabilities of the PCR-amplified Zein gene of genomic DNA extracted from 4 g corn flake and 4 g Jumbo corn by the KNG-Gtip method were larger than those by using the conventional methods. In addition, the PCR-amplified Zein gene from 4 g of corn starch could be detected by the KNG-Gtip method. We propose that the KNG-Gtip method, in which requires sample weight of four grams, is practical and useful to extract genomic DNA from corn flake and Jumbo corn.","615":"A rapid and precise determination residues of 4 tetracyclines (TCs) (oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline (TC), chlortetracycline (CTC) and doxycycline (DOXY)) in meat was developed by employing three analyses; a microbiological screening, HPLC and LC\/MS\/MS. TCs were extracted with pH 4.0 McIlvaine buffer containing 0.01 mol\/L EDTA from a meat sample, and then purified using a mixed mode, reversed-phase and cation-exchange cartridge. The mean recoveries (n=5) of 0.2 microg\/g OTC, TC and CTC, 0.05 microg\/g DOXY spiked in meat samples were 76.6-99.0% (C.V. 1.6-5.4%). In 13 meat samples in which the microbiological screening indicated the presence of TCs, CTC (9 samples) and DOXY (4 samples) were identified with HPLC and LC\/MS\/MS.","616":"Simultaneous determination of three artificial sweeteners, neotame (NE), alitame (AL) and aspartame (APM) in various foods by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed. Chopped or homogenized samples were packed into cellulose tubing with 0.01 mol\/L hydrochloric acid containing 10% sodium chloride, and dialyzed against 0.01 mol\/L hydrochloric acid for 24-48 hours. The dialyzate was passed through an Oasis MCX cartridge, and the cartridge was washed with water and methanol. Then the three sweeteners were eluted from the cartridge with a mixture of 0.5 mol\/L ammonium chloride-acetonitrile (3 : 2). The sweeteners were separated on a Cosmosil 5C18-AR column using a gradient mode with a mobile phase of 0.01 mol\/L phosphate buffer (pH 4.0)-acetonitrile and were detected at 210 nm. The recoveries of NE, AL and APM from 8 kinds of foods spiked with 10 and 100 microg\/g were 86-100% and 89-104%, respectively. The detection limits of NE, AL and APM were 1 microg\/g in samples. Furthermore, the three sweeteners were successfully identified by using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.","617":"A nested PCR method was developed for the detection of DNAs extracted from allergenic substances (here, wheat) in food. Because of DNA fragmentation, detection of wheat-specific DNA extracted from food, such as retort pouch food, is very difficult. Therefore, to improve the sensitivity of detection, a nested PCR primer pair (Wtr01NE2-5' and Wtr10NE5-3': amplicon size 97 bp) was newly designed within the region of the PCR products amplified by the official Japanese primer pair (Wtr01-5' and Wtr10-3'; amplicon size 141 bp) for wheat. Genomic DNAs of seven kinds of commercial processed foods containing wheat, wheat flour and three kinds of wheat flours pressure-heated at 100, 121 and 131 degrees C were extracted with a commercial ion-exchange type kit by modifying the Japanese official method. The nested PCR method involved two PCR procedures. First, PCR was performed by varying both the PCR reagents and cycling conditions of the Japanese official method. Second, PCR was performed using the first PCR products diluted 200-fold with TE buffer. The Japanese official method enabled detection of only four of the seven kinds of foods and three of the four kinds of flours (one sample was just a trace), while the nested PCR method detected all seven foods and all four flours. Investigation of the detectability of the four kinds of wheat flours depending on the size of the amplified fragment using five primer pairs showed that its size must be kept to less than approximately 100 bp. The nested PCR method significantly improved the sensitivity of detection of wheat-specific DNA.","618":"A real-time PCR detection method was developed for event-specific quantitation of Roundup Ready maize, GA21. The developed PCR method was designed to amplify an artificial junction site between the native maize genome DNA and the recombinant DNA of GA21 maize, which provides only one target sequence per haploid of GA21 genome. Thus, the amplification efficiency of the event-specific target for GA21 became closely similar to the amplification of SSIIb, and the conversion factor (Cf) for the quantitation method was similar to the theoretical value. The developed method demonstrated better performance than the existing construct-specific method that has been used as a Japanese official method. The developed method can easily be combined with the real-time PCR targeting of the CaMV35S promoter, and the multiplexed method should be an effective screening method for GM maize.","619":"Caulerpa lentillifera is a kind of edible seaweed, known as 'sea grape' or 'green caviar'. It is used in fresh salads. However, it is sensitive to low temperature and osmotic pressure, and is easily spoilt by storage in a refrigerator or washing with tap water. That is the reason why it is difficult to prevent food poisoning, especially due to Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In this study we investigated of marine bacteria and V. parahaemolyticus in C. lentillifera and cultured them in order to develop effective control of bacteria in commercial farms. The sixteen farms in the Okinawa Islands were investigated from August to September in 2006. A total of 176 samples were collected from eleven points during the cultivation processes and from the products. About 10(3) cfu\/mL of marine bacteria were detected in the seawater used in the tank culture, but after cultivation of C. lentillifera the number had increased to about 10(6) cfu\/mL. The number of marine bacteria in C. lentillifera did not change significantly through the process of planting to the final product (about 10(7) cfu\/g). V. parahaemolyticus was detected in seawater from all processes and C. lentillifera was isolated from 56% of seawater, 25% of seed-stocks, and 18.8% of product samples, though but thermostable direct hemolysin gene was not detected from enrichment cultures or isolated V. parahaemolyticus strains. These results indicate that for prevention of food poisoning by V. parahaemolyticus in C. lentillifera, it is important to establish a suitable sterilization procedure for each process.","620":"","621":"","622":"","623":"","624":"","625":"","626":"2-Alkylcyclobutanones, such as 2-dodecylcyclobutanone and 2-tetradecylcyclobutanone, were analyzed to assess the irradiation history of irradiated meats or fish, and cooked foods with irradiated ingredients, which had been stored frozen for up to one year. The purpose of the study was to show that irradiated meats could be detected even after having been stored in the distribution system. 2-Alkylcyclobutanones showed a small decrease in irradiated raw meats that had been stored frozen for one year. Cooked foods, such as pancake and fried chicken made with irradiated eggs and chicken, respectively, contained detectable levels of 2-alkylcyclobutanones after storage frozen for one year. The 2-alkylcyclobutanones became undetectable in highly dried samples, such as feed for lab animals, during the same period.","627":"We tested for four kinds of allergic substances (egg, milk, wheat and peanuts) in 52 imported processed foods using immunochromatographic test kits (ITK). ELISA was also employed to confirm the effectiveness of the ITK. Among 92 data from 23 samples, allergic substances were detected in 9 cases with one kind of ITK, but not with the ELISA test. Among 116 data from 29 samples, 6 were negative with one kind of ITK and but positive with the other ITK. These results suggested that these 4 kinds of allergic substances in imported foods can be detected by using a double-check method with two kinds of ITK.","628":"A survey of pesticide residues in 316 baby foods on the Tokyo market from April 1999 to June 2005 was carried out. Fifteen kinds of pesticides, including organophosphorus, organochlorine, carbamate, pyrethroid and others, were detected between at levels Tr (below 0.01 ppm) and 0.55 ppm from 28 samples. The baby foods in which residual pesticides were detected were produced from flour, leaf vegetable and fruits. The pesticides were detected in baby foods produced with minimal processing, such as straining and squeezing. For the baby foods containing pesticides, the amounts of intake of the pesticides were calculated from the recommended servings, and compared with the ADI values. Residual pesticide levels in baby food were between 0.06 and 16.6% of the ADI. Therefore, these foods should be safe in normal usage.","629":"The differences in the constituents of ten ester-type gum bases used as natural food additives in Japan (urushi wax, carnauba wax, candelilla wax, rice bran wax, shellac wax, jojoba wax, bees wax, Japan wax, montan wax, and lanolin) were investigated. Several kinds of gum bases showed characteristic TLC patterns of lipids. In addition, compositions of fatty acid and alcohol moieties of esters in the gum bases were analyzed by GC\/MS after methanolysis and hydrolysis, respectively. The results indicated that the varieties of fatty acids and alcohols and their compositions were characteristic for each gum base. These results will be useful for identification and discrimination of the ester-type gum bases.","630":"We developed a specific method to extract DNA from rice grain samples and modified the qualitative real-time PCR method provided by Bayer Co., Ltd. for reliable detection of the genetically modified (GM) rice variety, LLRice601, which has not undergone safety assessment for regulatory approval in Japan. Moreover, we conducted a data analysis to confirm the results obtained with real-time PCR. The yields of DNA extracted from powdered samples of rice grains were almost equal among 5 different varieties of rice, and there was no significant difference in the yield over three days. Reliable results were obtained using 50 ng of the extracted DNA as the template for real-time PCR. To examine the adequacy of the methods, we organized an interlaboratory study with the participation of 2 laboratories, in which 80 test samples were analyzed in a blinded manner. The statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the Ct value for the endogenous gene of the DNA samples and for the targeted DNA sequence of 0.1% samples. The limit of detection of the method was approximately 0.1%. Analysis of the fluorescence intensity of the PCR-amplified product of the construct-specific DNA sequence suggested that it may be reasonable to judge a sample as positive when a Ct value of less than 40 is obtained.","631":"A simultaneous determination method of saccharin (SA), sorbic acid (SOA), benzoic acid (BA), p-hydroxybenzoic acid ethyl (PHBA-Et), p-hydroxybenzoic acid isopropyl (PHBA-isoPr), p-hydroxybenzoic acid propyl (PHBA-Pr), p-hydroxybenzoic acid isobutyl (PHBA-isoBu) and p-hydroxybenzoic acid butyl (PHBA-Bu) in foods by HPLC was examined. A mixture of acetonitrile-water (1:1) was used to extract these additives from foods excluding liquid foods, while acetonitrile was used to extract them from liquid foods. HPLC was performed using a TSKgel ODS80Ts (4.6 mm i.d. x 150 mm) column with a mobile phase of 0.01% formic acid solution containing 2 mmol\/L-di-n-butyl (or amyl) ammonium acetate (A) and acetonitrile (B) under the following conditions: A\/B = 8: 2 (0-8 min) --&gt; 6: 4 (15-32 min). Recoveries of these additives spiked in foods were 78-120%. The determination limits were 10 microg\/g.

However, whether the fin is edible or not is determined for convenience from the toxicity of skin, since little information is available about the toxicity of puffer fish fins. In the present study, we examined the toxicity of fins and skin of three toxic species, Takifugu vermicularis, T. snyderi, and T. porphyreus. The toxicity of T. vermicularis fins (&lt; 5-52.4 MU\/g) was significantly lower than that of skin (&lt;5-1200 MU\/g). HPLC analysis showed that tetrodotoxin was a major toxic principle irrespective of the toxicity value in each tissue of T. vermicularis. In the case of T. snyderi and T. porphyreus, the toxicity of fins was at almost the same level as that of the skin. The toxicity (&lt; 10-12 MU\/g) of caudal fins of T. porphyreus was apparently increased to 16.5-22.0 MU\/g by drying. However, the toxin amounts in the dried fins were slightly decreased as compared with those of the non-dried fins. These results demonstrate that puffer fish with toxic skin also have toxic fins.","641":"A simple and rapid multi-residue method was developed for the determination of 28 kinds of veterinary drugs and feed additives (drugs) in muscle of cattle, pig and chicken. The drugs were extracted with acetonitrile-water (95:5) in a homogenizer and ultrasonic generator. The extracted solution was poured into an alumina column and the drugs were eluted with acetonitrile-water (90:10). The eluate was washed with n-hexane saturated with acetonitrile and then evaporated. The drugs were separated on a Inertsil ODS-3V column (4.6 mm i.d. x 250 mm) with a gradient system of 0.1% phosphoric acid-acetonitrile as the mobile phase, with monitoring at 280 and 340 nm. The recoveries of the 26 kinds of drugs were over 60% from the meats fortified at 0.1 microg\/g, and the quantification limits of most drugs were 0.01 microg\/g. This proposed method was found to be effective and suitable for the screening of the above drugs in meats.","642":"A simplified method for the determination of forchlorfenuron in agricultural products by HPLC with UV detection was investigated. A chopped sample homogenate from agricultural products was extracted with acetone. The extract was filtrated and concentrated. The residues was loaded onto a Chem Elut column and extracted with ethyl acetate. The crude extract was purified on Oasis HLB and Bond Elut PSA mini-columns using a mixture of methanol and ethyl acetate. Forchlorfenuron was analyzed by HPLC with UV detection (263 nm). HPLC separation was performed on an ODS column with methanol-water as the mobile phase. Recoveries of forchlorfenuron from several agricultural products fortified at the level of 0.1 microg\/g were in the range of 87.6-99.5%. The limit of detection (S\/N=3) was 0.005 microg\/g in the sample.","643":"Simple and reliable methods using LC\/MS have been developed for the determination of the beta-agonist ractopamine in swine and cattle tissues. Ractopamine was extracted with ethyl acetate from muscle and liver, and the ethyl acetate layer was evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by partition with acetonitrile\/n-hexane. In the case of fat, ractopamine was extracted and purified by partition with acetonitrile\/n-hexane. The resulting acetonitrile solutions were evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in methanol, and subjected to LC\/MS. The LC separation was performed on a Wakosil-II 3C18HG column (150 x 3 mm i.d.) in isocratic mode with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid-acetonitrile (80:20) as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 mL\/min. The MS detection was performed in the selected ion recording (SIR) mode, with detection of the M + H+ ion of ractopamine (m\/z 302) produced by electrospray ionization (ESI). The mean recoveries of the drug from swine muscle (0.01 microg fortified), fat (0.01 microg fortified) and liver (0.04 microg\/g fortified) were 99.7%, 99.5% and 100.8%, and those from cattle samples were 108.3%, 97.0% and 109.4%, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 0.1% to 9.5%.

Pesticides were extracted with ethyl acetate together with phosphoric acid and anhydrous sodium sulfate, followed by an ENVI-Carb cartridge cleanup. Phosphoric acid prevented BRP from being converted to DDVP during extraction of pesticides from the sample. When the sample was dissolved in acetonitrile in a silanized glass vial, BRP and DEP remained intact. Mass spectral acquisition was performed with a TurbolonSpray (ESI) interface in the positive mode by applying multiple reaction monitoring. In LC separation, an ODS column was used with acetic acid-ammonium acetate-methanol as a mobile phase. Recoveries from 8 fruits and vegetables at the fortification level of 0.1 microg\/g were 75.0-91.8% for BRP, 70.2-88.9% for DDVP, and 77.3-92.1% for DEP.

Genomic DNAs were extracted from allergenic substances with a commercial ion-exchange type kit. Four primer pairs suitable for the specific detection of plant DNA were designed to establish a M-PCR method detecting simultaneously the specific DNAs of plant and allergenic substances. Our four designed primer pairs and the primer pair described in the Japanese official method were applied to the specific detection of plant DNA. A primer pair of Plant01-5' and Plant01-3' (amplicon size; 161 bp) was the most suitable for the specific detection of plant DNA. M-PCR was performed to detect the specific DNAs of allergenic substances using four primer pairs, a pair of Plant01-5' and Plant01-3', and three pairs for allergenic components described in the Japanese official method. The four specific PCR bands were simultaneously amplified from genomic DNAs of allergenic substances. The proposed method is simple, rapid and inexpensive.","646":"Alpha-Lipoic acid has recently been permitted for use in foodstuffs and is contained in tablets and capsules. Although alpha-lipoic acid is synthesized from adipic acid, the safety of polymers produced during the purification and drying processes has been an issue of concern. Hence, we examined the safety profiles of thermally denatured polymer (LAP-A) and ethanol-denatured polymer (LAP-B) produced in the manufacturing process of alpha-lipoic acid. Furthermore, we conducted structural analysis of these polymers by 1H-NMR and FAB-MS spectroscopy. In a consecutive ingestion test, male and female mice ingested diet containing 0.1 and 0.2% LAP-A and -B for 4 weeks. Blood uric acid, potassium and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) tended to increase without dose-dependency. Relative liver weights were also increased. However, male dogs that were orally administered LAP-B (500 mg\/kg) once did not show any abnormalities in blood parameters or general condition. These findings indicate that alpha-lipoic acid polymers are not acutely toxic; however, chronic ingestion of these polymers may affect liver and kidney functions.","647":"","648":"","649":"","650":"","651":"","652":"","653":"","654":"","655":"","656":"","657":"","658":"","659":"The differences among the small spines of 6 species of puffers have been clarified by means of microscopic observation. Small spines of puffers arise from the basement, which is composed of spines protruding from the surface skin, with roots extending horizontally in all directions in the layer under the surface skin. Using the characteristic shapes of the basement, we have classified the puffer group of \"Sansaifugu\" (Takifugu flavidus) and \"Mefugu\" (T. obscurus) as Type I and the group of \"Shirosabafugu\" (Lagocephalus wheeleri), \"Kurosabafugu\" (L. gloveri), \"Dokusabafugu\" (L. lunaris) and \"Motosabafugu\" (L. spadiceus) as Type II. The number of fore and back roots, including the branches at the ends, further varies in each group. The length and width of each root were measured. As a result, similar species within the group comprising \"Sansaifugu\" (T. flavidus) and \"Mefugu\" (T. obscurus) and 4 species of the \"Sabafugu\" (Lagocephalus) group including \"Dokusabafugu\" (L. lunaris) have been clearly distinguished. We conclude that examination of the shape of the basement of small spines can be an effective identification index.","660":"Properties of eight commercial licorice extracts used as a food additive (sweetener, listed in the List of Existing Food Additives in the Japanese Food Sanitation Law) were surveyed. Residue on ignition ranged from 0.3 to 12.4%, and pH ranged from 4.1 to 6.8, amount of glycyrrhizin, which is the major component in licorice extract, ranged from 10.9 to 77.4%, sodium ranged from 0.1 to 1.2%, potassium ranged from 0.3 to 5.0%, and ammonium nitrogen ranged from 0.03 to 2.5%. These results indicated that various products were distributed on the market. Differences in the manufacturing process may contribute to the variations of product properties.","661":"Rumput roman extract is used as a natural food preservative. Its antimicrobial activity and constituents were investigated as part of an ongoing study to evaluate its quality and safety as a food additive. The constituents were analyzed by GC\/MS, and 5 major constituents were isolated and identified as capillin, capillene, caryophyllene oxide, alpha-curcumene and methyleugenol using NMR analysis. The antimicrobial activities against E. coli, S. cerevisiae and A. niger were measured by means of the halo test. Based on the results, we confirmed that capillin was the major active constituent. The concentrations of capillin and capillene were determined to 17.9 mg\/mL and 36.1 mg\/mL, respectively, from standard curves of authentic compounds on HPLC.","662":"Possible intermediates in the formation of chloroform during by the sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment of L-tyrosine were investigated using HPLC and LC\/MS. One product showed the same MS characteristics as the substance formed by the NaClO treatment of 4-hydroxybenzyl cyanide (4-HBC), and it was suggested to be m-chloro-4-hydroxybenzyl cyanide (m-C-4-HBC). Since m-C-4-HBC is not commercially available it was synthesized by treating 4-HBC with NaClO, and purified by extraction with ethyl acetate, followed by HPLC on preparative isolation columns, using a column switching method. The product was confirmed to be 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzyl cyanide (3-C-4-HBC), by means of NMR spectral analysis. When L-tyrosine or 4-HBC was treated with NaClO, 3-C-4-HBC and CHCl3 were generated. When 3-C-4-HBC was treated with NaClO, CHCl3 was generated. Judging from these results, 3-C-4-HBC was confirmed to be an intermediate in the formation of CHCl3 from L-tyrosine. Thus, the reaction pathway of CHCl3 formation from L-tyrosine treated with NaClO is concluded to be: L-tyrosine--&gt;4-HBC--&gt;3-C-4-HBC--&gt;CHCl3.","663":"The fungal population and distribution of aflatoxin-producing fungi in 30 samples of imported almond powder products purchased from retail markets were examined in this study. Total counts of fungi ranged from under 1.0 x 10 colony-forming units (CFU)\/g to 8.5 x 10(3) CFU\/g as determined with the dilution plating technique. The predominant fungi in the mould-contaminated almond samples were Aspergillus niger, A. flavus and the related species, Penicillium, Cladosporium and Rhizopus. Aflatoxin-producing ability in the isolates of A. flavus and related fungi were tested by thin layer chromatography using 2% yeast extract and 15% sucrose broth culture. Four different aflatoxigenic fungi were detected in the isolates; aflatoxins B1 and B2 were produced by some strains of A. flavus and A. parvisclerotigenus, and aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2 were produced by all tested strains of A. parasiticus and A. nomius. Identification of the strains was based on morphological and metabolic characters.","664":"Furan is a 5-membered ring compound with high volatility. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently published a report on the occurrence of furan in a large number of thermally processed foods. However, the FDA's analytical method, using standard curve addition, is not suitable for high-throughput routine laboratory operations. We developed a rapid and improved method for determination of furan in foods by headspace GC\/MS. Quantification was achieved by using an internal standard of d4-furan and an external calibration curve of furan normalized against the internal standard. The incubation temperature for equilibration was set at 60 degrees C to avoid the formation of furan during analysis. The levels of furan in baby foods and infant formulas were determined with this method. Validation data showed good precision and accuracy. The LOD and LOQ were 0.2-0.5 ng\/g and 0.5-2 ng\/g for various food matrixes, respectively. The level of furan detected was in the range of 1.4 to 90 ng\/g in baby foods and in the range of non-detectable to 36 ng\/g in infant formulas.","665":"","666":"","667":"","668":"The content of potato glycoalkaloid (PGA) was investigated in 27 cultivars of raw potatoes and 31 potatoes in commercial foods with peel. The investigation of the 27 cultivars of potatoes showed different contents of glycoalkaloids. \"May queen\" and \"Sherry\" showed high contents of PGA (180 mg\/kg and 320 mg\/kg, respectively) among the raw potatoes of middle size (ca. 100 g). On the other hand, \"Inca red\" showed the lowest content of 21 mg\/kg. Higher contents of PGA were found in smaller potatoes in this study. The content of PGA varied in the range of 48-350 mg\/kg in the potatoes in commercial foods with peel.","669":"We previously constructed a database of 341 food-poisoning cases involving various causative agents. Using this database, we developed a new method for estimating the ingestion time of a food suspected of causing a food-poisoning outbreak. We confirmed that the method is superior to conventional methods. In this report, estimation equations specific for seven separate causative agents were obtained using the original database. We analyzed 301 cases in the database and 14 cases not included in the database using the seven estimation equations, the estimation equation in our previous report and the conventional methods. The values estimated with the improved method showed higher correspondence and accuracy than those estimated by using the conventional methods or the method in our previous report. These results confirmed that the improved method is superior to the conventional methods and our previous method.","670":"A simple and rapid method using refractive index high-performance liquid chromatography (RI-HPLC) was developed for the determination of polysorbates (PS) in processed foods. PS were extracted with ethyl acetate containing 5% methanol. The extract was cleaned up on a multimode cartridge (300 mg) and an Alumina-N cartridge (500 mg) to remove fats and food color. HPLC separation was performed on a C18 column (4.6 i.d. x 150 mm) with methanol as the mobile phase. The recoveries of PS80 from nine kinds of foods fortified at the levels 1-5 g\/kg were 80-99%. The limit of quantitation for PS80 in foods was 0.10 g\/kg. The proposed method was applied to Worcestershire sauce that was PS-positive by TLC, and PS was confirmed to be present as PS80 at the concentration of 0.13 g\/kg.","671":"A simple and rapid HPLC method was developed for the simultaneous determination of nine kinds of preservatives, benzoic acid (BA), sorbic acid (SOA), dehydroacetic acid (DHA), methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (PHBA-Me), ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate (PHBA-Et), isopropyl p-hydroxybenzoate (PHBA-isoPu), propyl p-hydroxybenzoate (PHBA-Pu), isobutyl p-hydroxybenzoate (PHBA-isoBu) and butyl p-hydroxybenzoate (PHBA-Bu), in foods. For solid foods, the preservatives were extracted with methanol. After addition of 5 mmol\/L citrate buffer to the extract, the extract solution was cleaned up on an Oasis HLB cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 5 mmol\/L citrate buffer and methanol-5 mmol\/L citrate buffer (4:6). Then, nine kinds of preservatives were eluted with methanol. The eluent was used for BA, SOA and DHA determination by HPLC. Furthermore, a part of the eluent was cleaned up on a Bond Elut PSA cartridge for p-hydroxybenzoate esters determination by HPLC. Liquid foods were cleaned up after addition of 5 mmol\/L citrate buffer without the extraction process, and the subsequent procedure was the same as for solid foods. The recoveries of p-hydroxybenzoate esters from ten kinds of foods fortified at levels of 0.01 and 0.10 g\/kg each were 91.5 to 107.4%, and those of BA, SOA and DHA were 76.4 to 104.8%. The quantitation limits of the preservatives in foods were 0.005 g\/kg. (Received March 20, 2006)","672":"The oxidation of oils has important effects on the quality of oily foods, such as instant noodles. In particular, the generation of aldehydes, which accompanies the oxidation of oils, is one of the first factors to reduce food quality. We examined various indicators of oil quality during temperature-accelerated storage and found that peroxide value (POV) was highly correlated with the total concentration of major odorants. Moreover, the correlation of POV with the total concentration of five unsaturated aldehydes (t-2-heptenal, t-2-octenal, t-2-decenal, t-2-undecenal and t,t-2,4-decadienal) that show strong cytotoxicity was greater than the correlation of POV with the total concentration of major odorants. The maximum allowable concentration of the five aldehydes was calculated based on the 'no observed adverse-effect level' of the aldehyde that showed the highest cytotoxicity, t,t-2,4-decadienal, along with the human daily oil intake. We showed that it is useful to utilize POV as an indicator to control food quality and safety.","673":"A chronic feeding study to evaluate the safety of the genetically modified glyphosate-tolerant soybeans (GM soybeans) was conducted using rats. F344 DuCrj rats were fed diet containing GM soybeans or Non-GM soybeans at the concentration of 30% in basal diet. Non-GM soybeans were closely related strain of GM soybeans. These two diets were adjusted to an identical nutrient level. In this study, the influence of GM soybeans on rats was compared with that of the Non-GM soybeans, and furthermore, to assess the effect of soybeans themselves, the groups of rats fed GM and Non-GM soybeans were compared with a group fed commercial diet (CE-2). General conditions were observed daily and body weight and food consumption were recorded. At the intermediate examination (26 weeks), and at the termination (52 weeks), animals were subjected to hematology, serum biochemistry, and pathological examination. There were several differences in animal growth, food intake, serum biochemical parameters and histological findings between the rats fed the GM and\/or Non-GM soybeans and the rats fed CE-2. However, body weight and food intake were similar for the rats fed the GM and Non-GM soybeans. Gross necropsy findings, hematological and serum biochemical parameters, organ weights, and pathological findings showed no meaningful difference between rats fed the GM and Non-GM soybeans. These results indicate that long-term intake of GM soybeans at the level of 30% in diet has no apparent adverse effect in rats.","674":"","675":"","676":"Pesictide residues in 343 samples of domestic rice and 32 samples of imported rice purchased on the Tokyo market from April 1995 to March 2005 were investigated. Residues of eleven kinds of pesticides (including organophosphorus, organochlorine, carbamate, pyrethroid and organonitrogen pesticides and bromide) were detected at levels between trace and 1 ppm in 47 domestic rice samples. DDVP and bromide residues were detected at levels between 0.01 ppm and 5 ppm in 18 imported rice samples. For rice samples that were found to containing pesticides, the amounts of pesticide intake were calculated according to the daily intake of rice, and they were compared with the ADI values. Since residual pesticide levels were 17\/10,000-2\/5 of ADI, all the rice samples were considered to be safe for human consumption.","677":"In food-poisoning outbreaks, the ingestion time of suspect foods has been estimated using the Sartwell method (Hirayama method), the graphical method and maximum likelihood estimation. These methods are based upon the assumption that the incubation period is log-normally distributed. However, these methods may not always be valid because the bias and variability of the estimates are large. We constructed a database from 341 food-poisoning cases in the literature. Using this database, we developed a method to estimate the actual ingestion time based on the period from the ingestion time to the first outbreak, using a multiple linear regression equation. Since only 9.09% of cases showed log-normal distribution, the above three methods would not be valid in most cases. The new method was applicable in all cases. In addition, the values estimated by the new method showed higher correspondence and accuracy than the values estimated by the other methods. Therefore, we consider that the new method is superior to those methods.","678":"","679":"","680":"A duplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Clostridium botulinum types A and B was developed. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were verified by using 6 strains of type A, 7 strains of type B, and 14 genera of 42 non-C. botulinum types A and B strains, including C. botulinum types C, D, E, F, and G. In pure culture, the detection limit was 10(2) CFU\/ mL for type A and 10(3) CFU\/mL for type B. In mushroom broth, increases in the amounts of C. botulinum types A and B could be monitored separately (the quantifiable range was 10(2) to 10(6) for type A and 10(2) to 10(7) for type B) from each sample that contained a large number of background bacteria, and toxin could be detected much earlier than with mouse assay. These results suggest that duplex quantitative PCR methods are useful to detect and quantify C. botulinum types A and\/ or B toxin genes.","681":"The paralytic shellfish poison (PSP)-producing dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum (Gc) was fed to the short-necked clam Tapes japonica, and the accumulation, transformation and elimination profiles of PSP were investigated by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with postcolumn fluorescence derivatization (HPLC-FLD). The short-necked clams ingested most of the Gc cells (4 x 10(6) cells) supplied as a bolus at the beginning of the experiment, and accumulated a maximal amount of toxin (181 nmol\/10 clams) after 12 hr. The rate of toxin accumulation at that time was 16%, which rapidly decreased thereafter. During the rearing period, a variation in toxin composition, derived presumably from the transformation of toxin analogues in the clams, was observed, including a reversal of the ratio of C2 to C1, and the appearance of carbamate (gonyautoxin (GTX) 2, 3) and decarbamoyl (dc) derivatives (decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and dcGTX2, 3), which were undetectable in Gc cells. The total amount of toxin contained in clams and residue (remaining Gc cells and\/or excrement in the rearing tank) gradually declined, and only about 1% of the supplied toxin was detected at the end of the experiment.","682":"We examined the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dioxin-like PCBs) in muscle and gut tissues from Japanese common squid and saury. These body parts are often eaten in Japan, so it is important to measure their dioxin concentrations and evaluate the risks to consumers. The toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations in the squid gut samples (1.0 to 14 pg-TEQ\/g fresh weight, n=3) were 50-fold larger than those in the muscle tissues (0.020 to 0.22 pg-TEQ\/g fresh weight, n = 3) taken from the same samples. By contrast, the TEQ concentrations in the saury gut samples (0.35 to 0.63 pg-TEQ\/g fresh weight, n=3) were only 1.1- to 1.7-fold greater than those in the muscle tissues (0.33 to 0.37 pg-TEQ\/g fresh weight, n= 3) from the same samples. The TEQ contents in the squid gut tissues ranged from 60 to 990 pg-TEQ\/squid, accounting for about 95% of the total dioxin content of the edible parts of the samples. By contrast, the TEQ contents in the saury gut tissues ranged from 4.4 to 12 pg-TEQ\/saury, accounting for less than 25% of the total dioxin content of the edible parts of the samples. These tissues showed comparable PCDD\/PCDF-congener and dioxin-like PCB-isomer profiles in both species. The results indicate that squid gut tissues occasionally contain high levels of dioxins, and consumption of this foodstuff could potentially significantly increase the dietary intake of dioxins.","683":"The identification of 20 strains of yeasts isolated from foods by means of DNA sequence analysis with two kinds of universal primers for the rDNA region was examined, and the results were compared with those of the conventional phenotyping test using API 20C AUX. In the analysis of the 26S region, all 20 yeast strains tested were identified at the species level. In the ITS1 region, 16 strains were also classified at the species level. In addition, all results of DNA sequence analysis were consistent with those of the phenotyping test at the genus level. Furthermore, DNA sequence analysis was able to identify causative yeasts observed in two suspect foods, though phenotyping tests alone failed to identify them.","684":"","685":"","686":"","687":"Contents of minerals (Mg, Ca, Na and K), anions (SO4(2-), Br- and Cl) and heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn, Hg and As) were determined in 17 commercial samples of Nigari, 15 samples of crude magnesium chloride (sea water) products as a food additive and 2 magnesium-containing foods. Obtained values were compared with the specifications proposed in a draft of the eighth edition of Japan's Specifications and Standards for Food Additives. Out of 15 food additive samples, only 5 samples satisfied the specification. Since the Joint FAO\/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) proposed to lower the limits of heavy metals in food additives, a simple method was developed for the determination of low levels of Pb and Cd by extracting chelates of these metals with organic solvents. The quantification limits for Pb and Cd were 0.5 microg\/g and 0.05 microg\/g, respectively. It was estimated from the SO4(2-)\/Ca ratios that 15 samples were sea water evaporation products, and the remaining 2 were ion-exchange membrane process products. No pollution with heavy metals was found in any of the samples.","688":"A newly developed HPLC method for determination of glycarbylamide (GB) in chicken liver was applied to other tissues (muscle, fat and kidney). The recoveries of GB in muscle, fat and kidney were 87.2% (CV 0.5), 91.3% (CV 4.7), 79.7% (CV 1.0), respectively. The detection limit of GB was 0.01 ppm. GB concentrations were determined by this method in tissues (muscle, fat, liver and kidney) from chickens sacrificed 5 days after oral administration of GB mixed in feed at 60 mg\/kg of feed for 7 days. GB was not detected in these chicken tissues.","689":"A predictive program for microbial growth under various temperature conditions was developed with a mathematical model. The model was a new logistic model recently developed by us. The program predicts Escherichia coli growth in broth, Staphylococcus aureus growth and its enterotoxin production in milk, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus growth in broth at various temperature patterns. The program, which was built with Microsoft Excel (Visual Basic Application), is user-friendly; users can easily input the temperature history of a test food and obtain the prediction instantly on the computer screen. The predicted growth and toxin production can be important indices to determine whether a food is microbiologically safe or not. This program should be a useful tool to confirm the microbial safety of commercial foods.","690":"The preventive effects of acidic xylooligosaccharide prepared from xylan of corncobs and related sugars on stress-induced gastric inflammation in mice were investigated. Oral administration of acidic xylooligosaccharide and hydrocortisone at doses of 100 and 200 mg\/kg body weight significantly reduced the number of bleeding points in the gastric mucosa of mice loaded with cold-restraint stress. Acidic xylooligosaccharide showed concentration-dependent superoxide anion radical-scavenging activity at concentrations of 3.3-4.3 mg\/mL and its IC50 was 3.5 mg\/mL, although this value is approximately six times that of quercetin. The antioxidant activity of acidic xylooligosaccharide could contribute, in part, to its suppressive activities on stress-induced mouse gastritis. Xylose, xylobiose, xylan, and glucuronic acid showed no significant suppressive activities on mouse gastric inflammation at a dose of 100 mg\/kg body weight. These results suggest that an appropriate degree of polymerization of xylan (larger than trimer) is necessary for the activities of acidic xylooligosaccharide.","691":"A simple and accurate method using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) was developed for the determination of tetracyclines (TCs), i.e., oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline (CTC) and tetracycline (TC), in honey and royal jelly. Mass spectral acquisition was performed in the positive mode. In LC separation, L-column ODS and 0.01% formic acid-acetonitrile were used as the column and mobile phase, respectively. TCs in a honey sample were diluted with water, while TCs in royal jelly were extracted with 2% metaphosphoric acid-methanol (6:4). They were cleaned up with Oasis HLB and Sep Pak C18 cartridges, respectively. The quantification limits of TC, OTC, and CTC were 5, 5, and 10 ng\/g, respectively, while those in royal jelly were 25, 25, and 50 ng\/g, respectively. The recoveries of TCs from both honey and royal jelly were 75-120%.","692":"Molecular approaches are being developed to provide for the rapid and objective identification of fungi. We attempted the identification of Fusarium species by a genetic analysis to validate practically the utility of a molecular approach for fungal identification and to reveal its limitations, and sequenced three regions, the 5' end of the 28S rRNA gene (D2 region) and the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) regions, in the rRNA genes. The DNA sequences of 38 Fusarium strains isolated from domestic unpolished rice were compared for similarity with entries in the GenBank. Based on this comparison, it was estimated that all these three regions, as a minimum, must be compared with the database to identify Fusaria at the species level. According to the combinations of sequences in the three regions, the 38 isolates were classified into 13 groups. Out of the 13 groups, 6 groups (20 isolates in total) could be identified as definite species based only on the sequence data. For the other 6 groups (17 isolates in total), candidate species were limited on the basis of the sequence similarity, and then the isolates were identified at the species level with the aid of morphology. Only one isolate could not be identified. These results verified that DNA sequence comparison with the GenBank database is useful for the identification of Fusarium species.","693":"A simple and rapid detection of short tandem repeat (STR) markers was studied as a screening test for individual identification of cattle. DNAs were extracted from eight commercial beef samples by a proteinase K-boil method followed by purification with 2-propanol precipitation. Five STR markers, known to be highly polymorphic, were amplified by PCR and analyzed both by a conventional sequencing analysis (SEQ) and by a proposed microchip electrophoresis (MEP). Every marker revealed high polymorphism, such as 5-9 alleles in SEQ analysis, and 4-6 alleles in MEP analysis. This simple and rapid MEP analysis is expected to be an effective screening tool with use of confirmatory SEQ analysis.","694":"A reversed-phase ion-pair HPLC method with ultraviolet detection has been developed for determination of metoclopramide (MCP) in bovine and swine muscle, liver, kidney, fat and intestine. MCP was extracted from samples with acetonitrile, and the extracts were cleaned up on an Oasis HLB cartridge (60 mg) after liquid-liquid extraction. The limit of detection of MCP was 0.002 microg\/g and the limit of quantitation was 0.007 microg\/g. Recoveries of MCP spiked at 0.03 ppm ranged from 74.1 to 93.3% for bovine tissues and from 86.1 to 92.7% for swine tissues. The present method was used for the analysis of bovine and swine tissues 1 day after withdrawal following drug administration. The MCP concentrations in all tissues were lower than the Japanese provisional MRLs.","695":"A new and simple analytical method for glycarbylamide (GB) based on the formation of nickel chelate was developed. The proposed method is as follows: sample solution is mixed with 0.08 mmol\/L nickel nitrate in 0.2 mol\/L carbonate buffer (pH 9.0), and the absorbance is measured at 290 nm. Under the optimal conditions, GB could be determined in the concentration range from 0.13 microg\/mL to 2.6 microg\/mL (r = 0.9999). Using this method for HPLC post column reaction, GB levels in chicken liver extracts could be determined. The recovery of GB was 79.4% (RSD=2.6%, n=3) and the quantitation limit was 30 ng\/g. The apparent molar extinction coefficient (epsilon) of the GB-nickel complex was 8.5 x 10(3). The molar ratio of the complex is GB: nickel ion = 2:1.","696":"The fasciolicides tribromsalan (TBS), oxyclozanide (OCZ) and bromofenofos (BFF) were orally administered to three lactating cows. The concentrations of TBS, OCZ and the BFF metabolite dephosphate bromofenofos (DBFF) in plasma, and the excretion of these compounds in milk were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. In plasma, the concentrations of TBS, OCZ and DBFF reached maximum at about 1.0 day and the compounds remained detectable until 5.7, 7.4 and 15.1 days after administration, respectively. The detection limits of these compounds in plasma were 10, 2 and 2 ppb, respectively. In milk, the concentrations of TBS, OCZ and DBFF reached maximum at about 24 hours and the compounds remained detectable until 30-47, 30-47 and 78-119 hours after administration, respectively. The detection limits of these compounds in milk were 5.1 and 1 ppb, respectively. The residence times of TBS and BFF were very close to the withdrawal times of the fasciolicides.","697":"A determination method for epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) in bottled foods was developed and used to survey bottled foods on the Japanese market. The amount of sample required was decreased to 20 g and the standard addition method was adopted for the quantification, because lipid in foods interrupted the hydrolysis of ESBO. The recoveries were 87.1 and 98.9% and the determination limit was 5.0 microg\/g for a 20 g sample, be cause lipid in foods interupted the hydrolysis of ESBO. The recoveries using the internal standard method varied widely, because hydrolysis of the internal standard, cis-11,14-eicosadienoic acid ethyl ester, was affected more than that of ESBO by coexisting lipid in the sample. ESBO was not detected in any of the bottled baby food samples examined (14 samples), though it had been frequently detected in previous European surveys. This difference may be related to the low fat content and low fluidity of the bottled baby foods retailed in Japan. On the other hand, ESBO was detected at levels of 25.7-494.0 microg\/g in liver paste, pasta sauce, Sungan in spicy oil, and spicy oil. These foods had higher fat content and higher fluidity. However, ESBO intake from these foods appears unlikely to exceed the TDI in the EU (1 mg\/kg bw\/day).","698":"","699":"","700":"","701":"","702":"","703":"","704":"Accidents caused by the bursting of capped PET bottles with leftover contents have increased in Japan. Therefore, the bursting risk of capped PET bottles with leftover contents was investigated. The ratios of distension, after 10 days at 25 degrees C, of capped PET bottles with leftover orange juice were approx. 70% in the case of drinking while eating Kimuchi, and approx. 6% in the case of drinking but not eating. Among 58 distended bottles, none burst spontaneously, but 4 bottles (6.9%) burst upon physical shock (dropping onto a concrete floor from 1.5 m height). The greatest distensions of capped PET bottles were observed with leftover orange juice, apple juice and soured milk after 10 days at 25 degrees C. No distensions were observed in bottles containing leftover sports drink and green tea under the same conditions. Identified organisms from distended bottles were almost all Candida spp. When those Candida spp. strains were inoculated individually into PET bottles half full of orange, apple or sour milk, all bottles were distended after 7 days at 25 degrees C. From the above results, it appears that there is a risk that capped PET bottles with leftover contents, especially sour fruit juice or soured milk, may burst owing to high gas pressure caused by yeast growth during storage at room temperature for over 1 week.","705":"The infrared absorption (IR) spectrum is often used as a standard reference in identification tests of food additives in Japan. In the case of betaine, many different IR spectra have been reported and, therefore, it is necessary to establish an IR spectrum that is reproducible and reliable enough to be used as a standard for identification. In the present study, suitable conditions to obtain a standard IR spectrum were examined from various viewpoints, including pretreatment, selection of method, and measuring technique. The KBr disk method, which has generally been used to identify betaine, was found to be humidity-dependent, and there was also an interaction between betaine and KBr. A reproducible IR spectrum suitable as a standard could be obtained by drying betaine at 105 degrees C for 3 hours over phosphorus pentoxide, and then measuring the IR spectrum by the liquid paraffin (Nujol) paste method.","706":"The applicability of GC, GC\/MS and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) to screening for 140 pesticides in agricultural products was examined. Validation of multi-residue screening methods for the determination of 88 pesticides in 12 crops (asparagus, cauliflower, burdock, carrot, broccoli, spinach, matsutake mushroom, orange, soybean, sesame, millet and tea) was done by GC and GC\/MS. Of the 88 pesticides, 63 were obtained with recoveries in the range from 50 to 150% at the 0.1 microg\/g level in the 12 crops. Applicability of the official methods in Japan to 74 pesticides, including 22 pesticides with low recovery (&lt; 50%) by GC or GC\/MS analysis, was also examined by LC\/MS\/MS. LC\/MS\/MS acquisition parameters were established for 67 pesticides in positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes. Of 67 pesticides validated in 7 crops using LC\/MS\/MS at the 0.1 microg\/g level, 44 showed recoveries in the range from 50 to 150%. The occurrence of matrix interference in LC\/MS\/MS can lead to false-positive detection of MCPA in spinach, cabbage and orange and false-negative detection of four pesticides in orange, spinach, apple and unpolished rice. Good linearity was observed in the studied ranges by GC, GC\/MS (r &gt; 0.990) and LC\/MS\/MS (r &gt; 0.995). Of the total of 140 pesticides validated by GC, GC\/MS and LC\/MS\/MS, 107 were newly recognized as suitable subjects for screening.","707":"The Japanese Government has prohibited the use of seafood protein, as well as mammalian protein, in ruminant feed. There is an official method to detect meat and bone meal, but no method is yet available to detect fishmeal in ruminant feed. We tried to develop a suitable method to detect fishmeal in ruminant feed, similar to the official method \"PCR detection of animal-derived DNA in feed\". Our previously reported primers (fishcon5 and fishcon3-1) showed low sensitivity, so we designed new primers based on a DNA sequence from yellowfin tuna mitchondrial DNA. Among the primers, FM5 and FM3 specifically detected fish DNA (sardine, yellowfin tuna, skipjack tuna, chub mackerel, Pacific saury, salmon, rainbow trout, Japanese anchovy, codfish and Japanese horse mackerel) from fish meat, and did not amplify DNA from animals and plants. The sensitivity for detection of the presence of fishmeal in ruminant feed was 0.01-0.001%.","708":"A screening method is described for determining 200 pesticides, except dimethipin, divided into four groups by means of gas chromatography\/tandem mass spectrometry (GC\/MS\/MS) using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with automated gain control (AGC). The quantitation limit for 194 pesticides was 0.01 mg\/kg on a crop basis, except for allidochlor, dimethoate, hexythiazox, methamidophos and triadimenol. The calibration curve of each pesticide was linear in the range of 0.04-5.0 microg\/mL. One hundred and ninety-nine pesticides were added to matrix of potato, spinach, cabbage, apple, orange, soybean and unpolished rice at twice the limits of quantitation. The recoveries of 194 pesticides from all crops were satisfactory (50-150%) for screening purposes. Although some pesticides in apple and orange were not determined by selected ion monitoring (SIM) analysis at the limits of quantitation, all of them were identified by ion-trap GC\/MS\/MS at the same concentration. Thus, the ion trap GC\/MS\/MS technique is useful for the screening of residual pesticides present at low levels in agricultural products.","709":"A simultaneous method using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS\/MS) was developed for the determination of pesticide residues in crops. Mass spectral acquisition was performed in the positive mode by applying multiple reaction monitoring. In LC separation, an Atlantis dC18 Column was used with acetic acid-ammonium acetate-acetonitrile as the mobile phase. Pesticide residues in crops were extracted with acetone, and cleaned up by liquid-liquid separation with saturated salt solution and hexane, followed by an ENVI-Carb cartridge. The quantification limits of compounds in crops were below 5 ng\/g. Eighty compounds were obtained with recoveries ranging from 60 to 130% at the level of 50 ng\/g with RSD (%) of less than 15%. Fifty crop samples were analyzed by the developed method. Seven pesticide residues were detected in nine crops.","710":"","711":"","712":"","713":"","714":"","715":"","716":"","717":"","718":"","719":"","720":"","721":"Epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) was surveyed in the 103 samples of cap sealing for bottled foods on the Japanese market. Most of the sealings were made of polyvinyl chloride, while a few were made of polyethylene or acrylic resin. All the sealings contained ESBO in the range of 0.006-42.4%. Sealings for baby food, jam, etc. contained higher levels of ESBO, though those for beverages contained lower levels. Sealings in lug caps and press-on twist caps contained higher levels of ESBO, though that in pilfer-proof caps contained lower levels. Some sealings in screw caps and lug caps also contained other plasticizers, for example, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and diisononyl phthalate, and their ESBO contents were 1\/10 of those in sealings containing only ESBO. In this survey, ESBO was the most common plasticizer in cap sealing resin for bottled foods on the Japanese market.","722":"Allergic substances (eggs, milk) in commercial foods were measured by means of the notified ELISA methods using FASTKIT ELISA kit (N kit) and \"Tokuteigenzairyo sokutei kit\" (M kit). Some samples were also analyzed with the notified western blot method using \"Tokuteigenzairyo western blot kit\". In the methods for detection of eggs, proteins of fish egg and chicken muscle were examined using the ELISA and Western blotting methods to check for cross-reaction. Sujiko was false positive with the M kit. Difficulties were also encountered in the notified ELISA and Western blotting methods with raw chicken. In foods labeled as containing eggs, it was difficult to detected in the heart-processed food using both notified methods. In the method for detection of milk, foods containing thickening polysaccharides, showed cross-reaction with the N kit. However, this cross-reaction was eliminated when an improved N kit was used. Foods labeled as containing milk did not present any difficulty.","723":"A total of 369 samples of rice (n = 311), wheat (n = 10), soybean (n = 44), and adzuki bean (n = 4) collected from various locations in Japan between 1999 and 2002 were analyzed for PCDDs, PCDFs (PCDD\/Fs) and coplanar PCBs. Sampling points within about 1 km of operational municipal waste incinerators that were considered sources of dioxins were defined as \"near-source\" areas, and all other sampling points were defined as \"general\" areas. The toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) values of soybean samples collected from near-source areas were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than those from general areas. A significant difference of TEQs among sampling years in rice in general areas was also found. However, the differences could not be explained by the presence or absence of incineration plants in the area surrounding the sampling point or by a temporal decrease of air pollution. The TEQs of the crops varied widely, but the median value of each crop was quite low, at 0.000021, 0.00013, 0.0000095, and 0.00016 pg-TEQ\/g wet wt. in rice, wheat, soybean and adzuki bean, respectively. On the basis of these survey results, the daily intake of PCDD\/Fs and coplanar PCBs from rice, wheat, soybean, and adzuki bean was calculated. The daily intakes from these crops were estimated to be 0.0056 pg-TEQ\/kg B.W.\/day on the assumption that \"not detected\" (ND) could be taken as zero, ND = 0, and 0.18 pg-TEQ\/kg B.W.\/day if ND is put equal to 1\/2 LOD (half the limit of detection). In comparison with the tolerable daily intake set in Japan for PCDD\/Fs and coplanar PCBs (4 pg-TEQ\/kg B.W.\/day), it was considered that the levels of contamination by PCDD\/Fs and coplanar PCBs in these crops cultivated in the environment of Japan do not present a problem.","724":"As part of an investigation on the chemical constituents and contaminants of the basidiomycete Pleurocybella porrigens (Japanese name: Sugihiratake), we analyzed the UV-detected constituents of this mushroom using HPLC. One of the major UV peaks detected was isolated and identified as a-eleostearic acid, a long-chain fatty acid with a conjugated triene moiety, based on the results of spectroscopic methods. alpha-Eleostearic acid was concluded to be a characteristic fatty acid of P. porrigens, because it was not detected in eight other edible mushrooms examined. Free long-chain fatty acids in P. porrigens and other edible mushrooms were analyzed by HPLC after derivatization with acidic 2-nitrophenylhydrazine hydrochloride. Oleic acid was the main fatty acid in P. porrigens, and saturated long-chain fatty acids such as linoleic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid, together with a-eleostearic acid, were also detected.","725":"We studied the determination of methoprene in foods by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The sample was extracted with acetonitrile and the extract was salted out by adding sodium chloride, allowing the acetonitrile layer to separate. The acetonitrile solution was washed with hexane saturated with acetonitrile, cleaned up on a Florisil column and determined by HPLC. The recovery of methoprene from spiked samples was 74.6-82.8%. In an evaluation of this method by 6 analytical laboratories, mean recoveries from spiked samples ranged from 79.4% to 84.6%. Repeatability relative standard deviation values were 2.3-8.8% and reproducibility relative standard deviation values were 8.8-23.6%. The detection limits were 0.001-0.02 microg\/g and below the detection limit of the Notified Analytical Method.","726":"Urushi wax is a natural gum base used as a food additive. In order to evaluate the quality of urushi wax as a food additive and to obtain information useful for setting official standards, we investigated the constituents and their concentrations in urushi wax, using the same sample as scheduled for toxicity testing. After methanolysis of urushi wax, the composition of fatty acids was analyzed by GC\/MS. The results indicated that the main fatty acids were palmitic acid, oleic acid and stearic acid. LC\/MS analysis of urushi wax provided molecular-related ions of the main constituents. The main constituents were identified as triglycerides, namely glyceryl tripalmitate (30.7%), glyceryl dipalmitate monooleate (21.2%), glyceryl dioleate monopalmitate (2.1%), glyceryl monooleate monopalmitate monostearate (2.6%), glyceryl dipalmitate monostearate (5.6%), glyceryl distearate monopalmitate (1.4%). Glyceryl dipalmitate monooleate isomers differing in the binding sites of each constituent fatty acid could be separately determined by LC\/MS\/MS.","727":"We examined endotoxin and pyrogen contents in several kinds of natural and cultivated edible mushrooms, as well as some cultivated vegetables. According to the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, 14th Ed., two types of endotoxin (gel-clot Limulus amebocyte lysate) test and the pyrogen test were performed using natural edible mushrooms collected in Aichi Prefecture and cultivated mushrooms and vegetables purchased at a market. The endotoxin contents of natural mushrooms were apparently higher than those of cultivated mushrooms or vegetables. The endotoxin contents in the cultivated mushrooms were slightly higher than those in the vegetables. Similar results were obtained in the pyrogen test.","728":"A study of the dietary intake of dioxins, consisting of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCBs) through baby foods in the metropolitan Tokyo area was carried out. The samples were homemade baby foods prepared by the total diet-market basket method and baby foods (mainly commercial items) prepared by the duplicate portion method. The daily intake of dioxins per kg of body weight from baby foods in each weaning stage for the case of half intake of homemade baby foods and the other half of mainly commercial items was 0.32 pg TEQ\/kg\/day in the early stage, 0.45 pg TEQ\/kg\/day in the intermediate stage, 0.58 pg TEQ\/kg\/day in the late stage and 1.25 pg TEQ\/kg\/day in the completed stage. While the daily intakes increase with the weaning progress, they were less than the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 4 pg TEQ\/kg\/day for dioxins established in Japan. Dioxins were mainly taken through formula milk in early stage of weaning period, but then were taken through protein-based foods in the subsequent weaning stage.","729":"A novel method for estimating viable Salmonella Enteritidis cell counts with 5'-nuclease real-time PCR was developed in this study. Our method was based on the increase kinetics of the target DNA region (invA) of the microorganism growing in a food\/clinical sample in a culture medium during incubation. The index of increase in the target DNA region studied here was threshold cycle, CT. A test Salmonella strain was grown in buffered peptone water at the optimal temperature (39 degrees C). As Salmonella cells were grown, the value of CT decreased with time, generating a downward sigmoidal curve. The slope of the curve was constant at various initial cell concentrations. With higher initial cell concentration, the CT value evaluated from the slope at a given time was lower. With this relationship, a novel method for estimating the initial viable cell concentration of a sample was developed. Dead Salmonella cells or bacteria other than the target cell caused deviation in the CT curve. Incubation in a selective media suppressed the deviation caused by other bacterial cells. We think that this method could be applied to many other microorganisms cultivable in a suitable medium.","730":"A simple and rapid method for the identification of genetically modified (GM) papaya, derived from Line 55-1, was developed by modifying the Japanese official PCR method. Genomic DNA was directly extracted from the fresh fruit without the lyophilization step, using a commercial silica-based kit. To develop a duplex PCR method which simultaneously detects the GM papaya-specific gene and the intrinsic papain gene, the papain 2-5'\/3' (amplicon size; 184 bp) primer pair for the detection of the papain gene was newly designed within the region of the products (211 bp) amplified using the papain 1-5'\/-3' primer pair adopted in the Japanese official PCR method. To detect the GM papaya-specific gene, the primer pair Nos C-5'\/CaM N-3' described in the Japanese official method was used. The DNA sequences of the GM papaya gene and the intrinsic papain gene were co-amplified using the PCR method in a single tube. The developed duplex PCR method allows the simultaneous detection of the products by means of agarose gel electrophoresis or microchip electrophoresis. The proposed method for GM papaya identification is simple and rapid.","731":"A method for simultaneous determination of multiple pesticide residues in agricultural products was developed by using a pretreatment with ultrafiltration, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS). The pretreatment process (extraction of pesticides from agricultural products with methanol, dilution of the extract with water, and ultrafiltration) gave recoveries in the range of 50-150% for 63 of 83 pesticides spiked at 0.25 microg\/ g into 6 agricultural products. The detection limits of pesticides by LC\/MS\/MS were below 0.0005-0.05 micro\/g. This method is useful for screening purposes and for multiresidue analysis of pesticides in agricultural products. Pesticide residues in 50 domestic crops were investigated by this method, and residues of 14 pesticides were detected in 30 crops.","732":"","733":"","734":"Residues of PCB and organochlorine pesticides in meats (beef, pork and poultry) and processed meat products collected in Osaka, Japan were surveyed. For 35 years from 1970 to 2004, the concentrations of PCB, HCH isomers, DDT analogues and dieldrin in all meats appeared to decline with each passing year. The concentration of each isomer of HCH in all meats declined rapidly from the early to the late 1970's and showed a gentle decline thereafter; beta-HCH showed the highest residue rate of the isomers in all the time periods surveyed, except for pork and poultry samples in the early 1980's. The concentrations of DDT analogues in all meats also showed sharp declines from the late 1970's to the early 1980's, followed by a smaller decrease thereafter; the main residues were pp'-DDD, p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT, and the residue rate of p,p'-DDE increased over the years. The residue levels of organochlorine pesticides in processed meat products (raw materials: beef, pork, poultry and mixture of ground beef and pork) were surveyed for 15 years (from 1990 to 2004) and there were no significant differences in the values among the materials. The concentrations of each pesticide in processed meat products tended to be lower than those of the corresponding meat samples, respectively.","735":"From January to November, 2003, bacterial contamination was surveyed in a small egg-breaking factory that produced non pasteurized liquid egg. Test egg samples were taken at various stages of the egg processing operation. Salmonella Enteritidis was isolated from liquid egg yolk and liquid egg white on October, but was not found in any other samples (50 liquid egg samples, 21 containers and 94 attached production facilities and gloves). The data suggest that the contamination rate (3.8%) is lower than those reported previously. Levels of bacterial standard plate counts, gram-positive bacterial counts and gram-negative bacterial counts were in the ranges of 2 to 5 log CFU\/g, 2 to 3 log CFU\/g, 2 to 5 log CFU\/g, respectively. Liquid egg containers returned from customers was contaminated with bacteria at the level of 8 log CFU per container. However, washing and application of a sanitizer containing sodium hypochlorite reduced the bacterial counts.","736":"We recently studied the growth characteristics of Escherichia coli cells in pouched mashed potatoes (Fujikawa et al., J. Food Hyg. Soc. Japan, 47, 95-98 (2006)). Using those experimental data, in the present study, we compared a logistic model newly developed by us with the modified Gompertz and the Baranyi models, which are used as growth models worldwide. Bacterial growth curves at constant temperatures in the range of 12 to 34 degrees C were successfully described with the new logistic model, as well as with the other models. The Baranyi gave the least error in cell number and our model gave the least error in the rate constant and the lag period. For dynamic temperature, our model successfully predicted the bacterial growth, whereas the Baranyi model considerably overestimated it. Also, there was a discrepancy between the growth curves described with the differential equations of the Baranyi model and those obtained with DMfit, a software program for Baranyi model fitting. These results indicate that the new logistic model can be used to predict bacterial growth in pouched food.","737":"We examined the lateral flow strip assay for identifying unauthorized genetically modified (GM) rice. The GM rice expresses the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin, CryIAc protein, which confers tolerance to insects. The recombinant CryIAc protein was prepared from the inclusion bodies of an E. coli. strain into which the CryIAc gene had been inserted, using gel filtration chromatography. The lateral flow strip assay for the identification of GM cotton which also expresses CryIAc protein, was applied to unpolished rice and polished rice spiked with recombinant CryIAc protein. The spiked recombinant CryIAc protein was clearly detected at the level of 0.012 microg\/g in both the unpolished and polished rice. After loading of the extract on the strip, a 60 -minute stand time is necessary to clearly detect CryIAc protein. The detection limit was approximately 12 ng CryIAc protein per gram of rice. These results suggest that the lateral flow strip assay for GM cotton can be used to detect CryIAc protein expressed in GM rice.","738":"A peak considered to be due to disulfoton sulfoxide as a metabolite of disulfoton was detected in the analysis of the chingentsuai extraction solution of vegetables by GC-FPD. In the analysis by GC\/MS for identification, though the retention time and the mass spectrum were the same as those of the standard, the spectrum was different from MS library data. It appeared that decomposition of disulfoton sulfoxide occurred at the inlet. Therefore, we used a programmed temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet in the pulsed splitless mode to achieve a low inlet temperature and high injection pressure. As a result, the expected mass spectrum of disulfoton sulfoxide was obtained. Under this condition, the peak obtained from chingentsuai was identified as disulfoton sulfoxide. Disulfoton sulfoxide was detected from 2 of 25 chingentsuai samples, at concentrations of 0.66 microg\/g and 0.14 microg\/g.","739":"Migration of bisphenol A (BPA) and benzophenones, i.e., benzophenone (BZ), 4-(dimethylamino)benzophenone (DMAB), Michler's ketone (MK) and 4,4'-bis(diethylamino)benzophenone (DEAB), from 21 paper and paperboard products (15 recycled paperboard boxes and 6 virgin paper products) used in contact with food was examined. Migration levels of compounds from recycled paperboard were compared under various food-simulating conditions. BPA showed the highest migration into 20% ethanol and benzophenones into 95% ethanol. No compounds migrated from virgin paper products, but compounds did migrate into food simulants from recycled paperboard food boxes. BPA migrated into 20% ethanol from all recycled paperboard food boxes between 1.0 and 18.7 ng\/mL. Into 95% ethanol, migration of BZ was observed in 8 samples (1.0-18.9 ng\/mL), DMAB in 12 samples (1.2-3.7 ng\/mL), MK in 13 samples (1.9-9.0 ng\/mL), and DEAB in 13 samples (1.0-10.6 ng\/mL). The highest migration level was 27.2 ng\/mL and most of the migration levels were below 10 ng\/mL. These values are sufficiently low compared with the TDI and NOAEL levels. Moreover, the amount of food in daily meals that comes into contact with paperboard products is relatively small. Consequently, it was concluded that there was no safety concern regarding the tested compounds in recycled paperboard food boxes.","740":"Characteristics of the growth kinetics of Escherichia coli cells in pouched mashed potatoes under various conditions were studied with a mathematical model. Bacterial cells were inoculated in sterile mashed potatoes and then sealed in vinyl pouches, in which a very small amount of air was included. The growth curves of cells in the pouched mashed potatoes at constant temperature (12-34 degrees C) were sigmoidal with time on a semi-logarithmic plot and were successfully described with a new logistic model recently developed by us. The rate constant of growth showed a highly linear relationship to the temperature with the square-root model, and the lag period was longer at lower temperatures. The growth curve in glass tubes containing a large volume of air was similar to that in pouches, showing that the rate of growth was not affected by the volume of the surrounding air. The growth curves in pouched mashed potatoes were very similar to those in nutrient broth or on the surface of nutrient agar, which we previously reported. These results suggested that the growth kinetics of the bacterial cells under various conditions of rich nutrition might be almost identical, and can be described with a simple growth model like ours.","741":"A determination method was developed for epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) and epoxidized linseed oil (ELO), which are used as plasticizers and\/or stabilizers, in wrapping film and cap sealings. The ESBO method reported by Castle et al. was improved. Samples were extracted with acetone-hexane (3: 7), transmethylated under alkaline conditions, then derivatized to the 1,3-dioxolanes and analyzed by GC\/MS. The recoveries of spiked ESBO and ELO were between 92.6% and 104.4%. The determination limits were 0.01 mg\/g for ESBO and 0.02 mg\/g for ELO in the wrapping film, and 0.04 mg\/g and 0.08 mg\/g in the cap sealing. ESBO and ELO were surveyed in 10 samples each of wrapping film and cap sealings currently available on the Japanese market. ESBO was found at 34.7-82.8 mg\/g in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) wrapping films and at 5.47-399 mg\/g in cap sealings. ELO was detected at 8.6-11.4 mg\/g in polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) wrapping films, and at 46.4 mg\/g in a PVC wrapping film.","742":"","743":"","744":"","745":"A survey of vitamin K contents was carried out on 41 aojiru products and 10 vegetable juice products that were purchased from local markets. Aojiru is a health food made from green vegetables such as kale, ashitaba, mulberry leaf, barley grass and the like. The products are usually provided in various forms, such as frozen, powder and tablet. Vitamin K in samples was extracted with n-hexane, and separated on a C18 column with methanol-ethanol (95 : 5). After separation, vitamin K was converted to the hydroquinone form on a reduction column and determined with a fluorescence detector at lambdaex 240 nm and lambdaem 430 nm. The contents of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) in frozen samples (n = 8), powder samples (n = 26) and tablet samples (n=7) were 90-190, 410-3,300, and 640-3,100 microg\/100 g, respectively, and that in vegetable juice (n= 10) was 1-12 microg\/100 g. Vitamin K2 (menaquinone) was not detected. The daily intake of vitamin K from aojiru products was estimated to be 99-380, 20-250 and 27-210 microg\/day for frozen, powder and tablet types, respectively. These results suggest that patients prescribed warfarin should take care about their intake of vitamin K from aojiru products.","746":"The induction of chromosome aberration of Ca-type Garcinia cambogia extract containing about 65% (-)-hydroxycitric acid was investigated by use of the chromosome aberration test in cultured Chinese hamster lung cells (CHL\/IU) and the micronucleus test in mice. In the chromosome aberration test, Ca-type Garcinia cambogia extract did not increase the number of cells with structural aberration and\/or numerical aberrations. The micronucleus test was carried out with bone marrow cells of Slc : ddY male mice after single oral administration of up to 2,000 microg\/kg. There was no significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. These results indicate that Ca-type Garcinia cambogia extract does not induce chromosome aberration.","747":"Sandarac resin, a natural gum base, is described as \"a substance composed mainly of sandaracopimaric acid obtained from the secretion of sandarac trees\" in the List of Existing Food Additives in Japan. To evaluate its quality as a food additive, the main constituents in a sandarac resin product were investigated. Three constituents were isolated and identified as sandaracopimaric acid, sandaracopimarinol and 4-epidehydroabietic acid by MS and 2D-NMR. Quantification of the main constituent, sandaracopimaric acid, was performed by HPLC and its content in the product was determined to be 11.6%.","748":"It has been mandatory to label five allergenic substances (AS; egg, milk, wheat, buckwheat and peanut) in all processed foods, since April 2002 in Japan. Two kinds of ELISA kits have been provided as screening test kits for the Japanese official method. The kits have many advantages but some disadvantages, i.e., the kits are not necessarily suitable for daily monitoring in food manufacturing plants, because they require various analytical equipments and the use of complicated procedures. To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed other diagnostic kits based on immunochromatography that should enable more rapid and simple screening for food allergens. Then we examined the performance of these immunochromatographic test kits (IC kits) in terms of sensitivity, repeatability and cross-reactivity to AS proteins in 11 kinds of food models with various heating conditions and physical properties. We also examined processed food models including AS protein of constant concentration, using the IC kits and ELISA kits, and compared the results. The IC kits detected AS proteins at 5 microg\/g in the extracts from processed food models, and provided highly reproducible results. Cross-reactivity among the AS proteins was not observed. The results obtained using the IC kits showed performance equivalent to that of the ELISA kits we examined in unheating processed food models including AS proteins of constant concentration. The IC kits should be more suitable for daily monitoring in food manufacturing plants.","749":"A sensitive and selective method using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS\/MS) was developed for the determination of chloramphenicol (CAP) in honey and royal jelly. Mass spectral acquisition was performed in the negative mode by applying multiple reaction monitoring. In LC separation, Mightyl RP-18GP and 10 mmol\/L ammonium acetate-acetonitrile were used as the column and mobile phase, respectively. CAP in honey samples was diluted with water, while CAP in royal jelly was extracted with 1% metaphosphoric acid-methanol (4 : 6). The solutions were cleaned up with an Oasis HLB cartridge. The quantification limits of CAP in honey and royal jelly were 0.3 ng\/g and 1.5 ng\/g, respectively. The recoveries of CAP from both honey and royal jelly at the quantification limits were over 92%. Twenty honey products and seven royal jelly products were analyzed by the developed method. CAP was detected in one honey product at 0.6 ng\/g and in six royal jelly products at the level of 1.5-17.8 ng\/g. These results show that the developed method has satisfactory sensitivity selectivity and is useful for the determination of CAP residues in honey and royal jelly.","750":"Levels of eight harmful elements, i.e., antimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium, were investigated in 45 baby toys and 10 paints, which were mainly made of polyvinyl chloride. All samples contained barium at levels of 0.3-3,700 mg\/kg, several samples contained cadmium (0.2-26 mg\/kg), chromium (0.5-280 mg\/kg) and lead (1.5-1,300 mg\/kg), and one sample contained antimony (5.3 mg\/kg). They might have been used as colorants of the toy materials and paints. They were then evaluated using the migration test of ISO 8124-3, in which samples were ground up, and then soaked in 0.07 mol\/L HCl at 37 degrees C for two hours. Barium, cadmium, chromium and lead migrated from some of the samples, but at levels lower than the migration limits required by ISO 8124-3. Compared with the Japanese official method, the ISO method resulted in higher migration, but there are significant differences in the migration limits, test method, and so on between them. Further investigation is needed in this area.","751":"A simple and rapid method was developed for the analysis of tetrodotoxin in puffer-fish tissues, and in serum and urine of humans poisoned after consuming puffer-fish, by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS). Tetrodotoxin was extracted with 2% acetic acid. The extracted solution from puffer-fish tissues was diluted with water, and the extracted solution from human serum and urine was cleaned up by LC\/MS\/MS with a methacrylate-styrenedivinylbenzene cartridge. The LC separation was performed on a C18 column (50 mm x 2.1 mm i.d.) using 10 mmol\/L IPCC-MS7-methanol (65 : 35) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL\/min. The mass spectral acquisition was done in the positive ion mode by applying selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The recoveries of tetrodotoxin were 79-90% from puffer-fish tissues fortified at 0.1 microg\/g and 1 microg\/g, and 93-101% from human serum and urine fortified at 0.5 ng\/mL and 5 ng\/mL. The detection limits of tetrodotoxin were 0.01 microg\/g in puffer-fish tissues and 0.1 ng\/mL in human serum and urine. Thirty samples of puffer-fish from wholesale markets, and 7 serum and 5 urine samples of humans poisoned after consuming puffer-fish were analyzed by this method. Tetrodotoxin was detected in all puffer-fish tissues, and all serum and urine samples at the levels of 0.04-140 microg\/g, 0.9-1.8 ng\/mL and 15-150 ng\/mL, respectively.","752":"The incidence and levels of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and thermostable direct hemolysin gene (tdh)-positive organisms in retail seafood were determined. The most probable number-polymerase chain reaction (MPN-PCR) method using a PCR procedure targeting the species-specific thermolabile hemolysin gene (tlh) and tdh was used to determine the levels of V. parahaemolyticus and tdh-positive organisms, respectively. In seafood for raw consumption, V. parahaemolyticus was found in four (13.3%) of 30 fish samples, 11 (55.0%) of 20 crustacean samples, and 29 (96.7%) of 30 mollusc samples. Levels of V. parahaemolyticus were below 10(4) MPN\/100 g in all fish and crustacean samples tested. However, they were above 10(4) MPN\/100 g in 11 (36.7%) of the 30 mollusc samples. In all seafood for raw consumption, the level of tdh-positive organisms was below the limit of detection (&lt; 30 MPN\/100 g). In seafood for cooking, V. parahaemolyticus was found in 15 (75.0%) of 20 fish samples, nine (45.0%) of 20 crustacean sample, and 20 (100%) of 20 mollusc samples. Levels of V. parahaemolyticus were above 10(4) MPN\/100 g in only three (15.0%) and one (5.0%) of the 20 fish and 20 crustacean samples, respectively. However, they were above 10(4) MPN\/100 g in 18 (90.0%) of the 20 mollusc samples. In seven (35.0%) of the 20 mollusc samples, tdh-positive organisms were found and their levels ranged from 3.6x10 to 1.1 x 103 MPN\/100 g. From four of seven tdhpositive samples, tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus was isolated.","753":"Lipophilic toxins associated with diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) in scallops, Patinopecten yessoensis, collected in Hokkaido, Japan were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\/MS). Pectenotoxin-6 (PTX6) and yessotoxin (YTX) were the dominant toxins in the scallops, although the percentages of these toxins were different depending on the production area or the sampling period. The quantitative results obtained for the scallops in LC\/MS and in mouse bioassay (MBA) were compared. Fifty of the 55 samples found to be exceeding the local quarantine level (0.025 MU\/g whole meat) in Hokkaido by LC\/MS were quantified by MBA as being below the quarantine level. It is suggested that this discrepancy is due to poor detection of YTX by MBA. These results indicate that LC\/MS is a better method than MBA in terms of sensitivity and accuracy to quantify known lipophilic toxins, including YTX.","754":"","755":"","756":"","757":"As a part of our studies on the mechanism of uptake of paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) and the kinetics of its accumulation in bivalves, oysters Crassostrea gigas were experimentally contaminated with PSP by being fed with the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days. Temporal variations in the PSP contents and their profiles in oysters during the feeding experiment were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the toxin profile of the oysters was compared with that of A. tamarense. Toxins excreted from the infested oysters into the seawater for 2 and 10 days were recovered and analyzed by HPLC. PSP toxicity rapidly appeared in the tissues of oysters and their toxicity levels reached 0.6 (0.3), 2.2 (1.1), 1.0 (0.5), 3.4 (1.6) and 1.1 (0.5) MU\/g (nmol\/g) shucked meat at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days, respectively. The accumulation rates of toxin, calculated from the total amount (nmol) of toxins expressed by the total cell number fed during the exposure period and the toxicity of the oysters, were 14.1, 18.7, 5.1, 14.9 and 3.2% for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days. During feeding experiments, the toxin profile of oysters changed substantially, showing marked differences from the proportions found in the toxigenic dinoflagellate used as food. The toxin components in this strain existed almost exclusively as beta-epimers, which accounted for 66.3 mol% of the total. This contrasts with the case of the oysters, where the beta-epimers represented 24.8, 29.8, 25.1, 27.3 and 25.2 mol% of the total at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days, respectively. The amount of gonyautoxin-1 (GTX1) accumulated in oysters increased linearly and slowly for 8 days and the maximum content of GTX1 reached 51.3 mol%. The composition of GTX group compounds recovered from the seawater in which the oysters had been reared was a little different from that within the oyster tissues.","758":"A laboratory-performance study was carried out to investigate factors affecting the reliability of the quantitative PCR method to analyze an approved genetically modified (GM) maize (Mon810 line). Test maize powdered samples were prepared as blind samples containing a high (assigned value; 5.45%) or low (assigned value; 0.35%) concentration of the Mon810 line. After confirmation of their homogeneity, they were provided to 27 laboratories participating in the collaborative study. The data were collected from all laboratories and statistically analyzed. Two laboratories, which used a Roche LightCycler (LC), reported significantly high test values. A further examination showed that the LC method is greatly affected by the equipment itself or PCR reagents, resulting in poor repeatability. On the other hand, some laboratories, which used ABI quantitative PCR equipment, reported erroneous test values. In these laboratories, the errors appeared to have been due to inadequate quality and\/or yield of DNA. To identify factors affecting the test values, analysis of the measured values for the taxon-specific gene will be useful. Furthermore, the modified silica-gel membrane DNA extraction method made it possible to extract the required amounts of DNA more easily and in a shorter time than before.","759":"Examination for CBH351 maize was conducted by the qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in maize grain and maize processed foods obtained in the Tokyo area. The numbers of samples possibly positive in the screening test were 7 of 22 (31.8%) for maize grain samples, 4 of 14 (28.6%) for semi-processed foods, 11 of 30 (36.7%) for canned products, 3 of 30 (10.0%) for maize snacks, 3 of 4 (75%) for tacos and 1 of 3 (33.3%) for tortillas. However, CBH351 maize was not detected in the confirmation test. Therefore, the results of the screening test were false-positive. Since the reaction might have been caused by the base sequences of the 3'-end of primers CaM03-5' and CBH02-3' used in the screening test, a new primer pair was designed. The PCR products obtained with the new primer pair TMC2-5'--TMS2-3' were specific for CBH351 and were not obtained with barley, wheat, rice, RRS, Bt11, or Event176. Thus, the new primer pair shows high specificity. CBH351 maize was detected from samples containing at least 0.05% CBH 351 maize DNA by using this primer pair.","760":"A PCR method for the effective detection of Coxiella burnetii in commercially available mayonnaise was developed. Sample preparations were isolated from 50 g portions of each mayonnaise product by four successive extraction steps in phosphate buffer with 2.0 M NaCl. These extracts were then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 60 min. DNA was isolated from the solution containing the precipitate with a commercial kit, and amplified quantitatively using real-time PCR that targeted the com1 region of C. burnetii. The recoveries of C. burnetii from 2 kinds of commercial mayonnaise specimens, with a baseline control of 1 x 10(7) particles of the Nine Mile phase II strain, were 85.0 +\/- 6.0% and 72.0 +\/- 0.4%, respectively. The determination limit of this method was 500 C. burnetii particles per 50 g of mayonnaise. The DNA specimens isolated from 50 different commercial mayonnaise samples sold in Tokyo using this method were amplified using both nested PCR and real-time PCR. No contamination by C. burnetii was detected in any of the mayonnaise samples.","761":"","762":"","763":"","764":"","765":"During a 3-year monitoring survey (April 2002-March 2005) of pesticide residues in agricultural products, 592 samples (324 domestic; 268 imported) collected in Hyogo prefecture, Japan were analyzed. The number of pesticides tested increased from 232 in FY 2002 to 323 in FY 2004. The purpose of the study was to clarify the residue status by accumulating information about pesticides detected frequently, to allow effective and efficient regulation under the new \"Positive List\" legislation to be implemented in FY 2006. Overall, 47% of domestic and 61% of imported samples contained detectable residues and ca. 60% of positive samples contained multiple residues. The limit of quantitation was set at 0.01 microg\/g and the limit of detection was 0.001-0.003 microg\/ g. Most of the residues were present at low concentrations: 80% of the detections in samples excluding imported citrus fruits were &lt; 0.05 microg\/g. More than 5 different pesticides (&gt; 0.01 microg\/g) were detected simultaneously in 13 samples. The sum of the ratios of residues to MRLs was calculated as one of the indexes to represent the risk of multiple residues, and they exceeded 100% in 3 imported frozen vegetables; baby kidney bean, spinach, Welsh onion. Samples in violation of the Food Sanitation Law were not found in our survey, but 1.9% of the samples might be in conflict with the new \"Positive List\" legislation.","766":"Fifty-two samples of broiled eels and broiled eel liver were analyzed for total mercury (total Hg) and methyl mercury. The mean concentrations of total Hg in broiled eels and broiled eel liver were 0.21 ppm and 0.10 ppm, respectively. Meanwhile, the mean concentrations of methyl mercury in broiled eels and broiled eel liver were 0.085 ppm and 0.039 ppm, respectively. The rate of methyl mercury to total Hg mainly ranged from 60 to 80% in broiled eels and from 35 to 65% in broiled eel liver. The total Hg concentrations of 2 samples of broiled eels and one sample of broiled eel liver exceeded the provisional regulation limit (0.4 ppm) of total Hg in fish in Japan. In these samples, the rates of methyl mercury to total Hg were lower than 20%. The muscles and the skin of broiled eels were measured separately. The ratios of skin to muscle concentration of total Hg and methyl mercury were mainly in the range from 1\/10 to 1\/4. The mean intakes of total Hg from broiled eels and broiled eel liver per individual were 24.6 microg and 3.1 microg, respectively.

The extract was diluted 4 times with water, and the diluted solution was passed through a C18 cartridge. The cartridge was washed with water and methanol-water (4 : 6), and then 4-hexylresorcinol was eluted with acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid (55 : 45). The eluate was separated on a Capcell Pak C18 MG column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid (6 : 4) and 4-hexylresorcinol was determined with a UV detector (210 nm). Recoveries of 4-hexylresorcinol from commercial prawn and crab meats spiked at 1.0 and 10 microg\/g were 82.4-92.2 and 88.9-91.8%, respectively.

Test samples containing 0, 1 and 5% GM soya powder in non-GM soya powder was prepared. A set of 3 test samples was sent to the participating laboratories along with the protocol. The data were collected from all laboratories and statistically analyzed. In the real-time PCR detection method, the average values of the GM 1% and 5% samples were both much lower than the spiked value because the laboratories using a silica-membrane DNA extraction method underestimated the GM value. On the other hand, the laboratories using other extraction methods, such as the CTAB method obtained values close to the spiked value. These results suggest that use of the silica-membrane DNA extraction method may result in underestimation of the GM content in the real-time PCR method. In the ELISA method, the average value of 5% spiked samples appears to be slightly higher than the fortified value. But, overall, it was considered that reported values were close to the spiked level.","773":"We have developed an analytical method for components of alpha-glucosyltransferase-treated stevia, a food additive product. Suitable conditions to separate additional sugar from alpha-glucosyltransferase-treated stevia by using glucoamylase were found (55 degrees C for 3 hr with 250 U of glucoamylase in 10 mL of reaction solution). By solid-phase extraction using a C18 cartridge column, polysaccharides were excluded from the sample, and the glycosides and sugar obtained after hydrolysis with glucoamylase were separated on another C18 cartridge column. The glycosides and sugar contents were determined by HPLC. By this method, additional sugar was detected in all of three product samples tested and the sugar was glucose. The contents of glucose and total glycosides (minus unreacted glycoside) were 25-42% and 35.7-52.5%, respectively. In alpha-glucosyltransferase-treated stevia, the sum of total glycosides and glucose amounted to 77.5-80.4% of the total and their recoveries from samples from which polysaccharide had been excluded by C18 cartridge column processing were over 85%. The contents of alpha-glucosyltransferase-treated stevia obtained by multiplying the sugar content by the coefficient (0.9) for hydrolysis and converting on dry weight basis were all over 80.0% and met the standard set by the Japan Food Additives Association.","774":"A total of 148 samples of nine species of fruit were collected between 1999 and 2002 and analyzed for PCDDs, PCDFs (PCDD\/Fs) and Coplanar PCBs. Sampling points within about 1 km of operational municipal waste incinerators that were considered sources of dioxins were defined as \"near-source\" areas, and all other sampling points were defined as \"general\" areas. The TEQ of apples collected from near-source areas was significantly higher than that from general areas (p &lt; 0.05). 3,3',4,4',5-PeCB (#126) was the main contributor to this difference in TEQs between apples collected from near-source areas and from general area. A principal component analysis performed to estimate the source of this congener revealed that not only the municipal waste incinerators, but also PCBs in the environment were associated with the high TEQ in apples collected from near-source areas. The daily intakes of PCDD\/Fs and Coplanar PCBs from the fruits including skin were estimated to be 0.0082 pg-TEQ\/kg b.w.\/day (ND = 0) and 0.072 pg-TEQ\/ kg b.w.\/day (ND = 1\/2 LOQ). Though these values are likely to be overestimates, they are far lower than the tolerable daily intake set in Japan for PCDD\/Fs and Coplanar PCBs (4 pg-TEQ\/kg b.w.\/day). It is thought that fruit intake is not an important pathway of human exposure to PCDD\/Fs and Coplanar PCBs.","775":"As a part of our studies on paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) accumulation kinetics in bivalves, short-necked clam Tapes japonia was experimentally contaminated with PSP by being fed with the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days, and the processes of PSP accumulation and bioconversion were investigated: the toxicity level was determined by mouse bioassay and toxin components were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The strain of A. tamarense used in this study possessed a specific toxicity of 186.7 +\/- 81 (mean +\/- S.D., n = 5) x 10(-6) MU\/cell. Total toxin concentration of this strain was 140.4 +\/- 61 (mean S.D., n = 5) fmol\/cell. The toxicity level of short-necked clams increased almost in parallel with the abundance of A. tamarense, reaching 1.8, 3.2, 3.8, 3.5 and 4.6 MU\/g meat for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days of feeding, respectively. The accumulation rates of PSP toxins, which are the ratio of the total amount of toxins accumulated in the bivalves to the estimated intake in each feeding experiment, were 7.5, 8.1, 5.7, 4.2 and 4.4% for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days, respectively. At the end of each exposure period, many undigested algal cells were found in pseudofeces under microscopic observation. There was a remarkable difference in the relative proportions of the predominant toxin components between A. tamarense and short-necked clams. The most notable difference was the change in the relative amounts of C2 (carbamoyl-N-sulfo-11beta-hydroxysaxitoxin sulfate), GTX1 and GTX 4 during the first two days. In the toxic bivalves, the amount of C2, which is dominant in A. tamarense, decreased to below half a percent after being ingested. Subsequently, the amount of GTX1 in the shellfish meat reached 50.1 mol%, while that of GTX4 decreased to about half of that in A. tamarense. As for the configuration of 11-hydroxysulfate, PSP components in A. tamarense exist almost exclusively as beta-epimers (GTX3, GTX4, C2 and C4), accounting for 72.8 mol% of the total. This contrasts with the case of the short-necked clams, where the beta-epimers represented 25.8, 33.8, 30.8, 36.8 and 28.5 mol% of the total after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days, respectively. PSP components seemed to be converted rapidly at an early stage of the feeding of A. tamarense.","776":"To assess levels of shellfish intoxication by the paralytic shellfish poison (PSP)-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense, potential health risks to human shellfish consumers and the possible need for regulatory intervention, yearly variations of maximum cell density of this species were examined from 1993 to 2004 in Kure Bay and Kaita Bay, which are located within Hiroshima Bay, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. The seawater temperature was determined concomitantly. In Kure Bay, maximum concentrations of 1,400 and 1,300 cells\/mL at 0 and 5 m depths were observed on 21 and 24 April 1997. In Kaita Bay, remarkably high concentrations above 1,000 cells\/mL of A. tamarense were observed in two out of three years investigated. These facts suggest that the environment in both bays is favorable for the propagation of A. tamarense. The temperature range at which the natural population of A. tamarense blooms was generally from 12 to 16 degrees C. Four strains (ATKR-94, -95, -97 and -01) from Kure Bay and one strain (ATKT-97) from Kaita Bay were established. The strain ATKR-94, cultured in modified SW-2 medium at 15 degrees C for 15 days, showed a specific toxicity of 33.8 x 10(-6) MU\/cell. The toxins in all five strains exist almost exclusively as beta-epimers (C2 (PX2 or GTX8), GTX3, dcGTX3 and GTX4), which accounted for 54.9 to 73.0 mol% of the total. The corresponding a-epimers (C1 (PX1 or epi-GTX8), GTX2, dcGTX2 and GTX1) accounted for 6.0 to 28.9 mol%. The toxin profiles of ATKR-97 and ATKT-97 were characterized by unusually high proportions of low-potency sulfocarbamoyl toxin, which comprised 62.4 and 68.2 mol%, respectively, of total toxins. In the toxic bivalves, the low-toxicity sulfocarbamoyl components, major components of A. tamarense, were present in amounts of only a few percent, suggesting that in vivo conversion of PSP occurs after ingestion. A comparison of the toxin profiles of the causative dinoflagellate and contaminated bivalves showed that PSP components exist in the bivalves in the form of alpha-epimers, presumably owing to accumulation or storage of the toxins.","777":"","778":"","779":"","780":"","781":"","782":"","783":"","784":"","785":"Suitable liquid chromatography\/mass spetrometry (LC\/MS) conditions were examined for Amaranth, Red 2G (R2G), Azo Rubine (Azo), Fast Red E (FRE) and Brilliant Blue FCF, which were detected in Akasu, a red vinegar made in Hong Kong from sake lees, on both thin layer chromatography (TLC) and photodiode array high-performance liquid chromatography (PDA-HPLC). Molecular-related ions for each dye were detected with excellent sensitivity by LC\/MS using electro-spray ionization with negative ion mode, capillary voltage 3.00 kV, cone voltage 50 V and desolvation temperature 400 degrees C. LC\/MS analysis of refined Akasu under these conditions enabled us to obtain clear mass spectra of R2G, Azo and FRE, which were present at trace levels in the Akasu.

For naturally contaminated apple juices, the relative standard deviations for repeatability and reproducibility were 3.2, 7.1% and 10.0, 21.7%, respectively. HORRAT values were 0.4, 0.9. The average recovery of patulin from spiked sample was 83.7%. The limit of quantification was calculated as 10 microg\/kg. From these results, the method was thought to be suitable as an official standard for determination of patulin in apple juice in Japan.","787":"Formaldehyde (FA), acetaldehyde (AA) and oligomers in recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were analyzed by HPLC. All of the physically recycled PET contained detectable levels of FA, AA and oligomers, and the levels were almost the same as in used bottles. Most superclean-like and chemically recycled PET contained lower levels than new pellets. These compounds showed no decrease upon physical recycling, but showed a marked decrease upon superclean-like recycling. In PET sheets made using physically recycled PET, FA was decreased, though AA was increased by the sheeting process as same as new one. FA, AA and oligomers originated from PET resin and their levels in recycled products were almost equivalent to those in new products. It was concluded that there is no particular safety concern about their presence in recycled PET.","788":"Tabletop dry ice coolers (three types; dome model, cap model and tripod model), which are used in kitchens and hotel banquet halls to refrigerate fresh seafood, were investigated to determine whether growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus was inhibited by their use. On TSA plates containing 1.8% NaCl and fresh seafood (fillets of squid, pink shrimp and yellowtail), V. parahaemolyticus (O3:K6, TDH+) inoculated at 4 to 5 log CFU\/sample and left at ambient temperature (25 degrees C) grew by 1.0 to 2.8 orders in 4 hours. In contrast, with tabletop coolers no significant increase in viable count occurred in 3 to 4 hours, confirming that tabletop coolers inhibited the growth of V. parahaemolyticus. The temperature in each tabletop cooler was kept below 10 degrees C for 80 to 135 min, though the CO2 gas concentration in them remained high for only a short time (0 to 75 min). It was presumed that the refrigeration function mainly contributed to growth inhibition. Our results indicate that tabletop dry ice coolers are helpful for prevention of food-borne disease due to V. parahaemolyticus in food-service locations, such as kitchens and banquet halls.","789":"Fungi growing on domestic rice were examined from April to June, 2003. One hundred samples of rice, which had been harvested in the autumn of 2002, were collected from the local market, and 15 samples of stored rice, which had been harvested in 2001 and stored in warehouses under government control, were used as samples. From each sample, 50 grains (100 grains in total) were plated on potato-dextrose agar (PDA) and malt yeast 40% sucrose agar (M40YA) containing chloramphenicol after being washed with sterile distilled water to remove any microorganisms on the surface, and incubated at 25 degrees C for a week. For most of the rice samples harvested in the preceding year, the proportion of grains infected with fungi was less than 20% of the total grains tested. In about half the samples of rice stored for one and half years, more than 80% of the grains were infected with fungi that grew on M40YA. The major genera of fungi isolated from the rice harvested in the preceding year were Penicillium and Alternaria, and those from the rice stored for one and a half years were Aspergillus, Penicillium and Eurotium. P. islandicum, A. versicolor, A. ochraceus and others were isolated as possible mycotoxin-producers in the mycoflora of domestic rice. P. islandicum was isolated from 3 samples, and 82% of the grains were infected with this fungus in one sample. All three isolates from these samples appeared to produce luteoskyrin on Czapek yeast extract agar, based on TLC and HPLC analysis.","790":"Jojoba wax is a natural gum base used as a food additive in Japan, and is obtained from jojoba oil with a characteristically high melting point. Although the constituents of jojoba oil have been reported, the quality of jojoba wax used as a food additive has not yet been clarified. In order to evaluate its quality as a food additive and to obtain basic information useful for setting official standards, we investigated the constituents and their concentrations in jojoba wax. LC\/MS analysis of the jojoba wax showed six peaks with [M+H]+ ions in the range from m\/z 533.6 to 673.7 at intervals of m\/z 28. After isolation of the components of the four main peaks by preparative LC\/MS, the fatty acid and long chain alcohol moieties of the wax esters were analyzed by methanolysis and hydrolysis, followed by GC\/MS. The results indicated that the main constituents in jojoba wax were various kinds of wax esters, namely eicosenyl octadecenoate (C20:1-C18:1) (1), eicosenyl eicosenoate (C20:1-C20:1) (II), docosenyl eicosenoate (C22:1-C20:1) (III), eicosenyl docosenoate (C20:1-C22:1) (IV) and tetracosenyl eiosenoate (C24:1-C20:1) (V). To confirm and quantify the wax esters in jojoba wax directly, LC\/MS\/MS analysis was performed. The product ions corresponding to the fatty acid moieties of the wax esters were observed, and by using the product ions derived from the protonated molecular ions of wax esters the fatty acid moieties were identified by MRM analysis. The concentrations of the wax esters I, II and III, in jojoba wax were 5.5, 21.4 and 37.8%, respectively. In summary, we clarified the main constituents of jojoba wax and quantified the molecular species of the wax esters without hydrolysis by monitoring their product ions, using a LC\/MS\/MS system.","791":"A simple and rapid method was developed for the screening of 82 pesticides\/metabolites in a wide variety of crops, using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS). After extraction with methanol, the filtered extracts were made up to 100 mL and a 2 mL aliquot was subjected to solid-phase extraction. Co-extractives were removed with a C18 mini-column, while pesticides were retained on 3 kinds of mini-columns (HLB, SAX, activated carbon), and then eluted with acetonitrile. Analysis was performed by LC\/MS\/MS, and MS acquisition parameters were established in positive and negative ESI modes. The utility of the method was demonstrated by the analysis of 6 crops (carrot, cabbage, onion, spinach, lemon, brown rice) and one mixed vegetable juice. Of 82 compounds tested, 75 in carrot and 62 in lemon were obtained with recoveries ranging from 70-120%. For all samples tested, 75 compounds could be obtained with recoveries of over 50%, and the detection limits of most compounds were lower than 0.01 microg\/g. This method provides acceptable performance for analysis of these 75 compounds. Further, by using aliquots of the extracts with small-scale mini-columns, purified samples could be obtained. This proposed method with small matrix effects, is effective and suitable for screening of multiple residual pesticides by using LC\/MS\/MS.","792":"","793":"","794":"","795":"","796":"","797":"","798":"","799":"","800":"","801":"Toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs\/DFs) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (CoPCBs) were analyzed in both crude (n = 5) and refined-hardening fish oils (n = 2), which are used in part as the raw materials of margarine and shortening, and in some retailed fish (n = 6), which may be similar to those used as sources of fish oil. PCDDs\/DFs-TEQ levels ranged from 0.1 to 13.5 pg TEQ\/g fat weight in crude fish oils, from 0.5 to 1.6 pg TEQ\/g fat weight in refined-hardening fish oils, and ranged from 1.4 to 31.2 pg TEQ\/g fat weight in retailed fish. The ranges of PCDDs\/DFs-TEQ in crude fish oils, in refined-hardening fish oils and in retailed fish overlapped each other. In addition, CoPCBs-TEQ levels ranged from 4.9 to 19.6 pg TEQ\/g fat weight in crude fish oils, from 0.2 to 1.4 pg TEQ\/g fat weight in refined-hardening fish oils, and from 2.7 to 165.8 pg TEQ\/g fat weight in retailed fish. TEQ levels of CoPCBs in refined-hardening fish oils were much lower than those in crude fish oils and in retailed fish. This was due to the lower concentrations of less-chlorinated congeners in refined-hardening fish oils, as compared to those in crude fish oils and retailed fish. It appears that less-chlorinated PCBs congeners in refined-hardening fish oils are partly removed during the refining process.","802":"The contents of nitrate and nitrite in vegetable juice (n = 63), tea beverage (n = 12) and mineral water (n = 15) were measured. The mean contents of nitrate were 0.73 +\/- 14.57 mg\/100 g, 0.61 +\/- 1.12 mg\/100 g and 0.25 +\/- 0.33 mg\/100 g as NO3-, respectively. The contents of the nitrite were 0.03 +\/- 0.05 mg\/100 g, 0.02 +\/- 0.01 mg\/100 g and 0.001 +\/- 0.001 mg\/100 g as NO2-, respectively. The content of nitrate is high in some vegetable juices, and warnings may be necessary for people who drink them frequently.","803":"An analytical method for residual sodium chlorite in several kinds of processed herring roe treated with sodium chlorite was studied. Sodium chlorite was extracted with 9 mmol\/L sodium carbonate. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 microm nylon filter. The filtrate was deproteinized by ultrafiltration and chloride ion was removed with an On-Guard Ag cartridge column. The eluate was subjected to conductivity detector-ion chromatography. Recoveries of sodium chlorite from herring roe spiked at the level of 5 mg\/kg were 88 +\/- 3.7% (n = 5, CV 4.2%). The method had a quantitation limit of 5 mg\/kg for processed herring roes.","804":"A rapid multiresidue method has been developed for determination of many pesticides in fruits and vegetables using GC\/MS and LC\/MS. The method of analysis was the same as that reported by Kakimoto et al. in 2003 except for the use of LC\/MS. Good recoveries in the range of 70-120% were obtained for 70 (32 by GC\/MS, 38 by LC\/MS) of 113 pesticides spiked at 0.1 microg\/g into fruits and vegetables. For screening purposes, the method could be appiled to 82 pesticides. Considering the report by Kakimoto et al. in 2004, 177 pesticides were suitable for screening by this method. The limits of detection were 0.001-0.015 microg\/g (by GC\/MS) and &lt; 0.001-0.010 microg\/g (by LC\/MS). The calibration curves were linear for most pesticides, with correlation coefficients of 0.976-1.000 (by GC\/MS) and 0.968-1.000 (by LC\/MS). The values obtained for fruits and vegetables naturally contaminated with pesticides by this method were nearly equal to those by the official method.","805":"To examine dioxin contamination in commercial baby foods in Japan, congener analyses of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCBs) were performed on 102 varieties of baby foods obtained from supermarkets in 2001-2002. The toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) levels for dioxins in samples ranged from &lt; 0.001 to 0.135 pg-TEQ\/g wet weight when undetected or trace levels of congeners were taken as zero. Among 102 samples tested, 26 samples exceeded 0.010 pg-TEQ\/g. The highest TEQ value was for \"sardine, vegetables\" (0.135 pg-TEQ\/g), followed by \"Japanese radish (daikon), sardine\" (0.080 pg-TEQ\/g). Thus, dioxins were detected at low levels in baby foods containing animal products such as fishes and\/or dairy products.","806":"Allergenic substances (egg and milk) were measured in processed meat products and frozen foods of which the milk and egg ingredient ratios and manufacturing processes were clearly identified. An ovomucoid ELISA kit gave good results in the detection of egg ingredients. With an ovalbumin ELISA kit and egg ELISA kit, results for 6 of 16 foods were negative, but better results were obtained when a protein denaturant was added to the extraction buffer. Occurrence of contamination in the egg ingredient manufacturing line was confirmed in frozen foods. For milk ingredients, good results were obtained by ELISA using two kinds of kits (a casein ELISA kit and milk ELISA kit) described as being suitable for detection of allergenic substances. Allergenic substances were identified by Western blot analysis in all of the foods containing egg and milk ingredients.","807":"Migration from multi-layer laminated film pouches intended for retort foods was investigated through HPLC analysis with a fluorescence detector, and measurements of residue on evaporation, consumption of potassium permanganate and total organic carbon. HPLC analysis revealed that the levels of migrants in oil and the water which were heated in the pouches (121 degrees C, 30 min) were ten times of those in the corresponding official simulants under the official conditions; n-heptane (25 degrees C, 60 min), and water (95 degrees C, 30 min). Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether and related compounds were found in the oil and the water heated in the pouches, as well as in the simulants. These compounds were thought to have been present in the adhesive between the laminated films, and migrated through the food-contact film of the package. Consumption of potassium permanganate and residue on evaporation of the heated water were ten times of those of the water simulant, while the total organic carbon level of the heated water was several-hold greater than that of the water simulant. In addition, migrant levels per surface area of the pouch were one-fourth of the concentrations per content volume of the pouch. Since compliance with the legal limits is evaluated based on the concentration per surface area, real migration into foods would be underestimated by a factor of another four.","808":"","809":"","810":"","811":"","812":"","813":"Food poisoning involving histamine has occurred almost every year for 20 years in Tokyo, and is usually due to ingestion of fish with lean meat, such as sardine, mackerel, horse mackerel and so on. Therefore, we were investigated the levels of histamine and 4 non-volatile amines (tyramine, putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine) in 637 samples on the market. The water activity of samples in which histamine was detected at 5 mg\/100 g and over was examined. Histamine, tyramine, putrescine, cadaverine and spermidine were detected in 66, 43, 26, 64 and 5 samples, and the detection ranges were 5-340, 5-51, 5-42, 5-180 and 5-8 mg\/100 g, respectively. Most of the samples in which histamine was detected were semi-dried round and split sardine. Water activity of 24 samples of semi-dried round and split sardine in which histamine was detected was in the range of 0.68-0.96.","814":"In the official method for determination of total bromine in fruit and grain foods, bromine is derivatized with 3-pentanone for GC analysis. Co-existing substances sometimes interfere with measurement of the derivative, though the method is highly selective. In this study, the notification method was modified to reduce impurity peaks by applying 3-hexanone. Samples were alkalized and reduced to ash in an electric furnace. After ashing, samples were oxidized with potassium permanganate solution and derivatized with 3-hexanone. The calibration curve was linear from 0.1 microg\/mL up to 5.0 microg\/mL. The detection limit (S\/N = 10) was 0.1 microg\/mL, i.e., 5 microg\/g for herb, 2.5 microg\/g for grains and 1.0 microg\/g for fruits. The recoveries of bromine from fruit, grain foods and herbs added at the levels of 5 to 25 microg\/g ranged from 84.2 to 96.9%. The values of relative standard deviation (RSD) were from 1.4 to 6.3%. This method should be useful for routine examination of total bromine in foods.","815":"Malonaldehyde (MA) content in plain bread, French bread, and croissants was analyzed. MA was detected in all the analyzed samples. The MA and lipid contents in croissants were higher than those in other breads. Changes in MA content in plain bread, French bread, and croissants stored at 4 degrees C were examined after 0, 2, and 4 days of storage. The MA content in all the bread samples increased during the storage period. The highest increase of MA content was observed in French bread.","816":"CFR and JECFA specify that the total color in FD&amp;C Blue No. 2 (B2; Indigo Carmine, Indigotine, Food Blue No. 2) is not less than 85%, its isomer (B2iso) in B2 is not more than 18%, and its subsidiary color (B2sub) in B2 is not more than 2% (CFR) or 1% (JECFA). Japan's Specifications and Standards for Food Additives, 7th Edition, specifies that the total color in B2 is not less than 85.0% and other color materials in B2 are not detected by paper chromatography. LC\/MS and HPLC were employed to identify and determine the main component (B2m) of B2, B2iso, and B2sub. The pseudo molecular ions (B2m and B2iso: [M-2Na+H]-, m\/z=421; B2sub: [M-Na]-, m\/z=341) of each color material were obtained and identified by LC\/MS based on their absorptions and mass spectra. The contents of B2iso and B2sub in B2 samples (certified samples from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2002) were determined by HPLC using calibration curves for the standards of B2m and B2iso. The contents of B2iso in most samples were less than 10%, and the contents of B2sub in all samples were not more than 1%. All of them were within the regulatory limits set by the CFR and JECFA.","817":"Metals in recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were analyzed by ICP-MS following microwave digestion with nitric acid. Physically and superclean-like recycled PET contained both Ge and Sb, and sometimes contained Co, P or Si. In contrast, the chemically recycled PET contained only Ge or Sb, and some samples contained Co. The recycled PETs did not contain Pb or Cd. Ge and Sb were catalysts of the polymerization, and the other metals also originated from the PET resin as additives. It was concluded that there is no safety concern about metals in recycled PET. It became clear that the presence of both Ge and Sb could identify products formed using physically or superclean-like recycled PET. According to this discrimination method, about half of the sheet molding products used recycled PET.","818":"A GC\/MS method for congener-specific analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in food samples was evaluated. There was good agreement between total concentration of PCBs in fish samples (n = 16) measured by using the GC\/MS method and the conventional GC-ECD method. The total diet study samples (fishery food, meat, egg, milk, and their products) collected from Osaka in 1982-2001 were analyzed by using the GC\/MS method to estimate the temporal trend of daily intake of PCBs from food. The estimated daily intake of total PCBs (sum of tri- to heptaCBs) was in the range of 0.7-4.4 microg\/person\/day, far below the Japanese provisional acceptable daily intake (250 microg\/50 kg-person\/day). The dominant congener was 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (#153), which accounted for 9-15% of total PCB. The ratio of lower chlorinated congeners decreased from the 1980's to post-2000. The results indicate that the PCB congener profile in foods has gradually changed.","819":"Hajikami (ginger pickled in vinegar) is often used as a relish for grilled fish, and it often contains coloring agents. We detected Rose Bengal (R105) and two unknown dyes in some Hajikami by thin layer chromatography. In this study, we tried to characterize these unknown dyes by HPLC with photodiode array detection (PDA-HPLC), liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). PDA-HPLC analysis showed that the spectra of the unknown dyes resembled that of R105, suggesting the molecular structures of these two dyes are similar to that of R105. Furthermore, LC\/MS analysis suggested that the these dyes are R105 in which one or two iodines are replaced by hydrogen. Finally, the two dyes were determined by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR to be 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-3',6'-dihydroxy-2',7'-diiodo spiro[isobenzofuran- 1 (3H),9'-[9H]xanthen]-3-one disodium salt and 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-3',6'-dihydroxy-2',7'-diiodo spiro[isobenzofuran-1(3H),9'[9H]xanthen]-3-one disodium salt.","820":"A total of 244 milk samples collected from supermarkets in Tokyo were examined for contamination with Coxiella burnetii. C. burnetii DNA was detected in 131 (53.7%) of the samples by nested PCR. PCR-positive samples were injected into immunosuppressed A\/J strain mice. Of the 22 PCR-positive milk samples tested, none resulted in isolation of C. burnetii from the mice. Heat-treatment was sufficient to inactivate C. burnetii in commercial milk. In addition, a PCR detection method for C. burnetii in chicken egg was developed. Egg yolk was added to an equal volume of 1 mol\/L of NaCl phosphate buffer and homogenized for removal of protein and lipid. After centrifugal separation, the supernatant was removed, and template DNA in the precipitate was extracted using SDS, proteinase K and NaI. Using such prepared samples, 3.2 x 10(1) C. burnetii particles in 1 g of egg yolk could be detected by nested PCR. All of 200 chicken egg samples collected from supermarkets in Tokyo were negative for C. burnetii by the nested PCR method.","821":"Investigations of the validity of labeling regarding genetically modified (GM) products were conducted using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for foreign-made processed foods made from corn and potato purchased in the Tokyo area and in the USA. Several kinds of GM crops were detected in 12 of 32 samples of processed corn samples. More than two GM events for which safety reviews have been completed in Japan were simultaneously detected in 10 samples. GM events MON810 and Bt11 were most frequently detected in the samples by qualitative PCR methods. MON810 was detected in 11 of the 12 samples, and Bt11 was detected in 6 of the 12 samples. In addition, Roundup Ready soy was detected in one of the 12 samples. On the other hand, CBH351, for which the safety assessment was withdrawn in Japan, was not detected in any of the 12 samples. A trial quantitative analysis was performed on six of the GM maize qualitatively positive samples. The estimated amounts of GM maize in these samples ranged from 0.2 to 2.8%, except for one sample, which contained 24.1%. For this sample, the total amount found by event-specific quantitative analysis was 23.8%. Additionally, Roundup Ready soy was detected in one sample of 21 potato-processed foods, although GM potatoes were not detected in any sample.","822":"A simple and rapid method for the simultaneous determination of nine kinds of sweeteners (acesulfame potassium, AK; sucralose, SUC; saccharin, SA; cyclamate, CYC; aspartame, APM; dulcin, DU; glycyrrhizic acid, GA; stevioside, STV; rebaudioside A, REB) in various foods by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC\/ESI-MS) was developed. The LC separation was performed on a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 (2.1 mm x 150 mm) with a mobile phase of 5 mmol\/L dibutylammonium acetate (DBAA) and acetonitrile-water (8: 2). Mass spectral acquisition was done in the negative ion mode by applying selected ion monitoring (SIM). The sweeteners were extracted from foods with 0.08 mol\/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)- ethanol (1:1), and the extract was cleaned up on a Sep-pak Vac C18 cartridge after the addition of tetrabutylammonium bromide and phosphate buffer (pH 3.0). The recovery of the nine kinds of sweeteners from five kinds of foods fortified at the level 0.01 g\/kg, 0.05 g\/kg and 0.20 g\/kg was 75.7-109.2%, and the between-day SD values were 0.5-10.9%. The quantification limits of AK, SA, CYC, APM and STV were 0.001 g\/kg, and those of SUC, DU, GA and REB were 0.005 g\/kg. A recovery test from each cleaned-up sample solution was necessary to detect ionization suppression.","823":"Identification and determination of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), propyl gallate (PG) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) by means of LC\/MS and GC\/MS were examined. These five phenolic antioxidants were detected as their pseudo-molecular ions [M-H]- by LC\/MS using a Shim-pack FC-ODS column with drying gas. Moreover, BHA, BHT and TBHQ were detected based on their mass fragment ions by GC\/MS. Decomposition of TBHQ, NDGA and PG during analysis could be prevented by the addition of L-ascorbic acid (AsA) to the extraction solvent. All five antioxidants were extracted from nikuman, olive oils, peanut butter, pasta sauce and chewing gum with a mixture of acetonitrile-2-propanol-ethanol (2:1:1) containing 0.1% AsA (AsA mixture), which had been cooled in a freezer and filtered. One part filtrate and 5 parts water were mixed and placed on a Mega-Bond Elut C18 cartridge, except in the case of chewing gum. Lipids in foods were removed on a C18 cartridge by washing with 5 mL of 5% acetic acid, and antioxidants were eluted with 5 mL of AsA mixture. The antioxidants spiked into nikuman, olive oil, peanut butter, pasta sauce and chewing gum were successfully identified and their concentrations determined by LC\/MS, and GC\/MS with good recoveries.","824":"Many vegetables produced in Japan contain large amounts of nitrate that may be converted into nitrite in the oral cavity and afford carcinogenic nitrosamines in the stomach. On the other hand, vegetables contain ascorbate and other components that may affect the formation of nitrosamines. In this study, nitrosamine formation from vegetables with high nitrate content produced in Japan was examined under simulated oral cavity and stomach conditions. Extracts of chingensai, komatsuna and itomitsuba were digested with nitrate reductase and subsequently treated with an excess of morpholine at pH 3.0. The amount of N-nitrosomorpholine produced from each of the vegetable extracts was not affected by the vegetable components in the extracts. Addition of a large amount of ascorbate was required to decrease nitrosamine formation from the extract. The results indicated that nitrosamine formation from these vegetables could not be prevented by other components in the vegetables.","825":"A suitable positive control was investigated for histochemical assay (GUS-examining method) to detect genetically modified (GM) papaya (55-1), currently undergoing a safety assessment in Japan. Six different kinds of test papers were soaked with beta-glucuronidase solution and examined for GUS activity. The test papers made of nylon and glass fiber turned blue, and were stable for fifteen months at -20 degrees C. They are concluded to be useful as positive controls in the GUS-examining method for inspection of GM papaya (55-1).","826":"Since June 6, 2002, psilocin and psilocybin-containing fungi (commonly called \"magic mushrooms\") have been regulated by the Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law in Japan. However, various fly agaric-related products are now entering the Japanese market via the internet. In this study, fly agaric-related products available in this way were investigated for raw materials by DNA analysis and for additives by chemical analysis. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the mitochondrial 12S rDNA region suggested that these fly agaric-related products originate from A. muscaria or A. muscaria var. persicina. Furthermore, they were classified into three strains based on the ITS2-LSU nucleotide sequence. Harmine derivatives and\/or tryptamine derivatives were detected in some of these products by LC\/MS analysis. In accordance with this, the matK gene of Peganum harmala was found in all of the harmine derivative-containing samples.","827":"In an outbreak of food poisoning involving a dried purple laver product (called nori), four persons had allergic-like symptoms such as inflammation and red rash on their face, mouth and belly. The causative nori was extracted and smeared on the arm-skin of five volunteers. Three out of five volunteers had a slight allergic reaction after 5 to 30 min when they were exposed to sunlight. The levels of the chlorophyll derivatives, pheophorbide a and pyropheophorbide a, measured by HPLC were 851-906 and 5,460-5,624 microg\/g, respectively, in the causative samples. Judging from the high contents of pyropheophorbide a and pheophorbide a and the symptoms of patients and volunteers, the causative agents were concluded to be the photosensitizers pyropheophorbide a and pheophorbide a.","828":"Unknown peaks were detected in the chromatogram of garland chrysanthemum extract in analysis of organophosphorus pesticide residues. The unknown peaks were identified as isomers of tricresyl phosphate (TCP) by GC\/MS. TCP is used as a plasticizer in polyvinyl chloride, and there is no report of its detection in foods. Therefore, we investigated the origin of TCP detected in garland chrysanthemum. We found no effect of contact with packaging film or polyvinyl chloride sheet used in greenhouses. However, TCP was detected at 0.03 microg\/g (average) in 16 of 20 samples of garland chrysanthemum that had been in contact with polyvinyl chloride tubing used for warming greenhouses. These results indicate that TCP migrated to the garland chrysanthemum from the tubing used to keep greenhouses warm.","829":"Acrylamide (AAm) is formed from asparagine (Asn) and reducing sugar during cooking of foods at high temperature. We examined the formation of AAm in a model system using a glass fiber filter paper, and looked for suitable conditions for inhibiting AAm formation. In frying, the formation rate was about 10 times that in a moistureless oven. Increase of frying temperature and frying time increased AAm formation when the residual moisture was 5% or less. AAm increased with increasing amount of glucose (Glc) addition up to 1:1 with respect to Asn, but then decreased. On the other hand, in the case of fructose, as the amount added was increased, AAm increased accordingly. The AAm formation rate with respect to Asn increased when valine (Val) was co-present in a Glc and Asn reaction system. Cysteine and lysine inhibited the AAm formation rate. Pathways for the formation of AAm are proposed.","830":"","831":"","832":"Isophorone (ISP) is used widely as a solvent of natural and synthetic resins, wax, printing ink, pesticides and paints. In this study, the level of ISP in various foods (93 samples) was analyzed. ISP was collected from samples by steam distillation after the addition of an internal standard, deuterium-labeled ISP, then extracted with dichloromethane, cleaned up on a silica gel column, and determined by GC\/MS. ISP was barely detected in fish, meat and vegetable samples, but it was detected in rice, wheat, beans and their processed products, miso, soy sauce and fermented soybeans (natto). The maximum level was 8.9 ng\/g in miso. The packaging materials of the foods contained little ISP, and so the source of ISP in the foods could not be clarified.","833":"To investigate important factors affecting the reliability of the analytical results, proficiency tests were attempted for the histochemical method (GUS method) and the qualitative PCR method (PCR method) to detect genetically modified papaya (55-1) in the Japanease official method. The test samples were distributed to twenty-three laboratories that participated in the study and were examined according to the protocol. All the data collected from participating laboratories were statistically analyzed. In the PCR method, one negative sample was detected as positive using detection primers in one laboratory, though the sample was negative when checked using confirmation primers. Contamination might have occurred in the step of the preparation of the PCR sample solution using detection primers. In the GUS method, all the test samples were identified as expected. Thus, all the laboratories reported correct results overall.","834":"The residual volatiles in recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were analyzed using headspace\/GC\/MS. Recycled PET samples were made from PET bottles used for beverages, alcohol and soy sauce, and they were recycled in physical recycling plants, chemical recycling plants and superclean-like recycling trials. The physically recycled PET flakes contained small amounts of volatiles such as ethanol, limonene, 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane, acetone, octanal and nonanal. Most of them originated from foods packed in bottles, and only 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane was derived from polymer impurities. In contrast, the superclean-like or chemically recycled PET contained no detectable volatiles, like new PET pellets. The PET sheets shaped from physically recycled PET had no detectable volatiles. Not only the chemically and superclean-like recycled PET, but also the physically recycled PET contained no hazardous volatiles. It was concluded that there is no safety concern about volatiles in recycled PET, for the present use.","835":"A headspace GC\/MS analysis method for the simultaneous determination of residual vinyl chloride (VC) and vinylidene chloride (VDC) in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) products was developed. A test sample was swelled overnight with N,N-dimethylacetamide in a sealed vial. The vial was incubated for 1 hour at 90 degrees C, then the headspace gas was analyzed by GC\/MS using a PLOT capillary column. The recoveries from spiked PVC and PVDC samples were 90.0-112.3% for VC and 85.2-108.3% for VDC. The determination limits were 0.01 microg\/g for VC and 0.06\/microg\/g for VDC, respectively. By this method, VC was detected in two PVC water supply pipes at the levels of 0.61 and 0.01 microg\/g. On the other hand, VC and VDC were not detected in any of the food container-packages or toys tested.","836":"The effect of heat treatments on food products related to soybean curd contaminated with Bacillus cereus spores was investigated for the purpose of preventing food-poisoning outbreaks by B. cereus. In the case of B. cereus strains isolated from foods, heating foods inoculated with the spores for 20 min at 70 degrees C, 5 min at 75 degrees C, 2 min at 100 degrees C, or 10 sec with a microwave oven plus reheating after standing for 2 hr at 25 degrees C reduced the number of surviving cells within the foods to less than one-hundredth. In the case of a heat-resistant strain isolated from a food poisoning outbreak, heating for 20 min at 70 degrees C plus reheating after standing for 1.5-2 hr at 35 degrees C, heating for 10 min at 75 degrees C plus reheating after standing for 1.5-2 hr at 35 degrees C, or heating for 2 min at 100 degrees C plus reheating after standing for 4 hr at 25 degrees C was effective. There was not much difference between the flavor components in foods with and without heat treatment at 70 degrees C, as analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These results indicate that these heat treatments are available to control B. cereus spores, without affecting the sensory quality of the foods.","837":"","838":"","839":"","840":"","841":"","842":"Daily intakes of 12 phenols which are possible endocrine disruptors were estimated in hospital meals from 2000 to 2001. 4-Nonylphenol (4-NP (mix)) and bisphenol A (BPA) were detected at levels of 5.0 to 19.4 ng\/g and 0.2 to 1.1 ng\/g, respectively. 4-tert-Butylphenol, 4-n-pentylphenol, 4 -tert-pentylphenol, 4-n-hexylphenol, 4-n-heptylphenol and 4-tert-octylphenol were detected at levels of 0.1 to 2.4 microg\/g. The daily intakes of 4-NP (mix) and BPA were 5.8 microg\/day and 0.42 microg\/day, respectively. The daily intakes of other phenols were less than 1 microg\/day.","843":"The modified Rankine colorimetric method for measuring sulfite added to food as a food additive has a low determination limit and is little influenced by interfering substances from foods. However, it can give erroneous results for foods containing Liliaceae Allium. So, four different methods, alkaline titration, a colorimetric method, ion chromatography and qualitative analysis with potassium iodate-starch paper, were examined. It was found that the sodium azide used in the colorimetric method forms sulfur dioxide during bubbling and heating. The proposed colorimetric method can be applied to food containing sulfur compounds, if sodium azide is omitted and 1% triethanolamine solution is used as an absorbent instead of 0.1 mol\/L sodium hydroxide solution.","844":"Inter-laboratory evaluation studies were conducted for ELISA methods for allergic substances (peanuts). Extracts of biscuit, sauce, chocolate and butter spiked with peanut standard protein at a level of 5-20 ng\/mL as sample solutions were analyzed in replicate in 10 laboratories. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of the ELISA methods using a Peanut Protein ELISA Kit (Peanut kit) and a FASTKIT Peanut ELISA kit (Peanut ELISA kit) were mostly below 10%. Mean recoveries of the peanut standard protein from the food extracts were over 40% in the two ELISA methods. Repeatability relative standard deviations of peanut standard protein in four food extracts were in the ranges of 15.2-49.7% and 3.0-28.3% for the Peanut kit and the Peanut ELISA kit, respectively. Reproducibility relative standard deviations of peanut standard protein in four food extracts were 23.5-44.4%, 9.6-28.4% for the Peanut kit and the Peanut ELISA kit, respectively. The detection limits of both ELISA methods were 2-2.5 ng\/mL in sample solutions. These results suggested that the notified ELISA methods are reliable and reproducible for the inspection of peanut protein levels in extracts of biscuit, sauce, chocolate and butter.","845":"An analytical method for the determination of 32 kinds of pesticide residues in onions, Welsh onions and mushrooms using gas chromatograph with an atomic emission detector (GC-AED) was developed. The pesticides were extracted with acetone-n-hexane (2:3) mixture. The crude extract was partitioned between 5% sodium chloride and ethyl acetate-n-hexane (1:4) mixture. The extract was passed through a Florisil mini-column for cleanup with 10 mL of acetone-n-hexane (1:9) mixture. Although the sensitivity of GC-AED was inferior to that of GC-ECD, GC-AED has a superior element-selectivity. Therefore pesticide residues in foods could be analyzed more exactly by using GC-AED. Thirty-two pesticides including chlorine in onion, Welsh onion and shiitake mushroom were detected without interference. Recoveries of these pesticides from samples determined by GC-AED were 64-114%, except for a few pesticides.","846":"Inter-laboratory evaluation studies were conducted for the ELISA methods for allergic substances (buckwheat). Extracts of snack, bun and udon spiked with buckwheat standard protein at a level of 5-20 ng\/mL as sample solutions were analyzed in replicate at 10 laboratories. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of the ELISA methods using a Buckwheat Protein ELISA Kit (Buckwheat kit) and a FASTKIT Buckwheat ELISA kit (Buckwheat ELISA kit) were mostly below 10%. Mean recoveries of the buckwheat standard protein from the food extracts were over 40% in the two ELISA methods. Repeatability relative standard deviations of buckwheat standard protein in three food extracts were in the ranges of 6.8-78.5% and 5.0-33.9% for the Buckwheat kit and the Buckwheat ELISA kit, respectively. Reproducibility relative standard deviations of buckwheat standard protein in three food extracts were 11.9-69.5% and 16.5-34.1% for the Buckwheat kit and the Buckwheat ELISA kit, respectively. The detection limits of both ELISA methods were 1 ng\/mL in sample solutions. These results suggest that the notified ELISA methods are reliable and reproducible for the inspection of buckwheat protein levels in extracts of snack, bun and udon.","847":"A simple method for analysis of trichothecenes [Type A: diacetoxyscirpenol, neosolaniol, HT-2 toxin, and T-2 toxin, Type B: deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fusarenon-X, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivarenol] in barley tea and beer using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) was developed. Trichothecenes were extracted with ethyl acetate-methanol (19:1). The solvent was evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in water-methanol (3:1) for injection into the LC\/MS\/MS. The LC separation was performed with an octadecylated silica column at a flow-rate of 0.2 mL\/min, using a mobile phase consisting of water, methanol and acetonitrile. MS\/MS was used in multiple reaction monitoring, employing electrospray ionization (ESI-MRM). The recoveries of trichothecenes from drinks at 1 microg\/L (Type A) and 10 microg\/L (Type B) were 52.5-115.2% (barley tea) and 68.1-127.5% (beer). Five barley tea and ten beer samples were analyzed by this method. Trichothecenes were not detected in them. This method may have applications in quality assurance.","848":"Headspace GC using the standard addition method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of organic solvents in natural flavorings. The procedure can be outlined as follows: an aliquot of the sample is transferred to a 10 mL vial. To each vial, a DMSO solution containing solvents at different concentrations is added as the standard solution. The vials are kept at 50 degrees C (for automatic injection) or 40 degrees C (for hand-operated injection) for 40 minutes. One mL of the vapor phase in each vial is injected into a gas chromatograph equipped with an Aquatic-2 column (0.25 mm i.d. x 60 m). To evaluate this method, we conducted a performance study in collaboration with 10 laboratories, using ginger oleoresin. We analyzed 6 solvents (methanol, 2-propanol, acetone, dichloromethane, hexane, and 1,1,2-trichloroethene) for which the maximum residue limits are established in Japan's Specifications and Standards for Food Additives. Methanol and acetone existed in the ginger oleoresin, so only the other that four kinds of solvents were added to it. Eight of the laboratories used automatic injection, while the remaining two used hand-operated injection. Statistical analyses were conducted on the data obtained from the 8 laboratories. Repeatability standard deviations (RSDr) ranged from 4.3 to 11.4%, and reproducibility standard deviations (RSDR) ranged from 8.4 to 19.0%.","849":"In previous papers, we showed that Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) induced hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity, in particular pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD; corresponding to CYP2B type) in rats, and that GBE influenced the efficacy of co-administered drugs. In this study, to clarify the nature of the induction, we examined the effects of GBE samples from different sources and some major constituents of GBE on rat hepatic CYP in vitro and in vivo. In the study in vitro, eight GBE samples dose-dependently inhibited PROD activity in microsomes prepared from GBE-treated rats, and the inhibitory ratio correlated well with the content of proanthocyanidin in the GBE samples. Moreover, among six GBE constituents examined, proanthocyanidin markedly inhibited the PROD activity. However, administration of two GBE extracts with different proanthocyanidin contents to rats induced hepatic CYP activity, including PROD, to similar extents, and proanthocyanidin alone did not induce PROD activity. Furthermore, GBE samples extracted with both acetone-water and ethanol-water showed similar induction of CYPs in rats in vivo. These results suggest that most GBE samples available in Japan induce CYPs in rats regardless of the preparation method of the GBE, and that proanthocyanidin is not responsible for the induction. Further studies will be necessary to identify the constituent(s) of GBE involved in the induction of CYPs in vivo.","850":"A reliable analytical method for the simultaneous determination of dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate and dl-alpha-tocopherol in foods was established by HPLC using post-column photochemical reaction with UV and fluorescence detection. For low-fat food such as fruit juice and vegetable sauce, the tocopherols were extracted with methanol containing 0.1% ascorbic acid and the extract solution was injected into the HPLC. For fatty foods such as butter and margarine, the tocopherols were extracted with a mixed solvent of acetonitrile-2-propanol (9:1) containing ascorbic acid. The extract was cleaned up using a Sep Pak plus C18 cartridge and the eluent from the cartridge was injected into the HPLC. The peaks corresponding to tocopherols on the chromatogram were confirmed by comparing their UV spectra with those of the standard mixture at lamp-on and lamp-off of the photochemical reactor. The recoveries of tocopherols from low-fat foods (orange juice and barbecue sauce) fortified at levels of 10 and 100 microg\/kg each were 88.3 to 105.8% (RSD 0.5 to 6.0%) and those from the fatty foods (peanut butter and margarine) fortified at 100 microg\/kg each were 57.1 to 88.3% (RSD 3.0 to 6.4%). The determination limits corresponded to 10 microg\/kg of the tocopherols in the low-fat foods and 20 microg\/kg in the fatty foods.","851":"","852":"Japan's Specifications and Standards for Food Additives, 7th Edition (JSFA-VII) does not set limits for total contents of water-soluble chlorides and water-soluble sulfates (water-soluble inorganic salts) in food color aluminum lakes (FC-Als). However, the regulatory limit is 2% in JECFA and CFR. We used column switching suppressor-type ion chromatography (CSS-IC) for determination of anions. The total contents of water-soluble inorganic salts in FC-Als (112 qualified samples) were determined using the modified CSS-IC from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2003. Total contents of water-soluble inorganic salts in four samples exceeded 2%. From an international point of view, it is desirable that the total content of water-soluble inorganic salts in FC-Al should again be regulated in Japan.","853":"Contents of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in native species of potato (May Queen, Danshaku and Waseshiro), and in species (Jagakids Red '90 (Red) and Jagakids Purple '90 (Purple)) on the market, and their change during storage at room temparature were investigated. alpha-Solanine and alpha-chaconine were extracted from potatoes with methanol, cleaned up by using a Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridge, and then subjected to HPLC. The recoveries of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potatoes were both more than 96%, and the quantitation limits were both 2 microg\/g. alpha-Solanine and alpha-chaconine were detected in periderm in all samples at the levels of 260-320 microg\/g in May Queen,190-240 microg\/g in Danshaku, 43-63 microg\/g in Waseshiro, 140-200 microg\/g in Red and 84-130 microg\/g in Purple, respectively. alpha-Solanine and alpha-chaconine were detected in the cortex in all samples of May Queen and Danshaku at the levels of 2.7-12 microg\/g and 5.8-31 microg\/g, respectively. Contents of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in the cortex of May Queen and Danshaku were less than 10% of those in the periderm. When potatoes were stored for 90 days at room temparature in a dark place, no marked change in the contents of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine was observed in any of the potato samples.","854":"A study was conducted to evaluate the applicability of ICP-MS techniques for determination of metals in brown rice and fish. Cadmium, lead, mercury, arsenic, selenium, manganese, copper and zinc were determined by this method. An open digestion with nitric acid (Method A) and a rapid open digestion with nitric acid and hydrochloric acid (Method B) were used to solubilize analytes in samples, and these procedures were followed by ICP-MS analysis. Recovery of certified elements from standard reference materials by Method A and Method B ranged from 92 to 110% except for mercury (70 to 100%). Analytical results of brown rice and fish samples obtained by this ICP-MS agreed with those obtained by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The results of this study demonstrate that quadrupole ICP-MS provides precise and accurate measurements of the elements tested in brown rice and fish samples.","855":"A simple and rapid test has been developed to quantitatively measure the migration of antimony (Sb) and germanium (Ge) from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) products. The PET product was soaked in 4% acetic acid (2 mL\/cm2) for 30 min at 60 degrees C and 95 degrees C. The test solution was analyzed by ICP-MS. Recoveries of spiked Sb (0.025 microg\/mL) and Ge (0.05 microg\/mL) were 101% and 100%, respectively, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.3% and 1.7%. In ten successive analyses, Sb and Ge in the 4% acetic acid solution were analyzed with RSDs of 1.7% and 2.2%. Sb and Ge were not subject to interference from other elements simultaneously present in the 4% acetic acid solution. This method is simple, rapid and safe, requiring no pretreatment or use of the hazardous solvent carbon tetrachloride. Therefore, this test is a useful method to analyze Sb and Ge migration from PET products.","856":"Four unknown peaks were detected in GC chromatograms during analysis of organophosphorus pesticide residues in foods. They were identified by using GC\/MS as triethyl phosphate (TEP), tributyl phosphate (TBP), diphenyl 2-ethylhexyl phosphate (DPEHP) and N-ethyltoluenesulfoneamide (NETSA), which are used as plasticizers or flame retardants in food packaging. These chemical substances were detected in the range of tr. (below 0.01 microg\/g) to 11 micro\/g from 29 samples, and they were also detected in the packaging. It was supposed that they were transferred to the foods from the packaging. Furthermore, they were detected in some cereals and cereal products which contain fat and had been preserved for a long time.","857":"A simple method for analysis of fumonisin B1 (FB1) and fumonisin B2 (FB2) in beer and raw materials of beer using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) was developed. Samples were prepared and purified by using solid-phase extraction columns (SAX). The LC separation was performed with an octadecylated silica column at a flow-rate of 0.2 mL\/min, using a mobile phase consisting of water and acetonitrile. MS\/MS was used in multiple reaction monitoring, employing electrospray ionization (ESI-MRM). Recoveries of spiked FB1 and FB2 from beer were 64% and 52%, respectively, at the level of 5 microg\/kg. Recoveries of spiked FB1 and FB2 from malt, cornstarch, and corn grit, at the level of 50 microg\/kg, were 87.9% and 86.4%, 89.5% and 87.9%, 86.6% and 81.1%, respectively. This method may have applications in quality assurance.","858":"Recently Fujikawa et al. [J. Food Hyg. Soc. Japan, 44, 155-160 (2003)] developed a new logistic model for bacterial growth. In the present study, an adjustment factor in the model was improved. The improved model could successfully describe growth curves of Escherichia coli and Salmonella in liquid media. In particular, the model could describe the linear growth at the early logarithmic phase more accurately than the previous model, being similar in this respect to the Baranyi model. However, the improved model more accurately predicted the rate constant of growth and the duration of the lag time as compared with the Baranyi model. These results showed that the improved model has the potential to successfully predict microbial growth.","859":"A sensitive and selective method for quantification and confirmation of patulin in apple juice by GC\/MS was developed. By this method, patulin was precisely determined and confirmed down to the level of 1 and 5 microg\/kg in samples, respectively. Patulin was extracted with ethyl acetate from a sample and then hexane was added to the concentrated extract solution. Significant amounts of insoluble impurities were filtered off, followed by further clean-up by solid-phase extraction with combined silica gel and Florisil cartridges. The filtration step in a low-polarity condition was very effective to remove the impurities in the sample extract solution. The eluate from the cartridges was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and patulin was determined and confirmed by GC\/MS after derivatization with 2.5% N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide ethyl acetate solution. Patulin was determined in the selected ion monitoring mode (m\/z 226) and confirmed in the SCAN mode (m\/z 40-340). The recovery from apple juice spiked with 10-500 microg\/kg ranged from 93.4 to 100%. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.1 (S\/N = 3) and 1 microg\/kg (S\/N = 30) of patulin in samples, respectively. Levels down to 5 microg\/kg of patulin in sample were readily confirmed.","860":"A simple method was developed for the simultaneous determination of seven quinolones (enoxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, lomefloxacin, enrofloxacin and sarafloxacin) in foods using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS\/MS). The seven quinolones were extracted with acetonitrile containing 0.2% formic acid, and the extracted solution was cleaned up on a C18 cartridge. The extract was diluted with 5 mmol\/L IPCC-MS3 for injection into the LC-ESI-MS\/MS. The LC separation was carried out on an ODS column with gradient elution of 5 mmol\/L IPCC-MS3-acetonitrile as the mobile phase. Mass spectral acquisition was done in the positive ion mode by applying selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The recoveries of the seven quinolones were mostly greater than 60% from foods fortified at 10 ng\/g. The detection limits in foods were 2 ng\/g for enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and 1 ng\/g for the other drugs. Twenty cattle muscle, 7 swine muscle, 9 chicken muscle, 16 milk, 19 prawn and 20 broiled eel samples from retail markets were analyzed by this method. Enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin were detected in 9 broiled eel at the level of trace (tr)-34 ng\/g and tr-10 ng\/g, respectively.","861":"We have reported that the administration of bisphenol A to rats reduces the conversion ratio of tryptophan to nicotinamide. In the present paper, we show that bisphenol A, a monomer of polycarbonate plastics, inhibits the enzyme activity of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase. Namely, the conversion ratio of tryptophan to nicotinamide is reduced through the inhibition of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase activity by bisphenol A.","862":"To survey the hygienic quality and freshness of fresh fish and shellfish, 533 specimens of fish and shellfish were collected from fishing piers, traditional markets and supermarkets (including warehouses) in northern Taiwan during the winter (January-February) and summer (July-August) seasons for hygienic quality and freshness examinations. The indicators included total bacterial count, fecal coliform, Escherichia coli, volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) and K value judged from ATP-related compounds. It was found that the hygienic quality and freshness of fish and shellfish decreased in summer, especially for clam and mussel. The ratio of unacceptable hygienic quality or freshness of fish and shellfish was the highest in fecal coliform, followed by E. coli and others. The fecal coliform count in products from the traditional markets was the highest, followed by those from supermarkets and fishing piers. Secondary contamination seems to be the most important problem for hygienic quality and freshness of fish and shellfish.","863":"","864":"","865":"","866":"","867":"","868":"A multiresidue method that enables determination of many pesticides in agricultural products by GC-ECD was studied. First, 63 pesticides were selected as agrochemicals commonly used in crop protection in this country, and\/or found in agricultural products over the past 6 years (April 1996-March 2002) in Aichi Prefecture. A sample was extracted with acetonitrile and the acetonitrile layer was separated by salting-out. The extract was purified on a GPC system with a graphitized carbon columns, and then by a Florisil mini-column fractionation. The test solution was subjected to one-injection, dual-column GC with dual ECD (column: Stx-CLPesticides and Stx-CLPesticides2). The detection limits of the pesticides were in a suitable range (0.0001-0.01 microg\/g) for monitoring pesticide residues in agricultural products. The method was applied to 203 commercial agricultural products to demonstrate its suitability for routine analysis.","869":"A rapid and simple DNA extraction method is needed to detect genetically modified recombinant DNA in soybean kernels and processed foods. However, since various kernels and processed foods differ greatly in form, a uniform DNA extraction method has proved elusive. The silica-base resin DNA extraction method does not use any organic solvent, and the operation is simple and the cost per extraction is low, although the frequency of its use is very low and few domestic reports exist. We therefore studied suitable conditions for a silica-base resin method. We also developed the method to get more pure DNA from soybean kernels. The silica-base resin method was found to be adequate for extracting DNA from various processed foods for PCR amplification with endogenous gene primers. In the case of DNA extraction from soybean kernels, pure DNA could be efficiently extracted after pre-heating the soybean suspension in TNE buffer. The extracted DNA showed higher ratios of absorption at 260 nm\/280 nm and 260 nm\/230 nm than those for samples obtained with previous methods. Moreover, our observations suggested that the extraction time could be reduced to within 30 min for processed foods such as tofu.","870":"A survey concerning foods for which complaints of fungal contamination had been made was carried out by distributing and retrieving a questionnaire. The subject of the survey was foods that were examined for fungi by institutes and laboratories belonging to regulatory agencies following consumers' complaints or upon request from food companies to solve problems. We analyzed 1,096 cases recovered from 40 organizations located in 30 prefectures. Most foods with fungal contamination were \"cake and snacks\", \"beverages\" and \"bakery products\", and processed and cooked foods and beverages accounted for more than 90% of the complaints. The numbers of cases were greater in the summer and less in the winter. The major fungal genus detected in the suspect foods were Penicillium, Aspergillus and Cladosporium. Aspergillus niger was the dominant species contaminating bakery products. Complainers reported physical symptoms including diarrhea, stomach ache, nausea and vomiting in 18% of the cases in which they had eaten or drunk fungus-contaminated foods or beverages. There was no clear difference in the fungi detected between foods and beverages that caused symptoms and those that did not. The proportion of beverages was greater in the foods that induced symptoms than in the whole of the foods for which complaints were made. This was presumed to be because consumers drank fungus-contaminated beverages more often than they ate fungus-contaminated foods.","871":"A simple and rapid method was developed for the analysis of mepiquat chloride in grape, wine and juice by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS). Mepiquat chloride was extracted with water-methanol (1:1). Extracted solution was adjusted to pH 10 with ammonia solution. A part of the extracted solution was cleaned up on a styrenedivinylbenzene (SDVB) cartridge for LC\/MS\/MS. The LC separation was performed on a C18 column (50 mm x 2 mm i.d.) using 0.1% IPCC-MS7-methanol (60:40) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL\/min. The mass spectral acquisition was done in the positive ion mode by applying selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The recoveries of mepiquat chloride from fresh grape, wine and juice fortified at 5 microg\/kg and 50 microg\/kg were 84.5-96.1%. The lower limit of quantification was 1 microg\/kg. Fourteen fresh grape samples, 14 wines (white), 36 wines (red) and 11 juice samples were analyzed by this method. Mepiquat chloride was detected in 5 fresh grape samples, 3 wines (white) and 1 wine (red) at the level of 12.8-199 microg\/kg, 5.7-47.7 microg\/kg and 24.1 microg\/kg, respectively.","872":"A microbiological method for screening of residual benzylpenicillin (PCG), oxytetracycline (OTC) and spiramycin (SPM) in meat using a single mixed mode, reversed-phase and cation-exchange cartridge was developed. A meat sample was extracted with 0.1 mol\/mL pH 4.5 phosphate buffer and the extract was applied to a MCX cartridge. The cartridge was washed, and adsorbed antibiotic residues were eluted with acetonitrile for acidic fractions and acetonitrile containing 5% ammonia solution-0.1 mol\/mL pH 4.5 phosphate buffer (9:1, v\/v) for basic fractions. Each eluate was evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in phosphate buffer to prepare test solutions for microbiological assay. When the diameter of the inhibition zone was more than 12 mm, the result was considered positive. In this method, the average recoveries of PCG at 0.05 microg\/g, OTC at 0.1 microg\/g and SPM at 0.2 microg\/g were 70%, 92% and 84%, respectively. Tolerances of the three antibiotics were detected. All the results demonstrate that this method is simple, rapid and useful for screening of these three antibiotic residues in meat.","873":"Genetially modified organisms (GMOs) were explored in food samples obtained from November 2000 to March 2003 in the Tokyo area by using PCR and real-time PCR techniques. The existence of Roundup Ready Soybean (RRS) was surveyed in processed foods derived from soybeans, such as tofu, boiled soybean, kinako, nama-age, abura-age, natto, miso, soymilk and yuba. RRS was detected in 3 of 37 tofu, 2 of 3 nama-age, 2 of 3 yuba and 3 of 3 abura-age samples. The CBH351 in 70 processed corn foods, NewLeaf Plus and NewLeaf Y in 50 processed potato foods, and 55-1 papaya in 16 papayas were surveyed. These GMOs were not detected among the samples. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of RRS and genetically modified (GM) corn were performed in soybean, corn and semi-processed corn products such as corn meal, corn flour and corn grits. RRS was detected in 42 of 178 soybean samples, and the amount of RRS in RRS-positive samples was determined. The content was in the range of 0.1-1.4% in identity-preserved soybeans (non-GMO), and 49.8-78.8% in non-segregated soybeans. On the other hand, GM corns were detected in 8 of 26 samples. The amount of GM corn in GM corn-positive samples was in the range of 0.1-2.0%.","874":"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used worldwide as additive flame retardants in polymeric materials. Commercial products consist predominantly of deca-, octa-, and pentabromodiphenyl ether mixtures. PBDEs are resistant to degradation in the natural environment and Penta-BDE in particular accumulates in the fatty tissues of fish, birds and mammals (including humans). Several toxic effects on the thyroid system or on neurodevelopment have been reported in experimental animals exposed to PBDEs. It is likely that human exposure is predominantly through the ingestion of contaminated food and\/or mother's milk. The potential health effects of dietary exposure to PBDEs have now become a great concern because of the increasing PBDE levels in the biosphere. In this review, published information on the toxicology of PBDEs, levels in foodstuffs and human milk, and analytical methods has been compiled.","875":"A collaborative study involving 8 laboratories was conducted to evaluate a method for the simultaneous determination of pesticide residues in 6 types of fruits and vegetables (spinach, tomato, apple, radish, cabbage and carrot). The method of analysis was the same as reported by Kakimoto et al. in 2003. One hundred and thirty-nine pesticides were spiked by each of 8 laboratories at levels of 0.1 microg\/g (pesticides analyzed by GC\/MS) or 0.5 microg\/g (pesticides analyzed by HPLC) into the 6 kinds of samples. Statistical analysis showed that 111 pesticides could be analyzed with practical precision by this method. For screening purposes, the method could analyze 118 pesticides. The median values of the limits of detection were 0.001-0.041 microg\/g. The calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.5-5 microg\/mL for most pesticides with median correlation coefficients of 0.983-1.000.","876":"Residues of 14 kinds of beta-lactam and macrolide antibiotics in bovine muscles were extracted with acetonitrile and the extract was partitioned with n-hexane to remove fat. High-performance liquid chromatography was carried out on a TSK-gel ODS-80TM column using gradient elution with acetonitrile-0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and the drugs were quantitated by diode array detection. The recoveries of the drugs from bovine muscles spiked at 0.1 ppm were over 63% and each quantitation limit was 0.04 ppm.","877":"Evaluation of commercial ELISA kits for the screening of deoxynivalenol (DON) was carried out. Three kinds of commercial kits supplied by different companies were used. Three lots of naturally contaminated wheat and DON-free wheat (&lt;0.05 microg\/g) were used as samples. The values obtained from ELISA were compared with those of the HPLC-UV method. In the results obtained from 14 institutions using ELISA, the CV values were less than 17.6% for all the commercial kits. The DON-free sample was not detected as positive with any commercial kits. Also there was no negative finding among the naturally contaminated samples used in this experiment. Coefficients of determination in ELISA and HPLC analysis were 0.979-0.999. These results indicate that ELISA using any of the three commercial kits is efficient for the screening of DON in wheat.","878":"A method for the determination of 12 synthetic food dyes (Amaranth, Erythrosine, Allura Red AC, New Coccine, Phloxine, Rose Bengal, Acid Red, Tartrazine, Sunset Yellow FCF, Fast Green FCF, Brilliant Blue FCF, Indigo Carmine) in food was developed using capillary electrophoresis (CE) with photodiode array detection. The dyes were extracted with water and 0.5% ammonia-ethanol (1:1) mixture, and cleaned up using solid-phase extraction (Sep-Pak Plus tC18). The dyes were eluted with methanol from the cartridge. The dyes were separated by CE on a bubble cell fused-silica capillary (72 cm to the detector, 75 microm i.d.) using 20% acetonitrile in a mixture of 10 mmol\/L potassium phosphate, monobasic and 5 mmol\/L sodium carbonate (pH 10.0) as the running buffer. Identifications of the dyes were performed on the basis of the migration time and the absorbance spectrum of each peak. The coefficients of variation of the migration times and the peak areas were 0.28-0.62% and 1.84-4.30%, respectively (n = 5). The identification limits using the absorbance spectra of the dyes were 10 microg\/mL for Brilliant Blue FCF and Fast Green FCF, and 5 microg\/mL for the other 10 dyes. The recoveries of the 12 dyes from pickles, soft drinks and candies at the level of 10 microg\/g were 70.0-101.5%. The method was applied to the analysis of dyes in foods. The dyes detected by CE were in agreement with those detected by paper chromatography.","879":"During 1990 to 2003, the toxicity of the liver in 4,515 specimens of the puffer fish Takifugu rubripes (torafugu) cultured in netcages or on land were investigated by means of mouse bioassay and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\/MS). Other tissues (skin, muscles, gonads, etc.) were also investigated in some of them. All the livers and other parts examined were found to be non-toxic. The peak corresponding to tetrodotoxin (TTX) was not detected in the samples by LC\/MS analysis for TTX (&lt; 0.1 MU\/g). These results show that puffer fish fed on a non-toxic diet in netcages do not become intoxicated.","880":"Spectrophotometrically determined substances in Yucca extract, listed as \"Yucca foam extract\" in the \"List of Existing Food Additives in Japan\", were investigated by GC\/MS, TLC and GC. A TLC method using an anisaldehyde color developing reagent similar to that employed in spectrophotometry was established for selective detection of sapogenins in Yucca extract. Several steroidal sapogenins were found by GC\/MS in the fractions corresponding to spots on the TLC plate, and these were assumed to have contributed to the color development in spectrophotometry. Sarsasapogenin and smilagenin were the dominant sapogenins. An on-column injection GC method to determine these sapogenins in Yucca extract was also developed. The sum of these two sapogenins in Yucca extract was 0.9%. The total amount of sapogenin estimated by GC was approximately 2%, which was similar to that measured by spectrophotometry.","881":"A sensitive and selective method using liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) for the determination of carbadox metabolites, quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QCA) and desoxycarbadox (Desoxy-CDX), in swine muscle and liver has been developed. The LC separation was performed on a Cadenza CD-C18 column (10 cm x 2 mm i.d.) with a gradient system of 0.01% acetic acid-acetonitrile as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL\/min. Negative ionization produced the [M-H]- molecular ion of QCA. On the other hand, the positive mode produced the [M+H]+ ion of Desoxy-CDX. The calibration graphs for QCA and Desoxy-CDX were rectilinear from 0.01 to 0.5 ng with selected ion monitoring (SIM). The drugs were extracted with 0.3% metaphosphoric acid-methanol (7:3), and the extracts were cleaned up on an Oasis HLB cartridge (60 mg) and by liquid-liquid extraction. The recoveries of QCA and Desoxy-CDX from swine muscle and liver fortified at 2.5 and 5 ng\/g were 70.2-86.3%, and the detection limits were 1 ng\/g for both drugs.","882":"Extracts of sausage, sauce, pasta sauce, fish paste and cereal spiked with wheat standard protein at a level of 5-20 ng\/mL as sample solutions were analyzed in replicate in 10 laboratories. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of both ELISA methods using a Wheat Protein ELISA Kit (Gliadin kit) and a FASTKIT Wheat ELISA Kit (Wheat ELISA kit) were mostly below 10%. Mean recoveries of the wheat standard protein from the food extracts were over 40% in the two ELISA methods except those from cereal extract determined using the Wheat ELISA kit. Repeatability relative standard deviations of wheat standard protein in the five food extracts were in the ranges of 16-26.9% and 3.7-36.2% for the Gliadin kit and the Wheat ELISA kit, respectively. Reproducibility relative standard deviations of wheat standard protein in the five food extracts were 21.6-38.5%, 29.7-53.8% for the Gliadin kit and the Wheat ELISA kit, respectively. The recoveries of wheat standard protein from the cereal extract were improved by the increasing the amount of antibody coated on the plate in the Wheat ELISA kit. The detection limits of both ELISA methods were 1 ng\/mL in sample solutions. These results suggested that the notified ELISA methods are reliable and reproducible for the inspection of wheat protein levels in extracts of sausage, sauce, pasta sauce, fish paste and cereal.","883":"Extracts of sausage, sauce, cookie, cereal and pasta sauce spiked with milk standard protein at a level of 5-20 ng\/mL as sample solutions were analyzed in replicate in 10 laboratories. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of the three ELISA methods using a Milk Protein Casein ELISA Kit (Casein kit), a Milk Protein Beta-Lactoglobulin ELISA Kit (Beta-Lactoglobulin kit) and a FASTKIT Milk ELISA Kit (Milk ELISA kit) were mostly below 10%. Mean recoveries of the milk standard protein from the food extracts were over 40% in the three ELISA methods with a few excertions. The recoveries of milk standard protein from the sauce extract in Casein kit were improved by adjusting the extract to neutrality before the Casein kit assay. The recoveries of milk standard protein from cookie, cereal and pasta sauce were improved by the increasing the amount of antibody coated in the Milk ELISA kit. The detection limits of all the ELISA methods were 1 ng\/mL in sample solutions. These results suggested that the notified ELISA methods are reliable and reproducible for the inspection of milk protein levels in extracts of sausage, sauce, cookie, cereal and pasta sauce.","884":"An enrichment procedure and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the detection of injured Escherichia coli O157 in foods were examined. Freeze-injured E. coli O157 inoculated in boiled spaghetti could be detected in 6-h culture within 12 h by the PCR method. Cells injured by heating in boiled spaghetti and cells injured by chlorine treatment in raw lettuce and carrot did not grow sufficiently to be detected in 6-h culture but were detected in 18-h culture using selective agar media. The injured cells could be also detected in 18-h culture within 24 h by the PCR method. Enrichment at 42 degrees C in trypticase soy broth (TSB) was more effective than that at 42 degrees C in modified EC broth with novobiocin. These results indicated that the usage of enrichment in TSB for 18 h at 42 degrees C in combination with the PCR method is suitable for screening for E. coli O157 in boiled or chlorinated foods, even if the O157 cells are injured.","885":"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against lasalocid and semduramicin were prepared using keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates for the immunization of mice. With these MAbs, we developed quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods for lasalocid and semduramicin. The ELISAs were quantitative in the ranges of 0.1-50 ng\/mL for lasalocid and 0.05-12.5 ng\/mL for semduramicin, and showed 50% inhibition concentrations of 1.2 ng\/mL for lasalocid and 0.5 ng\/mL for semduramicin. The coefficient of variations (CV%) of lasalocid were 0.3-4.4% for intra-assay and 0.5-5.1% for inter-assay and those of semduramicin were 0.1-4.6% for intra-assay and 0.3-5.2% for inter-assay. The detection limits for lasalocid and semduramicin were 10 ng\/g and 5 ng\/g in chicken liver and muscle, respectively. Based on the immunochromatographic method, rapid test kits for lasalocid and semduramicin were also developed. With these kits, the detection limits of lasalocid were 50 ng\/mL for standard solution and 125 ng\/g for chicken muscle, and those of semduramicin were 10 ng\/mL for standard solution and 100 ng\/g for chicken muscle.","886":"The effects of foods and chemicals related to food hygiene on degranulation were evaluated using a method for assaying the enzyme activity of beta-hexosaminidase as an index of chemical mediator release from RBL-2H3 cells in vitro. Using a previously developed assay system, we had found a large number of inhibitors and promoters of degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells. In the present study, we examined the inhibitory effect of zinc chloride on the degranulation (beta-hexosaminidase release) from RBL-2H3 cells with or without antigen in the presence of the degranulation-promotive chemicals, namely, 4 food additives, 7 pesticides and 2 veterinary drugs. These promotive chemicals were classified into two types on the basis of inhibitory profile by zinc chloride: 1) those which showed marked degranulation-inhibitory action when the cells were stimulated with antigen, such as butylhydroxyanisole, dibutylhydroxytoluene, EPN, cis- and trans-permethrin, prothiofos, pyridaben, terbufos, 2) those which showed marked degranulation-inhibitory action whether the cells were stimulated with antigen or not, such as butyl p-hydroxybenzoate, o-phenylphenol, bitertanol, salinomycin. In conclusion, zinc had a dramatic inhibitory effect on enhanced degranulation induced by synthetic chemicals in vitro.","887":"Ion-trap LC\/MS\/MS was evaluated for use in the determination of acrylamide (AA) in processed foods. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis of a series of AA standard solutions containing deuterium-labeled acrylamide (AA-d3) as an internal standard was performed. A linear relationship between the concentration of AA and the ratio of peak area (AA\/AA-d3) in the extracted ion chromatogram (m\/z 55, 58 derived from m\/z 72, 75, respectively) was obtained over a wide range of 2-20,000 ng\/mL. The quantification limit of AA was 2 ng\/mL. In analyses of 37 commercial foods, AA was detected in a potato snack at the maximum value of 3,570 ng\/g and found in 23 foods prepared or cooked at high temperature. The samples were analyzed in triplicate and the relative standard deviations (RSD) were less than 15% in many processed foods.","888":"We investigated 160 kinds of pesticide residues in 715 samples of 116 kinds of foods distributed in Kitakyushu city. Sixty kinds of pesticides were detected in 55 kinds of foods (204 samples) in the range of 0.002-22 mg\/kg. Five kinds of pesticides in 7 samples violated the residue standards and the indication of \"unused\". The detection ratios of unregulated pesticide in domestic and imported foods were 27.8 and 33.0%, respectively. Iprodione, dicofol, diethofencarb, procymidone and chlorfenapyr (for domestic food) and total bromine, benomyl, chlorpyrifos, dicofol, fenvalerate, cypermethrin and dimethoate (for imported food) showed relatively high detection ratios. Chinese cabbage, garland chrysanthemum, tomatoes and green teas (domestic) and broccoli, bananas, grapefruit, lemons, oranges, frozen edamame and frozen kidney beans (imported) showed high relative pesticide detection ratios. Residual pesticides were detected with relatively high frequency in imported fruits, imported frozen foods and imported processed foods.","889":"A method for the simultaneous determination of stevioside (Stev), rebaudioside A (RebA) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA) in foods was developed. These sweeteners were extracted from foods, except for dried fishes and shellfishes, by dialysis against Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0). Dried fishes and shellfishes were extracted with Tris-HCl buffer--methanol (2:8). The extracts were cleaned up with an Oasis MAX cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 0.05 mol\/L sodium acetate (pH 4.0)--methanol (19:1), and the three sweeteners were eluted with 0.1 mol\/L phosphoric acid--acetonitrile (1:1). Stev, RebA and GA in the eluate were chromatographed on a Develosil RPAQUEOUS-AR-5 (4.6 mm i.d. x 250 mm) column with 0.02 mol\/L phosphoric acid-acetonitrile--methanol (90:55:5) as a mobile phase and monitored at 210 nm for Stev and RebA, and at 254 nm for GA. The recoveries of Stev, RebA and GA from 8 kinds of foods spiked at the level of 0.1 g\/kg were 81.7-101%, 81.5-100% and 78.6-95.0%, respectively. The determination limits were 0.01 g\/kg in samples.","890":"This study was designed to clarify the mechanism of the decrease of tetrodotoxin (TTX) toxicity during storage in a modified seawater medium (MSWM). When TTX was added to sterilized MSWM, the toxicity of TTX in the medium markedly decreased within 1 day, as determined by a mouse bioassay. HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) analysis showed that the peak of TTX was reduced and new unidentified peaks were observed. Omission of the P-1 metal solution from MSWM suppressed the decrease in TTX toxicity and the disappearance of TTX. Further studies indicated that boric acid in the P-1 metal solution triggers this toxicity decrease, indicating that TTX is chemically, not microbiologically, converted to unknown compounds in MSWM.","891":"Non-toxic cultured juvenile kusafugu were fed with diet containing crystalline tetrodotoxin (TTX) for 30 days and then fed with non-toxic diet for 170 days. During this period, 5 fish were sampled and the toxicity of each tissue was determined periodically. The amount of total accumulated toxin in the fish was 90 microg, representing 50% of the administered TTX (180 microg\/fish) at the 60th day. It decreased to 54 microg (30%) at the 80th day and then remained unchanged up to the 200th day. The amount of toxin in the liver amounted to 40 microg (45% of total accumulated toxin) at the 30th day and gradually decreased to 5 microg (10%) at the 200th day. The toxin amount in the skin reached the highest level with 30 microg (30%) at the 50th day and then remained unchanged during the experimental period. The testes had almost no toxicity. Although the ovaries were immature, the toxin amounts increased as the weight of the tissues increased. With administration of crystalline TTX, all kusafugu used in the experiment became toxic and retained the toxin at the level of 30% of the administered toxin for about 5 months thereafter, while being fed with non-toxic diet.","892":"We have developed an analytical method for terpene resins in chewing gum. The fraction including terpene resins was prepared by means of hexane extraction and two silica gel column chromatography treatments (hexane and ethyl acetate) from chewing gum. The terpene resin fraction was analyzed with LC\/MS and IR. The terpene resins are mixtures of polymeric pinene and\/or limonene, which have a monomer molecular weight of 136. The MS spectrum of the terpene resin peak on the LC\/MS total ion chromatogram showed protonated molecular ion (M + H)+ peaks at intervals of m\/z 136, characteristic of a complex mixture of polyterpenes. IR spectroscopy is a suitable technique to identify the terpene resin type, ie., pinene or limonene. When the method was applied to imported chewing gum sold in Japan, terpene resins were clearly detected.","893":"In 1998, a typhoon struck before rice harvesting in Japan, and the unpolished rice was found to be stained brown. Samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of trichothecenes using GC\/MS. The mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON), fusarenon-X (Fus.-X) and nivalenol (NIV) were detected and confirmed with GC\/MS. The quantity of trichothecenes was determined using GC-ECD. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of the trichothecene Fus.-X in rice.","894":"","895":"We evaluated simultaneous analytical methods for organophosphorus pesticides in cruciferous vegetables by gas chromatography (GC). Firstly, 36 pesticides were selected on the basis of monitoring data (April 1996-March 2003) in Aichi Prefecture. A sample was extracted with acetonitrile and the acetonitrile layer was separated by salting-out. The extract was cleaned up with gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and then with a tandem silica-gel\/PSA mini-column. The test solution was subjected to dual-column GC equipped with a pulsed FPD (P mode, Rtx-OPPesticides column) and a FTD (Rtx-OPPesticides 2 column). Organophosphorus pesticides in such sulfur-rich matrices as cabbage and radish were determined without any serious interfering peaks on the pulsed FPD chromatograms after diluting the extracts 10- to 20-fold (0.25-0.5 mg\/L of sample). The method was applied to cruciferous vegetables to demonstrate its usefulness in routine analysis.","896":"Natural sex hormones, estradiol-17 beta (EST), progesterone (PRO) and testosterone (TES), in sixty domestic bovine muscles and forty bovine muscles imported from USA and Australia were determined by radioimmunoassay. The EST, PRO and TES levels (mean +\/- standard deviation) in domestic samples (n = 60) was 1.15 +\/- 1.87 ppt, 3.19 +\/- 5.80 ppb and 30.9 +\/- 122.1 ppt on a whole basis, respectively. The hormone levels in muscles was presumed to reflect sex, estrous cycle, and so on. The hormone levels in imported bovine muscles (n = 40) were 3.33 +\/- 2.83 ppt (EST), 0.52 +\/- 0.50 ppb (PRO) and 8.8 +\/- 13.0 ppt (TES), respectively.","897":"Some model studies were performed using various agricultural Products, to clarify the relation between cooking conditions and production of acrylamide (AA). Disc chips made from dried mashed potato, corn meal, wheat flour, rice flour (jyohshin-ko) and glutinous rice flour (shiratama-ko), and dried sesame (arai-goma) and dried almond were baked at 120-200 degrees C for 5-20 min, and the samples were analyzed for the levels of AA. When the samples were baked for 10 min, the highest production of AA was observed at 180-200 degrees C. When the samples were baked at 180 degrees C, AA levels in agricultural products except sesame were highest after baking for 10 min. Vegetables and fruit were baked at 220 degrees C for 5 min with a oven, high AA concentrations were found in baked potato, asparagus, pumpkin, eggplant and green gram sprouts. Concentrations of AA in potato, asparagus and green gram sprouts baked after being pre-cooked by microwave irradiation were higher than those in the products baked without being precooked. On the other hand, the precooking by boiling reduced the production of AA by baking to 1\/10-1\/4. Acrylamide was not found in microwaved or boiled vegetables. High free asparagine concentrations in crops tended to result in high concentrations of AA being produced by heating the agricultural products.","898":"A rapid analytical method for residues of the herbicide, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine], glufosinate [DL-homoalanine-4-yl(methyl)phosphinic acid] and glufosinate metabolite (MPPA: 3-methylphosphinicopropionic acid) in vegetables and fruits was developed by improving the bulletin method of glufosinate. 50 mL of solution extracted with water (corresponding to 2 g of the sample) was loaded on a column packed with 5 mL of anion exchange resin and then the trapped glyphosate, glufosinate and MPPA were eluted with 60 mL of 50% acetic acid. After derivatization with trimethyl orthoacetate, the derivatives were purified and separated on a Florisil cartridge column. The determination of the derivatives was performed with GC-FPD. The detection limits for glyphosate, glufosinate and MPPA were 0.01 microgram\/g, 0.01 microgram\/g and 0.005 microgram\/g, respectively. The recoveries from fortified samples were 83.5-89.8% for glyphosate, 77.9-92.2% for glufosinate and 75.0-87.2% for MPPA.","899":"The growth responses of Vibrio parahamolyticus to pH, NaCl concentration and temperature changes were studied using serotype O3:K6 and other strains. Growth curves were obtained for 27 different sets of conditions, comprised of three levels of NaCl concentration, pH and temperature. The temperature, pH and NaCl concentrations most favorable for growth were in the order of 25 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 15 degrees C, pH 8, 7 and 5.8, and 1%, 3% and 7%, respectively. The bacteria grew most rapidly at 25 degrees C, at a pH of 7 or 8 in the presence of 1% or 3% NaCl, with the population (initial, ca. 2.5 log CFU\/mL) reaching a level log 7 CFU\/mL at 12 h. A growth predictive model using the Gompertz equation was generated from the experimental data for any combination of NaCl concentration, pH and temperature within the range used in this study.","900":"The effect of coexisting metals in a sample on the determination of lead and cadmium in plastics used for food contact materials was investigated. In the official method specified in the Japanese Food Sanitation Law, contents of lead and cadmium are determined by a dry incineration method using sulfuric acid. It was assumed that sometimes, coexisting metals in a sample may form insoluble sulfate and that lead sulfate might be adsorbed into the insoluble sulfate. Therefore, hydrochloric acid was added to the ash, to turn formed insoluble sulfate into soluble compounds (HCl addition method). We found that recoveries of cadmium were not affected in the presence of other metals except when calcium exceeded 20 mg\/g in both methods. Recoveries of lead decreased in the presence of barium exceeding 0.1 mg\/g or calcium exceeding 10 mg\/g in the official method. However, improvement of recoveries was achieved with the HCl addition method and by reducing the sample amount to one-tenth (0.1 g) of that specified in the official method.","901":"To simplify the labor-intensive conventional routine testing of samples to detect Leuconostoc at a meat processing plant, we developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers specific for Leuconostoc from 16S rRNA gene sequences. These primers did not detect other common lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. sake, Lact. fermentum, Lact. acidophilus and Weissella viridescens. PCR with this primer detected all Leuconostoc species tested (Leu. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leu. pseudomesenteroides, Leu. carnosum, Leu. lactic, Leu. citreum, Leu. amelibiosum, Leu. gelidum), except for Leu. fallax, and no other lactic acid bacteria on agarose gel electrophoresis. The method could identify areas contaminated with Leuconostoc in a large-scale industrial meat processing plant. Of 69 samples analyzed, 34 were positive for Leuconostoc according to the conventional culture method (isolation of LAB producing dextran) and PCR, whereas 29 were negative according to both. Six samples were culture-negative but positive by PCR. No false negative results were generated by PCR. The method is rapid and simple, is useful for routinely monitoring areas contaminated with Leuconostoc in meat processing plants, and could help to prevent the spoilage of meat products.","902":"A histochemical assay for detecting genetically modified (GM) papaya (derived from Line 55-1) is described. GM papaya, currently undergoing a safety assessment in Japan, was developed using a construct that included a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene linked to a virus coat protein (CP) gene. Histochemical assay was used to visualize the blue GUS reaction product from transgenic seed embryos. Twelve embryos per fruit were extracted from the papaya seeds using a surgical knife. The embryos were incubated with the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronide (X-Gluc) in a 96-well microtiter plate for 10-15 hours at 37 degrees C. Seventy-five percent of GM papaya embryos should turn blue theoretically. The histochemical assay results were completely consistent with those from a qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method developed by this laboratory. Furthermore, the method was validated in a five-laboratory study. The method for detection of GM papaya is rapid and simple, and does not require use of specialized equipment.","903":"A 52-week study of oral-repeated-dose toxicity for the extraction powder of Gymnema sylvestre (GS), Indian-native genus, Metaplexis japonica, was conducted in both genders of Wistar rats. The rats were administered a graded dose of GS at 0.01, 0.10 and 1.00% of basal powder diet, along with a group fed solely with the basal powder diet without GS, for 52 weeks. General conditions were recorded daily. Body weights and food consumptions were recorded weekly up to 12 weeks, and thereafter at longer intervals. At 26 weeks, for an intermediate examination, and 52 weeks, for the final examination, animals were subjected to hematology, serum chemistry, and pathological examination. None of the animals died in the period up to 52 weeks. No exposure-related changes in body-weight, in the food consumption, in the hematological examinations, or in the serum biochemical examinations were recognized. No histopathological alterations were seen. Thus, it was concluded that there was no toxic effect in rats treated with GS at up to 1.00% in the diet for 52 weeks. The no-observable-effect level from this study is 1.00% GS, i.e., 504 mg\/kg\/day for male and 563 mg\/kg\/day for female as mean daily intake, for 52 weeks.","904":"Bisphenol A, a monomer of polycarbonate plastics, disturbed the conversion pathway of the amino acid tryptophan to the vitamin nicotinamide. The conversion ratio of tryptophan to nicotinamide was reduced to 1\/15 by feeding a diet containing 1% bisphenol A. A putative disturbing reaction is kynurenine--&gt;3-hydroxykynurenine, which is catalyzed by kynurenine monohydroxylase. This is an FAD-enzyme and requires NADPH as a coenzyme. Styrene monomer (1% addition to a normal diet) did not affect the food intake or the body weight, but slightly reduced the conversion ratio of tryptophan-nicotinamide.","905":"","906":"An improved migration test was developed for determination of trace amounts of epichlorohydrin from internal can coatings. Eight kinds of sample cans, coated mainly with epoxy resin, for foods and beverages were prepared, and both their bodies and lids were tested for migration as follows. A body was filled with n-pentane and soaked for 2 hours at 25 degrees C. A lid was soaked in n-pentane (2 mL\/cm2) for 2 hours at 25 degrees C. The test solution was analyzed by GC-FID and GC\/MS using two DB-WAX capillary columns with different inside diameters. The limits of quantitation were 0.05 microgram\/mL by GC-FID and 0.02 microgram\/mL by GC\/MS with selected ion monitoring. Recoveries of spiked epichlorohydrin were 99.9-104.5% at the level of 0.05 microgram\/mL and 0.5 microgram\/mL, with high precision. In this study, no epichlorohydrin was found to have migrated from any of the bodies and lids.","907":"Jamaica quassia extract, a natural bittering agent, is described as \"a substance extracted from bark of Jamaica quassia (Quassia excelsa Sw.)\" in the List of Existing Food Additives in Japan. The constituents in Jamaica quassia extract product were investigated as a part of an ongoing study to evaluate its quality and safety as a food additive. The main constituents of the extract were identified as quassin and two isomers of neoquassin by using LC\/MS. The main constituent, quassin, was isolated and the structure was determined by spectral means. The quantification of their main constituents was performed by HPLC using quassin as a standard, and the concentrations of quassin and total of neoquassin isomers were 21.4% and 55.5%. In addition, it was confirmed that Jamaica quassia extract was different from quassia extract, which is extracted from bark of Picrasma quassioides Benn. belonging to the same family as Q. excelsa, by comparing their HPLC profiles.","908":"To determine polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCBs) in green leafy vegetables, the cleanup method was modified, and packing methods for a multi-layer silica gel column were compared in food samples. First, the additional cleanup was examined for a mono-ortho PCBs fraction obtained by alumina column chromatography from spinach extract. Small solids such as rough crystals that remained after concentration of the mono-ortho PCBs fraction were identified as long-chain hydrocarbons from leaf epicuticular wax by GC\/MS. Cleanup using an activated carbon silica gel column with n-hexane as the washing solvent was effective. Next, multi-layer silica gel columns packed by wet packing and dry packing were compared using komatsuna, salmon and butter as samples. The columns prepared by both methods gave similar values at each isomeric concentration level and showed similar efficiency with favorable recoveries.","909":"We determined the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCBs) in three types of fast foods [(1) seventeen hamburgers and two hot dogs, (2) six portions of fried potatoes and (3) three chicken products] obtained from fast food shops or convenience stores in Japan. All samples tested showed low toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) levels of dioxins in the range of 0.001-0.083 pg-TEQ\/g wet weight (0.006-0.053 pg-TEQ\/g for hamburgers and hot dogs, 0.001-0.083 pg-TEQ\/g for fried potatoes and 0.053-0.065 pg-TEQ\/g for chicken products). The congener profile in hamburgers and hot dogs suggested that the total TEQ was mainly determined by Co-PCBs, especially by 3,3',4,4',5-PeCB (#126), which accounted for 44% of the total TEQ value. Findings for animal foods such as beef and cheese were consistent with this result. For fried potatoes, PCDD\/Fs accounted for 94% of the total TEQ value, and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF accounted for 32% of PCDD\/Fs. Dioxins in the chicken products consisted of 3,3',4,4',5-PeCB (#126) and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, which accounted for 23% and 21% of the total TEQ, respectively. If an adult (50 kg weight) eats 150 g of hamburger, 100 g of potatoes and 150 g of chicken, the daily intake is estimated to be 0.299 pg-TEQ\/kg b.w.\/day using the average values (0.022, 0.028 and 0.059 pg-TEQ\/g, respectively) obtained in this study. This value corresponds to 7.5% of the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for PCDD\/Fs and Co-PCBs in Japan.","910":"The objective of this study was to elucidate the utility of ion-trap GC\/MS\/MS for the analysis of pesticides in extracted matrices from various agricultural products. Identification and quantitative analysis of pesticides in matrices were performed by quadrupole GC\/MS and ion-trap GC\/MS\/MS. Chlorpyrifos was added to the matrix of spinach, soybean in the pod or corn, and aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, gamma-BHC, delta-BHC, p,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDT were added to each matrix of green tea, black tea or oolong tea. Although most of the pesticides in the matrix could not be determined by quadrupole GC\/MS-Scan analysis at 0.1 microgram\/mL, every pesticide was identified from the mass spectrum using ion-trap GC\/MS\/MS at the same concentration. The quantitation limit of every pesticide in each matrix by ion-trap GC\/MS\/MS analysis was higher than that by GC\/MS-SIM analysis. The calibration curves obtained by GC\/MS\/MS were linear in the range of 0.01-0.25 microgram\/mL of each pesticide. The recoveries of each pesticide from four kinds of samples spiked at the levels of 0.01 ppm to 0.02 ppm in extracts were 61.2-138.3% with SD values in the range from 1.2 to 15.4%. This study revealed that ion-trap GC\/MS\/MS was useful for the identification and quantitative analysis of low-level pesticides residues in matrices of agricultural products.","911":"A simple and convenient analytical method for the determination of acrylamide in processed foods was established. Acrylamide was extracted with water in an ultrasonic bath. The extract was passed through an OASIS HLB cartridge and the eluate was injected into the HPLC system using a column-switching technique. The HPLC system consisted of two pumps, two 6-port-2-position valves, two columns and a UV detector. At first, the sample solution was chromatographed on an ODS column with a mobile phase of water, then the flow of the mobile phase was switched using a 6-port-2-position valve, and the acrylamide peak fraction was introduced into an aqueous gel permeation column (analytical column). The fraction was chromatographed again on the analytical column with a mobile phase of water, and the eluate was monitored with a UV detector (205 nm). The recoveries of acrylamide from potato chips, fried potato, croquette and instant noodle fortified at levels of 50 to 1,000 micrograms\/kg were 93.1 to 101.5% and the coefficient of variation was 1.5 to 5.2%. The detection limit corresponded to 10 micrograms\/kg in processed foods. Forty-six samples, potato chips (11), fried potato (10), croquette (20) and instant noodle (5), were analyzed by this method. The acrylamide level was 67-4,499 micrograms\/kg for potato chips, 125-1,183 micrograms\/kg for fried potato, nd-255 micrograms\/kg for croquette and nd-151 micrograms\/kg for instant noodle.","912":"To evaluate dioxin contamination in retail vegetables, congener analyses of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCBs) were performed on sixty varieties of fresh vegetables including cereals and mushrooms, obtained from Japanese supermarkets in 2002. The toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) levels for dioxins in samples ranged from &lt; 0.001 to 0.089 pg-TEQ\/g wet weight, when undetected and trace were taken as zero. Among the samples, dioxins were generally detected in green leafy vegetables. The highest TEQ value was for mulukhiya (0.089 pg-TEQ\/g), followed by spinach and komatsuna (Japanese mustard spinach) (0.077 and 0.074 pg-TEQ\/g, respectively). Additionally, the dioxin levels in seventeen varieties of frozen vegetables were also determined, and showed TEQ values ranging from &lt; 0.001 to 0.080 pg-TEQ\/g. The total TEQ in commercial vegetables mainly reflected the levels of 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and 3,3',4,4',5-PeCB (#126) (the sum of them represented 63% of the total TEQ).","913":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus densities in spiked and naturally contaminated seafood samples were enumerated by the MPN method combined with a PCR procedure (MPN-PCR method) targeting the species-specific thermolabile hemolysin gene (tlh), and by the MPN method using subcultivation of alkaline-peptone-water (APW) enrichment culture on thiosulfate-citrate-bile-sucrose (TCBS) agar (MPN-TCBS method). In the samples spiked with both V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus, the numbers of V. parahaemolyticus enumerated by the MPN-PCR method were similar to, or higher than the numbers of spiked cells, whereas those enumerated by the MPN-TCBS method were below the numbers of spiked cells. In naturally contaminated seafood samples, the numbers of V. parahaemolyticus enumerated by the MPN-PCR method were higher than those by the MPN-TCBS method. In the case of the MPN-TCBS method, isolation of V. parahaemolyticus from some APW cultures was difficult because of the overgrowth of many colonies other than V. parahaemolyticus (e.g., V. alginolyticus) on TCBS agar. In contrast, the PCR technique could detect tlh from APW culture without isolation of V. parahaemolyticus, so the possibility of failing to obtain a positive result in APW culture by the MPN-PCR method was considered to be lower than that by the MPN-TCBS method. Furthermore, utilization of the PCR technique reduces the time and labor required for the biochemical identification tests used in the MPN-TCBS method. For the detection and enumeration of V. parahaemolyticus in seafood, especially for samples that show many colonies other than V. parahaemolyticus on TCBS agar, the MPN-PCR method may be more convenient and reliable than the MPN-TCBS method.","914":"To investigate the key factors affecting the reliability of the analytical results, a laboratory-performance study was attempted for the notified methods to detect genetically modified (GM) maize (CBH351) and GM potato (NewLeaf Plus and NewLeaf Y). The test samples were designed as three pairs of blind duplicates, which included 0%, 0.1% and 1.0% GM maize (CBH351) or GM potato (NewLeaf Plus or NewLeaf Y). Fourteen laboratories participated in the study. The test samples were sent to the participating laboratories along with the protocol. The data were collected from all laboratories and statistically analyzed. For the 0% sample of the CBH351 maize, one laboratory reported a false-positive result. It was considered that contamination could have occurred via the common use of equipment or tools for the test. For the 0.1% samples of the NewLeaf Plus potato or NewLeaf Y potato, on the other hand, three laboratories reported false-negative results. It was presumed that these results were due to changes of the conditions of the electrophoresis and agarose-gel staining. The other laboratories reported appropriate results. It was considered that the method employed in this study was suitable for the assessment of laboratory performance.","915":"","916":"A simultaneous determination method of 7 N-methylcarbamate and 7 urea pesticides in agricultural products by liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) has been developed. Under reversed-phase liquid chromatographic conditions, 14 pesticides were analyzed using electrospray ionization (ESI) with simultaneous acquisition of positive ions and negative ions. Fourteen pesticides were extracted with acetone, 10% NaCl solution was added, and the pesticides were re-extracted with dichloromethane. The extract was concentrated under reduced pressure, and dissolved in methanol. The detection limits of 14 pesticides ranged from 0.0012 to 0.0056 microgram\/g. The recoveries of pesticides were from 36.5 to 112.5% [RSD (n = 3) ranged from 0.5 to 48.1%] for 4 agricultural products.","917":"A method was developed for simultaneous determination of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. Residues were extracted from samples with acetonitrile, followed by a salting-out step and a partitioning step with n-hexane at the same time. Co-extractives were removed with ENVI-Carb\/LC-NH2 mini-column cleanup. Analysis was performed by GC\/MS (SCAN mode) and HPLC. Of the 139 pesticides spiked at 0.1 or 0.5 microgram\/g into 6 fruits and vegetables (spinach, tomato, apple, radish, cabbage and carrot), recoveries of 117 pesticides were between 70 and 120%. This method is appropriate for determining these pesticides and for screening several other pesticides for which the recoveries were &lt; or = 70% or &gt; or = 120% (imazalil, etc.). The limits of detection for most pesticides in this method were equal to or lower than those of the bulletin method in Japan.","918":"A simple and rapid liquid chromatographic method was developed for the simultaneous determination of twelve benzimidazole anthelmintics in livestock foods using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (PDA). A sample was homogenized with acetonitrile and n-hexane, and centrifuged. The acetonitrile phase was isolated and evaporated. The residue was dissolved in 0.1 mol\/L carbonate buffer solution (pH = 9.1), sonicated, and then subjected to clean-up on a Bond Elut LRC-C18 cartridge. The benzimidazole compounds were separated isocratically on a Capcell Pak C18 UG 120 (5 microns, 150 x 4.6 mm i.d.) column and detected by PDA at 295 and 313 nm. Mixtures of acetonitrile and 0.05 mol\/L ammonium acetate in mixing ratios of (20:80) and (40:60) were used as the mobile phase, and the flow-rate was 1.0 mL\/min at 40 degrees C. The mean recoveries (n = 3) from 0.1-0.5 microgram\/g added samples were 72.6-97.2% with coefficients of variation of 0.3-8.5%. The detection limits were 0.01-0.05 microgram\/g.","919":"An experimental proficiency test program for ability to screen 104 residual pesticides in agricultural products has been conducted. Eight Japanese laboratories joined the program. Items tested in the present study were limit of detection, internal proficiency test (self spike) and external proficiency test (blind spike). All 104 pesticides were well detected and recovered from agricultural foods in the internal proficiency test. However, the results of the external proficiency test did not completely agree with those of the internal proficiency tests. After 5 rounds of the blind spike test, the ratio of the number of correctly detected pesticides to that of actually contained ones (49 total) ranged from 65% to 100% among laboratories. The numbers of mistakenly detected pesticides by a laboratory were 0 to 15. Thus, there was a great difference among the laboratories in the ability to screen multiresidual pesticides.","920":"Stabilizers (epoxidized linseed oil and epoxidized soybean oil) and plasticizers (acetyl tributyl citrate, diacetyl monolauryl glyceride and dibutyl sebacate) commonly used in polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) films and extracts of such films were investigated for estrogenic and androgenic activity by means of estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) competitive ligand-binding assays. Further, in in vivo experiments, ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were observed for uterine wet weight change, uterine endometrium hyperplasia and vaginal mucosa cornification, following administration of each test compound or extract orally (0.5 or 500 mg\/kg) or subcutaneously (0.5 or 100 mg\/kg). No significant response or change was observed with any of the test compounds or extracts, either in vitro or in vivo. The results thus indicate that neither the stabilizers and plasticizers used in PVDC films, nor their extracts, exert sex-hormonal activity.","921":"The concentrations of 7 non-volatile amines, tyramine (Tym), histamine (Him), phenethylamine (Phm), putrescine (Put), cadaverine (Cad), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) in the liquid part of \"moromi\" mash during soy sauce fermentation were studied. These amines, except for him and Cad, were detected during fermentation by the conventional production method in the laboratory. Put and Spd were detected at the beginning, and Tym, Phm and Spm appeared later; these 5 amines increased gradually during the fermentation. Put, Spd, Spm and Cad were present in the raw starting material for soy sauce; thus, Tym and Phm were produced by the fermentation. When \"moromi\" mash was added to liquid medium and cultivated, Tym was detected in some \"moromi\" mash and the other amines were not detected. Tym-producing bacterial strains were isolated from the liquid culture media of Tym-positive \"moromi\" mash. The Tym-producing strain was a gram-positive coccus. The conditions for production of amines by Tym-producing bacterial strains were examined. These strains grew and produced tyramine under various conditions, which may occur during soy sauce fermentation. Namely, Tym was produced at pH 5-10, at salt concentrations of less than 8%, under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. During soy sauce fermentation, it is assumed that Tym would be produced by these strains during the early stages of soy sauce aging within a short period when the salt concentration and pH conditions are optimal for growth. Based on the bacteriological properties, the strains were identified as Enterococcus faecium. With the exception of Phm and Him, which did not exist in the starting raw material, non-volatile amines (including Put, Cad, Spd and Spm) were not produced and microorganisms producing them are not believed to be present during \"moromi\" fermentation.","922":"Inter-laboratory evaluation studies were conducted for the notified ELISA methods for allergic substances (Egg). Standard extracts of egg spiked in extracts of sausage, sauce, cookie, bread and cereal at a level of 5-20 ng\/mL as the sample solution were analyzed in replicate in 10 laboratories. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of all three ELISA methods using an Egg Protein ovalbumin ELISA Kit (ovalbumin kit), an Egg Protein ovomucoid ELISA Kit (ovomucoid kit) and a FASTKIT Egg ELISA kit (Egg ELISA kit) were mostly less than 10%. Mean recoveries of the standard extract of egg were over 40% in the three ELISA methods. Repeatability relative standard deviations of egg standard solution in five food extracts were in the ranges of 18.7-25.5%, 18.6-41.8%, 21.3-43.3% for the ovalbumin kit, the ovomucoid kit and the Egg ELISA kit, respectively. Reproducibility relative standard deviations of egg standard solution in five food extracts were 16.8-35.1%, 19.6-35.8%, 24.7-51.1% for the ovalbumin kit, the ovomucoid kit and the Egg ELISA kit, respectively. The detection limits of all the ELISA methods were 4-5 ng\/mL in sample solutions. These results suggested that the notified ELISA methods are reliable and reproducible for the inspection of egg protein levels in extracts of sausage, sauce, cookie, bread and cereal.","923":"","924":"","925":"","926":"","927":"","928":"","929":"","930":"","931":"","932":"","933":"","934":"Organotin compounds in polyvinyl chloride toys were determined by GC\/MS after ethyl derivatization with sodium tetraethylborate. The samples were 12 balls, 12 soft toys, 10 food toys and 13 face masks for children. Monooctyltin, dioctyltin and trioctyltin compounds were found in all face masks at the levels of 74.8-917 micrograms\/g. 474-3,960 micrograms\/g and 1.0-213 micrograms\/g, respectively. They also were detected in 6 balls, 4 soft toys and 1 food toy. Monomethyltin and dimethyltin compounds were found in 8 face masks at the levels of 40.9-227 micrograms\/g and 222-1,450 micrograms\/g, respectively. Monobutyltin and dibutyltin (DBT) compounds were found in 1 ball, 3 food toys and 5 face masks. In particular, 1 ball and 4 face masks contained toxic DBT at the levels of 527-999 micrograms\/g.","935":"Juice and integument of leaves of 3 Aloe species, Aloe vera, A. ferox and A. africana, are not allowed to be used as food according to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law in Japan. On the other hand, whole leaves of A. arborescens can be used as food. The present study was designed to distinguish Aloe species by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. DNA was isolated from fresh and dried leaves of the 4 Aloe species. Five out of 32 different 10-mer primers examined were useful for analysis. By comparison of the characteristic bands of PCR products on agarose gel, it was possible to distinguish the 4 species. Thus, the botanical species of Aloe in commercial food products can be identified by RAPD analysis.","936":"We have analyzed moxidectin residues in beef by a rapid and highly sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) method without fluorescent derivatization. By using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) with a fragment voltage of 100 V, good measurement results were obtained and the recoveries of moxidectin were 93.3% and 96.5% from adipose and muscle tissues, respectively. Identification of moxidectin residues in commercial beef was performed using three monitor ions. When quantitated at m\/z 622, the levels of moxidectin were 35 ng\/g in adipose tissue and 4.3 ng\/g in muscle tissue. After adjustment for fat content and calculation of the moxidectin concentration on a fat basis, it was found that the moxidectin contents were the same in adipose and muscle tissues. Thus, it is considered that residual levels of moxidectin in adipose and muscle tissues are correlated to the fat contents in the tissues.","937":"Mulberry leaf extract was studied toxicologically in male and female SD rats. The extract was administered orally at concentrations of 0% (control group), 0.1%, 0.4% and 1% in basal diet for 90 days. No remarkable change in test animals of both sexes was observed in terms of body weight gain or at necropsy. Hematology and blood chemistry revealed no abnormalities. Pathological examination revealed no toxic change in any organ observed. These findings indicate that dietary intake of 1% mulberry leaf extract for 90 days (884.5 mg\/kg\/day for males and 995.7 mg\/kg\/day for females as mean daily intake) causes no toxicological change in rats.","938":"In June 2000, there was a large-scale outbreak of food poisoning after consumption of Snow Brand low fat milk. In the evening of a day the incident made public, some cartons of low fat milk were brought to our laboratory for examination. Next day, we detected only staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A gene among SE (A-E) genes by PCR in left-over milk samples or samples from the same lots that patients had consumed. We presumed that the outbreak was caused by the intake of SEA. We subsequently confirmed the presence of SEA in these samples. To investigate the existence of SE (A-E) genes in milk, we examined 100 samples of commercial low fat milk and milk by PCR, but none of the genes was detected. We estimated the detection limit of SEA gene in low fat milk by PCR. Four strains of SEA-producing Staphylococcus aureus cultures were serially diluted in low fat milk. The SEA gene was detected at levels of 5.5 x 10(2) to 1.6 x 10(4) cfu\/mL of S. aureus. These amounts of S. aureus are higher than the values in raw milk reported previously. Therefore we consider that SE genes in low fat milk should usually be undetectable by our PCR. This study shows that quick detection of SE genes by PCR is very helpful to analyze outbreaks, especially if no significant bacterium can be cultured.","939":"Two peaks, A and B, detected in chromatograms of commercial frozen vegetable extracts during analysis of organophosphorus pesticide residues by GC-FPD, were identified as tris(2,4-ditert-butylphenyl)phosphite (Irgafos 168) and Irgafos 168 oxide, respectively, from their mass spectra. Irgafos 168 is used as an antioxidant in plastics, and there has been no report of its detection in foods. We analyzed Irgafos 168 and its oxide in 38 samples of commercial frozen vegetables, and they were detected from 4 samples (0.02-0.80 microgram\/g as total amount of Irgafos 168 and its oxide).","940":"","941":"S-421 is a synergist for pyrethroid and organophosphorus pesticides, and is widely used in termiticides or commercial household insecticides. S-421 is mutagenic, stable and ubiquitous in the environment, and has been detected in household dust, surface water, sediments and rain-water. Here we describe the concentration of S-421 residues in domestic and imported fish collected in Osaka. S-421 was extracted with acetone\/hexane, purified through silica gel 40 and quantified by ECD-GC. S-421 was detected in 36 out of 44 samples of domestic fish and shellfish analyzed, at a level of &lt; 0.2 to 2.3 ng\/g (mean: 0.6 ng\/g), and in 27 out of 43 imported samples at a level of &lt; 0.2 to 1.0 ng\/g (mean: 0.2 ng\/g). The levels of S-421 detected in fish were lower than those of DDTs and almost the same as those of HCHs. More attention should be paid to the behavior in the environment of S-421, as well as other persistent organochlorine pollutants, such as HCHs, DDTs and chlordane.","942":"We investigated the labeling and content of plasticizers of soft plastic toys. First, we investigated material labeling in 96 products purchased in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Among these products, 43% of those purchased in fiscal 2000 and 68% of those purchased in fiscal 2001 were labeled. We then investigated the kinds and amounts of plasticizers in 73 soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) toys. Three kinds of phthalates and six other kinds of plasticizers were detected in the soft PVC toys. Diisononyl phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, diisononyl adipate, and O-acetyl tributyl citrate were detected at high frequency, and in large amounts. The average total content of all plasticizers was 280 mg\/g for the products purchased in fiscal 2000 and 227 mg\/g for those in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001, antioxidants, 4-nonylphenol, and bisphenol A were investigated in addition to plasticizers.","943":"An analytical method was developed for determination of organochlorine, pyrethroid and nitrogen-containing pesticide residues in agricultural products by GC\/MS, GC-ECD and GC-FTD. Pesticides were extracted with acetonitrile, and the organic layer was cleaned up on C18 and ENVI-Carb\/LC-NH2 cartridges. Pesticides were determined by GC\/MS, GC-ECD and GC-FTD. Detection limits of pesticides by GC\/MS and GC were below 1-30 ng\/g and 1-3 ng\/g, respectively. Recoveries of 27 out of 53 pesticides determined by GC\/MS and 47 out of 53 determined by GC were 70-120%. This method was useful for the multiresidue analysis of pesticides in agricultural products. Pesticide residues in 81 domestic crops were investigated from April 2001 to March 2002. Residues of 31 pesticides were detected from 21 crops.","944":"A new logistic model for bacterial growth was developed in this study. The model is based on a logistic model, which is often applied for biological and ecological population kinetics. The new model is described by a differential equation and contains an additional term for suppression of the growth rate during the lag phase, compared with the original logistic equation. The new model successfully described sigmoidal growth curves of Escherichia coli and Salmonella under various initial conditions. Data for E. coli were obtained from our experiments and data for Salmonella from the literature. When the new model was compared with a modified Gompertz model, which is widely used by many predictive microbiology researchers, it proved to be superior to the Gompertz model. Further, Salmonella growth at varying temperature could be well simulated by the new model. These results indicate that the new model will be a useful tool to predict bacterial growth under various temperature profiles.","945":"A simple and reliable method using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC\/ESI-MS) has been developed for the determination of the macrolide antibiotics spiramycin and tilmicosin in meat and fish. The drugs were extracted from meat and fish with 0.2% metaphosphoric acid-methanol (6:4), and the extracts were cleaned up on an Oasis HLB cartridge (60 mg). Positive ionization produced the molecular related ions, (M + 2H)2+, at m\/z 350.2, 422.3 and 435.3 for neospiramycin I, spiramycin I and tilmicosin, respectively. The LC separation was performed on a Capcell Pak MG-C18 column (150 x 2 mm i.d.) with a gradient system of 0.02% formic acid-acetonitrile as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL\/min. The molecular-related ions of the drugs were very clear under this condition. The calibration graph for each drug was rectilinear from 0.05 to 5 ng with selected ion monitoring (SIM). The recoveries of the drugs from meat and fish fortified at the level of 0.2 microgram\/g was 73.2-89.2%, with high precision. The limits of detection of the drugs in meat and fish were 0.01 microgram\/g.","946":"Milled rice and bran were prepared from brown rice (Oryza sativa japonica) using a commercial scale rice-mill to investigate the changes in cadmium (Cd) content caused by the milling process. Rice sample solution was prepared by microwave digestion using HNO3 and HF, then analyzed by ICP-MS. Cd was measured at m\/z 114 in interference correction with MoO and Sn. The digestion method was validated with 4 kinds of certified reference material of \"rice flour\". We found that the Cd content was reduced only slightly by the milling process. When the Cd concentration of brown rice was regarded as 100, the relative content of the milled rice was 97 (average of 6 samples). In addition, the reduction of the Cd content was only slight when milled rice was processed to \"wash-free\" rice. The relative Cd content of the bran was 139 when that of brown rice was regarded as 100. These results support the hypothesis that the Cd content is not greatly decreased by the milling process.","947":"","948":"","949":"","950":"","951":"","952":"The mean concentration and daily intake of inorganic food additives (nitrite, nitrate, and sulfur dioxide), antioxidants (BHA and BHT), a processing agent (propylene glycol), and a sweetener (sodium saccharin) were estimated based on the results of an analysis of 34,489 food samples obtained in official inspections by 106 local governments in Japan in fiscal year 1998. The ratios of mean concentrations of these seven food additives to each allowable limit were 20.0%, 53.9%, 15.5%, 6.2%, 0.4%, 18.5%, and 5.7%, respectively. The daily intakes of these food additives estimated from their concentrations in foods and the daily consumption of foods were 0.205, 0.532, 4.31, 0.119, 0.109, 77.5, and 7.27 mg per person, respectively. These amounts were 6.8%, 0.3%, 12.3%, 0.5%, 0.7%, 6.2%, and 2.6% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI), respectively, when body weight was assumed to be 50 kg. No remarkable differences in the daily intakes of these seven food additives or the ratios to the ADI were observed compared with the results based on the official inspections in fiscal years 1994 and 1996.","953":"A simple and rapid method is described for the determination of the non-registered pesticides, captafol, quintozene (PCNB), cyhexatin and 1-naphthylacetic acid (NAA), in fruits. These pesticides were extracted with acidified acetone, then captafol and PCNB were purified with a Florisil mini column and analyzed by GC-ECD. Cyhexatin was ethylated with ethylmagnesium bromide, and the ethyl derivative was analyzed by GC-FPD (Sn filter). NAA was purified with liquid-liquid extraction and determined by HPLC equipped with a fluorescence detector. These analytes were identified with GC\/MS or LC\/MS. The minimum identified concentration of the pesticides was below 0.2 ng per injection, which corresponds to a detection limit of below 0.02 microgram\/g in the original samples. Recoveries of the pesticides spiked at 0.1 microgram\/g into apple, Japanese pear and melon were greater than 61%.","954":"The cleanup procedure for the determination of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in food samples using a disposable pre-packed multi-layer silica gel column (multi-layer dioxin tube; D-tube) was evaluated. The blank test showed the need for conditioning of the column with n-hexane. To compare the method with the D-tube and the conventional method for the analyses of actual food samples, seven food samples (spinach, komatsuna, rice, salmon, beef, egg and butter) were extracted by shaking with acetone-n-hexane or n-hexane after alkaline treatment, and then the extracts were cleaned up by use of the D-tube or the prepared conventional column, followed by several column chromatographic steps. Both cleanup procedures gave similar values at each isomeric concentration level and showed similar efficiency with favorable recoveries. The results suggest that the D-tube is applicable to cleanup for the analysis of PCDD\/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in foods.","955":"A reversed-phase HPLC method with ultraviolet detection using p-nitrophenyl hydrazine as a pre-column derivatizing reagent was investigated for the determination of the antibiotic spectinomycin (SPCM) in muscle, liver, kidney and fat of chicken and swine. SPCM was extracted from samples with 10% trichloroacetic acid saturated with EDTA-2Na, and then cleaned up with coupled Sep-Pak Plus PS-2 cartridges. The detection limit of SPCM was 0.02 microgram (potency)\/g. Recoveries of SPCM ranged from 77.4 to 97.4% for chicken tissues and from 74.5 to 91.8% for swine tissues. The present method was used for the analysis of chicken tissues after the 11th day of withdrawal (SPCM-medicated drinking water: 500 mg (potency)\/L, for 7 days), and swine tissues after the 14th day of withdrawal (SPCM-medicated feed: 100 mg (potency)\/kg, for 7 days). Results showed that SPCM concentrations were lower than the MRLs in all tissues.","956":"A simple and rapid determination of anticoccidial drug residues, diclazuril (DCZ) and nicarbazin (NCZ), in chicken tissues has been developed. DCZ and NCZ were extracted with acetonitrile from chicken liver, muscle, and fat. The extract was rinsed with n-hexane saturated with acetonitrile and then evaporated. The residue was dissolved in 1.4 mL of acetonitrile-methanol (1:1), then 1.0 mL of n-hexane saturated with acetonitrile-methanol (1:1) was added, and the mixture was partitioned by the addition of 0.6 mL of water. DCZ and NCZ in the aqueous layers were determined by HPLC on an Xterra RP-18 column with acetonitrile-0.5% ammonium acetate containing 0.01 mol\/L tetra-n-butylammonium hydrogen sulfate (43:57) as the mobile phase. The mean recoveries (n = 5) of DCZ and NCZ spiked in chicken tissues at the maximum residue levels were 92.0-95.6% (CV 2.4-3.0%) and 87.3-89.4% (CV 1.7-2.8%), respectively. The detection limits of DCZ and NCZ were 0.01 and 0.004 microgram\/g, respectively.","957":"Polyvinyl chloride gloves containing di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate are restricted for food contact use. In their place, disposable gloves made from nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) are used in contact with foodstuffs. Some unknown substances were found to migrate into n-heptane from NBR gloves. By GC\/MS, HR-MS and NMR, their chemical structures were confirmed to be 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol diisobutyrate (used as a plasticizer), 4,4'-butylidenedi(6-tert-butyl-m-cresol), a mixture of styrenated phenols consisting of 2-(alpha-methylbenzyl)phenol, 4-(alpha-methylbenzyl)phenol, 2,6-di(alpha-methylbenzyl)phenol, 2,4-di(alpha-methylbenzyl)phenol and 2,4,6-tri(alpha-methylbenzyl)phenol (used as antioxidants), and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, which seems to a degradation product of antioxidant. Migration levels of these compounds were 1.68 micrograms\/cm2 of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, 2.80 micrograms\/cm2 of 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol diisobutyrate, 46.08 micrograms\/cm2 of styrenated phenols and 4.22 micrograms\/cm2 of 4,4'-butylidenedi(6-tert-butyl-m-cresol) into n-heptane, respectively. The content of total styrenated phenols was 6,900 micrograms\/g in NBR gloves.","958":"Daily oral exposure of babies to phthalate was estimated on the basis of the mouthing time of infants and the oral concentration of diisononyl phthalate (DINP) released from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) toy specimens. Total mouthing time, including the use of pacifiers, ranged widely from 11.4 min to 351.8 min with the mean of 105.3 +\/- 72.1 min. The mean of the total mouthing time without pacifiers was 73.9 +\/- 32.9 min. The average amount of DINP in saliva was 92.4 +\/- 56.8 micrograms\/10 cm2\/hr, ranging from 13.2 micrograms\/10 cm2\/hr to 240.4 micrograms\/10 cm2\/hr. The exposure of phthalate in two different trials was estimated by the method of Monte Carlo simulation, one with the total mouthing time with pacifiers and the other with the total mouthing time without pacifiers. The average exposure in the former trial was 21.4 micrograms\/kg\/day and the 95th percentile was 65.8 micrograms\/kg\/day, while in the latter it was 14.8 micrograms\/kg\/day and the 95th percentile was 35.7 micrograms\/kg\/day.","959":"An LC\/MS method was developed for the determination of acrylamide (AA) in processed or cooked foods. AA was extracted with a mixture of water and acetone from homogenized food samples after the addition of 13C-labeled acrylamide (AA-1-(13)C) as an internal standard. The extract was concentrated, washed with dichloromethane for defatting, and cleaned up on Bond Elut C18, PSA and ACCUCAT cartridge-columns, and then AA was determined by LC\/MS in the selected ion recording (SIR) mode. For the LC\/MS analysis, four LC columns were connected in-line and the flow of the mobile phase was switched according to a time-program. Monitoring ions for AA were m\/z 72 and 55, and those for AA-1-(13)C were m\/z 73 and 56. AA and AA-1-(13)C were determined without interference from the matrices in all samples. The recoveries of AA from potato chips, corn snack, pretzel and roasted tea spiked at the level of 500 ng\/g of AA were 99.5-101.0% with standard deviations (SD) in the range from 0.3 to 1.6%. The limits of detection and quantification of the developed method were 9 and 30 ng\/g for AA in samples, respectively. The method was applied to the analysis of AA in various processed or cooked food samples purchased from retail markets. High levels of AA were found in potato chips and French-fried potato (467-3,544 ng\/g). Fried and sugar-coated dough cakes (karinto) contained 374 and 1,895 ng\/g. Corn snacks contained 117-535 ng\/g of AA. Roasted foods (such as roasted sesame seed, roasted barley (mugi-cha), roasted tea (hoji-cha), coffee beans and curry powder) contained 116-567 ng\/g of AA. Foods made from fish, egg and meat contained lower levels of AA than the plant-based foods. Foods containing much water showed a tendency to have low levels of AA compared with dry foods. The proposed method was applicable to the analysis of AA in variety of processed foods.","960":"Recently we have developed new kinetic methods of bacterial cell estimation in food products by measurement of the increase in bacterial adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) content during incubation using a conventional firefly luminometer [Fujikawa and Morozumi: Jpn. J. Food Hyg. (2002)]. The methods were the end point method and the delay method. We, in this study, evaluated these methods for bacterial concentration estimation in commercial foods. The methods were successfully applied to food products inoculated with Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. The methods were then used to estimate bacterial concentrations in commercial foods. For estimation, the kinetic parameter values were determined first from the data of bacterial strains studied previously. The bacterial concentrations estimated with these parameter values were slightly smaller than the measured concentrations for most of the food samples. The parameter values obtained with the least-squares method gave better estimations in both methods. The delay method predicted the bacterial concentrations in food products better than the end point method. This study showed that with appropriate parameter values, these methods could be useful tools for bacterial concentration estimation of commercial foods.","961":"A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) method for determining the enzymatic activity of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP synthase), an enzyme of the shikimate pathway, was developed. EPSP synthase catalyzes the formation of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) from shikimate-3-phosphate (S-3-P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in microorganisms and plants. The enzymatic activity of EPSP synthase was assessed by the determination of EPSP after a 30-min incubation with S-3-P and PEP using the LC\/MS system. EPSP synthase activity is given in terms of the produced EPSP (pmol\/min\/mg protein). Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine)-tolerant EPSP synthase from the Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4 (CP4-EPSP synthase) in genetically modified soybeans (GM-soybeans) was found to have an enzymatic activity of 736 EPSP pmol\/min\/mg protein in the presence of 3 nmol of S-3-P. In contrast, the enzyme activity of non-GM-soybeans was 21 EPSP pmol\/min\/mg protein. The EPSP synthase activity was markedly decreased in the non-GM-soybeans by the addition of glyphosate, but the enzyme activity of the GM-soybeans was only slightly decreased with this treatment. This LC\/MS system could also be applicable to the measurement of EPSP synthase activity in different plant species and the detection of herbicide-tolerant EPSP synthase in GM foods.","962":"","963":"","964":"","965":"","966":"The natural food color gardenia red is manufactured through the hydrolysis of the methyl ester of iridoid glucoside. Gardenia blue is also made from iridoid glucoside. Therefore, there is a possibility that the commercial products contain methanol. To determine methanol in gardenia red and gardenia blue, a headspace GC method with standard addition was developed. In the case of gardenia blue with the methyl ester, methanol may be formed during the analytical procedures for methanol. Thus, conditions in which methanol would not be produced in the headspace-GC method were investigated. Vials containing 1 g of the color preparation, 1 mL of water, and a standard solution were sealed. Equilibrium temperature was an important factor among the conditions for analyzing methanol in gardenia blue. Although at room temperature and 50 degrees C, the contents of methanol were equal, the content increased 1.2 times at 80 degrees C. Methanol contents determined at 50 degrees C were 8 and 9 micrograms\/g in two gardenia red products and 25-34 micrograms\/g in three gardenia blue products, which were below the residual limit of 50 micrograms\/g set for many other natural food additives.","967":"An analytical method was developed for determination of residual avoparcin in chicken muscle by measuring alpha- and beta-avoparcin, major components of the pharmaceutical preparation avoparcin, using HPLC with UV and amperometric detectors. The analytical HPLC was run on a Cosmosil 5C18-AR column (4.6 mm x 25 cm) with a gradient formed from A: 2.5% acetic acid, 0.01 mol\/L sodium heptane sulfonic acid-acetonitrile (88.5:11.5) (pH 4.0) and B: 2.5% acetic acid-acetonitrile (10:90), using UV and amperometric detection (AMD) with glassy-carbon electrode (+900 mV). Avoparcin was extracted from chicken muscle by homogenization with methanol-0.2 mol\/L sulfuric acid (6:4) followed by centrifugation after pH adjustment to 4 with 1 mol\/L sodium hydroxide. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in water. The aqueous layer was adjusted to pH 4 by adding 1 mol\/L sodium hydroxide. Then it was purified on a Sep-Pak tC18 plus ENV cartridge. The cartridge was washed with water, and retained substances were eluted with 50% methanol. The eluate was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in water and determined by HPLC. Recoveries of avoparcin spiked in chicken muscle were 73.1-88.1% at levels of 2-10 micrograms\/g. The detection limits were 0.5 microgram\/g (UV) and 0.2 microgram\/g (AMD).","968":"A simplified simultaneous analytical method of imazalil (IZ) and its major metabolite, alpha-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-ethanol (IZM), in citrus fruits was developed, and commodities samples were investigated. A homogenate of citrus fruits was extracted with ethyl acetate under basic conditions. The crude extract was partitioned between 0.025 mol\/L of sulfuric acid and ethyl acetate. The analytes were extracted from the aqueous fraction under basic conditions with ethyl acetate. The extract solution was purified with an ENVI-Carb cartridge, and then analyzed by GC-FTD and GC\/MS. Recoveries of IZ and IZM added to grapefruit at the level of 0.05 microgram\/g were 90.0 and 108.7%, and those in the case of lemon were 100.4 and 93.0%, respectively. The detection limits were 0.01 microgram\/g in samples. By this method, IZ and IZM were analyzed in 46 citrus fruits on the market and were detected simultaneously in some samples.","969":"Water extracts of 32 herbs that are constituents of curry and curry powder were screened for superoxide anion radical (O2.-) scavenging activity. Among the screened samples, only clove, allspice, and basil were shown to decrease DMPO-O2.- adduct yields by more than 50% at 0.25 mg\/mL as measured by an ESR spin trapping technique based on the HPX-XOD reaction. To study the mechanism of the O2.- scavenging activity, Km values were obtained from a Lineweaver-Burk plot for XOD in the presence of different concentrations of HPX, and the IC50 values at different DMPO concentrations were compared. Clove and basil directly eliminated O2.- like superoxide dismutase (SOD), whereas allspice reduced the amount of O2.- by inhibition of formation of O2.-.","970":"Gas production in lactose-containing medium (e.g., BGLB, LB, or EC medium) is the most important characteristic in the E. coli\/Coliform group (C.F.G.) test on food and water. Generally a Durham tube is used as the fermentation tube, and the collected gas is analyzed. However, difficulties can arise, such as insufficient gas volume or muddy precipitates. Since air clings well to fibers in water, the Tsunoda tube (T-tube), a stalk-like tube stuffed with synthetic fibers which can capture the gas more precisely and easily, was designed. With this T-tube, air elimination during the preparation of the medium and detection of gas, even in small quantities, are both simplified. Our results show that the T-tube can replace the Durham tube as a device for detecting gas-production by the E. coli\/Coliform group, with improved accuracy and sensitivity.","971":"The effect of exogenous polyamines (cadaverine, putrescine, norspermidine, spermidine, and spermine) on the growth, toxicity, and toxin profile of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum T1 was examined. It was found that cadaverine at concentrations of 0.1-2.0 mumol\/L enhanced the growth of A. minutum T1. Putrescine and norspermidine at a low level (0.1 mumol\/L) also promoted the algal growth. Spermidine depressed the algal growth. However, the cell toxicity levels of A. minutum T1 cultured with or without cadaverine, putrescine, norspermidine, and spermidine were almost the same. The toxic components of A. minutum T1 were GTXs 1-4 only, and GTXs 1 and 4 were predominant (74.6 +\/- 7.1%) in all cultures. On the other hand, spermine did not effect the growth of A. minutum T1, though it decreased the cell toxicity and the ratio of GTX 2 + GTX 3 (15.0 +\/- 6.6%).","972":"'Magic mushrooms' (MMs) are psychoactive fungi containing the hallucinogenic compounds, psilocin (1) and psilocybin (2). Since June 6, 2002, these fungi have been regulated by the Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law in Japan. Because there are many kinds of MMs and they are sold even as dry powders in local markets, it is very difficult to identify the original species of the MMs by morphological observation. Therefore, we investigated the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region in the ribosomal RNA gene of MMs obtained in Japanese markets to classify them by a genetic approach. Based on the size and nucleotide sequence of the ITS region amplified by PCR, tested MMs were classified into 6 groups. Furthermore, a comparison of the DNA sequences of the MMs with those of authentic samples or with those found in the databases (GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ) made it possible to identify the species of tested MMs. Analysis by LC revealed that psilocin (1) was contained at the highest level in Panaeolus cyanescens among the MMs, but was absent in the Amanita species.","973":"An improved method for determination of bisphenol A (BPA), phenol (PH), p-tert-butylphenol (PTBP) and diphenylcarbonate (DPC) in polycarbonate products was developed without using the hazardous solvent dichloromethane. Polycarbonate samples were ground to powder or cut into small pieces, and 0.5 g was soaked in 5 mL of acetonitrile for 24 hours at 40 degrees C. The test solution was then filtered and subjected to HPLC analysis. The proposed method was evaluated by comparison of the results with those of the standard method for 14 polycarbonate products. Extraction ratios (average values obtained by the present method\/average values obtained by the standard method) of BPA, PH, PTBP and DPC were 0.89-1.19, 0.89-1.14, 0.94-1.30 and 1.08-1.11, respectively. While 120 mL\/sample of organic solvent is required in the standard method, only 5 mL\/sample of acetonitrile was used in our new method.","974":"Migration from can-coatings into retorted canned food simulants (canned oil and water, 121 degrees C, 30 min) was investigated through HPLC with a fluorescence detector and evaporative light scattering detector, and by measurements of residue on evaporation and consumption of potassium permanganate. HPLC analysis revealed that migration into the canned oil was hundreds of times more than that into n-heptane (25 degrees C, 60 min, the official test conditions according to the Japanese Food Sanitation Law), whereas it was similar to the migration into isooctane-butyl acetate mixtures (60 degrees C, 60 min), and that migration into the canned water was several times more than that into water (95 degrees C, 30 min, the official test conditions). Residue on evaporation for the n-heptane extract was several-fold lower than 30 ppm (the official limit), whereas that for the isooctane-butyl acetate mixtures exceeded 30 ppm. Consumption of potassium permanganate for the canned water was 30 times higher than that for the water extract (95 degrees C, 30 min). The official test conditions for can-coatings, in particular the use of n-heptane as an oil simulant, were suggested to lead to substantial underestimation of migration into canned food.","975":"A simple and rapid method using HPLC was developed for the determination of tricresyl phosphate (TCP) in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) articles. A test sample was extracted with acetonitrile at 37 degrees C overnight. The extract solution diluted with an equivalent amount of water was applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, and TCP was eluted with acetonitrile-water (2:1) mixture. The eluate was analyzed by HPLC with an Inertsil Ph-3 column, using 65% acetonitrile\/water as the mobile phase, with UV detection (264 nm). The calibration curve was rectilinear from 0.5 to 100 micrograms\/mL. The recoveries of TCP added to various kinds of PVC articles at the level of 1,000 micrograms\/g were 84.7-98.6%. The determination limit of TCP was 50 micrograms\/g in samples. This method was applied to products including 3.1, 6.6 and 8.8% TCP and the recoveries of TCP were 87.3-91.4%. This method is very simple, and it seems suitable for a regulatory test.","976":"An analytical method using GC\/MS for the detection of 4 kinds of dietary emulsifiers, glycerin, sucrose, sorbitan and propylene glycol monoesters of fatty acids (GE, SuE, SE, PGE), in beverages was developed. The emulsifiers were extracted from beverages with tetrahydrofuranethyl acetate (6:4) by homogenizing. The extract was cleaned up on a silica gel column and subsequently a C8 cartridge column, followed by acetylation. The derivatives were then detected by GC\/MS. Our newly established method enabled to characterize 4 kinds of emulsifiers and also to identify their fatty acids without hydrolysis or de-esterification. When this method was applied to various beverages on the market, many GE and SuE with different fatty acids were detected. These results suggested that several dietary emulsifiers are used as food additives at the same time in beverages on the market.","977":"We describe a method of mechanical agitation to determine rates of dialkyl phthalate migration from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products into saliva simulant. The method consists of rotary shaking of a sample with 30 mL of saliva simulant (pH 7.0) at 35 degrees C in a 50 mL glass tube at 300 rpm for 15 min, then measuring the amount of dialkyl phthalate in the saliva simulant by HPLC with a UV detector. The migration rates of diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) from PVC plates containing about 45% (w\/w) plasticizer (molded in our laboratory) were identical. However, the migration rates from molded plates containing 13% (w\/w) DBP were almost double those of DINP and DEHP at the same ratios. In addition, the amounts of DINP that migrated in vitro after rotary shaking for 15 min were equivalent to those in vivo determined in saliva from volunteers who chewed plates for 60 min. The migration rates of dialkyl phthalates from 11 commercially available toys ranged from 15.6 to 85.2 micrograms\/cm2\/h [relative standard deviation (RSD), 3 to 12%].","978":"We studied the effect of cleaning and cooking on the residues of flutolanil, fenobucarb, silafluofen and buprofezin in rice. The rice had been sprayed in a paddy field in Wakayama city, with 3 kinds of pesticide application protocols: spraying once at the usual concentration of pesticides, repeated spraying (3 times) with the usual concentration of pesticides and spraying once with 3 times the usual concentration of pesticides. The residue levels of pesticide decreased during the rice cleaning process. Silafluofen, which has a higher log Pow value, remained in the hull of the rice. Fenobucarb, which has a lower log Pow value, penetrated inside the rice. The residue concentration of pesticide in polished rice was higher than that in pre-washed rice processed ready for cooking. During the cooking procedure, the reduction of pesticides in polished rice was higher than that in brown rice.","979":"A simple and rapid method for the simultaneous determination of five penicillins (ampicillin, penicillin G, penicillin V, oxacillin and cloxacillin) in muscle, liver and kidney tissues using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS\/MS) was developed. Mass spectral acquisition was done in the negative ion mode by applying selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The five penicillins were extracted with water, and the extracted solution was cleaned up on a C18 cartridge. Phenethicillin was added as an internal standard, and the extract was diluted with water for injection into the LC-ESI-MS\/MS. The recoveries of the five penicillins were in the range of 77.3-99.8% from muscle, liver and kidney fortified at 10-250 ng\/g. The detection limits for ampicillin were 6 ng\/g in muscle and kidney and 15 ng\/g in liver. For penicillin G and penicillin V, the detection limits were 2 ng\/g in muscle and kidney and 5 ng\/g in liver. For oxacillin and cloxacillin, the detection limits were 4 ng\/g in muscle and kidney and 10 ng\/g in liver. Twenty-three muscle, fourteen liver and twenty-two kidney samples from the markets were analyzed by this method. No penicillins were detected in any sample.","980":"","981":"","982":"Residues of 17 pesticides in agricultural products were determined by LC\/MS with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface in both positive and negative ion modes. Pesticides were extracted with acetonitrile, and the extracts were cleaned-up with a primary and secondary amine (PSA) mini-column eluted with acetone-hexane (1:1). Rice, orange and potato were spiked with the 17 pesticides at 0.1 microgram\/g and analyzed by the proposed method. The average recoveries of these pesticides usually ranged from 70 to 98% and the relative standard deviations were usually around 10%. These results suggested that LC\/MS with APCI could be used to determine the residue levels of the 17 pesticides in these crops.","983":"Salivary glands from 29 species of marine carnivorous gastropods in nine families were examined for lethal activity against mice and tetramine content. Mouse lethality was assayed by intravenous injection of buffer extracts into mice, and was detected in 14 species. Heat-stability tests confirmed that toxins in four species were thermolabile, while those in eight species were thermostable. Based on the tetramine contents determined by the colorimetric method using methanolic extracts, the thermostable toxins in seven species (Neptunea eulimatalamellosa, N. vinosa, N. arthritica, N. bulbacea, N. intersculpta f. pribiloffensis, N. intersculpta f. frater pilsbry and Hemifusus tuba) were considered to be tetramine contained at high levels (more than 900 micrograms\/g salivary gland), but that in one species (Buccinum opisthoplectum) appeared to be a low-molecular-weight compound differing from tetramine. It is interesting that one (Hemifusus tuba) of the seven species containing high amounts of tetramine belongs to the family Melongenidae, although the other six Neptunea species are members of the family Buccinidae, as expected from previous studies.","984":"Plasticizers in cap-sealing for bottled foods were analyzed. Twenty-three domestic samples and 80 imported samples, a total of 103 samples, were tested. Among them, 93 contained chloride, and 62 contained di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisodecyl phthalate, O-acetyl tributyl citrate, diacetyllauroyl glycerol, di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, diisononyl phthalate or dicyclohexyl phthalate. Twelve samples with DEHP-containing caps were further tested for plasticizer levels in the foods. Higher DEHP was detected in oily and fluid food specimens. However, the intake of plasticizers calculated based on usual food consumption did not exceed the tolerable daily intake level in any of the cases. A food sample containing the highest level of DEHP was stored under various conditions, and DEHP that migrated from the cap-sealing into the food was determined. Shaking the bottles increased migration of DEHP into foods.","985":"A method was developed for the determination of trace amounts of acrylamide (AA) in foods. The method includes the addition of 13C-labeled acrylamide-1-13C (AA-1-13C) as an internal standard, extraction with water, bromination, clean-up with a Florisil cartridge column, dehydrobromination and GC\/MS analysis in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Bromination of AA to 2,3-dibromopropionamide (2,3-DBPA) was done using potassium bromide and potassium bromate under an acidic condition. 2,3-DBPA was converted to 2-bromopropenamide (2-BPA) by dehydrobromination with triethylamine before GC\/MS analysis. The recoveries of AA from spiked potato chips, corn snack, pretzel and roasted tea were 97-105%, and their relative standard deviations were 0.8-3.9%. The detection limit of AA in foods was 9 ng\/g. The method was applied to thirty-one foods purchased from retail markets. AA was found in potato chips at the level of 466-3,340 ng\/g, and in other foods at the level of ND-520 ng\/g.","986":"A performance study of an analytical method of ethoxyquin (ET) in apples and pears was conducted. In the proposed method, the sample was homogenized with thiourea and ET was extracted with acetone instead of hexane used in the official analytical method for ET, in order to improve the extraction efficiency. Furthermore, dibutyl hydroxytoluene was added in the test solution to prevent the decomposition of ET. For evaluation of the method. ET spiked into apples and pears at the level of 0.2 microgram\/g was determined in replicate in six laboratories. Mean recoveries from apple, pear and Japanese pear were 85.3, 83.0 and 83.9%, respectively. Repeatability relative standard deviation values were 3.8-4.7% and reproducibility relative standard deviation values were 7.8-11.3%. The detection limits were 0.001-0.025 microgram\/g in the six laboratories; this value may reflect instrument performance. ET spiked into apples and pears at the level of 0.2 microgram\/g was detected by both LC\/MS and GC\/MS.","987":"An unknown peak was detected in a GC chromatogram of many kiwi fruit extracts during analysis for pesticide residues. It was identified by GC\/MS as diphenyl 2-ethylhexyl phosphate (DPEHP), used as a plasticizer and flame retardant. The concentration of DPEHP was investigated in 15 samples of kiwi fruit, and it was detected at between 0.02 and 0.14 microgram\/g in 10 of the samples. It might be due to migration of DPEHP into the fruit from the printed portion of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) package.","988":"A simplified HPLC determination method for maleic hydrazide in agricultural products was developed, and commercial agricultural crops were investigated. The homogenate of agricultural products was extracted with water. The crude extract was purified on an ACCUCAT Bond Elut extraction cartridge using water. Maleic hydrazide was analyzed by HPLC with UV detection (303 nm). The HPLC separation was performed on a ZORBAX SB-Aq column with acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid(5:95:0.01) as the mobile phase. Recoveries of maleic hydrazide from 15 agricultural products fortified at 1.0 and 10 micrograms\/g were in the ranges of 92.6-104.9% and 94.2-101.3%, respectively. The limit of detection was 0.5 microgram\/g in samples. The proposed method was applied to the determination of 242 commercial vegetables and fruits. Maleic hydrazide was detected in 2 samples of imported onion at the levels of 4.9 and 7.2 micrograms\/g.","989":"Hokosshi extract is obtained by ethanol extraction from the seeds of hokosshi (Psoralea corylifolia), which is used as a Chinese medicine. The constituents of hokosshi extract were analyzed. The main constituent was isolated using column chromatography, and identified as bakuchiol by TLC, LC\/MS and NMR. Bavachinin A was also detected. In order to prepare a marker substance for hokosshi extract, bakuchiol was isolated from seeds of hokosshi using Sep-Pak cartridges. An analytical method for hokosshi extract in foods based on detection of bakuchiol was developed. Bakuchiol was extracted from food with 60 vol% ethanol. The extract was cleaned up using a Sep-Pak plus C18 cartridge, and bakuchiol was determined by HPLC. Seasoning and juice were spiked with hokosshi extract at 500 micrograms\/g and analyzed by the proposed method. The recoveries of bakuchiol were 72-99%. The detection limit for the assay was 25 micrograms\/g.","990":"A sensitive method for detecting bromate in bread by ion chromatography with inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC\/ICP-MS) was developed. Bromate was extracted from bread with water. The clean-up procedure included a 0.2 micron filter, a C18 cartridge for defatting, a silver cartridge to remove halogen anions, a centrifugal ultrafiltration unit to remove proteins, and a cation-exchange cartridge to remove silver ions. A 500 microL sample solution was applied to IC\/ICP-MS. The detection limit and the quantitation limit of bromate in the solution were 0.3 ng\/mL and 1.0 ng\/mL, expressed as HBrO3, respectively, which corresponded to 2 ng\/g and 5 ng\/g, respectively, in bread. Recovery of bromate was about 90%, and the CV was about 2%. Based on the detection limit in solution and recovery from bread, the detection limit of bromate in bread was estimated to be 2 ng\/g.","991":"Soyasaponins and isoflavones are main secondary metabolites in soybeans. In this report we compared the content of secondary metabolites between genetically modified (GM) and non-GM soybeans. Six cultivars\/lines of GM and six cultivars\/lines of non-GM soybeans were extracted with methanol. Each extract was partitioned with aqueous methanol and hexane and the aqueous methanol fraction was partially purified by HP-20 and LH-20 column chromatography to afford crude soyasaponin and isoflavone fractions. The main A-type soyasaponin, acetylsoyasaponin A1 (AcA1), and the main B-type soyasaponins, soyasaponins I and II (I and II), in the crude fractions were identified by LC\/MS analyses with authentic samples. The main isoflavones, daidzin, genistin, daidzein and genistein (DI, GI, DE and GE), in the crude fractions were identified by LC photo-diode array analyses with authentic samples. The contents of AcA1, I and II in the crude soyasaponin fractions and those of DI, GI, DE and GE in the crude isoflavone fractions were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. The average contents (mg\/100 g) of AcA1, I, II and total of B-type soyasaponins in GM soybeans were 36.4 +\/- 24.2, 51.2 +\/- 11.8, 26.4 +\/- 7.6 and 77.7 +\/- 18.5, respectively, and those in non-GM ones were 22.3 +\/- 14.7, 46.3 +\/- 17.8, 19.8 +\/- 9.1 and 65.9 +\/- 26.9, respectively. The average contents (mg\/100 g) of DI, GI, DE, GE and total isoflavones in GM soybeans were 93.1 +\/- 15.5, 121.8 +\/- 19.4, 0.073 +\/- 0.178, 0.320 +\/- 0.082 and 215.3 +\/- 33.3, respectively, and those in non-GM ones were 78.8 +\/- 34.6, 106.7 +\/- 28.3, 2.206 +\/- 4.468, 0.822 +\/- 0.754 and 188.5 +\/- 26.7, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in soyasaponin and isoflavone contents between GM and non-GM soybeans. Therefore, it was estimated that the GM soybeans are equivalent to the non-GM ones in terms of the composition of the main secondary metabolites.","992":"Twenty-one N-methylcarbamates (NMCs) and 12 of their metabolites or isomers in citrus fruits were simultaneously determined avoiding use of dichloromethane. NMCs in lemon, orange, and grapefruit were extracted with acetone, then the acetone was evaporated off and sodium chloride was added before extraction with ethyl acetate. The extract was evaporated and the residue was cleaned up on a combined mini-column set of Supelclean ENVI-Carb and Mega Bond Elut SAX cartridges. NMCs were determined by HPLC with post-column reaction and fluorescence detection. All of the NMCs in the orange sample were determined without interfering peaks. However 8 NMCs in lemon extract and 10 NMCs in grapefruit extract were not detected because interfering peaks appeared at similar retention times to those of the NMCs. These NMCs were determined using LC\/MS (SIM) and were well recovered. Eighty-three data sets obtained by HPLC and LC\/MS showed good similarity, with r2 = 0.9178. Recoveries were 60.1 to 97.8% for major NMCs at a fortification level of 0.1 ppm. The limit of detection by HPLC was 0.005 ppm NMCs in samples and a similar level applied to LC\/MS.","993":"The inhibition of bacterial growth in thawed cake kept under refrigeration and rapid evaluation methods for microbiological quality of the cake were investigated. The effects of the freezing temperature and the addition of ethanol or emulsifier on bacterial numbers in a cake model after storage for 72 hr at 10 degrees C following the thawing process were also studied. Bacterial growth in the cake model was inhibited by the additives under various freezing conditions. In addition, rapid evaluation methods for estimating bacterial numbers in the cake model after incubation for 72 hr at 10 degrees C were studied. High correlations were found between bacterial numbers in the cake model incubated for 24 hr at 20 degrees C and for 6 hr at 35 degrees C with tryptic soy broth and that of the cake model incubated for 72 hr at 10 degrees C. This result indicated that rapid evaluation by incubation for 24 hr at 20 degrees C or for 6 hr at 35 degrees C with tryptic soy broth can be used to predict the bacterial numbers in a cake model after incubation for 72 hr at 10 degrees C. Furthermore, the ATP-bioluminescence method was applied to shorten the testing time, because culture on an agar medium was not necessary.","994":"Two typical cleanup methods, sulfuric acid treatment and multi-layer silica gel column chromatography, for the determination of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dioxin-like PCBs) in seventeen food samples were examined and compared. Vegetables, fruits, cereals, fish, meat and dairy foods were extracted by conventional methods (shaking with acetone\/n-hexane or with n-hexane after alkaline treatment). The extracts were cleaned up by sulfuric acid treatment or multi-layer silica gel column chromatography, followed by several column chromatographic steps. Of the samples treated, the vegetable, fruit and cereal samples could be directly applied to the multi-layer silica gel column after extraction. However, the samples containing fats and oils such as fish, meat and dairy foods needed to be treated several times with concentrated sulfuric acid before multi-layer column chromatography, because these samples plugged the column with oily residues. Both cleanup methods gave similar values of isomeric concentrations and showed similar efficiency of purification, and the recoveries ranged from 40 to 120%. These results are considered to provide useful data for the efficient analysis of dioxins in foods which have wide-ranging compositions.","995":"Little is known about the effects of residual veterinary drugs on the allergic reaction, except for the antigenicity of antibiotics and synthetic antimicrobials. Therefore, 59 kinds of veterinary drugs were investigated for their effects on the IgE receptor-mediated beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells as an index of immediate allergic reaction. We found that the antibiotics chlorotetracycline, doxycycline, monensin, the synthetic antimicrobial pyrimethamine and the steroid hormone testosterone inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release. Most of the veterinary drugs showed no action, though the ionophores lasalocid, salinomycin and the steroid hormone hexestrol promoted beta-hexosaminidase release from injured cells. Based on the residual levels of these drugs and the frequencies of detection in actual food samples, it seems unlikely that these drugs have any immediate allergic effect in practice.","996":"A detection method using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed to detect genetically modified (GM) potato (NewLeaf Y potato; NL-Y), of which the mandatory assessment has not yet been completed in Japan. The potato sucrose synthase gene was used as an internal control. We designed a primer pair to specifically detect NL-Y without false-positive results in processed potato foods infected with the potato virus Y (PVY). The DNA introduced into NL-Y using the primer pair could be detected from potato powder samples containing 0.05% NL-Y. In addition, we designed primer pairs for recognizing the CryIIIA gene to detect the NewLeaf potato (NL), NewLeaf Plus potato (NL-P) and NL-Y and for recognizing p-FMV in order to detect NL-P and NL-Y. The proposed method was applied to the detection of NL-Y in 26 processed potato foods and NL-Y was not detected in any samples.","997":"A large volume injection head-space GC method was established for measuring low levels of residual methanol and ethanol in licorice extract used a food additive. A vial was kept at 50 degrees C in the oven of the head-space sampler. Injection of the head-space gas for 0.75 min into a Poraplot Q GC column with a initial oven temperature of 35 degrees C, enabled the determination of low levels (5 micrograms\/g) of methanol and ethanol. The standard deviations for five rounds of analysis of methanol and ethanol in licorice extracts were between 0.82 and 2.97. Methanol was found in 6 samples out of 9 collected in 1999, at concentrations exceeding 50 micrograms\/g, the limit set by the Japanese Government, established in 1999 and coming into force on April 1, 2000. The highest concentration reached 10,000 micrograms\/g. Methanol at a concentration exceeding 50 micrograms\/g was found in 2 out of 9 samples collected in 2000. The highest concentration was 270 micrograms\/g.","998":"The development of a sensitive pre-column derivatization high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for determination of sucralose is reported. Sucralose is converted into a strongly ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing derivative, possessing strong absorption at 260 nm, by treatment with p-nitrobenzoyl chloride (PNBCl). Homogenized samples were dialyzed and washed with a Bond Elut ENV cartridge, then the eluate was evaporated to dryness and the residue was derivatized. Subsequently, the sucralose derivative was purified with hexane-ethyl actate (9:1) in a silica cartridge, and then the sucralose derivative was eluted with acetone. HPLC was performed on a phenyl column, using acetonitrile-water (73:27) as a mobile phase with UV detection (260 nm). The calibration curve was linear in the range of 1 microgram\/mL to 50 micrograms\/mL of sucralose. The recoveries of sucralose from eight kinds of foods spiked at the levels of 0.20 and 0.05 g\/kg of sucralose were more than 76.2% with SD values in the range from 0.90% to 4.31%. The quantitative limit of the developed method was 0.005 g\/kg for sucralose in samples.","999":"Ion-trap GC\/MS\/MS was evaluated for the multi-residue determination of pesticides in agricultural products. Matrices were extracted from samples (spinach, carrot, onion and brown rice) with acetone and submitted to gel permeation chromatography, followed by a clean-up step through a graphite carbon cartridge. Thirty-five pesticides were added to either matrix, and analyzed by GC\/MS\/MS. Detection limits of pesticides by GC\/MS\/MS was almost the same as those by GC\/MS (SIM). Coefficients of variation of peak area in 5 measurements of each pesticide at 0.1 microgram\/mL or 0.05 microgram\/mL with or without matrices were mostly acceptable, though those of 20 pesticides out of 35 were higher than 10% at a concentration of 0.02 microgram\/mL. It was indicated that matrix artifacts, which interfere with GC\/MS-Scan analysis, could be eliminated in some cases by using GC\/MS\/MS.","1000":"Subchronic animal feeding studies to examine the effect on the immune system of genetically modified corn CBH351, which contains the Cry9C protein derived from Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies tolworthi, were conducted in female BN rats and B10A mice. The studies were designed to compare the effect of a line of genetically modified corn CBH351 (GM corn) with that of isoline corn (non-GM corn). Heat-treated corn meal was incorporated into the diets of the rats and mice at a concentration of 50%. The study duration was 13 weeks. Growth, food intake, and organ weights of the thymus, spleen, and liver were compared between animals fed the non-GM and GM lines. The histological findings in thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, small intestines, liver, kidney, and bone marrow, and the presence of Cry9C-specific IgE, IgG, IgG1 and IgA antibodies in serum were also compared. The results showed no significant differences in growth, feeding value, or the histological findings in immunity-related organs between the animals fed the GM and non-GM lines. Production of Cry9 C-specific IgE and IgA was not detected in the serum of either group. Production of Cry9C-specific IgG and IgG1 was slightly increased in the 50% GM groups of BN rats. No Cry9C-specific IgG or IgG1 was detected in the serum of BN rats fed the diet containing 5% GM-corn In conclusion, no immunotoxic activity was detected in the GM-corn-fed rats and mice in this subchronic dietary study.","1001":"A simple method for the determination of sucralose in various foods using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) was developed. Sucralose was extracted with water or methanol, and the extract was cleaned up on a C18 cartridge, and diluted with water for injection into the LC\/MS\/MS. The LC separation was performed with a reversed-phase gradient on an ODS column, and the mass spectral acquisition was done in the negative ion mode by applying selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The recoveries of sucralose from various kinds of foods fortified at 100 micrograms\/g and 5 micrograms\/g were 88.1-96.7% and 92.7-98.5%, respectively. The lower limits of quantification were 0.5 microgram\/g in beverage, low-malt beer, yogurt and chocolate and 2.5 micrograms\/g in other foods. Forty-three commercial foods containing sucralose were analyzed by this method. Sucralose was detected in all samples at levels of 3.8-481 micrograms\/g.","1002":"","1003":"","1004":"","1005":"","1006":"","1007":"","1008":"","1009":"","1010":"","1011":"","1012":"Infants, whose growth and development are highly dependent upon the endocrine system, are particularly vulnerable to endocrine disruptor exposure. In our study, we examined whether or not alkylphenols, bisphenol A, benzophenone, di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate and 10 phthalates are present in containers of baby food. Furthermore, the migration into food-simulating solvents was also examined. Sixteen types of containers of baby food, obtained on the Japanese market in 2001, were examined: 8 glass bottle types, 1 plastic type, 1 metallic package (laminated with plastic) and 6 multilayered laminated film packages. Alkylphenols, benzophenone, bisphenol A and di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate were not detected in any of the samples. On the other hand, dibutylphthalate (DBP) was detected in 7 samples (1.2-9.1 micrograms\/sample), and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) was detected in 15 samples (1.3-18 micrograms\/sample). Migration tests were carried out for 5 samples, and the levels of DBP and DEHP that migrated into n-heptane were 0.68-1.7 micrograms\/sample and 0.33-3.5 micrograms\/sample, respectively. From these results, a baby's intake levels of DBP and DEHP were estimated to be about 1\/2,500 and 1\/90-300 of the tolerable daily intake (TDI), respectively.","1013":"Three samples of polyvinyl chloride products for food use were examined for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) migration levels under the conditions described in the Japanese Food Sanitation Law. These samples were two kinds of tubes and one stretched film, containing 12 to 41% DEHP by weight. DEHP migration levels from them were very low, all below 0.1 ppm, into 3 kinds of food simulant; water, 4% acetic acid and 20% ethanol. However, high levels of DEHP migrated into n-heptane, 12 ppm from the stretched film sample and more than 800 ppm from the tube samples. Migration from the 2 tubes was higher than 150 ppm, the limit of residues after evaporation in containers and wraps. Though the limit of residues after evaporation is not set for equipment used in the preparation of foods, the tested tubes were considered to be unsuitable for uses in which they come into direct contact with oils, fats or oily foods.","1014":"The main and minor constituents of tenryocha extract product, a natural sweetener, were investigated as a part of an ongoing study to evaluate its quality and safety as a food additive. Four constituents, namely rubusoside, steviolmonoside, panicloside IV, and ent-16 alpha, 17-dihydroxykauran-19-oic acid, were isolated. The concentration of rubusoside, the main sweet constituent, was 8.65% in the tenryocha extract product. In addition, it was confirmed that the origin of the extract was the leaves of Rubus suavissimus S. Lee (Rosaseae), as determined by comparing TLC and HPLC profiles of the product and hot-water extract prepared from the leaves of R. suavissimus.","1015":"In order to evaluate the relationship between nasal carriers of S. aureus and their history of allergic diseases, the total serum IgE titer, the hemogramme pattern, and the titers of specific IgE antibody to Staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B (SEA and SEB) and of specific IgG antibody to SEB were investigated in 98 trade school students. Fifteen (15.3%) of the 98 students were sensitized to SEA and\/or SEB (40.0% to SEA and 93.3% to SEB). In this group, 11 subjects were S. aureus carriers (73.0%) and 12 had a history of allergic diseases (80.0%). Low levels of specific IgG antibody to SEB were identified from both S. aureus carriers and non-carriers. The S. aureus carriers had significantly higher levels of total IgE titer than the non-carriers and the individuals with a history of allergic diseases had significantly higher total IgE titer levels than those having no history of allergic diseases (p &lt; 0.01). In the hemogramme patterns of S. aureus carriers, a significant positive correlation was observed between the total IgE antibodies and the eosinophil rate (p &lt; 0.05), and a negative correlation (p &lt; 0.001) was recognized between the neutrophil and the lymphocyte rates.","1016":"The efficacy of Baird-Parker (BP) agar, mannitol-salt-egg yolk (MSEY) agar and mannitol salt (MS) agar in detecting Staphylococcus aureus FRI-100 heated at 52 degrees C for 20 min in 100 mmol\/L potassium phosphate buffer was determined. Brain heart infusion agar with 1% pyruvate (BHIP agar) supported the highest recovery of injured cells and was used as the control medium. Of the three selective media, significantly higher recovery of heat-injured cells was observed on BP agar than MSEY agar, and the poorest recovery was observed on MS agar (p &lt; 0.05). Low recovery of unheated cells was obtained for MS compared with other media (p &lt; 0.05). A reduction in populations occurred gradually in reagent-grade water stored for 14 days at -20 degrees C. There was no significant difference between BHIP agar and MS agar in the number of freeze-injured cells recovered from 1 to 14 days.","1017":"A simple and reliable method using liquid chromatography\/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC\/ESI-MS) for the analysis of tetrodotoxin in puffer-fish was developed. Tetrodotoxin in puffer-fish was extracted with 0.1% acetic acid by heating in a boiling water bath, and the extracts were cleaned up on a Bond Elut C18 (500 mg) cartridge. The LC separation was performed on a TSK-gel ODS 80Ts column (25 cm x 2 mm i.d.) using 5 mmol\/L heptafluoro-n-butyric acid (HFBA)-methanol (99:1) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL\/min. Positive ionization produced a typical [M + H]+ molecular ion of tetrodotoxin (m\/z 320.1). The calibration graph for tetrodotoxin was rectilinear from 0.1 to 1 microgram\/mL with selected ion monitoring (SIM). The detection limit of tetrodotoxin in puffer-fish was 1 microgram\/g (equivalent to ca. 5 MU\/g).","1018":"A highly sensitive HPLC with fluorescence detection was developed for the determination of free fatty acids (FFAs) in milk and dairy products. For this purpose, the FFAs were extracted from small amounts of milk (1.0 mL), cheese (0.5 g) and butter (0.5 g) using Sep-Pak cartridge columns, and then derivatized to 9-anthrylmethyl esters with 9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM). Good separations of the ADAM derivatives of 16 FFAs (C4-C18) that exist in milk, cheese and butter, which permitted quantitative estimation of their individual FFAs, were achieved by HPLC on a C18 column (Cadenza CD-C18, 150 x 3 mm i.d.) using gradient elution with methanol and water. The acid values calculated from the contents of individual FFAs were in good agreement with those obtained by the conventional titration method. These results demonstrate that the present HPLC method is simple, sensitive and precise, and could be utilized widely for determination of the FFAs in milk and dairy products.","1019":"A method was developed for analysis of thyroid hormones, 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4), in health foods by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC\/ESI-MS). In order to release T3 and T4 from thyroglobulin, samples were first hydrolyzed enzymatically using protease at a temperature of 37 +\/- 1 degrees C for 28 h. The T3 and T4 were extracted with ethyl acetate and then the ethyl acetate layer was evaporated. The residue was dissolved in the mobile phase and analyzed by LC\/MS. The LC separation was carried out on a ODS-3 column (2.1 x 150 mm) using H2O\/CH3CN\/CH3COOH (650\/350\/5) as the mobile phase. LC\/ESI-MS was performed in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode using [M + H]+ ions at m\/z 652 for T3 and m\/z 778 for T4. The detection limit of both T3 and T4 released from thyroglobulin was 0.1 microgram\/g in health foods. The present method was applied to analysis of three health foods which were labeled as foods for dieting. T3 and T4 were detected in two of the samples, and their contents were 16 and 29 micrograms\/g and 31 and 90 micrograms\/g, respectively.","1020":"An effective clean-up procedure was developed to determine trace levels of bromate in bread by high-performance liquid chromatography with post-column flow reactor detection. Bromate was extracted from bread with deionized pure water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through a paper filter. The filtrate was filtered through a 0.2 micron nylon filter and chloride ion was removed by an IC-SP M Ag cartridge column or On-Guard Ag cartridge column. The eluate was applied to an Oasis MAX anion exchange cartridge column. The column was washed with 20% acetic acid and water. Bromate was then eluted with 0.5% sodium nitrate solution. The eluate was determined by HPLC with post column flow reactor detection. The method had a quantitation limit of 2 ng\/g in bread products. Recoveries of bromate from bread ranged from 68 to 72% at a spiked bromate level of 2-10 ng\/g.","1021":"The use of polyvinyl chloride gloves containing di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate for food contact applications is restricted. In their place, polyvinyl chloride gloves containing non-phthalate plasticizers (PVC-NP) have been introduced. They contained unknown substances, so they were studied by GC\/MS, HR-MS and NMR. The chemical structures of the unknown substances were confirmed to be diethylene glycol dibenzoate, triethylene glycol dibenzoate, dipropylene glycol dibenzoate, and alkylsulfonic acid phenyl ester, which are plasticizers. Including di-isononyl adipate, the contents of the plasticizers were 37.5-48.9% in the PVC-NP gloves, and their migration levels were 1,010-1,390 ppm into n-heptane. These are very high levels. These plasticizers are not widely used for food contact polyvinyl chloride throughout the world, and they have also not been registered as self-standards by Japanese manufacturers. Careful consideration will be necessary for the selection of a suitable plasticizer substitute.","1022":"A simultaneous determination method for 9 organotin compounds in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and silicone products used as kitchen utensils and food packages was developed using ethyl derivatization with sodium tetraethylborate (NaBEt4). Organotin compounds were extracted with acetone-hexane (3:7) from the samples after acidification and the extract was filtered and concentrated at under 40 degrees C. After centrifugal separation, these compounds were derivatized with 2% NaBEt4 solution and determined by GC\/MS. This method was applicable for simple routine analysis. Recoveries of spiked compounds were 49.1-118.1% for 3 PVC products and 88.8-102.2% for a siliconized paper. Monooctyltin, dioctyltin and trioctyltin compounds were found in all PVC food containers at the levels of 123-1,380 micrograms\/g, 1,770-13,200 micrograms\/g and 6.6-139 micrograms\/g, respectively. They also were found in 3 gloves, 5 spouts, 1 hose and 5 pipes. Some PVC products contained monomethyltin, dimethyltin, trimethyltin, monobutyltin and dibutyltin compounds at the levels of 97.3-433 micrograms\/g, 96.5-5,120 micrograms\/g, 8.5-24.9 micrograms\/g, 1.2-852 micrograms\/g and 1.2-29.4 micrograms\/g, respectively.","1023":"A rapid and clean method for the analysis of aflatoxins (AFs) was developed by using a new column and post-column photochemical derivatization HPLC with fluorescence detection. The new cleanup column consisted of magnesia and basic alumina poured on the top of a commercial multi-functional mini-column. It was extremely effective for the cleanup of AFs from raw peanut, corn, buckwheat and red pepper. Fluorescent substances, which interfered with the analysis of AFs from corn, were completely absorbed at the top of the magnesia layer. Recoveries of AFs (B1, B2, G1, G2) added to raw peanuts, corn, buckwheat and red pepper were over 80% at two levels of fortification (higher level: 10, 3, 10, 3 ng\/g, respectively, lower level: 1.0, 0.3, 1.0, 0.3 ng\/g, respectively). Coefficients of variation were smaller than 12%, except the lower fortified level for red pepper. Limits of detection for AFs in raw peanuts, corn and buckwheat were 0.3 ng\/g for B1 and G1, and 0.1 ng\/g for B2 and G2. Those in red pepper were 0.5 ng\/g for B1, B2, G1 and G2.","1024":"We studied a gas chromatographic method for the determination of dichlorvos (DDVP) and trichlorfon (DEP) in agricultural products. DDVP and DEP were extracted from agricultural products with acetone and re-extracted with ethyl acetate instead of dichloromethane. DDVP and DEP were eluted in one fraction on a silica gel column using n-hexane-acetone (1:1). DEP is a thermally labile compound, so it was derived to a more thermally stable compound by acylation with N-methylbis(trifluoroacetamide) and pyridine in acetone at 60 degrees C for 2 hours. DDVP and the DEP-TFA derivative were determined simultaneously by GC-FPD. The recoveries of DDVP and DEP from agricultural products spiked at levels of 0.1 microgram\/g were 72.6-117.7% and 86.2-106.6%, respectively. The detection limits were 0.03 microgram\/g in powdered tea and &lt; or = 0.01 microgram\/g in other samples. An interlaboratory study by 6 laboratories was conducted to validate this proposed method for 6 crops. Repeatability ranged from 3.1 to 7.8% for DDVP and from 3.4 to 8.3% for DEP, and reproducibility, from 6.9 to 15.5% for DDVP, and from 7.9 to 21.8% for DEP. Precision values were well within statistically predicted levels.","1025":"An unknown red pigment was purified from an apple syrup product imported from Canada, using a DIAION HP-20 column with methanol as the eluent. By spectroscopic means and chemical synthesis, the isolated pigment was identified as 4-aminocarminic acid, which is the major pigment of acid-stable carmine (a red colorant illegal in Japan). In addition, HPLC and TLC methods were proposed to detect this illegal colorant. While the color of carminic acid changed from yellow to red in the pH range of McIlvaine buffer (3.0-7.0), the color of 4-aminocarminic acid was always red, and also the ultraviolet\/visible (UV\/Vis) spectra did not change. These characteristics are useful to distinguish 4-aminocarminic acid from carminic acid.","1026":"","1027":"","1028":"","1029":"","1030":"The levels of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEPHP), di-isononyl phthalate (DINP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) and di-isononyl adipate (DINA) were determined in 50 processed foods (ham and sausage, fried dumpling and shao-mai, fish paste products, croquette and fried fish, bread, noodle, pickles, etc.). DBP, BBP, DEHP, DINP, DEHA, and DINA were contained at nd approximately 47.7, nd approximately 16.6, nd approximately 749, nd approximately 358, nd approximately 57.2 and nd approximately 20,200 ppb, respectively. High-level contamination of DINA was found in fish paste products, croquette and shao-mai, presumably because of migration from plasticized wrapping film using for food packaging. We studied the relationship between DINA migration from wrapped PVC film into fried croquette and its standing time after frying. When the croquette was wrapped immediately after frying, the migration from wrapping film into the croquette was highest (36,400 ng\/g). On wrapping after standing for 5 min and 30 min, the migration level was reduced to 1\/3.5 and 1\/14 of the highest level, respectively.","1031":"Basal studies for the confirmation of sanitary rules in the kitchen were performed, focusing on preventing an outbreak of food poisoning due to eggs contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis (SE), using hen and quail eggs. SE did not grow at 5 degrees C but grew markedly at 25 degrees C in eggs. The invasion and growth of SE were marked under very humid conditions regardless of whether the eggshell was damaged. The invasion of SE into egg also occurred when eggs were taken in and out of the refrigerator. Moreover, SE was spread immediately to all non-contaminated eggs when SE-contaminated eggs were cracked into a bowl with non-contaminated eggs. In homemade mayonnaise containing 15% vinegar, sterilization took several hours to occur. On a stainless-steel bowl, SE survived for 2 weeks or more. These findings suggest that it is necessary to pay attention to secondary contamination.","1032":"We developed a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect prion protein contained in materials derived from cattle, aiming at establishing a method to detect abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) in food products. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against bovine prion peptides. Using these antibodies, we have established a competitive ELISA that is capable of detecting recombinant bovine prion protein (rBoPrP) in the range of 12 to 1,200 ng and we used it to determine prion protein contents in bovine cerebral cortex. This assay system was evaluated by spiking food products with various amounts of rBoPrP. The determination gave 2-fold higher values in minced meat homogenates and lower values in large intestine homogenates than the values expected from the spiked amounts. This assay provides a simple determination method of spiked rBoPrP, and therefore is expected to be useful for investigating sample pretreatment methods.","1033":"A rapid analytical method for residues of the herbicide glufosinate [DL-homoalanin-4-yl (methyl)phosphinic acid] and its metabolite (MPPA: 3-methylphosphinicopropionic acid) in soybeans and corns was developed by improving the bulletin method. Fifty mL of solution extracted with water (corresponding to 2 g of the sample) was loaded on a column packed with 5 mL of anion exchange resin, and then the trapped glufosinate and MPPA were eluted with 40 mL of 50% acetic acid. After the derivatization of glufosinate and MPPA with trimethyl orthoacetate, the derivatives were purified and separated on a silica gel cartridge column. The determination of the derivatives was performed with a GC-FPD. The detection limits for glufosinate and MPPA were 0.01 microgram\/g and 0.005 microgram\/g, respectively. The recoveries of glufosinate from soybeans and corns were 86.3-92.0%, and those of MPPA were 86.5-95.2%.","1034":"A simple and convenient method for colorimetric determination of sulfite in foods based on its conversion to formaldehyde with sulfite oxidase and catalase was developed. Sulfite in a sample was extracted with water and then diluted with methanol. One mL of sample solution containing about 5-10 micrograms of sulfite was taken into a test tube with a ground-glass stopper, and 3 mL of 0.04 mol\/L borate buffer (pH 8.7), 1 mL of 0.4% 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) solution, 2,000 units of catalase solution and 1.0 units of sulfite oxidase were added. The mixture was incubated for 35 minutes at 37 degrees C. Then 0.15 mL of 1 mol\/L hydrochloric acid and 5 mL of 0.2% iron(III) nitrate solution were added. The reaction mixture was transferred to a measuring flask after standing for 5 minutes at room temperature, and diluted to 20 mL with methanol. The absorbance of this solution was measured using a spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 635 nm. The calibration curve prepared with sodium sulfite showed linearity between 0 to 16 micrograms\/mL as sulfur dioxide. The recoveries of sulfite in \"Kanpyo\" (dried gourd shavings) and \"Konnyaku-seiko\" (devil's-tongue fine powder) by the proposed method were 97-104%, and the coefficients of variation were below 6%. The sulfite values in these foods determined by the proposed method were reasonably consistent with those obtained by the bubbling distillation-alkaline titration method.","1035":"Production of volatile substances from edible oils and their constituents by Penicillium corylophilum was studied to clarify the mechanism of flavor production from a non-stick oil by the organism in a rice cake system. First, edible oils from plant and animal origins were tested for flavor production. Among the oils tested, coconut oil was the only one from which the flavor was produced. Second, triacylglycerols consisting of fatty acids with various lengths of carbon chain (C6 to C13) were studied for flavor production. Among the triacylglycerols tested, flavors were produced from those consisting of fatty acids with carbon chains of C6 to C11. The flavors consisted of methylketones and secondary alcohols, whose carbon chains were one carbon shorter than the precursor fatty acid molecules of the triacylglycerols. Flavors similar to that from the non-stick oil were produced from tricaprylin (C8), trinonanoin (C9), and tridecanoin (C10) among the triacylglycerols tested. Formation of mould spores was more strongly suppressed by triacylglycerols with shorter chain fatty acids. Third, fatty acids with various lengths of carbon chain (C7 to C15) were studied for flavor production. Among the fatty acids tested, flavors were produced from decanoic (C10) and undecanoic (C11) acids only. The flavors also consisted of methylketones and secondary alcohols one carbon shorter than the precursor fatty acids. Fatty acids with short carbon chains (C7 to C9) completely inhibited the mould growth. Our study showed that the range of carbon chain length of fatty acids capable of the flavor production (C10 to C11) was narrower than that of triacylglycerols (C6 to C11). It was also found that the non-stick oil and coconut oil contain tricaprylin and tridecanoin as triacylglycerols and decanoic acid as fatty acid.","1036":"New estimation methods of bacterial cell concentration in samples by measurement of the increase in bacterial adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) content during incubation using a conventional firefly luminometer were established. When an Escherichia coli cell suspension was incubated in nutrient broth, the increase in the ATP content of the suspension during the incubation period followed a sigmoidal curve. The increase ratio of the ATP content of the suspension at a given period of incubation (5 hours in this study) to the initial ATP content was greater at higher initial cell concentrations. With this relationship, the initial cell concentration of a test suspension could be predicted from the measured ratio; this was called the end point method. On the other hand, the lag period in the ATP increase curve was longer at lower initial cell concentrations. A highly linear relationship was observed between the lag period and the logarithm of the initial cell concentrations. Based on this relationship, a delay method was developed for prediction. The two relationships were also observed for bacterial suspensions of Klebsiella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas sp. These results suggested that the two methods have the potential to estimate the bacterial cell concentration of a sample suspension.","1037":"A subchronic toxicity study on kooroo color was conducted using F344 rats of both genders. Kooroo color is an extract of yam root, Dioscorea matudai Hayata, of which the major components are known to be flavonoid pigments. Use of kooroo as a food color is permitted by the Food Sanitation Law in Japan, but the chronic toxicity has not been evaluated in the literature. Rats were fed the product of kooroo color (PKC) at doses of 0.5%, 1.50%, and 5.0% in basal powder diet, while control groups received PKC-free basal diet, for ninety days. A vehicle control given propylene glycol (PG) alone, at the same dosage that the 5.0% group received, was included, because PKC used in this study contained ca. 80 percent PG, used as an extractant during the manufacturing processes. Daily observation of general behavior, and weekly measurement of body weight as well as food consumption were performed. Hematological, serum biochemical and anatomopathological examinations were conducted at the end of administration. No abnormalities ascribable to the treatment with PKC or PG were noted in any examination in this study. Hence, dietary intake of 5.0% of PKC, i.e., 2,993 mg\/kg\/day for males, and 3,376 mg\/kg\/day for females, as a mean daily intake for 90 days, had no observable adverse effect in F344 rats. Therefore, kooroo color has no significant general toxicity, and its toxicity, if any, is of a very low order.","1038":"A new ion-pairing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method on a C30 column with a volatile mobile phase was developed to separate the gonyautoxin group (GTXs) from contaminants, allowing the utilization of liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) with higher performance. A mobile phase consisting of 5 mmol\/L heptafluorobutyric acid and 2% acetonitrile in 10 mmol\/L ammonium acetate was adopted for separation of GTXs because the C30 column strongly retains GTXs under acidic conditions. The newly adopted method could efficiently separate GTXs from contaminants, especially in the toxic short-necked clam, whereas the routine HPLC so far used has poor resolution to separate GTXs from unknown interfering substances. In our method, GTXs were eluted in the order of GTX5, GTX3, GTX4, GTX2 and GTX1 from the C30 column, and were successfully determined by sonic spray ionization mass spectrometry (SSI-MS) with high sensitivity. This method is characterized by the combination of HPLC using a fluorescence detection system for PSP, and SSI-MS for measurement of the mass number.","1039":"We investigated the determination of N-methylcarbamate pesticides and their metabolites in agricultural products by HPLC with post-column fluorescence detection after clean-up with an SPE cartridge. The homogenate of agricultural products was extracted with acetone. The crude extract was partitioned between 5% sodium chloride solution and dichloromethane, and the dichloromethane layer was concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved with a mixture of acetone and n-hexane, and purified by using Supelclean ENVI-Carb SPE, Bond Elut Extraction Cartridge PSA and SAX in series with a mixture of acetone and n-hexane. N-Methylcarbamate pesticide was analyzed by HPLC with post-column reaction and fluoresce detection. N-Methylcarbamate pesticide in citrus fruits and various kinds of agricultural products could be analyzed accurately by the presented method. Recoveries of N-methylcarbamate pesticides added to several agricultural products at the level of 0.10 ppm were mostly in the range of 60-110%. The limit of detection was 0.005 ppm.","1040":"A dual-column GC system equipped with MS and ECD, using two identical columns (HP-1701), one connected to the MS and one to the ECD, has been developed. The carrier gas flow rate was adjusted to give the same retention time of each peak in both columns. Unknown peaks were detected and identified in 7 samples of crops using this system. It was confirmed that the unknown peaks were 5 pesticides, i.e., bromopropylate and others. The recoveries and CV of bromopropylate from spinach and Komatsuna were good. The results of determination of bromopropylate by both MS and ECD were the same. Unknown chemicals can be easily identified using GC equipped with MS and ECD, and this system should be useful in the field of food hygiene.","1041":"The contents of barbaloin (BA), isoBA, aloin-dimers A, B, C, D and aloe-emodin (AE) in aloe drinks were investigated. BA and isoBA were detected in 30 of the 31 samples at the levels of 120-570 micrograms\/mL and 120-580 micrograms\/mL, respectively. Aloin-dimers A, B, C and D were detected in 8 of the 31 samples at the levels of 12-38 micrograms\/mL, 13-39 micrograms\/mL, 11-36 micrograms\/mL and 16-69 micrograms\/mL, respectively. AE was detected in all of the 31 samples at the levels of 0.03-1.3 micrograms\/mL. When aloe drinks were stored for 4 weeks at 5 degrees C after opening the bottle, decrease of BA and isoBA, and increase of AE and aloin-dimers A, B, C and D were observed in most cases. However, in a few aloe drinks, all of BA, isoBA, aloin-dimers A, B, C, D and AE decreased. In these drinks, the existence of aloin-trimer was elucidated by LC\/MS analyses. These data suggested that BA in aloe drinks is converted to the dimer and then to the trimer during storage.","1042":"Four kinds of barbaloin (BA)-related compounds (A, B, C, D) in aloe drinks were isolated by using preparative HPLC. LC\/MS analyses of these compounds showed the identical quasimolecular ion peak at m\/z 833 [M-H]-. The chemical structures were mainly determined by NMR, including 1H-1H two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (COSY), nuclear Overhauser and exchange spectroscopy (NOESY), heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple-bond connectivity (HMBC) experiments. They were identified as BA-related compounds A (10R, 10\"S), B (10S, 10\"S), C (10S, 10\"R), and D (10R, 10\"R) coupled through a C-10 to C-7' linkage, and newly found in nature. These results suggested that BA is converted to dimers during storage of aloe drinks.","1043":"","1044":"","1045":"","1046":"","1047":"A liquid chromatographic (LC) method with diode array detection (DAD) was developed for screening of 10 sulfonyl urea herbicide residues in unpolished rice. The investigated herbicides were azimsulfuron, bensulfuron-methyl, chlorimuron-ethyl, chlorsulfuron, ethoxysulfuron, flazasulfuron, imazosulfuron, metsulfuron-methyl, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl and tribenuron-methyl. Acetonitrile-water (2:1) extracts of rice samples were cleaned up with solid-phase extraction cartridges (octadecylsilane-bonded silica (ODS) and graphitized carbon black (GCB)). Three fractions of the GCB eluate were taken for analysis using 3 separate injections in order to avoid interference in LC-DAD analysis and to reduce analyte coelution problems. Recoveries from rice samples fortified with the 10 herbicides at 0.05 and 0.2 microgram\/g ranged from 46.6 to 119.6%, and coefficients of variation were 3.1-12.6%. The quantitation limits were 0.01-0.02 microgram\/g.","1048":"A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the simultaneous analysis of triamterene, trichlormethiazide, furosemide and spironolactone is presented for application in the examination of health food supplements advertising weight reduction and in the analysis of pharmaceuticals. The HPLC assay was performed under gradient conditions using a Wakosil ODS 5C18 column (5 microns, 150 x 4.6 mm i.d.). The mobile phase consisted of a gradient program with a mixture of water and acetonitrile containing 0.1% triethylamine adjusted with phosphoric acid to pH 3.0: from 0 to 6 min, 15% acetonitrile; from 6 to 20 min, linear gradient from 15 to 50% acetonitrile; and from 20 to 40 min, 50% acetonitrile. The column effluent was monitored from 0 to 20 min at 260 nm and from 20 to 40 min at 235 nm. The calibration curves of the four drugs showed good linearity and the correlation coefficients were better than 0.999 in all cases. The lower limits of detection were approximately 40 ng for each drug. Commercially available health food supplements and pharmaceuticals were analyzed after extraction with a mixture of methanol and acetic acid (99:1). The procedure described here is suitable for the screening of four diuretic drugs in adulterated supplements and for the quality control of pharmaceuticals with minimal sample preparation.","1049":"The survival of Vibrio parahaemolyticus serovar O3:K6 strains and other serovars in the presence of acetic, citric and hydrochloric acids were studied. There were no differences in resistance to these acids between serovar O3:K6 and the other serovars. At pH 5.6, citric acid was more effective in reducing the number of viable cells of V. parahaemolyticus than acetic acid. However, at pH 4.5, acetic acid was more effective than citric acid. The number of viable cells decreased quickly in the presence of rice vinegar or wine vinegar at pH 4.0.","1050":"We investigated simultaneous analytical methods for pesticide residues in large numbers of agricultural products samples. Extraction of each sample with acetonitrile was followed by a salting-out step using a graduated cylinder. The test solution was cleaned up with gel permeation chromatography (GPC), which separated the pesticide eluate into 2 fractions, and then with a tandem mini-column. Analysis was done with a dual-column GC equipped with a dual NPD and FPD (S mode) detector. Use of the Siltek-deactivated liner, guard column, and Y connector, and Silcosteel-treated NPD jet was effective for preventing the breakdown of sulfur-containing pesticides. Recoveries of 87 nitrogen-containing and sulfur-containing pesticides from fortified spinach, tomato, apple, strawberry and brown rice, ranged from 71 to 127% with RSD values of 1-24%, except for recoveries of aldicarb, amitraz, ethiofencarb, imazalil, propamocarb and triflumizole. Detection limits of pesticides were very good (0.3-5 ppb (NPD) and 2-20 ppb (FPD)) for routine analysis of pesticide residues in foods. Surveillance of pesticides in agricultural products was carried out by using the present method. From 22 out of 33 samples, 21 pesticides (43 in total) were detected. The results indicated that the present method can be applied as an efficient and reliable means for monitoring pesticide residues in agricultural products.","1051":"PCR detection of genetically modified (GM) line-specific recombinant DNA was carried out on Bt 11, Event 176 and Non-GM maize grain harvested in 1999. Of 100 grains of Bt 11 line, Event 176 specific DNA was detected in 11 grains. Of 30 grains of Event 176 line, Mon 810 or Bt 11 specific DNA was detected in 5 grains. In addition, Bt 11 or Event 176 specific DNA was detected in 4 of 30 Non-GM grains. These data suggest that maize grains (not seed) often contain DNAs of different lines from what they were expected to contain. Furthermore, quantitative PCR was performed to estimate the genotype of the Event 176 grains described above. The results showed that the genotype of all the grains containing different recombinant DNA is heterozygous. Therefore, it was considered that the grains containing the unintended recombinant DNA were not accidental contaminants, but that airborne pollination had introduced the recombinant DNA into the grains.","1052":"We performed experiments on in vitro digestion of newly expressed proteins by SGF (simulated gastric fluid) and SIF (simulated intestinal fluid) to assess the allergenicity of food components derived from biotechnological modification. For newly expressed proteins, we chose CP4-EPSPS (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4) and Cry1Ab derived from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain HD-1. The former is expressed in GM-soybeans and the latter is expressed in GM-corns. Firstly, we examined the digestibility of purified CP4-EPSPS and Cry1Ab by SGF. Both proteins were rapidly digested within 60 sec. After preheating, the digestibility by SGF was slightly increased. Secondly, CP4-EPSPS in GM-soybean extracts and Cry1Ab in GM-corn extracts were digested by SGF. The digestion time of both proteins by SGF was almost the same as that of the purified proteins. Thirdly, the digestibility of CP4-EPSPS and Cry1Ab by SIF was examined. The digestion time of these proteins was 240 min or more. However, digestibility of these proteins by SIF was dramatically increased by preheating, and the digestion time was less than 5 sec. Fourthly, CP4-EPSPS in GM-soybean extracts and Cry1Ab in GM-corn extracts were digested by SIF. Digestion time of both proteins by SIF was almost the same as that of the purified proteins. From these results, we concluded that the digestibility of both CP4-EPSPS and Cry1Ab by SGF and SIF was increased by preheating. Therefore, we suggest that the allergenicity of both proteins should be extremely low because of the easy digestibility of these proteins by SGF and also by SIF with preheating.","1053":"Tissue distribution and residue depletion of oxytetracycline (OTC) and oxolinic acid (OA) were studied in the kuruma prawn (Penaeus japonicus). The prawn were kept in tanks with recirculated artificial seawater at a salinity of 22-23@1000. The water temperature was maintained at 25 degrees C. The average body weight was 22.9 +\/- 4.9 g for OTC and 22.5 +\/- 3.6 g for OA. The drug was mixed with the diet and orally administered through a catheter to the prawn. The doses of OTC and OA, respectively, were 50 mg\/kg body weight. At each sample time, four prawns were sacrificed and tissues were sampled. OTC and OA levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. At the highest levels, the concentrations of OTC were in the other: shell (13.57 micrograms\/g) &gt; hemolymph (12.20 micrograms\/mL) &gt; muscle (8.30 micrograms\/g). For OA, the order was: shell (20.74 micrograms\/g) &gt; hemolymph (7.06 micrograms\/mL) &gt; muscle (2.05 micrograms\/g). The elimination half-lives of hemolymph and muscle were 44.7 and 46.8 hours for OTC and 55.0 and 107.9 hours for OA, respectively. Residual OTC could not be detected in hemolymph and muscle at 20 days after dosing. Residual OA disappeared from hemolymph and muscle at 25 days after dosing. A 25-day period for OTC and 30-day period for OA could be regarded as the proper withdrawal time established for kuruma prawn by the Pharmaceutical Law in Japan. However, the elimination half-lives of shell for OTC and OA could not be calculated because both drug residues persisted in shell tissues, and the elimination phase was not completed during the experimental period. Residual OTC (14.10 +\/- 2.26 micrograms\/g, n = 6) and OA (0.32 +\/- 0.06 microgram\/g, n = 7) were detected in exuviae at 3 days and 4 days after dosing, respectively. Residual OTC was reduced to 50-70% in muscle by the usual methods of cooking (boiling, baking at 200 degrees C and frying at 180 degrees C), whereas reduction levels in shell were only 20-30%. Residual OA was reduced to 20-30% in muscle and shell by the cooking. These results confirm that the cooking procedures could only reduce but not completely eliminate these drug residues in prawn.","1054":"The daily intake of nitrate and nitrite in school children (n = 100) in Hiroshima Prefecture was estimated directly by the duplicate portion method. The daily intake of nitrate was 68.42 +\/- 77.49 mg. The daily intake of nitrate\/kg body weight was 2.06 +\/- 2.24 mg, which is about 56% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The daily intake of nitrite was 0.953 +\/- 0.869 mg. The daily intake of nitrite\/kg body weight was 0.027 +\/- 0.021 mg, which is about 45% of the ADI. The daily intake of nitrite\/kg body weight was significantly different between the obese group and the non-obese group in boys (p &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test). The rates of children whose daily intakes of nitrate and nitrite were above the ADI were 16% and 7%, respectively.","1055":"An analytical method was developed for lac color in diets fed to rats and in the feces, and the contents of lac color were determined. After lac color was extracted with 0.05% sodium carbonate and 50% ethanol containing 0.02% sodium lauryl sulfate from the diets and feces, the extracted color solutions were analyzed by HPLC. The recoveries of lac color from diets spiked at 1.25, 5.00% and that from feces spiked at 5.00% were 85.6, 93.4% and 69.5%, respectively. Contents of lac color in diets prepared to contain 1.25 and 5.00% were 1.1 and 5.2%, and dose levels were confirmed by these results. Contents of lac color in feces of male and female rats given lac color were 127.8 mg\/g and 138.6 mg\/g, respectively. By comparing the HPLC chromatograms of laccaic acids in the diet with those in feces of rats, laccaic acid A, B, C and E were detected in both, and their content ratios were approximately determined.","1056":"An HPLC method with fluorescence detection was developed for the determination of propyl gallate, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole (2- and 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole), tert-butylhydroquinone and octyl gallate in edible oils and foods. The antioxidants in edible oil were isolated directly with acetonitrile saturated with n-hexane. The antioxidants in food were extracted with ethyl acetate and the extract was concentrated under vacuum. They were isolated from the residue with acetonitrile saturated with n-hexane. The acetonitrile layer was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min. The HPLC separation was performed on a Symmetry C18 column (3.5 microns, 4.6 mm i.d. x 150 mm) using a mixture of 5% acetic acid-acetonitrile-methanol (4:3:3, v\/v\/v) as the mobile phase and monitored by using a fluorescence detector with time programming. Sample peaks were identified by comparison of the fluorescence spectra with those of antioxidant standards. Average recoveries of fortified antioxidants at 100 micrograms\/g were 72.1-99.6%. Coefficients of variation were 0.7-7.2%.","1057":"","1058":"","1059":"","1060":"","1061":"A method is described for the determination of the anthelmintic levamisole in muscle, liver, kidney and fat of cattle, swine and poultry using high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. Levamisole was extracted from an alkaline sample with ethyl acetate and back-extracted with 0.1 mol\/L hydrochloric acid. The extract was applied to an SCX solid-phase extraction column. The column was washed with water and methanol. Levamisole was eluted with a solution of ammonia in methanol. The eluate was evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in the mobile phase and injected into the HPLC system. Mean recoveries from 0.01-0.10 microgram\/g fortified muscle, liver, kidney and fat samples ranged from 78.3 to 99.8%. The detection limit for the assay was 0.005 microgram\/g.","1062":"The mean concentrations and daily intake of four antifungal agents were estimated based on the results of an analysis of 7,005 samples of food obtained in official inspections by Japanese local governments in fiscal year 1998. The mean concentration of diphenyl was 0.0004% of the allowable limit, and those of imazalil, o-phenylphenol, and thiabendazole were 14.0%, 3.5%, and 5.7%, respectively. The daily intakes of these antifungal agents per person, estimated from their concentrations and the daily consumption of the foods, were 0.000326, 1.89, 11.5, and 23.3 micrograms, respectively, and assuming a body weight of 50 kg, the amounts of these antifungal agents consumed were 0.000013%, 0.15%, 0.12%, and 0.47% of the acceptable daily intake, respectively. These values are similar to the values obtained on the basis of the results of the official inspection in fiscal years 1994 and 1996, except that the amount of diphenyl is much lower (1\/100).","1063":"A simple and rapid method for spore rec-assay by utilizing dry sheet medium culture (Compactdry TC, CTC) for determining numbers of bacteria, instead of the spore agar plate, was developed. One mL of spore suspension (2 x 10(6)\/mL) of Bacillus subtilis strain M45 Rec- or H17 Rec+ was inoculated in the center of the CTC plate. In the case of metabolic activation, 1 mL of mixed solution (spore suspension of M45 or H17: 9,000 x g supernatant of rat-liver homogenate treated with Aroclor 1254 = 19:1) was used. The spore suspension spreads over the whole sheet in seconds and gels. A paper disk impregnated with 20-40 microL of the sample solution and 20 microL of the cofactor solution was placed on the surface of CTC plate. For the assay of samples that do not require metabolic activation, use of the cofactor solution can be omitted. After 48 hr incubation at 37 degrees C, 0.01% MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] aqueous solution (0.5 mL) was dropped uniformly on the plate. The plate was left for 5 min, and the diameter of the inhibition circle was measured with slide calipers. The samples for which the difference in inhibition zone between M45 and H17 was more than 2 mm were judged positive. Under these conditions, the DNA damaging activities of sodium sulfite, sodium benzoate and citric acid, used as food additives, were investigated by the proposed method. Sodium sulfite and sodium benzoate gave positive results and citric acid gave a negative result with or without metabolic activation, in agreement with the results obtained by the conventional method.","1064":"Determination of K-value (fish freshness index) and histamine (Hm) of mackerel and tuna during storage at various temperatures was done by using the oxygen-sensor method. Hm in mackerel increased even at low temperature (5 degrees C), and reached the Defect Action Level (DAL) of the U.S. FDA, 5 mg\/100 g, before the K-value approached the inedible level. As the storage temperature was increased, the rate of Hm formation increased remarkably and the amount of Hm in fish meat passed through the DAL, and reached the real hazard level, AL (50 mg\/100 g), in a short time. The initial Hm level of raw tuna was too low to determine by our oxygen-sensor method, and the final Hm level after 8 days' storage at under 5 degrees C was only 0.6 mg\/100 g. But, when the storage temperature was elevated, the rate of Hm formation increased rapidly, as in mackerel, and the Hm level reached the DAL, then the AL, in a short time. Simultaneous determination of K-value and Hm is recommended for accurate and reliable quality inspection of fish and fish products.","1065":"A simple method using Florisil cartridges was developed for the determination of dimethylformamide (DMF) in sucrose esters of fatty acids present in sugar esters (SuE) and sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB) used as food additives. SuE was dissolved in acetone and loaded on a Florisil cartridge. SAIB was dissolved in hexane, loaded on a Florisil cartridge and washed with 10% acetone in hexane. The columns were eluted with acetone and DMF in the eluates was determined by GC with an FID detector. Recoveries of DMF at the level of 0.5-100 micrograms\/g were 93.3-102.6%. The determination limit was 0.5 microgram\/g.","1066":"A method was developed for the analysis of ethychlozate (CIE) and its decomposition compound, 5-chloro-3(1H)-indazolylacetic acid (CIA) in fruits by HPLC and LC\/MS. The sample was homogenized with 1 mol\/L HC1, and CIE and CIA were extracted with 5 mol\/L HCl and acetone. They were extracted from the acetone extract with diethylether-n-hexane (2:1). CIE was hydrolyzed to CIA with methanol-4 mol\/L KOH (1:1). The solution was made acidic, and CIA was extracted with diethylether-n-hexane (2:1). The extract was cleaned up on a silica gel column. CIA was determined by HPLC-UV and LC\/MS (Scan or SIR). Four fruits were spiked with CIE or CIA at 0.5 microgram\/g and analyzed by the proposed method with HPLC. The average recoveries were 77.2-83.2% for CIE and 71.2-89.2% for CIA. The concentrations determined by LC\/MS were 10-25% higher than the values by HPLC. The limit of detection (LOD) of CIA standard solution by HPLC corresponds to 0.015 microgram\/g of CIE in the sample. In the same way, the LOD of CIA by LC\/MS (SIR) corresponds to 0.009 microgram\/g of CIE in the sample.","1067":"A detection method using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed to detect the genetically modified (GM) potato (NewLeaf Plus potato; NL-P), which has not been authorized as safe in foods in Japan. The potato sucrose synthase gene was used as an internal control. The DNA from NL-P specifically provided an amplified band using PCR with a primer pair recognizing PLRV-rep gene. In addition, to prevent false-positive results in processed potato foods infected with PLRV, we designed a primer pair recognizing sequences derived from two organisms to detect specifically NL-P in processed potato. The PCR product obtained using the designed primer pair was specific for NL-P. The DNA introduced into NL-P could be detected from potato powder samples containing 0.05% NL-P. The proposed method was applied to the detection of NL-P in 25 processed potato foods. NL-P was detected in 3 snack products.","1068":"Acid-stable carmine has recently been distributed in the U.S. market because of its good acid stability, but it is not permitted in Japan. We analyzed and determined the structure of the major pigment in acid-stable carmine, in order to establish an analytical method for it. Carminic acid was transformed into a different type of pigment, named acid-stable carmine, through amination when heated in ammonia solution. The features of the structure were clarified using a model compound, purpurin, in which the orientation of hydroxyl groups on the A ring of the anthraquinone skeleton is the same as that of carminic acid. By spectroscopic means and the synthesis of acid-stable carmine and purpurin derivatives, the structure of the major pigment in acid-stable carmine was established as 4-aminocarminic acid, a novel compound.","1069":"Amounts of isothiocyanates and related compounds in a mustard extract and a horseradish extract for food additive use were determined by GC, after confirmation of the identity of GC peaks by GC\/MS. Amounts of allyl isothiocyanate, which included that of allyl thiocyanate, because most of the allyl thiocyanate detected in the sample was assumed to have been formed from allyl isothiocyanate during GC analysis, were 97.6% and 85.4%, in the mustard extract and the horseradish extract, respectively. Total amounts of the identified isothiocyanates in the mustard extract and the horseradish extract were 98.5% and 95.4%, respectively. Allyl cyanide, a degradation product of allyl isothiocyanate, was found in the mustard extract and the horseradish extract at the levels of 0.57% and 1.73%, respectively. beta-Phenylethyl cyanide, a possible degradation product of beta-phenylethyl isothiocyanate, and allyl sulfides were found in the horseradish extract, at the levels of 0.13% and 0.46%, respectively. Allylamine, which is another degradation product of allyl isothiocyanate, was determined after acetylation, and was found in the mustard extract and the horseradish extract at the levels of 8 micrograms\/g and 67 micrograms\/g, respectively.","1070":"The mussel Mytilus edulis and the cultured ark shell Anadara broughtonii in the southeast coasts of the Seto Inland Sea were contaminated with paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) following the appearance of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamiyavanichii in early December 1999. A. tamiyavanichii plankton collected around the Straits of Naruto on December 3, 1999 showed PSP toxicity, of which 83 mol% was accounted for by GTX2, GTX3 and GTX4. Its specific toxicity was 112.5 fmol\/cell, and one MU was equivalent to 7,200 cells. Toxicity values at the beginning of toxification were 4.7 MU\/g for the ark shell and 7.3 MU\/g for the mussel. In the former, the value remained at almost 4 MU\/g, resulting in prohibition of marketing for about two months. In the latter, it sharply decreased to less than 4 MU\/g. These bivalves collected during the toxification period were dissected into five tissues, mantle, adductor muscle, hepatopancreas, gills and \"others\", and submitted to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The cultured ark shell accumulated GTX2, GTX3 and STX as major components and GTX1, GTX4, GTX5, neoSTX, dcSTX and PX1-3 (C1-C3) as minor ones. The amount of GTX3 decreased with time, while STX tended to increase. At the early stage of PSP toxification, toxins were accumulated in the gills and \"others\", most of which were quickly detoxified. On the other hand, PSP of the toxified mussel consisted of GTX4 as a main component, and GTX1, GTX2, GTX3, GTX5, STX and PX1-2 (C1-C2) as minor ones. Its toxin composition pattern was similar to that of the ingested causative plankton. Its total toxin decreased soon after disappearance of the dinoflagellate. During the decrease of toxicity, PSP tended to be retained in the hepatopancreas, resulting in accumulation of 50 mol% of total toxin.","1071":"","1072":"","1073":"","1074":"","1075":"","1076":"The mean concentration and daily intake of five preservatives were estimated based on the results of an analysis of 89,927 samples of food obtained in official inspections by Japanese local governments in fiscal year 1998.

Pesticide in the sample was extracted with methanol following liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate fraction was cleaned up with silica gel column chromatography. The eluate from the silica gel column was further cleaned up with SAX + PSA mini column, then determined by HPLC. Carotenoids and interfering peaks were removed by washing the combined mini columns with 10 mL of 20% acetone-containing n-hexane and 5 mL of acetone, and flusulfamide was eluted with 35 mL of acetone.","1078":"The occurrence of clostridia was investigated in a total of 60 commercially available curry roux samples. Clostridia were isolated from 37 (62%) samples, and Clostridium perfringens was isolated from 7 (12%) samples. The isolates of C. perfringens did not produce enterotoxin. The frequency of occurrence was higher by the enrichment broth culture detection method than by the agar plate or pouch method. These findings suggest that enrichment broth culture is necessary for the detection of clostridia.","1079":"We investigated simultaneous and consecutive analytical methods for pesticide residues in large numbers of vegetable and fruit samples. Extraction of the sample with acetonitrile was followed by a salting-out step using a graduated cylinder. Co-extractives were removed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and the pesticide eluate was separated to 2 fractions. Firstly, the second fraction (85-125 mL) was passed through a silica-gel mini-column. After putting a Florisil mini-column before the silica-gel mini-column, the first fraction (55-85 mL) was passed through the tandem mini-columns, which were then eluted with 15 mL of 50% acetone\/petroleum ether. The eluate was subjected to dual-column GC with dual FPD (P mode, column Rtx-OPPesticides) and NPD (column Rtx-200) detectors. Recoveries of 63 organophosphorus pesticides from fortified spinach, tomato, apple and strawberry, ranged from 71 to 126% with RSD values of 1-18%, except for the RSDs of omethoate, isoxathion, and pyraclofos (20% &lt;). Detection limits of pesticides were 0.5-2 ng\/g. Surveillance of pesticides in vegetables and fruits was carried out by using the present method. From 20 out of 30 samples, 15 pesticides (39 in total) were detected. The results indicated that the present method can be applied as an efficient and reliable tool for monitoring organophosphorus pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits.","1080":"The HPLC determination of organic impurities in Food Red No. 40 aluminum lakes (R-40Als) as directed by Japan's Specifications and Standards for Food Additives, 7th Ed. (JSFA-VII), has problems, such as reproducibility and low recovery. ICP analyses suggested that the problem was caused by the aluminum in the test solution. In the improved method for preparation of the test solution, aluminum was precipitated as a hydroxide gel by boiling with 1% aqueous ammonia. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for the HPLC analysis of the organic impurities in the lakes. Recoveries of organic impurities were more than 85% from R-40Al spiked at the 0.1 and 1.0% levels of R-40. The proposed method was also adapted for Food Yellow No. 5 aluminum lakes.","1081":"A sensitive and selective method using liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) for the determination of aminoglycoside antibiotics, streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin, in meat has been developed. The LC separation was performed on a TSK-gel Super ODS column (10 cm x 2 mm i.d.) using 5 mmol\/L heptafluoro-n-butyric acid (HFBA)-acetonitrile (88:12) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.18 mL\/min. The positive ionization produced typical [M + H]+ molecular ions of both drugs (streptomycin m\/z 582; dihydrostreptomycin m\/z 584). The calibration graphs for streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin were rectilinear from 0.25 to 25 ng with selected ion monitoring (SIM). The drugs were extracted with 1% metaphosphoric acid, and the extracts were added to 2 mL of 0.1 mol\/L heptanesulfonic acid. The solution was cleaned up on a Bond Elut C18 (500 mg) cartridge. The recoveries of streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin from swine and bovine muscle fortified at 0.2 microgram\/g were 73.2-82.6%, and the detection limits were 0.01 microgram\/g for both drugs.","1082":"We compared the carotenoid profile in GM papaya (Sunup) line to that of a non-GM one (Sunset). First, to identify major carotenoids in papaya, large-scale extraction was carried out with methanol. HPLC analyses of the methanol extracts revealed that both papayas mainly contained 5 pigments and no apparent difference was observed in the HPLC profiles. On the basis of LC\/MS data and photodiode-array spectra, beta-carotene (3), lycopene (2), beta-cryptoxanthin (1), and beta-cryptoxanthin myristoyl and lauroyl esters (4 and 5) were identified as major carotenoids. It is well known that most carotenoids are labile, so a rapid analysis with precautions to avoid decomposition was developed to quantify their contents in the original fruits. Frozen samples of the fruits were sliced and a piece (about 2 g) of fruit was cut out and lyophilized. After extraction of the piece with methanol containing an anti-oxidant, BHT, the extract was further partitioned with hexane and methanol. Finally the contents of the main carotenoids in the hexane fraction were analyzed by HPLC. The contents of total carotenoids (sum of 1-5) and beta-cryptoxanthin (1, 4 and 5) in GM papaya fruit were estimated to be 0.764 +\/- 0.056 and 0.604 +\/- 0.051 (mumol\/g), respectively and those in non-GM fruit were 0.883 +\/- 0.145 and 0.705 +\/- 0.098 (mumol\/g), respectively. These differences are not statistically significant.","1083":"An analytical method has been developed for the determination of 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenol (TTBP) in foods. TTBP was determined by GC\/MS (SIM) after extraction from food samples using a steam distillation technique. The developed method was able to determine simultaneously 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP), 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (2,6-DTBP), 3,5-di-tert-butylphenol (3,5-DTBP) and 2,4-di-tert-pentylphenol (2,4-DTPP). The method was applied to analyze the residues of the 5 phenolic compounds in 101 food samples purchased from markets. TTBP was found in some samples of meat, liver and fish (muscle) at the levels of trace (tr)-0.50 ng\/g, tr and tr-1.83 ng\/g, respectively. 2,4-DTBP was found in some samples of vegetables, meat, liver, fish (muscle) and fish (viscera) at the levels of 1.4-10.6 ng\/g, 2.7-26.4 ng\/g, tr-34.2 ng\/g, tr-21.6 ng\/g and tr, respectively. 2,6-DTBP was found in some samples of fish (muscle) and fish (viscera) at the levels of tr-3.9 ng\/g and tr, respectively. 3,5-DTBP and 2,4-DTPP were not found in any of the analyzed samples.","1084":"Samples of umeshu, a Japanese plum liqueur made from unripe plums, shochu and crystal sugar, were stored under fluorescent light, in the dark and in the refrigerator. The amount of ethyl carbamate formed in umeshu exposed to light or room temperature was larger than that in the dark or at low temperature. The amount of ethyl carbamate formed in umeshu to which cyanide had been added was larger than that in the absence of added cyanide. Thus, the amount of ethyl carbamate formed in the umeshu was increased by not only light and higher temperature, but also cyanide. Samples of model alcoholic beverages were stored under various conditions using red, yellow and blue cellophanes. The amount of ethyl carbamate formed in the model alcoholic beverage with blue cellophane was larger than in the cases of red and yellow cellophanes. It was found that the amount of ethyl carbamate formed in the model alcoholic beverage was increased by light in the wavelength range of 375-475 nm.","1085":"","1086":"","1087":"","1088":"","1089":"","1090":"","1091":"Between April 1996 to June 1998, 133 samples of 9 food commodities were analyzed for pesticide residues. In 8 samples of 5 commodities, 5 kinds of pesticides residues were detected. The baby foods in which the pesticides were detected were produced from vegetables and fruits. In our investigations, pesticide residues have been frequently detected in the raw materials. For the baby foods containing pesticides, intake amounts of the pesticides calculated from the daily feeding volume and the ADI were compared. Residual pesticide levels in baby food commodities are low, and it was concluded that they are not likely to present any problem in normal usage.","1092":"Method-performance studies were conducted for the notified revised analytical method of clofentezine. Clofentezine spiked in azuki beans, apple, orange, banana, grape, tea powder and tea extract at the level of 0.2 microgram\/g (2 micrograms\/g for tea) was analyzed in replicate in 6 laboratories. Mean values of recovery from 7 crops ranged from 78.4 to 85.2%. Repeatability relative standard deviation values ranged from 2.2 to 4.6% and reproducibility standard deviation values ranged from 4.8 to 10.3%. The detection limits were 0.005-0.01 microgram\/g. These results show the notified analytical method has good performance.","1093":"Method-performance studies were conducted for the notified revised analytical method of chinomethionat in agricultural products by interlaboratory study. Six laboratories analyzed unpolished rice, cabbage, squash, lettuce and orange spiked with 0.1 microgram\/g of chinomethionat in replicate. Mean values of recovery from the 5 crops ranged from 90.2 to 100.5%. Repeatability relative standard deviations ranged from 4.4 to 7.7% and reproducibility relative standard deviations ranged from 10.9 to 17.1%. The detection limits were 0.003-0.012 microgram\/g.","1094":"Method-performance studies were conducted for the notified revised analytical method of inabenfide in unpolished rice. Six laboratories analyzed unpolished rice spiked with 0.05 microgram\/g of inabenfide in replicate. Mean recovery from rice was 85.0%.

The detection limits were 0.002-0.01 microgram\/g.","1095":"Food hygiene in Japanese-style confectionery factories is hard to practice because the businesses are small. In a supporting system of voluntary-based hygienic management in this field, we microbiologically investigated the production processes of \"Monaka\" in a workshop in Tokyo. We microbiologically assessed the processing environments as well as the products in the workshop, then proposed some improvements in the production of the confectionery. After the improvements, microbial contamination of the processing environments was reduced and no microbial contamination was found in the sugared bean, or \"An\" produced, though the product \"Monaka\" was still contaminated, especially by molds. It was clarified that the molds came from contaminated baked wheat shells, or \"Kawa\" and further that the wheat shells were contaminated by molds during storage.","1096":"There have been very few reports of the effect of pesticides on immediate allergy. In the previous report, the effect of pyrethroid pesticides and organophosphorus pesticides on immediate allergic reaction was investigated. Subsequently, 12 organonitrogen pesticides, 14 carbamate pesticides and 4 other pesticides were investigated for their effects on the enzyme activity of beta-hexosaminidase as an index of chemical mediator release from rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). Two organonitrogen pesticides, bitertanol and pyridaben, and two organotin pesticides, cyhexatin and fenbutatin oxide, were found to promote beta-hexosaminidase release. Bitertanol non-specifically caused the promotion of chemical mediator release, while the release-promotive action of pyridaben was related to IgE antibody and those of cyhexatin and fenbutatin oxide to cell injury. On the other hand, two organonitrogen pesticides, propiconazole and triadimenol, and imazalil showed release-inhibitory action. These data suggested that some pesticides can affect immediate allergy.","1097":"We studied how predictive microbiology models could practically be applied to HACCP plans with two predictive software programs that are currently available. The software programs were the Food Micromodel elaborated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, U.K. and the Pathogen Modeling Program of Eastern Regional Research Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture. They successfully provided useful information on (i) the determination of Critical Control Points (CCPs), (ii) the estimation of critical limits at CCPs, (iii) the decision of abused products, (iv) the assessment of equivalence of HACCP plans, and further (v) the development of new products. With the information simulated by the software programs, HACCP teams could make scientific and objective decisions for developing their individual plans. It was also confirmed that microbiological process standards for food processing are indispensable for the application of the predictive programs to HACCP plans.","1098":"A determination method has been developed for azoxystrobin in tea by HPLC. Azoxystrobin was extracted from a sample with acetone, and the extract was passed through an alumina column to remove tannin. The eluate was concentrated to ca. 25 mL and passed through a Sep-Pak Vac tC18 to remove pigments. The eluate was cleaned-up by using liquid-liquid partition, and Florisil and silica-gel columns. The HPLC analysis for azoxystrobin was carried out on a C18 column with acetonitrile-water (9:11) as the mobile phase, with ultraviolet detection at 260 nm. The recovery of azoxystrobin fortified at the level of 0.4 microgram\/g was 90.2% and the limit of determination was 0.2 microgram\/g.","1099":"One of eight Food Blue No. 1 aluminum lakes (B-1Als) used in the official inspection of coal-tar colors in fiscal year 1999 had a violet sub-spot during paper chromatography and was rejected. To clarify the orgin of the sub-spot, the violet subsidiary color (Sub-V) was isolated from the sample. On the basis of NMR and MS analyses and ion chromatography, the structure of the subsidiary color was elucidated to be 2-[[4-[N-ethyl-N-(3- sulfophenylmethyl)amino]phenyl][4-hydroxyphenyl]methylio]benzenesulfonic acid. The relative content of Sub-V to that of m,m-B-1 in the rejected sample was determined to be 39.5% by HPLC. The relative contents in other submitted samples of B-1Al were in the range of 1.1-3.6%.","1100":"Moldy and split peanut kernels were separated from peanuts exported from Brazil, Sudan, India and Taiwan by visual inspection. The remaining peanuts from Brazil, Sudan and India were roasted lightly and the skins were removed. Stained peanuts were separated from the others. Aflatoxin was detected in moldy and stained peanuts. There was a positive correlation between % of aflatoxin-contaminated peanut kernels and aflatoxin B1 concentration in whole samples. Aflatoxin concentration of moldy peanuts was higher than that of stained peanut kernels.","1101":"A method using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed to detect the genetically modified (GM) papaya (55-1 line), of which the mandatory safety assessment has not been finished in Japan because of insufficient data. The papaya intrinsic papain gene was used as an internal control. The results of PCR amplification of the papain gene segment indicated that a commercial silica membrane type kit (QIAGEN DNeasy plant mini) was useful for extraction of DNA from papaya fruit, but not for extraction from canned papaya fruit. On the other hand, a commercial ion-exchange type kit (QIAGEN Genomic-tip) provided enough purified DNA for PCR from canned papaya fruit. Compared with the parental line and other commercial non-GM papayas, the DNA from GM papaya fruit provided specific amplification bands in PCR with five primer pairs (Nos. 2-6) including beta-glucuronidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II gene-specific ones. On the other hand, the primer pairs recognizing these genes showed false-positive results when we used DNAs from canned papaya. Therefore, we recommend that the primer pairs (Nos. 5 and 6) recognizing the sequences derived from two different species of organism should be used in order to detect specifically the GM papaya in canned fruits.","1102":"A simple and rapid analytical method was established for detection of anabolic agents, zeranol and alpha-trenbolone and beta-trenbolone residues in cattle muscle and liver. This method consisted of aqueous acetonitrile extraction and successive solid-phase extraction with a tandem connected octadecyl (C18)-aminopropyl (NH2) cartridge, followed by on-line clean-up using multidimensional HPLC with EC and UV detection. On-line clean-up was performed by a three-column switching technique, the first column being a Diol size exclusion column (SEC), the second, an internal surface reversed phase trapping column (TC) and the third, a C18 analytical column (AC). Sample solution from solid-phase extraction was injected into the SEC. The anabolic agents eluted from the SEC were introduced into a TC, and the anabolic agents trapped in the TC were rapidly loaded onto an analytical column after changing the eluent. Zeranol in the eluate from the analytical column was detected at 700 mV ECD and alpha- and beta-trenbolone were detected at UVD 350 nm. SEC and TC were washed and conditioned to the initial state just after the loading of the desired fraction on the AC. Recoveries from muscle fortified at a level of 0.002 mg\/L (maximal residue limits, MRLs) averaged 86.1% for zeranol and 77.0% for beta-trenbolone, and recoveries from liver at a level of 0.010 mg\/kg (MRLs) averaged 74.3% for zeranol and 73.1% for alpha-trenbolone. The quantitation limits for all of them were 0.001 mg\/kg in muscle and 0.002 mg\/kg in liver.","1103":"To study of the behavior of Trp-P-1 and its metabolites in rat feces and urine, rats were orally administered with Trp-P-1 (750, 1,500 and 2,500 micrograms\/rat), and excreted Trp-P-1 was analyzed using HPLC assay and bacterial mutagenicity assay. The extraction of Trp-P-1 from urine was performed by using the chloroform extraction method, and blue rayon was used for the extraction from feces. When Trp-P-1 was added to rat feces and urine, the recoveries of Trp-P-1 were 85.9 +\/- 3.9% and 91.3 +\/- 3.7%, respectively. The extracts of feces and urine from rats administered with Trp-P-1 were individually fractionated by thin layer chromatography on C18 gel. The major mutagenic zone corresponding to Trp-P-1 was found at Rf 0.09 in both extracts, while the feces extract gave two additional mutagenic zones at Rf 0.15 and 0.20. More than 97% of the fecal mutagenic activity was due to unchanged Trp-P-1. In rats administered with 750 micrograms of Trp-P-1, the amount of extracted Trp-P-1 and the number of His+ colonies induced by whole excreta were 81.6 +\/- 7.1 micrograms (n = 6) and (432 +\/- 77) x 10(4) for feces, and 28.7 +\/- 4.9 micrograms and (171 +\/- 28) x 10(4) for urine. The recoveries of Trp-P-1 in the feces and urine were 10.8 +\/- 0.9% and 3.8 +\/- 0.7% by HPLC analysis, and 11.1 +\/- 2.0% and 4.4 +\/- 0.7% by mutagenicity assay respectively. The results of the two assays seemed to show similar patterns of recovery.","1104":"Daily intakes of nitrate and nitrite of middle-aged men (30-59 years of age, n = 100) in Hiroshima Prefecture were estimated directly by the duplicate portion method. The daily intake of nitrate was 190.8 +\/- 128.5 mg. The daily intake of nitrate\/kg body weight was 2.87 +\/- 2.00 mg, which is about 78% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The daily intake of nitrate tended to increase with increasing age. The daily intake of nitrite was 3.837 +\/- 3.647 mg. The daily intake of nitrite\/kg body weight was 0.057 +\/- 0.050 mg, which is about 95% of the ADI. In the case of nitrite, there was no age-related difference. The proportions of men, whose daily intakes of nitrate and nitrite were above the ADI, were 27% and 34%, respectively. The proportion of men above the ADI of both nitrate and nitrite was 10%.","1105":"","1106":"","1107":"","1108":"","1109":"The effects of ordinary household cooking processes on concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (dioxins) were investigated in 'komatsuna', a green leafy vegetable popular in Japan. The concentrations of dioxins were compared using isomer-specific analyses of both uncooked and cooked edible parts of the plant. The mean total 2,3,7,8-chlorine substituted PCDD and PCDF concentrations were reduced from 46.53 pg\/g and 0.714 pg\/g to 8.301 pg\/g and 0.210 pg\/g by washing with tap water, and further reduced to 6.054 pg\/g and 0.148 pg\/g by subsequent boiling, respectively. The cooking processes markedly decreased the concentrations of PCDD\/Fs, while having little effect on those of dioxin-like PCBs. The mean total concentration as 2,3,7,8-tetraCDD equivalents (TEQ) was reduced from 0.058 pgTEQ\/g to 0.026 pgTEQ\/g by washing with tap water and further reduced to 0.019 pgTEQ\/g by subsequent boiling. These results suggest that ordinary cooking processes provide a means of reducing the level of dioxins in green leafy vegetables.","1110":"A survey of residual antibiotic agents in cultured fish and shellfish purchased from the Tokyo Central Market was carried out. Out of 240 samples tested, OTC was detected in 14 samples which consisted of flatfish, yellowtail, seriola and eel. Synthetic antibiotic agents were not detected. The highest level of OTC was 0.36 microgram\/g in skin of flatfish. In the case of flatfish, the concentration of OTC was highest in skin, followed by liver, then muscle. OTC was detected in livers of all yellowtail, seriola and eel, and the concentration was higher than that in muscle or skin.","1111":"A method for measuring sulfite residues in foods by using the modified Rankine apparatus and HPLC was developed. Sulfites released from foods by bubbling of nitrogen gas and heating for 15 minutes with an electric burner weRe absorbed in 1% triethanolamine solution and detected as sulfite ion by HPLC with a UV detector at 240 nm, using an anion exchange column, IonPac AS9-SC, with 1.8 mmol\/L sodium carbonate-1.7 mmol\/L sodium hydrogen carbonate solution as the mobile phase. The recoveries of sulfites added to 3 kinds of foods were 98-102%, and the determination limit was 0.001 g\/kg. The sulfite values in various kinds of foods determined by the proposed HPLC method were consistent with those obtained by the alkaline titration method and the colorimetric method.","1112":"Disposable gloves made from polyvinyl chloride with and without di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (PVC-DEHP, PVC-NP), polyethylene (PE), natural rubber (NR) and nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) were investigated with respect to evaporation residue, migrated metals, migrants and residual acrylonitrile. The evaporation residue found in n-heptane was 870-1,300 ppm from PVC-DEHP and PVC-NP, which was due to the plasticizers. Most of the PE gloves had low evaporation residue levels and migrants, except for the glove designated as antibacterial, which released copper and zinc into 4% acetic acid. For the NR and NBR gloves, the evaporation residue found in 4% acetic acid was 29-180 ppm. They also released over 10 ppm of calcium and 6 ppm of zinc into 4% acetic acid, and 1.68-8.37 ppm of zinc di-ethyldithiocarbamate and zinc di-n-butyldithiocarbamate used as vulcanization accelerators into n-heptane. The acrylonitrile content was 0.40-0.94 ppm in NBR gloves.","1113":"The residues of additives and other chemicals in 23 kinds of silicone rubber products for food contact use, including nipples, packing and spatulas, were investigated by GC\/MS. The packing and spatulas contained 80-480 micrograms\/g of BHT, 60-5,830 micrograms\/g of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and 60-80 micrograms\/g of dibutyl phthalate, while the nipples contained no additives. All of the samples contained 15 to 20 peaks of polydimethylcyclosiloxanes. Dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6) to tetratriacomethylcycloheptadecasiloxane (D17) were confirmed, and other larger siloxanes up to pentacontamethylcyclopentacosasiloxane (D25) were estimated. A rough estimate of the total cyclosiloxane content was 3,310-14,690 micrograms\/g. They might be mainly unreacted materials or by-products, and some of them might be additives. Based on the migration test, no chemicals were released into 20% ethanol at 60 degrees C for 30 min, though DEHP and the polydimethylcyclosiloxanes were released into n-heptane at 25 degrees C for 60 min.","1114":"The structural elucidation of the main constituents in enzymatically hydrolyzed coix extract, a natural food preservative, was carried out. After peracetylation, five compounds, namely peracetylated forms of glucose, maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, and maltopentaose were isolated. The structures were determined by PFG HMQC and HMBC experiments. In addition, by using HPLC with an RI detector, the main components of this coix extract were identified as a mixture of oligosaccharides having one to seven glucose units coupled through alpha-(1--&gt;4) linkages. Since this extract showed no antimicrobial activity, its preservative effect may be caused by its covering of the food surface, thereby blocking contact with air.","1115":"An analytical method for residues of the herbicide glyphosate [GLY: N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine] and its metabolite (AMPA: aminomethylphosphonic acid) in agricultural products is described. GLY and AMPA were extracted with water (soybeans extract was moreover treated with acetone), and purified by application to a dual mini-cartridge column (octadecyl-bonded silica gel and cation-exchange silica gel) system. GLY was derivatized with 9-fluorenylmethylchloroformate, and determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. AMPA determination was performed by HPLC employing postcolumn fluorogenic labeling with o-phthalaldehyde-mercaptoethanol. The detection limits for GLY and AMPA were 0.04 microgram\/g (soybean: 0.08 microgram\/g), and both recoveries from samples to which the compounds were added at the 0.2 microgram\/g level (soybean: 1.0 microgram\/g) were more than 65%.","1116":"HPLC analysis revealed that eight subsidiary colors existed in commercial Food Green No. 3 (fast green FCF, FD &amp; C Green No. 3). Among them, four subsidiary colors C, F, G, and H were isolated by using preparative HPLC and their structures were determined by MS and NMR. They were the disodium salt of 2-[[4-[N-ethyl-N-(3- sulfophenylmethyl)amino]phenyl][4-[N-ethyl-N-(4- sulfophenylmethyl)amino]phenyl]methylio]-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (abbreviated as m,p-G-3), the sodium salt of 2-[[(4-N-ethylamino)phenyl][4-[N-ethyl-N-(3- sulfophenylmethyl)amino]-phenyl]methylio]-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid [abbreviated as HSBA-(EA) (m-EBASA)], the sodium salt of 2-[[(4-N-diethylamino)phenyl][4-[N-ethyl-N-(3- sulfophenylmethyl)amino]phenyl]-methylio]-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid [abbreviated as HSBA-(di-EA) (m-EBASA)], and the sodium salt of 2-[[4-[N-ethyl-N-(phenylmethyl)amino]phenyl][4-[N-ethyl-N-(3- sulfophenylmethyl)-amino]phenyl]methylio]-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid [abbreviated as HSBA-(EBA)(m-EBASA)], respectively.

FBTO and CHT spiked into rice, soybeans, spinach, orange, tea powder and tea extract at the level of 0.5 microgram\/g for FBTO and 0.1 microgram\/g for CHT were analyzed in replicate in 6 laboratories. Means recoveries of FBTO were 85.2-96.5% and those of CHT were 83.5-89.2% except from soybeans (46.5%). Repeatability relative standard deviation values of FBTO and CHT in each crop were in the ranges of 2.3-9.4% and 3.2-6.3%, respectively. Reproducibility relative standard deviations were 3.9-12.6% for FBTO and 8.3-12.9% for CHT. Detection limits were 0.015-0.05 microgram\/g for FBTO and 0.005-0.02 microgram\/g for CHT.","1122":"An unknown peak (peak A) was detected in a mass chromatogram of komatsuna extract containing a high concentration of phenthoate (PAP), and it was considered to be O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorodithioate (OOS). Although it is generally known that OOS exists as an impurity in technical malathion and PAP, it has not been reported that OOS is present in crops. Since an OOS standard is not commercially available, OOS was separated and purified from commercial emulsifiable malathion. Peak A was confirmed to be OOS by GC\/MS using the purified OOS. The concentration of OOS was estimated to be 0.02 microgram\/g. It is supposed that OOS was detected in crops because they contained a high concentration of PAP residue.","1123":"The aim of this study is to clarify whether sennosides are contained in the leaf of Malva verticillata L., and then to clarify the source of sennosides in health teas including malva leaves. The identification and determination of sennosides were performed with thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. The leaf of Malva verticillata L. did not contain sennosides A or B and could be easily distinguished from senna leaf. Our previous report showed that sennosides are contained in weight-reducing herbal teas including malva leaves, and that senna leaf is a herbal component in some teas. Furthermore, in 10 samples of health tea including malva leaves that were bought last year, the smallest amount of sennosides was 6.1 mg\/bag, and all health teas including malva leaves contained the leaf and midrib of senna. We suggest that sennosides A and B are not contained in the leaf of Malva verticillata L., and that the sennosides in health teas including malva leaves are not derived from malva leaf but from senna leaf.","1124":"A method using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was designed for the detection of genetically modified maize CBH351, which has not authorized as safe for use in foods and feeds in Japan yet. We analyzed a recombinant DNA (r-DNA) sequence introduced into CBH351 maize and designed specific primer pairs to amplify a segment including part of the r-DNA. The PCR products obtained by using the designed primer pairs are specific for CBH351 and should prevent false positive results caused by other maizes and other main cereal crops. The r-DNA introduced into CBH351 could be detected from maize samples containing 0.05-0.1% CBH351 maize. This sensitivity is theoretically equivalent to a level of several genome copies and so this technique is a very efficient means to detect CBH351 maize.","1125":"The poisonous mushroom Clitocybe acromelalga contains clitidine, which resembles nicotinic acid mononucleotide, and 4-amino-pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, which resembles quinolinic acid. Both are important intermediates in the tryptophan-niacin pathway. Therefore, we investigated the effect of feeding a niacin-free and tryptophan-limited diet containing the toadstool Clitocybe acromelalga on the metabolism of tryptophan to niacin in rats. The toadstool diet was fed to the rats for only one day (this day was designated day 0). Urinary excretion of intermediates in the tryptophan-niacin pathway, such as anthranilic acid, kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, quinolinic acid, nicotinamide, N1-methylnicotinamide, N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide, was higher in the toadstool group than in the control on day 0-day 1 and day 1-day 2. The blood levels of tryptophan and NAD on day 1 were also higher in the toadstool group. Accordingly, intake of Clitocybe acromelalga appeared to increase the conversion of tryptophan to niacin.","1126":"Dietary intake of a poisonous mushroom, Clitocybe acromelalga, causes acromelalgia. The symptom continues for over a month. Some papers reported that treatment with nicotinic acid is effective. We have established an animal model to elucidate the mechanism of toxicity of the poisonous mushroom Clitocybe acromelalga. Diet containing Clitocybe acromelalga was fed to niacin-deficient rats for 24 hours (designated as day 0). The food intake decreased to about one-half compared with that of day before, and body weight loss was noted. Although the diet was returned to the control diet on day 1, the food intake did not recover until day 7, and body weight gain was not seen until day 6. A severe symptom resembling acromelalgia in humans started to appear on day 3. This is the first report of an animal model for the intoxication of Clitocybe acromelalga in humans. Since no similar symptom resembling human intoxication was seen in a previous rodent study, the niacin-free\/tryptophan-limited diet used in the present study may have contributed to the result.","1127":"The residues of additives and other chemicals were investigated by GC\/MS in natural rubber products for food contact, which included nipples, packing, gloves and a net for ham. The packings and gloves contained 980-6,570 micrograms\/g of vulcanization accelerators, such as zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate, zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (EZ), zinc di-n-buthyldithiocarbamate (BZ) and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole. Some samples contained BHT, Irganox 1076 and Yoshinox 2246R as antioxidants; dibutyl phthalate and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate as plasticizers; and palmitic acid, stearic acid, palmitamide, stearamide and hydrocarbons as lubricants. Two unknown peaks were identified as stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol, and others were estimated to be fucosterol, oryzanol and alpha-sitosterol. These sterols are widely distributed in plants, so their origin was presumed to be the rubber plants. The sterols were detected at a level of 340-2,940 micrograms\/g in all natural rubber samples. A migration test was carried out for some samples. No chemicals were released into water, 4% acetic acid or 20% ethanol at 60 degrees C for 30 min, though BHT, Yoshinox 2246R, EZ, BZ and sterols were released into n-heptane at 25 degrees C for 60 min.","1128":"For the analysis of flavonoids by HPLC, we compared three different detection methods, namely UV, electrochemical detection and post-column chelation with aluminum followed by fluorescence detection. Ten flavonoids were used: apigenin, myricetin, luteorin, taxifolin, quercetin-3-O-sulfate, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, isoquercitrin, quercetin and rutin. Nine flavonoids except apigenin were efficiently detected by the electrochemical method with a detection limit of 0.025-0.05 pmol. Flavonols having free 3-hydroxyl and 4-keto oxygen formed a fluorescent complex by post-column chelation and were detected by the fluorescence method. The detection limit of the fluorescence method was 0.05-0.5 pmol. Nine flavonoids except taxifolin were detected by the UV method (absorbance at 370 nm), but the detection level was poor (5-10 pmol). Flavonols added to human plasma were recovered by solid phase extraction, and were analyzed using the three detection methods. Most of the flavonols were efficiently detected by the electrochemical and fluorescence methods, and the detection limits were similar to those of standard samples.","1129":"","1130":"","1131":"","1132":"","1133":"Fukuronori extract (FE), which is mainly composed of polysaccharides, and is an extract of the seaweed Gloiopeltis furcata, is permitted for use as a food thickening agent by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan. In order to study the subchronic toxicity of FE, F344 rats of both genders were administered FE at concentrations of 0% (basal diet, control group), 0.5%, 1.5% and 5.0% in basal powder diet for 90 days, and observation of general condition, recording of body weight and food consumption, examination of hematology and blood chemistry, measurement of organ weight, and pathological examination were performed. Food consumption tended to increase in both sexes given FE at 1.5% and 5.0% throughout most of the experimental period. This was, however, considered not to be a toxic effect because the differences in body weight were small. Total cholesterol and triglycerides in serum decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) and not significantly, respectively, in males of the 5.0% group. These changes were considered to be related to the intake of FE, but the differences were slight and within physiological ranges. Hematological and pathological examination revealed neither any particular adverse effect nor any significant difference from the control. Hence, dietary intake of 5.0% of FE, 3,362 mg\/kg\/day for males and 3,594 mg\/kg\/day for females as mean daily intake, for 90 days was considered to be a no observable adverse effect level in rats.","1134":"A method for qualitative and quantitative analyses of polysorbates in powdered soup by HPLC was studied. Polysorbates in samples were extracted with acetonitrile after rinsing with n-hexane to remove fats and oils. The extract was cleaned up using a Bond Elut silica gel cartridge (500 mg). The cartridge was washed with ethyl acetate and polysorbates were eluted with a small amount of acetonitrile-methanol (1:2) mixture. The eluate was treated with cobalt thiocyanate solution to form a blue complex with polysorbate. In order to determine polysorbate, the complex was subjected to HPLC with a GPC column, using a mixture of acetonitrile-water (95:5) as a mobile phase, with a detection wavelength of 620 nm. The recoveries of polysorbate 80 added to powdered soups were more than 75% and the determination limit was 0.04 mg\/g. When the proposed method was applied to the determination of polysorbates in 16 commercial samples of powdered soup for instant noodles and seasoning consomme, no polysorbates were detected in any sample.","1135":"Buddleja yellow colorant derived from Buddleja officinalis Maxim. has recently been approved for use as a new kind of natural colorant for food additives in China. In order to distinguish Buddleja yellow colorant from other yellow colorants, two known phenylpropanoid glycosides, acteoside (= verbascoside) and poliumoside, were isolated from the colorant as marker substances for Buddleja yellow colorant. Poliumoside has not been detected in B. officinalis Maxim. previously. These phenylpropanoid glycosides were not detected in the fruits of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis or in the stamens of the flowers of Crocus sativus L., which also contain crocetin derivatives as coloring components, using a photodiode array and mass chromatograms. Thus, an analytical HPLC method was developed to distinguish foods that have been colored with yellow colorants containing crocetin derivatives, using phenylpropanoid glycosides as markers.","1136":"A simple and rapid method using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) for the determination of milt protein (MP), which contains mainly protamine, and polylysine (PL) in food additive preparations and processed foods was developed. CZE separation was performed on poly(vinyl alcohol)-coated capillaries at a column temperature of 20 degrees C with 120 mmol\/L phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) as the running buffer. The influence of various components in food additive preparations on CZE analysis of MP and PL was examined. Egg white lysozyme, glycine, sodium acetate, glycerol, fumaric acid, calcium carbonate, dextrin, emulsifiers and sodium polyphosphate and pyrophosphate had no effect. No peak of protamine was detected in preparations containing metaphosphate. The analysis method for processed foods was composed of extraction with 4% formic acid, precipitation of macromolecular compounds with ethanol, concentration in a water bath and determination by CZE. The average recoveries were 108.4% for protamine sulfate (PS) in red bean sticky rice, and 81.3% for PL in white rice, 118% in egg sandwiches, and 115% in shiraae. The limits of detection of PS in red bean sticky rice and PL in white rice were both 50 ppm.","1137":"An analytical method using GC\/MS was developed for bisphenol A (BPA) in foods and BPA was determined in canned foods and fresh foods such as vegetables, fruit and meat. BPA was extracted with acetone from the samples and the extract was concentrated at under 40 degrees C in vacuo to afford an aqueous solution, which was washed with hexane after alkalization and extracted with 50% diethyl ether-hexane after acidification. Extracts were cleaned up on a PSA and\/or a C18 cartridge column, and BPA was derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride and determined by GC\/MS (SIM). This method was applicable to the detection and determination of BPA residues in food samples at the level of 1 ng\/g. Among canned foods, BPA was found in 6 corned beef, 1 chicken, 9 sweet corn and 3 bean samples at the levels of 17-602 ng\/g, 212 ng\/g, 2.3-75 ng\/g and 3.5-26 ng\/g, respectively. BPA was also detected in 1 retort soup and 1 retort pack product at the levels of 11 ng\/g and 86 ng\/g, respectively. As for dairy products, BPA was not detected in butter and milk. Among fresh foods, BPA was detected in 2 fish and 3 liver samples at the levels of trace (tr)-6.2 ng\/g and tr-2.2 ng\/g, respectively. In vegetables, fruits and chocolates, a trace level of BPA was detected in only 1 chocolate. Traces of BPA were also detected in 3 samples of 6 boxed lunches.","1138":"","1139":"Dioxin concentrations and homologue profiles were examined in plucked new shoots, crude tea and its hot water extracts, soils and atmosphere in tea orchards. The rate of dry provisions in crude tea has increased 4 times as that of the plucked new shoots. However, dioxin concentrations except O8CDD in crude tea have increased only 2 to 3 times as those of the plucked new shoots. O8CDD concentration increased remarkably during processing. Little dioxins were detected in hot water extracts of crude tea leaves.","1140":"Water concentration in organic solvents after liquid-liquid partition was determined by the Karl Fischer titration method. n-Hexane and petroleum ether showed quite low levels of water, such as 0.1 mg\/mL. The water concentration in wet ethyl acetate was about 20-30 mg\/mL and that in diethyl ether was about 8-10 mg\/mL. Anhydrous sodium sulfate absorbed about 20-25% of the water after vigorous mixing with wet ethyl acetate or diethyl ether. Wet acetonitrile extract from wet food, which contained about 60 mg\/mL water after salting out with sodium chloride, was not dried at all with anhyfrous sodium sulfate treatment. Spiking n-hexane into wet ethyl acetate or wet diethyl ether was effective to exclude water. Spiking toluene into salted acetonitrile drove out water and dissolved sodium chloride. It can be concluded that the drying ability of anhydrous sodium sulfate towards wet organic solvents is poor, but it is effective in removing suspended water in solvents.","1141":"The antigenicity and phototoxicity of water-soluble extract from Salacia reticulata (SRE) were examined in guinea pigs. In a study of active systemic anaphylaxis reaction, neither the oral administration group (64 or 320 mg\/kg, 5 times\/week, 3 weeks) nor the subcutaneous administration group (64 mg\/kg, 1 time\/week, 3 weeks) exhibited any anaphylactic reaction. Moreover, sensitization with serum obtained from these animals did not induce passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction in normal animals. In a phototoxicity study, oral administration of SRE (320 mg\/kg) induced neither erythema nor edema. These results suggest that SRE is not antigenic or phototoxic.","1142":"A method for the determination of sucralose in various foods by RI-HPLC and ion chromatography with a pulsed amperometric detector (PAD-IC) was developed. Chopped or homogenized samples were packed into cellulose tubing with 0.01 mol\/L hydrochloric acid containing 10% sodium chloride and were dialyzed against 0.01 mol\/L hydrochloric acid for 24 hours. The dialyzate was passed through a Bond Elut ENV cartridge, and the cartridge was washed with 0.2 mol\/L NaOH and water. Sucralose was eluted from the cartridge with methanol. The extract was taken to dryness in an evaporator and the residue was re-dissolved in water. Sucralose was separated on an Inertsil ODS-3V column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water (15:85) and an RI detector. It was also determined on a CarboPak PA1 column with a mobile phase of 100 mmol\/L NaOH-75 mmol\/L CH3COONa, using a PAD detector. The recoveries of sucralose from various kinds of foods spiked at 50 micrograms\/g and 200 micrograms\/g ranged from 88-105%. The detection limit in samples was 10 micrograms\/g for RI-HPLC and 1 microgram\/g for PAD-IC.","1143":"Simple and rapid methods for the determination of sucralose in foods were developed using anion-exchange chromatography (AEC) with pulsed amperometric detection and reverse-phase HPLC with refractive index detection. Sucralose was extracted with water or methanol, and the extracted solution was cleaned up on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and a Sep-Pak Alumina N cartridge. The AEC separation was performed on a CarboPac PA1 column (4.0 mm i.d x 250 mm) using 100 mmol\/L sodium hydroxide-50 mmol\/L sodium acetate solution as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL\/min. The recoveries of sucralose from foods were 80.6-102.0%, and quantitation limits from foods except chewing gum were 0.5 microgram\/g (2 micrograms\/g from chewing gum). The reverse-phase HPLC separation was performed on an Inertsil ODS-3V column (4.6 mm i.d x 150 mm) using methanol-water (25:75) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL\/min. The recoveries of sucralose from foods were 80.2-121.2%, and quantitation limits from foods except chewing gum were 5 micrograms\/g (20 micrograms\/g from chewing gum).","1144":"Ten samples of retail packed lunches purchased from convenience stores were determined for 11 phthalates and di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) in August 2000, 2 months after the prohibition of DEHP-containing PVC gloves in Japan. Each homogenized sample was extracted with acetonitrile, partitioned with n-hexane, and cleaned up using Florisil and PSA columns. Phthalates in the extract were determined by GC\/MS (SIM). The limits of detection were 14.9 ng\/g for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and 18.6 ng\/g for dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Levels of phthalates in packed lunch samples were 45 to 517 ng DEHP\/g (198 ng\/g, average), ND to 90 ng DEHA\/g, and ND to 10.0 ng BBP\/g. Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) was detected in one sample at 76 ng\/g. Average DEHP level in ten samples was 4% of that in 1999. The contents of other phthalates were also reduced. DBP was not detected in any sample. Recovery of deuterated isomers added as surrogates was 27.9% for DNP-d4, and 40.6 to 101.5% for the other phthalates.","1145":"Daily intake of isoflavones (daidzin, glycitin, genistin, daidzein, glycitein, and genistein) was determined quantitatively, based on the market basket method. Acid hydrolysis during extraction of foods was chosen to convert phytoestrogenes into the respective aglycons, facilitating HPLC analysis and allowing quantitation of total isoflavones as aglycones including both originally present glycosides and \"free\" aglycones. The isoflavones were extracted from samples with methanol and determined by reversed-phase HPLC analysis using a linear gradient of methanol-water as the eluent. From the results of hydrolysis, the daily intake of total isoflavon was 38.1 mg\/adult Japanese. The values obtained by the market basket method and the National Nutrition Survey method were similar.","1146":"Modification of HPLC conditions for the determinations of raw materials, intermediates and subsidiary colors (organic impurities) in 5 kinds of food azo colors were studied in order to analyze them simply and rapidly. The organic impurities were determined by HPLC using L-column ODS and a gradient system (0.02 mol\/L ammonium acetate solution for 10 min, and a gradient with a mixture of acetonitrile and water (7:3)). The organic impurities in 163 samples of azo colors subjected to inspection in fiscal year 1999 were determined under the proposed HPLC conditions. It was found that the contents of organic impurities in 163 samples were less than the limit of Japan's Specifications and Standards for Food Additives, 7th Edition.","1147":"The contents of the main pigments and other ingredients in commercial lac color products were determined by HPLC using an RP-18 column with 0.1 mol\/L citric acid buffer solution-methanol (16:5) as the mobile phase, and a photodiode array (PDA) detector set at 280 nm and 490 nm. The main pigments were confirmed by PDA and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Laccaic acids A, B, C and E were detected in all lac color products, and the ratio of content of laccaic acid A in all products was over 50%. The total contents of laccaic acids A, B and C in lac color food additive products and reagent products were 775-858, 797 and 779 g\/kg, respectively. As for the contents of ingredients except pigments in commercial food additive products, the maximum moisture content was about 10%, and ether-soluble substances amounted to 0.5-3.6%.","1148":"When performing multiresidue analysis of pesticides, the recovery of thiometon was less than 20% from carrots and eggplants, but about 100% from garlic chives and welsh onions. The recovery of thiometon was found to depend on the lot of ethyl acetate. A 2-year-old lot of ethyl acetate caused degradation of thiometon, but a fresh lot of ethyl acetate did not. Analysis showed that ethyl acetate stored for 2 years contained about 5 microL\/mL of acetaldehyde. Thiometon was also degraded by acetone or acetonitrile, when acetaldehyde was added to them, in the same manner as by aged ethyl acetate. The fact that the recovery of thiometon from welsh onions was about 100% indicated that some of the mercaptans in allium vegetables may prevent thiometon degradation. Mercaptans such as L-cysteine and 3-mercaptoproionic acid were confirmed to prevent the degradation of thiometon and disulfoton. These findings show that mercaptans may be useful additives for analyzing thiometon and disulfoton.","1149":"","1150":"","1151":"Natural flavor was accidentally produced from rice cake products in Japan. A non-stick oil had been sprayed on the products during the production process. It was found that a Penicillium corylophilum strain, a contaminant of the oil, produced the flavor from the oil. The ingredients of the flavor were four volatile substances, 2-heptanone, 2-nonanone, 2-heptanol, and 2-nonanol. Challenge tests with the mould strain in a rice cake system were performed under various conditions. The volatile substances were produced in the largest amounts at 25 degrees C, followed by 20 or 30 degrees C then 10 degrees C. 2-Heptanone was produced most remarkably at 25 degrees C, followed by 2-nonanone, 2-heptanol, and 2-nonanol. The growth patterns of the mould were similar between 20-30 degrees C, and the growth at 10 degrees C was delayed. The non-stick oil itself had neither flavor nor volatile substance. The flavor was also produced from coconut oil, which was one of the materials of the non-stick oil. No bacteria or yeasts tested produced any flavor from the non-stick oil, whereas most of the moulds tested produced flavor components.","1152":"In an earlier report, we developed a rapid, sensitive and clean method consisting of non-chloroform extraction, clean-up on a commercial multifunctional cartridge column and HPLC with fluorescence detection for the analyses of aflatoxins. In this report, we applied this method to analyze aflatoxins in nuts, giant corn, cereals, spice and black teas. The method was effective for macadamia nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, brazil nuts, giant corn, rice, wheat and buckwheat, and the recoveries of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2 spiked in them at the level of 10 ng\/g were 85-106%. However, in the chromatograms of spices and black tea, many background peaks were observed. Therefore, we added a purification step with an affinity column to the clean-up of these samples with the multifunctional cartridge column. After the additional purification, most of the background peaks were gone. The recoveries of aflatoxins B1, B2 and G1 spiked at the level of 10 ng\/g were 71-112% except for the case of B2 in white pepper (48%). The recoveries of G2 were 49-95%.","1153":"The presence of plasticizers in PVC toys obtained in October 1998 was investigated. Diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), dinonyl phthalate (DNP), diheptyl phthalate (DHP), and di-2-ethylhexyl adipate (DEHA) were detected. The phthalates were found in all of the 68 samples. The principal phthalate found in toys was DINP, which was present in 48 of 68 samples. The DINP content ranged from 15 mg\/g to 580 mg\/g, and mean content was 308 mg\/g. The highest content was found in a pacifier toy. DEHP was present in 20 of 68 samples and the content ranged from 2.0 mg\/g to 380 mg\/g. The mean content was 162 mg\/g. It was found in 60% of domestic toys.","1154":"A simple and rapid method using HPLC was developed for the determination of isocitric acid in food additive citric acid. One gram of sample was dissolved in 100 mL of water. HPLC separation was performed on an Inertsil ODS-3 column (4.6 mm i.d. x 250 mm) using 0.1% phosphoric acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL\/min. Isocitric acid was detected at 210 nm. The calibration graph was rectilinear from 5 to 100 micrograms\/mL. The recoveries of isocitric acid from sample at the levels of 0.1% and 0.4% were 98% and 99%, respectively, and the determination limit was 0.05%.","1155":"An HPLC method was developed for the determination of neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC) in foods. A solid sample was extracted with methanol. The extract was evaporated and the residue was dissolved in methanol-water (2:8) mixture. In the case of fluid sample, the sample solution was prepared by dilution with methanol-water (2:8) mixture. The sample solution was cleaned up on a C18 cartridge. The cartridge was washed with water and methanol-water (3:7) mixture, and NHDC was eluted with methanol-water (7:3) mixture. NHDC in the eluate was separated on an ODS column and determined with a UV detector (282 nm). The identity of NHDC in foods was confirmed by means of HPLC with a photodiode-array detector. The recoveries of NHDC added to various kinds of foods were 75.2-134%. The determination limit of NHDC was 1 microgram\/g.","1156":"We evaluated the TaqMan PCR Salmonella amplification\/detection kit (PE Applied Biosystems) for rapid detection of Salmonella from a variety of meat samples. This system uses the 5' nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase, which digests an internal fluorogenic probe to monitor the amplification of the target gene. The detection sensitivity of the kit, using 2 kinds of DNA extraction protocols, was compared with that obtained with 4 protocols of official culture methods. A total of 98 meat samples (16 raw beef, 31 pork and 51 chicken) were tested. The results of the TaqMan PCR method and the combined results of the 4 cultural protocols showed excellent agreement. However, no single culture protocol showed optimal recovery of Salmonella comparable to the PCR method. These results suggest that the TaqMan PCR method is a reliable and rapid method useful for detecting Salmonella in meat products.","1157":"Seven lines of genetically modified (GM) maize have been authorized in Japan as foods and feeds imported from the USA. We improved a multiplex PCR method described in the previous report in order to distinguish the five lines of GM maize. Genomic DNA was extracted from GM maize with a silica spin column kit, which could reduce experimental time and improve safety in the laboratory and potentially in the environment. We sequenced recombinant DNA (r-DNA) introduced into GM maize, and re-designed new primer pairs to increase the specificity of PCR to distinguish five lines of GM maize by multiplex PCR. A primer pair for the maize intrinsic zein gene (Ze1) was also designed to confirm the presence of amplifiable maize DNA. The lengths of PCR products using these six primer pairs were different. The Ze1 and the r-DNAs from the five lines of GM maize were qualitatively detected in one tube. The specific PCR bands were distinguishable from each other on the basis of the expected length. The r-DNA could be detected from maize samples containing 0.5% of each of the five lines of GM maize. The sensitivity would be acceptable to secure the verification of non-GMO materials and to monitor the reliability of the labeling system.","1158":"The daily dietary intake of aluminum was estimated through a total diet study from 1996 to 1998. In ten institutes, total diet study samples were prepared and their aluminum concentration was determined. The average daily intake of aluminum was 3.5 mg and the range was 1.8-8.4 mg. The validity of the analytical result was supported by analyses of certified reference materials.","1159":"In the previous investigation, we found that some cans for coffee and black tea drinks released large amounts of bisphenol A (BPA) into their contents. Equivalent cans were obtained and the cause of BPA migration was investigated. Equivalent cans A, B and D contained high levels of BPA in the side seam, in the bottom, and in the bottom and the side seam, respectively, while can C contained some level of BPA in the body, which has a large area, therefore, all of them contained high amounts of BPA in their coatings. In the migration test, there was no BPA migration from the cans into water at 60 and 95 degrees C for 30 min, into 20% ethanol at 60 degrees C for 30 min, or into n-heptane at 25 degrees C for 60 min. However, at 120 degrees C for 30 min, equivalent cans released 35-124 ng\/mL BPA into the water. The total migration was similar to the total residues of BPA in the can coating and was close to the total amount of BPA in the drinks. Thus, BPA migration from the can coating requires heating to more than 105 degrees C, which is the glass transition temperature of the epoxy resin. Improved cans which contained less than 1\/10 as much BPA as the equivalent cans showed very low migration levels, i.e., 3-6 ng\/mL.","1160":"An automated analytical method for determination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fish was developed using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) in combination with an automated sample preparation instrument (Prep) and GC\/MS. By incorporating basic alumina with the sample in the extraction process, and optimizing the amount of carbon dioxide used, fish lipid was selectively reduced. The extract was cleaned up on a Florisil cartridge with Prep. The method was evaluated using naturally contaminated tissues and by comparison of automated analytical method results with those obtained by the conventional method. Mean recovery of PCBs from 3 kinds of fish including hairtail, mackerel and yellowtail were 69.8%, 90.2% and 81.1%, respectively. This method is less laborious and requires far less organic solvent than the conventional method, but produced comparable results."},"articletitle":{"0":"[Study of Rapid Simultaneous Determination of
