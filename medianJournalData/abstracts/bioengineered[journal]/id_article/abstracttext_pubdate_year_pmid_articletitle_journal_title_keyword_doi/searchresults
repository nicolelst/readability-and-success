IV (AS-IV) is a bioactive saponin extracted from the Astragalus root and has been reported to exert a protective effect on diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we found that AS-IV treatment alleviated DN symptoms in DN mice accompanied by reduced metabolic parameters (body weight, urine microalbumin and creatinine, creatinine clearance, and serum urea nitrogen and creatinine), pathological changes, and apoptosis. Epigenetic histone modifications are closely related to diabetes and its complications, including H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1, a promoter of gene transcription). A ChIP-seq assay was conducted to identify the genes regulated by H3K4me1 in DN mice after AS-IV treatment and followed by a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. The results showed that there were 16 common genes targeted by H3K4me1 in normal and AS-IV-treated DN mice, 1148 genes were targeted by H3K4me1 only in DN mice. From the 1148 genes, we screened mitogen-activating protein kinase kinase kinase kinase-3 (MAP4K3) for the verification of gene expression and functional study. The results showed that MAP4K3 was significantly increased in DN mice and high glucose (HG)-treated NRK-52E cells, which was reversed by AS-IV. MAP4K3 silencing reduced the apoptosis of NRK-52E cells under HG condition, as evidenced by decreased cleaved caspase 3 and Bax (pro-apoptotic factors), and increased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl (anti-apoptotic factors). Collectively, AS-IV may downregulate MAP4K3 expression by regulating H3K4me1 binding and further reducing apoptosis, which may be one of the potential mechanisms that AS-IV plays a protective effect on DN.","2":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become the leading cause of blindness among adults at working age. Previous studies have implicated circ_0001897 in the development of DR. In this study, we investigated the functional roles and mechanisms of circ_0001897 in high glucose-induced angiogenesis and inflammation. Peripheral blood samples from DR patients and healthy controls were collected to examine circ_0001897 expression, which demonstrated a significant upregulation of circ_0001897 in DR patients. To investigate the functional role and mechanisms of circ_0001897, human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) were treated with high glucose (HG) to establish an in vitro DR model of endothelial cells. HG treatment induced the upregulation of circ_0001897 in HRECs, and enhanced cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, as well as in vitro angiogenesis. Circ_0001897 knockdown significantly attenuated the cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, and angiogenesis induced by HG treatment. Mechanistically, circ_0001897 sponged and inhibited the activity of mir-29c-3p, which in turn regulates the downstream target transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFB2). The effects of circ_0001897 knockdown could be rescued by mir-29c-3p inhibitor or TGFB2 overexpression. Collectively, our data demonstrated the novel role of circ_0001897\/mir-29c-3p\/TGFB2 axis in regulating HG-induced inflammation and angiogenesis of HRECs. These findings suggest that targeting circ_0001897 could serve as an intervention strategy to ameliorate DR.","3":"Patellar instability (PI) is a common knee injury in adolescents, but the crucial biomarkers and molecular mechanisms associated with it remain unclear. We established a PI mouse model and investigated PI-related changes in gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis and enrichment analysis were performed to identify crucial genes and pathways associated with PI. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction, DEG-miRNA, DEG-transcription factors, and DEG-drug interaction networks were constructed to reveal hub genes, molecular mechanism, and potential drugs for PI. Finally, the reliability of the sequencing results was confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. Upon comparison with the control group, 69 genes were differently expressed in PI, including 17 upregulated and 52 downregulated ones. The DEGs were significantly enriched in Janus kinase (JAK)\/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway and immune responses. The protein-protein interaction network identified ten PI-related hub genes, all of which are involved in the JAK\/STAT signaling pathway or inflammation-related pathways. DEG-miRNA and DEG-transcription factor networks offered new insights for regulating DEGs post-transcriptionally. We also determined potential therapeutic drugs or molecular compounds that could restore dysregulated expression of DEGs via the DGIdb database. RT-qPCR results were consistent with the RNA-seq, confirming the reliability of the sequencing data. Immunohistochemistry results suggested that JAK1 and STAT3 expression was increased in PI. Our study explored the potential molecular mechanisms in PI, provided promising biomarkers and suggested a molecular basis for therapeutic targets for this condition.","4":null,"5":"Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion damages local brain tissue and impairs brain function, but its specific pathogenesis is still uncertain. Recent studies have clarified circPUM1 is aberrantly elevated in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury; however, circPUM1's function in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion-induced neuronal injury remains ambiguous. The results illustrated circPUM1 and DEAD-box helicase 5 were decreased, but microRNA-340-5p was elevated in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mice and oxygen glucose deprivation\/reoxygenation-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Knockdown of circPUM1 aggravated the neuronal injury in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mice and motivated glial cell activation, neuronal apoptosis and inflammation. Enhancing circPUM1 restrained oxygen glucose deprivation\/reoxygenation-induced SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis, the release of lactate dehydrogenase and inflammatory factors, and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB pathway, while elevating microRNA-340-5p aggravated oxygen glucose deprivation\/reoxygenation-induced cell damage. Functional rescue experiments exhibited that the impacts of knockdown or enhancement of circPUM1 were turned around by microRNA-340-5p downregulation and DEAD-box helicase 5 silencing, respectively. Moreover, it was demonstrated that circPUM1 competitively adsorbed microRNA-340-5p to mediate DEAD-box helicase 5. All in all, this study clarifies that circPUM1 mitigates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion-induced neuronal injury by targeting the microRNA-340-5p\/DEAD-box helicase 5 axis.","6":"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of renal carcinomas, with high mortality and poor prognoses worldwide. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) consists of four nuclear-encoded subunits and it is the only complex involved in both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Previous studies have shown decreased SDH activity in ccRCC. However, the role and underlying molecular mechanisms of SDH in ccRCC initiation and development remain unclear. In the present study, pan-cancer analysis of SDH gene expression was analyzed and the relationship between SDH gene expression and clinicopathological parameters was assessed using different databases. cBioPortal, UACLAN, and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) were subsequently utilized to analyze genetic alterations, methylation, and immune cell infiltration of SDH genes in ccRCC patients. We found SDHs were significantly downregulated in ccRCC tissues and correlated with ccRCC progression. Increased methylation and high SDH promoter mutation rates may be the cause of reduced expression of SDHs in ccRCC. Moreover, the interaction network showed that SDH genes were correlated with ferroptosis-related genes. We further demonstrated that SDH inhibition dampened oxidative phosphorylation, reduced ferroptotic events, and restored ferroptotic cell death, characterized by eliminated mitochondrial ROS levels, decreased cellular ROS and diminished peroxide accumulation. Collectively, this study provides new insights into the regulatory role of SDH in the carcinogenesis and progression of ccRCC, introducing a potential target for advanced antitumor therapy through ferroptosis.","7":null,"8":"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response caused by infection, and severe sepsis is commonly associated with the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). Accumulating evidence has revealed the implication of circular RNAs in AKI. In this study, we explored the potential engagement and the underlying mechanism of hsa_circ_010157 (circSTRN3) in sepsis-induced AKI. CircSTRN3 levels in HK2 cells and serum samples of patients were determined by RT-PCR. The protein levels of TLR4 (Toll Like Receptor 4), bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein), cleaved caspase 3 and bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) were detected by Western blotting (WB), and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA. The molecular interactions between mir-578\/TLR4 and circSTRN3\/miR-578 were analyzed by dual luciferase reporter assay as well as RNA pull-down experiment. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated HK2 cells were used as an in vitro model to investigate the functional interaction of circSTRN3\/miR-578\/TLR4 axis. We found that the expression level of circSTRN3 in patients with sepsis-induced AKI and LPS-induced HK2 cells was higher. Silencing cicrSTRN3 alleviated LPS-induced cell proliferation, and suppressed the inflammatory response and apoptosis in LPS-treated HK2 cells. In contrast, the overexpression of circSTRN3 aggravated the cellular damages induced by LPS treatment. CircSTRN3 targeted miR-578\/TLR4 axis to influence the damage effect induced by LPS. miR-578 inhibitor or TLR4 overexpression impaired the rescue effect of circSTRN3 knockdown. These results indicate that circSTRN3 upregulation in sepsis-induced AKI modulates miR-578\/TLR4 axis to promote the pathogenesis of AKI, which could serve as future therapeutic targets for AKI treatment.","9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common retinal microvascular diseases in diabetic patients. Therefore, elucidating the underlying molecular mechanism of DR is of great significance for its clinical treatment. This study explores the effects of the upregulated circFTO in DR patients in terms of cell apoptosis and viability. Several molecular assays are employed to explore these molecular mechanistic aspects, such as luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down, RT-qPCR, Western blot, and ELISA assays. miR-148a-3p is downregulated in DR patients. The expression of circFTO promoted ARPE-19 cells apoptosis and inhibited proliferation, reflecting the regulatory effect of circFTO\/miR-148a-3p on retinal epithelial cells injury. In addition, the absence of circFTO could reduce ARPE-19 cells injury caused by HG by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation. Further, the investigations at the molecular level showed that circFTO could regulate the level of miR-148a-3p and TGFA in vitro. As the molecular sponge of miR-148a-3p, circFTO regulated cell viability and apoptosis and promoted the progression of DR through regulating the expression of TGFA. Together, this study provides new targets and markers for early diagnosis and therapy of DR.","14":null,"15":"Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a severe form of respiratory failure associated with high mortality among children. The objective of this study is reported to explore the clinical function and molecular roles of microRNA-101-3p (miR-101-3p) in PARDS. The levels of miR-101-3p and mRNA levels of SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (Sox9) were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, the diagnostic role of miR-101-3p was identified by using the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry. To detect inflammation in cells, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed. The target gene of miR-101-3p was confirmed through data obtained from the luciferase activity. In patients with PARDS, miR-101-3p expression was decreased. Moderate and severe PARDS patients had lower levels of miR-101-3p than mild PARDS patients. The inflammatory progression was related to the aberrant expression of miR-101-3p in all PARDS children. MiR-101-3p was highly predictive for the detection of children with PARDS. In addition, miR-101-3p might protect A549 cells from abnormal proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Sox9 might be a target gene of miR-101-3p and increased mRNA expression of Sox9 in LPS-treated A549 cells was inhibited by overexpression of miR-101-3p. Ultimately, this study suggested that reduced expression of miR-101-3p plays a role in PARDS, providing a novel angle to study the disease.","16":null,"17":"Immune evasion is the process that tumor cells accelerate growth and metastasis by evading the recognition and attack of immune cells. SNF5 is one of the core subunits of SWI\/SNF, which is involved in the development of a variety of malignancies. However, the functions of SNF5 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and the mechanism of SNF5 regulates immune evasion are still unclear. Based on this, we analyzed the expression of SNF5 and overall survival of lung cancer tissues through the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. Then we performed genetic gain and loss of function experiments with SNF5 using lentivirus infection and siRNA in NSCLC A549 and NCI-H1299 cells, respectively. We investigated the proliferation and immune evasion of these cells. We further explored the mechanism of SNF5 on NSCLC cells immune evasion. Our data showed that SNF5 was significantly increased in lung cancer tissues than that in normal lung tissues. Furthermore, SNF5 promoted NSCLC cells proliferation and the expressions of immune evasion-related genes. Meantime, overexpressed SNF5 reduced mortality of A549 cells when co-cultured with T cells. Moreover, SNF5 regulated the immune evasion by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3)\/ phospho-STAT3 pathway in NSCLC cells. Together, our results validate SNF5 as a tumor oncogene and provide a new target for NSCLC treatment.","18":null,"19":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an essential role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We aimed to demonstrate the effects of lncRNA gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 1 (BBOX1)-antisense RNA 1 (AS1) in OSCC and its regulatory mechanisms. The levels of BBOX1-AS1, microRNA (miR)-3940-3p, and laminin subunit gamma 2 (LAMC2) in OSCC were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The correlations among BBOX1-AS1, miR-3940-3p, and LAMC2 were validated using luciferase, pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were examined. BBOX1-AS1 and LAMC2 were notably overexpressed in OSCC, while miR-3940-3p showed the opposite trend. BBOX-1-AS1 silencing reduced the cell proliferation and migration, while promoting apoptosis. Mechanistically, BBOX1-AS1 modulates LAMC2 expression by competitively binding to miR-3940-3p. miR-3940-3p inhibition alleviated the inhibitory effects of BBOX1-AS1 deficiency on OSCC development. LAMC2 knockdown reversed these changes. Our results revealed that BBOX1-AS1 promotes the malignant phenotype of OSCC cells via the upregulation of LAMC2 expression by targeting miR-3940-3p, indicating that BBOX1-AS1 may be a novel target for OSCC intervention.","20":"Unlike other types of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) does not respond to therapies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) or hormone therapy, and the prognosis of patients with TNBC is usually poor. The role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) small nucleolar RNA host gene 10 (SNHG10) has been investigated in many types of cancer, but its role in TNBC is unknown. This study aimed to explore the role of SNHG10 in TNBC in the context of doxorubicin treatment, a common therapy for TNBC. Analysis of the TCGA dataset revealed the downregulation of SNHG10 in TNBC. The downregulation of SNHG10 of TNBC in TNBC was further confirmed by detecting its expression in 60 patients with TNBC by qPCR. The expression of SNHG10 was further downregulated after doxorubicin treatment. In TNBC, microRNA-302b (miR-302b) was downregulated and was positively correlated with SNHG10. In TNBC cells, overexpression of SNHG10 resulted in upregulation of miR-302b, and methylation-specific PCR analysis showed that SNHG10 negatively regulates the methylation of miR-302b. In addition, doxorubicin treatment resulted in the downregulation of SNHG10 in TNBC cells, and overexpression of SNHG10 and miR-302b promoted apoptosis of doxorubicin-treated TNBC cells. Furthermore, overexpression of both SNHG10 and miR-302b had a stronger effect on apoptosis than that of overexpression of SNHG10 alone. Our study showed that SNHG10 could inhibit the development of resistance to doxorubicin by upregulating miR-302b in TNBC through methylation. Our findings suggested that SNHG10 might serve as a molecular target for intervening in TBNC metastasis.","21":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant cancer with severely poor survival, and the cells continue to thrive during hypoxia and toxic stress through autophagy. To validate the oncogenic role of long noncoding RNA H19 in GBM progression and examine whether autophagy and\/or miR-491-5p participate in the process. The expression of H19 and autophagy-related genes in GBM and healthy control tissues was assessed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy were respectively determined via cell counting kit-8 assay, clone formation assay, flow cytometry, western blotting and green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha fluorescence analysis in vitro. Furthermore, a rescue assay was performed using rapamycin or miR-491-5p antagomir to examine the role of autophagy or miR-491-5p in H19-mediated regulation of proliferation and apoptosis. RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter assays were employed to analyze the interaction between H19 and miR-491-5p. Additionally, tumor growth in a xenograft-bearing mouse model and autophagy in tumor mass were analyzed in vivo. The expression H19 was increased in GBM and was positively correlated with LC3 or Beclin-1. Silencing H19 inhibited growth and promoted apoptosis in GBM cells both in vitro and in vivo, and miR-491-5p was identified as one of the important mediators. H19 regulated the autophagy signaling pathway at least partly via miR-491-5p. Increased H19 expression in GBM exerts oncogenic effects by sponging miR-491-5p and enhancing autophagy. Therefore, H19 may be explored as a target for GBM therapy.","22":null,"23":"As a multifactorial disease, intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) causes many spinal-related diseases, which causes disability in the workforce and heavy social costs all over the world. Recently, Ganoderic Acid A (GAA) has been reported to play many pharmacological effects. However, its effect on IVDD remains unclear. In the present study, our study determined that GAA significantly inhibited H2O2 induced apoptosis, release of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress mediators in the nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Moreover, GAA also suppressed H2O2 induced major matrix degrading proteases (MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5) associated with NP degradation. Additionally, we found NP protective ability of GAA by up-regulating extra cellular matrix anabolic factors like type II collagen (Col II) and aggrecan in NP cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that GAA suppressed the activation of TLR4\/NLRP3 in H2O2-stimulated NP cells. Thus, our results demonstrate that GAA inhibited the H2O2 induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses through the depression of TLR4\/NLRP3 signaling axis. GAA possess NP protective properties and may be of value in suppressing the pathogenesis of IVDD.","24":"Glioma originated from excessively proliferative and highly invaded glial cells is a common intracranial malignant tumor with poor prognosis. Resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) is a clinical challenge in glioma treatment due to the fact that chemoresistance remains a main obstacle in the improvement of drug efficacy. Salvianolic acid A (Sal A), originated from traditional Chinese herbal medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza, possesses anti-tumor effects and could facilitate the delivery of drugs to brain tumor tissues. In the present work, effects of Sal A on the viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of human glioma cell line U87 cells as well as influence of Sal A on TMZ resistance were measured, so as to identify the biological function of Sal A in the malignant behaviors and chemoresistance of glioma cells. Additionally, activation of TAGLN2\/PI3K\/Akt pathway in glioma cells was also detected to investigate whether Sal A could regulate TAGLN2\/PI3K\/Akt to manipulate the progression of glioma and TMZ resistance. Results discovered that Sal A treatment reduced the viability, repressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells as well as promoted the apoptosis of glioma cells. Besides, Sal A treatment suppressed TAGLN2\/PI3K\/Akt pathway in glioma cells. Sal A treatment strengthened the suppressing effect of TMZ on glioma cell proliferation and reinforced the promoting effect of TMZ on glioma cell apoptosis, which were abolished by upregulation of TAGLN2. To conclude, Sal A treatment could suppress the malignant behaviors of glioma cells and improve TMZ sensitivity through inactivating TAGLN2\/PI3K\/Akt pathway.","25":"Stroke is the central disorder underlined by ischemia-reperfusion (I\/R) injury. Eleutheroside E (EE) is administered as the shield in some ischemia tissues with anti-inflammatory action. However, whether EE defends I\/R-induced damage in the brain remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that EE significantly alleviated the cerebral I\/R injury and reduced the apoptosis of hippocampal neuron cells in rats. During the anti-apoptosis process, EE significantly upregulated the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (Htr2c) gene. Silencing Htr2c expression dramatically weakened the protective effect of EE on I\/R-induced apoptosis of rat hippocampal neuron. EE-regulated Htr2c also remarkably inhibited the expression of caspase-3, -6 and -7, thereby suggesting a plausible anti-apoptosis mechanism associated with Htr2c\/caspase axis. These findings elicit the potentially clinical strategy that targets Htr2c to improve outcome of ischemia brain.","26":"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a common malignancy in head and neck. Circular SHKBP1 (circSHKBP) exerts momentous functions in the occurrence of many cancers including LSCC. Thus, we investigated the oncogenic capacities of circSHKBP1 in LSCC, and revealed the underlying mechanism as a competing endogenous RNA. The expression levels of circSHKBP1, miR-766-5p, and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) were examined by quantitative real-time PCR and their influences on the overall survival were measured by Kaplan-Meier method. The correlations between circSHKBP1 and miR-766-5p or HMGA2 were detected by Spearman's rank correlation analysis. In vitro, the influences of circSHKBP1\/miR-766-5p\/HMGA2 axis on the tumorigenesis of LSCC were examined by CCK-8, transwell, sphere formation, and angiogenesis assays, respectively. circSHKBP1 expression was up-regulated in the LSCC specimens and cell lines. And elevated circSHKBP1 expression was closely linked to poor prognosis. Silencing circSHKBP1 expression restrained cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, stem cell-like properties and tumor growth. We observed that miR-766-5p was down-regulated and negatively correlated to circSHKBP1 in LSCC samples. However, HMGA2 was highly expressed and positively associated with circSHKBP1 in these specimens. Importantly, the levels of circSHKBP1, miR-766-5p, and HMGA2 were closely associated with patients' clinical parameters including lymph nodes metastasis and TNM stages. Mechanistic analysis clarified that circSHKBP1 sponged miR-766-5p to regulate HMGA2, the target of miR-766-5p. Moreover, miR-766-5p inhibition and overexpression of HMGA2 rescued the tumor-suppressing roles of circSHKBP1 downregulation in LSCC. In conclusion, circSHKBP1 accelerated the tumorigenesis of LSCC via modulating HMGA2 by targeting miR-766-5p.","27":"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification acts as the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNA. Emerging evidence shows the critical biological roles of m6A key enzymes in human cancers. However, the roles of m6A binding protein IGF2BP2 in gastric cancer (GC) progression are still unclear. In this study, we confirmed that IGF2BP2 was highly expressed in GC cell lines and tumor tissues. Knocking down of IGF2BP2 suppressed cell proliferation and migration, and repressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo, while IGF2BP2 overexpression promoted the proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, we identified that IGF2BP2 regulated GC the proliferation\/migration through recognizing the m6A modification sites of SIRT1 mRNA. In general, our findings demonstrated a novel regulatory mechanism that IGF2BP2\/SIRT1 axis modulated GC progression in an m6A-dependent manner, suggesting that m6A may be a therapeutic target for GC.","28":"Colon cancer is among the most prevalent gastrointestinal tumor types. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) T cell leukemia homeobox 1 neighbor (TLX1NB) is up-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the functional role of this lncRNA in colon cancer remains unknown. In our study, we investigated the clinical significance of TLX1NB in colon cancer through bioinformatics analysis and explored its role in migration, invasion and metastasis of colon cancer cell with a series of experiments. Firstly, TLX1NB was up-regulated in colon cancer tissues and increased TLX1NB expression was significantly associated with advanced N stages. In wound healing assays and transwell assays, TLX1NB overexpression promoted HCT116 cell migration and invasion while TLX1NB knockdown inhibited SW620 cell migration and invasion. In vivo, TLX1NB knockdown suppressed pulmonary metastasis of SW620 cell and vimentin expression but increased E-cadherin expression. Then, TLX1NB overexpression enhanced signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A) phosphorylation and TLX1NB knockdown suppressed STAT5A phosphorylation. Moreover, the inhibition of STAT5A phosphorylation reversed TLX1NB overexpression-associated increase in HCT116 cell migratory and invasive activity. In conclusion, TLX1NB enhances STAT5A phosphorylation to promote colon cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis.","29":null,"30":null,"31":"Chemoresistance is a major challenge for the treatment of breast cancer (BC). Previous studies showed that miR-145 level decreases in chemoresistant BC tissues. Nevertheless, the biological function of miR-145 on docetaxel resistance of BC cells remains unclear, which is what our research attempted to clarify. RT-qPCR analyzed miR-145 level, and cell viability and colony formation assays assessed the impact of miR-145 on docetaxel resistance. Molecular mechanisms of miR-145-mediated docetaxel sensitivity were examined by Luciferase reporter assay and Western Blot assessed the function of AKT3 and PI3K\/AKT signaling. Our research found that miR-145 expression presented significant downregulation in docetaxel-resistant BC cells. Meanwhile, miR-145 overexpression facilitated the docetaxel sensitivity of BC cells in vivo and in vitro, while the miR-145 inhibitor decreased the sensitivity of BC cells to docetaxel. We also observed that miR-145 inhibited docetaxel resistance mainly via downregulation of the AKT3 expression and further inhibited PI3K\/AKT pathway. To conclude, this research provides a novel strategy for improving chemosensitivity through the newly identified miR-145-AKT3\/PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in BC.","32":"The tumor microenvironment (TME) and activated angiogenesis in thyroid carcinoma (TC) are critical for tumor growth and metastasis. Nuclear receptor binding protein 2 (NRBP2) has been suggested as a tumor suppressor. This study examines the function of NRBP2 in the progression of TC and the regulatory mechanism. By analyzing bioinformatic tools including GSE165724 dataset and the Cancer Genome Atlas system, we predicted NRBP2 as a poorly expressed gene in TC. Decreased NRBP2 expression was detected in TC tumor tissues and cells. Poor expression of NRBP2 was linked to unfavorable prognosis of patients. GATA binding protein 1 (GATA1) was found as a negative regulator of NRBP2. It recruited histone deacetylase2 (HDAC2) to the NRBP2 promoter to trigger histone deacetylation. NRBP2 overexpression suppressed growth of TC cells, and it reduced expression of TME markers, M2 polarization of macrophages, and angiogenesis in TC. Similar results were reproduced in vivo in nude mice. However, the anti-oncogenic roles of NRBP2 were blocked after further overexpression of GATA1 or HDAC2. In summary, this study demonstrates that GATA1 recruits HDAC2 to the NRBP2 promoter and enhances the TME and angiogenesis in TC cells.","33":null,"34":"The purpose of this study was to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of excess homocysteine in relation to autophagic activity in the ovarian tissue of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) with hyperandrogenism.A PCOS model was constructed using ICR mice. ELISA was used to detect the Hcy levels in the serum and ovarian tissues of PCOS model. The expression level of key enzymes (Methionine synthase and Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, MTR and BHMT) in homocysteine metabolism and autophagy-related proteins were detected in ovarian tissues and mouse granulosa cells (mGCs) that were treated with homocysteine, androgen, autophagy inhibitors or BHMT-expressing plasmid by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Electron microscope experiments were used to evaluate autophagosomes in Hcy-treated mGCs. The prenatally androgenized (PNA) PCOS mouse model showed hyperhomocysteinemia and hyperandrogenism. Homocysteine levels displayed a significant increase, while its metabolic enzymes levels were significantly decreased in ovarian tissues of PCOS mice and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-stimulated mGCs. The LC3II and Beclin1 expression levels were increased and the P62 and p-mTOR levels were decreased in vivo in ovarian tissue from the PCOS mice. The in vitro data were similarly with the in vivo by stimulation of mGCs with DHT or homocysteine. These effects could be diminished by the autophagy inhibitor (MHY1485), androgen receptor antagonists (ARN509) or BHMT-expressing plasmid. Androgen increases homocysteine concentration by downregulating the key enzymes in homocysteine metabolism. And then Hcy promotes GCs autophagy via the mTOR signal pathway.","35":"It is known that long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 00707 (LINC00707) promotes lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injury and microRNA-199-3p (miR-199-3p) regulates chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Both processes participate in osteoarthritis (OA). We predicted that LINC00707 and miR-199-3p may interact with each other. Therefore, LINC00707 and miR-199-3p may interact with each other to participate in OA. In this study, the expression of LINC00707 and miR-199-3p in both OA and normal articular cartilage tissues was analyzed using RT-qPCR. The subcellular location of LINC00707 and its direct interaction with miR-199-3p were explored by nuclear fractionation assay, RNA pull-down assay and Luciferase reporter assay, respectively. The role of LINC00707 and miR-199-3p in regulating the expression of each other was analyzed using an overexpression assay, followed by RT-qPCR. The role of LINC00707 and miR-199-3p in regulating OA chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis was analyzed by BrdU assay and cell apoptosis assay, respectively. OA tissues exhibited increased expression of LINC00707 and decreased expression of miR-199-3p. LINC00707 directly interacted with miR-199-3p in cytoplasm. However, LINC00707 and miR-199-3p overexpression failed to affect each other's expression. LPS treatment increased LINC00707 expression and decreased miR-199-3p expression in OA chondrocyte. LINC00707 overexpression increased the apoptosis of OA chondrocytes induced by LPS and suppressed the proliferation of OA chondrocytes. Moreover, LINC00707 suppressed the role of miR-199-3p in enhancing cell proliferation and suppressing cell apoptosis. In conclusion, LINC00707 can be detected in cytoplasm and it may sponge miR-199-3p to regulate chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis in OA.","36":null,"37":null,"38":"This study was aimed to investigate the influence of miR-33-5p on the M1\/M2 polarization of microglia and the underlying mechanism. Transcriptome sequencing was performed using microglia from miR-33-5p mimic and control groups.

The subnetwork of module A, which was extracted from the protein-protein interaction networks, mainly contained the downregulated genes. Cdk1,Ccnb,and Cdc20, the members of module-A networks with the highest degrees, possess the potential of being biomarkers of ischemic stroke due to their function in the cell cycle. NFY, a transcription factor, was predicted to have the regulatory relation with nine downregulated genes.

Aberrant proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in renal interstitial fibroblasts are key pathological causes of renal fibrosis. However, the mechanism underlying lead-induced kidney fibrosis remains unclear. The present study analyzed gene expression prolifes in lead acetate-treated primary mice renal interstitial fibroblasts and confirmed the aberrant expression of CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 20, one of the most obvious up-regulated genes. Analogously, lead acetate exposure dose-dependently increased CCL20 transcription, protein expression and release. Knockdown of CCL20 suppressed lead acetate-induced fibroblast proliferation, hydroxyproline contents, transforming growth factor-beta production and ECM-related protein (Collagen I and fibronectin) expression. Bioinformatics analysis predicted five top miRNAs targeting CCL20. Among them, miR-143-5p expression was dose-dependently decreased in lead acetate-treated fibroblasts. Mechanistically, miR-143-5p directly targeted CCL20. Elevation of miR-143-5p antagonized lead acetate-induced fibroblast proliferation, hydroxyproline and ECM-related protein expression, which were reversed by CCL20 overexpression. Additionally, CCL20 knockdown suppressed lead acetate-mediated Smad2\/3 and AKT pathway activation. Notably, miR-143-5p overexpression attenuated the activation of the Smad2\/3 and AKT pathway in lead acetate-exposed fibroblasts, which was counteracted by CCL20 elevation. miR-143-5p injection ameliorated renal fibrosis progression in mice in vivo. Thus, targeting CCL20 by miR-143-5p could alleviate renal fibrosis progression by regulating fibroblast proliferation and ECM deposition via the Smad2\/3 and AKT signaling, providing a potential therapeutic target for environmental lead contamination-evoked fibrotic kidney disease.","40":null,"41":null,"42":"Endothelial dysfunction is an initial and essential step in vascular-remodeling diseases, including atherosclerosis and neointima formation. During vascular remodeling, activated endothelial cells can release pro-inflammatory factors that promote phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to the proliferative phenotype. We previously reported that MEK1\/2 inhibitor, U0126, has a protective effect on the development of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. However, the effect of MEK1\/2 inhibitors on neointimal formation and the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We determined that MEK1\/2 inhibitor reduced carotid artery ligation-induced neointimal formation, while increased collagen and elastin levels and vascular integrality. Mechanistically, MEK1\/2 inhibitor or ERK1\/2 siRNA increased miR-126-3p level in endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting expression of regular of G-protein signaling 16 (RGS16), a miR-126-3p target gene, to activate the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)\/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) signaling pathway. Accordingly, miR-126-3p was also increased by U0126 in serum and carotid artery. RGS16 was inhibited while CXCR4 and CXCL12 was increased by U0126 in neointimal areas, especially in the endothelium. Moreover, similar results were observed in atherosclerotic plaques of high-fat diet-fed apolipoprotein E deficiency (apoE-\/-) mice. In addition, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), another miR-126-3p target gene, was reduced by U0126 in the neointimal areas, resulting reduced monocytes\/macrophages accumulation. Taken together, our results indicate that MEK1\/2 inhibitor can reduce neointima formation by activating endothelial miR-126-3p production to facilitate endothelium repair while reduce monocyte adhesion\/infiltration.","43":"As a malignant tumor, HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) is featured by a high recurrence rate with a poor prognosis. Increasing evidence supports an important role of lincRNAs in HCC. Here, the purpose of the study was to explore the function of LINC00978 (long non-coding RNA00978) in HCC and the underlying mechanisms. LINC00978 expression and its association with the progression of HCC were analyzed using HCC TCGA datasets. LINC00978 expression in tissues was measured using real-time PCR. Then, we knocked down LINC00978 in HCC cells to explore its effect on cellular invasion, proliferation, and migration. Finally, we investigated the potential molecular mechanism of LINC00978 by dual Luciferase reporter assay, FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) and RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation). LINC00978 expression was remarkably increased in HCC. A high level of LINC00978 was associated with poor prognosis of HCC. Additionally, LINC00978 silencing could repress the growth and metastasis of HCC cells. Mechanistically, it was revealed that LINC00978 could sponge microRNA-125b-5p and identified SOX12 (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 12) as a direct target gene of microRNA-125b-5p. More importantly, the suppressed effect of LINC00978 silencing on the metastasis and growth of HCC cells could be rescued by miR-125b-5p inhibition and overexpressed SOX12. LINC00978\/microRNA-125b-5p\/SOX12 axis promoted liver cancer migration, invasion, and proliferation, which could be used as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","44":null,"45":"Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of sudden death.

In this study, we integrated bioinformatics and molecular biological experiments to identify the novel lncRNA transcripts and elucidated its regulatory mechanism in MI. First, we identified 10 dysregualted lncRNAs and found that lncRNA Gm47283 was the top risk factor in MI. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that lncRNA Gm47283 exerted function via targeting miR-706 and Ptgs2. Ptgs2 was also the known regulator of ferroptosis. Inhibition or overexpression of lncRNA Gm47283 could regulate Ptgs2 expression and downstream ferroptosis activity. Overexpression of miR-706 could inhibit the expression of Ptgs2 and the activity of ferroptosis, thereby attenuated cellular injury. Mechanically, co-transfection experiments showed that overexpression of miR-706 could reverse the damage effect that was caused by lncRNA Gm47283 overexpression, via inhibiting Ptgs2 and ferroptosis. Additionally, inhibition of lncRNA Gm47283 by stem cell membrane coated siRNA could attenuate MI in vivo. Our study elucidated a novel mechanism containing lncRNA Gm47283\/miR-706\/Ptgs2\/ferroptosis in MI, which provided a potential therapeutic for MI.Graphical Abstract.

We aimed to study the role of circ_0003528 in HCC and its fundamental molecular mechanisms. HSA_circ_0003528 was identified through bioinformatics dataset analysis. The binding sites between mRNA and miRNA were predicted using online bioinformatics tools. The interaction between miR-212-3p and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) or circ_0003528 was confirmed through the luciferase reporter assay. RT-qPCR and western blot assays were used to analyze the expression of all miRNAs\/mRNAs and proteins. Cellular functions were evaluated using the MTT and TUNEL assays. A xenograft model was established to evaluate the function of circ_0003528 in vivo. Circ_0003528 was dramatically overexpressed in HepG2 and HUH7 cells. However, knockdown of circ_0003528 suppressed the aggressiveness of HCC cells and tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, binding of miR-212-3p to circ_0003528 and XIAP was verified. Downregulation of miR-212-3p abrogated the effects of si-circ_0003528 on cell viability and apoptosis, and upregulation of XIAP antagonized the functions of the miR-212-3p mimic in HCC cells. circ_0003528 contributes to the development of HCC in vitro and in vivo via the miR-212-3p\/XIAP axis. Hence, circ_0003528 knockdown may be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.","47":"As a novel noncoding RNA cluster, miR-17-92 cluster include six members: miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b-1, miR-20a, and miR-92a. Dysregulation of miR-17-92 has been proved to be connected with the advancement of a series of human diseases, but the roles of miR-17-92 cluster in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not been absolutely elaborated. Herein, we determined that miR-17-92 cluster were upregulated significantly in NSCLC tissues, and the cell proliferation, migration and cycle progression of NSCLC were also facilitated under the function of miR-17-92 cluster. Sprouty 4 (SPRY4) was a direct target of miR-92a, and its overexpression restrained the exacerbation of NSCLC induced by miR-92a. Furthermore, the tumor xenograft assay showed that miR-92a facilitated tumor growth by inhibiting the expression of SPRY4 and mediating Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in vivo. Finally, we looked into the synergistic effects of miR-92a and miR-18a on NSCLC, and found that antagomiR-18a treatment arrested the tumor growth rate of xenografted mice markedly.","48":"Ovarian cancers are the major cause of mortality for women worldwide. This study was aimed to elucidate the biological activities of CCDC106 in the proliferation and invasion of mutant p53 and of wild-type p53 ovarian cancer cells. CAOV3 (mutant p53) cells showed high expression levels of CCDC106, but it was expressed at low levels in SKOV3 (mutant p53) and in A2780 (wild-type p53) cells. The overexpression of CCDC106 promoted the expression of proliferation markers (cyclin family members), invasion and Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (claudin-1, claudin-4, N-cadherin, snail, slug) while the knockdown of CCDC106 inhibited their expression in mutant p53 cells but not in wild-type p53 cells. Treatment with a CK2 inhibitor blocked the translocation of CCDC106 into the nuclei of mutant p53 cells. Immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ATF4 is a potential binding partner of CCDC106. The overexpression of CCDC106 reduced p21 and p27 protein expression levels while treatment with an ATF4 siRNA rescued their expression. The overexpression of CCDC106 promoted colony formation and invasion of mutant p53 cells, which was suppressed by treatment with an ATF4 siRNA. Immunohistochemistry results showed that CCDC106 and ATF4 are expressed at high levels but p21 is expressed at low levels in FIGO III-IV stage and in mutant p53 ovarian cancer samples. A significant association between poor overall survival and high CCDC106 and ATF4 expression levels was observed in human ovarian cancer samples. In conclusion, CCDC106 promotes proliferation, invasion and EMT of mutant p53 ovarian cancer cells via the ATF4 mediated inhibition of p21.","49":null,"50":null,"51":"Thermal ablation is widely used in the treatment of lung cancer and is beneficial for the overall survival of patients in clinic. However, there is barely a priority in which ablation system should be chosen under different periods of tumor progression in lung cancer. The present study investigated different modes of thermal ablation systems in mice with transplanted Lewis lung carcinoma tumors and their various biological effects in local regions using untargeted metabolomics. The results showed that thermal ablation could significantly suppress tumor growth and the differentially expressed metabolites of tumors after ablation relative to untreated tumors concentrated on organic compounds, organic acids and derivatives, nucleosides, nucleotides, and lipids. The upregulated metabolites indicated an inflammatory reaction in the ablation groups at an early stage after ablation. Steroid hormone and tryptophan metabolism, which are associated with immune responses, were modulated after both cryoablation and hyperthermal ablation. Characteristically, the results also indicated that cryoablation suppressed glucose oxidation and carbohydrate metabolism of tumor, while hyperthermal ablation suppressed lipid metabolism of tumor. In conclusion, thermal ablation could inhibit tumor growth under either freezing or heating modes with characteristic different biological effects on tumors.","52":"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), with its increasing morbidity and mortality, has seriously and extensively affected the health of people worldwide. Caffeic Acid Dimethyl Ether (CADE) significantly inhibits alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis in vivo through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, but its in-depth mechanism remains unclear. This work aimed to clarify further mechanism of CADE in improving hepatic lipid accumulation in ALD through the microRNA-378b (miR-378b)-mediated Ca2+\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2)-AMPK signaling pathway. Here, we reported that the hepatic or serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were sharply escalated by ethanol while prominently decreased by CADE. Ethanol sharply up-regulated miR-378b expression while CADE effectively prevented the elevation of miR-378b in vivo. And treatment of CADE surely increased mRNA and protein expression of CaMKK2 as a kinase of AMPK and reduced lipid accumulation in the livers of alcohol-fed C57BL\/6 mice. MiR-378b escalation exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inhibited CaMKK2-AMPK signaling, while miR-378b deficiency alleviated lipid accumulation and activated the CaMKK2 cascade. Furthermore, CADE alleviated the lipid deposition and reversed the disorder of CaMKK2-AMPK signaling pathway induced by miR-378b over-expression. However, knockdown of miR-378b eliminated the beneficial effect of CADE on lipid metabolism. In brief, our results showed that CADE ultimately improved hepatic lipid deposition by regulating the CaMKK2-AMPK signaling pathway through miR-378b.","53":"Circular RNAs, which are a novel subclass of noncoding RNAs, are reported to be involved in various biological processes. Aberrant expression of circular RNAs may promote cancer progression. The function of circular GOLPH3 RNA (circGOLPH3) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is unclear. In this study, the circGOLPH3 levels in OSCC cell lines were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments were performed to evaluate the roles of circGOLPH3 in OSCC. Cell counting kit 8, migration, and invasion assays were performed to determine the functions of circGOLPH3. The mechanism of circGOLPH3 in OSCC was investigated using qRT-PCR, western blotting, luciferase activity, and RNA pull-down analyses. Furthermore, the function of circGOLPH3 in vivo was evaluated. circGOLPH3 derived from GOLPH3 was mainly localized to the cytoplasm and exhibited high stability. The expression of circGOLPH3 was upregulated in OSCC cells. circGOLPH3 promoted the growth of OSCC in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, circGOLPH3 upregulated OSCC cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, circGOLPH3 functioned as a microRNA sponge and downregulated miR-1299 expression. miR-1299 downregulated the expression of LIF by targeting its 3'-untranslated region. Inhibition of the circGOLPH3\/miR-1299\/LIF axis suppressed the growth, migration, and invasion of OSCC cells. These findings indicate that the circGOLPH3\/miR-1299\/LIF axis promotes OSCC cell growth, migration, and invasion and that this axis is a potential therapeutic target for OSCC.","54":null,"55":"Cataract is a global ophthalmic disease that blinds the eye, and oxidative stress is one of its primary causes. Apoptosis of lens epithelial cells (LECs) is considered the major cytological basis of many cataracts except congenital cataracts. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether diosmetin could reduce oxidative stress-induced damage to LECs, and explore its regulatory pathway. Lens epithelial cell line SRA01\/04 was used as the object of study. Using ultraviolet B (UVB) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as sources of oxidative stress, the protective effects of diosmetin at different concentrations on cells were investigated, including inhibition of proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Molecular docking was then used to predict the target proteins and validation was performed at the cellular and protein levels. The oxidative stress of SRA01\/04 was induced by UVB and H2O2, and inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis were observed. Here, diosmetin has a dose-dependent cell-protecting effect. This effect is achieved by targeting the MEK2 protein and inhibiting the MAPK signaling. In conclusion, diosmetin reduces H2O2- and UVB-induced inhibition of SRA01\/04 proliferation and apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress-induced activation of the MAPK pathway.","56":null,"57":"Radiation resistance largely limits the survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To understand the mechanism underlying radiation resistance, we explored the influence of LINC01578 in radiation-resistant NSCLC cells. LINC01578, miR-216b-5p and Transducin (beta)-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) expression was evaluated in patients with NSCLC, and their correlation with patients' prognosis was examined. Radiation-resistant NSCLC cell line (A549-RR) was induced and treated with oligonucleotide or plasmid transfection, and cell biological functions were captured. The interplay between LINC01578, miR-216b-5p and TBL1XR1 was clarified. NSCLC patients showed high LINC01578 and TBL1XR1 expression, and low miR-216b-5p expression, which was correlated to shorter patients' prognosis, respectively. LINC01578 or TBL1XR1 deficiency or miR-216b-5p elevation suppressed the functional activities of A549-RR cells. LINC01578 suppression elevated miR-216b-5p expression, consequently leading to the down-regulation of TBL1XR1. miR-216b-5p silencing or TBL1XR1 overexpression compromised LINC01578 knockdown's effects on radiation resistance of A549-RR cells. In brief, LINC01578 suppresses miR-216b-5p and enhances TBL1XR1 expression, thus to promote biological functions of radiation-resistant NSCLC cells.","58":null,"59":null,"60":"This study aimed to investigate whether and how long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MIR4435-2 host gene (MIR4435-2HG) involved in acute myocardial ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R). Blood samples were collected from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients to detect MIR4435-2HG expression. In vivo myocardial I\/R mice model and in vitro H2O2-induced oxidative stress model were established. Echocardiography, TUNEL assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) detection were performed to assess heart infarction and myocardium apoptosis. Relationship among microRNA-125a-5p (miR-125a-5p), MIR4435-2HG and Mitochondrial fission protein 1 (MTFP1) was predicted by Targetscan and verified by luciferase reporter assay. MIR4435-2HG was notably upregulated in AMI patients, myocardial I\/R mice and H2O2-treated cells. Knockdown of MIR4435-2HG notably alleviated infraction volume, ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) levels, cell apoptosis portion and pro-apoptotic cleaved-caspase-3 and Cyt c expression caused by myocardial I\/R and oxidative stress, as well as improved cardiomyocytes viability. Transfection with miR-125a-5p alleviated MIR4435-2HG-caused cardiomyocytes apoptosis during oxidative stress. MiR-125a-5p overexpression decreased luciferase activity of the wild-type MIR4435-2HG compared with the mutated MIR4435-2HG. The expression levels of MTFP1 were elevated in myocardium from MI mice model and H2O2-treated AC16 cardiomyocytes. In addition, miR-125a-5p overexpression inhibited MTFP1 expression, and could stimulate the wild-type MTFP1 promoter luciferase activity but not the mutated one. Our findings revealed the role of MIR4435-2HG in MI-induced myocardium injury and cardiomyocytes apoptosis, disclosed a novel MIR4435-2HG\/miR-125a-5p regulatory axis during myocardial I\/R, and thus identified a potential target for the therapy of myocardial IR injury.","61":null,"62":"Lung cancer is the most frequent malignancy, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is its most common pathological type. Molecular targeted therapy has been testified to be effective in intervening in the occurrence and development of malignancies. This study investigates the effect of lncRNA Regulatory Factor X3- antisense RNA 1 (RFX3-AS1) in NSCLC progression. The RFX3-AS1 profile in NSCLC tissues and cells was measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The RFX3-AS1 overexpression model was constructed. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) experiment and cell colony formation assay were adopted to test cell viability. The cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Cell migration and invasion were monitored by the Transwell assay, and Western blot was implemented to verify the protein profiles of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), E-cadherin, Vimentin and N-cadherin. In vivo, we validated the impact of RFX3-AS1 overexpression on the NSCLC xenograft mouse model. The targeting relationships between RFX3-AS1 and miR-577, miR-577 and STAT3 were confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results manifested that overexpressing RFX3-AS1 markedly facilitated NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and suppressed cell apoptosis. In contrast, miR-577, which was a downstream target of RFX3-AS1, dramatically impeded the malignant biological behaviors of NSCLC cells. STAT3 was a direct target of miR-577, and it was negatively regulated by the latter. STAT3 activation reversed miR-577-mediated anti-tumor roles. In brief, RFX3-AS1 aggravated NSCLC progression by regulating the miR-577\/STAT3 axis.","63":"CircMCTP2 is a novel circRNA, which is associated with various kinds of malignant tumors progression, such as gastric cancer. However, the function of circMCTP2 in bladder carcinoma (BC) has no idea. The purpose of this study was tantamount to functionally dissect circMCTP2 in the progression of BC. In our study, circMCTP2 expression was strongly increased in BC tissues and cell lines. High expression of circMCTP2 predicted a poor prognosis of BC patients. CircMCTP2 deficiency impaired the cell growth, migration as well as invasive ability of BC cell lines (J82 and T24). In vivo, circMCTP2 deficiency cut the tumor growth rates and the tumor weight. In BC cells, circMCTP2 deficiency enhanced the translation of E-cadherin, while diminishing the translation of N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail. Moreover, circMCTP2 acted as a sponge of miR-498 to regulate murine double minute-2 (MDM2) expression. In BC tissues, a negative correlation was observed between the expression levels of circMCTP2 and miR-498. Additionally, either miR-498 silencing or MDM2 over-expression augmented the carcinogenic action of circMCTP2 on BC. In conclusion, our study showed that circMCTP2 regulates the expression of MDM2 by sponging miR-498 to promote the development of BC. These findings offer a new strategy for early diagnosis of BC and its therapeutics.","64":"Mounting evidence supports that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may exert a vital function in multiple complications induced by diabetes. The aim of this research was to verify the function of ACE2 in diabetic angiopathy (DA). In our study, it was revealed that high glucose (HG) treatment impeded cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, ACE2 level was reduced in HG-stimulated HMEC-1 cells. Functional assays demonstrated that ACE2 addition promoted cell viability, suppressed apoptosis, oxidative stress, ROS generation, and inflammation in HG-stimulated HMEC-1 cells. Furthermore, the activation of the JAK2\/STAT3 pathway induced by HG was impeded by overexpression of ACE2. Besides, JAK2\/STAT3 pathway inhibitor AG490 reversed the changes of cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation caused by ACE2 deletion in HG-treated HMEC-1 cells. In sum, our findings highlighted that ACE2 promoted the viability and restrained the oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in HG-induced microvascular endothelial cells (VECs) injury via regulating the JAK2\/STAT3 pathway, suggesting ACE2 might be a potential therapeutic target for DA treatment.","65":"This study aimed to investigate the potential role of circRNA circ_0000080 in myocardial hypoxia injury and the underlying mechanisms. Patients with myocardial hypoxia injury who were admitted to Xi'an No. 1 Hospital, China, were included in this study.

In addition, the release of cytokines was determined by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the binding sites between miR-367-5p and circ_0000080\/COX2 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis and confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. circ_0000080 was upregulated in patients with MI and in H9c2 cells treated with H2O2 and hypoxia\/reoxygenation (H\/R). Silencing circ_0000080 reduced the H\/R-mediated apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, circ_0000080 functioned as an miR-367-5p sponge to regulate the expression of COX2.

The lncRNA FGD5-AS1 is a newly discovered lncRNA with a length of 3772 nucleotides. Studies have found that FGD5-AS1 is abnormally highly expressed in many cancer tissues and was closely related to the lymph node metastasis, tumor invasion, survival time, and recurrence rate of various cancers. Mechanistic analyses show that FGD5-AS1 can stabilize mRNA expression by sponging miRNA, which not only induces cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and chemoresistance in vitro, but also promotes tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. In addition, FGD5-AS1 can serve as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for a variety of cancers.

Fructus Ligustri Lucidi (FLL) has been widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis and other orthopedic diseases for thousands of years. However, whether FLL plays an anti-osteoporosis role in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, as well as its active components, targets, and specific molecular mechanisms, has not been fully elucidated. First, we obtained 13 active ingredients of FLL from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCSMP) database, and four active ingredients without any target were excluded. Subsequently, 102 common drug-disease targets were subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, Gene Oncology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. The results of the three analyses were highly consistent, indicating that FLL promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by activating the PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway. Finally, we validated previous predictions using in vitro experiments, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, alizarin red staining (ARS), and western blot analysis of osteogenic-related proteins. The organic combination of network pharmacological predictions with in vitro experimental validation comprehensively confirmed the reliability of FLL in promoting osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.

In this study, after treatment with different concentrations of Arctiin, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were used to estimate the expression of osteogenesis markers. Then, the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was detected by an ALP assay kit and calcium nodules staining was evaluated by alizarin red staining (ARS). Additionally, the regulatory effects of Arctiin on cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) was assessed by measurement of protein expression. Subsequently, the functions of Ccnd1 silencing on the osteogenic differentiation was examined in Arctiin-treated MC3T3-E1 cells. Results indicated that Arctiin dose-dependently upregulated the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), collagen type 1 (COL1A1), osteocalcin (OCN) and osteopontin (OPN). Elevated ALP activity and calcification degree was prominently observed in the Arctiin-treated groups. Moreover, Ccnd1 expression was notably enhanced after Arctiin intervention. Importantly, Ccnd1-knockdown abrogated the impacts of Arctiin on osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1. To conclude, findings in this study suggested that Arctiin could regulate MC3T3-E1 osteoblast differentiation via up-regulating Ccnd1, supporting that Arctiin might be a therapeutic target for osteoporosis.","74":"Curcumin, with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties, is widely used in the treatment of bone disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the effects of curcumin on fibroblast-like synoviocytes in RA and its underlying mechanism. mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression levels were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cellular functions were detected using cell counting kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, Transwell, and flow cytometric assays. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to measure the cytokine release. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expression levels. An in vivo assay was performed to verify the role of linc00052 in RA. Curcumin promoted apoptosis and inhibited the growth, migration, and invasion of RA fibroblast-like synovial (RAFLS) cells. Curcumin treatment suppressed the inflammatory response of RAFLS cells. Moreover, curcumin increased linc00052 levels, and linc00052 knockdown reversed the effects of curcumin. Additionally, linc00052 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA to upregulate the expression of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT 2 (PIAS2) by sponging miR-126-5p. Curcumin inhibited the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)\/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. In vivo assays showed that curcumin decreased the arthritis score and improved inflammatory infiltration and synovial cell proliferation. These results reveal that curcumin protects against RA by regulating the inc00052\/miR-126-5p\/PIAS2 axis through JAK2\/STAT3 signaling pathway.","75":"This study aimed to investigate the effects of luteolin on colorectal cancer (CRC) and explore its underlying mechanism. HCT-116 and HT-29 cells were treated with luteolin, cisplatin, or selumetinib. The cell survival, cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution, and DNA damage were detected using Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining analysis, respectively. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of apoptosis-related, cycle-related, DNA-damage-related, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-related proteins. Luteolin showed inhibitory effects on cellular growth by reducing cell survival and proliferation, inducing apoptosis and DNA damage, and arresting the cell cycle in a concentration-dependent manner in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells. Meanwhile, luteolin increased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, p-CHK1 (central to the induction of cell cycle arrest), and DNA excision repair protein and decreased anti-apoptotic proteins, G2-M phase-related proteins, and DNA repair proteins. The combination of cisplatin and luteolin significantly decreased cell survival and increased the apoptosis rate of HCT-116 and HT-29 cells compared with cisplatin alone. Bioinformatic analysis using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and STITCH and MalaCards databases showed that the MAPK pathway is involved in the pharmacology of luteolin. Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that luteolin plays an inhibitory role by suppressing the MAPK signaling pathway in CRC, which is enhanced when combined with selumetinib. Luteolin can also prevent tumourigenesis in CRC in vivo. In conclusion, luteolin suppressed cell proliferation, blocked the cell cycle, and induced DNA damage and apoptosis progression in CRC cells by mediating the MAPK pathway.","76":null,"77":"Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common malignant tumor and the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths.

H2AFY expression was correlated with poor prognosis of liver cancer patients. H2AFY expression was also significantly higher in liver cancer cells. Knockdown and overexpression of H2AFY in liver cancer cells showed that H2AFY promoted the proliferation and clone formation of liver cancer cells but had no significant effects on the migration and invasion ability of liver cancer cells. Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence double staining confirmed that H2AFY upregulated LC3 and p62 expression in liver cancer tissues and cells.

Reports indicate that tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are possible therapeutic targets and biomarkers for cancer treatment. Nonetheless, the effect of tRF-Leu-AAG on PC is unclear. This study aims to explore the role of tRF-Leu-AAG and upstream frameshift mutant 1 (UPF1) in the development of PC and its potential underlying mechanisms. High-throughput second-generation sequencing techniques were used to detect the expression of tRFs in cancerous and adjacent normal tissues from PC patients. The role of tRF-Leu-AAG proliferation in PC cells was investigated via the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay. The effect of tRF-Leu-AAG on the invasion and migration ability of PC cells was also determined by the transwell assay. Thereafter, the downstream target genes of tRF-Leu-AAG were comprehensively predicted using bioinformatics analysis databases. We also used the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay to assess the nexus between tRF-Leu-AAG and UPF1. Eventually, Western Blot was used to validate the expression of UPF1 in PC cells. A total of 33 tRF expressions significantly varied from PC patients. RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression of tRF-Leu-AAG was observably up-regulated in PC cells as compared to the control cells. Importantly, knockdown of tRF-Leu-AAG observably inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, according to the predicted frameshift database results, the UPF1 acted as downstream target genes for tRF-Leu-AAG and significantly down-regulated UPF1 expression.","97":"Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-tumor activity in kidney cancer. However, the efficacy of cabozantinib in other renal diseases has never been reported. Here, we focused on exploring the effect of cabozantinib on diabetic nephropathy (DN). The biofunctions of cabozantinib in human renal glomerular endothelial cells (hGECs) under high glucose conditions have been investigated. We found that cabozantinib ameliorated high glucose-induced oxidative stress in hGECs with decreased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity. Cabozantinib ameliorated high glucose-induced reduction in the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and the production of nitric oxide (NO) in hGECs. It also suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemokine protein 1 (MCP-1), against high glucose exposure in hGECs. Cabozantinib reduced the expression of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in high glucose-treated hGECs, while Egr-1 overexpression abolished the protective effects of cabozantinib against high glucose in hGECs. In conclusion, cabozantinib protected hGECs from high glucose-induced oxidative stress, NO deficiency, and inflammation via regulating Egr-1. These findings suggest that cabozantinib might be used as an adjuvant to control DN.","98":"As an endocrine and metabolic disorder, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is common in females at childbearing age. Our work was intended to uncover the underlying role of LINC00173 and its potential regulatory mechanism in PCOS based on two cell lines (PCOS granulosa cells and KGN cells) and an in vivo model established from Sprague Dawley rats. It was revealed that LINC00173 and JAG1 expressions were upregulated, while miR-124-3p was poorly expressed in PCOS patients and PCOS rats. Functional assays showed that LINC00173 overexpression repressed proliferation and stimulated apoptosis in granulosa cells and KGN cells, while LINC00173 downregulation exhibited the opposite effects. Besides, it was verified that LINC00173 upregulated JAG1 expression in KGN cells via competitively binding to miR-124-3p. Similarly, miR-124-3p abundance was inversely related to LINC00173 and JAG1 level in PCOS. Subsequently, rescue assays elucidated that miR-124-3p upregulation or downregulation eliminated the effects on KGN cell proliferation and apoptosis mediated by LINC00173 overexpression or knockdown. In addition, it was found that the JAG1 level in KGN cells was adversely modulated by miR-124-3p and positively modulated by LINC00173. Moreover, it was further demonstrated that the reduced cell vitality and increased apoptosis of KGN cells induced by overexpressing LINC00173 could be relieved by JAG1 deletion. These findings suggested that LINC00173 could be a latent regulating factor for PCOS progression via modulating the miR-124-3p\/JAG1 cascade.","99":"The scarcity of water resources and environmental pollution have highlighted the need for sustainable wastewater treatment. Existing conventional treatment systems are energy-intensive and not always able to meet stringent disposal standards. Recently, algal-bacterial systems have emerged as environmentally friendly sustainable processes for wastewater treatment and resource recovery. The algal-bacterial systems work on the principle of the symbiotic relationship between algae and bacteria. This paper comprehensively discusses the most recent studies on algal-bacterial systems for wastewater treatment, factors affecting the treatment, and aspects of resource recovery from the biomass. The algal-bacterial interaction includes cell-to-cell communication, substrate exchange, and horizontal gene transfer. The quorum sensing (QS) molecules and their effects on algal-bacterial interactions are briefly discussed. The effect of the factors such as pH, temperature, C\/N\/P ratio, light intensity, and external aeration on the algal-bacterial systems have been discussed. An overview of the modeling aspects of algal-bacterial systems has been provided. The algal-bacterial systems have the potential for removing micropollutants because of the diverse possible interactions between algae-bacteria. The removal mechanisms of micropollutants - sorption, biodegradation, and photodegradation, have been reviewed. The harvesting methods and resource recovery aspects have been presented. The major challenges associated with algal-bacterial systems for real scale implementation and future perspectives have been discussed. Integrating wastewater treatment with the algal biorefinery concept reduces the overall waste component in a wastewater treatment system by converting the biomass into a useful product, resulting in a sustainable system that contributes to the circular bioeconomy.","100":"Sulforaphane (SFP) treatment represses oxidative stress by activating NRF2. Meanwhile, SFP may also increase the production of nitric oxide (NO) and activate the signaling pathway of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is involved in the pathogenesis of hypoxic vestibular vertigo (HVV). However, it remains unknown as whether SFP plays a therapeutic role in the treatment of HVV. A rat model of HVV was established to measure the levels of escape latency, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the aorta tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of NRF2 mRNA, and Western blot and immunohistochemistry were carried out to analyze the expression of NRF2 protein. ELISA was used to examine the production of NO and cGMP. SFP treatment helped to maintain the escape latency and MDA, GSH, SOD concentrations in the brain of HVV rats, and recovered the expression of NRF2 inhibited in the brain of HVV rats. SFP treatment also elevated NO and cGMP production that was down-regulated in the brain of HVV rats. On the cellular level, SFP enhanced the expression of NRF2, reduced the concentrations of MDA, GSH and SOD, and promoted the production of NO and cGMP in a dose-dependent manner. In this study, we treated an animal model of HVV with SFP to investigate its effect on NO production and oxidative stress. Our work provided a mechanistic insight into the therapeutic effect of SFP on the treatment of HVV.","101":null,"102":null,"103":null,"104":"Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1833 (LINC01833) exhibits elevated expression in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues, while its molecular mechanism in NSCLC progression remains elusive. Herein, the proliferation, migration, invasion as well as apoptosis of NSCLC cells were assessed. The potential N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification site was predicted by the m6aVar tool. RNA pulldown and m6A-specific immunoprecipitation assays were used to detect the interaction between LINC01833 and methyltransferase 3, N6-adenosine-methyltransferase complex catalytic subunit (METTL3). RNA pull-down together with mass spectrometry were performed to assess the binding relationship between LINC01833 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2\/B1 (HNRNPA2B1) in NSCLC. Tumor xenograft mice model was established, and the tumor size and weight were measured. The results demonstrated that LINC01833 expression was elevated in NSCLC samples. Overexpression of LINC01833 promoted proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities and inhibited HCC827 cell apoptosis. LINC01833 knockdown inhibited tumor growth in mice. LINC01833 is further demonstrated to be modulated by METTL3, which is highly expressed in NSCLC samples. In addition, RNA pulldown and m6A-specific immunoprecipitation assays indicated that LINC01833 might form a complex with HNRNPA2B1. In conclusion, m6A transferase METTL3-induced LINC01833 m6A methylation promotes NSCLC progression through modulating HNRNPA2B1 expression. Our findings indicated that LINC01833 might be a therapeutic target for NSCLC.","105":"Xylanases are widely used in the degradation of lignocellulose and are important industrial enzymes. Therefore, increasing the catalytic activity of xylanases can improve their efficiency and performance. In this study, we introduced the C-terminal proline-rich oligopeptide of the rumen-derived XynA into XylR, a GH10 family xylanase. The optimum temperature and pH of the fused enzyme (XylR-Fu) were consistent with those of XylR; however, its catalytic efficiency was 2.48-fold higher than that of XylR. Although the proline-rich oligopeptide did not change the enzyme hydrolysis mode, the amount of oligosaccharides released from beechwood xylan by XylR-Fu was 17% higher than that released by XylR. This increase may be due to the abundance of proline in the oligopeptide, which plays an important role in substrate binding. Furthermore, circular dichroism analysis indicated that the proline-rich oligopeptide might increase the rigidity of the overall structure, thereby enhancing the affinity to the substrate and catalytic activity of the enzyme. Our study shows that the proline-rich oligopeptide enhances the catalytic efficiency of GH10 xylanases and provides a better understanding of the C-terminal oligopeptide-function relationships. This knowledge can guide the rational design of GH10 xylanases to improve their catalytic activity and provides clues for further applications of xylanases in industry.","106":"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) severely threatens the health of people owing to its lethality. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms on LUAD development remain unclear to a great extent. This work aimed to probe the functions of miR-218-5p in LUAD. MiR-218-5p and endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase 1 alpha (ERO1A) were screened as differently downregulated and upregulated RNAs in LUAD, respectively, by bioinformatics analyses. The results of cell functional assays stated that enforced expression of miR-218-5p notably restrained cell viability, invasion, and migration in LUAD. MiR-218-5p may interact with 3'-untranslated region of ERO1A mRNA as analyzed by bioinformatics. Afterward, western blot and dual-luciferase reporter gene analyses were introduced to identify their interaction. ERO1A overexpression reversed the suppressive impacts of miR-218-5p on LUAD cell progression, indicating the implication of miR-218-5p\/ERO1A axis in suppressing cancer development. We also observed that this regulatory axis suppressed angiogenesis in LUAD. Taken together, miR-218-5p\/ERO1A axis exerted an imperative role in LUAD cell progression, which provides a valuable clue for the development of LUAD therapeutic regimen.","107":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the carcinogenesis of lung cancer. Human MYC gene is highly expressed in melanoma, multiple myeloma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the role of circMYC in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The expression of cirMYC in SCLC tissues and cells were examined. Functional studies were performed to evaluate the roles of circMYC in SCLC cells. Luciferase reporter gene assay, RNA pull-down assay, and rescue experiments were performed to evaluate the regulatory relationship between circMYC and miR-145, and MiR-145 and MMP2 mRNA. We found that CirMYC was highly expressed in SCLC tissues and cells. Knockdown of circMYC could inhibit cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and induce apoptosis. CircMYC targeted miR-145 and miR-145 targeted MMP2 (Matrix Metallopeptidase 2) mRNA. Our data indicated that circMYC upregulates the expression of MMP-2 by inhibiting miR-145, which functions to promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibit the apoptosis of SCLC. These findings suggest that targeting circMYC\/miR-145\/MMP-2 could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for SCLC treatment.","108":"Recent studies have shown that circRNAs can act as oncogenic factors or tumor suppressors by sponging microRNAs (miRNAs). The upregulation of circ_0023984 was reported in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, its functional role in ESCC remain unclear. In the present study, circ_0023984 expression in ESCC cells and tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting (WB). Subcellular fraction experiment was performed to determine relative nuclear-cytoplasmic localization. The loss-of-function effects of circ_0023984 in ESCC cell lines were investigated by shRNA-mediated knockdown. Functional assays including cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU) incorporation, colony formation and Transwell migration assays were conducted to assess the malignant phenotype. The interaction between the two molecules was analyzed by RNA pull-down, luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). The subcutaneous tumor model in nude mice was used to assess the role of circ-0023984 in tumorigenesis. We found that ESCC patients with high circ_0023984 expression was associated with a poor prognosis. The knockdown of circ_0023984 suppressed cell growth, invasion, and migration in ESCC cells. Circ_0023984 interacted with miR-134-5p and inhibited its activity, which promoted the expression of CST4 (Cystatin-S). Circ_0023984 also regulated tumorigenesis in a CST4-dependent manner. Together, our study indicates that the oncogenic role of Circ_0023984 is mediated by miR-134-5p\/CST4 Axis in ESCC, which could serve as potential targets for future therapeutic strategies.","109":null,"110":"Studies have shown that periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a distinctive form of cerebral white matter injury that pertains to myelination disturbances. Maternal inflammation is a main cause of white matter injury. Intrauterine inflammation cellular will be propagated to the developing brain by the entire maternal-placental-fetal axis, and triggers neural immune injury. As a low-affinity receptor, adenosine A2B receptor (A2BAR) requires high concentrations of adenosine to be significantly activated in pathological conditions. We hypothesized that in the maternal inflammation-induced PVL model, a selective A2BAR antagonist PSB0788 had the potential to prevent the injury. In this work, a total of 18 SD pregnant rats were divided into three groups, and treated with intraperitoneal injection of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or LPS+PSB0788. Placental infection was determined by H&amp;E staining and the inflammatory condition was determined by ELISA. Change of MBP, NG2 and CC-1 in the brain of the rats' offspring were detected by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, LPS-induced maternal inflammation reduced the expression of MBP, which related to the decrease in the numbers of OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes in neonate rats. After treatment with PSB0788, the levels of MBP proteins increased in the rats' offspring, improved the remyelination. In conclusion, our study shows that the selective A2BAR antagonist PSB0788 plays an important role in promoting the normal development of OPCs in vivo by the maternal inflammation-induced PVL model. Future studies will focus on the mechanism of PSB0788 in this model.","111":null,"112":"The aim of this study was to investigate whether HUCMSCsWnt10b could promote long bone fracture healing. Commercially-available HUCMSCsEmp (human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transfected with empty vector) in hydrogel, HUCMSCsWnt10b in hydrogel and HUCMSCsWnt10b with the Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor IWR-1 were transplanted into the fracture site in a rat model of femoral fracture. We found that transplantation of HUCMSCsWnt10b significantly accelerated bone healing in a rat model of femoral fracture. Meanwhile, three-point bending test proved that the mechanical properties of the bone at the fracture site in the HUCMSCWnt10b treatment group were significantly better than those of the other treatment groups. To understand the cellular mechanism, we explored the viability of periosteal stem cells (PSCs), as they contribute the greatest number of osteoblast lineage cells to the callus. In line with in vivo data, we found that conditioned medium from HUCMSCsWnt10b enhanced the migration and osteogenic differentiation of PSCs. Furthermore, conditioned medium from HUCMSCsWnt10b also induced endothelial cells to form capillary-like structures in a tube formation assay, which was blocked by SU5416, an angiogenesis inhibitor, suggesting that enhanced vessel formation and growth also contribute to accelerated hard callus formation. In summary, our study demonstrates that HUCMSCsWnt10b promote fracture healing via accelerated hard callus formation, possibly due to enhanced osteogenic differentiation of PSCs and vessel growth. Therefore, HUCMSCsWnt10b may be a promising treatment for long bone fractures.","113":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy. Previous studies have found that lamin B1 (LMNB1) contributes to the development of human cancers. However, the biological functions and prognostic values of LMNB1 in HCC have not been adequately elucidated. In our present research, the expression pattern of LMNB1 was analyzed. The prognostic values of LMNB1 were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The effects of LMNB1 on HCC progression were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, wound healing, Transwell and in vivo xenograft assays. The mechanisms of LMNB1 in HCC progression were elucidated by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and loss-of-function assays. Besides, a nomogram for predicting overall survival (OS) was constructed. The results demonstrated that LMNB1 was overexpressed in HCC and that increased LMNB1 expression predicted a dismal prognosis. Further experiments showed that LMNB1 facilitated cell proliferation and metastasis in HCC. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that LMNB1 modulated metastasis-associated biological functions such as focal adhesion, extracellular matrix, cell junctions and cell adhesion. Mechanistically, we revealed that LMNB1 promoted HCC progression by regulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Moreover, incorporating LMNB1, Ki67 and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage into a nomogram showed better predictive accuracy than the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage and BCLC stage. In conclusion, LMNB1 may serve as an effective therapeutic target as well as a reliable prognostic biomarker for HCC.","114":null,"115":"To discuss the effect and molecular mechanism of circular RNA circ_0067741 on the occurrence and development of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). QRT-PCR was utilized to detect circ_0067741, microRNA-183-5p (miR-183-5p) and large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) expressions in tumor tissues of 30 LUAD patients and LUAD cell lines (A549, Calu-3, H1299 and H1975). After overexpression or knockdown of circ_0067741-1 or miR-183-5p in H1299 and A549 cells, respectively, cell proliferation, viability, apoptosis, invasion and migration ability and angiogenesis ability were detected by MTT, cell cloning, flow cytometry, transwell and tube formation assays, respectively. The targeted relationship between miR-183-5p and circ_0067741 or LATS1 was validated using dual-luciferase reporter assay. We found that circ_0067741 expression was notably declined in LUAD cells and tissues. Overexpression of circ_0067741 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of LUAD cells and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, circ_0067741 could sponge miR-183-5p to regulate LATS1 expression and then activate the Hippo\/YAP pathway. Downregulation of LATS1 reversed the effects of circ_0067741 on the Hippo\/YAP pathway and LUAD cells progression. In conclusion, circ_0067741 sponges miR-183-5p, and regulates LATS1 to activate Hippo\/YAP pathway, thereby inhibiting the process of LUAD cells. And the circ_0067741\/miR-183-5p\/LATS1 axis can be a potential target for early diagnosis and targeted treatment of LUAD.","116":null,"117":"The present study is targeted at investigating the effects of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 847 (LINC00847) on the malignant biological behaviors of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cells, and the mechanisms.

BrdU, cell counting kit-8, scratch wound healing, Transwell and flow cytometry assays were utilized for detecting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle progression. Dual-luciferase reporter gene, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down assays were utilized to investigate the interaction among LINC00847, miR-181a-5p, and ZEB2. The subcellular location of LINC00847 was determined by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) assay. Tumor growth was evaluated using a xenograft model of nude mice. It was revealed that LINC00847 expression was increased in LSCC tissues, and its high expression was associated with lymph node metastasis and poor differentiation. LINC00847 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of LSCC cells, and LINC00847 overexpression promoted LSCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and accelerated the cell cycle progression while knocking down LINC00847 had the opposite effects in vitro and inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. LINC00847 directly targeted miR-181a-5p and negatively modulated miR-181a-5p expression. ZEB2 was a target gene of miR-181a-5p, and was positively and indirectly modulated by LINC00847. Our data suggest that LINC00847 promotes LSCC progression by regulating the miR-181a-5p\/ZEB2 axis.","118":"Owing to various undesirable health effects of sugar overconsumption, joint efforts are being made by industrial sectors and regulatory authorities to reduce sugar consumption practices, worldwide. Artificial sweeteners are considered potential substitutes in several products, e.g., sugar alcohols (polyols), high-fructose corn syrup, powdered drink mixes, and other beverages. Nevertheless, their long-standing health effects continue to be debatable. Consequently, growing interest has been shifted in producing non-caloric sweetenersfrom renewable resources to meet consumers' dietary requirements. Except for the lysozyme protein, various sweet proteins including thaumatin, mabinlin, brazzein, monellin, miraculin, pentadin, and curculin have been identified in tropical plants. Given the high cost and challenging extortion of natural resources, producing these sweet proteins using engineered microbial hosts, such as Yarrowia lipolytica, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha, Candida boidinii, Arxula adeninivorans, Pichia methanolica, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Kluyveromyces lactis represents an appealing choice. Engineering techniques can be applied for large-scale biosynthesis of proteins, which can be used in biopharmaceutical, food, diagnostic, and medicine industries. Nevertheless, extensive work needs to be undertaken to address technical challenges in microbial production of sweet-tasting proteins in bulk. This review spotlights historical aspects, physicochemical properties (taste, safety, stability, solubility, and cost), and recombinant biosynthesis of sweet proteins. Moreover, future opportunities for process improvement based on metabolic engineering strategies are also discussed.","119":"Increasing evidence suggests that plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) plays a vital role in the development of multiple tumors including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-3 (EIF4A3) is considered a key factor in human cancers. However, the role and potential mechanism of PVT1 combined with EIF4A3 in LUAD remain unclear. This study investigated the effects and regulatory mechanisms of PVT1, EIF4A3, and circLMNB2 on the growth, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of LUAD cells (H1299 and HCC827 cells) The expression level, diagnostic value and prognostic significance of PVT1, EIF4A3, and circLMNB2 were assessed, and enrichment analysis was performed using R package. Rescue experiments and a xenograft model were used to validate the PVT1\/EIF4A3\/circLMNB2 axis in LUAD. PVT1 and EIF4A3 were upregulated and indicated poor prognosis in LUAD. Knockdown of PVT1 and EIF4A3 suppressed LUAD cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT. Mechanistically, PVT1 was stabilized by EIF4A3. PVT1 could recruit EIF4A3 to promote circLMNB2 expression. Rescue experiments indicated that circLMNB2 overexpression could reverse the reduced behavior caused by PVT1 or EIF4A3 knockdown. Enrichment analysis showed that PVT1\/EIF4A3\/circLMNB2 may regulate LUAD development by participating in ribosome biogenesis and spliceosome formation. Our findings demonstrate that PVT1\/EIF4A3\/circLMNB2 enhances the malignant behaviors of LUAD cells, providing a novel perspective for the clinical treatment of LUAD.","120":"Emerging studies show that circRNA catenin beta 1 (circCTNNB1) plays a critical role in cancer. However, the expression and function of circCTNNB1 in cerebral ischemia\/reperfusion injury (IRI) have not been reported. The present study discovered that circCTNNB1 and scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) expression levels were significantly down-regulated in mouse astrocytes (mAS) treated with oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD\/R), and similar results were observed in a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Overexpression of circCTNNB1 alleviated cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and the inflammatory response induced by OGD\/R in vitro. Up-regulation of circCTNNB1 increased SRB1 expression levels to protect mAS cells from OGD\/R-induced damage. CircCTNNB1 and SRB1 interacted with miR-96-5p, and the overexpression of miR-96-5p efficiently reversed the function of circCTNNB1 in OGD\/R-treated mAS cells. CircCTNNB1 protected against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by up-regulating SRB1 in vivo. In conclusion, our findings suggest that circCTNNB1 acts as a competitive endogenous RNA for miR-96-5p to alleviate cerebral IRI, which provides novel evidence that circCTNNB1 and SRB1 may be biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cerebral IRI.","121":"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal tumor associated with chronic inflammation.

Levels of CircSETD3 and microRNA (miR)-421 in CCA tissue and cell lines were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase-chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A direct target of miR-421 was predicted using TargetScan and further confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The activity of caspase-3 was also examined using caspase-3 activity detection kits. Moreover, the levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 modifying factor (BMF), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) in TFK1 cells were assessed using qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. We found that circSETD3 was downregulated, while miR-421 was upregulated in CCA tissues and cell lines. CircSETD3 negatively regulated miR-421 levels in TFK1 cells. Functional assays revealed that circSETD3-plasmid inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, promoted caspase-3 activity, enhanced Bax and cleaved-Caspase 3 expression, and reduced Bcl-2 levels, and these effects were reversed by miR-421 mimic. Meanwhile, similar results were observed in miR-421 inhibitor-transfected TFK1 cells, and these results were abolished by BMF-siRNA. BMF, a direct target of miR-421, was downregulated in CCA tissues and cell lines.

Besides, programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), an oncogene in numerous human cancers, has been identified as a therapeutic target for EC. Therefore, we intended to explore the potential regulatory network involving BLACAT1 and PD-L1 in EC. In this study, we observed increased BLACAT1 and PD-L1 levels in EC tissues and EC cell lines. Moreover, YY1 could activate BLACAT1 transcription in EC cells (TE-1 and EC9706). In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that BLACAT1 facilitated EC cell proliferation and metastasis and EC tumor growth. Also, the effects of BLACAT1 silencing on EC cell functions were partially reversed by PD-L1 overexpression. Besides, it was identified that BLACAT1 competed with PD-L1 to bind to miR-5590-3p in EC cells. Furthermore, miR-5590-3p suppression could abrogate the functional effects of BLACAT1 knockdown on EC cells; while PD-L1 silencing partly abolished the promoting effects of miR-5590-3p suppression on the biological functions of EC cells. To sum up, YY1-induced BLACAT1 accelerated EC progression via regulating the miR-5590-3p\/PD-L1 axis.","124":"Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is an inartificial saponin separated from astragalus membranaceus, which has exhibited key anti-tumor regulation in some cancers.

The interaction between miR-489-3p and circDLST or EIF4A1 was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Xenograft tumor assay was adopted to check the role of circDLST and AS-IV in vivo. CircDLST and EIF4A1 were upregulated but miR-489-3p was downregulated in GC cells. AS-IV restrained cell proliferation and metastasis in GC cells by downregulating circDLST. CircDLST served as a miR-489-3p sponge, and miR-489-3p inhibition reversed anti-tumor function of AS-IV. EIF4A1 was a target for miR-489-3p and circDLST sponged miR-489-3p to regulate EIF4A1. AS-IV suppressed GC cell progression via circDLST-mediated downregulation of EIF4A1. Also, AS-IV recued tumor growth in vivo via targeting circDLST to regulate miR-489-3p\/EIF4A1 axis.

The transcriptome data and relevant clinical data of LUAD were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The mRNA levels and prognosis of HSF2BP were determined using TCGA datasets. The protein and mRNA expression levels of HSF2BP were identified by conducting western blot analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in tissues and cells, respectively. To determine whether HSF2BP affected the biological function of LUAD cell lines, a series of functional experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis was applied to determine the pathways that HSF2BP regulated, which was further confirmed by western blotting, and the high expression of HSF2BP was observed in LUAD, which was correlated with the unfavorable prognosis in LUAD patients. Clinical correlation analysis revealed that tumor stage was positively correlated with high HSF2BP expression. Furthermore, HSF2BP could serve as an independent risk factor for overall survival. In vitro, HSF2BP knockdown suppressed the proliferation and migration of A549 and H1299 cells. We observed the same results in vivo experiments. Mechanistically, the HSF2BP regulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway to perform its biological function. The HSF2BP plays a role in the development of LUAD and could be a useful anticancer target for the treatment of LUAD.","127":"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammation caused by the deposition of dental plaque on the tooth surface. Human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) have the potential of osteogenic differentiation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are collectively involved in periodontitis. This study was designed to explore the roles of Linc01133 in osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs. hPDLSCs obtained from the periodontal ligament (PDL) of patients with periodontitis were used to collect Linc01133, microRNA-30c (miR-30c), and bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP) expression data, and their expression changes were traced during osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction as well as western blotting were used to analyze the levels of RNAs and proteins. Dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays demonstrated the relationship between Linc01133, miR-30c, and BGLAP. Furthermore, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarin red staining were applied to evaluate the degree of osteogenic differentiation. Linc01133 was downregulated in the PDL of patients with periodontitis. Upregulated Linc01133 promoted osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs. Linc01133 could inhibit miR-30c expression by sponging miR-30c. miR-30c suppressed osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, miR-30c targeted BGLAP. Knockdown of BGLAP abrogated the effects of decreased miR-30c on osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs. Linc01133 acted as a ceRNA to regulate osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs via the miR-30c\/BGLAP axis. Therefore, Linc01133 may participate in the progress of periodontitis.","128":"Cervical cancer (CC) is a gynecological cancer, which has become the second malignant tumor with mortality in developing countries. The purpose of current study was to explore the influence of Circular RNA 0001823 (circ_0001823) in the CC development. Thirty CC tissues and paracancerous tissues were obtained, and Hela and CaSki CC cells were purchased for this study. The cell growth was analyzed by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. The cell metastasis was determined with Transwell assay. The circ_0001823, miR-613, and RAB8A expression were analyzed with qRT-PCR analysis. The specific mechanisms of circRNA_0001823 were analyzed by Dual luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. The circ_0001823 and RAB8A expressions were increased, and miR-613 were decreased in the CC cells and tissues. Knockdown of circ_0001823 inhibited the malignant behavior of the CC cells, which was antagonized by miR-613 inhibitor. Over-expressed RAB8A reversed the miR-613 effects in the CC cells. Knockdown of circ_0001823 inhibited the malignant behaviors of the CC cells via regulating the miR-613\/RAB8A axis.","129":null,"130":"Long non-coding RNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (lncRNA HOTAIR) is thought to be a key regulator of the occurrence and development of osteosarcoma (OS). The expression of HOTAIR, microRNA miR-6888-3p, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase\/AKT (PI3K\/AKT) pathway-related proteins in OS was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Changes in the proliferation and migration of OS cells were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assays after the knockdown of HOTAIR, miR-6888-3p, or SYK. Luciferase assays, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down assays were used to detect the relationship between miR-6888-3p and HOTAIR or SYK. We found that HOTAIR and SYK were highly expressed in OS, whereas miR-6888-3p expression was low. In addition, downregulation of HOTAIR or SYK significantly inhibited the growth and migration of OS cells and the PI3K\/AKT pathway, both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, downregulation of miR-6888-3p promoted the proliferation and migration of OS cells and activated the PI3K\/AKT pathway. Mechanistically, these results suggest that the HOTAIR sponge, miR-6888-3p, regulates SYK expression. To summarize, HOTAIR regulates SYK by acting on miR-6888-3p, thereby promoting the proliferation and migration of OS cells.","131":"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Although ASXL transcriptional regulator 3 (ASXL3) has been reported to cause hereditary CHD, ASXL3-mediated mechanisms in heart development remain unclear. In this study, we used dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to induce differentiation in P19 cells, observed cell morphology using light microscopy after ASXL3 knockdown, and determined the levels of associated myocardial cell markers using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Subsequently, we used microRNA sequencing, messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing, and bioinformatics to initially identify the possible mechanisms through which ASXL3-related microRNAs and mRNAs affect heart development. The results indicated that DMSO induced P19 cell differentiation, which could be inhibited by ASXL3 knockdown. We screened 1214 and 1652 differentially expressed microRNAs and mRNAs, respectively, through ASXL3 knockdown and sequencing; these differentially expressed miRNAs were largely enriched in PI3K-Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Rap1 signaling pathways. Additionally, 11 miRNAs associated with heart development were selected through a literature review. Our analysis indicated the involvement of mmu-miR-323-3p in P19 cell differentiation through the PI3K-Akt pathway. In conclusion, ASXL3 may be involved in the regulation of heart development. This comprehensive study of differentially expressed microRNAs and mRNAs through ASXL3 knockdown in P19 cells provides new insights that may aid the prevention and treatment of CHD.","132":"The long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) has been reported to function as a suppressor in many cancers. However, the role and mechanism of lncRNA GAS5 in pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) remain unclear. Here, we found that lncRNA GAS5 and cylindromatosis (CYLD) expression was downregulated in invasive PitNET tissues and was negatively correlated with miR-27a-5p expression. LncRNA GAS5 overexpression inhibited proliferation of PitNETs cell line MMQ and GH3 cells and induced cell apoptosis, simultaneously, inhibited miR-27a-5p expression and increased CYLD expression. Moreover, miR-27a-5p mimic significantly decreased the luciferase activities of lncRNA GAS5 and CYLD luciferase reporter vector and downregulated CYLD expression, while miR-27a-5p inhibitor increased the expression of CYLD in MMQ and GH3 cells. Furthermore, RNA-immunoprecipitation assay revealed the direct binding between lncRNA GAS5 and miR-27a-5p. Additionally, miR-27a-5p mimic or silenced CYLD attenuated the effect of lncRNA GAS5 on MMQ and GH3 cell proliferation. In vivo lncRNA GAS5 overexpression inhibited GH3 cell tumor growth, while miR-27a-5p mimic or silenced CYLD attenuated the effect of lncRNA GAS5 on GH3 cell tumor growth. These results suggest that lncRNA GAS5 acts as an endogenous sponge by binding miR-27a-5p to increase the expression of its target gene CYLD, thereby inhibits PitNETs cell proliferation and tumor growth.","133":"This study aims to investigate the protective effect of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in sepsis by regulating macrophage polarization and its mechanism. The mouse macrophages were cultured and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and some cells were intervened with GDF15 and LY294002. The proinflammatory activated (M1) macrophages and the anti-inflammatory activated (M2) macrophages were measured and observed, and the messenger RNA expression levels of their biomarkers, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt) were detected. The survival rate, cardiac function, and histopathological sections were observed. In the LPS group, after GDF15 intervention, the percentage of M1 macrophages decreased and M2 macrophages increased, the infiltration of monocytes\/macrophages into the heart was inhibited, systemic and cardiac inflammation was reduced, and the survival time of the mice was prolonged. GDF15 regulated macrophage polarization and played an anti-inflammatory role by activating the phosphorylation of the PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway. In patients with sepsis, the serum GDF15 level increased and was closely related to the severity of the sepsis and the 28-day mortality rate and could be used as a prognostic marker of sepsis. GDF15 regulates macrophage polarization through activating the PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway and has a protective effect on survival and the cardiac function of patients with sepsis and sepsis mouse models. The increase in serum GDF15 level is closely related to severity and mortality in patients with sepsis and is therefore a prognostic marker of sepsis.","134":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can enhance the risk of mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and aggravate pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). This study intended to explore the function of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in T2DM-PTB and the molecules involved. Mice were treated with streptozotocin to induce T2DM and then infected with Mtb. The mice with T2DM had increased weight, blood glucose level, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and increased susceptibility to PTB after Mtb infection. PTEN was significantly downregulated in mice with T2DM-PTB and it had specific predictive value in patients. Overexpression of PTEN improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial load, inflammatory infiltration, cell apoptosis, and fibrosis in lung tissues. Sp1 transcription factor (SP1) was predicted and identified as an upstream regulator of PTEN. SP1 suppressed PTEN transcription. Silencing of SP1 enhanced mouse survival and alleviated the lung injury, and it promoted the M1 polarization of macrophages in murine lung tissues. However, further downregulation of PTEN increased protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation and blocked the alleviating roles of SP1 silencing in T2DM-PTB. This study demonstrates that SP1 represses PTEN transcription to promote lung injury in mice with T2DM-PTB through Akt activation.","135":"Based on the research methods of network pharmacology, this study analyzed the improvement effect of berberine (BBR) on premature ovarian failure (POF) and its molecular mechanism. Carry out GO and KEGG enrichment analysis by R language to obtain the potential targets and pathways of BBR in the improvement of POF. Use SD rats and ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) for experimental verification. ELISA was used to measure the content of related hormones in the serum, CCK-8 was used to measure cell viability, western blot was used to measure the content of the target protein in the ovaries and GCs, and q-RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of the target genes in the ovaries and GCs. Predicted by network pharmacology: PTEN, AKT1, FoxO1, FasL, and Bim are the targets with the highest relative correlation between BBR and POF. The results of experiments show that the treatment of low and medium doses of BBR can increase the ovarian index of rats; BBR can increase the levels of Estradiol (E2) and Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the serum of rats and reduce the levels of Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing hormone (LH). BBR can increase the cell viability of GCs; BBR can inhibit the PTEN\/AKT1\/FoxO1 signaling pathway and its phosphorylation level and reduce the expression of Fas\/FasL and Bim mRNA. Overall, BBR can promote the ovarian to maintain normal hormone levels, protect GCs, and enhance the function of POF.","136":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely studied and play crucial roles in cervical cancer (CC) progression. Here, we investigated the function and mechanism of lncRNA PGM5-AS1 action in CC cells. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blotting, PGM5-AS1 and decorin (DCN) were downregulated in CC tissues and cells, whereas miR-4284 was upregulated. Luciferase assay, RNA pull-down assay, and western blotting showed that PGM5-AS1 could sponge miR-4284 to upregulate DCN expression in CC cells. Additionally, cell functional experiments showed that PGM5-AS1 overexpression led to decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of CC cells. However, the inhibitory effect of PGM5-AS1 overexpression on CC cells was partly relieved by DCN knockdown because of the targeting interaction between PGM5-AS1, miR-4284, and DCN. In summary, this study identified that PGM5-AS1 negatively regulates CC cell malignancy by targeting miR-4284\/DCN.","137":null,"138":"Radiotherapy has been established as a major therapeutic modality for glioma, whereas new therapeutic targets are needed to prevent tumor recurrence. This study intends to explore the regulatory role of magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1) in radiotherapy resistance of glioma through modulating ERK and programmed death-1-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Our bioinformatics analysis identified differentially expressed MAGT1 in glioma, expression of which was subsequently determined in cohort data of TCGA database and microarray dataset as well as glioma cell lines. Artificial modulation of MAGT1, ERK, and PD-L1 expression was performed to examine their effects on glioma cell proliferation and radioresistance, as reflected by MTT and colony formation assays under irradiation. Mouse glioma cells with manipulated MAGT1 and ERK inhibitors were further injected into mice to assess the in vivo tumor formation ability of glioma cells. It was noted that MAGT1 expression was highly expressed in glioma tissues of TCGA data and microarray dataset, which was then validated in glioma cell lines. Ectopic expression of MAGT1 was revealed to promote the proliferation and radioresistance of glioma cells, which was attributed to the MAGT1-mediated activation of the ERK\/MAPK signaling pathway. It was illuminated that MAGT1 stimulated PD-L1 expression through the ERK\/MAPK pathway and thus facilitated glioma cell growth. Additionally, MAGT1 overexpression accelerated the in vivo tumor formation of glioma cells, while the ERK inhibitor negated its effect. In conclusion, MAGT1 enhances the growth and radioresistance of glioma cells through the ERK\/MAPK signaling pathway-mediated upregulation of PD-L1 expression.","139":null,"140":"The recurrence and metastasis of gastric cancer are related to the stemness of gastric cancer cells. Researches have shown that miR-18 level is negatively correlated to the occurrence and development of certain cancer types. However, the effects of miR-18 on the stemness of gastric cancer remain uncertain. In this research, gastric cancer cell lines with stable overexpression of miR-18 were constructed through lentivirus infection. CCK-8 assay, RT-qPCR, Western blot, flow cytometry, and in vivo tumorigenesis assays were performed to evaluate the effects of miR-18 on the stemness of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays found that Meis2 was the target of miR-18. Furthermore, we also found that the low-expressed oncogene HMGB3 is involved in this miR-18\/Meis2 axis to further promote the stemness of gastric cancer cells. These findings suggest that the miR-18\/Meis2\/HMGB3 axis may be potential prognostic indicators for patients with gastric cancer.","141":null,"142":"Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic gynecological syndrome. Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs participate in the pathogenesis and development of endometriosis. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of DHRS4 antisense RNA 1 (DHRS4-AS1) in endometriosis. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to determine the relationship between DHRS4-AS1, microRNA (miR)-139-5p, and arrestin domain-containing 3 (ARRDC3). Furthermore, the expression of DHRS4-AS1 and miR-139-5p in ectopic endometrial stromal cells (EC-ESCs) and endometriosis tissues was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), flow cytometry, and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration and invasion of EC-ESCs, respectively. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were further utilized to determine cleaved-Caspase 3, Caspase 3, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) expression levels. Compared with the EN group, DHRS4-AS1 levels were lower and miR-139-5p levels were higher in EC-ESCs and tissues obtained from patients with endometriosis. Functional assays validated that DHRS4-AS1 targets miR-139-5p, with ARRDC3 being a downstream target of miR-139-5p. Rescue experiments demonstrated that DHRS4-AS1 inhibited EC-ESC proliferation, migration, and invasion, but promoted apoptosis, by targeting miR-139-5p in endometriosis. cleaved-Caspase3 expression level and the cleaved-Caspase 3\/Caspase 3 ratio increased, while the expression levels of MMP-9 decreased, after transfection with DHRS4-AS1 overexpression plasmids; however, the effects induced by DHRS4-AS1 overexpression could be partially reversed by co-transfection with the miR-139-5p mimic. The current study demonstrates that the DHRS4-AS1\/miR-139-5p\/ARRDC3 axis participates in the regulation of EC-ESC function.","143":"Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) has been involved in the progression of gastric cancer (GC). Our analysis of GC-related gene expression profiles identified the significantly up-regulated miR-642b-3p expression, which has been reported as a mediator in various cancers but rarely mentioned in researches on GC. Herein, this study intends to investigate the role of miR-642b-3p in GC development. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to predict the downstream target gene of miR-642b-3p. Expression patterns of miR-642b-3p and CUB and sushi multiple domains protein 1 (CSMD1) in GC tissues and cell lines was then determined. Immunofluorescence, wound healing and Transwell invasion assays were performed to observe the malignant behaviors of GC cells with altered expression of miR-642b-3p and CSMD1. Nude mice with xenograft tumors were developed for in vivo validation. miR-642b-3p expression was increased in GC tissues and cell lines. miR-642b-3p targeted CSMD1 and reduced the expression of CSMD1, thereby inhibiting the activation of Smad signaling pathway. By this mechanism, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasive and migratory potentials of GC cells were repressed. Meanwhile, in vivo data verified that miR-642b-3p enhanced the tumor growth of GC cells, which was associated with blockade of CSMD1-dependent activation of the Smad signaling pathway. Overall, miR-642b-3p acts as an oncomiR promoting tumor development in GC through suppressing CSMD1 expression and inactivating the Smad signaling pathway, which may enable the development of new therapeutic strategies for treatment of GC.","144":null,"145":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a malignant tumor that threatens women's health. Exploring novel development-associated biomarkers could help improve the survival rate of TNBC. This study evaluated the significance and mechanism of LINC01315 in TNBC progression aiming to identify a potential biomarker. There were 103 TNBC patients that provided clinical tissues in this study. The expression of LINC01315 was assessed by PCR and its association with clinical data was evaluated by statistical analyses. The in vitro cell experiments were conducted to estimate the biological effect of LINC01315 and its molecular mechanism. A significant upregulation of LINC01315 was observed in TNBC, which was associated with disease development and severity of patients. The upregulation of LINC01315 could be a symptom of the poor prognosis of patients. The knockdown of LINC01315 suppressed the main cellular processes of TNBC progression. Additionally, miR-876-5p was demonstrated to be a target of LINC01315 and regulate the expression of GRK5, through which LINC01315 modulated the progression of TNBC. Upregulated LINC01315 in TNBC indicated the malignant development and poor survival rate of patients. Inhibition of LINC01315 might be a potential therapeutic strategy of TNBC.","146":"Artificial skins have been used as skin substitutes for wound healing in the clinic, and as in vitro models for safety assessment in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. The three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technique provides a promising strategy in the fabrication of artificial skins. Despite the technological advances, many challenges remain to be conquered, such as the complicated preparation conditions for bio-printed skin and the unavailability of stability and robustness of skin bioprinting. Here, we formulated a novel bio-ink composed of gelatin, sodium alginate and fibrinogen. By optimizing the ratio of components in the bio-ink, the design of the 3D model and the printing conditions, a fibroblasts-containing dermal layer construct was firstly fabricated, on the top of which laminin and keratinocytes were sequentially placed. Through air-liquid interface (ALI) culture by virtue of sterile wire mesh, a full-thickness skin tissue was thus prepared. HE and immunofluorescence staining showed that the bio-printed skin was not only morphologically representative of the human skin, but also expressed the specific markers related to epidermal differentiation and stratum corneum formation. The presented easy and robust preparation of full-thickness skin constructs provides a powerful tool for the establishment of artificial skins, holding critical academic significance and application value.","147":"Cisplatin (DDP) resistance is a principal cause leading to poor prognosis in females suffering from ovarian cancer (OC). Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been shown to have an involvement in regulating cellular processes; chemoresistance being one of them the precise object of this work was to probe into the role of lncRNA ACTA2-AS1 in OC cells that have developed DDP resistance. We developed DDP-resistant OC cell lines (A2780\/DDP and SKOV3\/DDP). The influence of the ACTA2-AS1\/miR-378a-3p\/Wnt5a axis on DDP chemoresistance of DDP-resistant OC cells was ascertained using real-time PCR, Elisa, and CCK-8, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. In DDP-resistant cells and tissues, ACTA2-AS1 was increased, while a substantial downregulation in miR-378a-3p was noticed. In cells manifesting DDP-resistance, knocking down ACTA2-AS1 boosted the expression of miR-378a-3p. Further research into the mechanism of ACTA2-AS1 revealed that it acted as a 'sponge' by getting involved in a competition against miR-378a-3p binding to modify its target Wnt5a. The suppression of DDP-resistance in OC cells caused by ACTA2-AS1 downregulation was reversed by silencing miR-378a-3p. Furthermore, via inhibition of Wnt5a, miR-378a-3p alleviated DDP resistance in OC cells. These findings show that for miR-378a-3p, ACTA2-AS1 works like a sponge thus preventing it from binding to Wnt5a and boosting OC cell DDP resistance. Our research will aid the expansion of plausible therapeutic options for treating OC.","148":"Epidural fibrosis (EF) is a serious complication when the patients suffer from operations of lumbar laminectomy. It is reported that quercetin plays a positive role in the prevention of various fibrotic diseases. However, the role of quercetin in the prevention of epidural fibrosis (EF) and its possible mechanism are unclear. Fibroblast proliferation is considered to be the main cause of epidural fibrosis.Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is essential for survival, differentiation, development, and homeostasis.Although autophagy has been associated with fibrosis of different tissues, the effect of autophagy on epidural fibrosis is still unknown.The aim of this study was to investigate the function and mechanism of autophagy induced by quercetin, a polyphenol derived from plants. In vivo, the effect of quercetin on reducing epidural fibrosis was confirmed via histological staining and immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that quercetin had significant suppressive effects on epidural fibrosis following laminectomy in rats.In vitro,, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and Edu staining, TUNEL staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect the effects of quercetin on the proliferation and apoptosis of fibroblasts and explore the possible signal transduction pathway. Results indicated that quercetin could induce autophagy and inhibit proliferation in fibroblasts. In conclusion, Quercetin could regulate fibroblast proliferation, apoptosis, migration and other biological behaviors through autophagy, thereby preventing epidural fibrosis. The specific corresponding pathway may be the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling pathway.","149":"PCGEM1 facilitates prostate cancer (PCa) progression. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of action of PCGEM1 in PCa. The expression of PCGEM1, microRNA miR-129-5p, chromatin licensing, and DNA replication factor 1 (CDT1) was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). A series of function experiments including cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), caspase-3 activity, and cell cycle assays were performed to evaluate the influence of PCGEM1, miR-129-5p, and CDT1 on the biological processes of PCa cells. CyclinD1, cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), Bax, and Bcl-2 protein levels were measured by western blotting. Subcellular isolation revealed the distribution of PCa cells. The connections between PCGEM1, miR-129-5p, and CDT1 were evaluated by luciferase, RIP assay, and Pearson correlation analysis. Both PCGEM1 and CDT1 were upregulated in PCa, while miR-129-5p was downregulated and negatively correlated with PCGEM1 and CDT1. Downregulation of PCGEM1 or CDT1 inhibited the viability, promoted apoptosis and cycle arrest of PCa cells in vitro, and controlled tumor growth in vivo. PCGEM1 plays a crucial role in the progression of PCa by sponging miR-129-5p as a ceRNA of CDT1. PCGEM1 is a CDT1-dependent PCa promoter site that absorbs miR-129-5p.","150":"Fractures are frequently encountered diseases troubling the senior population, and the research on fracture repair and the exploration of effective treatment methods are of great significance. This study aimed to clarify the effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (hUMSC-EVs) on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of autologous bone marrow stem cells (ABMSCs). The two kinds of cells were co-cultured firstly, 5-Ethynyl-2'- deoxyuridine (EDU) staining and alizarin red staining were used to detect the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of ABMSCs. The exosomes of hUMSCs were subsequently extracted to process ABMSCs to further test the effect on the cells. The EDU positive rate of ABMSCs and Collagen II expression were elevated, whereas the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive rate and Matrix Metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) were markedly decreased after the co-culture of hUMSCs and ABMSCs using Transwell chamber assays. The results indicated that hUMSCs could increase the proliferation of ABMSCs, reduce apoptosis, and promote matrix metabolism. The hUMSCs exosomes were separated and added to ABMSCs. As the exosomes content increased, the proliferation of ABMSCs increased simultaneously, and ABMSCs apoptosis decreased. Meanwhile, ABMSCs that migrated to the submembrane increased compared with untreated ABMSCs. Western blot, qPCR and immunofluorescence results revealed that increased exosomes contents promoted the expression of ABMSCs anabolic-related indicators gradually, while decreased the expression of catabolism-related indicators gradually. The previously described results indicated that hUMSCs promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of ABMSCs by secreting exosomes.","151":"Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is the most common type, comprising 75-85% of all liver malignancies. We investigated the roles of cleavage stimulation factor 2 (CSTF2) in LIHC and explored the underlying mechanisms. CSTF2 expression and its association with LIHC patient survival probability were analyzed with The Cancer Genome Atlas. CSTF2 expression in LIHC cells was assessed using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. Alterations in CSTF2 expression were induced by cell transfection. Cell colony formation, apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, and migration were assessed using colony formation, flow cytometry, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, and transwell assays. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The expression of apoptosis-, metastasis-, and pathway-associated factors was determined via western blot. The pathway rescue assay was further performed using 740Y-P or Wortmannin. CSTF2 upregulation was observed in LIHC tissues and cells. Patients with high CSTF2 expression had a lower probability of overall survival. CSTF2 overexpression enhanced colony formation, proliferation, invasion and migration, while repressing apoptosis in LIHC cells. GSEA revealed that CSTF2 was mainly enriched in the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase\/protein kinase B\/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR) pathway. Western blot analysis proved that CSTF2 overexpression activated this pathway. CSTF2 knockdown yielded the opposite effects. 740Y-P, a PI3K activator, reversed the CSTF2 knockdown-triggered effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration. Moreover, Wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, also reversed the CSTF2 overexpression-induced effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration. These results indicated that CSTF2 overexpression might exacerbate the malignant phenotypes of LIHC cells via activation of PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway.","152":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are crucial non-coding RNAs in the process of tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the biological function of circ_0004277 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is blurred. Microarray data of circRNAs were utilized to evaluate circRNAs' differential expression in AML. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was executed to determine circ_0004277 and microRNA-134-5p (miR-134-5p) expression levels. The growth, migration and invasion of AML cells were tested by the cell counting kit-8 and Transwell experiment. Dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiment and RNA pull-down experiment were executed to determine the targeting relationship between circ_0004277 and miR-134-5p. Western blot assay was used to detect single stranded DNA binding protein 2 (SSBP2) expression. We observed that circ_0004277 was down-regulated in AML, while miR-134-5p was up-regulated. Functionally, circ_0004277 overexpression or inhibition of miR-134-5p remarkably suppressed AML cell viability, migration and invasion. Furthermore, miR-134-5p served as a direct downstream target of circ_0004277 and SSBP2 was identified as a target of miR-134-5p. Compensation experiments showed that miR-134-5p mimics abolished the biological function of circ_0004277 on malignant phenotypes of AML cells.

It is becoming a hot topic to identify new indicators for the early prediction of therapeutic effects and adverse reactions during the long-term use of BPs. To determine whether microRNA (miRNA) expression is modulated by long-term BPs treatment, we performed miRNA expression profiling analysis in patients receiving long-term BP treatment for postmenopausal OP. To assess the effect of BPs on miRNA expression, we used an Affymetrix Genechip miRNA array to analyze serum samples obtained from postmenopausal OP patients on long-term BP treatment and healthy controls. MiRNAs affected by BPs and their predicted targets were examined. We also investigated the effects of miRNA on osteoblast differentiation in vitro and on ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo. We observed that the level of miR-30a-5p was significantly increased in patients receiving long-term BP treatment for postmenopausal OP. Furthermore, miR-30a-5p was negatively correlated with bone formation. Consistent with this, in vitro osteoblast activity and matrix mineralization were increased by an antagomir of miR-30a-5p and decreased by an agomir of miR-30a-5p. We also found that miR-30a-5p directly targeted RUNX1 to inhibit osteoblastic differentiation. Consistent with the in vitro results, miR-30a-5p antagomir administration promoted bone formation in ovariectomized mice. Our findings identified miR-30a-5p as a novel mediator of long-term BP treatment that regulates bone formation in postmenopausal OP patients.","157":"Matrine exhibits anti-tumor effect on the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells by reducing the activity of the p38 signaling pathway. However, these studies were limited because the underlying mechanism by which matrine inhibited CRC progression remained unclear. In this study, we provided for the first time that endoplasmic reticulum lipid raft associated protein 1 (Erlin1) is a novel target of matrine. Erlin1 was significantly upregulated in tumors and its knockdown suppressed the proliferation and migration of CRC cells, while its overexpression promoted CRC cell growth and migration. Furthermore, Erlin1 overexpression promoted inhibited apoptosis. Importantly, matrine treatment could reverse the oncogenic function of Erlin1 on CRC cell proliferation and migration. When Erlin1 was knocked down, matrine exhibited a more obvious anti-tumor effect in CRC cells. Partly due to this, matrine functions as an important anti-tumor drug and the results discovered here may clarify the mechanisms of matrine application for CRC treatment. CRC patients with low expression of Erlin1 might be more suitable for the treatment of matrine. This study could promote the application of matrine to be a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC patients.","158":"Endothelial dysfunction is an important mechanism involved in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I\/R) injury. We aimed to explore the effects of Oxycodone on myocardial I\/R injury in vivo and in vitro to reveal its mechanisms related to Sigma-1 Receptor (SIGMAR1). A rat model of I\/R-induced myocardial injury was developed. The ischemic area and myocardial histopathological changes after oxycodone addition were evaluated by TTC staining and H&amp;E staining. LDH, CK-MB and cTnI levels were used to assess myocardial function. Then, the endothelial integrity was reflected by the expressions of ZO-1, Claudin-1 and Occludin. Afterward, ELISA, RT-qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assays were adopted for the detection of inflammation-related genes. SIGMAR1 expression in myocardial tissues induced by I\/R and cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) under hypoxic\/reoxygenation (H\/R) was determined using RT-qPCR and western blotting. Subsequently, after SIGMAR1 silencing or BD1047 addition (a SIGMAR1 antagonist), cell apoptosis and endothelial integrity were analyzed in the presence of Oxycodone in H\/R-stimulated CMECs. Results indicated that Oxycodone decreased the ischemic area and improved myocardial function in myocardial I\/R injury rat. Oxycodone improved myocardial histopathological injury and elevated endothelial integrity, evidenced by upregulated ZO-1, Claudin-1 and Occludin expressions. Moreover, inflammatory response was alleviated after Oxycodone administration. Molecular docking suggested that SIGMAR1 could directly bind to Oxycodone. Oxycodone elevated SIGMAR1 expression and SIGMAR1 deletion or BD1047 addition attenuated the impacts of Oxycodone on apoptosis and endothelial integrity of CMECs induced by H\/R. Collectively, Oxycodone alleviates myocardial I\/R injury in vivo and in vitro by binding to SIGMAR1.","159":"In the recent study, we have developed novel tumor targetable and pH-sensitive PLGA nanoparticles co-loaded with camptothecin (CPT) and metformin (Metf) to simultaneously improve the Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and malignant breast cancer. To improve the drug loading efficiency, the hydrophobic CPT was conjugated with PLGA polymer by the pH-sensitive hydrazone bonds (hyd). Then, the Metf was physically loaded into the hydrophobicity inner core of CPT-conjugated PLGA nanocomplex to form the dual drugs-loaded nanoparticles (NP\/CPT-Metf). Furthermore, on the surface of NP\/CPT-Metf was modified with tumor-homing CGKRK peptides to obtain the tumor targetable and pH-sensitive polymer nanoparticles (CNP\/CPT-Metf). It was demonstrated that the developed CNP\/CPT-Metf displayed sufficient sensitivity to the weak acidic tumor microenvironment. Besides, excellent ability of CNP\/CPT-Metf to mediate accumulation of drugs in cells and tumor tissues finally in turn resulted in a signal enhanced anti-tumor effect. Furthermore, it was demonstrated as well that CNP\/CPT-Metf was able of significantly alleviating the type 2 diabetes mellitus in diabetic mice. In summary, the developed multifunctional polymer nanoparticles might represent a promising strategy for simultaneously improve the T2DM and treat malignant breast cancer.","160":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) OPA-interacting protein 5 antisense transcript 1 (OIP5-AS1) plays an oncogenic role in several types of cancer, but whether it is involved in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear. Our preliminary sequencing analysis revealed the upregulation of OIP5-AS1 in NSCLC. In this study, gene expression levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR. RNA-RNA pull-down assay was applied to detect direct interactions between RNAs. Overexpression assays were performed to explore the relationship between miR-34a and OIP5-AS1. CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay were applied to evaluate cell proliferation. In NSCLC cells (H23), overexpression of OIP5-AS1 increased the expression levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). In addition, inhibition of OIP5-AS1 and overexpression of miR-34a decreased the expression levels of PD-L1, and miR-34a significantly blocked the role of overexpression of OIP5-AS1. Overexpression of OIP5-AS1 and PD-L1 promoted H23 and H22 cells proliferation, while silencing of miR-34a and OIP5-AS1 played opposite roles and eliminated the effects of overexpression of OIP5-AS1 on cell proliferation. Therefore, OIP5-AS1 was upregulated to enhance the expression of oncogenic PD-L1 by sponging miR-34a in NSCLC, leading to promoted NSCLC cell proliferation. Our study also demonstrated that OIP5-AS1 was upregulated while miR-34a was downregulated in NSCLC.","161":"The LaSota strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a commonly used vaccine to control Newcastle disease. However, improper immunization is a common reason for vaccine failure. Hence, it is imperative to thoroughly explore innate immunity-related molecular regulatory responses to the LaSota vaccine. In this text, 140 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 8 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 1514 mRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed by RNA sequencing analysis in the thymic tissues of Chinese Partridge Shank chickens after LaSota vaccine inoculation. Moreover, 70 dysregulated genes related to innate immunity were identified based on GO, Reactome pathway, and InnateDB annotations and differential expression analysis. Additionally, dysregulated lncRNAs and innate immunity-related mRNAs that could interact with dysregulated miRNAs were identified based on bioinformatics prediction analysis via the miRanda software and differential expression analysis. Among these transcripts, expression patterns of five lncRNAs, seven miRNAs, and six mRNAs were further examined by RT-qPCR assay. Both RNA-seq and RT-qPCR outcomes showed that 10 transcripts (MSTRG.22689.1, ENSGALT00000065826, ENSGALT00000059336, ENSGALT00000060887, gga-miR-6575-5p, gga-miR-6631-5p, gga-miR-1727, paraoxonase 2 (PON2), mitogen-activated protein kinase 10, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) were highly expressed, and 4 transcripts (MSTRG.188121.10, gga-miR-6655-5p, gga-miR-6548-3p, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) were low expressed after NDV infection. Additionally, two potential competing endogenous RNA networks (ENSGALT00000060887\/gga-miR-6575-5p\/PON2 or MSTRG.188121.10\/gga-miR-6631-5p\/MMP9) and some co-expression axes (ENSGALT00000065826\/gga-miR-6631-5p, MSTRG.188121.10\/gga-miR-6575-5p, MSTRG.188121.10\/CFTR, ENSGALT00000060887\/MMP9) were identified based on RT-qPCR and co-expression analyses.

CircRNAs have been reported to play regulatory roles in many cancers, including CRC. This study focuses on the role of circ_0007331 in CRC. Differentially expressed circRNAs in CRC were screened using the GEO database. RT-qPCR was used to analyze mRNA expression. StarBase and TargetScan were used to predict targeting relationships and then verified by the dual luciferase reporter assay along with the RNA pull-down assay. CCK-8 as well and transwell assays were used to measure cell viability, migration, and invasion. Protein levels were determined using western blotting. circ_0007331 is expressed more frequently in patients with CRC. The inhibition of circ_0007331 expression reduced the viability, colony formation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. However, inhibition of miR-205-5p or elevation of high-mobility group A2 (HMGA2) can reverse the function of inhibited circ_0007331 in tumor cells. This study demonstrated that the circ_0007331\/miR-205-5p\/HMGA2 axis promotes CRC development. Thus, circ_0007331 may be a potential biomarker for CRC.","164":"Accumulating evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) function as conclusive modulators in diverse tumors, including in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nonetheless, knowledge of the latent mechanisms involving circRNAs in HCC development is insufficient. circSEC24A (hsa_circ_0003528) was discovered by microarray analysis of patients with HCC. Binding sites between circSEC24A, miR-421, miR-421 and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) were predicted using online bioinformatics tools. Interactions involving miRNA and target genes or circRNAs were verified by luciferase reporter-gene and RNA pull-down assays. Two HCC cell lines (HCCLM3 and Hep3B) and normal THLE-2 liver cells were used for in vitro experiments. miRNA and mRNA expression levels were detected by RT-qPCR, and protein expression was measured by western blotting. Cell proliferation was evaluated using Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) assays along with colony formation assays. Cell invasion and migration were determined using the Transwell and wound healing migration assays. A xenograft model was used to evaluate the role of circSEC24A in vivo. circSEC24A expression was significantly upregulated in HCCLM3 and Hep3B cells. Silencing circSEC24A mitigated the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells, which was abrogated by downregulation of miR-421. Meanwhile, MMP3 could bind to miR-421 to decrease the functional effects of miR-421 and induce tumor metastasis. Knockdown of cicSEC24A suppressed tumor growth in vivo. circSEC24A interference suppressed HCC cell EMT by sponging miR-421, further regulating MMP3, and inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, circSEC24A could represent a potential target for HCC patient treatment.","165":"Altered long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) exert pivotal parts in pathogenic processes in glioma. Here, we uncovered a differentially expressed long intergenic non-coding RNA 1088 (LINC01088) in glioma and elucidated the molecular mechanism by which LINC01088 affected the malignant phenotypes of glioma cells. Functionally, LINC01088 silencing degraded cell proliferation, invasion in glioma, while LINC01088 overexpression elicited opposite results. Mechanistically, we verified LINC01088 physically interacted with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A (SNRPA) and regulated the expression of SNRPA at the transcription level. Phenotypic analysis ascertained that LINC01088 substantively aggravated glioma cell progression in an SNRPA-dependent manner, and SNRPA played a pivotal part in the tumor-promoting properties of LINC01088. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism by which LINC01088 exerted pro-oncogenic functions through binding with SNRPA and transcriptionally regulating SNRPA mRNA in glioma.","166":"Increasing epidemiological evidence supports the strong association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and cognitive dysfunction. Omarigliptin is a long-acting dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes. However, the effect of Omarigliptin in diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction has not been reported. In this study, we established an in vivo diabetic mice model through streptozotocin (STZ) treatment and investigated the therapeutic effect of Omarigliptin in diabetic mice. The results show that administration with Omarigliptin reduced the food and water intake of STZ-induced diabetic mice, accompanied by decreased blood glucose levels and increased serum insulin levels. The Y-Maze test demonstrated that Omarigliptin ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Omarigliptin presented a protective role in the brain, as shown by the decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, increased NAD+\/NADH ratio, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, and ATP synthase activity in the hippocampus. Omarigliptin induced the increased expression level of mitochondrial inner membrane protein sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and regulated its substrates, including forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Furthermore, knockdown of SIRT3 abolished the protective effects of Omarigliptin on mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive dysfunction in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that Omarigliptin improved insulin sensitivity and cognitive function in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Mechanistically, SIRT3 expression is required for the effect of Omarigliptin. This study provided preclinical evidence that Omarigliptin has the neuroprotective effect to improve diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction.","167":"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a deadly malignant tumor that threatens human health. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is widely expressed in eukaryotes and is closely associated with human disease progression. However, its role in ESCC remains incompletely understood. In this study, we analyzed the results of three gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases containing lncRNA expression data of ESCC and normal tissues. The results showed that HCP5 was significantly overexpressed in ESCC tissues, which was further verified in our collected ESCC samples. The functional study suggested that HCP5 knockdown inhibited ESCC cell proliferation and invasion. Regarding the mechanism, HCP5 was able to directly interact with YTHDF1, a N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader, enhancing the binding of YTHDF1 to m6A-modified HK2 mRNA, leading to increasing HK2 stability, thereby promoting the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) of ESCC cells. The nude mice model showed that the knockdown of HCP5 in vivo remarkably reduced tumor size. Clinically, high HCP5 was positively correlated with larger tumor volume, higher TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, ESCC patients with high HCP5 exerted shorter survival time than patients with low HCP5. These findings uncover the importance of HCP5 in human ESCC progression; the turbulence of HCP5\/YTHDF1\/HK2 axis may be responsible for ESCC carcinogenicity.","168":"Sustainable development serves as the foundation for a range of international and national policymaking. Traditional breeding methods have been used to modify plant genomes and production. Genetic engineering is the practice of assisting agricultural systems in adapting to rapidly changing global growth by hastening the breeding of new varieties. On the other hand, the development of genetic engineering has enabled more precise control over the genomic alterations made in recent decades. Genetic changes from one species can now be introduced into a completely unrelated species, increasing agricultural output or making certain elements easier to manufacture. Harvest plants and soil microorganisms are just a few of the more well-known genetically modified creatures. Researchers assess current studies and illustrate the possibility of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) from the perspectives of various stakeholders. GMOs increase yields, reduce costs, and reduce agriculture's terrestrial and ecological footprint. Modern technology benefits innovators, farmers, and consumers alike. Agricultural biotechnology has numerous applications, each with its own set of potential consequences. This will be able to reach its full potential if more people have access to technology and excessive regulation is avoided. This paper covers the regulations for genetically modified crops (GMCs) as well as the economic implications.

Kinetochore-associated protein 1 (KNTC1) that regulates the cell cycle by regulating mitosis is related to the malignant behavior of different types of tumors. However, its role in the development of cervical cancer remains unclear. In this study, we initially explored the role of KNTC1 in cervical cancer. KNTC1 expression and relevant information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and dataset GSE63514 in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for bioinformatics analyses. Cell proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) and colony formation assays. Wound healing and Transwell assays were used to evaluate cell migration and invasion abilities. Protein expression levels of matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) were measured by western blotting. Nude mouse models of subcutaneous xenograft tumor were constructed to analyze tumor growth in vivo. CCK8 and colony formation assay results demonstrated that the proliferation rate of SiHa and C-33A cells decreased when KNTC1 was silenced. Western blot and Transwell assays indicated that KNTC1 knockdown weakened the invasion and migration abilities of SiHa and C-33A cells and decreased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In-vivo experiments suggested that the inhibition of KNTC1 reduced tumor growth. Taken together, our study showed that KNTC1 plays an important role in cervical cancer. Further, we verified the promotional effect of KNTC1 on cervical cancer through in-vivo and in-vitro experiments and speculated that KNTC1 might mediate tumor invasion via MMP9 and MMP2.","170":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high recurrence rate and mortality rate even after surgery. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1B (LRP1B) has proven to be involved in tumor development and progression of multiple malignancies. However, the function of LRP1B in HCC progression has not been fully elucidated. Thus, we conducted this study to explore the relationship between LRP1B and HCC. Bioinformatic analyses implied that LRP1B was highly expressed in HCC tissues. High LRP1B expression was shown to be related to poor outcomes and the determination of HCC patients' tumor stage. LRP1B deletion impeded the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Further investigation demonstrated that silencing LRP1B expression enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to doxorubicin. LRP1B deletion inhibited HCC progression by regulating the PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling pathway. Additionally, we probed the genomic alterations of LRP1B in HCC and the impact on the prognosis of patients. Collectively, our results suggest that LRP1B plays an essential role in the promotion of HCC progression by regulating the PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling pathway, which is a potential prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target of HCC.","171":null,"172":null,"173":null,"174":null,"175":"Sustainable management of natural resources is critical to food security. The shrimp feed and fishery sector is expanding rapidly, necessitating the development of alternative sustainable components. Several factors necessitate the exploration of a new source of environmentally friendly and nutrient-rich fish feed ingredients. Microalgal biomass has the potential to support the growth of fish and shrimp aquaculture for global food security in the bio-economy. Algal biorefineries must valorize the whole crop to develop a viable microalgae-based economy. Microalgae have the potential to replace fish meal and fish oil in aquaculture and ensure sustainability standards. Microalgae biomasses provide essential amino acids, valuable triglycerides such as lipids, vitamins, and pigments, making them suitable as nutritional supplements in livestock feed formulations. Fish and microalgae have similar nutritional profiles, and digestibility is a critical aspect of the aquafeed formulation. A highly digestible feed reduces production costs, feed waste, and the risk of eutrophication. Due to low input costs, low carbon footprint, wastewater treatment benefits, and carbon credits from industrial CO2 conversion, microalgae-based fish and shrimp feeds have the potential to provide significant economic benefits. However, several challenges must be addressed before microalgal biomass and bioproducts may be used as fish feeds, including heavy metal bioaccumulation, poor algal biomass digestion, and antinutrient effects.

In the past decade, the treatment and diagnosis of lung cancer have progressed significantly in early efforts to promote the survival of lung cancer patients. Kruppel like factor 16 (KLF16) is a zinc finger transcription factor that regulates a diverse array of developmental events and cellular processes. KLF16 is involved in the progression of various cancer types. However, the role of KLF16 in the development of lung cancer remains unknown. In this study, KLF16 was overexpressed in lung cancer samples. KLF16 downregulation inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, KLF16 overexpression promoted lung cancer cell growth and invasion. Mechanistically, the expression level LMNB2 was suppressed by KLF16 knockdown and was promoted by KLF16 overexpression. The overall survival of patients with high LMNB2 levels was poor. Luciferase assays showed that KLF16 promoted the transcription activity of LMNB2 gene. Concomitantly, the expression level of LMNB2 was also higher in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) than in normal tissues, and its knockdown or overexpression can reverse the effect of KLF16 overexpression or knockdown on lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and even tumorigenesis, indicating that LMNB2 also functions as an oncogene.

Knockdown of circSIRT1 ameliorated rat PH, suppressed PASMC proliferation, migration with autophagy in hypoxic environment. CircSIRT1 competitively combined with miR-145-5p to mediate Akt3. To sum up, circSIRT1\/miR-145-5p\/Akt3 was supposed to perform as a prospective molecular target for the treatment of PH.","192":"Propofol offers important protective effects in ischemia\/reperfusion-induced cardiomyocyte injury, but its specific mechanisms in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity have not been investigated. In this paper, we attempted to explore the effects of propofol on DOX-induced human cardiomyocyte injury and its related mechanisms. H9c2 cell viability was assessed by cell counting kit-8 and lactate dehydrogenase assay kit. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)\/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) signaling pathway-related protein levels were measured by Western blot. Ferroptosis was evaluated by corresponding kits and Western blot and apoptosis was detected by CCK-8, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling and Western blot. Oxidative stress was assessed by reactive oxygen species kit and the commercial kits, and inflammation response was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The results showed that propofol attenuated DOX-induced cytotoxicity and activated Nrf2\/GPx4 signaling pathways in H9c2 cells. In addition, propofol also alleviated DOX-induced ferroptosis, increased cell viability and inhibited apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in H9c2 cells through activation of Nrf2\/GPx4 signaling pathways. In summary, propofol provides the protection against DOX-induced cardiomyocyte injury by activating Nrf2\/GPx4 signaling, providing a new approach and theoretical basis for the repair of cardiomyocytes.","193":null,"194":"Currently, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the leading causes of human health issues worldwide. The sudden and continuous occlusion of the coronary artery results in myocardial hypoxic-ischemic necrosis, which is accompanied by inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis, leading to pathological cardiac remodeling. Exosome-based therapy is a promising cell-free approach for repairing the ischemic myocardium. This study aimed to explore the effects and mechanism of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)-derived exosomes on AMI. The results indicated that the localized injection of HUVECs-derived exosomes in the infarcted area could significantly improve cardiac function in AMI mouse models. It could also ameliorate myocardial fibrosis and decrease infarct size after AMI. Additionally, HUVECs-derived exosomes had cardioprotective effects on the H9C2 cells in hypoxic culture conditions, including increased cell viability and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. In both the in-vivo and in-vitro experiments, HUVECs-derived exosomes could effectively inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The low expression levels of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and cleaved caspase-3, high expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K), and phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) were detected in AMI mouse models treated with HUVECs-derived exosomes in-vivo. In conclusion, HUVECs-derived exosomes effectively enhanced cardiac function after AMI and inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which might be regulated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\/ protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway.","195":null,"196":"Nephroblastoma, or Wilms tumor, is a primary renal malignant tumor that easily occurs in children. Previous studies have revealed the regulatory functions of LncRNA in nephroblastoma. LncRNA HAGLROS functions as a tumor promotor in various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer. In this study, the HAGLROS expression in nephroblastoma cells was assayed through qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation assessment employed CCK-8. Moreover, the migration and invasion of cells were examined separately through wound healing and transwell assay. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis and Western blot assay were applied to evaluate cell apoptosis. Rapamycin and 3-methyladenine were used to serve as autophagy activator or inhibitor, respectively. In addition, autophagy was identified by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis. Experiment results showed that HAGLROS expressed highly in nephroblastoma cell lines. HAGLROS knockdown prevented cells from proliferating, and also showed suppressive impact on migration and invasion in HFWT cells. In addition, knockdown of HAGLROS showed a facilitative effect on apoptosis and an inhibitory effect on autophagy. Stimulation of autophagy alleviated HAGLROS silencing-induced apoptosis, while inhibition of autophagy reversed the effect in nephroblastoma cells. In summary, our results revealed that HAGLROS executed an oncogenic role in the progress of nephroblastoma, offering a new perspective on the strategy for nephroblastoma therapy.","197":"A completely confluent endothelial cell (EC) monolayer is required to maintain proper vascular function in small diameter tissue-engineered vascular graft (TEVG). However, the most effective method for EC attachment to the luminal surface and formation of an entire endothelium layer that works in vitro remains a complicated challenge that requires urgent resolution. Although pulsatile flow has been shown to be better suited for the generation of functional endothelium, the optimal frequency setting is unknown. Several pulsatile flow frequencies were used to implant rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into the lumen of decellularized porcine carotid arteries. The endothelium's integrity and cell activity were investigated in order to determine the best pulse frequency settings. The results showed that MSC were maximally preserved and exhibited maximal morphological changes with improved endothelialization performance in response to increased pulse stimulation frequency. Increased pulse frequency stimulation stimulates the expression of mechanoreceptor markers, cytoskeleton reorganization in the direction of blood flow, denser skeletal proteins fibronectin, and stronger intercellular connections when compared to constant pulse frequency stimulation. MSC eventually develops an intact endothelial layer with anti-thrombotic properties on the inner wall of the decellularized tubular lumen. Conclusion: The decellularized vessels retain the three-dimensional structure of the vasculature, have a surface topography suitable for MSC growth, and have good mechanical properties. By increasing the frequency of pulsed stimulation, MSC endothelialize the lumen of the decellularized vasculature. It is expected to have anti-thrombotic and anti-neointimal hyperplasia properties after implantation, ultimately improving the patency of TEVG.","198":"It has been reported that transmembrane protein 100 (TMEM100) acts as a tumor regulator in several types of cancers. However, whether the expression of TMEM100 is associated with the development and prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa) remains elusive. Therefore, the present study aimed to uncover the role of GATA binding protein 5 (GATA5)-mediated activation of TMEM100 in the proliferation, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PCa cells. The expressions of TMEM100 and GATA5 in PCa patients were analyzed by the GEPIA database. The binding site of GATA5 and TMEM100 promoter was predicted by the JASPAR database. Expressions of TMEM100 and GATA5 in PCa cells were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell Counting Kit 8 and colony formation assays were performed to measure cell proliferation. In addition, cell migration, invasion and the expression of EMT-associated proteins were evaluated using wound healing, transwell assay and Western blotting assays, respectively. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that TMEM100 was downregulated in PCa and was associated with overall survival of PCa. In addition, TMEM10 overexpression attenuated cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in PCa cells. The interaction between TMEM100 and GATA5 was verified using dual luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, the results showed that GATA5 was downregulated and GATA5 silencing reversed the inhibitory effects of TMEM10 on PCa cells. Overall, the current study suggested that the GATA5-mediated transcriptional activation of TMEM100 could affect the behavior of PCa cells and was associated with poor prognosis in PCa.","199":"Bladder cancer (BC) is the most frequent type of urinary tumor and a barely treatable disease. Although extensive efforts have been invested in the research of BC, the underlying etiology and pathophysiology remain unclear. CircLONP2 is a circular RNA implicated in the development of many cancers, and miR-584-5p and YAP1 have been reported to contribute to the progression of BC. In this research, we presented novel evidence supporting circLONP2\/miR-584-5p\/YAP1 axis as a novel regulatory module in the progression of BC. We analyzed the expression of circLONP2 between precancerous BC samples and normal tissues using a published RNA-seq dataset. The expression of circLONP2 was also validated in clinical samples and cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and miRNA inhibitor was utilized to modulate the expression of circLONP2 and miR-584-5p and investigate their functions on cell proliferation and invasion. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down were performed to confirm the functional interactions among circLONP2\/miR-584-5p\/YAP1. CircLONP2 was significantly upregulated in precancerous BC tissues and BC cells. CircLONP2 depletion inhibited cell viability, proliferation, and invasion of BC cell lines, which could be partially rescued by miR-584-5p inhibitor. Further experiments indicated that miR-584-5p regulates cell viability, proliferation, and invasion via directly targeting YAP1. In summary, our work indicates that circLONP2 plays an oncogenic function in BC by regulating miR-584-5p\/YAP1 axis, and its interaction with miR-584-5p provides a potential strategy to target BC.","200":"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in tumor progression regulation, including osteosarcoma. Evidence indicates that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification modulates mRNA stability to regulate osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. Here, present research aims to detect the roles of m6A-modified lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 in the osteosarcoma pathophysiological process. Clinical data unveiled that osteosarcoma patients with higher FOXD2-AS1 expression had a poorer overall survival rate compared to those with lower FOXD2-AS1 expression. Functional research illuminated that FOXD2-AS1 accelerated the migration, proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, a remarkable m6A-modified site was found on the 3'-UTR of FOXD2-AS1, and m6A methyltransferase WTAP (Wilms' tumor 1 associated protein) promoted the methylation modification, thus enhancing the stability of FOXD2-AS1 transcripts. Furthermore, FOXD2-AS1 interacted with downstream target FOXM1 mRNA through m6A sites, forming a FOXD2-AS1\/m6A\/FOXM1 complex to heighten FOXM1 mRNA stability. In conclusion, these findings propose a novel regulatory mechanism in which m6A-modified FOXD2-AS1 accelerates the osteosarcoma progression through m6A manner, which may provide new concepts for osteosarcoma tumorigenesis.","201":null,"202":null,"203":"The exosomes (Exo) had always been considered as transport vectors for microRNA (miRNA). An increasing number of data had clarified the influence of Exo on the cell progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, its specific mechanism had not yet been verified. This work was to explore the potential mechanism of Exo-derived miR-631 targeting and regulating E2F family of transcription factor 2 (E2F2) to repress the malignant behavior of NSCLC cells. Test of microRNA (miR)-631 and E2F2 in NSCLC was performed. BMSCs-Exo that altered miR-631 was co-cultured with NSCLC cells. Detection of the cloning and progression of NSCLC cells was performed. Testification of the targeting of miR-631 with E2F2 was conducted. In vivo experiments were performed to verify the results in vitro. In short, elevation of miR-631 Exo repressed the advancement and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase\/Akt activation of NSCLC cells, while silence of miR-631 was in the opposite. In terms of mechanism, miR-631 exerted the influence via targeting E2F2. The coincident results were obtained in animal models. In brief, BMSC-Exo mediated E2F2 via delivering miR-631 to NSCLC cells to modulate the malignant behavior of NSCLC.","204":null,"205":"MiRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs are implicated in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms how these miRNAs regulate cardiac hypertrophy is useful for diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. In this study, to investigate the effect of miR-27a-3p, we established an in vitro cardiac hypertrophy model by treating H9c2 cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II (Ang II) and an in vivo model through the chronic infusion of Ang II into mice. As revealed by our experimental results, miR-27a-3p expression was significantly increased in clinical samples, animal and cell models of cardiac hypertrophy. Inhibiting miR-27a-3p mitigated cardiac hypertrophy phenotype induced by Ang II. Additionally, our work identified NOVA1 (neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1) as a downstream target of miR-27a-3p. miR-27a-3p overexpression reduced NOVA1 protein level and mRNA expression. Consistently, NOVA1 silencing promoted cardiac hypertrophy phenotype induced by Ang II. In summary, these results suggest that the upregulation of miR-27a-3p may serve as a diagnostic factor for cardiac hypertrophy, and miR-27a-3p upregulation promotes cardiac hypertrophy by targeting NOVA1.","206":null,"207":"Gastric cancer (GC) is lethal malignancy, which is associated with high mortality. Long noncoding RNA LINC01270 has been identified to act as a potential oncogene in several cancers. However, its role and related regulatory mechanism in GC are yet to be illustrated. The levels of lncRNA LINC01270, miR-326, and EphrinA3 (EFNA3) were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays were applied for analyzing cell proliferation. Transwell assay was used for measuring cellular migration and invasion. Western blot analysis was employed for evaluating the protein levels. Luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays were utilized to verify the binding ability between LINC01270 (or EFNA3) and miR-326. Our findings indicated that LINC01270 expression was significantly up-regulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Additionally, LINC01270 knockdown attenuated GC progression through inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Functional experiments identified that lncRNA LINC01270 could positively regulate EFNA3 expression by serving as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-326. Through rescue assays, inhibition of GC progression caused by LINC01270 suppression was found to be reversed by the application of miR-326 inhibitor or EFNA3 overexpression.

This study aimed to distinguish three cultivars of asparagus (Paladin, Grace, and Jinggang red) based on their volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and metabolic profiles. VOCs in the three cultivars were separated and identified using electronic nose (E-nose) and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). Differences in metabolites among the three cultivars were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). E-nose and GC-IMS showed that the VOCs in asparagus differed significantly among the three groups. E-nose result showed that purple asparagus (Jinggang red) was connected to a stronger earthy odor; green asparagus (Paladin and Grace) were shown characteristic dill flavor. Moreover, 50 VOCs were detected by using GC-IMS. Ketones and alcohols were most abundant in Paladin; methyl benzoate and dimethyl sulfide were most abundance in Grace; aldehydes and acids were most abundance in Jinggang red. Moreover, 130 and 71 different metabolites were detected in the positive and negative modes among three cultivars, such as quercetin and rutin. Functional analysis revealed that these metabolites were involved in beta-alanine metabolism and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. In summary, E-nose combined with GC-IMS and LC-MS\/MS methods has good application prospects in evaluating and identifying VOCs and metabolites of different cultivars of asparagus. The identified VOCs and metabolites can provide guidelines for the development of functional asparagus products.","209":"Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in females with high incidence and mortality. Actin-binding Rho activating C-terminal like (ABRACL) was highly expressed in several cancers. We aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of ABRACL in breast cancer. In this study, biological information analysis predicted the expression of ABRACL and MYB proto-oncogene-like 2 (MYBL2) in breast cancer tissues and their possible relationship. With the application of RT-qPCR and western blot, the mRNA and protein expression of ABRACL and MYBL2 in breast cancer cell lines were assessed. After ABRACL interference, an assessment of cell proliferation was carried out using cell counting kit (CCK)-8, colony formation, and western blot. The invasive and migratory abilities of cells were determined by transwell and wound healing assays. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process was assayed utilizing western blot. The relationship between ABRACL and MYBL2 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The above experiments were done again after MYBL2 overexpression in breast cancer cells with ABRACL deletion. Results revealed that ABRACL and MYBL2 were highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and cells. ABRACL knockdown suppressed the proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT of breast cancer cells. MYBL2 transcriptionally activated ABRACL. Besides, MYBL2 overexpression reversed the effects of ABRACL knockdown on cell malignant biological behaviors. To conclude, ABRACL could be transcriptionally regulated by MYBL2 to promote cell malignant biological behaviors in breast cancer cells, implying the potential of ABRACL being a promising target for the improvement of breast cancer therapy.","210":null,"211":null,"212":"MicroRNA-200c (miR-200c) generally acts as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancer types and a promising therapeutic target in tumorigenesis. However, only a few studies have explained the role of miR-200c in the development of osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, we investigated the role of miR-200c in OS progression and identified the regulatory pathway protein NDN involved in inhibiting the occurrence and development of OS. Firstly, we found that miR-200c is downregulated in OS cells and tissues. As well, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that upregulating miR-200c inhibits the proliferation, invasion, metastasis of Saos-2 cells, promotes the apoptosis of Saos-2 cells and suppresses tumor growth in mice, indicating miR-200c plays a major role in regulating the OS progression. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis showed that an anti-tumor protein, necdin (NDN), might be a potential target by miR-200c. To verify this hypothesis, we measured the expression level of NDN in OS cells and tissues and found NDN is downregulated, suggesting NDN is functional in OS progression. Moreover, we found that the expression levels of NDN and miR-200c in in vivo and in vitro experiments were positively correlated. However, the results of dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment showed miR-200c does not directly act on the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of NDN gene, indicating that NDN might be an important pathway protein which regulates OS progression in the presence of miR-200c. Therefore, miR-200c\/NDN could be potential targets for developing effective treatment against OS.","213":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various processes from the initiation and development of cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this report, we aimed to investigate the roles of miR-23a in the regulation of imatinib mesylate (IM) sensitivity in CML cells and the possible mechanisms involved in this process. We demonstrated that the expression of miR-23a was markedly low in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients in whom IM treatment had failed and imatinib-resistant K562\/G01 cells when compared to patients with optimal responses and imatinib-sensitive K562 cells, respectively. Overexpression of miR-23a was shown to induce apoptosis of K562\/G01 cells and sensitize these cells to imatinib treatment. With the aid of bioinformatics analysis, we revealed that CRYAB could be a potential downstream effector of miR-23a, contributing to miR-23a-mediated IM resistance. We also observed that the expression of CRYAB was inversely correlated with miR-23a expression in CML cell lines and patient samples. Importantly, chidamide upregulated miR-23a expression and reversed the IM resistance of CML cells. Together, these findings strongly suggest that miR-23a acts as a tumor suppressor by downregulating CRYAB expression. Restoration of miR-23a by chidamide may therefore have a therapeutic effect in controlling the sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib.","214":"LOX-1 triggers myocardial fibrosis, but its roles and mechanisms in alcoholic cardiomyopathy and the involvement of the downstream signaling pathways had not been fully reported. We planned to explore how LOX-1 facilitated myocardial fibrosis in alcoholic cardiomyopathy. The in vitro and in vivo alcoholic cardiomyopathy model was established by alcohol treatment to rats' cardiac fibroblasts and rats, respectively. Masson staining was conducted to observe the collagen deposition and the IHC assay was executed to evaluate the contents of collagen I and III in vitro and in vivo. The cardiac tissues were also observed under TEM and the cardiac function of rats was evaluated using UCG. The expression levels of LOX-1 and P38MAPK in cardiac fibroblasts and tissues at both mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blot, respectively. Alcohol treatment could trigger collagen deposition, cell hypertrophy, fibrotic changes and increased the expression levels of LOX-1 and P38MAPK both in vivo and in vitro. It also deteriorated the cardiac function of rats in vivo. Overexpression of LOX-1 in vitro could aggravate the fibrotic changes while knockdown of LOX-1 ameliorated the fibrotic effects of alcohol treatment both in vitro and in vivo such as reduction of collagen deposition, relief of cell hypertrophy and inactivation of the P38MAPK signaling pathway. We concluded that knockdown of LOX-1 exerted anti-fibrotic effects via inhibiting P38MAPK signaling in alcoholic cardiomyopathy both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlighted that LOX-1 could become a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.","215":"Circular RNA (circRNA) circ_0008717 has been revealed to promote cell carcinogenesis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The interaction between miR-1287-5p and circ_0008717 or PAK2 was investigated. The phenotypes of NSCLC cells with circ_0008717 downregulation were tested. Circ_0008717 was highly expressed in NSCLC. Functionally, circ_0008717 deficiency suppressed cell malignant phenotypes in NSCLC in vitro and in nude mice. Circ_0008717 sponged miR-1287-5p to elevate PAK2, a downstream target of miR-1287-5p. Silencing of miR-1287-5p blocked the antitumor effects of circ_0008717 knockdown in NSCLC cells. Besides, miR-1287-5p repressed cell oncogenic behaviors in NSCLC by targeting PAK2. Besides that, we confirmed that circ_0008717 was incorporated into exosomes in NSCLC cells.

First of all, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot examined the expression of SHMT2 and ILF2 in OSCC cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays appraised cell proliferation. Terminal-deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Mediated Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) staining was to estimate the apoptotic rate of cells. Further, wound healing and transwell assays verified the migration and invasion of cells. Western blot was adopted to detect the expression of factors related to apoptosis, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The possible interaction of SHMT2 and ILF2 was predicted by a Molecular INTeraction (MINT) and BioGRID databases and determined using co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. Subsequently, ILF2 was overexpressed to investigate whether SHMT2 regulated OSCC progression by binding to ILF2. Results implied that SHMT2 possessed increased expression in OSCC cells, and OSCC cell viability, migration, invasion, EMT were inhibited and apoptosis was potentiated after its silencing. ILF2 bound to SHMT2 and ILF2 expression was downregulated after SHMT2 silencing in OSCC cells.

Meanwhile, the protein expression of collagen II in LPS-induced NPCs was measured by western blot. Then, the experiments following the treatment of KuA in LPS-induced NPCs included cell proliferation assessment by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) kit, cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation (ECM) analysis by Terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and western blot, the detection of inflammatory cytokines by western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), P13K\/Akt pathway-related protein levels analysis by western blot. Finally, after the addition of P13K\/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002, cell apoptosis, ECM and inflammation in KuA-treated NPCs induced by LPS were again examined by the same methods. Results indicated that KuA prevented loss of cell viability and attenuated the apoptosis, ECM, and inflammation in LPS-induced NPCs. Furthermore, western blot experiment verified the activation of KuA on P13K\/Akt pathway in LPS-induced NPCs. However, inhibition of P13K\/Akt pathway reversed the roles of KuA in LPS-induced NPCs. Thus, KuA attenuates LPS-induced apoptosis, ECM and inflammation in LPS-induced NPCs by activating the P13K\/Akt pathway.","220":"Increasing population, industrialization, and economic growth cause several adverse impacts on the existing environment and living being.

CSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed with functional assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing and Transwell assays. Our data confirmed that miR-125a is expressed at low levels in CSCC tissues and cells. Functionally, the overexpression of miR-125a greatly prevented the proliferation, migration and invasion of CSCC cells, and the inhibition of miR-125a expression strongly enhanced these behaviors in CSCC cells. Moreover, the expression of Rad51, a miR-125a target gene, greatly reversed the miR-125-mediated inhibition of CSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, we discovered that miR-125a downregulated the levels of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT and mTOR through Rad51 in CSCC cells. miR-125a, a tumor suppressor, can attenuate the malignant behaviors of CSCC cells by targeting Rad51.

Increasing studies have implicated that Hyp may serve as a predominant promoting factor in osteoblast differentiation. This paper investigates whether Hyp could relieve glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GONFH) via promoting osteoblast survival and differentiation as well as to uncover its potential mechanism. GONFH cell model was induced by treating MC3T3-E1 cells with dexamethasone (DEX). The viability, apoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation of DEX-induced cells with the presence or absence of Hyp were assessed by CCK-8, Tunel, ALP assay, and ARS staining, respectively. The NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4) overexpression was performed by transfection with overexpression vector. Besides, western blot was used to determine the levels of apoptosis-, osteogenic differentiation-, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling-related proteins. It was noticed that Hyp caused no significant effects on the viability of MC3T3-E1 cells without any treatment but significantly enhanced the viability of DEX-induced cells. Besides, Hyp inhibited the apoptosis in DEX-induced cells but enhanced ALP activity and calcium nodule formation. Additionally, Hyp declined NOX4 expression in DEX-induced cells. However, NOX4 overexpression partially reversed the impacts of Hyp on DEX-exposed MC3T3-E1 cells. Finally, Hyp suppressed the activation of ROS\/JNK pathway in DEX-induced cells, which was then counteracted by NOX4 overexpression. In conclusion, Hyp could promote the survival and differentiation of DEX-induced osteoblasts by targeting NOX4 to inhibit the ROS\/JNK pathway. These results provide evidence for the application of Hyp in treating GONFH.","224":null,"225":null,"226":null,"227":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely recognized as critical players in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one of the most prevalent liver diseases globally.

This study aimed to investigate the biofunction of lncRNA RPSAP52 in GC. Quantitative polymerase-chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was employed to analyze the gene level of lncRNA RPSAP52 and miR-665. Cell proliferation capacity was evaluated via CCK-8 and colony formation assay. Flow cytometry was applied to detect cell cycle and cell apoptosis. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was conducted for histopathological analysis. Immunochemical staining was carried out to detect expression level of ki-67. Subcellular fractionation was performed to explore the position of lncRNA RPSAP52. The binding relationship among lncRNA RPSAP52, miR-665 and STAT3 was verified via luciferase reporter assay. RNA pull down experiments were used to verify the binding relationship between lncRNA RPSAP52 and miR-665. The STAT3 level was evaluated via Western blot. LncRNA RPSAP52 is significantly elevated in GC cells. Deletion of lncRNA RPSAP52 restrained cell proliferation and induced G0-G1 phase arrest, while expediting apoptosis in GC cells.

Chitosan derivatives are widely used to treat chronic wounds due to their excellent hydrophilicity, biodegradability, and antimicrobial activity and substantial contribution to tissue regeneration. However, the antimicrobial effect of chitosan is not sufficient due to the complicated pathological mechanism of diabetes mellitus. Here, we prepared carboxymethyl chitosan-grafted polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (CMC-g-PVPI) microspheres and used them to treat chronic wounds. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) was used as the skeleton and was grafted with polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (PVPI) to form a CMC-g-PVPI complex hydrogel and CMC-g-PVPI microspheres, which formed as a result of the high shearing dispersion of the complex hydrogel. In vivo experiments on diabetic wounds revealed significantly accelerated wound closure in the presence of the microspheres, demonstrating the excellent potential of CMC-g-PVPI to promote skin wound regeneration under diabetic conditions.","232":"Terpinen-4-ol (T4O), a compound isolated from the seeds of turmeric, has exhibited anti-malignancy, anti-aging, and anti-inflammatory properties in previous studies. However, the specific effects and molecular mechanisms of T4O on pancreatic cancer (PC) cells remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that T4O markedly suppressed PC cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and induced apoptosis. Similarly, T4O significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of PC cells in vitro. Through RNA sequencing, 858 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, which were enriched in the Rhodopsin (RHO)\/ Ras homolog family member A (RHOA) signaling pathway. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2), a DEG enriched in the RHO\/RHOA signaling pathway, was considered as a key target of T4O in PC cells; it was significantly reduced after T4O treatment, highly expressed in PC tissues, and negatively associated with patient outcome. Overexpression of ROCK2 significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of T4O on PC cell proliferation and mobility. Moreover, T4O inhibited cell proliferation in vivo and decreased the Ki-67, cell nuclear antigen, EMT markers, and ROCK2 expression. In conclusion, we consider that T4O can suppress the malignant biological behavior of PC by reducing the expression of ROCK2, thus contributing to PC therapy.","233":null,"234":null,"235":null,"236":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy in the world, with high mortality and poor prognosis.

The purpose of this study was to explore the expression changes of microRNA-486-5p in the serum of patients with CAS and its possible mechanism. Ninety-one cases with asymptomatic CAS were recruited, and serum levels of miR-486-5p were measured using RT-qPCR. The diagnostic ability was evaluated by drawing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) to establish cell model, and cell proliferation and apoptosis were tested. The markers of cell inflammation and oxidative stress were detected via ELISA. The target gene was analyzed using bioinformatics analysis combined with luciferase reporting assay. CAS cases exhibited significantly low serum miR-486-5p levels in comparison with the control group and can identify asymptomatic CAS. Serum miR-486-5p manifested a negative correlation with the degree of carotid stenosis. Underexpression of miR-486-5p was also detected in ox-LDL treated HAECs. OxLDL treatment contributes to inflammatory response and oxidative stress of HAECs; however, these adverse impacts caused by ox-LDL were reversed by miR-486-5p upregulation. NFAT5 was confirmed to be the target gene of miR-486-5p in HAECs. MiR-486-5p serves as a promising biomarker for the early identification of CAS. Overexpression of miR-486-5p can prevent endothelial dysfunction, and the mechanism might be related to anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation via targeting NFAT5.","238":"To observe the application of two instruments for the quantitative detection of total chlorine in the water in the hemodialysis industry, thereby evaluating the accuracy of the two tools and the consistency of their results, and evaluating their practical significance for the safety of hemodialysis treatment.

Currently, the combination of chemotherapy with subsequent irradiation is a regular therapeutic strategy. However, high dosage of chemotherapy is associated with drug resistance and side effects. The long non-coding RNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), which is frequently overexpressed in diverse human tumors, is correlated with worse survival rate in cancer patients. Currently, the precise roles of NEAT1 in MB and chemoresistance remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the biological functions of NEAT1 in cisplatin-resistant medulloblastoma. We report that NEAT1 was significantly upregulated in medulloblastoma patient specimens. Silencing NEAT1 significantly suppressed MB cell proliferation and sensitized MB cells to cisplatin. In cisplatin-resistant MB cell line, DAOY Cis R, NEAT1 expression, and glutamine metabolism were remarkably upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells. Under low glutamine supply, cisplatin-resistant cells displayed increased cisplatin sensitivity. Bioinformatical analysis and luciferase assay uncovered that NEAT1 functions as a ceRNA of miR-23a-3p to downregulate its expressions in MB cells. Moreover, miR-23a-3p was apparently downregulated in MB patient tissues and cisplatin resistant MB cells. We identified GLS (glutaminase), a glutamine metabolism enzyme, was directly targeted by miR-23a-3p in MB cells. Rescue experiments demonstrated restoration of miR-23a-3p in NEAT1-overexpressing DAOY cisplatin resistant cells successfully overcame the NEAT1-promoted cisplatin resistance by targeting GLS.

In this study, we aimed to explore new substrates of the UBE2B\/RAD18 complex and their regulatory effects in ovarian cancer. Protein physical interactions were predicted using GeneMANIA. Serial sections of commercial ovarian cancer tissue arrays were used to check the protein expression of UBE2B, RAD18, and ZMYM2. Immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to check their location and interactions. Cycloheximide chase assay was applied to explore the influence of UBE2B and RAD18 on ZMYM2 degradation. Xenograft tumor models were constructed to assess the influence of the UBE2B-ZMYM2 axis on in vivo tumor growth. A strong positive correlation between UBE2B and ZMYM2 and a moderate positive correlation between RAD18 and ZMYM2 were observed in 23 ovarian cancer cases. In CAOV4 and OVCAR3 cells, myc-ZMYM2 interacted with UBE2B and RAD18. UBE2B and ZMYM2 could be detected in the samples immunoprecipitated by anti-RAD18. UBE2B overexpression or knockdown did not alter ZMYM2 mRNA expression. UBE2B overexpression increased ZMYM2 monoubiquitination but reduced its polyubiquitination. RAD18 knockdown impaired UBE2B-induced ZMYM2 monoubiquitination. UBE2B overexpression significantly enhanced the stability of ZMYM2 protein, the effect of which was weakened by RAD18 knockdown. UBE2B overexpression significantly enhanced the growth of xenograft tumors derived from CAOV4 cells. ZMYM2 knockdown remarkedly suppressed tumor growth and impaired the growth-promoting effect of UBE2B overexpression. In conclusion, this study revealed a novel regulatory effect of the UBE2B\/RAD18 complex on ZMYM2 monoubiquitination and stability in ovarian cancer.","244":"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a highly conserved endogenous peptide in the central and peripheral nervous systems, which has been implicated in nociceptive signaling in neuropathic pain. However, downstream mechanistic actions remain uncharacterized. In this study, we sought to investigate the mechanism of NPY and its receptor NPY2R in the amygdala in rats with neuropathic pain-like behaviors induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. The expression of NPY and NPY2R was found to be aberrantly up-regulated in neuropathic pain-related microarray dataset. Further, NPY was found to act on NPY2R in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). As reflected by the decrease in mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) as well as the increase of NPY expression in the amygdala of rats with neuropathic pain-like behaviors, NPY was closely related to the effect of amygdala nerve activity in neuropathic pain. Subsequently, mechanistic investigations indicated that NPY2R activated the MAPK signaling pathway in the amygdala. NPY2R-induced decrease of MWT and TWL were also restored in the presence of MAPK signaling pathway antagonist. Moreover, it was revealed that NPY2R overexpression promoted the viability while inhibiting the apoptosis of microglia. Taken together, NPY in the amygdala interacts with NPY2R to activate the MAPK signaling pathway, thereby promoting the occurrence of neuropathic pain.","245":"The purpose of this research was to explore the diagnostic\/prognostic significance and prospective molecular mechanisms of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Various bioinformatics tools were used to explore the biological functions of prognosis-related genes. Subsequently, molecular biology assays were used to verify the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of specific gene. MAP3K9 was observed to be differentially expressed in HCC and adjacent tissues with satisfactory diagnostic value.

The expression of NR4A1 and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)\/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway-related proteins (LKB1, AMPK, and ACC) was detected by western blotting or RT-qPCR under H\/R condition after NR4A1 overexpression or silencing. Then, radicicol, an inhibitor of LKB1 pathway, was used to determine the role of NR4A1 in hepatocyte H\/R injury by regulating LKB1. Under the help of CCK-8 assay, cell viability was assessed. The levels of ROS, MDA, and SOD were determined with corresponding kits to evaluate oxidative stress. Additionally, RT-qPCR was employed to analyze the releases of the inflammatory factors. Flow cytometry was applied to estimate the apoptosis and its related proteins, and autophagy-associated proteins were assayed by western blotting.

This study aimed to investigate whether long non-coding RNA ADAMTS9-AS1 (ADAMTS9-AS1) could regulate solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) expression and inhibit ferroptosis by sponging micoRNA-587 in EOC progression. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting results showed that ADAMTS9-AS1 expression was elevated in EOC cells; microRNA-587 expression was up-regulated and SLC7A11 expression was down-regulated after knocking down ADAMTS9-AS1 by transfection with siRNAs; however, microRNA-587 inhibitor reversed SLC7A11 expression in ADAMTS9-AS1 knocking down cells. Ferroptosis related marker detection and cell function assay confirmed that knocking down ADAMTS9-AS1 inhibited EOC cells proliferation and migration by promoting ferroptosis. Overexpression of micoRNA-587 also promoted ferroptosis while inhibited cells proliferation and migration in EOC cells. Additionally, micoRNA-587 inhibitor reversed the effect of ADAMTS9-AS1 silence on the ferroptosis and cell function. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that miR-587 was as a sponge for ADAMTS9-AS1 and SLC7A11.

The expression levels of circ_0072008, microRNA-1305 (miR-1305) and mRNA of HELLS (helicase, lymphoid specific) were detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in CESC tissues. Meanwhile, the level of HELLS was quantified by western blot analysis. Besides, the cell functions were examined by colony formation assay, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry assay and western blot. Furthermore, the interaction between miR-1305 and circ_0072008 or HELLS was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The function of circ_0072008 in CESC has also been further verified in vivo by xenograft model experiments. The levels of circ_0072008 and HELLS were upregulated, and the miR-1305 level was decreased in CESC tissues in contrast to that in normal tissues. For functional analysis, silencing circ_0072008 inhibited cell proliferation and cell migration, whereas enhanced cell apoptosis in CESC cells. In mechanism, circ_0072008 acted as a miR-1305 sponge to regulate the level of HELLS. Moreover, miR-1305 was confirmed to repress the progression of CESC cells by suppressing HELLS. Meanwhile, knockdown of circ_0072008 inhibited CESC cells growth in vivo.

However, the effect of AS-IV on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains unclear. In this study, high glucose (HG) was shown to promote ARPE-19 RPE cell death, increase the contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and enhance lipid peroxidation density of mitochondrial membrane. In contrast, AS-IV decreased glutathione (GSH) content, mitochondria size and ridge. Addition of iron death inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) to RPE cells decreased cell dead rate, thus indicating that HG-induced mitochondrial damage occurred due to ferroptosis. AS-IV alleviated HG-induced RPE cell damage. Furthermore, HG decreased levels of silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) in the nucleus of RPE cells; AS-IV could alleviate these effects and increased expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLM) and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), which are Nrf2 downstream genes. Mechanistically, AS-IV was shown to alleviate the effects of HG by increasing mir-138-5p expression in RPE cells and promoting expression of Sirt1 and Nrf2 in the nucleus. Transfection of mir-138-5p agonist inhibited the regulatory effects of AS-IV on Sirt1 and Nrf2, accompanied by decreased GPX4, GCLM and GCLC levels, and restoration of ferroptosis-related changes. Collectively, HG increased ferroptosis rate in RPE cells.

We found that MiR-124-3p expression downregulates in HCC. Overexpression of miR-124-3p reduced the HCC cell proliferation and EMT. Meanwhile, we determined that the expression of ARRDC1 is increased in HCC, and miR-124-3p directly binds the 3'UTR of ARRDC1 and inhibits its expression at mRNA and protein level, suggesting that miR-124-3p was capable of negatively modulating ARRDC1. Besides, cotransfection of ARRDC1-overexpression plasmid and miR-124-3p mimics increased the cell proliferation and EMT as compared to miR-124-3p mimics. Our study concluded that miR-124-3p directly binds the 3'UTR of ARRDC1 and exerts anti-tumorous effects by inhibiting the HCC proliferation and EMT.

The discharge of synthetic dye into various aquatic environments has a detrimental effect on the balance and integrity of ecological systems. Moreover, numerous inorganic dyes exhibit tolerance to degradation and repair by natural and conventional processes. So, the present condition requires the development of efficient and effective waste management systems that do not exacerbate environmental stress or endanger other living forms. Numerous biological systems, including microbes and plants, have been studied for their ability to metabolize dyestuffs. To minimize environmental impact, bioremediation uses endophytic bacteria, which are plant beneficial bacteria that dwell within plants and may improve plant development in both normal and stressful environments. Moreover, Phytoremediation is suitable for treating dye contaminants produced from a wide range of sources. This review article proves a comprehensive evaluation of the most frequently utilized plant and microbes as dye removal technologies from dye-containing industrial effluents. Furthermore, this study examines current existing technologies and proposes a more efficient, cost-effective method for dye removal and decolorization on a big scale. This study also aims to focus on advanced degradation techniques combined with biological approaches, well regarded as extremely effective treatments for recalcitrant wastewater, with the greatest industrial potential.","275":"Colon cancer is a highly malignant tumor in the digestive system. LEM domain containing 1 (LEMD1) is supposed to be a survival marker of poor prognosis in colon cancer. We aimed to explore the role and mechanism of LEMD1 in colon cancer progression. GEPIA database analyzed LEMD1 expression in colon cancer tissues and prognosis of colon cancer patients. LEMD1 expression in tumor cells was tested by RT-qPCR and western blotting. Proliferation of colon cancer cells was estimated by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. Transwell and wound healing assays were used to appraise the cell invasion and migration. Meanwhile, tube formation assays were used to evaluate angiogenesis. The possible binding sites between SRY-related high-mobility-group box 4 (SOX4) and LEMD1 were predicted by JASPAR database. Besides, SOX4 expression in colon cancer tissues and the correlation between SOX4 and LEMD1 were examined using the GEPIA database. Luciferase reporter and ChIP assays were used to verify the interaction between SOX4 and LEMD1. The expression of proteins in PI3K\/Akt signaling was evaluated by western blotting. LEMD1 was overexpressed in colon cancer tissues and cells and associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, LEMD1 deficiency impeded the proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of colon cancer cells. Additionally, SOX4 had a positive correlation with LEMD1 and could bind to LEMD1 promoter. Rescue assays validated that SOX4 elevation reversed the suppressive role of LEMD1 deletion in the development of colon cancer and the expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT. Collectively, LEMD1 induced by SOX4 drove the progression of colon cancer by activating PI3K\/Akt signaling.","276":"The present study aimed at investigating the effects and mechanism of long noncoding RNA highly upregulated in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer lymph node (lncRNA HUMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the expression of HUMT, microRNA (miR)-455-5p, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) in HCC tissues. Colony forming and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays were performed to assess cell proliferation. Transwell assay was performed to measure cell migration and invasion. Cell cycle distribution was assessed using flow cytometry. The protein expression of LRP4, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9 was detected using western blot. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay was used to confirm the target association between miR-455-5p and HUMT or LRP4. In our study, the level of HUMT was enhanced in HCC tissues and cells. Cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in HCC cells were repressed by knockdown of HUMT, and knockdown of HUMT arrested cells in G1 phase and decreased the levels of PCNA, MMP-2, and MMP-9. MiR-455-5p was a target of HUMT. Lowexpression of miR-455-5p reversed the inhibitive influence on HCC cells induced by of HUMT silencing. LRP4 was a target of miR-455-5p and was negatively regulated by miR-455-5p. In addition, LRP4 expression was positively modified by HUMT, and LRP4 inhibited the inhibitory effects on HCC cells induced by HUMT silencing. In conclusion, HCC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were restrained by knockdown of HUMT, which was related to the miR-455-5p\/LRP4 axis.","277":null,"278":"Drug resistance has become the major obstacle for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are tightly linked to the development of drug resistance of NSCLC. Herein, we tested the function of circ_0002360 in the Taxol resistance of NSCLC. Circ_0002360, microRNA (miR)-585-3p and G protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GPRIN1) were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). To identify the circular structure of circ_0002360, RNase R digestion was applied. To detect cell proliferation, colony formation and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were used. For assessment of cell apoptosis, flow cytometry was adopted. For motility and invasion analyses, transwell assay was employed. Our data showed that circ_0002360 was mainly located in the cytoplasm and was highly expressed in the Taxol-resistant NSCLC. Silencing of circ_0002360 inhibited cell Taxol resistance, proliferation, motility, and invasiveness and induced apoptosis in vitro. MiR-585-3p was underexpressed in Taxol-resistant NSCLC and was targeted by circ_0002360. MiR-585-3p knockdown alleviated the influence of circ_0002360 silence on Taxol-resistant cells. GPRIN1 was directly targeted by miR-585-3p. The influence of miR-585-3p on cell Taxol resistance and functional behaviors was reversed by GPRIN1 overexpression. Moreover, circ_0002360 modulated GPRIN1 through miR-585-3p. Additionally, silencing of circ_0002360 weakened the growth of xenografts in vivo. Our study demonstrated that silencing of circ_0002360 enhanced the Taxol sensitivity and suppressed the malignant behaviors of Taxol-resistant NSCLC cells by miR-585-3p\/GPRIN1 axis, providing novel targets for improving the anti-tumor efficacy of Taxol in NSCLC.","279":"Doxorubicin (DOX) has limited antitumor applications owing to its association with life-threatening cardiac injury. Oxidative damage and cardiac apoptosis are crucial in DOX-induced cardiac injury. Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP10) is predominantly distributed in the heart and acts as a cardioprotective factor that preserves cardiac function. However, the role of BMP10 in DOX-induced cardiac injury has not yet been explored. The current study aimed to examine the function and mechanism of action of BMP10 in DOX-induced cardiac injury. An adeno-associated viral system was used for the overexpression or silencing of cardiac-specific BMP10, and subsequently, a single dose of DOX was intraperitoneally injected to induce cardiac injury. Results showed that DOX exposure decreased BMP10 expression in the heart. Cardiac-specific overexpression of BMP10 alleviated the oxidative stress and apoptosis and improved cardiac function. Conversely, cardiac-specific silencing of BMP10 aggravated the redox disorder and apoptosis and worsened the cardiac dysfunction caused by DOX. Exogenous BMP10 supplementation amelioratesd the DOX-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction. Mechanistically, we found that phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is reduced in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and, BMP10 activated impaired STAT3 via a non-canonical pathway. BMP10 lost its cardioprotective function in cardiomyocyte-specific STAT3 knockout (STAT3-cKO) mice. Based on our findings, we suggested that BMP10 is a potential therapeutic agent against DOX-induced cardiac injury and that the cardioprotective effects of BMP10 are dependent on the activation of STAT3.","280":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is associated with breast cancer progression. However, the potential role of ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5) on ERS in breast cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the role of RPL5\/E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) in breast cancer. It was found that RPL5 was downregulated in breast cancer cells and tissues. Additionally, overexpression of RPL5 inhibited cell proliferation. Moreover, the levels of ERS and autophagy markers were estimated using western blotting. Overexpression of RPL5 induced ERS and suppressed autophagy. Additionally, RPL5 downregulated E2F1, which was overexpressed in breast cancer cells. However, E2F1 knockdown promoted the transcriptional activation of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), suppressed ERS response, and promoted autophagy. Rescue assays indicated that the effects of RPL5 on ERS and autophagy were abolished by E2F1. Taken together, RPL5 inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells by modulating ERS and autophagy via the regulation of E2F1. These findings suggest that RPL5 has a tumor-suppressive effect in breast cancer.","281":"Shikonin(SK) is a natural small molecule naphthoquinone compound, which has anti-cancer activity in various human malignant tumors. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1(PYCR1) is involved in tumorigenesis and regulates various cellular processes, including growth, invasion, migration, and apoptosis. However, the effect of SK and PYCR1 on apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma are unclear. Our goal is to determine the internal molecular mechanism of the interaction between SK and PYCR1 and its role in the occurrence and development of liver cancer. The CCK8 assay, wound healing assay, and transwell assays show that SK and siPYCR1(gene silence PYCR1) inhibited the malignant phenotype of HCC cells, including cell viability, colony formation, migration, and invasion, respectively. The flow cytometry assays and immunofluorescence show that SK and siPYCR1 activated apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. SK induces apoptosis and autophagy in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, HCC cells were transfected with small interference fragment PYCR1 siRNA to construct siPYCR1 and SK single treatment group and co-treatment group to verify the interaction between SK and PYCR1. The Western blot identified that PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signal pathway protein expression was significantly downregulated in HCC cells treated with SK and siPYCR1 together. Collectively, SK may induce apoptosis and autophagy by reducing the expression of PYCR1 and suppressing PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR. Thus, SK may be a promising antineoplastic drug in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SK downregulating PYCR1 might supply a theoretical foundation for the potential therapeutic application in hepatocellular carcinoma.","282":null,"283":null,"284":null,"285":"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus which can result in renal failure and severely affect public health. Several studies have revealed the important role of podocyte injury in DN progression. Although, the involvement of exosomes derived from M2 macrophages has been reported in podocyte injury, the underlying molecular mechanism of M2 macrophage-secreted exosomes has not been fully elucidated. Our study suggests that M2 macrophages mitigate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury of podocytes via exosomes. Moreover, we observed that miR-93-5p expression was markedly upregulated in exosomes from M2 macrophages. Inhibition of miR-93-5p derived from M2 macrophage exosomes resulted in apoptosis of LPS-treated podocytes. Additionally, TLR4 showed the potential to bind to miR-93-5p. Subsequently, we validated that TLR4 is a downstream target of miR-93-5p. Further findings indicated that silencing of TLR4 reversed the renoprotective effects of miR-93-5p-containing M2 macrophage exosomes on LPS-induced podocyte injury. In summary, our study demonstrated that M2 macrophage-secreted exosomes attenuated LPS-induced podocyte apoptosis by regulating the miR-93-5p\/TLR4 axis, which provides a new perspective for the treatment of patients with DN.","286":null,"287":"The detailed function of ARAP1-AS1, the antisense RNA of Arf-GAP with Rho-GAP domain, ANK repeat and PH domain-containing protein 1 (ARAP1), in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has not been clearly elucidated and required further investigation. Our study is committed to exploring the role of ARAP1-AS1 in LUAD. Gene expression in LUAD was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase-chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The influence of ARAP1-AS1 on LUAD cell malignant behaviors was evaluated by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, colony formation assay, Transwell invasion assay and wound healing assay. Subcellular fractionation assay detected the cellular localization of ARAP1-AS1 in LUAD. The protein levels were subjected to western blotting. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase reporter assay were employed to verify the interaction between ARAP1-AS1, ARAP1 and enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2). Our investigation identified that ARAP1-AS1 was upregulated in LUAD cells and tissues. ARAP1-AS1 silencing repressed LUAD cell growth and migration. Furthermore, ARAP1-AS1 knockdown altered the expression of its sense mRNA, ARAP1. ARAP1-AS1 could recruit EZH2 to inhibit ARAP1 expression. Additionally, the downregulation of ARAP1 reversed ARAP1-AS1 downregulation-induced repression of cell growth and migration in LUAD. In conclusion, ARAP1-AS1 recruited EZH2 to silence ARAP1, facilitating cell proliferation, migration and invasion in LUAD. Our study demonstrated the possibility of ARAP1-AS1 to be a novel therapeutic target for LUAD.

RAB26, a member of Rab GTPase superfamily, has been suggested to play a role in the tumorigenesis of NSCLC. The present work aimed to explore whether and how RAB26 contributed to the progression of NSCLC. NSCLC cell line A549 was transfection with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or overexpression (Ov) vector to knockdown RAB26 or overexpress SMAD3, respectively. Then the malignant processes of A549 cells including proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK-8, colony formation, wound-healing, transwell and TUNEL assays, respectively. Expression of proteins involved in these processes was measured by western blot. A549 xenograft mice model was established to confirm the effect of RAB26 silence on NSCLC progression in vivo. The relationship between RAB26 and SMAD3 was analyzed by bioinformatics and then verified by dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We found that silence of RAB26 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted apoptosis of A549 cells. In vivo studies revealed that the tumor growth of A549 xenograft was markedly suppressed upon RAB26 silence. Moreover, it was confirmed that SMAD3 bound to the promoter of RAB26 and enhance its expression. Finally, we observed that overexpression of SMAD3 significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of RAB26 silence on NSCLC progression. Collectively, RAB26 may contribute to the progression of NSCLC after being transcriptionally activated by SMAD3.","289":"This study explored the role and potential molecular mechanism of phillyrin in cerebral ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury. The rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)\/R model was constructed, and cerebral infarction volume, brain water content, and neurological score were measured. Neuron morphological structures in brain tissues and primary neuron apoptosis were detected using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and Hoechst 33258 staining, respectively. In MCAO\/R rats, phillyrin markedly reduced cerebral infarction volume, neurological score, and brain water content and inhibited neuron apoptosis. In vitro experiments showed that phillyrin remarkably increased viability and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release of H2O2-injured neurons. Moreover, phillyrin remarkably downregulated the proportion of apoptosis-related protein B-associated X (Bax)\/B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2) and reduced procaspase-3, phospho-Akt (p-Akt-1), and phosphorylation-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) levels in H2O2-injured neurons. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor ZSTK474 weakened the effects of phillyrin on p-mTOR, p-Akt-1, characteristic proteins of autophagy 3-II (LC3-II) and beclin-1 levels, and H2O2-induced neuronal apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, phillyrin alleviates I\/R injury by inhibiting neuronal cell apoptosis and autophagy pathway, which may provide a new treatment strategy for cerebral I\/R injury.","290":"As a chronic brain disease, epilepsy affects ~50 million people worldwide. The traditional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are widely applied but showing various problems. Although the new AEDs have partially solved the problems of traditional AEDs, the current clinical application of traditional AEDs are not completely replaced by new drugs, particularly due to the large individual differences in drug plasma concentrations and narrow therapeutic windows among patients. Therefore, it is still clinically important to continue to treat patients using traditional AEDs with individualized therapeutic plans. To date, our understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms regulating plasma concentrations of AEDs has advanced rapidly, expanding the knowledge on the effects of genetic polymorphisms of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes on the plasma concentrations of AEDs. It is increasingly imperative to summarize and conceptualize the clinical significance of recent studies on individualized therapeutic regimens. In this review, we extensively summarize the critical effects of genetic polymorphisms of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes on the plasma concentrations of several commonly used AEDs as well as the clinical significance of testing genotypes related to drug metabolism on individualized drug dosage. Our review provides solid experimental evidence and clinical guidance for the therapeutic applications of these AEDs.","291":"Disulfiram (DSF) is an anti-alcoholism medication with superior antitumor activity and clinical safety; its antitumor mechanisms in gastric cancer (GC) have not been fully explored. In the present work, low nontoxic concentrations of copper (Cu) ions substantially enhanced DSF's antitumor activity, inhibiting the proliferation and growth of GC cell lines. DSF\/Cu elevated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis was induced in an ROS-dependent manner. This process might involve primary inhibition GC by DSF\/Cu through induction of apoptosis via the ROS\/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Disordering transportation of ubiquitinated protein may also fuel the process. In summary, we found that DSF exerts antitumor effects on GC. DSF\/Cu should be considered as adjunctive therapy for GC.","292":null,"293":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) showed high cancer-related mortality in recent years partly due to the absence of an effective prognostic predictor.

In this work, we evaluated the LINC01094 level in 122 CRC patients' tissues and in human CRC cell lines. We explored the ability of LINC01094 in overall survival and progression-free survival estimate. The effect of LINC01094 dysregulation on the CRC cells was investigated. LINC01094 is highly expressed in CRC tissues and cells than normal ones. This high expression was correlated with absent vascular invasion, positive lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. With the result of Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox's proportional hazard analysis, LINC01094 was an effective biomarker for CRC overall survival. Downregulation of LINC01094 impeded the malignant biological behavior (proliferation, invasion, and migration) of CRC cells, while overexpression of LINC01094 boosted that maybe by sponging miR-1266-5p. LINC01094 might function as an oncogene in CRC and allowed the discovery of a new biomarker for prognosis and therapy of CRC.","294":null,"295":"MCC950, a specific NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inhibitor, has been reported to play a role in various cardiovascular diseases. However, its role in heart failure (HF)-induced ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) remains unclear. Hence, the present study aimed to clarify the role and underlying mechanisms of MCC950 in HF-induced VAs. Male C57BL\/6 mice were induced with HF via transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Histological analysis, echocardiography, electrophysiological investigation, and western blot analysis were conducted to evaluate VA vulnerability induced by TAC and the potential mechanisms underlying the effects. MCC950 markedly improved cardiac function and decreased pulmonary edema induced by HF. Moreover, MCC950 also decreased VA vulnerability, as shown by the shortened QTc duration and action potential duration 90 (APD90), reduced APD alternans threshold, and decreased VA induction rate. Furthermore, MCC950 treatment significantly reversed TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. In addition, MCC950 administration increased the protein levels of ion channels (Kv4.2, KChIP2, and Cav1.2). Mechanistically, the above changes induced by MCC950 were due to the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. As a specific NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950 significantly decreased HF-induced VA vulnerability by reversing cardiac structural remodeling and electrical remodeling, and the mechanism through which MCC950 exhibited this effect was inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.","296":null,"297":null,"298":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SEMA3B antisense RNA 1 (head to head) (SEMA3B-AS1) is a recently identified tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. However, its role in glioblastoma (GBM) is unclear. This study was conducted to explore the role of SEMA3B-AS1 in GBM. In this study, the expression of SEMA3B-AS1, cyclin D1 and miR-195 were determined by RT-qPCR. Gene interactions were evaluated by dual-luciferase assay and overexpression experiments. BrdU assay was performed to monitor cell proliferation. We observed downregulation of SEMA3B-AS1 in GBM. The expression of SEMA3B-AS1 was inversely correlated with the expression of cyclin D1 but positively correlated with the expression of miR-195. In GBM cells, overexpression of SEMA3B-AS1 and miR-195 caused reduced expression levels of cyclin D1. MiR-195 inhibitor reduced the effects of overexpression of SEMA3B-AS1 on the expression of cyclin D1. Moreover, overexpression of SEMA3B-AS1 increased the expression levels of miR-195. Cell proliferation data showed that, SEMA3B-AS1 and miR-195 decreased cell proliferation, while overexpression of cyclin D1 increased GBM cell proliferation. In addition, miR-195 inhibitor inhibited the role of overexpression of SEMA3B-AS1 in cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, miR-195 interacted with cyclin D1, but not SEMA3B-AS1. Furthermore, SEMA3B-AS1 decreased the methylation of the promoter region of miR-195. Therefore, we concluded that miR-195 links lncRNA SEMA3B-AS1 and cyclin D1 to regulate the proliferation of GBM cells.","299":"MicroRNA (miRNA) is strongly interrelated with the pathogenesis of glioma. However, its potential biological effect and underlying mechanism of miR-3200-3p in human glioma remain elusive. In the current study, we checked the level of miR-3200-3p in different glioma cells. Then, its biological functions on glioma cell proliferation metastasis was investigated using the miR-3200-3p mimic and inhibitor. The direct target of miR-3200-3p was tested in these cells. Results demonstrated that miR-3200-3p is remarkably downregulated in human glioma cells. The relative level of miR-3200-3p is strongly associated with biological features, including proliferation, colony formation, and metastasis. Additionally, Ca2+\/calmodulin dependent kinase 2a (CAMK2A) might be the direct target gene of miR-3200-3p, and CAMK2A overexpression reversed the anticancer roles of miR-3200-3p on glioma cellular function. Importantly, these results further showed that miR-3200-3p downregulated the proliferation and metastasis by suppressing the expression of CAMK2A, thus regulating the Ras\/Raf\/MEK\/ERK pathway.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms and finding new therapeutic targets for ESCC are of crucial importance. PolyC-RNA-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) is an RNA-binding protein. Here, we found overexpressed PCBP1 in esophageal cancer tissues by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting analysis. PCBP1 knockdown significantly attenuated migratory and invasion abilities of ESCC cells. Mechanistically, PCBP1 bound directly to tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) mRNA, which was verified by RNA-protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. PCBP1 knockdown markedly reduced messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of TPM3. After inhibiting intracellular mRNA synthesis with actinomycin D (ActD), it was found that PCBP1 knockdown contributed to a significant decrease in TPM3 mRNA degradation. Furthermore, PCBP1 promoted migration and invasion of EC cells by directly binding to the 3'UTR of TPM3 mRNA, increasing TPM3 mRNA stability. Taken together, PCBP1 acting as a pro-oncogenic factor enhances TPM3 mRNA stability by directly binding to the 3'UTR of TPM3 mRNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings provide a new perspective for understanding the molecular mechanism of esophageal carcinogenesis, and PCBP1 is a promising therapeutic target.","301":"Cisplatin (DDP)-induced chemoresistance is an important reason for the failure of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) participate in the chemoresistance of diverse cancers. However, the function of hsa_circ_0017639 (circ_0017639) in the DDP resistance of NSCLC is unclear. Forty-one NSCLC samples (21 DDP-resistant samples and 20 DDP-sensitive samples) were utilized in the research. The relative expression levels of some genes were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay for half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of DDP and cell viability, colony formation and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU) assays for cell proliferation, flow cytometry assay for cell apoptosis, transwell assay for cell invasion and wound-healing assay for cell migration were performed. The regulation mechanism of circ_0017639 was demonstrated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. We observed higher levels of circ_0017639 in DDP-resistant NSCLC samples and cells. Functionally, circ_0017639 silencing decreased tumor growth and elevated DDP sensitivity in vivo and induced apoptosis, repressed proliferation, invasion, and migration of DDP-resistant NSCLC cells in vitro. Mechanically, circ_0017639 modulated sine oculis homeobox 1 (SIX1) expression via sponging microRNA (miR)-1296-5p. Also, miR-1296-5p inhibitor restored circ_0017639 knockdown-mediated impacts on cell DDP resistance in DDP-resistant NSCLCs. Furthermore, SIX1 overexpression counteracted the inhibiting impact of miR-1296-5p upregulation on DDP resistance and malignant phenotypes of DDP-resistant NSCLC cells. In conclusion, circ_0017639 conferred DDP resistance and promoted tumor growth via elevating SIX1 expression through sequestering miR-1296-5p in NSCLC, providing a new mechanism for understanding the chemoresistance and progression of NSCLC.","302":"Double homeobox A pseudogene 8 (DUXAP8) is a known tumor promoter in several malignancies. Nonetheless, its function in colon cancer (CC) is indefinite. Herein, we explored the significance of DUXAP8 and its underlying mechanism in CC. Our data indicated that DUXAP8 was upregulated in CC, and it was related to advanced stages and lymph node metastases. Based on our Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, elevated DUXAP8 expression resulted in shorter patient overall survival (OS). Conversely, DUXAP8 silencing strongly suppressed cellular proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Based on our western blot analysis, DUXAP8 deficiency strongly inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro. Alternately, DUXAP8 overexpression accelerated cellular proliferation migration and invasion in CC. Finally, silencing DUXAP8 prevented tumorigenesis in a mouse xenograft model in vivo. Collectively, our results demonstrated that DUXAP8 regulates the occurrence and advancement of CC, and may serve as a regulatory hub for this disease.","303":"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a common type of malignancy originating from the epithelium of the pancreatic duct, with the most lethal feature and worst prognosis. LEM domain containing 1 (LEMD1) is overexpressed in multiple tumor tissues and plays a key role in cancer carcinogenesis and progression. However, little is known about the potential of LEMD1 in PC. In this study, we explored the clinical values, as well as the potential roles and mechanisms of LEMD1 in PC. We, for the first time, showed that LEMD1 was upregulated in PC and negatively correlated with the overall and disease-free survival of patients with PC. Of the function, LEMD1 knockdown inhibited cancer cell growth, migration and invasion, while LEMD1 overexpression promoted tumor aggressiveness. The tumor-promoting influences of LEMD1 in PC were also proved by in vivo assays. Mechanistically, GSEA identified that LEMD1 promoted PC aggressiveness, as well as affecting cell cycle dysregulation and apoptosis resistance, by p53 suppression and the activation of the mTORC1 signal pathway. In short, LEMD1 could serve as a valuable prognostic candidate and a potential therapeutic target of PC.Abbreviations: ATCC: American Type Culture Collection; CCK-8: Cell counting kit 8; CDK: Cyclin-dependent kinases; CTA: Cancer-testis antigen; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium; ECL: enhanced chemiluminescence; FBS: Fetal bovine serum; GEO: Gene Expression Omnibus; LEMD1: LEM domain containing 1; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; NC: Negative control; PC: Pancreatic cancer; PVDF: Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes; qRT-PCR: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; SDS-PAGE: Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SD: Standard deviation; SKP2: S-Phase kinase-associated protein 2; TAA: Tumor-associated antigen; TBST: Tris-buffered Saline Tween-20; TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas.","304":null,"305":"Glioma is the most common primary malignant brain tumors in adults. Despite considerable advances in treatment, the clinical outcome remains dismal. Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein, has always been found to be elevated in glioma, which predicts a poor prognosis. However, studies on the regulatory network of TSPO in glioma are limited. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and our research group cohorts demonstrated that TSPO expression was also highly expressed in glioma tissues and glioma cell lines. Inhibition of TSPO expression significantly reduced glioma cell proliferation and mobility in vitro. Suppression of TSPO decreased the expression of MAPK-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPKAPK3) and increased the degradation rate of its mRNA. TSPO directly interacts with ELAV1-like RNA-binding protein 1 (HUR) and promotes the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of HUR. Inhibition of HUR decreased MAPKAPK3 expression and cell proliferation and mobility, whereas overexpression of MAPKAPK3 reversed the effects. Overexpression of HUR in TSPO-knockdown cells enhanced the mRNA stability of MAPKAPK3. Furthermore, rescue experiments show that the HUR\/MAPKAPK3 axis accounts for the TSPO-mediated effects on glioma cell proliferation and mobility. Together, our present study indicated that TSPO may promote the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of HUR, thus increasing the mRNA stability of MAPKAPK3 and promoting the proliferation and mobility of glioma cells. The HUR\/MAPKAPK3 axis may be key targets for blocking the effects of TSPO and may contribute to glioma therapy.","306":"Studies have revealed the relationship between histone deacetylases (HDACs)\/microRNAs (miRNAs) and sepsis, but little has ever investigated the mechanism of HDAC1\/miR-124-5p in sepsis.

Septic mice were induced by cecal ligation and puncture. HDAC1, miR-124-5p and HMGB1 expression in myocardial tissues of septic mice were detected. Septic mice were injected with HDAC1 low expression-, miR-124-5p high expression- or HMGB1 low expression-related structures to observe cardiac function, inflammatory response, oxidative stress response, myocardial pathological changes and apoptosis in myocardial tissues of septic mice. The relationship of HDAC1\/miR-124-5p\/HMGB1 was verified. HDAC1 and HMGB1 expression were upregulated while miR-124-5p expression was decreased in myocardial tissues of septic mice. Restored miR-124-5p\/depleted HDAC1 or HMGB1 recovered the cardiac function, improved cardiac function, inflammatory response, oxidative stress response, myocardial pathological changes and inhibit ed cardiomyocyte apoptosis in septic mice. HDAC1 bound to miR-124-5p which directly targeted HMGB1. This study suggests that down-regulated HDAC1 or up-regulated miR-124-5p recovers myocardial damage of septic mice via decreasing HMGB1.","307":"Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic bone metabolic disease with complicated pathogenesis and is difficult to cure clinically. The regulatory mechanisms of OP are needed to be further investigated. In the present study, we focused on the role of myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT) in OP development and examined the underlying mechanism. The serum expression levels of MIAT in samples from patients with OP and healthy controls were compared using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the relationship between MIAT and its potential target microRNA, i.e., miR-150-5p. Moreover, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured and transfected with MIAT shRNA, with or without miR-150-5p inhibitor. EdU staining and colony formation analysis were performed to determine the proliferation ability of these cells. Furthermore, the TUNEL assay and flow cytometry were used to assess BMSC apoptosis. Finally, RT-PCR and Western blot assays were employed to assess the expression of osteogenic differentiation biomarkers. Compared with controls, the expression of MIAT was significantly increased, whereas that of miR-150-5p was markedly decreased in patients with OP. MIAT and miR-150-5p expression levels exhibited a strong negative correlation. Furthermore, osteogenic differentiation indicators were suppressed in serum of OP patients. MIAT was downregulated, and miR-150-5p was upregulated in induced to osteogenic differentiation BMSCs. Furthermore, downregulation of MIAT dramatically promoted osteogenic differentiation, increased proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in BMSCs; miR-150-5p inhibitor abrogated the effects of MIAT. In conclusion, lncRNA MIAT can regulate the proliferation, apoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.","308":null,"309":null,"310":"Our study mainly reports the specific mechanisms of microRNA (miR)-874-3p on drug resistance in gastric cancer (GC). Clinical specimen was collected. The upstream long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and the downstream gene of miR-874-3p were predicted using bioinformatic analysis with the results being ascertained with dual-luciferase reporter assay. The viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion of transfected GC cells with or without cisplatin (DDP) treatment were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometric, Scratch, and Transwell assays. An animal xenograft model was constructed. Expressions of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00922 (LINC00922), miR-874-3p and potential target genes were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase-chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. MiR-874-3p, which was lower-expressed in drug-resistant GC tissues and cells, was upregulated to repress the viability, migration and invasion but enhance the apoptosis and sensitivity in GC cells with or without DDP resistance. Downregulation of miR-874-3p eliminated the effects of silenced LINC00922, a upstream lncRNA of miR-874-3p, on cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion, as well as the expressions of Glycerophosphodiester Phosphodiesterase Domain Containing 5 (GDPD5) and the downstream gene of miR-874-3p in DDP-resistant GC cells. GDPD5 silencing diminished the effects of miR-874-3p downregulation on GDPD5 expression, viability, migration and invasion of DDP-resistant GC cells. Additionally, LINC00922 silencing enhanced the inhibitory effect of DDP on tumor growth, whereas reversing the effects of DDP on LINC00922, miR-874-3p and GDPD5 expressions in tumors. MiR-874-3p, an miRNA, which is sponged by LINC00922 and targets GDPD5, inhibits the GC progression yet enhances the DDP sensitivity in GC.","311":null,"312":null,"313":null,"314":"As a staple chemotherapy medicine, cisplatin (DDP) is extensively applied in cancer patients, but its drug resistance is limited. Numerous studies have elucidated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) performs as a pivotal agent in osteosarcoma (OS). Nevertheless, lncRNA long intergenic non-coding 00641 (LINC00641)'s functions in DDP resistance for OS remain obscure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of LINC00641 on drug resistance of OS. The tissues of both clinical cancer patients and the normal control were gathered. Detection of LINC00641, microRNA-320d (miR-320d) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) was conducted. After the selection of OS cell lines, the detection of cell advancement was applied. Series of experiments were conducted to verify the interaction of LINC00641, miR-320d and MCL1. Xenografted tumor model in vivo was utilized to determine the function of LINC00641. The data displayed, LINC00641 was prominently elevated in OS tissues and cells, especially in DDP-resistant tumors and cell lines. Knock-down LINC00641 was able to attenuate progression of DDP-resistant OS cells thus dampening their drug resistance toward DDP. Moreover, knock-downing LINC00641 gene was also able to manifest antagonism toward DDP-resistance in vivo. On the grounds of bioinformatics prediction, a direct binding of LINC00641 with miR-320d existed, whose target was MCL1. Meanwhile, LINC00641 modulated MCL1 via targeting miR-320d. Additionally, repressive LINC00641 blocked MCL1 via emulative interaction with miR-320d, thus expediting DDP-sensitivity of OS cells. All in all, it is found that LINC00641 is available to escalate drug resistance of DDP-resistant OS cells via mediation of miR-320d\/MCL1 axis.","315":"Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have been increasingly studied, LINC01426 has not been fully investigated in LUAD. The GEPIA database revealed that LINC01426 was upregulated in LUAD tissues. In our study, we further verified the significantly high expression of LINC01426 in LUAD tissues and cell lines. We also analyzed the LINC01426 expression level and LUAD clinical features and found that high LINC01426 expression was associated with tumor diameter; tumor, node, and metastases (TNM) staging; lymph node metastasis (LNM); and overall survival (OS) rate of LUAD patients. In vitro experiments revealed that suppression of LINC01426 could repress the proliferation, migration and invasion of LUAD cells. Then, the bioinformatic analysis revealed that there were binding domains between miR-125a-5p and the 3'-UTR of LINC01426. As revealed by dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment and RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, miR-125a-5p could bind to LINC01426. Additionally, the results of qRT-PCR and Pearson's analysis respectively revealed that miR-125a-5p was slightly expressed in LUAD and its expression was negatively correlated with LINC01426. Moreover, casein kinase 2 alpha 1 (CSNK2A1) was predicted to bind to miR-125a-5p. CSNK2A1 expression was remarkably high in LUAD tissues, negatively associated with miR-125a-5p, and positively correlated with LINC01426. Subsequently, our results showed that CSNK2A1 enhanced the malignant progression of LUAD cells.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a variety of epigenetic regulatory processes. The tumorigenesis and development of most cancers cannot be studied separately from their regulation by lncRNAs. To explore the epigenetic regulation of PD-L1, we identified an lncRNA, LINC00244, which reduced PD-L1 expression and predicted good clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LINC00244 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of HCC by downregulating PD-L1 expression. In addition, low LINC00244 expression activated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways and facilitated the rapid growth and metastasis of HCC cells. Thus, LINC00244 is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.","319":"Thyroid cancer (THCA) is the most common cancer of the endocrine system across the globe. To date, the mechanism of development of THCA remains scarcely known. In this study, we aim to elucidate the long non-coding RNA CATIP antisense RNA 1 (lncRNA CATIP-AS1\/CATIP-AS1) role in the pathogenesis of THCA and its regulatory mechanism. The result shows that the CATIP-AS1 was significantly downregulated in THCA tissues and cells and was associated with a poor prognosis of patients diagnosed with THCA. The overexpression of CATIP-AS1 significantly inhibited THCA cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) but increased the THCA cell apoptosis. We found that CATIP-AS1 endogenously sponges miR-515-5p and its overexpression could inhibit miR-515-5p regulatory effect. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-515-5p repressed the Smad4 expression level, consequently reversed the inhibiting effect of overexpressed CATIP-AS1 on the proliferation, and migration of THCA cell. It also reversed the increased THCA cell apoptosis and the downregulated-CATIP-AS1-induced cell EMT inhibition. Summarily, we demonstrated that the CATIP-AS1 promotes the progression and metastasis of THCA via EMT pathway partly through regulating the miR-515-5p and Smad4 expression in THCA cell. The CATIP-AS1 could be a promising biomarker for early THCA detection and prognosis and a possible therapeutic target for its treatment.","320":"Osteosarcoma is a common bone malignancy in children and adolescents. Chemotherapeutic drug resistance is the major factor impacting the surgical outcome and prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma. This investigation assessed the role and mechanism of circular RNA_ANKIB1 in the development of osteosarcoma. The circular RNA (circ) _ANKIB1, microRNA (miR)-26b-5p, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) expression in OS samples was investigated through RT-qPCR. The EZH2, multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), P-gp, and lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) protein expressions were analyzed through western blot. The association between circ_ANKIB1 and the occurrence of clinic-pathological features in OS patients was assessed; the circular features of circ_ANKIB1 were analyzed. The hFOB1.19, KHOS, U2-OS OS cells were used to study the semi-inhibitory concentration IC50 of Doxorubicin (DXR)-resistant cells, clone formation, invasion, and apoptosis. The luciferase assay was used to study the binding of circ-ANKIB1 with miR-26b-5p and the targeting of miR-26b-5p with EZH2. In vivo experiments were performed via subcutaneous tumorigenic experiments. MiR-26b-5p in OS tissues and cells and DXR-resistant OS tissues and cells was silenced while circ_ANKIB1 and EZH2 were elevated. Circ_ANKIB1 silencing elevated miR-26b-5p, repressed EZH2, MRP1, P-gp, LRP, IC50, and elevated OS advancement. Circ_ANKIB1 bind miR-26b-5p. Reduced miR-26b-5p revered the influence of silencing circ_ANKIB1 on DXR resistant OS cells. MiR-26b-5p targeted EZH2, and EZH2 elevation reversed the impact of increasing miR-26b-5p on DXR resistant cells. Circ_ANKIB1 silencing suppressed DXR-resistant OS cells in vivo. In conclusion, Circ_ANKIB1 binds miR-26b-5p and modulates EZH2 to accelerate the chemo-resistance of osteosarcoma.","321":"Esophageal cancer is a malignant tumor of the digestive system that is prone to metastasis. Chemokines and their receptors act an essential role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of CXCL12\/CXCR7 in the growth and metastasis of esophageal cancer. CXCR7 was found highly expressed in clinical tissues and cells of esophageal cancer. Knockdown of CXCR7 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of esophageal cancer cells. The knockdown of chemokine CXCL12 also inhibited the expression of EMT-related proteins and the mesenchymal morphology changes of esophageal cancer cells, but the knockdown of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) had no such effect. Furthermore, the knockdown of CXCR7 attenuated the enhanced EMT process induced by CXCL12 overexpression, while the knockdown of CXCR4 cannot inhibit this process. In addition, overexpressed CXCL12\/CXCR7 activated the downstream STAT3 pathway, but had little effect on the extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) or serine-threonine kinase (AKT) pathways. Inhibition of the STAT3 pathway using AZD9150 weakened the accelerated effects of CXCL12\/CXCR7 on the growth and metastasis of esophageal cancer in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our research revealed that CXCL12\/CXCR7 regulates EMT and other malignant processes by activating the STAT3 pathway to accelerate the growth and metastasis of esophageal cancer.","322":"Glioma is the commonest intracranial malignancy, and circRNAs are important regulatory factors which are implicated in the development of glioma. Nonetheless, the role of circRNAs in glioma is largely unknown. The research is performed to elaborate on the biological role of has_circ_0000418 (circ_0000418) in glioma progression and its potential molecular mechanism. The differentially expressed circRNAs in glioblastoma patient derived cells and neural progenitor cells were analyzed based on the microarray data of GSE146463. Additionally, qRT-PCR and Western blot experiments were conducted to measure the expression of circ_0000418, microRNA-409-3p (miR-409-3p) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) in glioma tissues\/cells. Cell growth and cell cycle distribution were monitored using CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay and flow cytometry. Bioinformatics prediction, dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment and RIP assay were conducted to verify the targeting relationship between circ_0000418 and miR-409-3p, miR-409-3p and PDK1 3'UTR. In this work, we observed that, circ_0000418 expression level was significantly up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Circ_0000418 overexpression facilitated glioma cell growth and accelerated cell cycle progression, while knockdown of circ_0000418 produced the opposite effects. Circ_0000418 specifically combined with miR-409-3p, and circ_0000418 negatively modulated the expression of miR-409-3p. PDK1 acted as a target gene of miR-409-3p, and PDK1 could be positively and indirectly modulated by circ_0000418 in glioma cells. In summary, circ_0000418 enhances glioma cell growth and accelerates cell cycle progression by regulating miR-409-3p\/PDK1 axis.","323":null,"324":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in the development and progression of various diseases.

We detected the relative expression level of circ-CCDC66 in PTC specimens and cell lines using real-time reverse transcription PCR. In addition, EdU assay, transwell assay, and xenograft analysis were performed to measure the effect of circ-CCDC66 on the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities of PTC cells. We also investigated the potential mechanism of circ-CCDC66 by bioinformatics analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. We observed that circ-CCDC66 expression was upregulated in PTC specimens and cell lines and was correlated with poor clinical characteristics of PTC patients. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated that knockdown of circ-CCDC66 markedly suppressed the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities of PTC cells. Mechanistically, miR-129-5p was a target gene of circ-CCDC66 and was downregulated in PTC tissues. LARP1, a downstream target of miR-129-5p, was upregulated in PTC tissues. In addition, we confirmed that inhibition of circ-CCDC66 could repress xenograft tumor growth. Circ-CCDC66 promoted PTC proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth by sponging miR-129-5p and promoting LARP1 expression.","325":null,"326":"Cervical cancer is the most common malignant tumor in gynecology with high mortality rate, so novel approaches for cervical cancer treatment are urgently needed. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression data and clinicopathological data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) downloaded from University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Xena database. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) was screened out as a key prognostic gene for cervical cancer. Revealed by the results of ELISA and Western blot, the expression of CXCL1 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) in cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and C33A) was significantly higher than that in the primary cervical epithelial cells. Cellular immunofluorescence was used in this study to observe CXCR2 localization. Through CCK8, clone formation assay, wound healing assay and Annexin V\/PI staining, it was found that down-regulation of CXCL1 expression or treatment with CXCR2 antagonist (SB 225002) could reduce the cell viability, affect the proliferation, weaken the migration ability, and promote the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells; however, the effect of CXCR2 antagonist was improved after over-expressed CXCL1. CXCL1\/CXCR2 chemokine system regulates the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of cervical cancer cells in the form of an autocrine loop, thus affecting the development of cervical cancer.

Our investigation showed that circUBAP2 was significantly upregulated in DDP-resistant TNBC and TNBC sensitivity to DDP could be enhanced by silencing of circUBAP2. Moreover, circUBAP2 was revealed to be a ceRNA for miR-300 to upregulate the expression of anti-silencing function 1B histone chaperone (ASF1B). The effect of circUBAP2\/miR-300\/ASF1B axis on DDP resistance of TNBC was evaluated by rescue experiments, which demonstrated that circUBAP2 inhibited TNBC sensitivity to DDP through miR-300\/ASF1B axis. Furthermore, it was discovered that ASF1B activated PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling to facilitate the DDP resistance of TNBC cells.

This study found that circular RNA circ SET domain containing 2 (circSETD2) is abnormally expressed in liver cancer tissues, but the role and molecular mechanismsin the occurrence and development of liver cancer are still unclear. The expression level of circSETD2 was evaluated through Quantitative Real-time Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in cancerous liver tissues (30 cases), liver cancer cell lines and para-cancerous tissues. Knockdown and overexpression circSETD2 lentiviral vector was constructed and applied to transfect hepatoma cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation assay, flow cytometry and Transwell assay were used to examine the effects of circSETD2 overexpression or knockdown on liver cancer migration, invasion, cell cycle and cell proliferation. The tumourigenicity in vivo was utilized to assess the effect of circSETD2 on the proliferation of liver cancer cells. circSETD2 expression is lower in cell lines and liver cancer tissues. circSETD2 knockdown can considerably increase liver cancer cells' invasion, proliferation and colony formation. While In vitro and in vivo, circSETD2 overexpression shows opposite effect. Western blot showed that circSETD2 knockdown can considerably promote E-cadherin expression and inhibit Vimentin, N-cadherin, matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2 expression.

A PE mouse model was established, followed by detection of parameters such as blood pressure, proteinuria, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein, observation of alterations of mouse placenta and kidney, and detection of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia\/lymphoma-2, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and SNHG5 expression patterns. The expressions of LC3, Beclin-1, and p62 in the placenta of PE mice were detected. Moreover, the SNHG5 expression was downregulated in the established HTR-8\/SVneo trophoblast model, followed by evaluation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy. After combination treatment with 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor) and si-SNHG5, the behaviors of HTR-8\/SVneo cells were observed. The binding relations between SNHG5 and miR-31-5p, and miR-31-5p and SPARC were verified. The expressions of miR-31-5p and SPARC in the placenta of mice and trophoblasts were determined.

The bone mineral density (BMD), tissue mineral density (TMD) and bone volume fraction (BV\/TV) were higher, while the stiffness and the ultimate load strength of the tendon interface were enhanced under treatment with exosomes of PASP-PLGA microcapsules. Histochemical staining showed that exosomes of PASP-PLGA microcapsules promoted tendon and bone interface healing after rotator cuff injury. The tendon regeneration- and cartilage differentiation-related protein expressions were significantly upregulated under treatment with exosomes of PASP-PLGA microcapsules. In conclusion, exosome-delivered BMP-2 and PLA promoted tendon bone healing in rotator cuff tear via Smad\/RUNX2 pathway. Our findings may provide a new insight for promoting tendon healing.","347":"Animal manure is the main source of bioenergy production by anaerobic digestion (AD). However, the pathogenic bacteria in manure may pose a high risk to human health by contaminating the environment if not effectively inactivated during AD. Worldwide, more than 20,000 biogas plants are running for the treatment of animal manure. AD has been playing the important role in establishing a circular economy in the agricultural sector and may contribute to the United Nations sustainable development goal (UN SDG). Nevertheless, whether AD is a reliable approach for pathogens inactivation has been challenged. A comprehensive understanding of the coping mechanisms of pathogens with adverse conditions and the challenges of establishing the AD process to inactivate effectively pathogens are yet to be analyzed. In this review, the diversity and resistance of pathogens in animal manure are summarized. The efficiencies and the difficulties of their inactivations in AD are also analyzed. In particular, three forms of pathogens i.e. sporing-forming pathogens, viable but non-culturable (VBNC) pathogens, and persistent pathogens are discussed. The factors influencing the pathogens' inactivation and AD efficiencies are analyzed. The trade-off between energy production and pathogens inactivation in an AD system was consequently pointed out. This review concluded that the development of anaerobic processes should meet the goals of high efficient bioenergy production and deep hygienization.","348":"LINC00472 is reported to play a role in suppressing tumors in cancers such as lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, among others. We made investigations into the effects of LINC00472 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) progression to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. By qRT-PCR, we assessed the LINC00472 expression in OSCC tissues and cells and performed functional analysis to investigate how LINC00472\/miR-455-3p\/ELF3 impacts OSCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. The role that LINC00472 plays in OSCC tumor growth was examined by establishing a xenograft model. Down-regulation of LINC00472 occurred in tissues and cells of an OSCC tumor. LINC00472 overexpression caused OSCC cell proliferation to be inhibited, cell apoptosis to be promoted, and cell cycle arrest to be induced. As a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), LINC00472 can block miR-455-3p function and further promote ELF3 expression. The overexpression of miR-455-3p or ELF3 knockdown was shown to be capable of reversing the anti-tumor effects of LINC00472 in OSCC. In vivo experiments confirmed the tumor-suppressing role of LINC00472 in the progression of OSCC. In short, we found that the novel LINC00472 inhibits OSCC growth via the miR-455-3p\/ELF3 axis. LINC00472 and its targeted miR-455-3p\/ELF3 axis may represent valuable targets for treating OSCC.","349":"This study aims to determine the effect of exogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) under high glucose (HG)-induced injury in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and to explore the possible underlying mechanisms. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by density-gradient centrifugation and identified as late EPCs by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. EPCs were treated with high concentrations of glucose, H2S, Baf-A1, 3-MA or rapamycin. Cell proliferation, cell migration and tube formation were measured using cell counting kit-8, Transwell migration and tube formation assays, respectively. Cellular autophagy flux was detected by RFP-GFP-LC3, and Western blotting was used to examine the protein expression levels of LC3B, P62, and phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) at Thr495 (p-eNOSThr495). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using a DHE probe. H2S and rapamycin significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of HG on the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of EPCs. Moreover, H2S and rapamycin led to an increase in the number of autophagosomes accompanied by a failure in lysosomal turnover of LC3-II or p62 and p-eNOSThr495 expression and ROS production under the HG condition. However, Baf-A1 and 3-MA reversed the effects of H2S on cell behavior. Collectively, exogenous H2S ameliorated HG-induced EPC dysfunction by promoting autophagic flux and decreasing ROS production by phosphorylating eNOSThr495.","350":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are closely associated with cancer development in glioblastoma (GBM), and this study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms of a novel circular RNA circZNF652 in regulating GBM aggressiveness. The present study found that CircZNF652 and SERPINE1 were upregulated, while miR-486-5p was downregulated in GBM tissues and cell lines, and GBM patients with high expression of CircZNF652 and SERPINE1, and patients with low expression of miR-486-5p tended to have a worse prognosis. Further results validated that both silencing of circZNF652 and miR-486-5p overexpression suppressed cell growth, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis in GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. Next, the underlying mechanisms were investigated, and we found that circZNF652 sponged miR-486-5p to upregulate SERPINE1 in GBM cells. Also, we validated that knock-down of circZNF652 regulated the miR-486-5p\/SERPINE1 axis to reverse the malignant phenotypes in GBM cells. Interestingly, we noticed that GBM cells derived exosomes were characterized by high-expressed CircZNF652.

Here, the qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of has_circ_0008583. The CCK-8 kit was performed to measure cell proliferation. The cell migration and invasion were evaluated by Transwell. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the target combination between the genes in has_circ_0008583\/miR-1301-3p\/METTL3 axis. The in vivo role of has_circ_0008583 was verified by murine xenograft assay. Our data showed that hsa_circ_0008583 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Hsa_circ_0008583 overexpression promoted Hep3B cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but hsa_circ_0008583 silencing had an opposing influence. MiR-1301-3p is directly bound to hsa_circ_0008583 and METTL3. MiR-1301-3p overexpression or METTL3 knockdown could partially counteract hsa_circ_0008583 overexpression-mediated influence on HCC cell behaviors.

Here, we aimed to investigate the potential role of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in CC. Gene expression was determined via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cellular functions were detected using colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and Transwell assays. The interactions among METTL3, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3), and apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer 1 (ACIN1) were confirmed using the MeRIP and RIP assays. An in vivo assay was performed to verify the role of METTL3 in CC development. METTL3 is overexpressed in CC, and therefore, its knockdown inhibits the proliferation and migration of CC cells. Silencing METTL3 inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, a positive association was observed between METTL3 and ACIN1. METTL3 interacts with IGF2BP3 to promote the mRNA stability of ACIN1, the overexpression of which induces the aggressiveness of CC cells. METTL3 promotes ACIN1 mRNA stability to accelerate CC progression, implying that METTL3 is a promising biomarker in CC.","356":"Recently, studies have shown that the up-regulation of Non-SMC Condensin I Complex Subunit G (NCAPG) in some tumors can promote tumor progression, and its high expression has a strong correlation with the poor prognosis of patients. However, there are few studies on NCAPG in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Our research is to explore the role of NCAPG in LUAD and try to reveal the possible molecular mechanism. We use public databases and tissue samples from LUAD patients to verify that NCAPG is significantly up-regulated in LUAD, and the high expression of NCAPG is related to the poor prognosis of patients. Subsequently, we found that silencing NCAPG can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of LUAD cells in vitro and the growth of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice in vivo. In order to explore the possible molecular mechanism of NCAPG's function, we found out the genes co-expressed with NCAPG through the cBioportal database, and discovered that these genes were significantly enriched in the cell cycle and other pathways through DAVID analysis, which implies the importance of NCAPG in the cell cycle. Finally, we confirmed by flow cytometry that NCAPG affects the conversion of cell cycle mitosis from G1 to S. Taken together, our research results suggest that NCAPG plays a role in the progress of LUAD. Moreover, NCAPG can be used as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of LUAD, as well as a potential therapeutic target for patients with LUAD.","357":null,"358":"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most malignant tumors. The treatment of advanced NSCLC can be challenging due to drug resistance. The discovery of novel cancer-testis antigens to develop new strategies for advanced metastatic NSCLC is required. AKAP4 is an oncogene discovered in some malignant tumors, and its molecular function of AKAP4 in NSCLC is unknown. This study aimed to explore the potential function of AKAP4 in the development and progression of NSCLC. AKAP-4 was found to be significantly upregulated in both clinical NSCLC tissues and NSCLC cell lines. Cell viability and migration were suppressed, apoptosis was induced, and tube formation was inhibited by the knockdown of AKAP-4, accompanied by the downregulation of VEGF, N-cadherin, EphA2, and MMP-2, and upregulation of c-AMP, PKA, and E-cadherin. In vivo xenograft experiments revealed that tumor growth was inhibited by the knockdown of AKAP4, accompanied by the activation of c-AMP\/PKA signaling and inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition progression.

This study sought to explore the mechanism of microRNA (miR)-193b-3p in rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I\/R) injury. The cerebral I\/R injury models of rats were established using the suture-occluded method. The pathological changes were observed, and oxidative stress (OS) and mitochondrial function indexes in rat brain tissue were examined. The levels of miR-193b-3p and seven in absentia homolog 1 (SIAH1) were detected. miR-193b-3p agomir or antagomir was injected into the lateral ventricle of I\/R rats to overexpress or inhibit miR-193b-3p expression. The targeting relationship between miR-193b-3p and SIAH1 was verified. The effect of SIAH1 overexpression on brain injury in I\/R rats was investigated by injecting the lentivirus vector into the lateral ventricle. The phosphorylation level of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was identified. miR-193b-3p was lowly expressed in I\/R rats. Overexpression of miR-193b-3p alleviated the pathological damage of I\/R rats and limited the OS and mitochondrial damage. miR-193b-3p targeted SIAH1. Overexpression of SIAH1 partially reversed the protection of miR-193b-3p overexpression against cerebral I\/R injury. p-JNK was up-regulated in I\/R rats and overexpression of miR-193b-3p inhibited p-JNK.

Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) accounts for about 90% of all cervical malignancies and the prognosis are unsatisfied. Here we aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of metallothionein-like 5 (MTL5), a novel metallothionein-like protein, in CESC. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry staining showed that MTL5 was upregulated in CESC tissues than nontumorous cervix tissues, which is consistent with the data from TCGA database. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that higher MTL5 can help predict worse prognosis. In addition, Cox hazard regression analysis verified an independent predictive role of MTL5 in CESC. To further investigate the involvement of MTL5 in CESC, we conducted knockdown experiments in two CESC cell lines. As a result, silencing MTL5g significantly inhibited proliferation of CESC cells. Finally, we validated that silencing MTL5 can suppress CESC tumor growth in vivo using the mice subcutaneous xenografts model. Taken together, higher MTL5 indicates worse survival of CESC after surgical resection. Targeting MTL5 represents a potential therapy of CESC by inhibiting tumor growth, which deserves further investigations.","364":"Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) are attractive therapeutic cells for tissue engineering to treat bone defects. However, how the cells can differentiate into bone remains unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that participate in many biological processes, including stem cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the profiles and functions of lncRNAs in the osteogenic differentiation of hUCMSCs. We identified 343 lncRNAs differentially expressed during osteogenic differentiation, of which 115 were upregulated and 228 were downregulated. We further analyzed these lncRNAs using bioinformatic analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. GO and KEGG pathway analysis showed that 'intracellular part' and 'Phosphatidylinositol signaling system' were the most correlated molecular function and pathway, respectively. We selected the top 10 upregulated lncRNAs to construct six competing endogenous RNA networks. We validated the impact of the lncRNA H19 on osteogenic differentiation by overexpressing it in hUCMSCs. Overall, our results pave the way to detailed studies of the molecular mechanisms of hUCMSC osteogenic differentiation, and they provide a new theoretical basis to guide the therapeutic application of hUCMSCs.","365":null,"366":null,"367":null,"368":null,"369":null,"370":"Biliary atresia (BA) is a devastating liver disease in neonates.

Long non-coding RNA-adducin 3 antisense RNA1 (lnc-ADD3-AS1) has been shown to increase susceptibility to BA. However, the role of lnc-ADD3-AS1 in liver fibrosis in BA remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of lnc-ADD3-AS1 in the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of the immortalized human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line, LX-2. We successfully overexpressed and silenced lnc-ADD3-AS1 in LX-2 cells using adenovirus vectors and evaluated the proliferation of transfected cells using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay. Cell apoptosis was detected using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\/propidium iodide (PI) double staining and flow cytometry. We then analyzed cell migration by performing wound-scratch and transwell migration assays. Our results show that lnc-ADD3-AS1 significantly promoted LX-2 cell proliferation and attenuated apoptosis. More importantly, lncRNA-ADD3-AS1 significantly accelerated the migration of LX-2 cells.

A total of 178 putative targets of 6-methoxyflavone were obtained from the PharmMapper database. Microarray analyses, transcriptome sequencing analyses, functional enrichment analyses, and gene set enrichment analyses were performed to preliminarily explore the roles and mechanisms of the 178 targets in cervical cancer. Cell counting kit-8, cell cycle assays, polymerase chain reactions, and western blotting were used to clarify the mechanism of action of 6-methoxyflavone. Molecular docking and noncovalent interaction analyses were performed to further confirm the mechanism of action in three-dimensional structures. Functional enrichment analyses and gene set enrichment analyses indicated that high mRNA expression of cyclin A2 (CCNA2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) stimulated cell cycle progression in cervical cancer. Cell proliferation and cycle assays, transcriptome sequencing, polymerase chain reactions, and western blotting revealed that 6-methoxyflavone inhibited HeLa cell proliferation and induced S-phase arrest via the CCNA2\/CDK2\/ cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21CIP1) pathway. Molecular docking and noncovalent interaction analyses showed that 6-methoxyflavone had the strongest affinity toward, inhibitory effect on, and noncovalent interactions with CDK2, and that the combination of CDK2 and CCNA2 enhanced these effects.

We tried to study the intervention effect of SIL on NAFLD, and explore the potential mechanisms and targets of SIL on NAFLD improvement. Thirty-three male C57BL6\/J mice were divided into three groups, and, respectively, fed a normal diet (ND), a high-fat diet (HFD) or a HFD given SIL treatment (HFD+SIL). Biochemical indexes and histopathological changes of mice in each group were detected. In addition, quantitative proteomics analysis based on tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) and bioinformatics analysis was performed on protein changes in the livers. SIL could reduce the weight of mice, reduce liver lipid deposition, and improve glucose metabolism. Through comparison among the three experimental groups, a total of 30 overlapping proteins were found. These identified proteins were closely linked to liver lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Moreover, some drug targets were found, namely perilipin-2, phosphatidate phosphatase LPIN1, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and glutathione S-transferase A1. In conclusions, high-fat diet increases the expressions of proteins implicated in lipid synthesis and transport in the liver, which can result in disorders of liver lipid metabolism. SIL can decrease liver lipid deposition and increase insulin sensitivity by regulating the expressions of these proteins. It not only improves the disorder of lipid metabolism in vivo, but also improves the disorder of glucose metabolism.","375":"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is characterized by inflammation of the sacroiliac joint and the attachment point of the spine. Herein, we aimed to investigate the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived exosomes on apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and explored its molecular mechanism. Exosomes were isolated from BMSCs and verified by transmission electron microscope and nanoparticle tracking analysis. FLSs were isolated and co-incubated with BMSC exosomes. Cell apoptosis was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling analysis and flow cytometry. The results showed that BMSC exosomes increased apoptosis of FLSs. MiR-5189-3p was downregulated, while basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like 2 (BATF2) was upregulated in FLSs by treatment of BMSC exosomes. As a direct target of miR-5189-3p, BATF2 inactivates the JAK2\/STAT3 pathway. MiR-5189-3p suppressed apoptosis of FLSs and BATF2 exerted an opposite effect.

Clinically, pancreatic head cancer usually presents with obstructive jaundice and increased serum bile acid levels, suggesting that pancreatic cancer is intricately correlated with a high bile acid environment in the human body. An increasing body of evidence suggests that bile acids are toxic to normal human and colon cancer cells. Nonetheless, the effect of bile acids on the occurrence and development of pancreatic cancer remains a matter of debate. In the present study, to explore the direct effects of high serum concentrations of bile acids on pancreatic cancer and the possible related mechanisms, human pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) cells were subject to different concentrations of bile acid mixtures to assess cell viability and the migration and invasion ability.

However, severe oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity has been well documented. Memantine is a drug for the management of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) due to its promising neuroprotective properties. We hypothesize that Memantine possesses a beneficial role against chemotherapy-induced neuronal damages. In this study, we established an oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity assay model in human SHSY-5Y neuronal cells and investigated the protective effect of Memantine. We showed that Memantine treatment ameliorated oxaliplatin-elevated intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid product malondialdehyde (MDA), and NOX-2 expression. Memantine alleviated impairment of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production by oxaliplatin. As a result, Memantine showed a protective role against oxaliplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis assay revealed that Memantine protected oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis through mitigating the ratio of Bax\/Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 cleavage. We concluded Memantine ameliorated the neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin in a mitochondrial-dependent pathway.","390":"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act crucial roles in the progression of vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis.

The expression of DANCR in the serum samples of all study participants was quantified using RT-qPCR. Then, the predictive capacities of DANCR for the detection of atherosclerosis patients were evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The effects of DANCR on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation and migration were then explored using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell migration assays. The DANCR exhibited increased expression trends in patients with atherosclerosis than healthy controls. Moreover, there were differences in the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), homocysteine (Hcy), and C-reactive protein (CRP) between the healthy controls and atherosclerosis patients. The DANCR expression was positively correlated with serum LDL-C, Hcy, and CRP levels. DANCR expression could distinguish patients with atherosclerosis from healthy individuals with a high area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Additionally, knockdown of DANCR weakened the proliferative abilities and migration capacities of VSMCs. It was also shown that DANCR could compete with miR-335-5p binding.

We predicted that miR-3940-5p could bind to F-circEA-2a and speculated that miR-3940-5p may interact with F-circEA-2a to participate in cancer biology. This study was conducted to explore the interaction between F-circEA-2a and miR-3940-5p in GA. F-circEA-2a and miR-3940-5p (mature and premature) levels in GA were detected using RT-qPCR. Their correlations were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient. The role of F-circEA-2a in miR-3940-5p maturation was analyzed using overexpression assay. The direct binding of premature miR-3940-5p to F-circEA-2a was analyzed by RNA-RNA pulldown. Proliferation was analyzed with BrdU assay. We found that F-circEA-2a and premature miR-3940-5p were overexpressed in GA, while mature miR-3940-5p was under-expressed in GA. F-circEA-2a suppressed miR-3940-5p maturation in GA cells. MiR-3940-5p directly bound to F-circEA-2a wild type (-wt), but not mutant (-mut). F-circEA-2a promoted GA cell proliferation and inhibited the role of miR-3940-5p in reducing cell proliferation. Therefore, F-circEA-2a might suppress mature miR-3940-5p formation by sponging premature miR-3940-5p to promote cell proliferation in GA. Our study characterized a novel circRNA regulating miR-3940-5p maturation in GA.","392":"Mitochondrial fission depends on dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) guanosine triphosphatase activity. Although there is some association between Drp1 and gastric cancer, the detailed mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, the elevation of Drp1 was observed in human gastric carcinoma specimens including gastric mixed adenocarcinoma tissues, gastric intestinal-type adenocarcinoma tissues, and human gastric cancer cells compared to normal control, but not in diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma tissues. Gastric cancer patients with high Drp1 harbored advanced pathological stages and poor progression-free survival probability compared to those with low Drp1. Mdivi-1-mediated inactivation of Drp1 robustly inhibited cell viability and tumor growth but conversely induced cell apoptotic events in vitro and in vivo. Based on the Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes Starbase, L22 ribosomal protein (RPL22) was recognized as the potential downstream oncogene of Drp1. Clinically, the significant correlation of Drp1 and RPL22 was also verified. Mechanistically, Drp1 inactivation did not affect the accumulation of RPL22 in gastric carcinoma. However, the intracellular distribution of RPL22 had an endonuclear location in Drp1-inactivated tumors. Of note, Drp1 inactivation notably reduced the expression of cytoplasmic RPL22 and increased its nuclear level in gastric cancer cells. Collectively, Drp1 had high levels in human gastric carcinoma specimens and could serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in gastric carcinoma. The Drp1 inactivation-mediated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptosis effects on gastric cancer were possibly associated with nuclear import of RPL22. This knowledge may provide new therapeutic tools for treating gastric carcinoma via targeting mitochondria-related ribosome pathway.","393":"In recent years, the problem of cancer resistance has become more and more prominent, seriously affecting treatment efficiency. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role in cell progression and cancer mechanisms. However, there is a lack of systematic studies on its function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistance. CircPTK2, microRNA-942 (miR-942), and Tripartite motif 16 (TRIM16) levels were detected by Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), glucose consumption, and lactate production were assessed using the Seahorse XF96 Glycolysis Analyzer, glucose, and lactate assay kits, respectively. The protein expression was measured with the western bolt Transwell assay was used to determine migration and invasion of transfected cells. (4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry were applied to carry out cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. The relationship among circPTK2, miR-942, and TRIM16 were determined by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay. circPTK2 (hsa_circ_0008305) and TRIM16 were low expressed, while miR-942 was significantly highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, overexpression of circPTK2 remarkably inhibited cell growth, metastasis, and glycolysis in A549\/CDDP and H1299\/CDDP cells. Promotion of miR-942 or inhibition of TRIM16 could reverse the effects of high circPTK2 expression on cell growth, metastasis, and glycolysis in A549\/CDDP and H1299\/CDDP cells. CircPTK2 overexpression inhibited the growth of A549\/CDDP cells in vivo. Furthermore, circPTK2 weakened CDDP resistance of NSCLC through modulating miR-942\/TRIM16 axis, providing a novel sight for the treatment of NSCLC and improving the understanding of the CDDP resistance mechanism of NSCLC.","394":"This study explored the function and mechanisms of HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) in the drug resistance of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Quantitative PCR, Western blotting, MTT assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assay, and luciferase assay were performed. HOTAIR expression levels were upregulated in cisplatin (DDP)-resistant NPC tissues and cells. Knockdown of HOTAIR in DDP-resistant NPC cells increased cell sensitivity of DDP, as well as decreased cell viability, expression of chemoresistance-related proteins, migration and invasion, increased cell apoptosis. In addition, downregulation of microRNA 106a-5p (miR-106a-5p) expression and upregulation of SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) expression were observed in DDP-resistant NPC tissues and cells. MiR-106a-5p targets HOTAIR and SOX4; thus, silencing of HOTAIR significantly increased miR-106a-5p expression. The overexpression of miR-106a-5p significantly reversed the increase in SOX4 expression induced by HOTAIR lentivirus (Lv-HOTAIR). Knockdown of SOX4 reduced the drug resistance of DDP caused by the silencing of miR-106a-5p expression. In summary, HOTAIR enhanced DDP resistance in NPC cells by regulating the miR-106a-5p\/SOX4 axis.","395":"Biofilm formation on biotic or abiotic surfaces is caused by microbial cells of a single or heterogeneous species. Biofilm protects microbes from stressful environmental conditions, toxic action of chemicals, and antimicrobial substances. Quorum sensing (QS) is the generation of autoinducers (AIs) by bacteria in a biofilm to communicate with one other. QS is responsible for the growth of biofilm, synthesis of exopolysaccharides (EPS), and bioremediation of environmental pollutants. EPS is used for wastewater treatment due to its three-dimensional matrix which is composed of proteins, polysaccharides, humic-like substances, and nucleic acids. Autoinducers mediate significantly the degradation of environmental pollutants. Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) producing bacteria as well as quorum quenching enzyme or bacteria can effectively improve the performance of wastewater treatment. Biofilms-based reactors due to their economic and ecofriendly nature are used for the treatment of industrial wastewaters. Electrodes coated with electro-active biofilm (EAB) which are obtained from sewage sludge, activated sludge, or industrial and domestic effluents are getting popularity in bioremediation. Microbial fuel cells are involved in wastewater treatment and production of energy from wastewater. Synthetic biological systems such as genome editing by CRISPR-Cas can be used for the advanced bioremediation process through modification of metabolic pathways in quorum sensing within microbial communities. This narrative review discusses the impacts of QS regulatory approaches on biofilm formation, extracellular polymeric substance synthesis, and role of microbial community in bioremediation of pollutants from industrial effluents.","396":"This study was conducted to investigate the impact of microRNA (miR)-200b-3p on viability, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer (GC) cells and its mechanism. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to measure miR-200b-3p expression in GC tissues and cells; besides, the relationship between miR-200b-3p expression and overall survival time (OS) was analyzed with OncomiR database; cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation assay, flow cytometry, scratch healing assay, and Transwell assay were performed to detect the proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion of GC cells; a lung metastasis model in nude mice was used to examine the effect of miR-200b-3p on the metastasis of GC cells in vivo; the interplay between miR-200b-3p and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) mRNA 3' UTR was predicted by bioinformatics and verified with a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay; besides, the expression of CXCL12 and CXC chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) was probed by Western blot. It was found that miR-200b-3p expression was down-regulated in GC tissues, which was remarkably associated with the lymph node metastasis and decrease of differentiation of GC; transfection with miR-200b-3p mimics restrained the growth, migration, and invasion of GC cells in vitro, induced cell cycle arrest, and inhibited CXCL12 and CXCR7 expression levels; transfection of miR-200b-3p inhibitors worked oppositely in vitro and promoted lung metastasis in vivo. CXCL12 was confirmed as the downstream target of miR-200b-3p and was negatively modulated by miR-200b-3p. In conclusion, miR-200b-3p inhibited GC progression via regulating CXCL12\/CXCR7 axis.","397":"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is associated with inflammation. Platycodin D (PD) demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity. However, whether PD affects DN remains to be explored. Here, we aimed to discuss the role of PD in DN and its underlying mechanisms. High glucose (HG)-induced HK-2 cells were treated with PD, and cell viability was assessed using the Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay. Ferroptosis-related factors such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), iron (Fe2+) level, GSH level, and malondialdehyde (MDA) level were evaluated. Cell death was evaluated using the TUNEL assay. GPX4 expression was evaluated using Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis. The results indicated that HG increased LDH activity, lipid ROS production, Fe2+ levels, and MDA levels and decreased GSH levels, suggesting that the HG condition induced ferroptosis. PD treatment inhibited ferroptosis in HG-induced cells, downregulated ACSL4 and TFR1 expression, and upregulated FTH-1 and SLC7A11 expression. PD reversed the effects of HG condition on cell death. Moreover, GPX4 expression was downregulated in HG-stimulated cells. Furthermore, we substantiated that PD suppressed ferroptosis by modulating GPX4 expression. In conclusion, PD inhibited ferroptosis in HG-induced HK-2 cells by upregulating GPX4 expression, suggesting that PD may be an effective drug for the clinical treatment of DN.","398":"Tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21) has been reported to have a cancer-promoting or anticancer effect in various tumors; however, its role in ovarian cancer (OC) remains to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the biological function of TRIM21 in OC progression and investigated the potential mechanisms. We found that TRIM21 was remarkably decreased in OC tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent-cancerous tissues and normal ovarian epithelium cell. Decreased expression of TRIM21 in OC patients was significantly correlated with shorter overall and disease-specific survival by The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) analysis. Functional assays revealed that TRIM21 inhibited the migration and invasion of OC cells; and that TRIM21 also obviously impaired cell proliferation by inhibiting cell cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that TRIM21 may be a promising biomarker and target for OC diagnosis and treatment.","399":"Osteomyelitis (OM) is an orthopedic disease caused by bone infections in the bone cortex, bone marrow, periosteum, and surrounding soft tissues. Recent studies have implicated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the development of OM. However, little is known about the role of ncRNAs in the osteogenic differentiation during bone infection. In the present study, we investigated the role of KCNQ1OT1\/miR-29b-3p axis in osteogenic differentiation in staphylococcus aureus (SpA)-infected human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). We first examined the expression of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 and miR-29b-3p in the serum samples of OM patients and healthy controls. We also infected hBMSCs with different concentrations of SpA and studied the osteogenic differentiation after infection. Our results revealed that KCNQ1OT1 was downregulated while miR-29b-3p was upregulated in the serum samples of OM patients, as well as in SpA-infected hBMSCs. Overexpression of KCNQ1OT1 ameliorated the damage in hBMSCs caused by SpA infection. KCNQ1OT1 could support hBMSCs osteogenic differentiation by enhancing ALP activity, alizarin red S accumulation, expressions of osteogenic markers, and attenuating inflammatory responses after SpA infection. We further showed that miR-29b-3p was a downstream target of KCNQ1OT1, mediating the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs during SpA infection. Our data suggest that KCNQ1OT1 could ameliorate the SpA-induced suppression of osteogenic differentiation in hBMSCs by sponging miR-29b-3p. Modulating KCNQ1OT1 expression may serve as a strategy to ameliorate osteomyelitis.","400":"Numerous studies have clarified the involvement of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in modulating malignant behavior of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while the concrete mechanism is not completely elucidated. The aim of the study was to figure out the latent functions and molecular mechanisms of circRNA Eps15-homology domain containing protein 2 (EHD2) on NSCLC proliferation, glycolysis and autophagy. The results clarified in NSCLC elevated expression of circEHD2 and declined expression of microRNA (miR)-3186-3p. Repressive circEHD2 or enhancive miR-3186-3p facilitated cell apoptosis rate and autophagy substrates LC3BII and Beclin-1, but curbed the colony-formation and DNA replication ability of NSCLC, glucose consumption, lactic acid production, glycolytic rate-limiting enzyme HK-2 and glutamine hydrolase GLS1 and P62, while overexpressed circEHD2 was adverse. Meanwhile, the impacts of repressive and elevated circEHD2 on NSCLC were turned around via reduced miR-3186-3p or forkhead box k1 (FOXK1) separately. Mechanically, FOXK1 was augmented via circEHD2's competitive integration of miR-3186-3p. Depressive circEHD2 refrained NSCLC tumor growth, which was accelerated via enhancive one. All in all, circEHD2 accelerates the proliferation and glycolysis of NSCLC, but refrains autophagy and apoptosis via strengthening FOXK1 via the adsorption of miR-3186-3p, which is supposed to be a latent molecular target for NSCLC therapy later.","401":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with covalently closed structures that modulate the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we explored whether circ_0008043 regulated the biological function of HCC cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect circ_0008043, microRNA (miR)-326, and RAB21 levels. Expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin was assessed using qPCR. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, colony formation, and transwell assays. Xenograft tumors were used to evaluate cell growth in vivo. The interaction between miR-326 and circ_0008043 or RAB21 was assessed using dual-luciferase reporter analysis and RNA pull-down analysis. The data illustrated that circ_0008043 and RAB21 were highly expressed, while miR-326 was expressed at less levels in HCC tissues and cells. Interfering with circ_0008043 suppressed cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell growth. Circ_0008043 was confirmed to be an miR-326 sponge that targets RAB21. Rescue experiments showed that inhibiting miR-326 abrogated the effect induced by knockdown of circ_0008043, and overexpressed RAB21 abolished the effect induced by miR-326 overexpression. In summary, silencing of circ_0008043 impeded HCC progression by regulating the miR-326\/RAB21 axis. These data suggest that circ_0008043 may have clinical value in the treatment of HCC.","402":"This study aimed to explore the therapy role of procyanidin B2 (PB2) in inhibiting angiogenesis and cell growth in oral squamous cell carcinoma. After oral mucosa epithelial cell (OMEC) and human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line (SCC-25) were treated with PB2 or SCC-25 were treated with PB2 and rhVEGF, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine the cell viability. The apoptosis, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of SCC-25 after indicated treatment were detected by Tunel, wound healing, transwell and tube formation assays. The protein expression related to apoptosis, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and changed expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling was analyzed by Western blot. As a result, PB2 inhibited viability, invasion, migration and EMT and promoted apoptosis of SCC-25 cells. In addition, PB2 inhibited VEGF\/VEGFR2 signaling and tumor itangiogenesis in OSCC. As expected, activation of VEGF\/VEGFR2 signaling suppressed the effect of PB2 on growth and metastasis of OSCC cells. In conclusion, PB2 inhibited the VEGF\/VEGFR2 pathway to suppress the angiogenesis and cell growth of SCC-25 cells.","403":null,"404":null,"405":"Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) are a class of pluripotent stem cells isolated from the adipose tissue; they can differentiate into osteoblasts after induction and play an important role in bone repair. EGFL6 protein is secreted by adipocytes and osteoblasts and can promote endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. This study aimed to explore the effect of recombinant EGFL6 protein on the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. The cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. Alizarin red staining and alkaline phosphatase staining were used to detect the osteogenic differentiation ability. mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Protein expression was determined using Western blotting. The osteogenic differentiation ability of ADSCs isolated from the adipose tissue was significantly weakened after EGFL6 knockdown; this ability was restored upon the addition of EGFL6 recombinant protein. BMP2 knockdown inhibited the effect of EGFL6 recombinant protein on osteogenic differentiation. EGFL6 recombinant protein promoted osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs through the BMP2\/SMAD4 signaling pathway. This may provide a potential target for the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs.","406":"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignant tumor in children with T-cell ALL (T-ALL), accounting for approximately 15% of all cases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of T-ALL. The present study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of action of lncRNA EBLN3P in T-ALL. We used quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine the expression of lncRNA endogenous bornavirus-like nucleoprotein (EBLN3P), microRNA (miR)-655-3p, and the transcription level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and Western blot assay to quantify the protein expression level of cleaved-caspase3, caspase3, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and MMP-9. The potential binding sites between lncRNA EBLN3P and miR-655-3p were predicted using StarBase, and the interaction was further verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay. The proliferation ability of Jurkat cells was detected using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, and their invasion and migration ability using transwell assay. Cell apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry (FCM) assay. The expression of lncRNA EBLN3P was upregulated while that of miR-655-3p was downregulated in human T-ALL cell lines and lncRNA EBLN3P negatively regulated miR-655-3p. LncRNA EBLN3P knockdown significantly inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of Jurkat cells and induced their apoptosis. Downregulating miR-655-3p reversed the effects of lncRNA EBLN3P knockdown on Jurkat cells. In conclusion, we confirmed for the first time that lncRNA EBLN3P is dysregulated in T-ALL cell lines, and lncRNA EBLN3P knockdown inhibited the malignant biological behaviors of T-ALL cells by up-regulating miR-655-3p.","407":"This study aims to explore the regulatory mechanism of SNAI2 in ovarian cancer, and to uncover its correlation with ferroptosis. A human normal ovarian cell line IOSE-80 and four ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3, A2780 and CAOV3) were applied to detect SNAI2 and ferrptosis level, and an elevated SNAI2 expression and the occurrence of ferroptosis were observed in ovarian cancer cells, especially in SKOV3 cells. Then, results from a series of cellular behaviors experiments revealed that SNAI2 knockdown greatly suppressed cell viability, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis, as well as promoting the occurrence of ferroptosis in SKOV3 cells. The effects of SNAI2 knockdown on SKOV3 cells were similar to erastin, an inducer of ferroptosis. Subsequently, SNAI2 was verified to directly bind to the promoter of SLC7A11 by luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Furthermore, mice were subcutaneously injected with SKOV3 cells to induce tumor formation. Erastin exhibited an anti-tumor effect on mice suffering from ovarian cancer, which was partly weakened by SNAI2 overexpression. In conclusion, this study disclosed that SNAI2 knockdown or erastin exhibited an anti-tumor activity in ovarian cancer by promoting ferroptosis, shedding new insights of the regulatory mechanism of SNAI2-mediated ferroptosis in ovarian cancer.","408":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), a common thyroid cancer (TC) subtype, rapidly increases in occurrence. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are non-coding small RNAs, have been demonstrated to play a role in cancer pathogenic mechanisms. Although miR-143 is involved in suppressing certain malignant tumor progression, its biological role is unknown in PTC. The present study found that miR-143 levels were strongly lower in PTC patient samples and cell lines, implying that miR-143 may play a biological role in PTC. Down-regulation of miR-143 resulted in the increased expression of HMGA2. Furthermore, HMGA2 was found to be a direct target of miR-143. A dual-luciferase assay confirmed a direct binding site for miR-143 was confirmed on HMGA2 using a dual-luciferase assay. Next, over-expression of miR-143 suppressed PTC cell growth as analyzed by MTT, clone formation, and Ki-67 immunofluorescence staining assays. miR-143 mimics transfection downregulated the expression of PCNA, CDK4, CDK1, and Cyclin E1. In addition, wound healing and trans-well assays revealed that miR-143 up-regulation inhibited PTC cells invasion and migration. Co-transfection of HMGA2 expression vector restored HMGA2 expression and rescued PTC cells proliferation capability in miR-143 mimics transfected PTC cells, indicating that miR-143 inhibited PTC cells proliferation via HMGA2. These observations were also obtained in xenografts experiments in nude mice. Altogether, our study shed light on miR-143's anti-cancer biological functions in PTC progression through targeting HMGA2, suggesting that restoration of miR-143 could be a potential therapeutic approach for PTC treatment.","409":null,"410":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in multiple physiological processes. However, whether circRNAs function as the indicators of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. Three LUAD-related microarray datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and overlapping differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) in LUAD were identified. circ_0007618 and circ_0029426 were revealed to be significantly dysregulated in LUAD and verified in LUAD tissues and serum obtained in this study. Subsequently, the overall survival curve and receiver operating characteristics curve analyses were performed to evaluate the prognosis, sensitivity, and specificity of circ_0007618 and circ_0029426 for LUAD diagnosis. The results indicate that the combination of circ_0007618 and circ_0029426 is a potential biomarker for LUAD diagnosis and prognosis. TargetScan and miRDB were used to predict interactions between microRNAs (miRNAs) and circRNAs\/mRNAs. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was established for LUAD diagnosis. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and protein-protein interaction network identified four hub genes. In conclusion, circ_0007618 and circ_0029426 may be novel biomarkers for LUAD diagnosis and prognosis.

Cell proliferation, colony numbers, and cisplatin resistance were determined in A431 or cisplatin-resistant A431 (A431-R) cells that were first transfected with miR-30c-inhibitor or miR-30c-mimic, respectively, and then treated with different concentrations of lidocaine, cisplatin, or both. The expression levels of miR-30c and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in A431 and A431-R cells were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Lidocaine suppressed A431 cell proliferation and cisplatin resistance in a dose- and time-dependent manner via the miR-30c\/SIRT1 pathway. MiR-30c overexpression also suppressed cell proliferation and cisplatin resistance in A431 cells by directly targeting and downregulating SIRT1, thus enhancing the protective effects of lidocaine. Conversely, SIRT1 upregulation or miR-30c inhibition antagonized the inhibitory effects of lidocaine. Our results suggest that lidocaine may suppress the progression of cSCC by activating the miR-30c\/SIRT1 pathway, indicating its promising potential as a treatment strategy for cSCC.","412":"The key role of circular RNA (circRNA) in the malignant progression of cancers has been demonstrated. However, the role of circRNA midline-1 (circMID1) in prostate cancer (PCa) progression has not been clarified. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure relative expression. Function analysis was performed using EdU staining, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, transwell assay and cell glycolysis detection. The protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis. RNA pull-down assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were performed to verify RNA interaction. Animal experiments were utilized to explore the effects of circMID1 knockdown on PCa tumorigenesis in vivo. Our results showed that circMID1 was upregulated in PCa tissues and cells and its knockdown inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis in vitro, as well as PCa tumorigenesis in vivo. IGF1R and YTHDC2 were highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells, and their expression was positively regulated by circMID1. IGF1R and YTHDC2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of circMID1 silencing on PCa cell progression. In terms of mechanism, circMID1 could sponge miR-330-3p and miR-330-3p could target IGF1R and YTHDC2. Functional experiments showed that circMID1 sponged miR-330-3p to regulate PCa progression via the YTHDC2\/IGF1R\/AKT axis.

Although many circular RNAs are found to be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis, more circular RNA regulators still need to be identified, to improve the understanding of the regulatory networks of atherosclerosis. Here, we found that hsa_circ_0008896 was significantly up-regulated in both in vitro and in vivo atherosclerosis models, indicating hsa_circ_0008896 was involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Further functional analyses confirmed that knockdown of hsa_circ_0008896 decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of VSMCs. In addition, we conducted bioinformatics analysis and found that hsa-miR-633 could directly bind to hsa_circ_0008896, which was confirmed by RNA immune-precipitation (RIP) assays. Results of proliferation, migration, and invasion assays showed that hsa-miR-633 inhibitor reversed the si-circ_0008896 phenotypes, indicating that hsa_circ_0008896 functionally bound to hsa-miR-633. At last, combining bioinformatics and experimental analyses, we found the protein target of hsa_circ_0008896\/hsa-miR-633, CDC20B (cell division cycle 20B).

This study was aimed to investigate the functional role of long non-coding RNA Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha-antisense RNA 2 (lncRNA HIF1A-AS2) in AD. An in vitro model of AD was established by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-mediated human aortic Smooth Muscle Cells (SMCs). HIF1A-AS2 expression in human AD tissues was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays, followed by investigation of biological roles of HIF1A-AS2 in AD development by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), immunofluorescence, and transwell assays. Additionally, the correlation between HIF1A-AS2, miR-33b, and high mobility group AT-hook2 (HMGA2) were identified by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays. Results showed that HIF1A-AS2 was obviously increased, while the contractile-phenotype markers of vascular SMCs were significantly decreased in human AD tissues, when compared to normal tissues. Inhibition of HIF1A-AS2 attenuated SMCs proliferation and migration, whereas enhanced the phenotypic switch under the stimulation of PDGF-BB. Results from RIP, RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-33b directly bound with HIF1A-AS2, and HIF1A-AS2 silencing suppressed the expression of HMGA2, which was induced by miR-33b inhibitor. In conclusion, knockdown of HIF1A-AS2 suppressed the proliferation and migration, while promoted the phenotypic switching of SMCs through miR-33b\/HMGA2 axis, which laid a theoretical foundation for understanding the development of AD and shed light on a potential target for AD treatment.","416":"To investigate the mechanism of paternally expressed gene (PEG10) in regulating neuroblastoma (NB) progression. PEG10 expression was detected using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

The NB cell viability, proliferation, invasion, and migration were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, and Transwell assay. The mRNA and protein levels were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The levels of PEG10 and RPS2 were remarkably increased in NB tissues and cells, nevertheless the expression of miR-449a was conspicuously declined in NB tissues and cells. Silencing of PEG10 inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion in SK-N-BE (2) cells, while overexpression of PEG10 promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in SH-SY5Y cells. We affirmed that PEG10 interacted with miR-449a, and miR-449a could target the 3'UTR of RPS2 and negatively regulate its expression in NB cells. The upregulation of miR-449a inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion in SK-N-BE (2) cells, while downregulation of miR-449a promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, miR-449a overexpression weaken the function of PEG10-mediated on promoting proliferation, migration, and invasion in SH-SY5Y cells, while RPS2 overexpression rescued the effects of miR-449a-mediated on inhibiting those behaviors of SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, Silencing of PEG10 could inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion via the miR-449a\/RPS2 axis in NB cells.","417":"Microvascular dysfunction causes mortality in the presence of sepsis and multi-organ failure. Previous studies have demonstrated that exogenous administration of exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) protects against sepsis, improves organ function, decreases vascular leakage and increases survival. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism was largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, a mouse sepsis model based on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was constructed. Exosomes from various ADSCs were intravenously administered at 4 h post CLP. Treatment with ADSC exosomes (Exo), particularly those with hypoxic pretreatment (HExo), enhanced survival, suppressed renal vascular leakage and decreased kidney dysfunction in septic mice. HExo ameliorated sepsis-induced increases in chemokine and cytokine plasma levels. Furthermore, the HExo circRNA content, determined through next-generation sequencing, revealed abundant mmu_circ_0001295. Further studies demonstrated that downregulation of exosomal mmu_circ_0001295 suppressed the exosomes' protective effects against sepsis. HExo prevented microvascular dysfunction, thus potentially improving sepsis outcomes via mmu_circ_0001295 delivery. In summary, the data indicated that HExo elongate sepsis-induced renal injury through delivering mmu_circ_0001295.","418":"In the past decades, considerable attention has been directed toward anaerobic digestion (AD), which is an effective biological process for converting diverse organic wastes into biogas, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), biohydrogen, etc. The microbial bioprocessing takes part during AD is of substantial significance, and one of the crucial approaches for the deep and adequate understanding and manipulating it toward different products is process microbiology.

However, the role and mechanism of circHIPK3 in HCC are still unclear. To investigate its function, circHIPK3 expression was first determined by RT-qPCR in HCC tissues or cells. Functionally, cell proliferation and invasion were investigated by CCK-8, EdU, or Transwell assays. In terms of understanding the mechanism, the interaction of the circRNA HIPK3\/micro RNA 124 (miRNA 124) or micro RNA 506 (miRNA506) \/PDK2 regulatory loop was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In addition, a xenograft tumor model was established to confirm the impact of circHIPK3 on the growth of HCC cells in vivo. We found that circHIPK3 was upregulated in HCC patients and associated with clinical characteristics, while miR-124 and miR-506 were downregulated in HCC patients. Additionally, we proved that knock down of circHIPK3 remarkably suppressed the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. Mechanistically, circHIPK3 directly bound to miR-124 or miR-506 and inhibited their expression, and PDK2 was a target gene of miR-124 or miR-506. Moreover, circHIPK3 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-124 or miR-506 on HCC progression. miR-124 or miR-506 could also suppress tumorigenesis of HCC cells by PDK2. Furthermore, in vivo evidence confirmed that knock down of circHIPK3 inhibited tumor formation. We suggest that circHIPK3 can accelerate the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells by sponging miR-124 or miR-506 to upregulate PDK2, which is the underlying mechanism of circHIPK3-induced HCC progression.","420":null,"421":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are associated with the progression of gastric cancer (GC).

The relationship between hsa_circ_0119412, miR-1298-5p, and ZBED3 was confirmed by luciferase, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down assays. Our data revealed that hsa_circ_0119412 and ZBED3 expression was upregulated in GC, while miR-1298-5p expression was downregulated. Both the knockdown of hsa_circ_0119412\/ZBED3 and miR-1298-5p overexpression inhibited GC cell growth and invasion, and enhanced cell apoptosis, while miR-1298-5p interference or ZBED3 overexpression showed the opposite trend.

Here, we aim to investigate the role of hypoxia-induced autophagy and the mechanistic actions of the bioinformatically identified BNIP3 in BC. The expression pattern of BNIP3 in BC tissues and cell lines was examined using RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses. The binding affinity among BNIP3, BECN1 and BCL-2 was characterized by co-immunoprecipitation. BNIP3 expression was manipulated to assess its effects on BC cell malignant phenotypes, evaluated by cell counting kit-8, Transwell and wound healing assays, and on BC autophagy under hypoxic conditions. A BC tumor xenografts mouse model was further established to substantiate in vitro findings. Up-regulated expression of BNIP3 was found in BC tissues and cell lines, and BNIP3 expression was positively correlated with hypoxia exposure duration. BNIP3 knockdown restricted BC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration under hypoxic conditions. BNIP3 activated BC cell autophagy by inhibiting the binding between BCL-2 and BECN1 under hypoxic conditions. BNIP3-induced autophagy activation enhanced malignant phenotypes of BC cells, thus accelerating the tumorigenesis of BC cells in vivo. These data collectively supported the tumor-promoting role of BNIP3 in autophagy activation of BC under hypoxic conditions, highlighting a potential therapeutic target against BC.","423":"The exact mechanism of miR-15a-5p shuttled by human umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUC-MSCs-Exo) in Wilms tumor (WT) was estimated. WT tissues were collected clinically. miR-15a-5p and septin 2 (SEPT2) expression levels were examined in tissues . hUC-MSCs-Exo were transfected with miR-15a-5p-related oligonucleotides and co-cultured with WT cells (G-401). In addition, SEPT2 loss-of-function was performed in G-401 cells. The biological functions of G-401 cells after treatments were evaluated. Moreover, tumor formation tests further assessed the role of exosomal miR-15a-5p in WT. The miR-15a-5p level was lower and the SEPT2 level was higher in WT. hUC-MSCs-Exo impaired the biological functions of G-401 cells. hUC-MSCs-Exo carried upregulated miR-15a-5p into G-401 cells, thereby lessening the tumorigenic properties of G-401 cells. Inhibition of SEPT2 suppressed the biological function of WT cells and upregulated SEPT2 reversed hUC-MSCs-Exo-mediated inhibition of G-401 cell growth. The tumorigenicity of G-401 cells in mice was impaired by hUC-MSCs-Exo overexpressing miR-15a-5p. The data prove that miR-15a-5p shuttled by hUC-MSCs-Exo negatively regulates SEPT2 expression, and disrupts WT cell growth in vivo and in vitro.","424":"Cholangiocarcinoma (abbreviated as CCA) accounts for about 3% of digestive tract tumors, which is a rare disease with relatively low incidence.

Next, by conducting miR-23a-3p knockdown system in HUCCT1 cells and miR-23a-3p overexpression system in RBE cells, we investigated the biological effects of miR-23a-3p. Based on our findings, inhibition of miR-23a-3p was able to prevent cancer cell proliferation via colony formation, CCK-8, as well as EdU assays. Moreover, invasion as well as migration abilities of cells was examined by transwell assay and wound healing test.

This study aimed to explore the role of circHIPK3 in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC). PTEN is a kind of tumor suppressor gene, which is very commonly lost in human cancer. We detected the expression of circHIPK3 and PTEN in plasma samples from DC patients, diabetic patients without complications diabetes mellitus (DM) and health controls by RT-qPCR and ELISA. In vitro cell experiment, AC16 cells (cardiomyocytes) were treated with high glucose, followed by expression analysis of circHIPK3 and PTEN mRNA by RT-qPCR. CircHIPK3 or PTEN expression vector were used to overexpress circHIPK3 and PTEN in AC16 cells to explore the relationship between them. The role of circHIPK3 and PTEN in regulating the apoptosis of AC16 cells was analyzed by cell apoptosis assay. The result showed that CircHIPK3 was downregulated in diabetes and further downregulated in DC. In AC16 cells, high glucose treatment decreased the expression levels of circHIPK3. Across DC samples, the expression of circHIPK3 was inversely correlated with PTEN. In AC16 cells, overexpression of circHIPK3 decreased the expression levels of PTEN. CircHIPK3 may suppress AC16 cell apoptosis induced by high glucose and inhibited the role of PTEN in cell apoptosis.

Our preliminary sequencing data revealed their altered expression in hemangioma and predicted they could interact with each other. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the roles of BRCAT54 and miR-1269b in hemangioma, with a focus on their interaction. In this study, hemangioma samples donated by 20 infantile hemangioma patients at proliferating-phase and 20 infantile hemangioma patients at involuting-phase were used. The expression of BRCAT54 and miR-1269b in hemangioma samples, as well as hemangioma-derived endothelial cells (HDECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were detected by RT-qPCR. IntaRNA 2.0 was applied to predict the interaction between BRCAT54 and miR-1269b, which was then confirmed by RNA-RNA pulldown assay. Accumulation of BRCAT54 in the subcellular location of HDECs was detected by subcellular fractionation assay. The role of BRCAT54 and miR-1269b in cell proliferation has been explored by the BrdU assay. Compared to proliferating-phase tissues, involuting-phase tissues exhibited decreased expression levels of BRCAT54 and increased expression levels of miR-1269b. HDECs had decreased expression levels of BRCAT54 and increased expression levels of miR-1269b compared to that of HUVECs. In HDECs, BRCAT54, which was detected in both nuclear and cytoplasm fractions, directly interacted with miR-1269b. BRCAT54 and miR-1269b did not affect the expression of each other, while BRCAT54 suppressed the role of miR-1269b in enhancing the proliferation of HDECs. BRCAT54 may sponge miR-1269b to suppress the proliferation of HDECs.","428":null,"429":null,"430":"Cobalt is the main component of metal prostheses in hip arthroplasty.

Therefore, elucidating the underlying mechanisms of metal prosthesis action, coupled with identification of effective detoxification drugs are imperative to minimizing postoperative complications and prolonging the service life of these clinical tools. In this study, we treated Balb\/3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line with CoNPs and ferrostatin-1, then measured cell viability via the CCK-8 assay. Next, we determined levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), cobalt and iron contents, as well as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) expression in each group. Finally, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to detect changes in the ultrastructure of each group of cells. Exposure of cells to CoNPs significantly suppressed their viability, and downregulated expression of GSH, GPX4, and SLC7A11 proteins. Conversely, this treatment mediated a significant increase in ROS, MDA, cobalt, and iron levels in the cells. TEM images revealed a marked increase in density of the mitochondrial membrane of cells in the CoNPs group, while the outer membrane was broken. Notably, treatment with ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 alleviated the cytotoxic response caused by CoNPs. These findings suggest that CoNP-induced cytotoxicity may be closely related to ferroptosis, indicating that inhibition of ferroptosis is a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing CoNP toxicity.","431":null,"432":"Circular RNA (circRNA) plays a crucial role in the establishment and progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

The results showed that circSETD3 was upregulated in NPC tissues and was related to DDP resistance to NPC. Functional experiments revealed that circSETD3 knockdown inhibited NPC proliferation and increased DDP sensitivity and apoptosis rate. The promotion effect of circSETD3 overexpression on NPC proliferation and DDP resistance and inhibition effect on apoptosis was reversed by elevated miR-147a. CircSETD3 knockdown or miR-147a overexpression prevented Akt\/mTOR pathway's activation. In terms of the mechanism, circSETD3 acted as a sponge for miR-147a. Xenotransplantation experiments showed that knockdown circSETD3 or DDP treatment could restrain tumor growth, and the effect of DDP was enhanced by knockdown of circSETD3. In conclusion, the results of this study confirm that circSETD3 promotes NPC proliferation and DDP resistance by regulating miR-147a, and circSETD3\/miR-147a axis may serve as a potential therapeutic target for NPC in the future.","433":"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high lethality, and quercitrin exhibits anticancer characteristics. Here, we attempted to uncover the anticancer activity of quercitrin in LUAD. In this work, quercitrin prohibited the cell viability and clone-formation of LUAD cells in vitro. Meanwhile, quercitrin treatment reduced the aggressive phenotypes in LUAD cells. Further, Gap Junction Protein Beta 2 (GJB2) expression was aberrantly higher in LUAD when compared within control tissue. The higher expression of GJB2 is associated with an inferior overall survival for patients with LUAD. Finally, the reintroduction of GJB2 offset the inhibiting influence of quercitrin in LUAD cells.

LUAD cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis was determined. The targeting relationship between SORBS1 and miR-3646 was verified by dual luciferase and RNA pull-down assays. In vivo assays were performed to verify the in vitro results. The expression of miR-3646 was found to be upregulated in LUAD tissues and cells. MiR-3646 overexpression stimulated the proliferation and adhesion of LUAD cells but inhibite d apoptosis, whereas a miR-3646 inhibitor produced the opposite results. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of miR-3646 inhibitor was verified in vivo. SORBS1, a target gene identified downstream of miR-3646, was downregulated in LUAD tissues and cells. Additionally, increased SORBS1 inhibited the malignant phenotypes of LUAD cells, which was restored by miR-3646 upregulation. Additionally, western blot analysis revealed that SORBS1 ectopic expression disrupted the JNK signaling pathway, and this effect was restored by miR-3646 overexpression. Thus, this study revealed that miR-3646 promotes LUAD cell proliferation and adhesion, and reduces apoptosis by directly downregulating SORBS1 via the JNK signaling pathway.

Thus, there is an urgent need to elucidate the mechanism through which GBM cells acquire TMZ resistance. FOXD3-AS1, a recently discovered lncRNA, shows high expression in diverse cancer types. Nonetheless, its role in GBM remains unclear. This study found that FOXD3-AS1 was overexpressed in GBM cells and associated with dismal prognostic outcome in GBM patients. Functional studies revealed that depletion of FOXD3-AS1 inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis of GBM cells. Results also showed that FOXD3-AS1 participates in the tolerance of GBM cells to TMZ. Specifically, TMZ-resistant cells exhibited higher FOXD3-AS1 expression compared to parental cells. Overexpression of FOXD3-AS1 increased TMZ tolerance in TMZ sensitive cells, whereas depletion of FOXD3-AS1 sensitized TMZ-resistant cells to TMZ treatment. Mechanistically, WEE1 was positively expressed with FOXD3-AS1. Given that both FOXD3-AS1 and WEE1 contain a binding site for miR-128-3p, FOXD3-AS1 could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to promote WEE1 expression by sponging miR-128-3p. Furthermore, we demonstrated that WEE1 was upregulated in TMZ-resistant GBM cells. Overexpression of WEE1 increased TMZ tolerance in TMZ sensitive cells, whereas deletion of FOXD3-AS1 promoted TMZ-resistant cells to be more sensitive to TMZ. Importantly, depletion of WEE1 could reverse TMZ resistant phenotype in FOXD3-AS1-overexpressed GBM cells.

The role of BBOX1-AS1 and miR-146b in the apoptosis of COV434 cells was evaluated by cell apoptosis assay. Overexpression assay was applied to explore the relationship between BBOX1-AS1 and miR-146b. We found that the expression levels of BBOX1-AS1 were increased, while the expression levels of miR-146b were decreased in POF patients. BBOX1-AS1-WT, but not BBOX1-AS1-mut, directly interacted with miR-146b. BBOX1-AS1 was detected in both nucleus and cytoplasm, while they did not affect the expression of each other. BBOX1-AS1 suppressed the role of miR-146b in cell apoptosis. Therefore, BBOX1-AS1 may increase the apoptosis of granulosa cells in POF by sponging miR-146b.","449":null,"450":null,"451":"Carvedilol possess multiple functions such as antioxidation and neuroprotection RhoA\/ROCK is reported to participate in acute lung injury (ALI). The aim of the present study was to explore the role of carvedilol in LPS-induced ALI. BEAS2B cells were subjected to LPS for the construction of in vitro ALI model. After that, the protective effects of carvedilol were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). The activities of RhoA\/ROCK were then measured to confirm its association with carvedilol by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. Then, the cell viability, inflammatory responses, oxidative stress and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), oxidative stress detection kits, and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) respectively. Inflammation- and apoptosis-related markers were also measured by Western blot. The cell viability reduced by LPS in BEAS2B cells was elevated by carvedilol. Moreover, RhoA\/ROCK were found to be suppressed by carvedilol administration. The cell viability, inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis of LPS-induced BEAS2B cells were aggravated upon RhoA was overexpressed. Collectively, carvedilol exerts a protective effect against LPS-induced injury that could be ascribed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative character through modulating the RhoA\/ROCK activities.","452":null,"453":null,"454":"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication of sepsis. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), an enzyme involved in aldehyde metabolism, exerts a protective effect against sepsis. This study investigated the possible mechanisms underlying the roles of ALDH2, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis in sepsis-induced lung injury. A mouse model of sepsis-induced lung injury was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP); lung morphology was evaluated by calculation of lung coefficient, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and electron microscopy. Malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) protein expression levels were used to detect the level of lipid oxidative stress. In addition, total iron was detected using an iron detection kit, and the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins (PTGS2, GPX4), pyroptosis-related proteins, and ALDH2 was examined using western blotting. To further examine the likely mechanisms, the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin 1 (Fer-1), NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950, and ALDH2 activator Alda-1 were added. CLP-treated mice exhibited destruction of lung tissue morphology, lipid peroxidation injury, iron content, and increased lung PTGS2 protein expression, accompanied by a decrease in GPX4 protein expression. CLP also downregulated ALDH2 expression and increased the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis-related proteins. These adverse effects of CLP were relieved by Alda-1, Fer-1, and MCC950 treatment. In conclusion, both pyroptosis and ferroptosis participate in CLP-induced ALI, and ALDH2 plays a protective role by reducing pyroptosis and ferroptosis. This study provides a scientific basis for the treatment of lung injury in sepsis.","455":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are closely linked with human cancer development such as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the characteristics and specific functions of most circRNAs in NSCLC remained unknown. Previous studies have suggested that circRNA SOD2 (CircSOD2) expression was upregulated in a number of cancers. This study aimed to explore the functions of circSOD2 in NSCLC advancement with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Expression profile analysis of circSOD2, miR-2355-5p, and calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2 (CAMSAP2) was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Transwell assay, cell migration assay, CCK8, ELISA, RIP assay, RNA pull-down assay, and Western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the functions of circSOD2, miR-2355-5p, and CAMSAP2. We found elevated expression of circSOD2 and CAMSAP2 while reduced expression of miR-2355-5p in NSCLC tumor tissues. Silencing or overexpression of CircSOD2 resulted in increased or decreased expression of miR-2355-5p, respectively. Mechanically, we showed that silencing of CircSOD2 and overexpression of miR-2355-5p resulted in the reduced rate of NSCLC cell proliferation. Inhibition of miR-2355-5p reversed the changes induced via silencing of CircSOD2. MiR-2355-5p binds to the CircSOD2 promoter and triggered its stimulation, which further activated circSOD2 expression. CircSOD2 suppression impaired lung cancer cell growth, cell migration, prohibited cell cycle progression, and in vivo tumor growth by targeting miR-2355-5p expression in NSCLC tissues. Meanwhile, increased expression of CAMSAP2 reversed the changes stimulated by the elevated level of miR-2355-5p in NSCLC progression. This innovative signaling axis CircSOD2\/miR-2355-5p\/CAMSAP2 illustrated the new horizon to investigate NSCLC tumorigenesis and provided new prognosis and treatment of NSCLC.","456":"Long non-coding RNA RGMB-AS1 (RGMB antisense RNA 1) plays a crucial role in tumor progression.

ZFAS1 is a newly identified and characterized lncRNA linked to a variety of cancers. The role of ZFAS1 in osteosarcoma is mainly unknown. This study discovered that ZFAS1 was upregulated in osteosarcoma patient tissues, which correlates with elevated SRSF3 protein levels. Higher levels of ZFAS1 or SRSF3 were linked to a poor prognosis of osteosarcoma. ZFAS1 knockdown decreased SRSF3 protein levels but had a negligible effect on SRSF3 mRNA expression. Further research indicated that ZFAS1 could bind to the SRSF3 protein directly and prevent degrading. Functional studies revealed that ZFAS1 knockdown inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation as measured by the CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and Ki-67 immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, ZFAS1 knockdown reduced the expression of PCNA, CDK1, CDK4, and CDK6, increasing p53 and p16. IT has also been observed that ZFAS1 knockdown inhibited osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion as measured by the wound healing assay and the trans-well assay with or without Matrigel.Furthermore, exogenous SRSF3 expression in ZFAS1-depleted osteosarcoma cells restored SRSF3 expression while simultaneously inhibiting cell proliferation and metastasis. Our findings show that ZFAS1 plays an essential role in osteosarcoma progression by stabilizing the SRSF3 protein. Our study provides novel insight into the role of ZFAS1 in osteosarcoma.

Forty nucleus pulposus (NP) IDD tissues and 40 NP tissues of intervertebral discs without apparent degeneration were collected. TBHP was used to induce IDD. Cell proliferation was measured using the MTT and EdU assays. Pyroptosis was detected using flow cytometry. RT-qPCR and Western blot assays were performed to determine mRNA, miRNA, and protein expression. Dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays were performed to verify the relationship between LINC00917 or NLRP1 and miR-149-5p. LINC00917 expression was enhanced in TBHP-treated nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). The knockdown of LINC00917 promoted proliferation and inhibited cytotoxicity, inflammatory response, and pyroptosis of NPCs. LINC00917 functions as a sponge for miR-149-5p. Having silenced miR-149-5p, the effects of LINC00917 knockdown on NPC proliferation and inflammation-induced pyroptosis were alleviated.

To the best of our knowledge, the role of Pae in diabetic cataracts has not yet been reported. Human lens epithelial SRA01\/04 cells were induced by high glucose (HG) and subsequently treated with Pae. Cell viability was detected using the MTT assay. Moreover, LDH levels were detected. Immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blotting were used to determine the protein expression levels of N-cadherin and E-cadherin. ELISA was performed to determine oxidative stress-related indicator levels. TUNEL and Western blotting detected the apoptotic rate. The mRNA and protein expression levels of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in SRA01\/04 cells were measured via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Subsequently, cell transfection techniques were used to inhibit the expression of SIRT1 in cells. MTT, ELISA, IF, Western blotting and TUNEL assays were used to investigate the mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oxidative damage with Pae in the diabetic cataract. Pae significantly increased cell viability and possibly inhibit the EMT and oxidative damage of SRA01\/04 cells induced by HG. Pae was demonstrated to upregulate SIRT1 expression levels. The results therefore suggested that the downregulation of SIRT1 reversed the protective effect of Pae on EMT and oxidative damage in SRA01\/04 cells induced by HG. In conclusion, Pae may inhibit EMT of lens epithelial cells and reduce oxidative damage in diabetic cataracts via the upregulation of SIRT1.","468":"Metastasis and chemoresistance are the leading causes of death in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) may be useful as diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic markers for HCC. In this study, we set out to investigate the possible role of miR-381 in HCC development and chemoresistance along with the related mechanism. Microarray-based gene expression profiling was carried out to analyze the expression of SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) and histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) followed by validation in clinical HCC tissues and cells. The potential binding between miR-381 and SETDB1 was found and verified. Then, the role of SETDB1 in HCC in relation to miR-381 and protein kinase B (AKT) pathway was explored through gain- and loss-of-function approaches. After expression determination of EZH2, SETDB1, miR-381, and AKT pathway-related factors, their reactions were analyzed and their functional roles in HCC progression and chemoresistance were investigated in vitro and in vivo. SETDB1 was aberrantly upregulated in clinical HCC tissues and cells. This upregulation activated AKT pathway by promoting its tri-methylation on K64. SETDB1 promoted the proliferation, migration and chemoresistance through the AKT pathway in HCC cells. In a xenograft mouse model, SETDB1 promoted HCC cell tumorigenesis in vivo by activating the AKT pathway. Furthermore, EZH2 suppressed miR-381 by catalyzing the activity of H3K27me3 on its promoter region. In conclusion, EZH2 suppressed miR-381 expression by promoting H3K27me3 activity on its promoter region to facilitate SETDB1 expression, thereby activating the AKT pathway to promote hepatocarcinogenesis and chemoresistance.","469":null,"470":"Eriodictyol is a natural flavonoid with many pharmacological effects, such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, and neuroprotection. Besides, it has been reported that flavonoids play an important role in protein glycosylation. The fucosylation structure is closely associated with processes of various tumor metastases. TSTA3 is involved in the de novo synthesis and can convert cellular GDP-D-mannose into GDP-L-fucose. It was predicted on the STITCH database that eriodictyol interacted with TSTA3. In addition, literature has confirmed that TSTA3 is upregulated in CRC and can regulate the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Herein, the precise effects of eriodictyol on the clone-forming, proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of CRC cells as well as EMT process were assessed. Moreover, the correlation among eriodictyol, TSTA3, and fucosylation in these malignant behaviors of CRC cells was evaluated, in order to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The current work discovered that eriodictyol inhibited the viability, clone-formation, proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of CRC cells, and that these inhibitory effects of eriodictyol on the malignant behavior of CRC cells were reversed by TSTA3 overexpression. Additionally, eriodictyol suppresses fucosylation by downregulating the TSTA3 expression. Results confirmed that fucosylation inhibitor (2-F-Fuc) inhibited clone formation, proliferation, migration, invasion, as well as EMT of CRC cells and eriodictyol treatment further reinforced the suppressing effects of 2-F-Fuc on the malignant behavior of CRC cells. We conclude that eriodictyol suppresses the clone-forming, proliferative, migrative and invasive abilities of CRC cells as well as represses the EMT process by downregulating TSTA3 expression to restrain fucosylation.","471":"Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) plays an essential role in the development or progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression during normal and pathophysiological events. Here, we explored the functions and detailed mechanisms of miR-378a-3p and PD-L1 in HCC progression. First, miR-378a-3p was selected by analyzing miRNA levels in two HCC Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. We found that miR-378a-3p levels exhibited a downward trend in HCC and were negatively correlated with PD-L1 levels. Additionally, a dual luciferase assay predicted that miR-378a-3p directly targets PD-L1. Moreover, the transfection of miR-378a-3p mimics into Li-7 and HuH-7 cells effectively decreased the PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression levels, and inhibited Treg differentiation in co-culture models by modulating the expression levels of certain cytokines. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-378a-3p hindered cell proliferation and migration but facilitated apoptosis by repressing STAT3 signaling in HCC cells. In conclusion, miR-378a-3p appears to inhibit HCC tumorigenesis by regulating PD-L1 and STAT3 levels. Thus, miR-378a-3p may be a potential target for HCC therapy.","472":null,"473":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of cancer.

Luciferase reporter gene analysis and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were used to validate the target gene interactions predicted by starBase. A xenograft tumor experiment was conducted to validate the in vivo outcomes. The expression levels of LINC00115 and PFKFB2 in RB tissues were higher than those in normal tissues, while miR-489-3p showed the opposite trend. Silencing of LINC00115 inhibited the proliferation and migration of SO-RB50 and HXO-RB44 cells. An inhibitory or facilitated effect on RB tumorigenesis was observed following PFKFB2 silencing or miR-489-3p overexpression, respectively. Moreover, LINC00115 aggravated RB progression by targeting miR-489-3p, which downregulated PFKFB2. This finding improves our understanding of the relationship between LINC00115 and RB.

In our study, mice in the model group lived under the condition of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) until they expressed behaviors like depression which were supposed to undergo chronic stress. We applied high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess mRNA expression and obtained transcription profiles in lung tissue from CUMS mice and control mice for analysis. In view of the prediction of high-throughput RNA sequences and bioinformatics software, and mRNA regulatory network was constructed. First, we conducted differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and obtained 282 DEGs between CUMS (group A) and the control model (group B). Then, we conducted functional and pathway enrichment analyses. In general, the function of upregulated regulated DEGs is related to immune and inflammatory responses. PPI network identified several essential genes, of which ten hub genes were related to the T cell receptor signaling pathway. qRT-PCR results verified the regulatory network of mRNA.

NPC cells were subjected to radiation therapy to construct the radiation therapy resistance NPC cell line. The levels of LHFPL3-AS1, miR-143-5p and HOXA6 in NPC cells and tissues were examined. LHFPL3-AS1, miR-143-5p or HOXA6 expression was changed and then transfected into radiation-resistant NPC cells to detect cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and cell apoptosis in vitro. The tumorigenesis in nude mice in vivo was conducted to detect tumor growth. The targeting relations among LHFPL3-AS1, miR-143-5p and HOXA6 were validated. It was discovered that LHFPL3-AS1 and HOXA6 expression was elevated while the miR-143-5p level was depleted in radiation-resistant NPC cells and NPC tissues. The silenced LHFPL3-AS1 or augmented miR-143-5p repressed the proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of radiation-resistant NPC cells, while accelerated cell apoptosis in vitro. Silenced LHFPL3-AS1 hindered tumor growth in vivo. MiR-143-5p deletion reversed the effects of reduced LHFPL3-AS1; while HOXA6 upregulation reversed the effects of enriched miR-143-5p. LHFPL3-AS1 sponged miR-143-5p that targeted HOXA6. It is concluded that the down-regulated LHFPL3-AS1 retards the development of radiation-resistant NPC cells via sponging miR-143-5p to modulate HOXA6.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of RAD51 recombinase (RAD51) in osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. We analyzed differentially expressed genes using microarray analysis. The osteogenic differentiation capability was analyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarin red staining assays. Osteogenesis and osteoclast related genes expression was detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting. The phosphorylation of Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATR serine\/threonine kinase (ATR) was tested using Western blotting. The effect of RAD51 on osteoporosis was also explored in vivo. The results showed that RAD51 was downregulated in osteoporosis, but upregulated in differentiated osteoblasts. Overexpression of RAD51 enhanced the differentiation of osteoblasts and suppressed the formation of osteoclasts. Furthermore, p-ATM and p-ATR levels were upregulated in osteoblasts and downregulated in osteoclasts. RAD51 expression was reduced by the ATM\/ATR pathway inhibitor AZ20. AZ20 treatment inhibited osteoblastogenesis and promoted osteoclastogenesis, whereas RAD51 reversed the effects induced by AZ20. Moreover, RAD51 improved bone microarchitecture in vivo. Taken together, ATM\/ATR signaling-mediated RAD51 promoted osteogenic differentiation and suppressed osteoclastogenesis.

Gene expression data in normal liver and liver cancer were acquired from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC). Chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq data (GSM1010876) in Cistrome Data Browser was used for searching transcriptional factors binding to the OPA3 promoter. HCC cell lines HLF and JHH2 were used for in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Results showed that OPA3 is significantly upregulated in HCC and associated with unfavorable prognosis. OPA3 knockdown impaired HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Besides, it decreased glucose uptake, lactate production, intracellular ATP levels, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of HLF and JHH2 cells. MYB Proto-Oncogene Like 2 (MYBL2) can bind to the promoter of OPA3 and enhance its transcription. MYBL2 knockdown decreased aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells.

Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell invasion assays coupled with Western blotting analysis using anti-Bax and anti-Bcl-2 antibodies were performed to evaluate cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis. Luciferase reporter and AGO2 RNA immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to verify the interaction between miR-197-3p and circ_0000285 or CKS1B. Xenograft tumor growth was evaluated in mice. We noted that circ_0000285 was highly expressed in glioma tissues and cells and that circ_0000285-silencing retarded tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. This effect was mediated by the binding of circ_0000285 to miR-197-3p, which silenced CKS1B, an essential driver of glioma cell proliferation and invasion.

EZH2 expression was determined and then silenced to assess its effect on depression-like behaviors and neuroinflammation. Microglia were isolated, cultured, identified and activated to assess EZH2 expression. Effect of EZH2 on microglia polarization was evaluated. Next, the binding relation between microRNA (miR)-29b-3p and EZH2 or matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) was analyzed. Levels of miR-29b-3p expression and MMP2 transcription were examined. Additionally, the role of miR-29b-3p in microglia polarization was tested. Depression-like behaviors were exhibited after CUMS induction. EZH2 was overexpressed in CUMS-treated rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglia. EZH2 silencing reversed depression-like behaviors. EZH2 silencing mitigated inflammation in depression by manipulating microglia M2-type polarization. EZH2 targeted miR-29b-3p expression to promote MMP2 transcription. Inhibition of miR-29b-3p reversed the role of EZH2 silencing in microglia M2-type polarization and promoted inflammation. EZH2 inhibited miR-29b-3p expression by combining with miR-29b-3p promoter and trimethylation of histone H3-lysine 27-trimethylated upregulation, and then elevated MMP2 transcription and triggered microglia M1-type polarization, thus exacerbating depression-like behaviors and neuroinflammation of depression.","484":null,"485":null,"486":"Co-microencapsulation is a growing technique in the food industry because it is a technique that, under the same fundamentals of microencapsulation, allows the generation of microcapsules with a longer shelf life, using a smaller number of encapsulating materials and a smaller amount of active compounds, while having a greater beneficial activity. This responds to consumer demand for higher quality foods that limit the use of ingredients with low nutritional content and provide beneficial health effects, such as probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins, fatty acids, and compounds with antioxidant activity.

Among the main active compounds used in this process are probiotics, prebiotics, fatty acids, and polyphenols, the main combination being that of probiotics with one of the other active compounds that enhances their benefits. The present review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the different encapsulating materials and techniques used to obtain co-microencapsulants, where the main result is a higher survival of probiotics, higher stability of the active compounds and a more controlled release, which can lead to the generation of new foods, food supplements, or therapeutic foods for the treatment of common ailments.","487":"The study aimed to identify the key active components in Silybum marianum (S. marianum) and determine how they protect against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). TCMSP, DisGeNET, UniProt databases, and Venny 2.1 software were used to identify 11 primary active components, 92 candidate gene targets, and 30 core hepatoprotective gene targets in this investigation, respectively. The PPI network was built using a string database and Cytoscape 3.7.2. The KEGG pathway and GO biological process enrichment, biological annotation, as well as the identified hepatoprotective core gene targets were analyzed using the Metascape database. The effect of silymarin on NAFLD was determined using H&amp;E on pathological alterations in liver tissues. The levels of liver function were assessed using biochemical tests. Western blot experiments were used to observe the proteins that were expressed in the associated signaling pathways on the hepatoprotective effect, which the previous network pharmacology predicted. According to the KEGG enrichment study, there are 35 hepatoprotective signaling pathways. GO enrichment analysis revealed that 61 biological processes related to the hepatoprotective effect of S. marianum were identified, which mainly involved in response to regulation of biological process and immune system process. Silymarin was the major ingredient derived from S. marianum, which exhibited the hepatoprotective effect by reducing the levels of ALT, AST, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, decreasing protein expressions of IL-6, MAPK1, Caspase 3, p53, VEGFA, increasing protein expression of AKT1.

Growing evidence has correlated the DIRAS3 gene with tumor progression, but its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rarely reported. Accordingly, the current study sought to evaluate the role and mechanism of DIRAS3 in NSCLC cell progression. First, we uncovered that DIRAS3 was poorly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cells. Subsequently, we examined the effect of DIRAS3 over-expression or knockdown in different lung cancer cells on their malignant phenotypes, with the help of transwell cell migration and invasion assays, and Western blot analyses. It was found that the over-expression of DIRAS3 inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 cells or H520 cells, whereas knockdown of DIRAS3 led to opposing trends. In addition, over-expression of DIRAS3 attenuated the tumor growth and reduced the number of lung tumor nodules. Mechanistically, DIRAS3 may inhibit the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by inhibiting the RAS\/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings indicate that DIRAS3 could serve as a potential therapeutic target biomarker for NSCLC.","491":null,"492":"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that are widely expressed in eukaryotic cells. However, their role has been poorly understood in GC. This report aimed to explore the biological functions of hsa_circ_0005230 and its action mechanism in GC. This study validated that hsa_circ_0005230 was significantly up-regulated in 130 cases of GC tissues using qRT-PCR, and clinicopathological feature analysis revealed that its high expression was positively associated with histological grade, lymph node metastasis, TNM stages, and poor prognosis. In vitro, functional experiments showed that silencing hsa_circ_0005230 significantly decreased GC cell proliferation, invasion and migration capabilities. In addition, the major proteins of EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) relevance have changed. In mechanism studies, bioinformatics analyses were used to predict the hsa_circ_0005230\/miR-1299\/RHOT1 axis and hsa_circ_0005230 may serve as a sponge for miR-1299 and indirectly regulate the expression of RHOT1. The regulated relationships between the molecules on the axis were verified using qRT-PCR and correlation analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay has been used to verify the binding site between miR-1299 and RHOT1. WB (Western blotting) and IHC (Immunohistochemical) were used to verify that RHOT1 may play the role of oncoprotein and affect the biological behavior of GC. Overall, hsa_circ_0005230 could enhance the EMT phenotype by promoting RHOT1 expression through sponging miR-1299, thus affecting the biological behavior of GC.

Expression detection for circ_0020123, microRNA-140-3p (miR-140-3p) and homeobox B5 (HOXB5) was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DDP and cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Colony formation ability was assessed using colony formation assay. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated via transwell assay. Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Protein analysis was conducted by Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to affirm target interaction. Circ_0020123 expression was upregulated in DDP-resistant NSCLC cells. DDP resistance was reduced by downregulation of circ_0020123 in NSCLC cells. Circ_0020123 was identified as a miR-140-3p sponge. The effect of si-circ_0020123 on DDP resistance was partly associated with miR-140-3p upregulation. HOXB5 was a downstream target for miR-140-3p. Overexpression of HOXB5 mitigated miR-140-3p-induced inhibition of DDP resistance in NSCLC cells. Circ_0020123 upregulated the level of HOXB5 partly via sponging miR-140-3p. Also, circ_0020123 promoted tumor growth in NSCLC\/DDP xenografts by regulating miR-140-3p and HOXB5 levels at least in part. These results revealed that circ_0020123 promoted DDP resistance in NSCLC cells partly by targeting miR-140-3p\/HOXB5 axis, indicating that circ_0020123 might be used as a molecular target in DDP treatment for NSCLC.","495":"Cerebrovascular disease, an important cause of acute ischemic stroke, has attracted worldwide attention. Oxycodone has been widely used to treat various painful disorders. This study was designed to explore the mechanism of oxycodone in oxygen-glucose deprivation\/reoxygenation (OGD\/R)-induced brain microvascular endothelial cell model. For the reliability of the results in the following experiments, the viability was firstly detected using CCK-8. With the application of LDH, TEER and TUNEL assays, the LDH expression, permeability and apoptosis of brain microvascular endothelial cells were detected, respectively. Besides, the mRNA and protein expressions of tight junction proteins and RhoA were measured using RT-qPCR and Western blot. Moreover, RT-qPCR was employed to evaluate the expressions of inflammatory cytokines. Western blot was adopted to measure the levels of RhoA, ROCK, MLC2 and apoptosis-related proteins. The results revealed that oxycodone attenuated permeability damage, inflammatory factor release and apoptosis of OGD\/R-induced brain microvascular endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. It was also found that oxycodone could reduce the expressions of RhoA, ROCK and MLC2 in brain microvascular endothelial cells induced by OGD\/R. More importantly, oxycodone exhibited desirable effects on OGD\/R-induced brain microvascular endothelial cells through RhoA\/ROCK\/MLC2 signal.

With in vitro models, this study found that miR-363-3p was markedly under-expressed in CRC tissues and cells, and its overexpression suppressed the viability, migration, and invasion of CRC cells, and promoted cell apoptosis, whereas inhibiting miR-363-3p expression exhibited an opposite role. Additionally, aurora kinase A (AURKA), capable of counteracting the impacts of miR-363-3p on malignant biological behaviors of CRC cells, was identified as a direct target of miR-363-3p. Besides, miR-363-3p was sponged by long non-coding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5), which suppressed miR-363-3p expression.

We used bioinformatics to predict the possible role of METTL5 and molecular biology methods to analyze METTL5 expression. We observed UCEC proliferation, development, and apoptosis using a METTL5 knockdown lentivirus and, coupled with METTL5 bioinformatics and Western blot analysis, detected microsatellite instability (MSI) and MMR. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed. Finally, some METTL5-associated gene mutations in UCECs were detected. Results show that METTL5 expression in UCEC tumor tissue was increased, and UCEC patients with high METTL5 expression had worse prognostic outcomes. We also observed the highest METTL5 expression level in KLE cells. Furthermore, knocking down METTL5 weakened the proliferation, reduced tumor volume and biomarkers, and increased apoptosis. Moreover, METTL5 knockdown induced the MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 expression in MMR. METTL5 was negatively correlated with gene silencing, mRNA binding, olfactory receptor activity, antigen processing and presentation, cytosolic DNA sensing, olfactory transduction, and RIG-1-like and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. METTL5 may regulate MMR protein levels in UCECs, thus enhancing UCEC proliferation, development, and prognosis.","500":"Clinically, the effective treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is very limited. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the mechanism how astragalus polysaccharide (APS) exerts protective effect against AIS and provide a new method for the treatment of AIS. Cell surface antigen flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to identify M1 and M2 microglia. Western blot was used to evaluate the expression of associated protein. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was used to simulate the effect of AIS on rat microglia. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established to simulate the effect of AIS in vivo. Evans blue dye (EBD) was used to evaluate the permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB). Western blot and cell surface antigen flow cytometry results showed that APS promoted the M2 polarization of rat microglia by inhibiting the expression of purinergic receptor (P2X7R). APS reversed the effect of OGD on the polarization of rat microglia M1\/ M2 by regulating P2X7R. APS reversed the effect of MCAO on the polarization of rat microglia M1\/ M2 in vivo. Furthermore, APS inhibited the expression of P2X7R by promoting the degradation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the cerebral cortex of MCAO rats. In addition, APS contributed to maintain the integrity of BBB. Summarily, APS can reduce brain injury by promoting the degradation of ATP in microglia and inhibiting the expression of P2X7R after AIS.","501":"Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the most common gynecological tumors worldwide. Several studies have reported that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in various types of diseases, including cancer.

Dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays were performed to verify the binding region between circRNA_0000285 and miR-654-3p. The expression levels of circRNA_0000285 and miR-654-3p were analyzed in CC and the corresponding normal tissues, as well as in SiHa, HeLa, and NC104 cells using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In addition, the effect of circRNA_0000285 inhibition on cell viability, apoptosis, and the expression of apoptosis-related markers was assessed using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), flow cytometry, and Western blotting assays, respectively. The results verified that miR-654-3p directly targeted circRNA_0000285 expression. circRNA_0000285 was overexpressed and miR-654-3p expression was downregulated in CC tissues and cells compared to that in control. Moreover, circRNA_0000285 knockdown suppressed the viability and promoted the apoptosis of CC cells, which was accompanied by the downregulated and upregulated expressions B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X (Bax), respectively. The ratio of Bax\/Bcl-2 levels also increased following circRNA_0000285 knockdown. However, these findings were abrogated after miR-654-3p inhibitor treatment. Hence, circRNA_0000285 knockdown suppressed cell viability and promoted apoptosis by targeting miR-654-3p in CC.","502":"RAB27B is a member of Ras-like small GTPases that plays a role in endocytosis, exocytosis, and vesicle trafficking.

We demonstrated that ZNF677 is hypermethylated in ccRCC and is associated with clinicopathological features. The results of the functional assays indicate that ZNF677 inhibits tumor cell proliferation and invasion and induces apoptosis. Further prognostic analysis indicated that low expression of ZNF677 is associated with shorter overall survival. Additionally, ZNF677 overexpression suppressed the invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of 786-0 cells by inactivating the PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway.

The result of ROC curve indicated that OSER1-AS1 could be a diagnostic biomarker for RA patients. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay (CCK-8), EdU staining and flow cytometry were performed to explore the effect of OSER1-AS1 on RA-FLSs in vitro. Relative levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinases-3 (MMP-3) were detected by ELISA and the result displayed that overexpression of OSER1-AS1 inhibited RA-induced inflammatory production of IL-1, IL-6 and MMP3. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation assays (RIP) and RNA pull-down assay were conducted to confirm the binding between microRNA-1298-5p (miR-1298-5p) and OSER1-AS1 or E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1). Mechanistically, OSER1-AS1 serves as a competing endogenous (ceRNA) in RA-FLSs through the sponge of miR-1298-5p and increase in the expression of E2F1. Further restoration experiments revealed that miR-1298-5p mimics and E2F1 silencing could partially reverse the inhibiting effect of OSER1-AS1 overexpression on propagation and apoptosis in RA-FLSs.

The GEPIA and ENCORI databases were used to analyze differences in lncRNA FAM83A-AS1 levels within LUAD samples. FAM83A-AS1 and miR-141-3p levels were assessed using qRT-PCR among 30 LUAD samples and surrounding normal tissues. In addition, we analyzed how FAM83A-AS1 affected proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT processes of LUAD cells by targeting miR-141-3p through EdU, CCK-8 assay, scratch assay, transwell migration and invasion assay, immunofluorescence (IF) staining and WB assay. MicroRNAs targeting FAM83A-AS1 were screened using AnnoLnc2 and identified by RT-qPCR. Dual-luciferase assays were utilized to evaluate the connection between FAM83A-AS1 and miR-141-3p. FAM83A-AS1 expression was remarkably raised in lung cancer cells and tissue samples; however, miR-141-3p level markedly reduced relative to healthy samples. FAM83A-AS1 silencing suppressed EMT, growth, invasion and migration of LUAD cells. MiR-141-3p was the possible FAM83A-AS1 binding target negatively associated with FAM83A-AS1. The miR-141-3p inhibitor partly abolished the FAM83A-AS1 knockdown-induced inhibition on EMT, cell growth, invasion and migration in LUAD cells. In addition, miR-141-3p down-regulation abolished the inhibition of E-box-bound zinc finger protein 1 and 2 protein production following FAM83A-AS1 knockdown. According to our results, FAM83A-AS1\/miR-141-3p axis plays an important role in LUAD occurrence and development.

Cr (VI) pollution has become one of the world's most serious environmental concerns due to its long persistence in the environment and highly deadly nature in living organisms. To its widespread use in industries Cr (VI) is highly toxic and one of the most common environmental contaminants. Cr (VI) is frequently non-biodegradable in nature, which means it stays in the environment for a long time, pollutes the soil and water, and poses substantial health risks to humans and wildlife. In living things, the hexavalent form of Cr is carcinogenic, genotoxic, and mutagenic. Physico-chemical techniques currently used for Cr (VI) removal are not environmentally friendly and use a large number of chemicals. Microbes have many natural or acquired mechanisms to combat chromium toxicity, such as biosorption, reduction, subsequent efflux, or bioaccumulation.

Nevertheless, its biological role in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains unclear. The RPN2 expression levels in LSCC tissues and cell lines (AMC-HN-8 and TU212) were measured using real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, or Western blot. The influences of RPN2 on the proliferation, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and aerobic glycolysis of LSCC cells were investigated after upregulation or downregulation of RPN2 in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, we assessed the impact of RPN2 on the reactive oxygen species (ROS)\/Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI3K)\/Protein Kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. We found that compared with the control, RPN2 was highly expressed in LSCC tissues and cells. Overexpression of RPN2 elevated the proliferation, migration, glucose uptake, lactate production release, and levels of Vimentin, hexokinase-2 (HK-2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and ROS, but inhibited E-cadherin expression in AMC-HN-8 cells. Knockdown of RPN2 in TU212 cells showed opposite effects on the above indexes. Meanwhile, RPN2 upregulation increased the levels of p-PI3K\/PI3K and p-Akt\/Akt, which were attenuated by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS inhibitor. Both NAC and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could reverse the effects of RPN2 overexpression on the malignant phenotypes of LSCC cells. In xenografted mice, silencing RPN2 expression reduced tumor growth, ROS production, and levels of Ki-67, Vimentin, LDHA, and p-Akt\/Akt, but enhanced E-cadherin expression. In conclusion, our data suggested that RPN2 promoted the proliferation, migration, EMT, and glycolysis of LSCC via modulating ROS-mediated PI3K\/Akt activation.","516":null,"517":"Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) remains incurable and fatal.

Furthermore, potential lncRNA TRPM2-AS targeting miRNAs were predicted by public databases. The expression of five selected miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. We found that lncRNA TRPM2-AS expression was increased in EC tissues and cell lines compared with respective control. Silencing lncRNA TRPM2-AS suppressed EC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoted cell apoptosis. Moreover, lncRNA TRPM2-AS knockdown reduced neural cadherin, vimentin, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 gene and protein expressions while increased epithelial cadherin expression. Furthermore, lncRNA TRPM2-AS knockdown promoted microRNA (miR)-1291, miR-6852-5p, and miR-138-5p expressions. Taken together, this study for the first time demonstrates that upregulation of lncRNA TRPM2-AS in EC promotes the growth and metastasis of EC likely through interacting with miR-1291, miR-6852-5p, and miR-138-5p.","529":null,"530":"This study aimed to explore the role of circular-CDC like kinase 1 (circ-CLK1) in the pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Circ-CLK1 expression levels were detected via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The effects of circ-CLK1 knockdown on the viability and apoptosis of OSCC cells were determined using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, EdU staining, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. StarBase and TargetScan were used to predict targeting relationships, which were then confirmed by the dual luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay. We found that the expression of circ-CLK1 was significantly higher in OSCC patients and cell lines. Inhibition of circ-CLK1 reduced the viability and proliferation of OSCC cells while enhancing their apoptosis. However, inhibiting miR-18b-5p or overexpression of Y-box protein 2 (YBX2) can reverse the effect of circ-CLK1 knockdown on OSCC cells. Therefore, circ-CLK1 inhibited the apoptosis of OSCC cells through the miR-18b-5p\/YBX2 axis, and these findings suggest that circ-CLK1 could be a potential therapeutic target for OSCC patients.","531":null,"532":"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant tumor that occurs in children and adolescents. Previous studies reported a low expression of miR-148b-3p in OS, but its biological function in OS remains obscure. This study aimed to explore the role of miR-148b-3p in OS progression. Herein, the expression of miR-148b-3p and son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) both in OS tissues and cells were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting assay. miR-148b-3p mimic or inhibitor, pcDH-SOS1 plasmid or si-SOS1 and agomir-miR-148b-3p were constructed for cell transfection. In vitro, the biological effect of miR-148b-3p was determined employing MTT, EdU, colony formation, flow cytometry, transwell and wound healing assay, separately. The target relationship between SOS1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and miR-148b-3p was analyzed using dual-luciferase reporter gene. In vivo, the inhibition of agomir-miR-148b-3p in mice was evaluated via a xenograft mouse model. miR-148b-3p was noticeably low-expressed in OS tissues and cells, and miR-148b-3p over-expression in OS cells suppressed the growth, migration and invasion, induced apoptosis. The effect of miR-148b-3p-inhibitor on cell biological behavior is opposite to that of miR-148b-3p over-expression. Conversely, The expression of SOS1 was significant higher in OS tissues and cells, miR-148b-3p targeted and was negatively associated with the expression level of SOS1. In addition, the anti-tumor effect of miR-148b-3p was reversed by SOS1. Importantly, we demonstrated that the tumor growth of stably over-expressed miR-148b-3p human MG-63 cells was obviously reduced in tumor-bearing mice. These data highlighted that miR-148b-3p might be as a promising therapeutic target for OS.","533":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 gene (PVT1) is related to the progress of various cancers. Here, we illuminated the role of PVT1 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell proliferation and apoptosis. PVT1 was upregulated in plasma samples from patients with ALL and ALL cell lines. PVT1 silencing repressed cell viability and enhanced cell apoptosis in Jurkat and SUP-B15 cells. PVT1 targeted microRNA-486-5p (miR-486-5p) and negatively modulated miR-486-5p expression. Upregulation of miR-486-5p decreased cell viability and increased ALL cell apoptosis. Mastermind Like Transcriptional Coactivator 3 (MAML3) was a downstream molecule of miR-486-5p and miR-486-5p mimic transfection weakened its expression in ALL cells. Rescue experiments proved that reintroduction of PVT1 counteracted the impacts of miR-486-5p in ALL cell proliferation and apoptosis. In vivo, PVT1 silencing repressed the tumor growth of SUP-B15 cells and reduced the expression of MAML3. Altogether, silencing of PVT1 inhibited ALL cell growth and induced cell apoptosis through sponging miR-486-5p.","534":"Increasing evidence has shown that traditional Chinese medicines and their bioactive components exert an anti-tumor effect, representing a novel treatment strategy. Actinidia chinensis Planch Root extracts (acRoots) have been reported to repress cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. The effect of acRoots on hypopharyngeal carcinoma progression was explored in this study. Firstly, data from MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and colony formation assays showed that incubation with accRoots reduced cell proliferation of hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Moreover, acRoots promoted the cell apoptosis of hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Secondly, cell migration and invasion of hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells were suppressed by acRoots. Thirdly, E2F1 (E2F Transcription Factor 1) and lncRNA MNX1-AS1 (MNX1 antisense RNA 1) were up-regulated in hypopharyngeal carcinoma tissues, and reduced in hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells post acRoots incubation. Overexpression of E2F1 attenuated acRoots-induced decrease in MNX1-AS1 in hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Lastly, administration with acRoots retarded in vivo hypopharyngeal carcinoma growth through down-regulation of E2F1-mediated MNX1-AS1.

Recently, more and more studies indicated that circRNA could function as a tumor activator or suppressor in cervical cell development. Therefore, we aimed to study the effect of circRNA CDK6 (circCDK6) on the development and biological behavior of cervical cancer. We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine the circCDK6 expression level in cervical cancer cell lines. RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the location of circCDK6 and miR-449a in HeLa and CaSki cells, respectively. Then, the biological function of silencing circCDK6 in cellular proliferation, metastasis, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-related process was determined. We also performed RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) and Dual-luciferase reporter assay to determine the relationship between the circCDK6 and miR-449a. Finally, the results showed that circCDK6 level remarkably increased in several cervical cancer cells, especially in Hela and CaSki cells. The miR-449a was further confirmed to be a potential target of circCDK6, and its expression increased by silencing circCDK6. The circCDK6 participated in tumorigenesis and cancer progression and might serve as a tumor suppressive factor in cervical cell progression via Epithelial-MesenchymalTransition (EMT) process by regulating miR-449a.","537":"The regulatory network of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) exists widely in tumors and affects the expression of cancer-related genes, thus playing an important role in the development and prognosis of human tumors. In this research, we explored the role and mechanism of LINC00665 as a ceRNA in breast cancer. We analyzed the expression and targets of LINC00665 in breast cancer using bioinformatics, and detected their effects on breast cancer cells by CCK8, transwell, colony formation and flow cytometry assays. From our results, LINC00665 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion and induced the apoptosis through inactivating the AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. LINC00665 had five potential downstream target miRNAs (miR-542-3p, miR-624-5p, miR-641, miR-425-5p, and miR-30-3p). In dual-luciferase report gene assay, the fluorescence activity of cells transfected with miR-641 mimics decreased, and the expression of miR-641 decreased significantly after knocking down LINC00665. miR-641 mimics significantly inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. We detected five potential direct targets of miR-641 using qPCR (SRCAP, SIKE1, NADK, KHDC4, and HSPG2). SRCAP expression decreased significantly in miR-641 overexpression cells and the binding of SRCAP's 3'UTR and miR-641 was further confirmed by dual-luciferase report gene assay. SRCAP blocked the proliferation and invasion inhibition induced by miR-641 or si-LINC00665 in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, LINC00665 could promote the survival and metastasis of breast cancer cells through sponging miR-641 and targeting SRCAP.

Macrophages are a major type of cells to response inflammation caused by different type of factors by polarized into specific phenotypes. Luteolin and glycyrrhizic acid exert protect role in asthma; however, their role in THP-1 derived macrophages polarization whether through regulating the expression of hsa_circ_0001326 is still unknown. The effect of luteolin and glycyrrhizic acid on THP-1 derived macrophages polarization were evaluated using qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA assay. The function of hsa_circ_0001326 on macrophages polarization in luteolin treated THP-1 derived macrophages were assessed after silence of hsa_circ_0001326. And the expression of its' potential downstream gene, including hsa-miR-136-5p and ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4), were detected using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the potential mechanism of hsa_circ_0001326 were validated using rescue experiment. Results showed that luteolin promoted M2 polarization and inhibited M1 polarization in THP-1 induced macrophages, but glycyrrhizic acid had no these effects. Hsa_circ_0001326 expression was upregulated in luteolin treat THP-1 derived macrophages. Silence of hsa_circ_0001326 reversed the function of luteolin on macrophages polarization. In addition, hsa_circ_0001326 attenuated the inhibition effect of luteolin on hsa-miR-136-5p expression, and the promotion effect on USP4 expression. Furthermore, hsa-miR-136-5p inhibitor reversed the effect of hsa_circ_0001326 on macrophages polarization and the USP4 expression. Taken together, luteolin activates M2 macrophages and suppresses M1 macrophages by upregulation of hsa_circ_0001326. Further mechanism maybe by regulating hsa_circ_0001326 downstream gene expression, including hsa-miR-136-5p and USP4, in THP-1 derived macrophages.

Although UA is only a product of metabolism, it is important biological regulator. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has important biological functions. However, so far, the effect of UA on EGF's activity has not been revealed. For this, in the current study, we systematically studied the effect of OA on the biological activity of EGF. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were used as an in vitro model, and Western-blot, RT-PCR, laser scanning confocal microscopy (CLSM) and co-localization analyses were carried out. The results showed that high concentration of UA (10 mg\/dl) severely affected the biological activity of EGF. High concentration of UA suppressed the activity of EGF, and inhibited the biological effect of EGF on the HUVECs. However, it is interesting that EGF-mediated intracellular signaling was significantly down-regulated in the H2O2-induced senescent HUVEC, and physiological concentration of UA could at least partially restore the EGF-mediated signaling. Further work showed that physiological concentration of UA (5 mg\/dl) shows the anti-aging effect. Taken together, current research indicates that UA may be a 'double-edged sword', physiological concentration of UA may be beneficial, but high concentrations of uric acid (UA) are harmful.","541":null,"542":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been extensively studied in various diseases, including sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). This research intended to elucidate the mechanism of circular RNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3) in sepsis-engendered AKI. Human tubule epithelial cells (HK2) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish a septic AKI cell model. The gene expression levels were evaluated by RT-qPCR. Cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution were assessed through CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays. The potential interactions between genes were verified by luciferase reporter and RIP assays. The results displayed that circHIPK3 expression was enhanced in septic AKI patients and LPS-triggered HK2 cells. Moreover, circHIPK3 interference expedited HK2 cell viability and attenuated apoptosis, inflammatory and oxidative damages following LPS stimulation. Furthermore, circHIPK3 functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-338, and forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) was negatively regulated by miR-338. CircHIPK3 aggravated cell injury in LPS-treated HK2 via targeting miR-338, and FOXA1 addition overturned the suppressing impacts of miR-338-3p augmentation on LPS-activated HK2 cell damage. Finally, we demonstrated that circHIPK3 modulated LPS-induced cell damage via the miR-338\/FOXA1 axis. In sum, our results elaborated that circHIPK3 knockdown attenuated LPS-triggered HK2 cell injury by regulating FOXA1 expression via interacting with miR-338, suggesting that circHIPK3 might be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for sepsis-induced AKI patients.","543":null,"544":null,"545":"LncRNA down syndrome cell adhesion molecule antisense 1 (DSCAM-AS1) plays an important role in tumor progression, but its function in pancreatic cancer is unknown.

DSCAM-AS1 was knocked down in pancreatic cancer cells, and its impacts on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were detected. The binding relationship among DSCAM-AS1, miR-136-5p, and pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3) was investigated by bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assay. An in vivo animal model was constructed to determine the role of DSCAM-AS1 in tumor growth. Our results showed that DSCAM-AS1 was elevated in tumor tissues of pancreatic cancer patients and cell lines. DSCAM-AS1 knockdown efficiently inhibited PANC-1 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and suppressed tumor growth. DSCAM-AS1 could promote PBX3 expression by sponging miR-136-5p, and its function in pancreatic cancer was partially mediated by the miR-136-5p\/PBX3 axis.

However, the effect of metformin on islet microcirculation remains unclear. In the present study, to explore the effect of metformin on islet endothelial cells and investigated the underlying mechanism, we assessed the effects of metformin on islet endothelial cell survival, proliferation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our results suggest that metformin stimulates the proliferation of pancreatic islet endothelial cells and inhibits the apoptosis and oxidative stress caused by high glucose levels. By activating farnesoid X receptor (FXR), metformin increases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), improves the production of nitric oxide (NO) and decreases the production of ROS. After the inhibition of FXR or VEGF-A, all of the effects disappeared. Thus, metformin appears to regulate islet microvascular endothelial cell (IMEC) proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative stress by activating the FXR\/VEGF-A\/eNOS pathway. These findings provide a new mechanism underlying the islet-protective effect of metformin.","549":"The expression of METTL14 is significantly reduced in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). To clarify the significance of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification in RP, we examined phagocytosis, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution in a human RPE cell line, ARPE-19, following lentivirus-mediated knockdown of METTL14. Differentially expressed genes and changes in m6A level were evaluated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq), respectively. The results showed that phagocytosis and proliferation were decreased whereas apoptosis was increased in RPE cells by METTL14 silencing. We found that METTL14 directly regulated m6A level and the expression of MAP2, as determined by RNA-seq, MeRIP-seq, MeRIP quantitative PCR, and the RNA pull-down assay. Additionally, MAP2 could bind to neuronal differentiation (NEUROD)1, a pathogenic gene in RPE-associated diseases. A family member of the YTH domain, (YTHDF)2 was recognized as an m6A reader of MAP2 mRNA. MAP2 overexpression had the same effects as METTL14 knockdown in RPE cells. Thus, METTL14 regulates the expression of MAP2 via the modification of m6A, resulting in the dysregulation of NEUROD1 and pathologic changes in RPE cells. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting the m6A modification of MAP2 or the METTL14\/YTHDF2\/MAP2\/NEUROD1 signaling axis may be effective in the treatment of RPE-associated ocular diseases.","550":"Sustained cardiac hypertrophy (CH) contributes to many heart diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) collectively play critical roles in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the roles of lncRNA H19 in CH are still unclear. A CH model was constructed utilizing isoproterenol (ISO). We demonstrated H19 could participate in regulating ISO-induced CH development both in vivo and in vitro. The online databases DIANA and TargetScan were used to predict the targets of H19 and MicroRNA-145-3p (miR-145-3p), respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the downstream targets. The results showed that H19 was decreased under ISO stimulation. The H19 overexpression resulted in significant decrease in mouse heart size and weight, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular posterior wall thickness and cardiac hypertrophic growth, while promoted the increase of left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricle fraction shortening. H19 also inhibited protein expression levels of CH markers, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and MYH7. Luciferase assays results showed that miR-145-3p was a target of H19 and SMAD4 was a target of miR-145-3p. We found that H19 regulated SMAD4 by sponging miR-145-3p. Knockout of miR-145-3p or overexpression of SMAD4 facilitated H19-induced decreases in ANP, BNP, and MYH7.

The expression of SPAG5 in malignant melanoma (MM) tissues and matched normal tissues was detected using qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Cell viability was tested using CCK-8 (Cell Count Kit-8), colony formation and EdU staining. Cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured using transwell chambers and immunofluorescent staining. Cell cycle distribution and tumorigenesis were assessed by flow cytometry and in vivo tumor-bearing experiments, respectively. The results demonstrated that the expression of SPAG5 was increased in MM tissues and cells. Downregulation of SPAG5 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion and EMT, and induced a G1-phase arrest. In addition, downregulation of SPAG5 decreased the expression of FOXM1, thereafter inhibiting the expression of ADAM17, NOTCH1 and HES1. Furthermore, deletion of SPAG5 expression decreased the tumorigenesis of MM A375 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SPAG5 was overexpressed in MM.

A total of 56 VS samples and 42 normal vestibular nerve (VN) samples were included in this study. The expression of BRCAT54 and miR-21 in these samples were analyzed with RT-qPCR. Subcellular location of BRCAT54 in primary VS cells was analyzed by subcellular fractionation assay. The direct interaction between BRCAT54 and miR-21 was analyzed through RNA pull-down assay. Overexpression assay was performed to explore the interaction between BRCAT54 and miR-21. The role of BRCAT54 and miR-21 in primary VS cell proliferation was analyzed using BrdU assay. We found that BRCAT54 was downregulated in VS samples than that in VN samples, while miR-21 was upregulated in VS samples. BRCAT54 and miR-21 were not closely correlated. BRCAT54 was detected in both nuclear and cytoplasm samples, and BRCAT54 directly interacted with miR-21. However, BRCAT54 and miR-21 did not affect the expression of each other.

Western blot and immunochemistry assays were carried out to explore the level of RBPMS2. GC malignancy behaviors were determined by cell counting kit-8, Transwell, flow cytometry analysis and terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling staining. The inflammatory cell infiltration in xenograft model was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. CpG Islands was predicted by MethPrimer and the DNA methylation of RBPMS2 was evaluated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that RBPMS2 was downregulated in GC specimens. Poor survival rates were associated with low RBPMS2 expression. Overexpression of RBPMS2 inhibited GC growth while facilitated apoptosis in GC cells. In addition, level of DNA methylation of RBPMS2 in GC tissues was increased and DNA methylation of RBPMS2 was strongly associated with tumor invasion, Borrmann classification and TNM stage. We also observed that DNA methylation inhibitors counteracted the role of RBPMS2 in restraining GC development and tumorigenesis.

Rat adrenal gland pheochromocytoma cell line PC-12 were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic the in vitro environment of SCI. A rat mode of SCI was established by laminectomy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured by 2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining assay. Western blot was conducted to evaluate the expression levels of apoptotic indexes and proinflammatory cytokines. The interaction between miR-99a and NOX4 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression level of miR-99a was reduced while NOX4 expression was upregulated in cerebrospinal fluid of SCI patients and LPS-treated PC-12 cells. LPS impeded cell viability and promoted inflammation, apoptosis and ROS levels of PC-12 cells. Overexpression of miR-99a significantly promoted cell viability and reduced inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress in LPS-stimulated PC-12 cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays verified that NOX4 was a target of miR-99a. Moreover, the expression of NOX4 was reduced in PC-12 cells after transfection with miR-99a mimic. Overexpression of NOX4 partly abolished the protective effect of miR-99a in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.

In this study, the detection of circ-ZNF609 and miR-514a-5p expressions was carried out by qRT-PCR in TC cell lines. Cell proliferation assessment is employed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation, Western blot and immunofluorescence. Cell invasion and migration measurement were conducted applying wound healing and transwell. The relationship between circ-ZNF609 and miR-514a-5p was subjected to prediction with bioinformatics analysis and validated with the aid of luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, xenograft animal experiment was adopted to confirm the role of circ-ZNF609\/miR-514a-5p in TC in vivo. The data indicated that circ-ZNF609 was highly expressed, while miR-514a-5p was downregulated in TC cells. Circ-ZNF609 knockdown prevented the malignant biological behaviors of TPC-1 and IHH-4 cells. Besides, circ-ZNF609 sponged miR-514a-5p and miR-514a-5p knockdown reversed the suppressed impacts of circ-ZNF609 knockdown on TC cell malignant biological behaviors. In addition, the silence of circ-ZNF6091 significantly repressed, whereas miR-514a-5p silencing promoted TC tumorigenesis in vivo.

Unfortunately, the molecular functions involved in this action still have little overlap. Therefore, this study aimed to identify a novel circCAMSAP1 role in NSCLC. Overexpression of circCAMSAP1 has been demonstrated in NSCLC lung tissues and cell lines. Sequencing and RNase R experiments were planned to determine whether circCAMSAP1 is looped and exists in NSCLC. We also found that downregulated circCAMSAP1 repressed cell proliferation and increased apoptosis of NSCLC cells in vitro and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, a luciferase assay revealed that circCAMSAP1 could regulate baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) repeat containing 5 (BIRC5, also known as survivin) expression by directly binding to miR-1182. However, BIRC5 without 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) could reverse the influence of downregulated circCAMSAP1 on proliferation and apoptosis in NSCLC.

Due to the damage of bone healing ability, the bone repair of osteoporotic patients is usually slow. Here we aimed to explore the function and potential molecular mechanism of miR-100 in osteogenic differentiation ability of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). Ovariectomy was performed on mice to induce osteoporosis. BMSCs were extracted from normal and ovariectomized (OVX) mice to examine the effect of microRNA (miR)-100 on BMSC osteogenic differentiation. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and safranin O-fast green staining assays were performed on femur tissues to reveal pathological changes. The osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs were determined by Alkaline Phosphatase and Alizarin red staining assays. The results showed that miR-100 expression was significantly upregulated in bone tissues and BMSCs from osteoporotic mice. MiR-100 knockdown partially improved osteogenic function of OVX mice-derived BMSCs. Next, mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (MTOR) was identified as the target downstream miR-100. MiR-100 deficiency can activate the protein kinase B (AKT)\/mTOR pathway. MiR-100 controlled the osteogenic function of BMSCs by the AKT\/mTOR pathway. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that inhibition of miR-100 facilitates bone regeneration defects of BMSCs in osteoporotic mice through AKT pathway, indicating that miR-100 might be an effective target for the treatment of osteoporotic mandibular injury and bone defect diseases.","568":null,"569":"Circular RNAs are novel regulators in endometrial carcinoma. Hsa_circ_0039569 was reportedly upregulated in endometrial carcinoma; however, the functional roles and mechanisms of hsa_circ_0039569 need further investigation. Therefore, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine the mRNA levels of hsa_circ_0039569, miR-197 and high mobility group protein A1 (HMGA1). The protein level of HMGA1 was determined by Western blot. Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays were used to assess cell proliferation. Cell migration was measured via wound healing and Transwell assays. Transwell assay was also performed to determine cell invasion ability. Direct binding of the indicated molecules were verified by RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and dual luciferase reporter assay. The results revealed that hsa_circ_0039569 and HMGA1 were elevated, while miR-197 was downregulated in endometrial carcinoma. Moreover, hsa_circ_0039569 was positively correlated with the expression of HMGA1 and was negatively correlated with the level of miR-197. In addition, hsa_circ_0039569 facilitated the proliferation, migration and invasion of endometrial carcinoma cells. The underlying mechanism is that hsa_circ_0039569 serves as a sponge of miR-197 to repress the inhibitory effect of miR-197 on HMGA1. Furthermore, the miR-197\/HMGA1 axis was implicated in endometrial carcinoma progression accelerated by hsa_circ_0039569. Collectively, hsa_circ_0039569 may promote the development of endometrial carcinoma by serving as an endogenous sponge of miR-197, increasing HMGA1 expression and identifying a novel target for endometrial carcinoma treatment.","570":"CC: Closeness centrality; OS: Osteosarcoma; TCM: Traditional Chinese medicine; NSCLC: Non-small cell lung cancer; DC: Degree centrality; CHM: Chinese herb medicine; BC: Betweenness centrality.","571":null,"572":null,"573":null,"574":null,"575":null,"576":null,"577":null,"578":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a critical role in acute cerebral infarction (ACI). Our research discussed the effect of circ-Carm1 in ACI and its potential molecular mechanisms. Healthy controls and patients with ACI were included in this study. The establishment of an oxygen and glucose deprivation\/reoxygenation (OGD\/R) model of HT22 cells was conducted to mimic ACI in vitro. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was conducted to determine mRNA levels extracted from serum and HT22 cell samples, and Western blotting was performed to determine protein levels. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and cell counting kit 8 assays were conducted to evaluate cellular functions. Concentrations of Fe2+ and malondialdehyde, and levels of transferrin receptor 1, glutathione peroxidase 4, and glutathione were evaluated to determine ferroptosis in OGD\/R-induced HT22 cells. The binding relationships between mRNAs and miRNAs were verified. circ-Carm1 was highly expressed in OGD\/R-treated HT22 cells. Deficiency of circ-Carm1 restored cell viability and suppressed ferroptosis in OGD\/R-induced HT22 cells. miR-3098-3p was predicted to be a target of circ-Carm1. The miR-3098-3p inhibitor partly neutralized the functions of circ-Carm1 in OGD\/R-induced HT22 cells. Furthermore, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) was confirmed to be a downstream target of miR-3098-3p and was elevated in OGD\/R-induced HT22 cells. Overexpression of ACSL4 mitigated the functions of miR-3098-3p and accelerated HT22 cell dysfunction. Hence, circ-Carm1 is upregulated in ACI. circ-Carm1 suppression protects HT22 cells from dysfunction by inhibiting ferroptosis. Therefore, inducing circ-Carm1 deficiency may be a promising therapeutic method for ACI.","579":"CircRNAs (circular RNAs) have been implicated in the development and progression of a variety of cancers. The molecular pathways underlying the progression of NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) and the associated regulation of circRNAs in NSCLC remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that circPLK1 expression was upregulated in serum exosomes and tissues from NSCLC patients. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that a high expression level of circPLK1 was associated with a poorer prognosis in NSCLC patients. Exosomes extracted from NSCLC serum could promote the replication, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells and suppress apoptotic cell death. The overexpression of circPLK1 also promotes the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells. Molecular analyses demonstrated that circPLK1 directly targets miR-1294 and negatively regulates its activity. And circPLK1 overexpression facilitates the progression of NSCLC by negatively regulating miR-1294 level and maintaining a high-level expression of HMGA1 (High Mobility Group Protein A1). Our study suggests that circPLK1 upregulation plays an important role in NSCLC progression by targeting miR-1294\/HMGA1 axis. These data provide a theoretical basis for the development of therapeutic strategy targeting exosomal circPLK1 in NSCLC treatment.","580":"Circular RNA circ_UBAP2 has been reported to be closely associated with various tumors. The present work focused on exploring the roles of circ_UBAP2 and its molecular mechanism in osteosarcoma (OS). Circ_UBAP2, miR-637, and high-mobility group box (HMGB) 2 levels in OS cells and tissues were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The relationship between miR-637 and circ_UBAP2, as well as between miR-637 and HMGB2, was predicted and examined through bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter gene experiments. Moreover, OS cell growth, invasion, migration, and apoptosis were detected using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell and flow cytometry assays, respectively. HMGB2 protein levels were measured using Western blotting. Xenograft tumor formation assay was also performed. Circ_UBAP2 showed high expression levels in OS tissues and cells, which was directly proportional to metastasis and clinical stage of OS. The overexpression of circ_UBAP2 enhanced the growth, invasion, and migration of OS cells, but suppressed their apoptosis. In contrast, circ_UBAP2 silencing had opposite effects. Furthermore, miR-637 served as a downstream target of circ_UBAP2, which played opposite roles to circ_UBAP2 in OS. More importantly, HMGB2 served as miR-637's downstream target. The xenograft experiments in nude mice also proved that knockdown of circ_UBAP2 could increase miR-637 expression, but decrease HMGB2 expression, thus alleviating OS progression. Mechanistically, circ_UBAP2 exerts a cancer-promoting effect on OS by downregulating miR-637 and upregulating the expression of HMGB2. Circ_UBAP2 plays a promoting role in OS, and the circ_UBAP2\/miR-637\/HMGB2 axis is involved in OS progression.","581":null,"582":"The main pathological feature of acute lung injury (ALI) is pulmonary edema caused by increased permeability of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). LPS was has been confirmed to lead to cell damage and barrier dysfunction in PMVECs. Furthermore, receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) was discovered to be increased in LPS-induced human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), but the mechanism of RIP140 on LPS-induced HPMECs has not been investigated. In this study, an acute lung injury model was constructed in LPS-induced HPMECs. After RIP140 was downregulated, inflammation, apoptosis and cell permeability levels were detected by RT-qPCR, TUNEL staining and FITC-Dextran, respectively. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of related factors. The binding of RIP140 and C-terminal binding protein 2 (CTBP2) was predicted by database and verified by Co-IP. Subsequently, CTBP2 overexpression was transfected into cells and the above experiments were performed again. The results showed that inflammation, apoptosis and permeability levels of LPS-induced HPMECs were remarkably increased compared to the untreated control group. However, these levels were suppressed after RIP140 was silenced compared to the LPS-induced HPMECs group. Notably, the Co-IP study demonstrated that RIP140 and CTBP2 interacted with each other. Moreover, CTBP2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of RIP140 silencing on LPS-induced inflammation, apoptosis and permeability levels in HPMECs. Together, the study found that interference of RIP140 could alleviate LPS-induced inflammation, apoptosis and permeability in HPMECs by regulating CTBP2.","583":null,"584":null,"585":null,"586":"The coronary arteries mainly function to perfuse the myocardium. When coronary artery resistance increases, myocardial perfusion decreases and myocardial remodeling occurs. Mitochondrial damage has been regarded as the primary cause of microvascular dysfunction. In the present study, we explored the effects of mitophagy activation on microvascular damage. Hypoxia\/reoxygenation injury induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, thereby promoting mitochondrial dysfunction in endothelial cells. Mitochondrial impairment induced apoptosis, reducing the viability and proliferation of endothelial cells. However, supplementation with the mitophagy inducer urolithin A (UA) preserved mitochondrial function by reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential in endothelial cells. UA also sustained the viability and improved the proliferative capacity of endothelial cells by suppressing apoptotic factors and upregulating cyclins D and E. In addition, UA inhibited mitochondrial fission and restored mitochondrial fusion, which reduced the proportion of fragmented mitochondria within endothelial cells. UA enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells by upregulating sirtuin 3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha. These results suggested that activation of mitophagy may reduce hypoxia\/reoxygenation-induced cardiac microvascular damage by improving mitochondrial quality control and increasing cell viability and proliferation.","587":null,"588":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ZFAS1 (zinc finger antisense 1) was demonstrated to play critical roles in various cancer progression.

Cell proliferation, invasion and migration assays were used to investigate biological behaviors of CC cells related to CC progression. The relationship of KLF6 to ZFAS1 and miR-190a-3p was analyzed by circRIP and luciferase reporter assay. In addition, in vivo experiment was carried out to explore the function of ZFAS1 in tumor growth of CC. The expression levels of ZFAS1 and KLF6 were both significantly elevated, while the expression of miR-190a-3p was inhibited in CC tumor tissues. In addition, ZFAS1 influenced CC tumor growth through miR-190a-3p. KLF6 was a target of miR-190a-3p and inhibited miR-190a-3p-induced CC tumor growth. Furthermore, KLF6 was negatively regulated by miR-190a-3p, but positively regulated by ZFAS1. Overexpression of ZFAS1 and inhibition of miR-190a-3p significantly increased the expression levels of KLF6. Finally, in vitro assays demonstrated that inhibition of ZFAS1 reduced CC tumor growth and the expression levels of KLF6, but increased the expression levels of miR-190a-3p.

The role of GAS5 in the expression and methylation of miR-146a in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) were studied by RT-qPCR and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), respectively. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that GAS5 and miR-146a were downregulated in sepsis-ALI and the expression of these two were correlated. LPS induced the downregulation of GAS5 and miR-146a in HBEpCs. In HBEpCs, overexpression of GAS5 increased the expression levels of miR-146a and reduced the methylation of miR-146a gene. Under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, overexpression of GAS5 and miR-146a decreased the apoptotic rate of HBEpCs. Moreover, the combined overexpression of GAS5 and miR-146a showed stronger effects.

Diagnostic potentials of plasma TSPEAR-AS2 and miR-212-3p were assessed by ROC curve analysis. Normalized expression levels of TSPEAR-AS2 and miR-212-3p were subjected to Pearson's correlation coefficient to evaluate their corrections. TSPEAR-AS2 was significantly downregulated in RA patients, while plasma expression levels of miR-212-3p were significantly increased in RA patients. The expression of TSPEAR-AS2 and miR-212-3p showed promising diagnostic value for RA. Plasma expression levels of TSPEAR-AS2 and miR-212-3p were significantly and inversely correlated in RA patients but not in healthy controls. Besides, overexpression of TSPEAR-AS2 decreased the apoptosis of RA HFLSs, while miR-212-3p increased cell apoptosis. In addition, miR-212-3p attenuated the effects of overexpression of TSPEAR-AS2. Overexpression of TSPEAR-AS2 decreased the expression levels of miR-212-3p in HFLS, while overexpression of miR-212-3p did not affect the expression of TSPEAR-AS2.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully revealed. In this study, we explored the expression profile of Foxhead box D1 (FOXD1), its association with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and its downstream targets in LSCC. Bioinformatic analysis was performed based on the LSCC subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas-Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-HSNC) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq data from Cistrome Data Browser. LSCC cell lines AMC-HN-8 and TU212 were used for in vitro studies. Results showed that FOXD1 upregulation was associated with poor prognosis of LSCC. FOXD1 knockdown reduced N-cadherin and Vimentin expression but increased E-cadherin expression in AMC-HN-8 cells. Its overexpression showed opposite effects in TU212 cells. FOXD1 could bind to the promoter of ZNF532 and activate its transcription. ZNF532 overexpression enhanced the invasion of both AMC-HN-8 and TU212 cells. In comparison, its knockdown significantly impaired their invasion. ZNF532 knockdown nearly abrogated the alterations of EMT markers caused by FOXD1 overexpression. Its overexpression largely rescued the phenotypes caused by FOXD1 knockdown. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that ZNF532 correlated genes are largely enriched in extracellular matrix regulations. LSCC patients with high ZNF532 expression (top 50%) had a significantly worse progression-free survival. In summary, this study confirmed that FOXD1 promotes partial-EMT of LSCC cells via transcriptionally activating the expression of ZNF532.","594":"Tetrandrine (TET) was reported to be an autophagy agonist, and the activating autophagy could delay intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD).

In vitro, cytotoxicity was detected by MTT assay, ROS was measured with DCFH-DA probe, MDA, and SOD content was evaluated through ELISA, NP cell apoptosis was tested by flow cytometry, protein expression was detected by Western blot, in particular, LC3 expression was assessed by immunofluorescence. In vivo, pathological changes were estimated by HE and safranin-O staining, related protein expression was measured by immunohistochemistry, and the apoptosis was detected by TUNEL. Compared with the control group, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation were increased, the expression of cleaved caspase-3,9, aggrecan and collagen II were reduced, and the expression of MMP13 and ADAMTS5 were up-regulated in TBHP-treated NP cells. Moreover, TET could reverse the effect of TBHP on NP cells. Further, TET enhanced autophagy in NP cells by amplifying the LC3 II\/LC3 I\/ratio and reducing p62 expression, which attenuated oxidative stress, apoptosis, and ECM degradation in TBHP-treated NP cells. In addition, in vivo, TET delayed rat IDD, increased the expression of LC3 and collagen II, and weakened apoptosis. TET inhibited oxidative stress, apoptosis, and ECM degradation in TBHP-treated NP cells by inducing autophagy, and alleviated IDD. These indicated that TET might be a potential candidate drug for the treatment of IDD.","595":"It aims to analyze the influential mechanism of microRNA-9 (miR-9) and long non-coding RNA XIST (lncRNA XIST) expression on the proliferation and apoptosis of macrophages induced by oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL).

Methylthiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method, flow cytometry, and Western blot were used to detect and compare the differences of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the expression levels of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) after ox-LDL induction and transfection of miR-9 mimic, miR-9 inhibitor and XIST expression vector, respectively. The results showed that lncRNA XIST overexpression vector was successfully constructed and transfected into cells, wh5ich can inhibit the expression level of miR-9. Compared with the normal control group, ox-LDL can inhibit cell proliferation, promote cell apoptosis, and increase the expression level of target protein. Moreover, transfection of XIST expression vector based on ox-LDL induction can significantly enhance the inhibition of cell proliferation, and promote cell apoptosis and the expression of target protein. Transfection of miR-9 mimic can improve the biological changes induced by ox-LDL. After co-transfection of miR-9 mimic and XIST expression vector based on ox-LDL induction, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and target protein expression level were not significantly different from those induced by ox-LDL alone. In summary, the increased expression level of miR-9 can inhibit the apoptosis of macrophages induced by ox-LDL. lncRNA XIST can positively regulate the apoptosis of macrophages induced by ox-LDL.","596":"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a severe cardiovascular disease.

Expression of miR-96-5p and BCL2L13 was evaluated by serum samples and cells utilizing Western blot and RT-qPCR assays. The diagnostic value of miR-96-5p in AMI-CAD was analyzed with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The correlation between miR-96-5p and BCL2L13 was examined by Spearman's correlation analysis. The level of oxidative stress and apoptosis were estimated via relative commercial kit, flow cytometry apoptosis assay and TUNEL staining assay. Our study discovered that miR-96-5p was down-regulated while BCL2L13 was up-regulated in patients with AMI-CAD. miR-96-5p was a potential diagnostic parameter, which may help distinguish AMI-CAD patients from healthy controls. In vitro experiments, miR-96-5p expression was down regulated while BCL2L13 was up-regulated in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. After confirming the targeted link of miR-96-5p to BCL2L13 using luciferase reporter and RNA pull down assays, we discovered that miR-96-5p overexpression may restore oxidative stress and cell apoptosis induced by hypoxia treatment in H9c2 cells; meanwhile, co-transfection with BCL2L13 overexpressing plasmid might partly countervail the ameliorative effects of miR-96-5p on oxidative stress and apoptosis. Collectively, miR-96-5p may function as a potential diagnostic biomarker for AMI-CAD patients, and the up-regulation of miR-96-5p would ameliorate AMI-associated cardiomyocytes injury by targeting BCL2L13, hence contributing to the clinical treatment of AMI-CAD.","597":null,"598":null,"599":null,"600":"SOCS3 is low-expressed in breast cancer and may be a potential target.

The expression of SOCS3 in breast cancer (BC) and its association with prognosis were evaluated by GEPIA and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) websites. BCSCs were sorted by flow cytometry and immunomagnetic bead method, followed by sphere formation, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and xenograft assays to test their effects in vitro and in vivo. The levels of SOCS3, EMT- and STAT3 pathway-related genes were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. The effects of liposome and UTMD on BCSCs and mice were compared by the gain-of-function experiments. Low expression of SOCS3 was associated with poor prognosis of BC patients, and found in BC and BCSCs. BCSCs were successfully sorted, with high viability and tumorigenicity. UTMD increased the transfection rate of SOCS3. Moreover, UTMD- and liposome-mediated SOCS3 reduced cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion, blocked cell cycle, inhibited sphere formation in BCSCs, and retarded tumor growth in mice. Mechanistically, overexpressed SOCS3 inhibited the expressions of EMT-related genes and the activation of STAT3 pathway in BCSCs and mice. The regulatory effects of UTMD-mediated SOCS3 on the above-mentioned biological characteristics were better than liposome-mediated SOCS3.

Moreover, Ang-(1-7) ameliorated HG-induced endothelial injury through downregulating chloride channel 3 (CIC-3) via Mas receptor. Furthermore, HG-induced CIC-3 enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokine production and reduced the level of nitric oxide (NO), while Ang-(1-7) preserved the impact of HG-induced CIC-3 on productions of ROS, cytokine and NO through inhibiting CIC-3 via Mas receptor.

Herein, our study found that MBNL1-AS1 was down-regulated both in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and it functioned as a tumor suppressor to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MiR-423-5p was found to be a target of MBNL1-AS1 with an inverse relationship: an increase in miR-423-5p could counteract the inhibitory effect induced by MBNL1-AS1 on cancer cell promotion. Further, CREBZF was negatively regulated by miR-423-5p. Accordingly, CREBZF knockdown could impair the hindrance of cancer cell growth mediated by low miR-423-5p expression. Also, MBNL1-AS1 influenced the PI3K\/AKT pathway, which was associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis, by regulating CREBZF. As a result, our work illustrated the tumor suppressor role of MBNL1-AS1 in breast cancer via upregulating miR-423-5p-targeted CREBZF.

Plasma samples were obtained retrospectively from a propensity-score matched cohort including 42 STEMI patients (21 consecutive VF and 21 non-VF). Ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in combination with a comprehensive analysis of metabolomic data using Metaboanalyst 5.0 version were performed. As a result, the retinal metabolism pathway proved to be the most discriminative for the VF phenotype. Furthermore, 9-cis-Retinoic acid (9cRA) and dehydrophytosphingosine proved to be the most discriminative biomarkers. Biomarker analysis through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed the 2-metabolite biomarker panel yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.836. The model based on Monte Carlo cross-validation found that 9cRA had the greatest probability of appearing in the predictive panel of biomarkers in the model. Validation of model efficiency based on an ROC curve showed that the combination model constructed by 9cRA and dehydrophytosphingosine had a good predictive value for early-onset VF after STEMI, and the AUC was 0.884 (95% CI 0.714-1).

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test, logistic regression analysis, Cox regression analysis, and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to assess the relationship between the clinicopathological characteristics and the prognosis of ccRCC patients and ADAM12 expression. The miRNAs and lncRNAs associated with ADAM12 were predicted, and a ceRNA network was constructed using the Starbase database. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis were used to identify relevant pathways. The relationship between ADAM12 and immune infiltration and checkpoints was analyzed using the TIMER and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. The results showed that ADAM12 expression was increased in ccRCC tissues and cells and significantly correlated with patient gender, Tumor stage, Metastasis stage, Node stage, and clinical grade. Survival analysis showed that ccRCC patients with high ADAM12 expression had a low overall survival rate. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that ADAM12 was an independent prognostic factor. Enrichment analysis showed that ADAM12 expression was associated with immune-related pathways.

Besides, hyperglycemia stimulated the higher expression of PFKFB3 along with the enhanced proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GC cells. Knocking down of PFKFB3 effectively reversed the effects of high glucose concentration on GC malignant phenotype and the opposite results were gained when miR-26-5p was inhibited. Therefore, PFKFB3 down-regulated by miR-26-5p inhibited the malignant phenotype of GC with hyperglycemia.","616":"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors globally. About 20-30% of patients with gastric cancer show peritoneal implantation metastasis at the first diagnosis. Peritoneal metastasis is responsible for 70% of deaths of patients with advanced gastric cancer. Although there are many ways to treat advanced gastric cancer, the prognosis of patients with recurrence is unsatisfactory. An auxiliary treatment with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), is an internationally recognized recommended treatment for advanced gastric cancer. A series of clinical trials have shown that HIPEC significantly improves the overall survival of patients with cancer. Compared with the cytoreductive surgery (CRS) alone, HIPEC combined with CRS markedly reduced the rate of peritoneal metastasis in patients with ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer. It has been demonstrated that HIPEC alters transcription of many genes by affecting non-coding RNAs, which may contribute to the suppressive effect of HIPEC on the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins in cancer cells. This paper reviews the recent advances in understanding the role of non-coding RNAs in tumor invasion and metastasis of advanced gastric cancer. We also consider changes in noncoding RNA levels and other molecules in advanced gastric cancer cases treated with HIPEC. We hope that our review will provide a reference for future research on molecular epidemiology and etiology of advanced gastric cancer and promote precise treatment of this malignancy using HIPEC.","617":"Osteosarcoma (OS) is solid tumors with high malignancy and incidence starting in the bones. OS pathogenesis has been proved to be closely associated with immune imbalance, and follicular helper T cells (Tfh) significantly affect host humoral immune homeostasis. However, there are few reports on the effect of Tfh cell activation on the prognosis of OS patients. Hence, this investigation on the changes in the proportion of peripheral blood Tfh cells in OS patients, and the relationship between their activity level and OS prognosis. We collected peripheral blood from patients with OS, benign bone tumor (BT group) and healthy subjects (Healthy group), respectively. The number of CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cell in peripheral blood was measured by flow cytometry and correlation analysis between its activity and OS clinicopathological characteristics was carried out. The data showed that in comparison with the BT and Healthy groups, higher proportion and activation level of peripheral blood CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells in CD4+ T cells were found in the OS group. In OS patients, increases of the proportion and activity level of Tfh cells were associated with poorly differentiated OS and tumor metastasis. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis showed a longer overall survival in patients with low proportion of peripheral blood CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells in CD4+ T cells, and their activation level may be a prognostic factor in OS patients. In conclusion, peripheral blood CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cell activation in OS patients was associated with a poor prognosis. This study provided ideas for improving the clinical treatment of OS patients.","618":"This study investigated the function of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) cytoskeleton regulator RNA (CYTOR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In HCC, the expression of CYTOR and microRNA (miR)-125a-5p were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of actin skeletal protein 1 (LASP1) was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Flow cytometry assays, transwell assays, colony formation assay, and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay were used to evaluate the roles of miR-125a-5p and CYTOR in HCC cells. The target genes of CYTOR and miR-125a-5p were identified by bioinformatics analysis and Luciferase assay. CYTOR was upregulated in HCC cell lines, and knockdown of CYTOR inhibited HCC cell growth. MiR-125a-5p was downregulated in HCC cells and a target of CYTOR in regulating HCC progression. Furthermore, LASP1 was a downstream target of miR-125a-5p. Finally, CYTOR was found to be involved in HCC progression in vivo. CYTOR promotes HCC development by regulating the miR-125a-5p\/LASP1 axis.","619":"The critical roles of lncRNAs in drug resistance of malignancies have been widely recognized. This investigation aims to study the function of lncRNA PCAT6 in the resistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to gefitinib. In our study, we demonstrated that prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) was upregulated in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC. PCAT6 knockdown inhibited gefitinib resistance of NSCLC, as indicated by decreased IC50 value, proliferation, and metastasis, and increased cell apoptosis. Besides, PCAT6 could directly target miR-326 in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells and augment NSCLC resistance to gefitinib by serving as ceRNA of miR-326. Furthermore, interferon-alpha receptor 2 (IFNAR2) was validated as a downstream target of miR-326 and miR-326 reduced resistance to gefitinib by inhibiting IFNAR2 expression. Our investigation identified that PCAT6 enhanced gefitinib resistance of NSCLC via miR-326\/IFNAR2 axis, which might offer a new therapeutic strategy against gefitinib resistance of NSCLC patients.","620":"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still one of the most challenging malignant tumors. Deregulation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) is associated with NSCLC progression. However, the regulatory mechanism of circRNAs in NSCLC still needs to be studied. We selected a differentially expressed hsa_circ_0006677 (circ_0006677) in NSCLC through analyzing the GSE158695 and GSE112214 datasets. Expression of circ_0006677 was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase-chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Effects of circ_0006677 overexpression on NSCLC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and stemness were determined by clonogenic, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), flow cytometry, transwell, and sphere formation assays. The regulatory mechanism of circ_0006677 was predicted by bioinformatics analysis and verified by dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Animal experiments were carried out to validate the function of circ_0006677 in vivo. We observed the downregulation of circ_0006677 in NSCLC samples and cells. Functionally, circ_0006677 overexpression decreased xenograft tumor growth and restrained NSCLC cell proliferation, invasion, migration, stemness, and induced NSCLC cell apoptosis in vitro. Molecular mechanism experiments exhibited that circ_0006677 functioned as a miR-1245a sponge and mediated SATB2 expression through adsorbing miR-1245a. Either miR-1245a overexpression or SATB2 knockdown weakened circ_0006677 overexpression-mediated repression on proliferation, invasion, migration, and stemness. In conclusion, circ_0006677 regulated SATB2-mediated tumor-suppressive effect via acting as a miR-1245a sponge in NSCLC, providing a new mechanism for understanding the progression of NSCLC.","621":null,"622":"Circular RNA (circRNA) is considered to be an important regulator that mediates cancer chemoresistance. But whether circ-LPAR3 is involved in ovarian cancer (OC) cisplatin (DDP) resistance is unclear. The circ-LPAR3, miR-634 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Cell cisplatin resistance and viability were measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In addition, cell colony number, apoptosis, and metastasis were assessed by colony formation assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay. Furthermore, in vivo experiments were performed by constructing mice xenograft models. RNA interaction was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, and PDK1 protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis. Our results showed that circ-LPAR3 was markedly upregulated in DDP-resistant OC tissues and cells. Silencing of circ-LPAR3 enhanced the DDP sensitivity of OC cells and tumors. MiR-634 could interact with circ-LPAR3, and its inhibitor overturned the regulation of si-circ-LPAR3 on cell DDP resistance. Additionally, PDK1 was targeted by miR-634, and its overexpression inverted the effect of miR-634 on cell DDP resistance. To sum up, circ-LPAR3 might contribute to the DDP resistance of OC via the miR-634\/PDK1 axis.","623":null,"624":"In recent years, the modulatory functions of some circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (AS) have been reported. Nonetheless, the role of circular RNA_0033596 (circ_0033596) in AS and its mechanism remains unclarified. In this study, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) was applied to treat human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to establish a cell model of endothelial cell injury. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were employed to detect the expression of circ_0033596, microRNA-217-5p (miR-217-5p), and chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) in HUVECs. The binding sites between circ_0033596 and miR-217-5p, as well as between miR-217-5p and CLIC4 mRNA 3'UTR were determined through a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. It was found that circ_0033596 expression was increased in ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. After ox-LDL stimulation, HUVEC viability and cell cycle progression were inhibited, and the apoptosis was promoted, while circ_0033596 overexpression aggravated these effects. MiR-217-5p was identified as a downstream target of circ_0033596, and circ_0033596 negatively regulated miR-217-5p expression. CLIC4 was identified as miR-217-5p's downstream target gene and could be positively modulated by circ_0033596. All in all circ_0033596 aggravates ox-LDL-induced HUVEC apoptosis by regulating the miR-217-5p\/CLIC4 axis, by which circ_0033596 participates in the pathogenesis of AS.","625":"Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally with catastrophic damages to the public health, social and economy since the beginning of the outbreak. In 2020, Southeast Asia proved that it could prevent the worst effects of a pandemic through the closure of activities and borders and movement restriction, as well as social distancing. Nevertheless, with the occurrence of the common variants of concern (VOCs), especially Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), Southeast Asia is facing a significant increase in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Now, the area also has the threats of the spreading out of the dangerous variant - Omicron (B.1.1.529) from other close countries or regions. COVID-19 countermeasures such as closures and social distancing seem to be insufficient. Moreover, Southeast Asia is being held back by a shortage of vaccines and other medical resources. This work focuses on describing the COVID-19 situation, the virus variants, and the coverage of COVID-19 vaccination in the area. We also provide perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine distribution, protecting the economic capitals, developing the green zone, and the importance of finding more vaccine supplies in Southeast Asia.","626":"Colorectal cancer presents high rates of recurrence and metastasis, and the occurrence and progression and mechanism of its invasion and metastasis are not fully understood. The expression of miR-656-3p in patient samples and 10 cell lines were measured. Bioinformatic databases were used to predict miRNAs. Protein expressions were examined using Western blot. Transwell assay was used to measure cell migration and invasion. Transplanted tumor model in nude mice was established. Removal of the miR-656-3p by specific knocking-down of this gene promoted the chemo-resistance of colorectal cancer cells. Critically, we identified sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1 (SGPP1) as a downsteam target of the miR-656-3p, which we first obtained from 199 potential target genes from Targetscan, 200 genes from miRDB and 200 genes from DIANA, respectively. Then, we identified the interaction between SGPP1 and the miR-656-3p on 3' UTR of SGPP1 gene. Knockdown of SGPP1 greatly suppressed the tumor growth in vivo and epithelial mesenchymal transition process. miR-656-3p could regulate cell proliferation and chemoresistance in the colorectal cancer that associate to downstream target with SGPP1. Along with its downstream molecule, we would like to predict that the SGPP1 associated miR-656-3p could be used to develop early for early diagnostics for CRC oncogenesis.","627":"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common causes of cancer death in men. BUB1B (BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine\/threonine kinase B) has been reported to contribute to the initiation and development of several cancers. Here, we aimed to explore the potential role of BUB1B in LUAD. We found BUB1B was upregulated in LUAD, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for LUAD diagnosis. Significantly, LUAD patients with high BUB1B expression had a shorter survival time than those with low BUB1B expression. Knocking-out BUB1B resulted in suppression of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and inhibition of tumor growth in the xenograft experiment. Further analysis revealed that BUB1B regulates glycolysis in LUAD and interacting with ZNF143 in LUAD cells. The interaction was demonstrated by silencing ZNF143, which led to a decrease in proliferation, migration, and invasion in LUAD cells, whereas overexpressing BUB1B had the opposite effects. Our study suggested that the ZNF143\/BUB1B axis plays a pivotal role in LUAD progression, which might be a potential target for LUAD management.","628":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stable and extensively distributed non-coding RNA molecules that are differentially expressed in liver cancer tissues in the human body. In this study, we aimed to investigate circRNA as a novel candidate biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For three groups of HCC and neighboring healthy tissues, the differentially expressed circRNAs were identified through high-throughput sequencing analysis. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were employed for the evaluation of circRNAs that show an elevated expression level in HCC. The obtained results revealed the significantly differential expression of hsa_circ_0006091 in HCC. Then we obtained their target genes through biological analysis, followed by verifying the underlined target genes, and the regulator of G-protein signaling 12 (RGS12) showed an elevated expression level in HCC tissues. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted on AFP, RGS12, and hsa_circ_0006091, and combined analysis was performed. Furthermore, hsa_circ_0006091 is a novel candidate biomarker for HCC and could improve the diagnostic strategies, prediction, and follow-up of HCC patients. The joint diagnosis of the hsa_circ_0006091&amp;AFP and hsa_circ_0006091&amp;RGS12 has diagnostic significance and can be used as a molecular marker for HCC diagnosis.Abbreviations: AUC:area under the ROC curve; ROC:Receptor Operating Characteristics; bp:base pair;mRNA:Messenger Ribonucleic acid;ceRNA:Competing endogenous RNA; RT-qPCR: Real time-quantitativen PCR technology; circRNA: circular RNA; HCC:Hepatocellular carcinoma;miRNA:microRNA;KEGG:Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; RGS12:regulator of G-protein signaling 12; AFP:alpha fetoprotein; ncRNAs:non-coding RNAs; GEO:Gene Expression Omnibus; FDR:false discovery rate.","629":"Wuling Decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used to open knots, benefit water, transform Qi, return fluid, and has a significant effect on strengthening the spleen and removing dampness. To explore the effects of Wuling Decoction on the intestinal tract and aquaporin in Adriamycin-induced nephropathy, 45 specific pathogen free (SPF) Wistar rats were randomly divided into a blank control group (5 rats), Dosing control group (10 rats), Adriamycin nephropathy model group (10 rats), diarrhea group (10 rats), and an Adriamycin nephropathy diarrhea model group (10 rats). The tissue localization of aquaporin (AQP) was determined by immunohistochemistry. The expression of AQP mRNA and protein was measured by RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The results indicated that Wuling Decoction causes excretion of AQP2 through the urine, regulates AQP2 levels, and exerts diuretic and anti-diarrheal effects. It also regulates the levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), affects water absorption rate, and reduces the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in each tissue, thus reducing the absorption of AQP2 to water. Wuling Decoction promoted AQP2 expression in the nephropathy model group and inhibited AQP2 expression in the diarrhea group. Wuling Decoction increased the expression of aquaporin in the intestinal tract, reduced the water content of stool by promoting the absorption of water in the intestinal tract, inhibited the expression of aquaporin and its regulatory factors in nephridia tissue, and reduced the reabsorption of water to increase urine volume, to decrease the occurrence of diarrhea.","630":"Previous studies indicated that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 1 antisense RNA1 (SPINT1-AS1) could function as an oncogenic gene in various human cancers. However, the regulatory mechanisms of SPINT1-AS1 in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. It was found that SPINT1-AS1 was upregulated in CRC and contributed to the poor prognosis of CRC patients. Silencing of SPINT1-AS1 inhibited proliferation and metastasis but increased apoptosis of CRC cells. Furthermore, we found that SP1 could activate SPINT1-AS1 by acting as a transcription factor. Meanwhile, we identified miR-214 was negatively regulated by SPINT1-AS1. Furthermore, miR-214 repression restored the suppressive effects on malignant biological behaviors of CRC caused by SPINT1-AS1 silencing. In addition, SPINT1-AS1 mediated HDGF expression through targeting miR-214. Finally, overexpressed heparin-binding growth factor (HDGF) overturned the effects on viability, metastasis, and apoptosis of CRC cells induced by SPINT1-AS1 depletion or miR-214 upregulation. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that SP1-induced SPINT1-AS1 could facilitate CRC progression by inhibiting miR-214 and increasing HDGF expression. These findings might provide a new approach for CRC treatment.","631":"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates. Circular RNAs collectively participate in the initiation and development of AMI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of circRbms1 in AMI. Ischemia-reperfusion (I\/R) was performed to establish an AMI model. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were performed to detect mRNA and analyze protein expression, respectively. The interaction between miR-92a and circRbms1\/BCL2L11 was confirmed by luciferase and RNA pull-down assays. circRbms1 is overexpressed in AMI. However, circRbms1 knockdown alleviated H9c2 cell apoptosis and reduced the release of reactive oxygen species. circRbms1 targeted miR-92a, the downregulation of which alleviated the effects of circRbms1 knockdown and increased oxidative stress and H9c2 cell apoptosis. Moreover, circRbms1 sponged miR-92a to upregulate BCL2L11, which modulated the expression of apoptosis-related genes. circRbms1 participated in myocardial I\/R injury by regulating the miR-92a\/BCL2L11 signaling pathway, which may provide a new strategy for the treatment of AMI.","632":"Ferroptosis is a kind of cell death triggered by intracellular phospholipid peroxidation. Human umbilical vein blood endothelial progenitor cells-Exosomes (EPCs-Exos) affect ferroptosis. This study sought to explore the mechanism of EPCs-Exos in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) ferroptosis. EPCs-Exos were isolated and identified. HUVECs were treated with Erastin at IC50 concentration. Ferroptosis-related indexes and iron ion content were detected using kits. HUVEC migration and angiogenesis before\/after ferroptosis inhibitor treatment were observed by cell scratch and angiogenesis assays. After Erastin induction, HUVECs were transfected with miR-30e-5p mimic, or treated with EPCs-Exos and EPCs-Exos transfected with miR-30e-5p inhibitor. miR-30e-5p expression was detected by RT-qPCR. The binding relationship between miR-30e-5p and specificity protein 1 (SP1) was verified by dual-luciferase assay. SP1 expression was detected by Western blot. HUVECs treated with Erastin and EPCs-Exos were transfected with pcDNA3.1-SP1. Protein levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p-AMPK were detected by Western blot. EPCs-Exos inhibited Erastin-induced HUVEC ferroptosis and endothelial injury. Erastin inhibited miR-30e-5p and EPCs-Exo treatment recovered miR-30e-5p expression. miR-30e-5p was encapsulated in EPCs-Exos. After inhibiting miR-30e-5p in EPCs, the inhibitory effect of EPCs-Exos on HUVEC ferroptosis was attenuated. miR-30e-5p targeted SP1. Overexpression of SP1 partially reversed the effect of EPCs-Exos on improving HUVEC ferroptosis and increasing phosphorylation levels of AMPK. Collectively, EPCs-Exos inhibited Erastin-induced HUVEC ferroptosis by upregulating miR-30e-5p, inhibiting SP1, and activating the AMPK pathway.","633":null,"634":null,"635":"Endothelial dysfunction is a critical mediator in the pathogenesis of vascular complications of diabetes. Herein, this study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) on diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms. Diabetic models were established both in db\/db mice and high glucose (HG)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, HUVECs were exposed to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) to induce endothelial cell damage. Following Sal B treatment, pathological changes of thoracic aorta were investigated by hematoxylin and eosin, alcian blue (AB), elastic fiber, Masson, and reticular fiber staining. BCL2-associated X (BAX), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Beclin1, Parkin and PTEN Induced Kinase 1 (Pink1) expression was detected by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence in thoracic aorta, HG- and CCCP-induced HUVECs. Cell scratch test, MitoTracker Red CMXRos staining and Flou-4 AM staining were separately presented to detect migration, mitochondrial activity and intracellular Ca2+ in HUVECs. Our results showed that Sal B significantly ameliorated hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance in db\/db mice. Furthermore, it significantly alleviated diabetes-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction according to histopathology analysis. In diabetic thoracic aorta, HG- and CCCP-induced HUVECs, Sal B distinctly increased Bcl-2 expression and reduced BAX, Beclin1, Parkin and Pink1 expression, thereby protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis and mitophagy. Moreover, Sal B markedly enhanced migration, mitochondrial activity and intracellular Ca2+ levels both in HG- and CCCP-induced HUVECs. Collectively, Sal B exhibited a potential to improve diabetes-induced endothelial and mitochondrial dysfunction through down-regulating apoptosis and mitophagy of endothelial cells.Abbreviations: DM: diabetes mellitus; T2DM: type 2 diabetes mellitus; Sal B: Salvianolic acid B; HG: high glucose; FBG: fasting blood glucose; TC: total cholesterol; TG: triglycerides; LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; FINS: fasting insulin; HOMA-IR: homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance; QUICKI: quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index; H&amp;E: hematoxylin and eosin; HUVECs: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; IHC: immunohistochemistry; CCCP: carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone; FCM: flow cytometry; CCK-8: cell counting kit-8.","636":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant myeloproliferative tumor. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME) is an endogenous estrogen metabolite that shows efficacy in human malignancies. Ascorbic acid (AA) possesses antioxidant activity. This study explored the mechanism of 2-ME combined with AA in the apoptosis of CML cells. Firstly, human CML cell lines were treated with 2-ME and AA. The cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected. miR-223 expression in CML cells was detected. In addition, CML cells were transfected with miR-223 inhibitor. The binding relationship between miR-223 and FLT3 was verified. Subsequently, the FLT3 was overexpressed or silenced for the function rescue experiment to confirm the role of FLT3 in CML cell apoptosis. The expression levels of key factors of the PI3K\/AKT pathway were detected. Finally, xenograft nude mouse models were established for in vivo verification. 2-ME + AA treatment inhibited CML cell viability and promoted apoptosis, elevated ROS content, and reduced MMP. 2-ME + AA treatment promoted miR-223 expression in CML cells. miR-223 targeted FLT3. Moreover, miR-223 inhibitor or FLT3 overexpression partially annulled the effect of 2-ME + AA on CML cells. 2-ME + AA inhibited the PI3K\/AKT pathway via the miR-223\/FLT3 axis. Furthermore, 2-ME + AA suppressed CML xenograft growth in mice. Collectively, 2-ME + AA promoted miR-223 expression and suppressed FLT3 and the PI3K\/AKT pathway, thereby facilitating the apoptosis of CML cells and inhibiting CML xenograft growth in mice.","637":null,"638":"Elevated evidences manifest that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are vital in human tumor advancement and chemotherapy resistance. The study was to explore the character of Circ-CUL2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Firstly, the expression of circ-CUL2, microRNA (miR)-888-5p and RB1CC1 was detected in human NSCLC tissues and cell lines by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. Then, cell counting kit (CCK)-8, plate clone, Transwell assays, and flow cytometry were applied to separately detect the impacts of circ-CUL2 on proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and cisplatin (DDP) resistance of A549\/DDP cells. In this study, exploration of the biological function of Circ-CUL2 was via the Circ-CUL2\/miR-888-5p\/RB1CC1 axis. The results manifested circ-CUL2 and RB1CC1 were down-regulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, while miR-888-5p was up-regulated. Elevated Circ-CUL2 or refrained miR-888-5p repressed A549\/DDP cell progression with depressive DDP resistance. Circ-CUL2 curbed miR-888-5p, which targeted RB1CC1. Restrained RB1CC1 turned around the impacts of Circ-CUL2 on the cells. All in all, Circ-CUL2 is anti-NSCLC via miR-888-5p\/RB1CC1 axis, enhancing the sensitivity of A549\/DDP cells to DDP.

However, the biological roles of m6A and lncRNAs in lung cancer tumorigenesis are largely unknown. In this study, SVIL antisense RNA 1 (SVIL-AS1) was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues and was associated with a favorable prognosis in patients with LUAD. SVIL-AS1 overexpression suppressed LUAD cell proliferation and blocked cell cycle arrest. Mechanistically, METTL3 increased the m6A modification and transcript stability of SVIL-AS1. The enhanced SVIL-AS1 expression mediated by METTL3 suppressed E2F1 and E2F1-target genes. Moreover, SVIL-AS1 accelerated E2F1 degradation. The reduction in cell proliferation induced by SVIL-AS1 overexpression could be rescued by E2F1 overexpression or METTL3 knockdown. In conclusion, our work demonstrated the role and mechanism of METTL3-induced SVIL-AS1 in LUAD, which connects m6A and lncRNA in lung cancer carcinogenesis.","640":"Keloid is a skin disease marked by fibroplasia, and fibroblasts viability plays a considerable part in keloid. Our research was devoted to assessing the involvement and mechanism of circPTPN12 in keloid. The level of circPTPN12 and miR-21-5p was estimated by qRT-PCR in keloid tissues and cells. MTT analysis was devoted to evaluating the multiplication of keloid fibroblasts. Additionally, transwell assay was dedicated to verifying cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, keloid fibroblasts apoptosis level was assessed adopting flow cytometry, and the relevancy between miR-21-5p and circPTPN12, miR-21-5p, and SMAD7 was assessed by dual luciferase assay. Similarly, RIP and RNA pull-down assay verified the relevance between genes. Moreover, levels of SMAD7 and proteins concerned in Wnt signaling pathway were appraised by Western blot. The level of circPTPN12 declined in keloid. circPTPN12 knockout could enhance the multiplication, migration, invasion, and decline apoptosis of keloid fibroblasts. Indeed, miR-21-5p could be packed with circPTPN12 sponge, SMAD7 was downstream effect factor of miR-21-5p, and miR-21-5p inhibitors partially reversed the promoting effect of silencing circPTPN12 on keloid formation. Otherwise, the level of SMAD7 was adjusted by circPTPN12 and miR-21-5p. Silencing circPTPN12 targeted miR-21-5p and activated Wnt pathway to accelerate keloid fibroblasts growth. Taken together, silencing circPTPN12 promotes the growth of keloid fibroblasts by activating Wnt pathway targeting miR-21-5p. CircPTPN12 may play a considerable part in keloid formation, which supplies a reference for molecularly targeted therapy keloid.","641":"Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) is involved in immune regulation, cell survival, and tumor progression. Studies have demonstrated that SPP1 plays an important role in certain individual tumors. However, the expression profile and oncogenic features of SPP1 in diverse cancers are remaining unknown. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Raw data of 33 cancer types were download from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Xena website. The expression of SPP1 and its relationship with tumor prognosis, immune invasion, tumor microenvironment, and immunotherapy were analyzed using the R language. The function analysis was conducted using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The oncogenic features of SPP1 was validated by wound-healing assay and EdU staining assay. SPP1 highly expressed in most cancers. The expression of SPP1 was significant related to prognosis, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and immune checkpoint genes, suggested that SPP1 plays an essential role in the tumor immune microenvironment and immune cell infiltration. The immune\/stromal scores correlated positively with the SPP1 expression, and the relationship was affected by tumor heterogeneity and immunotherapy. In addition, SPP1 could predict the response of tumor immunotherapy. Functional analysis revealed the SPP1-associated terms and pathways. Finally, SPP1 significantly elevated cell proliferation and migration in A549, Huh7, HT-29, A2780 tumor cell lines.

The analysis revealed 21 active compounds and 101 potential targets of BX-YYR from the pharmacological database of Chinese medicine system and analysis platform (TCMSP) and 1020 related targets of insomnia from the GeneCards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) databases. Furthermore, 38 common targets of BX-YYR against insomnia were identified, and these common targets were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The visual PPI network was constructed by Cytoscape software. The top three genes from PPI according to degree value are FOS, AKT1, and CASP3. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were applied to reveal the potential targets and signaling pathways involved in BX-YYR against insomnia, especially the serotonergic pathway. In addition, molecular docking revealed that baicalein, beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol displayed strong binding to AKT1, FOS, PRKCA, and VEGFA. Experimental study found that BX-YYR against insomnia might play a role in improving sleep by modulating the serotonergic pathway. In summary, our findings revealed the underlying mechanism of BX-YYR against insomnia and provided an objective basis for further experimental study and clinical application.","643":null,"644":"In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of long non-coding RNA terminal differentiation-induced non-coding RNA (TINCR) in cisplatin (DDP) resistance of choroidal melanoma (CM) and the potential molecular mechanisms. CM and non-CM tissues were collected from 60 CM patients. DDP-resistant CM cells were obtained by selection with linearly increased DDP treatment. The expression levels of TINCR, microR-19b-3p (miR-19b-3p), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK-2) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) assay was utilized to detect chemosensitivity and cell viability. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to detect apoptotic cells. The protein levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved-caspase-3, ERK-2, and nuclear factor-kappa B p65 were measured by Western blot. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to determine the relationship among TINCR, miR-19b-3p, and ERK-2. The results showed that the levels of TINCR and ERK-2 were markedly increased in DDP-resistant CM tissues and cells, while miR-19b-3p level was significantly reduced. TINCR knockdown reduced DDP resistance and cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis, while TINCR overexpression exhibited opposite effects. TINCR and ERK-2 were direct targets of miR-19b-3p. Further experiments revealed that TINCR enhanced DDP resistance in CM cells by regulating the miR-19b-3p\/ERK-2\/NF-kb axis. Taken together, our study revealed a critical role of TINCR in regulating DDP resistance in CM and suggested that TINCR is a potential cisplatin-resistant CM therapeutic target.","645":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes (Exo) are beneficial in the use of brain damages. Restrictively, the mechanism of Exo expressing miR-124-3p in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is not completely comprehended. Thereupon, this work was put forward to reveal the action of bone marrow MSCs-derived Exo (BMSCs-Exo) expressing miR-124-3p in the illness. BMSCs were isolated and transfected with miR-124-3p agomir. Then, BMSCs-Exo were extracted and identified. The newborn HIBD rats were injected with miR-124-3p-modified BMSCs-Exo or tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-related vectors. Next, neurological functions, neuron pathological and structural damages, oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis were observed. miR-124-3p and TRAF6 expression was tested, along with their targeting relationship. miR-124-3p was down-regulated, and TRAF6 was up-regulated in newborn HIBD rats. miR-124-3p targeted TRAF6. BMSCs-Exo improved neurological functions, alleviated neuron pathological and structural damages, suppressed oxidative stress and reduced neuronal apoptosis in newborn HIBD rats, whereas BMSCs-Exo-mediated effects were enhanced by restoring miR-124-3p. Silencing TRAF6 attenuated HIBD in newborn rats, but overexpression of TRAF6 reversed the protective role of miR-124-3p-overexpressing BMSCs-Exo. This work makes it comprehensive that up-regulated exosomal miR-124-3p ameliorates HIBD in newborn rats by targeting TRAF6, which replenishes the potential agents for curing HIBD.","646":"Study shows that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a regulatory role in cardiovascular diseases, and the mechanism of rhabdomyosarcoma 2-associated transcript (RMST) in atherosclerosis (AS) is still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of RMST and its possible role in the occurrence of AS. RMST and miR-224-3p level in serum and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In vitro atherosclerotic cell model was achieved by treating HUVECs with ox-LDL. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assessed the diagnostic value of RMST in AS, and Pearson correlation coefficient estimated the correlation of RMST with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to evaluate the effect of RMST on cell viability and inflammatory response. The luciferase analysis was used to validate the relationship between RMST and miR-224-3p. The results showed that in serum and HUVECs, RMST levels were increased, while miR-224-3p level was decreased. ROC curve suggested that RMST had clinical diagnostic value for AS. Besides, CIMT and cfPWV were positively correlated with RMST levels, respectively. In HUVECs, RMST-knockdown notably improved the cell viability and inhibited the production of inflammatory factors. Moreover, miR-224-3p was the target of RMST. In conclusion, RMST has the potential to be a diagnostic marker for AS. RMST-knockdown contributes to the enhancement of cell viability and the inhibition of inflammatory response, which may provide new insights into the conquest of AS.","647":null,"648":null,"649":"Increasing studies have highlighted the importance of ferroptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, how to use ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) to predict the prognosis and guide the treatment of CRC remains unknown. To build a prognostic prediction model using the GEO and TCGA databases and explored a therapeutic strategy for CRC patients based on FRGs. A total of 60 FRGs were identified and three of them including ACACA, GSS, and NFS1 were associated with the prognosis of CRC. Using Lasso regression analysis, an FRGs signature was constructed and validated as an independent prognostic predictor. Then we developed a nomogram based on the FRGs signature and clinical prognostic factors to predict the prognosis of CRC patients, which was better than the traditional TNM staging system. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was further performed for the functional analysis and suggested that JAK-STAT signaling, Ras signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were significantly enriched in CRC patients with higher FRGs risk score. Interestingly, CRC cells with higher FRGs risk score were more sensitive to RSL3. Knocking down GSS and NFS1 increased the FRGs risk score and the sensitivity of CRC cells to RSL3. For the clinic use, we screened 75 FDA-approved cancer drugs and found that Fludarabine phosphate could decrease the expression of GSS and NFS1 most. Fludarabine phosphate, in combination with RSL3, showed a strong synergistic effect on CRC cells. Together, this study identified a potent prognostic model and provided an alternative individualized treatment for CRC patients.","650":"The emerging evidence showed that lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) could regulate the progression and affect the malignant behaviors of cancers. LncRNA SNHG8 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 8) has been reported to participate in most cancers development. Here in this study, the role of lncRNA SNHG8 in esophageal cancer was uncovered by a series of functional experiments. The expression pattern of SNHG8 in tumor tissues or cells was first detected by qRT-PCR. Using a lentivirus knockdown shRNA is to repress the expression of SNHG8. Subsequently, the in vitro and in vivo experiments were utilized to evaluate whether the malignant behaviors of esophageal cancer were influenced by knockdown SNHG8. The results indicated that lncRNA SNHG8 should be a cancer-promoting factor with a relatively high expression level in esophageal cancer. Moreover, knockdown SNHG8 inhibited the cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in KYSE30 and TE-1 cells. In addition, based on the results of the binding site analysis and the luciferase reporter system, SNHG8 functions by the miR-1270\/BACH1 axis. The follow-up experiments verified that lncRNA SNHG8 could down-regulate the expression of miR-1270 to increase the BACH1 expression. Finally, we confirmed that knockdown SNHG8 retarded the progression of esophageal cancer with a xenograft model. To sum up, our findings suggested that lncRNA SNHG8 is a cancer-promoting factor in esophageal cancer. Knockdown SNHG8 could suppress the progression of esophageal cancer, which implies SNHG8 could be used as a therapeutic target in esophageal cancer.","651":null,"652":null,"653":"We aimed to explore the role of circ-SOX5 in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The circRNAs in HCC were screened using the GEO database. RT-qPCR was used to detect mRNA expression. Targeting relationships were confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay. CCK-8 and EDU staining were used to measure cell viability and proliferation, respectively. Cell apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Circ-SOX5 expression was increased in HCC tissues. Inhibition of circ-SOX5 expression reduced the viability, proliferation, and colony formation, and increased the apoptosis of HCC cells. However, miR-502-5p inhibition or overexpression of synoviolin 1 (SYVN1) can reverse the effects of circ-SOX5 knockdown on proliferation and apoptosis. This study demonstrated that the circ-SOX5\/miR-502-5p\/SYVN1 axis promotes the development of HCC by regulating cell apoptosis.

Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) localizes to the hepatocyte apical membrane and plays a pivotal role in the biliary excretion of bilirubin glucuronides. RFP is discovered to reduce MRP2 expression in liver cells. 4-Phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a drug used to treat ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (DILI), is reported to alleviate RFP-induced liver cell injury. However, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. In the current study, we discovered that RFP induced HepG2 cell viability reduction, apoptosis and MRP2 ubiquitination degradation. Administration of 4-PBA alleviated the effect of RFP on HepG2 cell viability reduction, apoptosis and MRP2 ubiquitination degradation. In mechanism, 4-PBA suppressed RPF-caused intracellular Ca2+ disorder and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as well as the increases of Clathrin and adapter protein 2 (AP2). ER stress marker protein C\/EBP homologous protein took part in the modulation of AP2 and clathrin. Besides, 4-PBA reduced the serum bilirubin level in RFP-induced cholestasis mouse model, along with raised the MRP2 expression in liver tissues. These findings indicated that 4-PBA could alleviate RFP-induced cholestatic liver injury and thereby decreased serum total bilirubin concentration via inhibiting ER stress and ubiquitination degradation of MRP2, which provides new insights into the mechanism of 4-PBA in the treatment of RFP-induced cholestasis and liver damage.","658":"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastrointestinal disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pancreatic acinar intracellular trypsinogen activation (PAITA) is an important event in the early stage of AP. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) and the microRNA regulatory network on pancreatic acinar intracellular trypsinogen activation (PAITA) and identify novel key targets in AP. Taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate (TLC-S)-treated AR42J cells were used to establish a PAITA model. Twenty differentially expressed tRFs and 35 DE microRNAs were identified in PAITA through gene sequencing. Based on these genes, we established the tRF-mRNA and microRNA-mRNA regulatory networks by using bioinformatics methods. The networks revealed 29 hub microRNAs (e.g., Let-7 family, miR-21-3p.) and 19 hub tRFs (e.g., tRF3-Thr-AGT, i-tRF-Met-CAT) in PAITA. GO analysis showed that the functions of the two networks were similar and mainly enriched in RNA splicing, mRNA processing, and so on. tRF3-Thr-AGT, targeting Btg2, Cd44, Zbp1, etc., was significantly decreased in PAITA. Moreover, the trypsinogen activation level was increased significantly in the tRF3-Thr-AGT deficiency groups, but rescued by tRF3-Thr-AGT mimics. The results revealed that downregulated tRF3-Thr-AGT was involved in PAITA. This study provides potential novel targets for researching the underlying mechanisms of AP.","659":"RAS protein activator like 2 (Rasal2) exerts pro-proliferative effect in several types of cells. However, whether Rasal2 is involved in the regulation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) remains unclear. In the current study, we explored the role of Rasal2 in proliferation and migration of PASMC during the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We found that the protein level of Rasal2 was increased in both pulmonary arteries of chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (CH-PH) mice and hypoxia-challenged PASMC. Overexpression of Rasal2 caused enhanced proliferation and migration of PASMC after hypoxia exposure. Mechanistically, we found elevated phosphorylation of AKT and two downstream effectors of mammalian target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), S6 and 4E-Binding Protein 1 (4EBP1) after Rasal2 overexpression in hypoxia-challenged PASMC. Inactivation of mTORC1 abolished Rasal2-mediated enhancement of proliferation and migration of PASMC. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that AKT might act downstream of Rasal2 to enhance the activity of mTORC1. Once AKT was inactivated by MK-2206 application, overexpression of Rasal2 failed to further increase the phosphorylation level of S6 and 4EBP1. Finally, inhibition of AKT also blocked Rasal2-induced proliferation and migration in hypoxia-challenged PASMC. In conclusion, Rasal2 promotes the proliferation and migration of PASMC during the development of PAH via AKT\/mTORC1 pathway.","660":null,"661":"Pancreatic cancer with about 5% five-year overall survival rate remains a challenge. Invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells are the main factors leading to poor prognosis. MicroRNA-490-5p (miR-490-5p) has anti-cancer effects in a variety of tumors, but its role in pancreatic cancer has not been reported. The mRNA expressions of miR-490-5p, MAGI2 antisense RNA 3 (MAGI2-AS3), Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, while the protein expressions of these genes except miR-490-5p were measured by Western blot analysis. The cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), apoptosis and transwell assays. MiR-490-5p was abnormally low-expressed in pancreatic cancer, whose down-regulation generated enhanced effects on viability, migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells, as well as MAGI2-AS3 expression. MiR-490-5p mimic exerted the opposite effect on cells, which also down-regulated MMP2, MMP9, and N-cadherin protein expressions, while up-regulating E-cadherin protein expression. MAGI2-AS3, which was the targeted binding site of miR-490-5p, promoted viability, migration and invasion, and inhibited apoptosis of cancer cells. More importantly, miR-490-5p played an anti-cancer role in pancreatic cancer by targeting MAGI2-AS3 and regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which was partially offset by MAGI2-AS3.","662":null,"663":"Acute pancreatitis (AP), which causes severe morbidity and mortality, is a heavy burden for people clinically and financially. This study was designed to explore the mechanism of AP and try to find effective therapies against AP. The expression of FXYD5 was interfered by performing transfection. RT-qPCR and Western blot were utilized to measure FXYD5 expression. In addition, the viability, apoptosis and inflammatory response were evaluated using CCK-8, TUNEL and ELISA, respectively. Moreover, Western blot was employed to measure the expressions of apoptosis-, inflammation- and signaling pathway-related proteins. FXYD5 was found to be overexpressed in AP patients and AP cell model. The results showed that in cerulein-induced AR42J cells, cell viability was remarkably increased, and apoptosis was inhibited compared to the normal FXYD5-expressing group because FXYD5 was downregulated. Similarly, in such cells, interference with FXYD5 significantly suppressed the inflammatory response. In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that JAK2\/STAT3 signaling was also strongly inhibited by FXYD5 interference. However, the effect of FXYD5 downregulation was reversed upon simultaneous activation of JAK2\/STAT3 signaling. In conclusion, downregulation of FXYD5 could promote cell viability and alleviate inflammatory response in cerulein-induced AP via blocking JAK2\/STAT3 signaling pathway.","664":null,"665":"Lung adenocarcinoma is the main cause of the excessive mortality for patients who lives with lung cancers. According to the GEPIA database analysis, GATA5 and ARHGAP9 were found to be low expressed in lung adenocarcinoma, and they were positively correlated, and in addition ARHGAP9 low expression was associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the present study focused on the effect of promoting GATA5 to induce ARHGAP9 on the malignant process of lung adenocarcinoma cells. The expressions of GATA5 and ARHGAP9 were measured with Western blot and RT-qPCR. With the adoption of CCK-8, EDU staining, transwell and colony formation, the cell viability, proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis ability were detected, respectively. In addition, the wound healing and Western blot were employed to evaluate migration and metastasis-related proteins individually. Moreover, the luciferase activity as well as the binding of GATA5 and ARHGAP9 promoters were detected by luciferase report and ChIP. After further comprehensive assessments, the results confirmed that GATA5 could successfully activate ARHGAP9. Moreover, ARHGAP9 upregulation remarkably inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, invasion and migration as compared to the control group. More importantly, GATA5 silencing reversed the inhibitory effect of ARHGAP9 upregulation on the malignant progression of lung adenocarcinoma cells. To conclude, the present study successfully demonstrated for the first time that GATA5-induced ARHGAP9 upregulation has a protective effect on lung adenocarcinoma cells.","666":null,"667":"The EIF3 gene family is essential in controlling translation initiation during the cell cycle.

And EIF3B was chosen for mutation analysis via the Cancer SEA online tool. Meanwhile, we performed the immunohistochemical assay, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blotting to analyze EIF3B expression levels in breast cancer. An EIF3B knockdown and a negative control cell line were conducted for MTT assay and cell cycle analysis to assess cell growth. Specifically, the results of TCGA and online databases demonstrated that upregulated EIF3B was associated with poorer overall and advanced tumor progression. We also confirmed that EIF3B was more highly expressed in breast cancer cells and tissues than normal and correlated with a worse outcome.

In this study, ZBTB24 expression was compared between decidua tissues of RSA patients and induced abortion controls from a published dataset, which was further validated in placental villi tissues by RT-qPCR and Western blot. The roles of ZBTB24 in trophoblast proliferation, differentiation, and migration were investigated by functional assays after ZBTB24 knockdown or overexpression in HTR-8\/SVneo cells. Our results showed that ZBTB24 expression was significantly decreased in RSA patients, and ZBTB24 expression level positively regulated cell viability, differentiation, and migration in HTR-8\/SVneo cells. We further demonstrated that ZBTB24 modulated the expression of E-cadherin by altering the DNA methylation at the promoter region.

Methotrexate (MTX) resistance is the main cause of treatment failure in choriocarcinoma. However, the mechanism of MTX resistance in choriocarcinoma is poorly known. This study aims to explore the function of Lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 binding protein (LGALS3BP) in MTX-resistance in choriocarcinoma cells. Gradual dose escalation of MTX was used to establish MTX-resistant choriocarcinoma cells (JAR-MTX and JEG3-MTX cell lines). RNA-sequencing was used to explore the differentially expressed genes. Plasmids or SiRNA transfection was used to regulate the expression of LGALS3BP. ELISA was used to detect the concentrations of LGALS3BP in the serum of MTX-sensitive and MTX-resistant patients. qRT-PCR, Western blot, and CCK-8 assay were used to determine the effects of LGALS3BP on MTX-resistance in JAR and JEG3 cells. The results showed the relative resistance index (RI) of MTX is 791.50 and 1040.04 in JAR-MTX and JEG3-MTX, respectively. LGALS3BP was up-regulated in MTX-resistant cells compared to original cells in both RNA and protein level. The concentrations of LGALS3BP were higher in the sera of MTX-resistant patients than in MTX-sensitive patients. Knocking down LGALS3BP can reverse the MTX-resistance in JAR-MTX and JEG3-MTX cells. In summary, we preliminarily established two MTX-resistant cells, and performed RNA-sequencing, and found LGALS3BP may play important role in MTX-resistance.

Therefore, it is essential to find new effective anti-HBV compounds. Here, we identified matrine as a novel inhibitor of PKC (protein kinase C) phosphorylated kinase by screening a natural compound library. After HepG2.215 cells were treated with matrine, we carried out a phosphorylated proteomics sequence study and analyzed the prediction of related kinase expression level. In the case of HBV infection, it was found that PKC kinase mediates the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway known as son of sevenless (SOS) activation. It was also found that PKC kinase inhibits the expression of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 8 (CXCL8) by inhibiting the activity of activating transcription factor 2\/ cAMP response element binding protein (ATF2\/CREB), and this effect is independent of its activated MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, Western blot was used to detect the expression of MAPK, ATF2, CREB3 phosphorylation and nonphosphorylation in matrine-treated cells and PKC-treated cells. PKC phosphorylated kinase inhibitor-matrine suppresses the replication of HBV via modulating the MAPK\/ATF2 signal.

Optimal therapies for NPC are still needed. In this investigation, we attempted to explore whether BarH-like homeobox 2 (BARX2), a well-known tumor suppressor, had anti-cancer properties on NPC, and the possible mechanisms. After searching for NPC-related databases, we determined BARX2 as one of the core genes in NPC. The results of RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry or Western blot demonstrated that BARX2 was reduced in NPC patients and cells. Ectopic expression of BARX2 reverted the malignant phenotype of NPC cells. Mechanistically, BARX2 bound to the keratin 16 (KRT16) promoter to downregulate its expression. In addition, BARX2 was found to reduce the phosphorylation levels of MEK and ERK. Further KRT16 upregulation in cells overexpressing BARX2 promoted malignant aggressiveness of C666-1 and HNE3 cells and activated the Ras signaling pathway. BARX2 inhibited the growth and metastasis of tumors and suppressed the Ras signaling pathway in vivo. In conclusion, our findings indicate that BARX2 reverts malignant phenotypes of NPC cells by downregulating KRT16 in a Ras-dependent fashion. BARX2 might act as a possible therapeutic regulator for NPC.","680":null,"681":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important players in regulating diverse human diseases, including cancers.

The regulatory functions of LINC00662 and miR-195-5p on CEP55 were examined utilizing Western blot. In this study, it was revealed that LINC00662 expression level was elevated in GC tissues and cells. LINC00662 overexpression facilitated the malignant biological behaviors of GC cells whereas knockdown of LINC00662 worked oppositely. In terms of mechanism, LINC00662 targeted miR-195-5p to modulate CEP55 expression.

This study aims to explore the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infected myocardium based on omics by collecting transcriptome data and analyzing them with a series of bioinformatics tools. Totally, 86 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were discovered in SARS-CoV-2 infected CMs, and 15 miRNAs were discovered to target 60 genes. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these DEGs were mainly enriched in the inflammatory signaling pathway. After the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, several genes including CCL2 and CXCL8 were regarded as the hub genes. SRC inhibitor saracatinib was predicted to potentially act against the cardiac dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2. Among the 86 DEGs, 28 were validated to be dysregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected hearts. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) showed that malaria, IL-17 signaling pathway, and complement and coagulation cascades were significantly enriched.

Macrophages have the function of eliminating these crystals, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we attempted to determine the role of macrophage-derived exosomes exposed to CaOx crystals in regulating apoptosis of human proximal tubular cells (HK-2). Exosomes (CaOx-Exo) were isolated from CaOx-treated macrophages and then incubated with HK-2 cells. CaOx-Exo treatment reduced cell viability and promoted apoptosis of HK-2 cells. The expression of Caspase-3 and Bax was increased, and Bcl-2 expression was decreased in HK-2 cells following CaOx-Exo treatment. Moreover, CaOx-Exo treatment caused an increase of LC3-II\/LC3-I ratio and Beclin-1 expression and a downregulation of p62 in HK-2 cells. GFP-LC3 puncta were increased in HK-2 cells following CaOx-Exo treatment. Additionally, CaOx-Exo-treated HK-2 cells were treated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) to inhibit autophagy activity. 3-MA treatment weakened the impact of CaOx-Exo on cell viability and apoptosis of HK-2 cells. 3-MA treatment also reduced the LC3-II\/LC3-I ratio and Beclin-1 expression and enhanced p62 expression in CaOx-Exo-treated HK-2 cells. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that exosomes derived from CaOx-treated macrophages promote apoptosis of HK-2 cells by promoting autophagy. Thus, this work suggests that macrophage-derived exosomes may play a vital role in CaOx-induced human proximal tubular cell damage.","684":"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

The direct interaction between miR-3648 and SOCS2 mRNA was identified through luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. Cell viability, migration, and invasion were examined using cell functional assays. MiR-3648 was found to be overexpressed in LUAD cells and tissues. Overexpression of miR-3648 significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities in LUAD cells. Furthermore, SOCS2 was targeted by miR-3648, and co-transfection of a miR-3648 inhibitor or si-SOCS2 reversed the suppressive effects of SOCS2 in PC9 and A549 cells. miR-3648 enhanced the proliferation and promoted migration and invasion of LUAD by inhibiting SOCS2. In conclusion, our results indicate that miR-3648 plays a pivotal role in LUADe progression and might thus provide a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with LUAD.","685":"Wogonin is an effective component of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, which exhibits anti-tumor activity. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of wogonin on colon cancer (CC). Human CC cell lines, SW480 and HCT116, were cultured, and MTT assay was performed to detect cell survival. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to measure mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The migration and invasion abilities of the CC cells were determined by a transwell assay. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to determine the localization of IRF3. Xenograft mice were used to investigate the effects of wogonin on CC in vivo. Wogonin inhibited the survival and metastasis of CC cells. In addition, wogonin suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, the protein expression of YAP1 and IRF3 was downregulated, and p-YAP1 was upregulated after wogonin treatment. Wogonin also suppressed IRF3 expression in the nuclei of CC cells and overexpression of YAP1 reversed the effects of wogonin in CC cells. Finally, wogonin inhibited the tumor growth in the mice and overexpression of YAP1 reversed the wogonin effects. Thus, these results showed that wogonin relieved the carcinogenic behaviors and EMT of CC cells via the IRF3-mediated Hippo signaling pathway.","686":null,"687":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often diagnosed in patients with advanced disease who are ineligible for curative surgical therapies. Sorafenib is a first-line agent approved for the treatment of advanced HCC. However, the frequent resistance of HCC cells to sorafenib greatly reduces its efficacy. Herein, we describe a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) conferring sorafenib resistance. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1273 (LINC01273) was significantly overexpressed in human HCC and sorafenib-resistant tissues, linking it to poor overall and relapse-free survival. We established sorafenib-resistant Huh7 (Huh7-SR) and SMMC-7721 (SMMC-7721-SR) cells, and found that the knockdown of LINC01273 repressed the viability, colony formation, and DNA synthesis rate of Huh7-SR and SMMC-7721-SR cells. The level of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells was significantly decreased, which was rescued by LINC01273 silencing. Mechanistically, LINC01273 complementarity bound to miR-600, served as a 'reservoir' increasing miR-600 stability, and facilitating miR-600 targeting methyltransferase 3 (METTL3), a m6A 'writer', resulting in reducing METTL3 level. In addition, LINC01273 was modified with m6A, METTL3 increased LINC01273 m6A modification, followed by LINC01273 decay in the presence of YTHDF2, a m6A 'reader'. Our findings reveal the key role of LINC01273 in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells, and targeting of the newly identified LINC01273\/miR-600\/METTL3 feedback regulatory axis may be a promising effective intervention for HCC patients with sorafenib resistance.","688":"Proteasome 26S non-ATPase subunit 7 (PSMD7) and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) have been found to be both upregulated in gastric cancer tissues. FOXP3 was also predicted to have binding sites on PSMD7 promoter. Thus, this study investigated the relationship between PSMD7 and FOXP3 and their roles in gastric cancer. Bioinformatic databases predicted PSMD7 expression in non-cancerous gastric tissue and gastric cancer tissue, as well as the correlation between PSMD7 and the overall\/disease free survival. PSMD7 expression in non-cancerous gastric tissue or cells and gastric cancer tissue or cells was detected by qPCR and Western blot. After PSMD7 downregulation by siRNA interference, cell viability, colony-forming capacity and cell apoptosis were analyzed with cell counting kit-8 assay, colony formation assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end-labeling. Proliferation and apoptosis markers were assayed by qPCR and Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to look at the binding relationship between FOXP3 and PSMD7 promoter. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined again after co-transfection of PSMD7 siRNA plasmid and FOXP3 overexpression plasmid. PSMD7 expression was much higher in gastric cancer tissue and cell lines. Interference with PSMD7 decreased gastric cancer cell viability, inhibited their proliferation and colony formation and promoted cell apoptosis. FOXP3 was found to bind to PSMD7 promoter and activate PSMD7 expression. Overexpression of FOXP3 could rescue the effects of PSMD7 knockdown on gastric cancer cells. PSMD7 is involved in the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells and can be transcriptionally regulated by FOXP3.","689":null,"690":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have proven to inhibit a variety of pathogens.

However, it remains unclear whether CGA-N12 could effectively inhibit the growth of Candida albicans (C. albicans). Colony forming assays were used to measure minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC), and time-kill curve. Disseminated C. albicans rabbit model was established to investigate the influence of CGA-N12 on histological damage. The protein and mRNA levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) after treatment were investigated. The MIC and MFC of CGA-N12 against C. albicans was 6 mg\/mL. CGA-N12 considerably inhibited germ tube formation of C. albicans. The fungal load in the tissues and inflammatory factors in the serum were suppressed by CGA-N12. CGA-N12 significantly reduced the histological changes caused by C. albicans, and the protein and mRNA levels of SOCS1 were markedly inhibited. The inhibition effect of CGA-N12 on C. albicans and significant improvement of histological damage by CGA-N12 through microRNA-155\/SOCS1 axis were proved in this study.

Cell counting kit-8, colony formation, transwell, tube formation, flow cytometry and tumor xenograft assays were adopted to perform in vitro and in vivo experiments. The direct interaction between miR-655-3p and circ_0001955 or ACER3 was verified using dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Circ_0001955 was highly expression in HCC tissues and cells. Functionally, circ_0001955 deletion suppressed HCC tumorigenesis in vitro by suppressing cell growth, metastasis and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, circ_0001955 could competitively sponge miR-655-3p, which targeted ACER3. Besides that, miR-655-3p silencing abolished the anticancer action of circ_0001955 silencing on HCC cells. Moreover, miR-655-3p overexpression inhibited HCC cell oncogenic phenotypes mentioned above, which were attenuated by ACER3 up-regulation. Additionally, circ_0001955 knockdown also impeded HCC growth in a mouse model.

We predicted the direct interaction of TRERNA1 with microRNA (miR)-23a, which promotes granulosa apoptosis. Granulosa apoptosis is involved in premature ovarian failure (POF). This study was therefore carried out to explore the involvement of TRERNA1 and miR-23a in POF. The expression of TRERNA1 and miR-23a in POF and control groups were detected by RT-qPCRs. The subcellular locations of TRERNA1 in granulosa cell line COV434 was detected by subcellular fractionation assay. The interaction between TRERNA1 and miR-23a was predicted using IntaRNA2.0. The direct interaction between COV434 and miR-23a was explored with RNA pull-down assay. In granulosa cells, the direct interaction between TRERNA1 and miR-23a was verified by overexpression assay. Cell apoptosis assay was performed to evaluate cell apoptosis. Both TRERNA1 and miR-23a were downregulated in POF. In addition, TRERNA1 was detected in both cytoplasm and nuclear samples of granulosa cells, and directly interacted with miR-23a. TRERNA1 did not affect the expression of miR-23a in granulosa cells, while TRERNA1 suppressed the role of miR-23a in enhancing cell apoptosis.

We found that the expression of ADORA2A-AS1 was upregulated in CML. Further, knockdown of ADORA2A-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle, and enhanced imatinib sensitivity in CML cells. Besides, ADORA2A-AS1 promoted the expression of transforming growth factor-beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1) and ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2) via sponging miR-665, thereby exerting a tumor-promoting activity.

Since inflammatory plays important roles in periodontitis progression, we aimed to explore the role of NEAT1 in chronic periodontitis (CP) in vitro. We established a periodontitis cell model was established by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS)-induced periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of NEAT1, microRNA (miR)-200c-3p, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Cell viability, inflammatory factors, and protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and TRAF6 were analyzed by MTT, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot. The target relationships among NEAT1, miR-200c-3p, and TRAF6 were predicted by the StarBase\/TargetScan software, and further validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. In this research, NEAT1 is up-regulated in CP tissues and periodontitis model group. Silencing of NEAT1 and over-expression of miR-200c-3p enhanced cell viability and repressed apoptosis in the periodontitis model group. NEAT1 targets miR-200c-3p, and miR-200c-3p further targets TRAF6. MiR-200c-3p inhibitor or over-expression of TRAF6 reversed the promoting effect of NEAT1 knockdown on cell viability, and the inhibiting effects on inflammatory cytokines and cell apoptosis. Consequently, the silencing of NEAT1 inhibits inflammation and apoptosis via targeting miR-200c-3p\/TRAF6 axis, thereby contributing to alleviate the progression of CP.

Thus, the goal of this research is to determine mechanism of FOXP4-AS1 in CRC occurrence and development. Herein, a Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to assess the regulation of miR-423-5p to nucleus accumbens-associated protein 1 (NACC1) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) to FOXP4-AS1 promoter. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining was performed to detect the pathological changes of tumor tissues. Flow cytometry, cell counting kit 8, Transwell, and wound healing assays were conducted to assess apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells, respectively. The results showed that FOXP4-AS1 was highly expressed in CRC cell lines and tissues. CRC progression was promoted by the overexpression of FOXP4-AS1 in HTC116 cells and animal models. Furthermore, FOXP4-AS1 served as a molecular sponge for miR-423-5p, and NACC1 is a direct target of miR-423-5p. MiR-423-5p silencing or overexpression of NACC1 increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCT116 cells while suppressing apoptosis. We also found that the upregulation of FOXP4-AS1 was activated by ATF3 in CRC cells.

Due to the presence of high carbohydrate content, lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is the most-potential, cost-effective and sustainable substrate for production of many useful products, including lignocellulose-derived prebiotic oligosaccharides (LDOs). These have the same worthwhile properties as other common oligosaccharides, such as short chain carbohydrates digestible to the gut flora but not to humans mainly due to their resistance to the low pH and high temperature and their demand is constantly increasing mainly due to increased awareness about their potential health benefits.

Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting were performed to determine the expression of UBXN10-AS1, miR-515-5p, and Slit guidance ligand 3 (SLIT3). Cell Counting Kit-8 and wound healing scratch assays were performed to measure COAD cell proliferation and migration. A xenograft assay was performed to examine tumor growth in vivo. Luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to determine the binding interaction among miR-515-5p, UBXN10-AS1, and SLIT3. The results showed that UBXN10-AS1 and SLIT3 were expressed at low levels in COAD tissues, while miR-515-5p was expressed at high levels. UBXN10-AS1 overexpression suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. The luciferase reporter and RNA RIP assays demonstrated that UBXN10-AS1 targeted miR-515-5p, which in turn targeted SLIT3. Functionally, miR-515-5p overexpression reversed the inhibition of COAD cell proliferation and migration by UBXN10-AS1 overexpression, and SLIT3 overexpression counteracted the oncogenicity of miR-515-5p.

The cardiac function indexes, myocardial tissue damage, and oxidative stress-related factors in CHF rats were evaluated after the interference of Smurf1\/miR-129-5p\/PTEN. The targeting relationships between miR-129-5p and Smurf1 and between PTEN and Smurf1 were verified. It was found that that after modeling, cardiac functions were impaired, heart\/left ventricular\/lung weight and the myocardial structure was destroyed, and the degree of fibrosis of myocardial tissue was increased. After Smurf1 knockdown, the cardiac function, myocardial structure, and oxidative stress were improved, and the fibrosis in myocardial tissue was decreased. Smurf1 was a target of miR-129-5p. miR-129-5p could annul the protective effect of Smurf1 silencing on CHF rats. Smurf1 inhibited PTEN expression by promoting PTEN ubiquitination, while miR-129-5p enhanced PTEN expression by inhibiting Smurf1.

Paeoniflorin has been reported to alleviate hypertension, thus relieving the injury of target organ. This study aimed to investigate the role of paeoniflorin in PIH development by regulating SIRT1 in rats. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), urine protein and histopathological damage of placenta in gestational hypertension rats were, respectively, detected by noninvasive tail-artery pressure measuring instrument, BCA method and H&amp;E staining. The viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with paeoniflorin or\/and H2O2 was observed by CCK-8 assay. SIRT1 protein expression in HUVECs treated with paeoniflorin or\/and H2O2 was analyzed by Western blot. Tunel assay, wound healing assay and tube formation assay were used to detect the apoptosis, migration and tube formation of HUVECs administrated with paeoniflorin or\/and H2O2 or\/and EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor). As a result, MAP, urine protein and histopathological damage of placenta were enhanced in PIH rats, which were then alleviated by paeoniflorin. Paeoniflorin decreased the levels of sFlt-1, PlGF and VEGF in serum and placental tissues of gestational hypertension rats as well as the inflammatory response and oxidative stress. In addition, paeoniflorin promoted the expressions of SIRT1 and NO\/eNOS and inhibited the production of iNOS in gestational hypertension rats to improve vascular endothelial cell injury. However, SIRT1 inhibition could suppress the protective effects of paeoniflorin on endothelial dysfunction of H2O2-induced HUVECs. In conclusion, paeoniflorin could improve gestational hypertension development by upregulating SIRT1.","718":"An increasing number of studies have supported the critical regulatory actions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in osteosarcoma (OS). However, the detailed roles of adipogenesis regulatory factor-antisense RNA 1 (ADIRF-AS1) in OS have not been comprehensively described. Hence, we first detected ADIRF-AS1 expression in OS and evaluated its clinical significance. Functional experiments were then performed to determine the modulatory role of ADIRF-AS1 in OS progression. ADIRF-AS1 was found to be overexpressed in OS, and the overall survival of patients with OS who had high ADIRF-AS1 levels was shorter than that of those with low levels. ADIRF-AS1 knockdown led to restricted proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of OS cells and increased apoptosis. Additionally, ADIRF-AS1 downregulation impeded tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, ADIRF-AS1 acted as a competitive endogenous RNA for microRNA-761 (miR-761) that siphoned miR-761 away from its target, namely insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), leading to IRS1 overexpression. Rescue experiments showed that low levels of miR-761 or restoration of IRS1 could neutralize the effects of ADIRF-AS1 ablation in OS cells. In summary, ADIRF-AS1 exacerbates the oncogenicity of the OS cells by targeting the miR-761\/IRS1 axis. Our findings may aid in the advancement of lncRNA-directed therapeutics for OS.","719":null,"720":null,"721":"As the fourth commonest malignancy among females worldwide, cervical cancer (CC) poses a huge challenge to human health.

Thus, we investigated the roles and mechanisms of lncRNA LOXL1-AS1 in CC. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that LOXL1-AS1 downregulation inhibited tumor growth and metastasis and proliferation of CC cells. The results of RT-qPCR demonstrated that LOXL1-AS1 and ectodermal-neural cortex 1 (ENC1) expression levels were upregulated in CC cells and tissues, while microRNA-423-5p (miR-423-5p) level was downregulated. As subcellular fractionation assays, RNA pull down assays and luciferase reporter assays revealed, LOXL1-AS1 bound to miR-423-5p and miR-423-5p targeted ENC1. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, wound healing and colony formation assays demonstrated that miR-423-5p upregulation and LOXL1-AS1 downregulation inhibited CC cell proliferation and migration, while ENC1 upregulation attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-423-5p upregulation on the malignant phenotypes of CC cells. Western blotting was conducted to measure protein levels and the results showed that ENC1 knockdown inhibited the activation of ERK\/MEK pathway. In summary, the LOXL1-AS1\/miR-423-5p\/ENC1 axis accelerates CC development through the MEK\/ERK pathway.","722":null,"723":"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is defined as the most universally diagnosed class of lung cancer. Cisplatin (DDP) is an effective drug for NSCLC, but tumors are prone to drug resistance. The current study set out to evaluate the regulatory effect of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on DDP resistance in NSCLC cells. Firstly, NSCLC cells were treated with EVs, followed by detection of cell activity, IC50 values, cell proliferation and apoptosis, and Cy3-SNHG12. We observed that CAFs-EVs promoted IC50 values and cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. In addition, we learned that lncRNA SNHG12 carried by CAFs-EVs into NSCLC facilitated DDP resistance of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, ELAV like RNA binding protein 1 (HuR\/ELAVL1) binding to lncRNA SNHG12 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) was verified and RNA stability of XIAP was also verified CAFs-EVs promoted RNA stability and transcription of XIAP, while silencing HuR could partially-reverse this promoting effect. Further joint experimentation showed that silencing XIAP partially inhibited DDP resistance in NSCLC cells. Additionally, the tumor growth and the positive rate of Ki67 and HuR were detected, which showed that CAFs-oe-EVs promoted the tumor and the positive rate of Ki67, as well as the levels of lncRNA SNHG12, HuR, and XIAP in vivo. Collectively, our findings indicated that lncRNA SNHG12 carried by CAFs-EVs into NSCLC cells promoted RNA stability and XIAP transcription by binding to HuR, thus augmenting DDP resistance in NSCLC cells.","724":"Long non-coding RNA zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) has been probed in cerebral ischemia, while the regulatory mechanism of ZFAS1 in focal cerebral ischemia (FCI) via binding to microRNA (miR)-144-5p remains rarely explored. This study aims to decipher the function of ZFAS1 on FCI via sponging miR-144-5p to modulate fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7). The focal cerebral ischemia rat model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) Lentivirus vectors altering ZFAS1, miR-144-5p or FGF7 expression were injected into rats before MCAO. Then, ZFAS1, miR-144-5p, and FGF7 levels were detected, the inflammatory factor level, oxidative stress level, angiogenesis, neurological function injury and neuronal apoptosis were assessed. The binding relations among ZFAS1, miR-144-5p and FGF7 were validated. ZFAS1 and FGF7 expression was elevated, while miR-144-5p expression was reduced in FCI rats. Decreased ZFAS1 or FGF7 or enriched miR-144-5p repressed the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, while it improved angiogenesis, and neurological function recovery; while up-regulated ZFAS1 exerted opposite effects. The augmented miR-144-5p or silenced FGF7 reversed the effects of enriched ZFAS1. ZFAS1 sponged miR-144-5p that targeted FGF7. Inhibition of lncRNA ZFAS1 improves functional recovery and angiogenesis after FCI via miR-144-5p\/FGF7 axis.

In addition, Ezrin (EZR) is a member of ERM (ezrin\/Radixin\/moesin) protein family that contributes to the progression of multiple tumors. Previous studies have correlated lncRNA taurine upregulated 1 (TUG1) or Ezrin with OS. However, the correlation between lncRNA TUG1 and Ezrin in OS remains unclear. The expressions of lncRNA TUG1 and Ezrin were upregulated in OS tissues and cells determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot (WB), respectively. In addition, both lncRNA TUG1 and Ezrin promoted OS cell proliferation identified by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and clone formation assay, and enhanced OS cell invasion detected using Transwell assay for cell invasion. Moreover, lncRNA TUG1 upregulated Ezrin expression through sponging miR-377-3p determined by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and WB.

Herein, we aimed to determine how Lnc-NEAT1 promotes LP development. q-PCR, MTT, EDU and Western blotting were performed to determine that Lnc-NEAT1 facilitates LP cell proliferation and hinders cell apoptosis. LncBase database, q-PCR, GEPIA online database, Dual luciferase reporter and RIP assays were utilized to confirm that Lnc-NEAT1 sponged miR-577\/miR-1224-5p and negatively mediated CCNT2. Western blotting, MTT and EDU were used to confirm that Lnc-NEAT1 promoted LP cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis through CCNT2. Lnc-NEAT1 was highly expressed in LP, and enhanced LP cell proliferation, and it was inhibited by Lnc-NEAT1 depleting. Concerning the underlying mechanism, it was found that Lnc-NEAT1 could functionally sponge microRNA-577 (miR-577) and microRNA-1224-5p (miR-1224-5p) and up-regulate Cyclin T2 (CCNT2) in LP cells. Notably, CCNT2 knockdown blocked Lnc-NEAT1-induced LP cell proliferation, and rescued cell apoptosis, which was specifically indicated by restoration of Bax, Cleaved caspase 3 and Cleaved caspase 9.

This study aimed to explore the biological role and potential mechanism of argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) in glioma. The relative expression levels of ASS1 in glioma specimens and cell lines were calculated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. The biological functions of ASS1 were demonstrated using the 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, transwell assay, and in vivo experiments. In addition, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and luciferase reporter assays were performed to explore the molecular mechanism of ASS1 in glioma. ASS1 expression levels were found to be downregulated in glioma specimens and cell lines. Functionally, we confirmed that ASS1 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and growth both. Furthermore, we found that ASS1 was a target of N(6)-adenosine-methyltransferase-14 (METTL14)-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. Overexpression of METTL14 markedly elevated ASS1 mRNA m6A modification and suppressed ASS1 mRNA expression. We also revealed that METTL14-mediated ASS1 mRNA degradation relied on the YTH m6A RNA-binding protein 2 (YTHDF2)-dependent pathway. We confirmed that decreased ASS1 expression promoted the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in glioma, and that the METTL14\/ASS1\/YTHDF2 regulatory axis may be an effective therapeutic target for glioma.","731":"The present study attempts to explore the effective components, action targets, and potential mechanism of nightshade for colon cancer treatment. The relationship network diagram of 'traditional Chinese medicine - component - target - disease' was firstly constructed by employing network pharmacology. Experiments were conducted in vivo and in vitro to verify the influence of quercetin, the core effective component of nightshade, on colon cancer. Meanwhile, the regulatory effects of quercetin on core targets and main signaling pathways were determined. Based on the network diagram of 'traditional Chinese medicine - component - target - disease' and KEGG analysis, quercetin might exhibit certain effects on colon cancer treatment by regulating the biological behavior of core targets related to cell apoptosis in tumors including PIK3R1, PIK3CA, Akt1, and Akt2. Furthermore, quercetin has been demonstrated in vitro experiments to suppress the proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells whereas promote their apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. In vivo experiments indicate that quercetin had an antitumor effect on human colon cancer SW480 cells in nude mice bearing tumors. Furthermore, PIK3CA could bind to quercetin directly, which is validated by immunocoprecipitation. Therefore, the activation of PI3K\/AKT phosphorylation was inhibited by quercetin and moreover the expressions of apoptotic proteins caspase-3 and Bcl2-Associated X protein (BAX) were up-regulated. In conclusion, the potential mechanism of nightshade lies in the activation of the PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway inhibited by quercetin, thus promoting apoptosis of colon cancer cells for colon cancer treatment.","732":null,"733":"Psoriasis is a common chronic immune-mediated disease that often has a serious negative impact on the physical and mental health of patients. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is a drug with anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects that may be involved in the autoimmune regulation of immune diseases. However, the effects of DHA on psoriasis have not been reported comprehensively. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DHA on abnormal proliferation and inflammation of epidermal keratinocyte cells in psoriasis and its mechanism of action. IL-17A-induced human epidermal keratin-forming cells (HaCaT) were used as a model. And after induction exposure to different concentrations of DHA, CCK-8, EDU staining, wound healing and Western blotting were performed to assess cell viability, proliferation, migration, differentiation and inflammatory factors, respectively. Subsequently, agonists of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) were added and the above experiments were repeated. The results showed that DHA obviously inhibited IL-17A-induced hyperproliferation, migration and expression of inflammatory factors in HaCaT cells. Furthermore, FGFR1 was highly expressed in IL-17A-induced HaCaT cells, and DHA inhibited its expression. However, the inhibitory effect of DHA on IL-17A-induced HaCaT cells was reversed after the addition of FGFR1 agonist. In conclusion, DHA could inhibit IL-17A-induced hyperproliferation and inflammation of keratinocytes by targeting FGFR1, which also provided a new target for the treatment of psoriasis.","734":null,"735":"Essential hypertension (EH) represents a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.

The expression of CHD1L in EH patients was determined by bioinformatics analysis, and then it was silenced in AngII-induced VSMCs to detect the changes in cellular functions including proliferation, migration, invasion and phenotypic switching via CCK-8, EDU staining, wound healing, transwell and Western blot assays, respectively. Inflammation and oxidative stress were also measured by detecting related markers via commercial kits. After confirming the binding sites between forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) and CHD1L and their negative association by bioinformatics analysis, FOXO3a was further silenced, and the cellular functions were assessed again to reveal the underlying mechanism. Results showed that CHD1L was highly expressed in EH, and interference of CHD1L suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and phenotypic switching in VSMCs. Inflammation and oxidative stress were also restrained by CHD1L knockdown. After validating the negative role of FOXO3a in regulating CHD1L, it was found that FOXO3a abrogated the effect of CHD1L knockdown on the cellular functions of AngII-induced VSMCs.

Experiments were herein conducted to study the role of ZNF267 in DLBCL. real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting assays were conducted to detect the expression of ZNF267 in tissues and cells. Tissue microarray and bioinformatics analyses of public data were also done to detect the expression status and clinical significance of ZNF267. Functional cell experiments including CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU) assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, transwell assay, and wound healing assay were conducted to study the effects of ZNF267 knockdown and overexpression on cell proliferation and mobility. Xenograft assay was also conducted to confirm the effects of ZNF267 knockdown in vivo. In the present study, we found ZNF267 was significantly upregulated in DLBCL and predicted a poor survival outcome based on the bioinformatics analysis. Functionally, the knockdown of ZNF267 resulted in less cell proliferation and mobility, whereas the overexpression led to enhanced cell proliferation and mobility. Animal experiments also confirmed that ZNF267 silence contributed to less tumor growth and less lung metastasis. Further analysis showed that ZFN267 knockdown resulted in decreased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Our results suggest that ZNF267 is an oncogene in DLBCL and its silence could compromise the aggression of DLBCL, which makes ZNF267 a promising therapeutic target.","738":null,"739":null,"740":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly vascularized solid tumor with a fast growth rate.

The online databases TCGA and CCLE were used to analyze the expression level of CCL23, and its expression was also measured in HCC cell lines by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The STRING database and co-immunoprecipitation were employed to evaluate the association between CCL23 and transcription factor activating enhancer binding protein 4 (TFAP4). Overexpression plasmids for CCL23 (Ov-CCL23) and TFAP4 (Ov-TFAP4) were transfected into Huh-7 cells to detect TFAP4 expression. Huh-7 cells injected with OV-negative control (NC)\/Ov-CCL23 or OV-NC\/Ov-CCL23 plus Ov-TFAP4 were utilized to study the function of CCL23\/TFAP4. Cell proliferation, invasion and human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assays were conducted. The database revealed decreased expression of CCL23 in HCC and that it was commonly downregulated in HCC cell lines. TFAP4 expression was negatively correlated with CCL23. The overexpression of CCL23 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of Huh-7 cells, whereas TFAP4 blocked these effects. Similarly, the supernatant of CCL23-upregulated cells exhibited significantly lower tube formation potential, and low vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGFRs expression compared with those of non-transfected Huh-7 cells, while TFAP4 plasmid co-transfected markedly increased these. Taken together, the present study suggests that CCL23 is expressed at low levels in HCC; it inhibits HCC cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis in vitro; and its action is negatively associated with and can be blocked by TFAP4.","741":null,"742":null,"743":"Aging could be critical in limiting the application of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in tissue repair and reconstruction. However, no systematic study on the characteristics of SAT aging has been conducted. In this study, a scanning electronic microscope was used to detect the structural and compositional changes of SAT collected from nine females in three age groups. Multi-omics data of SAT from 37 females were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database, and 1860 genes, 56 miRNAs, and 332 methylated genes were identified as being differentially expressed during aging among non-obese females. Using Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), 1754 DEGs were defined as aging-associated genes for non-obese females, distributed among ten co-expression modules. Through Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Gene Set enrichment analysis on those aging-associated DEGs, SAT aging was observed to be characterized by variations in immune and inflammatory states, mitochondria, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and regulation of vascular development. SUPV3L1, OGT, and ARPC1B were identified as conserved and core SAT-aging-related genes, as verified by RT-qPCR among 18 samples in different age groups. Multi-omics regulatory networks of core aging-associated biological processes of SAT were also constructed. Based on WGCNA, we performed differential co-expression analysis to unveil the differences in aging-related co-expression patterns between obese and non-obese females and determined that obesity could be an important accelerating factor in aging processes.

However, the roles of pyroptosis-related (PR) genes (PRGs) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) remain elusive. In the present study, we constructed a novel PR risk signature through the lasso regression analysis. The risk signature was greatly conducive to PAAD prognostic assessment. PR risk score was identified as an independent prognostic factor and could distinguish the prognostic differences of most clinical subgroups. Meanwhile, it could improve the traditional prognostic models based on TNM-staging. Next, its prognostic value was also tested in five validation cohorts. Using CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and ssGSEA algorithms, the effects of PR risk signature on tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) were explored. High PR risk suppressed antitumor immune through decreasing the infiltrating levels of CD8 T and NK cells. The genomic information and histological expression of risk PRGs were uncovered by USCA and HPA databases. Somatic mutation, methylation alteration, and homozygous CNV of eight PRGs barely occurred in PAAD samples. As for therapeutic correlation, PR risk score may not predict the efficacy of PD-1\/L1 inhibitors and was weakly associated with multiple drug susceptibilities. Finally, the biofunctions of toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) in pancreatic cancer (PC) cells were investigated through qPCR, MTT, colony formation, and Transwell assays. Overexpression of TLR3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC cells. In conclusion, PRGs play crucial roles in prognosis, progression, and immune microenvironment of PAAD. TLR3 is expected to be a promising therapeutic target.","745":"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has increased morbidity and mortality rate worldwide.

Furthermore, the core proteins (p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, and AKT) levels of the PI3K\/AKT signaling cascade were investigated via immunoblotting. Finally, we tested the functional role of circ_0017639 by examining its regulation of xenograft tumor growths in nude mice in vivo. Circ_0017639 expression was remarkably high in the NSCLC tissues and cell lines.

The effects of CCL2 and miR-128 were measured via Luciferase reporter test. Western blot was used to check PARP2 protein expression. CCL2 expression and PARP2 protein levels were up-regulated, while miR-128 expression was obviously lower. Meanwhile, CCL2 down-regulating significantly repressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating miR-128. In addition, we proved miR-128 was a direct target of CCL2 through double luciferase assay and bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, miR-128 markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion in gastric cancer. More importantly, miR-128 could reverse the effects of lncRNA CCL2 knocked down. PARP2-si obviously suppressed in gastric cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion. Meanwhile, miR-128 mimic and the knockout of CCL2 distinctly decreased PARP2 protein level. Additionally, luciferase report experiments certificated that PARP2 targeted miR-128, implying PARP2 directly interacted with miR-128 in gastric cancer. More interestingly, the downregulation of PARP could reverse the trend triggered by miR-128 inhibitor in gastric tumor. All over these results showed lncRNA CCL2 played importance of role in gastric tumor via miR-128\/PARP2 axis signal pathway.

The mRNA and protein expression levels of microRNA-9-5p (miR-9-5p) and chemokine CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4) were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using the cell counting kit-8 and Hoechst staining kits. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein, and caspase-3 were detected by Western blotting analysis. These results confirmed that propofol activated cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. A significant increase in the miR-9-5p and CXCR4 expression was observed in the propofol-treated cells. The overexpression of miR-9-5p induced apoptosis in NSCs, accompanied by elevated apoptosis-related protein activity. Furthermore, mitigated CXCR4 expression reduced propofol-induced cell apoptosis.

Ramelteon treatment also activated the Nrf2\/HO-1 signaling pathway in LPS-induced HPMECs. Furthermore, the addition of ML385 or SnPP reversed the protective effects of ramelteon on LPS-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and cell dysfunction in HPMECs. Collectively, the results suggested that ramelteon alleviated LPS-induced HPMEC damage by activating the Nrf2\/HO-1 signaling pathway, making it an effective treatment for ALI.","759":"Xiaoyao Powder (XYP) has been widely applied in China to treat stress-related illnesses, such as migraine, depression, Parkinson's disease, insomnia, and hypertension. Herein, this study aims to explore the effect of XYP on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression and its underlying mechanisms. CUMS-induced depression rat models were established, they were subsequently randomly divided and treated with various conditions. Results of this study indicated that supplementation of XYP observably abolished CUMS-induced hippocampal damage and serum corticosterone (CORT) elevation. In mechanism, we discovered that CUMS induction could cause a prominent downregulation in glucocorticoid receptor (GR), phosphorylated-GR (p-GR), connexin 43 (Cx43), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a remarkable upregulation in c-Src. While the introduction of XYP could reverse the changes in all of these indicators mediated by CUMS. Furthermore, we proved that Cx43 could interact with GR, and the protective effect of XYP on hippocampal neurons is realized by up-regulating GR. Summarized, this study indicated that XYP could ameliorate hippocampal neuron damage in CUMS-induced depression model rats through acting on Cx43\/GR\/BDNF axis.","760":"Long noncoding RNA muskelin 1 antisense RNA (MKLN1-AS) acted as an oncogenic regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was performed to investigate the functional mechanism of MKLN1-AS. MKLN1-AS, microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) and ETS Proto-Oncogene 1 (ETS1) levels were examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase-chain reaction. Protein expression was detected by Western blot. The target relation was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay and RNA pull-down assay. Cell proliferation ability was determined through cell counting kit-8 assay, colony formation assay and ethylenediurea assay. Angiogenesis was examined by tube formation assay. Cell migration and invasion were assessed via transwell assay. In vivo research was conducted by xenograft tumor model in nude mice. MKLN1-AS was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. ETS1 promoted the ETS1 expression by binding to the 582-596 sites. Silence of MKLN1-AS suppressed cell growth, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion. MKLN1-AS interacted with miR-22-3p in HCC cells. The function of MKLN1-AS downregulation was relieved by miR-22-3p inhibition in HCC cells. ETS1 was validated as a target of miR-22-3p, and MKLN1-AS upregulated the ETS1 expression by sponging miR-22-3p. Overexpression of miR-22-3p retarded HCC progression by downregulating the level of ETS1. Tumor growth in vivo was also enhanced by MKLN1-AS through the regulation of miR-22-3p\/ETS1 axis. These data demonstrated that ETS1-mediated MKLN1-AS contributed to the malignant phenotypes of HCC cells via depending on the miR-22-3p\/ETS1 regulatory axis.","761":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies in the digestive system. Abnormal miR-373-3p and TFAP4 expressions are critical in many malignant tumors, but it is unclear whether they work in the context of HCC. qRT-PCR measured miR-373-3p expression in HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues.

DEP domain containing 1B (DEPDC1B) expression has been found to be upregulated in HCC according to bioinformatics analysis. This paper sought to study the specific role of DEPDC1B in HCC. The data of DEPDC1B expression and individual overall survival in HCC and normal liver tissues were acquired from UALCAN database. The association between DEPDC1B and the downstream signal, kinesin family member 23 (KIF23), was determined using LinkedOmics and STRING database, and subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay. The expression levels of DEPDC1B and KIF23 in normal hepatic epithelial cells and HCC cell lines were assessed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. Following transfection with small interference RNA-DEPDC1B, the influences of DEPDC1B knockdown on cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, cell invasion, migration, and KIF23 expression were evaluated. In addition, the effects of KIF23 overexpression on the above aspects of HCC cells were also determined, as well as the expression level of p53 signaling-related proteins.

The logic gate can integrate multiple input signals following a set of algorithms and generate a response only if strictly defined conditions are met. However, there are still some logic gates that have not been implemented but are necessary to build complex genetic circuits. Here, based on the toehold switches and three-way-junction (3WJ) repressors, we designed two novel biological Boolean logic gates of IMPLICATION (IMP) and XOR. Subsequently, the outputs of these two logic gates were characterized by fluorescence analysis, indicating that they can achieve the truth tables of logical gates. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity under the logical TRUE condition was significantly higher than under the logical FALSE condition, suggesting the high dynamic range of the ON\/OFF ratios.

Flow cytometry was performed to analyze cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Cell glycolytic metabolism was analyzed using Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay kit, Lactate Assay Kit II, and ATP colorimetric Assay kit. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were performed to verify the interaction between microRNA-515-5p (miR-515-5p) and circ-LARP1B or TPX2 microtubule nucleation factor (TPX2). Circ-LARP1B expression was up-regulated in CSCC tissues and cell lines. Circ-LARP1B knockdown suppressed cell viability, colony formation ability, migration, invasion, cell cycle progression, and glycolysis and triggered cell apoptosis in CSCC cells. miR-515-5p was a direct target of circ-LARP1B in CSCC cells, and circ-LARP1B silencing-mediated anti-tumor effects were largely counteracted by miR-515-5p knockdown. miR-515-5p directly interacted with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of TPX2. TPX2 overexpression largely overturned miR-515-5p-mediated anti-tumor effects in CSCC cells. Circ-LARP1B could up-regulate TPX2 expression by sponging miR-515-5p in CSCC cells. Circ-LARP1B knockdown suppressed tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, circ-LARP1B contributed to CSCC progression by targeting miR-515-5p\/TPX2 axis.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective role of FOXC1 during GDM and the underlying mechanism. FOXC1 was downregulated in GDM placental tissues and HG-treated HTR-8\/SVneo cells. Overexpression of FOXC1 prevented HG-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. FOXC1 suppressed HG-induced cell apoptosis in HTR-8\/SVneo cells. The apoptosis-related proteins: cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and BAX, were also downregulated by FOXC1 overexpression. FOXC1 increased glucose uptake and improved insulin sensitivity. The expression of FOXC1 was positively correlated with FGF19 expression. FOXC1 regulated the expression of FGF19 and phosphorylation of AMPK. Inhibition of FGF19 attenuated the biological functions of FOXC1 through inactivation of AMPK. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FOXC1 attenuates HG-induced trophoblast cell injury through upregulating FGF19 to activate the AMPK signaling pathway during GDM, suggesting that FOXC1 is a potential therapeutic target for drug discovery in the future.","769":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) commonly have aggressive properties. microRNA-582-5p (miR-582-5p) modulates the progression of several cancers. Yet, the role of miR-582-5p in TNBC progression is undetermined. In the current study, we investigated miR-582-5p expression levels and clinical significance in TNBC. The impact of miR-582-5p modulation on the biological behaviors of TNBC cells were measured. The downstream gene(s) regulated by miR-582-5p in TNBC was explored. We showed that compared to adjacent normal breast tissues, the miR-582-5p level was elevated in TNBC samples. The upregulation of miR-582-5p correlated with lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of miR-582-5p enhanced TNBC cell migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of miR-582-5p had an adverse impact on aggressive phenotype. In vivo xenograft mouse studies demonstrated that miR-582-5p overexpression accelerated TNBC growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, miR-582-5p selectively inhibited CMTM8, leading to a reduction of CMTM8 expression. CMTM8 showed suppressive effects on TNBC cell migration and invasion. Rescue experiments revealed that overexpression of CMTM8 impaired miR-582-5p-induced migration and invasion in TNBC cells.

The expression levels of lncRNA MEG3, miR-6720-5p, and cytochrome B5 reductase 2 (CYB5R2) in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMECs) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), transwell migration, and tube formation assays were used to determine the cell viability, migration, and tube formation ability of hRMECs, respectively. The interaction of MEG3, miR-6720-5p, and CYB5R2 was detected and explored by a luciferase assay. The expression of MEG3 and CYB5R2 was upregulated and that of miR-6720-5p was downregulated in patients with DR and hRMECs treated with high glucose. Knocking down MEG3 or CYB5R2 promoted proliferation, migration, and neovascularization in hRMECs. The intervention of miR-6720-5p reversed the effect of MEG3 knockdown on hRMEC function, and this effect was eliminated by silencing CYB5R2. Therefore, MEG3 acted as a sponge to suppress miR-6720-5p and regulate the expression of CYB5R2, thereby inhibiting DR neovascularization.","771":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study explored the role of lncRNA LINC01194, which is upregulated in HCC tissues and might be a vital regulator in HCC progression. Levels of LINC01194, microRNA (miR)-655-3p, and SMAD family member 5 (SMAD5) were assessed using reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The bioactivity of Huh-7 cells was assessed using cell counting kit-8 and transwell assays and flow cytometry. Western blotting was conducted to measure the expression of invasion- and apoptosis-related proteins. The relationships between lncRNA LINC01194 and miR-655-3p, and miR-655-3p and SMAD5 were predicted using StarBase and TargetScan, and further verified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. LINC01194 was overexpressed in HCC cells and in clinical samples. ILINC01194 silencing suppressed proliferation and migration; however, it promoted apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also confirmed that miR-655-3p could bind to LINC01194, and miR-655-3p was downregulated in HCC. The upregulation of miR-655-3p suppressed HCC cell invasion and migration, and enhanced the number of apoptotic cells. SMAD5, which was overexpressed in HCC cell lines, was directly targeted by miR-655-3p. Therefore, LINC01194 promoted HCC development by decreasing miR-655-3p expression and may serve as a promising therapeutic target for HCC patients.","772":"We aimed to assess the regulatory effects of miR-28 on the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs). HBMMSCs isolated, cultured and induced (at P3) to undergo osteogenic induction. The expressions of miRNAs were detected by gene microarray, and differentially expressed miRNAs in hBMMSCs compared with induced cells were obtained by significance analysis of microarrays. The microarray findings were confirmed by RT-PCR. TargetScan showed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) was the downstream target gene of miR-28. The relationship between miR-28 and STAT1 was validated using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. HBMMSCs were transfected with miR-28 mimics and STAT1 siRNA, respectively. Samples were collected on day 10 after osteogenic differentiation, and the alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2, a key regulator of osteogenic differentiation) and STAT1 expressions were determined using kits, PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Cell proliferation and migration were detected through CCK-8 and Transwell assays, respectively. During the osteogenic differentiation of hBMMSCs, the expression level of miR-28 increased. MiR-28 specifically bound the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of STAT1 mRNA. It inhibited STAT1 expression in a targeted manner during osteogenic differentiation. Interference with STAT1 partially mimicked the regulatory effects of miR-28 overexpression on the osteogenic differentiation of hBMMSCs. Interference with STAT1 or overexpression of miR-28 did not affect proliferation or migration. MiR-28 has gradually increased expression during the osteogenic differentiation of hBMMSCs, which can directly bind STAT1 3'UTR and inhibit its expression, thereby up-regulating AKP and RUNX2, and promoting osteogenic differentiation.","773":null,"774":"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in females and poses a significant health threat to women. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPPA) is highly expressed in pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) tissues.

We first examined the expression level of PAPPA in PABC tissue and breast cancer cell lines using quantitative real-time polymerase-chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Next, the functional role of PAPPA in breast cancer cells was validated by overexpression and knockdown experiments. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) proliferation assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, wound healing and transwell invasion assay were used to examine cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ability. We further identified the microRNA target regulating PAPPA and studied its functional role. Finally, we examined the impact of PAPPA on the tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer in mice model. Our study revealed that PAPPA was upregulated in PABC tissues and breast cancer cells. Overexpression of PAPPA promoted cell proliferation, motility, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We further identified miR-497-5p as a negative regulator of PAPPA, which suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in breast cancer cells.

Here, we constructed PSMA-knockdown LNCaP and 22rv1 cell lines and performed metabonomic and transcriptomic analyses to determine the effects of PSMA on PCa metabolism and transcription. The metabolism of arginine and proline was detected using specific kits. The mRNA and protein expression levels of the identified differentially expressed genes were quantified by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The proliferation of each cell line was evaluated through CCK-8, EdU and colony formation assays. The migration and invasion abilities of each cell line were detected using wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. PSMA knockdown led to metabolic disorder and abnormal transcription in PCa and resulted in inhibition of the proliferation and metastasis of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. The depletion of PSMA also promoted the biosynthesis of arginine and proline, inhibited the expression of AR and PSA, and induced the expression of c-Fos and FosB.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of HIF1A and angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) in H9c2 cells. Cell viability and apoptosis were, respectively, estimated by Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) and TUNEL assays. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, inflammation and oxidative stress were in turn detected by their commercial assay kits. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were used to confirm the association between HIF1A and ANGPTL2 promoter. The expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)\/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway-related proteins and apoptosis-related proteins were also detected by Western blot analysis. As a result, ANGPTL2 expression was upregulated in H9c2 cells induced by HG or\/and H\/R. ANGPTL2 positively modulated HIF1A expression in H9c2 cells. HG or\/and H\/R suppressed the cell viability and promoted apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress levels in H9c2 cells. However, the knockdown of ANGPTL2 could reverse the above phenomena in H\/R-stimulated-H9c2 cells through activation of Nrf2\/HO-1 pathway. HIF1A transcriptionally activated ANGPTL2 expression. The effect of knockdown of ANGPTL2 on H\/R triggered-H9c2 cells was weakened by HIF1A overexpression.

In this study, it was found that HOXA11-AS expression was upregulated in cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant LSCC tissues and cells. Loss-of-function assays revealed that HOXA11-AS knockdown inhibited the viability, migration, and invasion, but promoted the apoptosis of CDDP-resistant LSCC cells. Meanwhile, we identified miR-518a as a downstream gene of HOXA11-AS in LSCC, and miR-518a silencing reversed the promotive effect of HOXA11-AS knockdown on CDDP sensitivity of LSCC cells. In addition, miR-518a could inhibit spermatogenesis-associated serine-rich 2-like (SPATS2L) expression by direct interaction, and upregulation of SPATS2L abrogated the inhibitory effect of HOXA11-AS silencing or miR-518a overexpression on CDDP resistance of CDDP-resistant LSCC cells.

Mice and H9c2 cardiomyocyte cells were subjected to cardiomyocyte I\/R injury and hypoxia\/reoxygenation (H\/R) injury, respectively. The roles and mechanisms of DEX on H9c2 cardiomyocyte cells and mice cardiomyocyte cells exposured to H\/R or I\/R injury were explored. The results showed that DEX attenuates H\/R injury-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis and alleviated mitochondrial oxidative stress; it also reduced myocardial infarct size and protected the cardiac function following cardiomyocyte I\/R injury. In addition, H\/R and I\/R injury increased p53 expression and forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a)\/p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) signaling in H9c2 cardiomyocyte cells and cardiomyocytes. Targeting p53 expression or FOXO3a\/PUMA signaling inhibited cell apoptosis and protected against H\/R injury in H9c2 cardiomyocyte cells and cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment with DEX reduced the H\/R or I\/R injury-induced activation of p53 expression and FOXO3a\/PUMA signaling, and alleviated H\/R or I\/R injury-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial oxidative stress.

In addition, LCN2 silencing repressed LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro, as well as apoptosis. Meanwhile, decreased level of Fe2+ and transferrin while increased levels of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) were observed. The expression MAPK\/ERK pathway was inhibited by depletion of LCN2. The present results suggest that LCN2 knockdown protected LPS-induced ARDS model via inhibition of ferroptosis-related inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting the MAPK\/ERK pathway, thereby presenting a novel target for the treatment of ARDS.","792":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a kind of malignant tumor derived from hepatocytes and hepatobiliary cells, and its occurrence is prevalent worldwide. Although medical technology is developing rapidly, the therapeutic efficacy of HCC is still poor. Emerging evidence manifests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in various cancers and have been regarded as cancer suppressor gene. However, the regulatory mechanisms mediated by miR-647 involved in HCC remain unclear. Hence, to clarify the regulatory mechanisms mediated by miR-647 in HCC, we studied the independent effects of miR-647 and explored protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) in the constructed HCC cell line (HCV-huh7.5). Thereafter, we used dual-luciferase gene reporting and Western blot to investigate the relationship between PTPRF and miR-647. Furthermore, we studied the mechanism of miR-647 on PTPRF in HCV-huh7.5. We found that miR-647 could not only promote the proliferation and invasion of HCV-huh7.5 cells but also facilitate cell migration, while PTPRF has the opposite effect. Besides, the results of cell function experiment implied that the overexpression of miR-647 or inhibition of PTPFRF remarkably influenced the Erk signaling pathway, which could regulate cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, the dual luciferase reporting identified PTPRF as a direct target of miR-647. We further demonstrated that miR-647 inhibitor or PTPRF knockdown administration boosted HCV-huh7.5 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by targeting PTPRF.These findings provided clues for the mechanism of miR-647 in promoting the biology of HCV-huh7.5 cells by inhibiting the expression level of PTPRF.","793":null,"794":"We aimed to explore the relationships between the plasma expression levels of microRNA (miR)-146a and miR-132 in epileptic patients and cognitive, mental and psychological disorders. Eighty epileptic patients and seventy healthy subjects as controls were evaluated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Anxiety Rating (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating (HAMD) scales, and plasma samples were collected. MiR-146a and miR-132 levels were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The total incidence rate of cognitive dysfunction, anxiety and depression in epilepsy group was 62.5%. Cognitive dysfunction was correlated positively with educational level, but negatively with disease course, duration and type of administration. The frequency and duration of seizures were positively correlated with anxiety. Depression was correlated negatively with educational level, whereas positively with course of disease and number of used drugs. Epileptic patients had significantly higher miR-146a and miR-132 levels than those of healthy controls. The miR-146a and miR-132 levels of patients with complications were significantly higher than those of cases without complications. Their expressions were correlated negatively with total MoCA scale score, but positively with type of complications. MiR-132 expression was positively correlated with the total scores of HAMA and HAMD scales. Plasma miR-146a and miR-132 expressions increased in epileptic patients, and miR-132 expression reflected the severity of epilepsy and predicted the risks of complications.","795":null,"796":null,"797":null,"798":null,"799":null,"800":null,"801":null,"802":null,"803":null,"804":"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease with a complex physio-pathology. So far, there is no effective medical strategies to prevent the progression of Parkinson's disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the progression of Parkinson's disease could provide insights into the formulation of novel preventative or treatment strategies. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 10 (SNHG10) is a lncRNA which has been implicated in the development of many cancers. However, its potential role in Parkinson's disease remains unknown. In this study, we found that SNHG10 was upregulated while miR-1277-5p was downregulated in the Parkinson's disease cell model of 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-pyridine ion (MPP+) induced SH-SY5Y cells. We further revealed that SNHG10 sponged miR-1277-5p to negatively regulate its expression, and miR-1277-5p could bind to the 3'UTR of insulin substrate receptor 2 (IRS2) mRNA to suppress its expression. These data suggest that SNHG10 regulates IRS2 through interacting with miR-1277-5p in the cell model of Parkinson's disease. Through a series of molecular experiments and functional assays, we demonstrated that downregulating SNHG10 in the cell model of Parkinson's disease attenuated the cell injury by reducing the expression of IRS2. Meanwhile, inhibiting miR-1277-5p or overexpressing IRS2 could partially reverse the effect of SNHG10 knockdown. In summary, our data indicate that knockdown of SNHG10 mitigates MPP+ induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells via the miR-1277-5p\/IRS2 axis.","805":null,"806":"Circ_0005320 was found to be elevated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and accelerated OSCC progression.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of OC remain unclear. Here, we report that loss of Ras GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) inhibits the progression of OC cells. Analysis of databases and clinical specimens showed that G3BP1 is upregulated in OC. The Kaplan-Meier plot results showed that G3BP1 is highly expressed in OC with a poor clinical outcome. Moreover, loss-of-G3BP1 suppresses the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells. Protein-protein interaction network analysis and immunoprecipitation assay showed that ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) interacts with G3BP1. We next found that USP10 coordinately promotes tumor progression with G3BP1. Moreover, loss of USP10could restore the G3BP1-induced proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells.

This study focuses on elucidating the function of lncRNA DCST1-AS1 in CRC development and its underlying mechanism. We found that the expression of lncRNA DCST1-AS1 was up-regulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, and CRC patients with high lncRNA DCST1-AS1 expression were associated with a poor prognosis. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiment in CRC cell lines confirmed that lncRNA DCST1-AS1 promoted the malignant phenotype of CRC cells, including cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. In addition, we identified the binding sites between lncRNA DCST1-AS1 and hsa-miR-582-5p, and between hsa-miR-582-5p and High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) through DIANA Tools and TargetScan database, which was further confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay.

However, the mechanism of reversine and miR-21-5p has not been fully investigated in HBC. The aim of the current study was to assess the mechanism of action of reversine, with or without miR-21-5p, in HBC progression. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot results confirmed the upregulation of miR-21-5p and downregulation of sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 2 (SPRY2) in HBC. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay identified the correlation between miR-21-5p and SPRY2. Cell function experiment results indicated a decrease in migration, proliferation, and invasion of HBC cells treated with miR-21-5p inhibitor and reversine; however, an increase in apoptosis was observed in these cells. Apoptotic ability was more enhanced and migration, proliferation, and invasion were more impaired in HBC cells treated with both miR-21-5p inhibitor and reversine than in those treated individually with either inhibitors. SPRY2, downstream of miR-21-5p, participated in HBC progression with reversine. Overall, our study proved that combining the miR-21-5p inhibitor with reversine produced a synergistic effect by regulating SPRY2, thereby limiting HBC progression.

Western blotting was applied for the detection of protein levels. Pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations, cardiomyocyte viability, and apoptosis were detected via ELISA, CCK-8 and flow cytometry. In the in vitro model, SOX2-OT and YY1 were both upregulated, while miR-186-5p was downregulated. SOX2-OT knockdown attenuated oxygen-glucose deprivation\/reoxygenation (OGD\/R)-induced cardiomyocyte dysregulation through relieving inflammation, promoting proliferation, and reducing apoptosis in OGD\/R-treated H2C9 cells.

However, its influence on OC progression and the underlying mechanism is still not well demonstrated. Here, we found that UBA6-AS1 directly associated with UBA6 mRNA and inhibited its decay. Further mechanism investigation revealed that UBA6-AS1 increased the m6A methylation of UBA6 mRNA via recruiting RNA binding motif protein 15 (RBM15). Insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) was identified as the m6A reader protein of UBA6-AS1-RBM15-mediated m6A modification of UBA6 mRNA, which enhanced the stability of UBA6 mRNA. Functionally, UBA6-AS1 suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of OC cells via UBA6. Moreover, UBA6-AS1 positively correlated with UBA6 expression in OC tissues.

Suppressing apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells was shown to alleviate functional damage of lung, and modulator of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis becomes a promising approach to the ALI therapy. Previous little studies showed that DHCR24 possessed anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic property in ALI. Thus, H2O2 was utilized to mimic oxidative damage in vitro in alveolar epithelial cell line A549 in the present study. Our results exhibited that H2O2 treatment of A549 cells reduced the level of SOD and increased the level of ROS. Moreover, H2O2 inhibited Bcl-2 expression in A549 cells, but increased Bax and the activity of Caspase-3. In addition, the apoptosis rate in the H2O2 treatment group also increased significantly. And the expression of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) was markedly reduced in the H2O2 treatment group. Overexpression of DHCR24 can remarkably inhibit H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. We found that overexpression of DHCR24 increased the phosphorylation level of PI3K and AKT, however, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY) eliminated the protective effect of DHCR24 in ALI. DHCR24 was down-regulated in H2O2-induced ALI, and overexpression of DHCR24 could inhibit H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of A549 cells by activating the Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase\/Protein Kinase B (PI3K\/AKT) signaling pathway.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this connection are poorly understood. Hence, the present work aimed to examine the possible mechanisms which may be useful in identifying a potential therapeutic strategy. The differential expression of TOP2A mRNA in HCC as compared with adjacent normal tissue was analyzed using the Oncomine database. The expression levels of TOP2A in HCC specimens and cell lines were assessed by Western blot and RT-qPCR. Stable cell lines were generated to knockdown or overexpress TOP2A, and then cell growth, migration, and invasion were analyzed. Furthermore, this study examined epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as the activation of related pathways. Additionally, the correlation between TOP2A levels and E-cadherin\/Snail expression was determined in 72 HCC specimens. Higher expression levels of TOP2A were observed in HCC in Oncomine datasets, and the results were verified using 40 pairs of HCC specimens and peritumoral tissues. TOP2A expression levels were remarkably elevated in cells with great metastatic capacity. In addition, HCC cell growth, migration, and invasion were suppressed after TOP2A knockdown in MHCC97H cells (MHCC97H-shRNA-TOP2A), while these capabilities were promoted in TOP2A-overexpressing Hep3B cells (Hep3B-TOP2A). Furthermore, EMT was inhibited in MHCC97H-shRNA-TOP2A cells, but induced in Hep3B-TOP2A cells. The induction of EMT by TOP2A was shown to be mediated by Snail, as TOP2A promoted Snail expression through the p-ERK1\/2\/p-SMAD2 signaling pathway. TOP2A level showed a negative correlation with E-cadherin, whereas a positive correlation with that of vimentin and Snail in human HCC specimens by immunohistochemistry analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that TOP2A upregulation showed a positive correlation with poor prognosis patients. Taken together, TOP2A possibly enhances the metastasis of HCC by promoting EMT through the mediation of the p-ERK1\/2\/p-SMAD2\/Snail pathway. This indicates that TOP2A maybe a potential factor to predict the prognosis of HCC.","832":"Cervical cancer (CC) ranks as the second most frequent tumor in women, and CC stem cells have been vital in the tumorigenesis of CC.

After knockdown of MACC1 or\/and Colivelin treatment, cell migration, invasion, apoptosis, and stemness were evaluated through a series of functional experiments including Transwell, flow cytometry, Hoechst staining, and sphere-formation assays. MACC1 was found to express more highly in CC tissues in comparison with corresponding non-tumor tissues at both mRNA and protein levels. Functionally, the knocking- down of MACC1 significantly repressed migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis of CC cells. Also, knockdown of MACC1 was discovered to suppress sphere-formation of CC cells and downregulate OCT4 and Nanog. It was proved that knockdown of MACC1 had a significant blocking effect on the AKT\/STAT3 pathway. In addition, we verified that treatment with the STAT3 activator (Colivelin) had significant reversal effects on the malignant behaviors of CC cells and CC stemness.

Fluvastatin suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of EC cells, but induced the apoptosis. The expression of SIRT6 was elevated in EC cells upon fluvastatin exposure. After silencing SIRT6 in fluvastatin-treated EC cells, the proliferation, migration, and invasion were promoted whereas the apoptosis was decreased. To sum up, this study firstly evidenced that fluvastatin suppresses the proliferation, invasion, and migration and promotes the apoptosis of endometrial cancer cells by regulating SIRT6 expression.","842":"The ubiquitin hydrolase OTUB1 has been elucidated to be highly expressed in tumors, however, its roles in glioma progression are still confusing. Here, via analyzing several online datasets, OTUB1 expression was shown to be remarkably increased in glioma tissues compared to that in the adjacent tissues, and predicted a poor overall survival of glioma patients. Then OTUB1 was knocked down in glioma cells and it was found that OTUB1 knockdown significantly reduced glioma cell stemness by detecting sphere-formation ability, stemness marker expression, and ALDH activity. Mechanistic experiments revealed that OTUB1 stabilized SLC7A11 protein via directly interacting with SLC7A11, which is a key suppressor of ferripotosis. Indeed, OTUB1 knockdown triggered ferroptosis dependent on SLC7A11 expression. Notably, ectopic expression of SLC7A11 attenuated the inhibition of OTUB1 knockdown on the stemenss of glioma cells. Finally, we found a positive correlation between OTUB1 and SLC7A11 expression in clinical samples. Taken together, this work identifies a novel OTUB1\/SLC7A11 axis contributing to glioma cell stemness.","843":null,"844":null,"845":"The aim of this study was to determine the diversity of intestinal microflora and its correlation with clinical parameters in diabetic patients and healthy subjects and to assess the importance of intestinal flora in patients with diabetes. Forty-four patients with diabetes were included. The control group included 47 healthy people. Their data, biochemical indicators and results from 16S rRNA sequencing of their fecal samples were collected. Compared with the healthy population, the intestinal flora of the diabetic patients was obviously abnormal. Within the diabetes group, the abundances of the genera Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, and Roseburia were higher, and the abundances of the genera Shigella and Bifidobacterium were lower. In the correlation analysis between bacteria and clinical indicators, it was found that the genera Veillonella and unclassified_Enterobacteriaceae were negatively related to blood glucose, while the genera Phascolarctobacterium, unidentified_Bacteroidales and Prevotella were significantly positively correlated with fasting blood glucose. Twelve microbial markers were detected in the random forest model, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 84.1%. This index was greater than the diagnostic effect of fasting blood glucose. This was also supported by the joint diagnostic model of microorganisms and clinical indicators. In addition, the intestinal flora significantly improved the diagnosis of diabetes. In conclusion, it can be concluded from these results that intestinal flora is essential for the occurrence and development of diabetes, which seems to be as important as blood glucose itself.Abbreviations: PCoA: principal coordinate analysis; NMDS: non econometric multidimensional scaling analysis; LEfSe: linear discriminant analysis effect size; LDA: linear discriminant analysis; POD: probability of disease; BMI: body mass index; DCA: decision curve analysis.","846":null,"847":null,"848":"Atherosclerosis (AS) is one of the main causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) exacerbates the development of AS. This study aimed to investigate the roles of TMAO in AS. In this study, mice were fed with high fat food (HF) and\/or injected with TMAO. Oil red O staining was applied for histological analysis. ELISA, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were conducted to determine the TMAO, serum, mRNA, and protein levels. CCK-8, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry assays were performed to detect the functions of human aortic endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results showed that TMAO induced thick internal and external walls and intimal plaques in vivo, and HUVEC dysfunction in vitro. TMAO and lncRNA enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) were increased in AS clinical samples and TMAO-HUVECs. Downregulated NEAT1 inhibited proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of HUVECs. NEAT1 regulated the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) via sponging miR-370-3p. Overexpression of miR-370-3p facilitated the effects of NEAT1 on the cellular functions of HUVECs, while STAT3 exerted opposing effects. The activation of STAT3 promoted the expression of flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 (FMO3).

This novel feedback loop may be a promising therapeutic target for AS.","849":null,"850":"Breast cancer (BC) is regarded as the major cause of cancer-associated deaths in women. Paclitaxel exerts a critical impact on the chemotherapy of BC, but the resistance to paclitaxel becomes a great obstacle in treating the disease. It is reported that noncoding RNA nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) plays a significant role in drug resistance; however, the special role of NSD1 in paclitaxel-resistant BC is unclear. Human BC cell line MCF-7 was used to establish paclitaxel-resistant BC cells (MCF-7\/PR). Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) displayed that NSD1 and F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 11 (FBXL11) were highly expressed in BC tissues. Western blotting was utilized for protein level assessment. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell, wound healing assays, and animal experiments were conducted to examine the influence of NSD1 or FBXL11 on the malignant behaviors of BC in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Transfected MCF-7\/PR cells were injected subcutaneously into BALB\/c nude mice with or without treatment of paclitaxel. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activity was evaluated by the luciferase reporter assay. Results showed that NSD1 knockdown inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasiveness of BC in vitro, which was rescued by FBXL11 overexpression. Furthermore, NSD1 silencing promoted paclitaxel sensitivity of paclitaxel-resistant BC cells and suppressed tumor growth and paclitaxel resistance in vivo. NSD1 knockdown reduced NF-kB activity, while FBXL11 inhibition markedly increased NF-kB activity.

Microarray and real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were used to detect gene expression in HNSCC tissues and cell lines. Transwell migration, invasion, wound healing and cell counting kit - 8 (CCK-8) cell assays were used to compare cell migration, invasion and proliferation abilities. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to detect SP1 binding to the miR-92b promoter. Western blot was used to detect protein levels. An in vivo tumorigenesis experiment was used to evaluate the effect of SP1 knockdown on tumor growth and protein levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. We found that the miR-92b expression level was elevated in HNSCC primary focus tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue, and a higher level of miR-92b was related to a higher clinical stage and worse prognosis of HNSCC patients. MiR-92b and SP1 mutually promoted each expression and cooperatively facilitated the migration, invasion and proliferation of HNSCC cells. A decreased level of SP1\/miR-92b resulted in a restraint of in vivo tumor growth. In conclusion, our results suggest that the SP1\/miR-92b feedback loop generally promotes HNSCC invasion and metastasis, thus presenting a possible therapeutic target in the treatment of HNSCC patients.","853":null,"854":"Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that participates in the progression of numerous diseases.

Inhibition of circ-PSEN1 in ARPE19 cells ameliorated the ferroptosis induced by HG was ameliorated, as evidenced by changes in the ferroptosis-related biomarkers\/genes and decreased cell death. Subsequently, circ-PSEN1 acted as a sponge for miR-200b-3p. Inhibition of miR-200b-3p partially reversed the effects of circ-PSEN1 on ferroptosis. Furthermore, cofilin-2 (CFL2) was the target gene of miR-200b-3p, and it abrogated the inhibitory effect of miR-200b-3p on ferroptosis.

The study aimed to explore the roles and interaction of DEAD-box helicase 21 (DDX21) and cell division cycle 5-like (CDC5L) in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Levels of DDX21 and CDC5L were detected in colorectal cancer cell lines by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. The role of DDX21 and CDC5L on the cell proliferation, cell cycle and tumor growth were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction of DDX21 and CDC5L was predicted by The STRING publicly available data and verified by immunoprecipitation. The results showed that DDX21 was dramatically upregulated in colorectal cancer cells. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that downregulation of DDX21 suppressed colorectal cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle development, and tumor growth, while overexpression of CDC5L reversed the suppressive effects of DDX21 silencing. Furthermore, DDX21 interacted with CDC5L to exert the tumor-promoting effects in CRC.

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect TTN-AS1 expression in CCA samples and cells. Functional experiments were performed using the Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, transwell, and in vivo tumor growth assays. The relationship between TTN-AS1, miR-513a-5p, and stratifin (SFN) was explored using a dual luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiment, and Pearson correlation analysis. The result showed that TTN-AS1 and SFN are highly expressed in CCA tissues. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter and RIP experiments revealed the correlation between TTN-AS1, miR-513a-5p, and SFN. In addition, silencing TTN-AS1 mitigated CCA cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, miR-513a-5p is sponged by TTN-AS1. The miR-513a-5p inhibitor abolished the effect of TTN-AS1 silencing on the aggressive behaviors of CCA cells. Furthermore, we showed that miR-513a-5p is a regulator of CCA by targeting SFN.

Cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, cell growth was assessed using the bromodeoxyuridine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cell migration was tested using a wound healing assay. We found significant upregulation of miR-23b-3p in OS, which prominently promoted the viability, proliferation, and migration of OS cells. Additionally, VEPH1 was found to be a target of miR-23b-3p and its expression was decreased in OS. Lastly, VEPH1 alleviated the promotion effect of miR-23b-3p on the malignancy phenotypes of OS cells via the PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway.

However, they are often associated with adverse effects and result in conditions such as chronic lung disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Hence, aclear understanding of the mechanisms underlying hyperoxia-induced lung damage is crucial in order to mitigate the side effects of oxygen-based therapy. Here, we have established an in vitro model of hyperoxia-induced lung damage in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) and delineated the molecular basis of oxygen therapy-induced impaired alveolar development. Thus, AECIIs were exposed to a hyperoxic environment and their cell viability, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, mitochondrial integrity and dynamics, and energy metabolism were assessed. The results showed that hyperoxia has no significant effect as an inhibitor of SMAD3 and ERK1\/2 in AECIIs, but leads to significant inhibition of cell viability. Further, hyperoxia was found to promote AECII apoptosis and mitochondrial, whereas chemical inhibition of SMAD3 or ERK1\/2 further exacerbated the detrimental effects of hyperoxia in AECIIs. Overall, these findings presented herein demonstrate the critical role of SMAD\/ERK signaling in the regulation of AECII behavior in varying oxygen environments. Thus, this study offers novel insights for the prevention of neonatal lung dysfunction in premature infants.","863":null,"864":null,"865":null,"866":"Wounds are soft tissue injuries, which are difficult to heal and can easily lead to other skin diseases. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the secreted exosomes play a key role in skin wound healing. This study aims to clarify the effects and mechanisms of exosomes derived from BMSCs in wound healing. Exosomes were extracted from the supernatant of the BMSCs. The expression of the micro-RNA miR-93-3p was determined by qRT-PCR analysis. HaCaT cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to establish a skin lesion model. MTT, flow cytometry, and transwell assays were conducted to determine cellular functions. The binding relationship between miR-93-3p and apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (APAF1) was measured using a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. The results showed that BMSC-derived exosomes or BMSC-exos promoted proliferation and migration and suppressed apoptosis in HaCaT cells damaged by H2O2. However, the depletion of miR-93-3p in BMSC-exos antagonized the effects of BMSC-exos on HaCaT cells. In addition, APAF1 was identified as a target of miR-93-3p. Overexpression of APAF1 induced the dysfunction of HaCaT cells. Collectively, the results indicate that BMSC-derived exosomes promote skin wound healing via the miR-93-3p\/APAF1 axis.

Here, 532 differential expression genes (DEGs) related to sepsis and 433 DEGs related to sepsis-induced ARDS were screened in the GSE32707 dataset. Compared with sepsis samples, sepsis ARDS samples showed a higher infiltration of activated memory CD4 T cells and naive B cells, but a relatively lower infiltration of CD8 T cells. The pink and green modules which are significantly associated with sepsis-induced ARDS were then screened through co-expression network analysis. Differentially up-regulated GYPE and aberrantly down-regulated HSPB1, were subsequently found in the pink module of ARDS. CD81 and RPL22, two differentially low-expressed genes peculiar to ARDS, were identified in the green module. The function of CD81 was verified at the cellular level, and it was found that the up-regulation of CD81 in A549 could alleviate the LPS-induced injury of A549 cells. More importantly, the overexpressed CD81 can also increase the content of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Treg in Jurkat cells, and after the co-culture of overexpressed CD81 Jurkat cells with LPS treatment A549 cells, the LPS-induced lung epithelial cell damage can be improved.

After stimulated by LPS, BEAS-2B cells were treated with various concentrations of Octreotide. CCK-8 assay and LDH kits were to evaluate cell cytotoxicity. ELISA kits were to analyze the levels of inflammatory factors. TUNEL staining was to measure cell apoptosis. Western blot assay was used to assess the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, autophagy-related proteins and AKT\/mTOR signaling-related proteins. Then, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was adopted for treating BEAS-2B cells to determine its effects on inflammation and apoptosis. Afterward, adding AKT agonist (SC79) or mTOR antagonist (rapamycin) to explore the impact of Octreotide on autophagy. Results revealed that Octreotide notably enhanced cell viability and reduced LDH activity. The levels of inflammatory factors were significantly decreased following Octreotide treatment. Additionally, Octreotide attenuated the apoptotic capacity of LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells, led to the up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein level while cut down the protein levels of Bax and cleaved caspase3. Remarkably, the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3II\/I and Beclin1 was elevated after Octreotide administration. Importantly, the suppressive effects of Octreotide on the inflammation and apoptosis of LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells was abrogated by 3-MA. Further experiments suggested that Octreotide downregulated p-AKT and mTOR expression in LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells.

Compared with traditional saline-wet-to-dry dressings, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is more effective for the prevention and treatment of wound infections. However, the mechanism by which NPWT controls infection and accelerates wound healing remains unclear. Accordingly, in this study, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of NPWT were explored using a murine model of P. aeruginosa-infected burn wounds. NPWT significantly reduced P. aeruginosa levels in wounds, enhanced blood flow, and promoted wound healing. Additionally, NPWT markedly alleviated wound inflammation and increased the expression of wound healing-related molecules. Recent evidence points to a role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in wound healing; hence, whole-transcriptome sequencing of wound tissues from NPWT and control groups was performed to evaluate circRNA expression profiles. In total, 12 up-regulated and 25 down-regulated circRNAs were identified between groups. Among these, five significant differentially expressed circRNAs acting as microRNA sponges were identified, and their predicted targets were verified by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

The capacity of osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of HBMSCs was evaluated with ALP and alizarin red staining, respectively. cGMP content was determined by ELISA. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to investigate the effect of Hirudin on the expression of osteoblast-specific markers, including Runx2, osterix (OSX), osteocalcin (OCN), and collagen1 (Col1). In our study, Hirudin treatment promoted cell viability. Moreover, Hirudin treatment increased ALP activity of HBMSCs and red coloration of alizarin. Interestingly, cGMP inhibitor partly reversed the effect of Hirudin on the proliferation, differentiation and mineralization of HBMSCs.

Moreover, the activity of ROS, SOD, CAT and GSH were measured to elucidate oxidative stress level. Ferroptosis was examined by levels of Fe2+, GPX4 and ASCL4. Expressions of PI3K\/AKT signaling were identified by western blot assay. The results revealed that LAP inhibited the cell viability and exacerbated cell injury induced by Dox, as well as increased cell apoptosis. LAP aggravated DOX-induced mitochondria damage by changed mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased ATP and increased level of Cytochrome C. In addition, the combination of LAP and DOX induced oxidative stress and ferroptosis in H9c2 cells. The activation of PI3K\/AKT signaling reversed the detrimental effects of LAP on DOX-induced H9c2 cells. The data in this study showed for the first time that LAP aggravated Dox-induced cardiotoxicity by promoting oxidative stress and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes via PI3K\/AKT-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that PI3K\/AKT activation is a promising cardioprotective strategy for DOX \/LAX combination therapies.","884":null,"885":null,"886":"For humans, gastric cancer (GC) is a common malignancy. Multiple circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been confirmed to be important cancer-promoting or tumor-suppressive factors. The present study discusses the roles and mechanisms of circ_0000423 in GC development. In this study, circ_0000423 expression in GC patient tissue samples and cell lines was detected via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Disheveled-Axin domain containing 1 (DIXDC1) expression in GC cells was examined via Western blot. Besides, cell counting kit-8 was utilized for detecting GC cell viability. GC cell migration and invasion were examined through Transwell assays. Bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were employed to verify the regulatory relationships between microRNA-582-3p (miR-582-3p) and circ_0000423 or DIXDC1. In the present study, we demonstrated that circ_0000423 was highly expressed in GC. Circ_0000423 knockdown suppressed GC cell viability, migration and invasion. Moreover, miR-582-3p was confirmed as a direct target of circ_0000423, and an upstream regulator of DIXDC1. MiR-582-3p inhibition or DIXDC1 overexpression could reverse the above-mentioned effects of knocking down circ_0000423 on GC cells.

However, data on the exact mechanisms that define the relationship between the TME and THCA remain scant. We calculated stromal and immune cells scores and the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) by CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE based on the THCA gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition, we evaluated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from high- and low-score groups and performed functional enrichment analysis. Furthermore, our data show a significant correlation between plasma complement factor B (CFB) and PTC development and prognosis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that the CFB was mainly enriched in immune response pathways. The expression of CFB was positively correlated with T cells CD8, Macrophages M1, Plasma cells, T cells CD4 memory activated, T cells follicular helper and T cells regulatory (Tregs), whereas negatively correlated with Eosinophils, Macrophages M0, Macrophages M2, Mast cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting in the TME. Finally, the expression level of CFB was verified by other cohorts from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses, which was consistent with the results of bioinformatic analysis. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the CFB could be a prognostic marker for THCA and its expression influences the infiltration of immune cells.","888":null,"889":"Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is the most frequent type of malignant brain tumor with a poor prognosis. After optimal surgery, radiotherapy plus temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard treatment for GBM patients. However, the development of TMZ resistance limits its efficacy in GBM management. Runt Related Transcription Factor 1 (RUNX1) and microRNAs have been implicated in drug resistance of TMZ in GBM. In this study, we revealed the underlying mechanism of TMZ resistance and identified miR-128-3p\/RUNX1 axis as a novel target for TMZ resistance in GBM. RUNX1 expression was significantly upregulated in GBM tissues as compared to normal tissues, and its expression was even higher in recurrent GBM tissues and TMZ-resistant GBM cells. RUNX1 depletion inhibited the viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and TMZ resistance of GBM cells, which could be rescued by RUNX1 overexpression. We further identified miR-128-3p as a tumor-suppressor whose overexpression restored the sensitivity of TMZ in GBM cells. miR-128-3p negatively regulated RUNX1 and subsequently downregulated multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). Together, the present study indicates that RUNX1 confers TMZ resistance in GBM by upregulating MRP1, which is negatively regulated by miR-128-3p. Targeting miR-128-3p\/RUNX1\/MRP1 axis provides a potential strategy to overcome TMZ resistance in GBM.","890":"Breast cancer (BC), an extremely aggressive malignant tumor, causes a large number of deaths worldwide. In this study, we pooled profile datasets from three cohorts to illuminate the underlying key genes and pathways of BC. Expression profiles GSE42568, GSE45827, and GSE124646, including 244 BC tissues and 28 normal breast tissues, were integrated and analyzed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out based on these three datasets. Functional analysis including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway were performed using The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Moreover, Cytoscape with Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plugin were utilized to visualize protein protein interaction (PPI) of these DEGs. The module with the highest connectivity of gene interactions was selected for further analysis. All of these hub genes had a significantly worse prognosis in BC by survival analysis. Additionally, four genes (CDK1, CDC20, AURKA, and MCM4) dramatically were enriched in oocyte meiosis and cell cycle pathways through re-analysis of DAVID. Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of CDK1, CDC20, AURKA, and MCM4 were significantly increased in BC patients. In addition, knockdown of CDK1 and CDC20 by small interfering RNA remarkably suppressed cell migration and invasion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

HCC clinical samples were collected, and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), and transwell migration and invasion assays were performed. Furthermore, interaction was detected via double luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. MEG3, miR-5195-3p, and FOXO1 expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. Xenograft tumor models were established to investigate the effect of MEG3 in vivo. Compared with normal tissues, MEG3 expression was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues. MEG3 overexpression inhibited the viability and migration of HCC cells. Double luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays confirmed the binding between MEG3 and miR-5195-3p as well as between miR-5195-3p and FOXO1. RT-qPCR and Western blotting results showed that MEG3 inhibited the expression of miR-5195-3p and promoted that of FOXO1. Additionally, MEG3 overexpression inhibited HCC tumorigenesis and progression in xenograft tumor models while depletion of MEG3 exerted the opposite way.

A cost-effective and rapid platform for the endogenous antibodies expression via using the in vitro transcription (IVT) technique to produce nucleoside-modified mRNA and then encapsulated into lipid nanoparticle (LNP) may turn the body to a manufactory. Coinhibitory pathway of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 receptor (PD-1) could suppress the T-cell mediated immunity. We hypothesized that the coblocking of PD-L1 and PD-1 via bispecific antibodies may achieve more potential antitumor efficacies compare with the monospecific ones. Here, we described the application of mRNA to encode a bispecific antibody with ablated Fc immune effector functions that targets both human PD-L1 and PD-1, termed XA-1, which was further assessed the in vitro functional activities and in vivo antitumor efficacies. The in vitro mRNA-encoded XA-1 held comparable abilities to fully block the PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway as well as to enhance functional T cell activation compared to XA-1 protein from CHO cell source. Pharmacokinetic tests showed enhanced area under curve (AUC) of mRNA-encoded XA-1 compared with XA-1 at same dose. Chronic treatment of LNP-encapsulated XA-1 mRNA in the mouse tumor models which were reconstituted with human immune cells effectively induced promising antitumor efficacies compared to XA-1 protein.

We aimed to examine the relationship between miR-1255b-p expression and prostate cancer and elucidate the function of miR-1255b-5p in prostate cancer. miR-1255b-5p were measured using Quantitative Real-Time PCR from the blood 103 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and 153 prostate cancer patients (117 indolent cases and 36 upgrading cases). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the discriminating ability of miR-1255b-5p was accessed between BPH and prostate cancer participants, or indolent and aggressive type. Using CCK-8 and Transwell assays, the function of miR-1255b-5p on prostate cancer cells was investigated. The levels of miR-1255b-5p were significantly raised in prostate cancer patients when compared with BPH participants. MiR-1255b-5p level can distinguish prostate cancer patients from BPH or indolent type from aggressive type. Downregulation of miR-1255b-5p can suppress the proliferative, invasive, and migratory capacity, but this effect can be eradicated by EPB41L1 inhibition.

Dysregulated nesfatin-1 has been observed in women with GDM, but the specific role of nesfatin-1 underlying the pathological process of GDM is unclear. The main objective of this study is to investigate the role and the molecular mechanism of nesfatin-1 in GDM. HTR-8\/SVneo cells were treated with high glucose (HG)\/high lipid (HL) to mimic the injured trophoblast of GDM in vitro. Cell viability, cytotoxicity and apoptosis were measured using CCK-8, LDH and TUNEL assays, respectively. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant factors were detected using their commercial kits. ATP level and cytochrome c were determined with corresponding detecting kits. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were performed to detect the expression of corresponding genes. The results showed that nesfatin-1 was downregulated upon HG\/HL stimulation. Nesfatin-1 treatment greatly alleviated HG\/HL-induced cell viability loss, cytotoxicity, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in HTR-8\/SVneo cells. In addition, nesfatin-1 promoted ATP generation, reduced the leakage of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, and upregulated mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, nesfatin-1 inhibited p38 MAPK signaling. p79350, an agonist of p38 MAPK signaling, remarkably hindered the protective role of nesfatin-1 in HG\/HL-induced HTR-8\/SVneo cells.

M2 macrophages possess certain anti-inflammation activity. Accordingly, the current study set out to investigate the potential mechanism of M2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (M2-EVs) in UC inflammation. Firstly, mouse peritoneal macrophages were induced to M2 phenotype, and M2-EVs were isolated. , the murine model of UC was established, and the length and weight of the colon, disease activity index (DAI), apoptosis, and inflammatory response of UC mice were measured. Young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells were induced with the help of lipopolysaccharide. LncRNA maternally expressed 3 (LncRNA MEG3), miR-20b-5p, and cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) expression patterns were detected in UC models. In addition, we analyzed the binding relationship among MEG3, miR-20b-5p, and CREB1. UC mice presented with shortened colon length, lightened weight, increased DAI score, enhanced apoptosis, and significant inflammatory cell infiltration, while M2-EVs reversed these trends. In vitro, M2-EVs increased UC cell viability and reduced inflammation. Mechanistic experimentation revealed that M2-EVs transferred MEG3 into YAMC cells to up-regulate MEG3 expression and promote CREB1 transcription by competitively binding to miR-20b-5p. Moreover, up-regulation of MEG3 in M2-EVs enhanced the protective effect of M2-EVs on UC cells, while over-expression of miR-20b-5p attenuated the aforementioned protective effect of M2-EVs on UC mice and cells.

Along with the improvement of treatment strategies, the cure rate of RB has increased significantly. However, the treatment of advanced and recurrent RB remains as a critical challenge. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of RB is essential for the development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies. Through the analysis of a previously published microarray study, we found that ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) was highly expressed in RB tissues as compared to normal tissues. The purpose of this study is to clarify the role and mechanism of RRM2 in regulating the progression of RB. We first demonstrated that RRM2 expression level in RB tissues and cell lines was significantly higher when compared to that in normal retinal tissue and cell lines, and high RRM2 expression level was associated with a poorer overall survival of patients. In RB cells, RRM2 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), while RRM2 silencing suppressed these biological features. Silencing RRM2 reduced the activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)\/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway, and the presence of JAK2\/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibitor INCB attenuated the effect of RRM2 overexpression.

We collected NB tumor samples and adjacent normal tissues to compare lncRNA NHEG1 expression. Through bioinformatic target prediction, we selected potential downstream effectors of lncRNA NHEG1 for functional validation in NB cell lines. We observed that lncRNA NHEG1 was significantly upregulated in NB tissues as compared to the normal tissues. In NB tissues, lncRNA NHEG1 expression showed an inverse correlation with hsa-miR-665 (miR-655), but a positive correlation with high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). In NB cell lines, lncRNA NHEG1 knockdown caused the upregulation of miR-665 and the downregulation of HMGB1.

LncRNA CASC7 has also been revealed to participate in the development of several cancers as a tumor promoter or suppressor. Herein, we focus on uncovering the role and underlying molecular mechanism of CASC7 in breast cancer. Tumor tissues and the paired paracancerous tissues from the breast cancer patients were used to evaluate the level of CASC7 in breast cancer. By analyzing the CASC7 expression in breast cancer cell lines, both the expression levels of CASC7 in cancer tissues and cell lines were obviously downregulated compared to those in paired paracancerous tissues and normal human epithelial MCF10A cells.

On the other hand, mutations that led to AKT3 loss-of-function were correlated to a better prognosis in patients. Moreover, AKT3 silencing significantly inhibited the proliferation, DNA synthesis and colony formation of NCCIT cells (a TGCT cell line). AKT3 might participate in TGCT progression through multiple signaling pathways, such as ErbB, oxidative phosphorylation, and affecting tumor immune infiltration.

This study investigates whether miR-506 can prevent NSCLC progression by mediating TULP3. In vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to explore the function and potential regulatory relationship of miR-506 and TULP3 in NSCLC. Our results revealed that miR-506 is high expression in NSCLC cell lines, and the overexpression of miR-506 could inhibit cell viability and enhance cell apoptosis in H1299 and A549 cells. Pro-apoptotic related protein (cytochrome C, Bax, and cleaved caspase-9) expression increased while anti-apoptotic related protein (BCL-2 and BCL-XL) expression decreased after miR-506 was overexpression. Meanwhile, the overexpression of miR-506 could notably downregulate TULP3. Additionally, silence of TULP3 inhibited cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis. At the same time, pro-apoptotic related protein expression was promoted while anti-apoptotic related protein expression was inhibited. Furthermore, TULP3 overexpression could markedly reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-506 on the proliferation and induction of mitochondrial apoptosis in H1299 and A549 cells. In vivo tumor formation experiments also exhibited consistent results indicating that the functions of TULP3 might be correlated with the promotion of tumorigenesis.

Numerous studies have proposed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gout. We aimed to reveal the function of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 8 (SNHG8) in acute gouty arthritis (GA). A GA mouse model was established by injection of MSU into footpads. The levels of SNHG8, miR-542-3p and adaptor-related protein complex 3 subunit delta 1 (AP3D1) in footpads were detected via polymerase chain reaction analysis. Hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed the paw swelling in mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot analysis were applied to determine the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. SNHG8 expression was identified to be upregulated after MSU treatment. Ablation of SNHG8 decreased the MSU-induced enhancement of paw swelling and foot thickness. In addition, SNHG8 depletion decreased the protein levels of proinflammatory factors in GA mice. Mechanically, SNHG8 was verified to be a sponge of miR-542-3p, and miR-542-3p targeted AP3D1 3' untranslated region. SNHG8 competitively bound with miR-542-3p to upregulate AP3D1 expression. Finally, results of rescue assays illustrated that AP3D1 upregulation offset the SNHG8-mediated inhibition on paw swelling and protein levels of proinflammatory factors in GA mice.

To explore the prognostic value of HPV 16\/18 genotyping and geminin mRNA quantification in predicting the progressiveness of LSIL. We recruited 212 participants who were negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM 76), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL 85), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL 36) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade cervical cancer grade 3, (CIN3 15) patients. Tissues were obtained during excisional treatment. HPV 16\/18 genotyping and geminin mRNA qRT-PCR were performed. HPV 16\/18 positivity rate and geminin mRNA level were integrated with the clinical parameters into a multivariate logistic model. Area under curve was yielded based on receiver operation curve derived from this multivariate logistic model. Follow-up visits were performed to LSIL patients with progression. HSIL patients have higher HPV 16\/18 positivity rate and geminin mRNA levels than LSIL. Among HSIL, CIN3 have higher HPV 16\/18 positivity rate and geminin mRNA levels. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that HPV 16\/18 positivity and geminin mRNA expression status are independent factors for differentiating HSIL and LSIL. The baseline HPV 16\/18 positivity rate and geminin mRNA levels of 18 LSIL patients who developed HSIL are significantly higher than non-progressive LSIL patients. The values examined at follow-up timepoints were also higher than baseline. These results suggest that geminin is implicated in the progression of LSIL and combining HPV 16\/18 genotyping and geminin mRNA qRT-PCR could potentially differentiating the progressive LSIL and improve the efficacy of clinical intervention.","923":"Abnormal mechanical stimulation contributes to articular cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis (OA) development. Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in mechanical force-induced cartilage degeneration. LncRNA HOTAIR (HOTAIR) has been demonstrated to increase osteoarthritis progression. However, the roles of HOTAIR in mechanical stimulation-treated chondrocytes are still unclear. In this study, we found that mechanical stimulation significantly induced apoptosis in C28\/I2 cells. In addition, the expression of HOTAIR was up regulated and the expression of miR-221 was down regulated. Knockdown of HOTAIR effectively ameliorated cell apoptosis induced by mechanical stimulation. HOTAIR could interact with miR-221, which targeted to degrade BBC3. Overexpression of BBC3 could reverse the decreased apoptotic rates induced by HOTAIR knockdown. Collectively, HOTAIR promoted mechanical stimulation-induced apoptosis by regulating the miR-221\/BBC3 axis in C28\/I2 cells.","924":"A great many microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play different roles in human cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). However, the specific character of miR-23a-3p in GC has not been elucidated. This study was to explore the function of miR-23a-3p in GC. The results manifested that miR-23a-3p was down-regulated in GC and patients with reduced miR-23a-3p had poor prognosis. Functional experiments assured that elevated miR-23a-3p refrained GC proliferation, invasion, migration, PIK3\/Akt phosphorylation and apoptosis, while knockdown miR-23a-3p accelerated the growth of GC. Double luciferase report experiments manifested that miR-23a-3p targeted CCL22 expression. Functional rescue experiments affirmed that the repression of elevated miR-23a-3p on GC was reversed by simultaneous augmented CCL22. In vivo, elevated miR-23a-3p restrained the volume and tumor of GC and reduced the expression of CCL22 and phosphorylated PIK3\/Akt, while knockdown miR-23a-3p motivated tumor growth. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that miR-23a-3p plays a repressive role in GC, and affects the progression of GC via down-regulating CCL22 and blocking PI3K\/AKT signal transduction pathway, which may offer a new molecular target for clinical treatment of GC.","925":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the severe microvascular complications of diabetes. The protective effects of FA on retinal vascular endothelial cells against high glucose levels involve in multiple aspects in DR; however, the underlying mechanism is not fully elucidated. In present study, we investigated the transcriptome as well as genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signature in human retinal microvascular endothelial ACBRI 181 cells cultured within high glucose (HG) medium supplemented with or without FA by RNA-seq, MeDIP-seq, and hMeDIP-seq. Total 3308 differential expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in multiple biological processes and molecular functions containing angiogenesis, inflammation, S-adenosyl methionine metabolism, and hypoxia response. Moreover, the global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in ACBRI 181 cells with FA treatment were both compromised compared to HG. Combined with transcriptome data, four subclusters of DEGs with hyper- or hypomethylated promoters were further verified. Unexpectedly, promoters of these 487 genes all displayed a pattern of increased DNA hydroxymethylation. Furthermore, hyperglycemia rat model was established and administered with FA. The DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation changes of selected target genes COL1A1, ITGA7, MMP-14, and VEGFB confirmed by MeDIP-qPCR were consistent with the results in human ACBRI 181 cells. Finally, the presence of activated DNMT1 and TET2 induced by FA was determined in ACBRI 181 cells and hyperglycemia rat. Taken together, this research provided a resource of expression and epigenetic profiles in retinal microvascular endothelial cell, emphasizing a pharmacological mechanism of FA on DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation regulation in retinal microvessel cells of DR.","926":"In recent years, a steady increase has been detected in the incidence of acute cerebral infarction (ACI). ACI is caused by blood flow disruption, leading to high disability and mortality rates. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is critical toward developing effective therapeutic approaches. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an important class of non-coding RNAs, which have been implicated in several molecular pathways, and their dysregulation has been described in several disease conditions. Here, we set out to explore the possible regulatory role of circRNAs in ischemic stroke and study their molecular function in disease. First, we applied high-throughput sequencing techniques to identify the differential changes of plasma circRNAs expression in patients with acute cerebral infarction. Next, we used GO and KEGG pathway analysis to predict the function of differentially expressed circRNAs. Moreover, we have assessed the possible interaction between the identified differentially expressed circRNAs and miRNAs.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical value and potential role of lncRNA interferon (IFN) gamma antisense RNA 1 (IFNG-AS1) in colon adenocarcinoma. This study enrolled 95 colorectal adenoma patients, 128 colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, and 88 healthy individuals. The serum, tissue IFNG-AS1 expression levels were explored by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. The receiver operator characteristic curve and Kaplan-Meier method were used to assess the clinical significance of IFNG-AS1. The chi-square test was used to analyze the association between tissue IFNG-AS1 and clinical characteristics. Functional experiments were conducted to delve into the effects of IFNG-AS1 on cellular activities (cell viability\/migration\/invasion). The target miRNA of IFNG-AS1 was also explored. IFNG-AS1 expression in both serum and tissue samples was elevated in patients. Serum IFNG-AS1 could diagnose colon adenoma and adenocarcinoma patients from the healthy control. High tissue IFNG-AS1 was correlated with several clinical characteristics and a shorter overall survival time. Silence of IFNG-AS1 could be available for repressing cellular capacities via the sponge to miR-627-3p. IFNG-AS1 was rised in colon adenocarcinoma and it was relevant to tumor size, TNM stage, and poor prognosis of patients.

IFNG-AS1 might be a potential diagnosis or prognosis predictor for colon adenocarcinoma patients.","931":"This investigation aimed to assess the levels of serum OIP5-AS1 and micro RNA-410-3p (miR-410-3p) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and their potential molecular mechanism. The levels of OIP5-AS1 and miR-410-3p as well as mRNA levels of IL-13 were measured. Pearson variable linear test was applied to analyze the correlations between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and OIP5-AS1. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to predict the predictive possibility of OIP5-AS1. The viable cells were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry was used to detect the cell apoptosis. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to indicate the inflammatory situation of 16HBE cells. Luciferase activity assay was conducted to examine the relationships between OIP5-AS1 and miR-410-3p together with miR-410-3p and IL-13. Augmented levels of OIP5-AS1, declined levels of miR-410-3p, and enhanced expression of IL-13 were unveiled. The expression of OIP5-AS1 and miR-410-3p was related to the ratio of FEV1 respectively. OIP5-AS1 might serve as a diagnostic biomarker. Interference of OIP5-AS1 restored the abnormal cell viability, apoptosis, and inflammation in cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-stimulated 16HBE cells by regulating miR-410-3p and IL-13. OIP5-AS1 appeared to be a biomarker for distinguishing COPD patients from smokers.

However, its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been validated to exert vital roles in IDD. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that OIP5-AS1, a potential regulator of IDD, modulates IDD progression. RT-PCR was utilized to detect levels of OIP5-AS1, miR-25-3p, Collagen II and Aggrecan in IDD tissues and nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). Immunofluorescence assay measured Collagen II expression. CCK-8, EdU, and flow cytometry estimated the levels of proliferation and apoptosis. Proteins were assessed via Western blot. The binding affinity of OIP5-AS1 with miR-25-3p was investigated by luciferase reporter assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyzed the levels of inflammatory factors. OIP5-AS1 was high expressed in IDD tissues and its expression gradually promoted with the increasing of Pfirrmann scores. The cell morphology of NPCs changed into spindle-shaped, and Collagen II expression was low. After OIP5-AS1 was silenced, cell proliferation was boosted whereas both apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation were restrained. In LPS-activated NPCs, OIP5-AS1 depletion also suppressed inflammation response. Further, miR-25-3p was a target of OIP5-AS1. The effects of OIP5-AS1 silence on proliferation, apoptosis, and ECM degradation were reversed upon miR-25-3p downregulation. Moreover, the inhibitory impact of OIP5-AS1 knockdown on the inflammation of LPS-treated NPCs was rescued with miR-25-3p inference. In general, lncRNA OIP5-AS1 exerted its effects in IDD by targeting miR-25-3p, implying the usage of OIP5-AS1\/miR-25-3p as a novel regulatory axis for the molecular targets of IDD therapy.","933":null,"934":null,"935":null,"936":"As the most common and aggressive malignant form of skin cancer, melanoma has a poor prognosis in its late stage.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and mechanism of miR-520d-3p in melanoma. The expression of anti-silencing function 1B histone chaperone (ASF1B) and miR-520d-3p in melanoma tissues and cells was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The interaction between ASF1B and miR-520d-3p was verified by luciferase activity detection. Cell counting kit-8, bromodeoxyuridine, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and cell adhesion assays were performed to detect cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and adhesion in melanoma cells. ASF1B expression was evidently increased, whereas miR-520d-3p level was downregulated in melanoma tissues and cells. Overexpression of ASF1B enhanced cell growth and adhesion and hampered cell apoptosis in melanoma cells. Furthermore, miR-520d-3p suppressed the tumorigenic effects of melanoma cells. Moreover, miR-520d-3p suppressed the expression of ASF1B to suppress melanoma tumorigenesis. In conclusion, we have found out that miR-520d-3p suppressed melanoma tumorigenesis by inhibiting ASF1B, which could be a promising target for melanoma therapy.","937":"Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancy with a leading mortality rate worldwide. Despite the progress in the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy, the associated mortality is still growing. It is of great significance to understand molecular mechanisms of the development of gastric cancer. Glycolysis is a main source of ATP provision for cancer cells including gastric cancer, and targeting glycolysis is a promising therapeutic strategy. Centromere protein U (CENPU) has been found to be overexpressed in many types of cancer. Downregulation of CENPU suppresses the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. High mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) is identified as a biomarker to diagnose of gastric cancer. Knockdown of HMGB2 inhibits proliferation and glycolysis in gastric cancer cells. In this work, we identified that CENPU was upregulated in gastric cancer. Knockdown of CENPU was able to suppress the proliferation and glycolysis of gastric cancer cells. Further the results showed that the anti-cancer effect of CENPU was HMGB2-dependent. Taken together, CENPU is an upstream factor of HMGB2, which regulates proliferation and glycolysis of gastric cancer.","938":"As the second most common cancer among women, cervical cancer is a huge threat to their health all over the world. Integral membrane protein 2A (ITM2A), a member of the Type II Integral Membrane protein (ITM2) family, has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Moreover, the low expression of ITM2A was associated with cervical adenocarcinoma. However, the function of ITM2A in drug resistance in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here, we used bioinformatics methods to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) closely related to chemotherapeutic relapse cervical carcinoma. ITM2A is downregulated in cervical tumor tissues and is associated with poor survival. Furthermore, ITM2A is also downregulated in cervical cancer cells with cisplatin resistance. Overexpression of ITM2A increases the cisplatin sensitivity of cervical cancer cells. Mechanically, ITM2A upregulation mediates the sensitivity of cervical cancer cell through Notch signaling pathway. Our study suggests that ITM2A may serve as a target in mediating cisplatin-resistant cervical cancer.","939":"Atherosclerosis (AS) is a typical vascular disease.

Sepsis is a major cause of injuries in heart, which are related to high mortality rates. This study was therefore carried out to analyze the potential crosstalk between CRNDE and TUG1 in sepsis, with a focus on sepsis-induced cell apoptosis in heart. Expression of CRNDE and TUG1 was analyzed with RT-qPCR. Correlations between them were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient. CRNDE and TUG1 were overexpressed in cardiomyocytes to determine the relationship between them. The roles of CRNDE and TUG1 in regulating the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes were explored by cell apoptosis assay. We found that both CRNDE and TUG1 were downregulated in sepsis. In cardiomyocytes, LPS treatment resulted in the downregulation of CRNDE and TUG1. Overexpression of CRNDE and TUG1 in cardiomyocytes increased the expression levels of each other. Under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, decreased apoptosis rates of cardiomyocytes were observed after CRNDE and TUG1 overexpression. CRNDE and TUG1 co-overexpression showed a stronger effect.

Seventy-nine neonatal pneumonia (NP) patients and 80 NS patients were enrolled in this study. Reverse Transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression levels of CASC15 and miR-144-3p. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the diagnostic value of CASC15 in NS. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS to simulate the inflammatory response in NS patients, and the regulation and mechanism of CASC15 on the inflammatory response were explored in this in vitro cell model. Serum CASC15 was upregulated in NS patients, and it had the ability to distinguish NS patients from NP patients. LPS stimulation increased the expression of CASC15 and simultaneously stimulated the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, while the knockdown of CASC15 alleviated the inflammatory response induced by LPS stimulation. Besides, serum miR-144-3p was reduced in NS patients, and luciferase reporter genes showed that miR-144-3p was a direct target of CASC15. Overexpression of CASC15 may promote the inflammatory response of NS by targeted regulating the expression of miR-144-3p, which may provide us with new insights in the treatment of NS.","942":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) or exosomes have been reported to exert key regulatory and\/or communication functions in human cancer. Nevertheless, current literature on the effects of exosomal circRNAs on tumor invasion and metastasis in thyroid cancer is incomplete.

Gene expression analysis in PTC cell lines and exosomes was performed with quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Transwell, wound healing, Western blot assays, and the cell counting kit-8 were applied for functional analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to examine the interaction between hsa_circ_007293 (circ007293), microRNA (miR)-653-5p, and paired box 6 (PAX6). Results showed that circ007293 was enriched in exosomes derived from PTC patient serum and cell culture media. Moreover, circ007293 could enter PTC cells through exosomes, and exosomal circ007293 promoted PTC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, and proliferation. circ007293 knockdown reversed the malignant phenotype of PTC cells in vitro. Additionally, circ007293 could competitively bind with miR-653-5p to regulate PAX6 expression. Notably, miR-653-5p overexpression or PAX6 inhibition suppressed the malignant effects of exosomal circ007293.

Here, our work shows that lncRNA DLGAP1 antisense RNA 1 (DLGAP1-AS1) is up-regulated in ADR-resistant BC cells (MCF-7\/ADR). Clinically, higher DLGAP1-AS1 expression was closely correlated to poorer clinical prognosis. Results showed that DLGAP1-AS1 promoted the ADR IC50 and proliferation of ADR-resistant cells. Moreover, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase WT1 associated protein (WTAP) binds to the m6A modified site of DLGAP1-AS1 and motivates its stability. Mechanistically, DLGAP1-AS1 sponged miR-299-3p through 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) binding, which in turn relieved the repression of WTAP and thus upregulated WTAP expression.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in glaucoma. RGCs were stimulated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) to mimic the in vitro model of glaucoma. A mouse model of glaucoma induced by chronic elevated intraocular pressure was also established. The apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy of RGCs were detected by flow cytometry analysis, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining, and Western blotting, respectively. Retinal pathological changes were exhibited by hemotoxylin and eosin staining. Baicalin restrained the NMDA-induced cell apoptosis, autophagy, and oxidative stress of RGCs by activating the PI3K\/AKT signaling in vitro. The elevated intraocular pressure-induced pathological changes in retinas of glaucoma mice were attenuated by baicalin. Moreover, the number of RGCs was significantly decreased in glaucoma mice, and then increased by baicalin treatment. Baicalin also inhibited autophagy and activated PI3K\/AKT signaling in vivo.

The interplay between miR-1343-3p and ASMTL-AS1 or LAMC1 was verified through luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. ASMTL-AS1 and LAMC1 were highly expressed in HCC tissues and cells, whereas miR-1343-3p showed low expression. Clinically, miR-1343-3p expression in HCC tissues showed a negative correlation with ASMTL-AS1 or LAMC1 expression. Functional assays demonstrated that ASMTL-AS1 silencing suppressed HCC cell proliferation and migration and increased cell apoptosis. More interestingly, ASMTL-AS1 sponged miR-1343-3p and miR-1343-3p to target the 3'-UTR of LAMC1, thereby interfering with the malignant behavior of HCC cells.

Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 2 (ZEB2) promoted neuron astrogliosis, which play a protected role in neuron regeneration. However, its precise mechanism remains unclear. This study investigated the mechanism of ZEB2 on astrogliosis and neuron regeneration after cerebral ischemia reperfusion condition. To confirm our hypothesis, Neurons and astrocytes were isolated from fetal Sprague Dawley rats, in vivo Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion\/reperfusion (MCAO\/R) rat model and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation\/reperfusion (OGD\/R)-treated astrocytes and neurocytes model were constructed. Our results showed that ZEB2 was expressed in nucleus of astrocyte and upregulated after OGD\/R induction, ZEB2 promoted astrogliosis. Further upregulation of ZEB2 promoted the astrogliosis, which promoted neuron proliferation and regeneration by decreased pyroptosis. Moreover, this finding was further confirmed in vivo MCAO\/R rat model. Overexpression of ZEB2 promoted astrogliosis, which decreased infarct volume and accumulated recovery of neurological function by alleviated pyroptosis. This finding revealed that ZEB2 was a regulator of the astrogliosis after ischemia\/reperfusion injury, and then astrogliosis promoted neuron regeneration via decreased neuron pyroptosis.

In conclusion, our study confirmed hsa_circ_0005797 is a poor prognostic factor for EC and modulates EC phenotypes by regulating the hsa_circ_000579\/miR-298\/CTNND1 signaling, which provides potential treatment targets for EC.","961":"The importance of angiogenesis in multiple myeloma (MM) is unquestionable; however, to date, the success of antiangiogenic therapies has been fairly limited. Exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been proven to be pivotal players in angiogenesis in various cancers. Nevertheless, their role in MM remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in peripheral blood exosomes from MM patients and explore their diagnostic and prognostic values. We screened 2,052 circRNAs with significant differential expression between MM patients and healthy controls via high-throughput sequencing. qRT-PCR confirmed that the expression of circ-ATP10A was significantly increased in MM patients. The bioinformatics analyses suggested that circ-ATP10A can act as a microRNA (miRNA) sponge and regulate the expression of downstream vascular endothelial growth factor-B (VEGFB), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1A), platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (PDGFA), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). The immunohistochemical results indicated that the circ-ATP10A level was positively correlated with the protein levels of VEGFB and marrow microvessel density (MVD) in MM patients, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses confirmed it as a prognostic biomarker. Collectively, our study indicates that exosomal circ-ATP10A is a valuable prognostic biomarker in MM and may promote MM angiogenesis by targeting hsa-miR-6758-3p\/hsa-miR-3977\/hsa-miR-6804-3p\/hsa-miR-1266-3p\/hsa-miR-3620-3p and modulating their downstream mRNAs, such as VEGFB, HIF1A, PDGF, and FGF.","962":"The incidence and mortality of breast cancer rank first among all types of female tumors. To improve patients' prognosis with advanced breast cancer, new and more effective targets still need to be explored and identified. Tetraspanin 1 (TSPAN1) is highly expressed in several cancers and affects the progression of these tumors. However, there are few studies focused on its role in breast cancer. Previous study showed that TSPAN1 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, and whether TSPAN1 could promote breast cancer via regulating EMT needs further study. In this study, we found high TSPAN1 expression in breast cancer tumor samples and cell lines which was confirmed by bioinformation analysis. The ablation of TSPAN1 suppressed the growth, and motility of breast cancer cells. We further found that TSPAN1 affected the EMT and mediated the PI3K\/Akt pathway in breast cancer cells. In addition, TSPAN1 depletion suppressed tumor growth of breast cancer in mice. In summary, we thought TSPAN1 suppressed growth and motility of breast cancer via mediating EMT and PI3K\/AKT pathway, and could serve as a potential target for treatment of breast cancer.","963":null,"964":"This study aims to investigate the potential clinical function of long non-coding RNA CERS6-AS1 (lncRNA CERS6-AS1) integrated miR-567 in gastric cancer. The expression of CERS6-AS1 in gastric cancer tissues was detected through RT-qPCR in contrast to the normal tissues. The correlation between the expression of lncRNA CERS6-AS1 and the characteristics of clinical data was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curve was used to assess the survival analysis, while Cox proportional hazards model multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic risk factors of gastric cancer to verify the prognostic possibility of CERS6-AS1. The expression of CERS6-AS1 in different gastric cancer cells was detected, being the development of gastric cancer cells after knockdown CERS6-AS1 studied using CCK-8, Transwell migration, and invasion detection methods. The targeting effect and interaction between CERS6-AS1 and miR-567 through biological analysis and luciferase activity detection. The expression of lncRNA CERS6-AS1 was elevated in gastric cancer tissues and cells. The results of this study demonstrate that the condition of gastric cancer patients was related to the expression of CERS6-AS1, and therefore CERS6-AS1 might be a prognostic factor for the progression of gastric cancer. In addition, the ability of gastric cancer cells to proliferate, migrate and invade could be reduced by knockdown CERS6-AS1. After CERS6-AS1 knockdown, the expression level of miR-567 in gastric cancer tissues decreased, while the expression level of miR-567 increased. In conclusion, lncRNA CERS6-AS1 might promote the progression of gastric cancer and had the potential as a prognostic marker of gastric cancer.","965":null,"966":null,"967":null,"968":null,"969":null,"970":null,"971":null,"972":null,"973":null,"974":"Spindle and kinetochore associated (SKA) complex subunit, which maintains the stability of mitotic metaphase, with emerging research implying its effect as a carcinogenic regulator in cancer. However, its potential role in BC has not been fully elucidated. ONCOMINE, UALCAN, GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal and TIMER databases were performed to analyze the expression, prognosis, mutation, immune infiltration and potential biological mechanisms of SKA1\/2\/3 in BC. Our results showed that SKA1\/2\/3 expression was upregulated in BC. Survival analysis reveals that SKA3 overexpression was associated with poor overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), post-progression survival (PPS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). SKA1 overexpression was associated with poor OS, RFS and DMFS while SKA2 overexpression was only associated with RFS and DMFS. Notably, the results implied that SKA1 has a good prognostic value in HER2-positive BC. Besides, the genetic alterations of SKA were investigated and the altered group correlated with shorter progress-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). GO and KEGG analysis showed that SKA1\/2\/3 were implicated in regulating cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway and DNA replication. The 10 Hub genes in the protein network were upregulated in BC and related to poorer prognosis. Additionally, SKA1\/2\/3 expression was negatively correlated with infiltration of various immune cells with antitumor effects, whereas positively correlated with the expression of immune checkpoints molecules. Further experiments revealed that SKA1\/2\/3 silencing markedly impeded the proliferation and migration of BC cells. Herein, our study firmly shows that SKA genes may serve as a promising therapeutic target for patients with BC.","975":null,"976":null,"977":"Gastric cancer (GC) is a common cancer with high incidence. Understanding the epidemiology and physiopathology of GC is crucial for formulating novel therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have implicated long non-coding RNA LINC00240, miR-338-5p and methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in the progression of GC. In this study, we investigated the functional role of LINC00240\/miR-338-5p\/METTL3 axis in regulating the aggressiveness of GC cells. We first demonstrated that LINC00240 was upregulated in GC tissues and GC cell lines. High expression of LINC00240 was associated with advanced TNM stage, a higher extent of distant metastasis and lymph nodes metastasis, and the poor overall and disease-free survival of the patients. In GC cell lines, the knockdown of LINC00240 inhibited GC cell proliferation and migration, but induced cell apoptosis. We further identified and validated the functional interaction between LINC00240 and miR-338-5p. miR-338-5p seemed to function as a downstream target negatively regulated by LINC00240, and miR-338-5p could target METTL3 at 3' UTR to downregulate its expression. In GC tissues, the expression of miR-338-5p was negatively correlated with LINC00240, and the expression of miR-338-5p was negatively correlated with METTL3. Importantly, miR-338-5p inhibitor or METTL3 overexpression could rescue the inhibitory effect of LINC00240 knockdown on cell proliferation and migration, and inhibit the apoptosis induction in GC cells. Taken together, our data imply that the upregulation of LINC00240 in GC cells promotes the malignant phenotype by modulating miR-338-5p\/METTL3 axis, which could serve as potential therapeutic targets for GC treatment.","978":null,"979":null,"980":null,"981":null,"982":null,"983":null,"984":"The pathogenesis of ovarian cancer (OC) is complex.

Multiple databases were used to predict the expression of PRSS8, Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) and sodium channel epithelial 1alpha subunit (SCNN1A) in OC patients and to detect the relationship among the three. The expressions of PRSS8, SREBF2, SCNN1A and related factors of the pathway were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. The cell transfection was used to overexpress or inhibit the expression of PRSS8 and SREBF2, so as to explore its mechanism. MTT assay and Colony formation assay were used to detect cell proliferation. The Transwell and Wound Healing assays were utilized to measure cell invasion and migration. We have further confirmed cell-level studies in animals. We found that PRSS8 expression was up-regulated in OC patients and cell lines. Knocking down PRSS8 reduced the proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OC cells, which was realized by SREBF2 transcriptional regulation. Knocking down SREBF2 reduced PRSS8 and then inhibited the expression of SCNN1A, thus affecting the proliferation, migration and EMT of OC cells. These results also applied to animals experiments.

The purpose of this study is to clarify the role of B7-H4 in CRC and the underlying mechanisms in controlling the progression of CRC. Our data showed that B7-H4 expression in CRC tissues and cell lines was significantly upregulated as compared with normal tissues and normal cell lines. High B7-H4 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis of CRC patients. B7-H4 overexpression promoted the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells, which could be suppressed by Wnt signaling inhibitor. In a mouse xenograft model, silencing B7-H4 suppressed tumor growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells.

The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of miR-874-3p in OP. The expression levels of miR-874-3p and leptin (LEP) in the femoral neck trabeculae of 35 patients with or without OP were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The effects of miR-874-3p or LEP on the cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteocalcin (OCN), and osterix (OSX) levels were observed by upregulating miR-874-3p in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Additionally, calcium deposition levels were evaluated using alizarin red staining (ARS). Molecular mechanisms of miR-874-3p and LEP underlying the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs were also evaluated using bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assays, and RNA pull-down assays. The miR-874-3p levels were significantly lower in the femoral neck trabeculae of patients with OP than those of the control group, while the opposite was observed regarding the levels of LEP. Expression levels of miR-874-3p in hBMSCs were upregulated during osteogenic differentiation, while those of LEP were downregulated. Moreover, miR-874-3p upregulation promoted ALP, RUNX2, OCN, and OSX mRNA expression, cell proliferation, and calcium deposition in hBMSCs. LEP was found to be a target gene of miR-874-3p. Overexpression of LEP inhibited the expression of osteoblast markers and reversed the effect of osteogenic differentiation induced by the upregulation of miR-874-3p. In conclusion, miR-874-3p promoted the proliferation and differentiation of hBMSCs by downregulating the expression of LEP, thus inhibiting OP.Abbreviations : miRNAs: microRNAs; OP: osteoporosis; hBMSCs: human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal stem cells; LEP: leptin; DEGs: differentially expressed genes.","990":"MicroRNA (miR)-140-3p has been proved to repress lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and our study aims to further evaluate the mechanism.

The targeting relationship between miR-140-3p and thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Relative expressions of miR-140-3p, TYMS, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition- (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin), angiogenesis- (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), and apoptosis-related factors (cleaved caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)) were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. TYMS was high-expressed yet miR-140-3p was low-expressed in LUAD cells. Upregulation of miR-140-3p inhibited TYMS expression, viability, colony formation, migration, invasion, and tube length within LUAD cells, while downregulation of miR-140-3p did oppositely. Silenced TYMS, the downstream target gene of miR-140-3p, reversed the effects of miR-140-3p downregulation on TYMS expression, cell viability, colony formation, migration, invasion, and tube length as well as the metastasis-, apoptosis- and angiogenesis-related proteins in LUAD cells.

Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and transfer electron microscopy (TEM) were used to observe morphological changes of intestinal tissues of T2DM rats. Insulin and glucose tolerance tests were performed to investigate the influence of curcumin on blood glucose. Curcumin significantly improved the intestinal integrity, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in diabetic rats. The metabolic endotoxemia induced by HFD in diabetic rats was inhibited remarkably.

Nevertheless, it's yet unclear how lncRNA SNHG1 influences breast cancer. Herein, we explored the mechanisms through which SNHG1 modulates breast cancer tumor progression. Our findings demonstrated that SNHG1 is significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues and cells. High SNHG1 levels were closely linked to reduced survival rates in breast cancer patients. SNHG1 silencing has been shown to inhibit the proliferative, migratory, and invasive activity of breast cancer cells. Moreover, SNHG1 silencing enhanced cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity of these cells through improving DDP-induced cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, SNHG1 was found to interact with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), recruiting EZH2 to trigger trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), thus epigenetically inhibiting miR-381 transcription in these cells. Overexpression of miR-381 inhibited tumor progression and sensitized cells to the chemotherapeutic reagent DDP. More importantly, rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-381 inhibition could inverse the tumor-suppressive effect of SNHG1 silencing in breast cancer. In summary, SNHG1 silencing suppressed tumor progression and overcame breast cancer cell DDP resistance via the epigenetic suppression of miR-381 expression. Our study revealed that SNHG1 served as a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer chemoresistance.","998":null,"999":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal type of brain cancer. An increasing number of studies suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in tumor progression. LncRNA HOXD-AS2 was reported to be highly expressed in glioma and associated with glioma grade and poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we first analyzed differentially expressed lncRNAs in glioblastoma using RNA-seq dataset (156 GBM samples and 5 adjacent normal samples in TCGA (Cancer Genome Atlas) and GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) database). HOXD-AS2 was found to be significantly up-regulated in GBM tissues, which was further confirmed in GBM patient tumor samples and GBM cell lines. Silencing HOXD-AS2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis. We further identified and validated miR-3681-5p as a target of HOXD-AS2, and miR-3681-5p was negatively regulated by HOXD-AS2. By negatively affecting miR-3681-5p, HOXD-AS2 could promote the expression of MALT1 to augment the aggressiveness of GBM cells. miR-3681-5p overexpression or MALT1 knockdown attenuated aggressiveness of GBM cells. Importantly, silencing HOXD-AS2 suppressed tumorigenesis of GBM cells in the xenograft mouse model. Collectively, our study clarified the role of miR-3681-5p\/MALT1 axis underlying the oncogenic function of lncRNA HOXD-AS2 in GBM.

This study probes the expression characteristics and function of ITGA11 in GC. Firstly, the ITGA11 profile in GC tissues and paracancerous non-tumor tissues was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot (WB), and the association between ITGA11 and GC patients' clinicopathological indicators was evaluated. ITGA11 knockdown models were set up in GC cell lines MKN45 and AGS. Cell proliferation was determined by the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation assay. WB was utilized to gauge the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl2, Bad, and C-Caspase3) and the PI3K\/AKT pathway. We discovered that the ITGA11 expression was boosted in GC tissues and was related to the unfavorable prognosis of GC patients. Additionally, ITGA11 knockdown abated GC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and enhanced cell apoptosis. In animal experiments, the tumorigenesis of GC cells knocking down ITGA11 was reduced. Mechanically, knocking down ITGA11 notably inactivated the PI3K\/AKT axis. The tumor-suppressive effect mediated by ITGA11 knockdown was attenuated after activating the PI3K\/AKT pathway with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Overall, this study substantiated that the ITGA11 expression was heightened in GC tissues, which affected GC progression by modulating the PI3K\/AKT pathway.","1001":"Cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (CP-AKI) is a severe complication in patients receiving CP chemotherapy. However, effective therapies for CP-AKI are currently lacking. Curcumin (CUR), a natural polyphenol, is extracted from the rhizome of turmeric and has been reported to have nephroprotective activity. However, the role of CUR in CP-AKI remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of CUR in CP-AKI by combining a network pharmacology approach with experimental validations. The analysis revealed 176 potential targets of CUR based on the HERB database and 1,286 related targets of CP-AKI from the GeneCards, DrugBank, and OMIM databases. Further, 106 common targets of CUR against CP-AKI were obtained, and these common targets constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. In addition, the core targets were screened from the PPI network using Cytoscape. Molecular docking revealed that CUR displayed the best binding to AKT1. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the primary biological processes of CUR against CP-AKI included cellular response to chemical stress and apoptotic regulation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was most significantly enriched in CUR against CP-AKI. Western blotting and flow cytometry showed that CUR inhibited apoptosis induced by CP by activating the Akt signaling pathway in human kidney tubular epithelial cells (HK-2). Altogether, our findings demonstrated that CUR alleviated apoptosis by activating the Akt signaling pathway in CP-AKI in vitro. These data provide a scientific basis for future investigations into the clinical application of CUR against CP-AKI.","1002":"Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most common malignancies of the female reproductive system. The miRNA miR-582-3p is associated with a variety of tumors, and the aim of this study was to investigate the role and mechanisms of miR-582-3p specifically in ovarian carcinogenesis and progression. Low expression of miR-582-3p was noted in OC tissue and cell lines, and lower expression of miR-582-3p correlated with lower overall survival in OC patients. Knockdown of miR-582-3p promoted the proliferation and migration of OC cells, while overexpression inhibited them. TUG1, a long non-coding RNA, was found to bind to miR-582-3p, and inhibition of lncRNA TUG1 decreased viability and migration and weakened the effect of miR-582-3p knockdown in OC cells. Implantation of OC cells with reduced miR-582-3p caused increased tumor growth, while lncRNA TUG1 knockdown suppressed tumor growth and relieved the impact of reduced miR-582-3p in vivo. Phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR were significantly enhanced with decreased miR-582-3p expression, but lncRNA TUG1 knockdown attenuated this trend in vitro and in vivo.

Expressions of ER stress activation-related makers including phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), phosphorylated protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (p-PERK), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), and two autophagy markers (ratio of LC3II\/I and Beclin-1) were detected by western blot. Infarct volume, neurological deficits, and brain water content were detected. The results showed that ER stress and autophagy were activated by cerebral (I\/R) injury, which could be effectively attenuated following pre-ischemia isoginkgetin administration. Moreover, autophagy induced by ER stress was triggered by the activation of PERK and IRE1 pathways. ER stress inhibitor (4-PBA) and ER related signaling inhibitors including PERK, GSK, IRE1, and DBSA markedly inhibited ER stress and autophagy induced by I\/R. In addition, isoginkgetin markedly mitigated cerebral infarction, edema, neuronal apoptosis as well as neurological impairment induced by I\/R injury, while tunicamycin (ER stress activator TM) and rapamycin (autophagy activator RAPA) could eliminate these lesions. This research identified a novel therapeutic agent isoginkgetin, which could effectively attenuate I\/R injury by blocking autophagy induced by ER stress.","1004":null,"1005":"To observe the effect of fat-derived pellets (FDP) on wound healing in rats, the inguinal fat of rats was obtained, and the FDP were obtained after centrifugation.

Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were screened, and ceRNA networks associated with TAO were constructed. Thereafter, the genes in the ceRNA network were subjected to functional analyses. Finally, a ceRNA relationship (lncRNA NEAT1-hsa-miR-1-3p-mRNA GNA12) was selected for further validation. Analysis revealed that 347 DE-lncRNAs (150 downregulated and 197 upregulated) and 16 DE-miRNAs (3 downregulated and 13 upregulated) were identified in TAO. Further, TAO-associated ceRNA networks, which included 219 lncRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 53 mRNAs, were proposed and subjected to gene annotation and pathway analysis. Additionally, NEAT1 and GNA12 levels were significantly upregulated, while miR-1-3p levels were evidently downregulated in TAO patients, as compared with those in healthy controls. Dual luciferase reporter assays showed that NEAT1, miR-1-3p, and GNA12 interacted with each other.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expressions of circ_0048764, microRNA-1296-5p (miR-1296-5p), and tripartite motif containing 14 (TRIM14) in BC tissues and cell lines. Besides, the status of proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of BC cells was probed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU, transwell and flow cytometry assays. Western blot was adopted to examine the level of TRIM14 protein in BC cells. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were conducted to corroborate the targeting relationships between miR-1296-5p and circ_0048764 or TRIM14. It was revealed that circ_0048764 expression was remarkably up-regulated in BC tissues and cells, and circ_0048764 expression was associated with TNM stage and tumor size. Functionally, overexpression of circ_0048764 significantly promoted BC cell proliferative, migrative and invasive abilities and inhibited apoptosis, while circ_0048764 knockdown exerted the opposite effects.

Higd-1a promotes the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells and the growth of pancreatic cancer; however, no similar observations have been reported for colorectal cancer (CRC). This study, therefore, aimed to verify the role of Higd-1a in CRC. We downloaded data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases and identified an association between Higd-1a levels in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) tissues and poor survival using Kaplan-Meier curves. Subsequently, we overexpressed Higd-1a in the human COAD cell line HCT-8, knocked down Higd-1a expression in SW480 cells, and evaluated the effects via quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting. MTT assays, colony formation assay, cell cycle analysis, annexin V-FITC\/PI, wound-healing analysis, and transwell assay were used to test cell proliferation, formation of cell colonies, cell cycle progression, migration, invasiveness, and apoptosis. Higd-1a has low transcription levels in COAD tissue and suggests a poor prognosis. Higd-1a overexpression in HCT-8 cells weakened cell proliferation, formation of cell colonies, cell cycle progression, migration ability, and invasiveness, and increased apoptosis. Moreover, the decrease of Higd-1a in SW480 cells induced cell proliferation, formation of cell colonies, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion, and inhibited apoptosis. Higd-1a is underexpressed in COAD cells and its overexpression impaired the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of COAD cells.","1014":null,"1015":"The dysregulation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) has been proved to be involved in the carcinogenesis of various cancers. Nevertheless, the biological function of circSLC7A6 remains unclear in Wilms' tumor (WT). In our study, we found that circSLC7A6 was upregulated in cancerous WT tissues and cells. Cell apoptosis was increased while cell viability, migration, and invasion were repressed by circSLC7A6 silencing. Besides, circSLC7A6 knockdown suppressed WT tumor growth in vivo. miR-107 was identified as a direct target of circSLC7A6, and circSLC7A6 could negatively regulate miR-107 expression. In addition, circSLC7A6 knockdown inhibited WT progression, while the effect was partially abolished by the downregulation of miR-107. Additionally, ABL proto-oncogene 2 axis (ABL2) was verified as a downstream gene of miR-107, and circSLC7A6 could upregulate ABL2 expression by serving as a ceRNA of miR-107. Moreover, functional assays revealed that ABL2 overexpression reversed the impact of circSLC7A6 depletion on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of WT. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that circSLC7A6 facilitated WT progression by upregulating ABL2 through inhibiting miR-107 expression. These results suggested that circSLC7A6 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for WT.","1016":"N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modifications in human messenger RNAs (mRNAs). This study aimed at investigating the function and mechanism of demethyltransferase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in prostate cancer(PCa). The expression level of FTO in PCa was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Besides, the impacts of FTO on the proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells were also detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and transwell assays. Furthermore, we also explored the potential mechanism of FTO in PCa. The results showed that FTO expression was decreased in PCa, and the low expression of FTO showed an obvious relevance to the clinical characteristics. Downregulation of FTO facilitated the proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth of PCa cells. Besides, MC4R displayed a remarkably high expression in PCa tissues, whose expression and m6A level were regulated by FTO. Meanwhile, the in vitro experiments revealed that highly expressed FTO partially reversed the facilitating effect of highly expressed MC4R on the malignant phenotype of PCa cells. Overall, FTO was downregulated in PCa and its expression level showed a relevance to the prognosis of PCa patients.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and sponging microRNAs (miRNAs) serve as key regulators in the biological processes of OC. We sought to evaluate the effect of the RHPN1-AS1-miR-485-5p-DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) axis in regulating OC progression. RHPN1-AS1, miR-485-5p, and TOP2A levels in OC tissues and cells were determined by RT-qPCR. The interaction of RHPN1-AS1\/miR-485-5p\/TOP2A was assessed using luciferase, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assays. RHPN1-AS1 silencing allowed us to explore its biological function by measuring cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in OC cells. In vivo experiments were performed to verify the in vitro findings. We found that the RHPN1-AS1 and TOP2A levels were significantly enhanced, whereas the miR-485-5p levels were reduced in OC tissues and cells. RHPN1-AS1 silencing attenuated cell growth, facilitated apoptosis in OC cells, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Notably, RHPN1-AS1 negatively regulating miR-485-5p promoted the TOP2A expression in OC cells.

MiR-543 was identified as playing an active part in the development of breast cancer involving multiple molecules. The goal of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of the involvement of miR-543 in the development of breast cancer. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) or Western blotting was used to detect mRNA or protein expression. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), and the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), wound healing, and Transwell assays were the main experimental procedures. Furthermore, subcutaneous tumor formation experiments were conducted to detect the function of miR-543 in breast cancer development in vivo. The match of miR-543 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2T (UBE2T) was detected through a dual-luciferase reporter experiment and RNA pull-down assay. Based on these results, miR-543 exhibited reduced expression in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, whereas UBE2T exhibited high levels. Furthermore, miR-543 directly targeted UBE2T, and a negative correlation between miR-543 and UBE2T was also observed in breast cancer tissues. Moreover, miR-543 overexpression led to inhibition of viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer. Furthermore, miR-543 overexpression undermined the UBE2T promotional effect by inhibiting ERK\/MAPK pathway activity in breast cancer cells. Our study revealed that miR-543 impaired breast cancer progression by targeting UBE2T and downregulating UBE2T expression through the ERK\/MAPK pathway, which suggested that miR-543 and UBE2T might serve as promising therapeutic gene targets for breast cancer in clinical application.","1021":"Lung cancer (LC) is a malignant tumor with the highest incidence in the world, and its specific pathogenesis is still unclear. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of non-coding RNAs that play a key role in the development and progression of various cancers. The expression pattern and function of circRNAs in LC are still not completely distinct. In this study, it was aimed to study the expression and potential mechanism of circ-UBR1 in LC cells. Then it was found that circ-UBR1 was up-regulated in LC cells, and had microRNA (miR)-545-5p binding sites. Meanwhile, it was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay that circ-UBR1 directly bound to miR-545-5p and then repressed its expression. MiR-545-5p was down-regulated in LC cells and refrained its expression by binding to the downstream target gene SSFA2. Knockdown circ-UBR1 or enhancive miR-545-5p repressed A549 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, but accelerated apoptosis. After transfection with circ-UBR1 low expression vector, upregulation of SSFA2 apparently reversed the depression of reduced circ-UBR1 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and the promotion of cell apoptosis. Further tumor xenograft experiments in nude mice also confirmed that knockdown of circ-UBR1 could increase the expression of miR-545-5p, but decrease the expression of SSFA2, thus alleviating the progression of LC in vivo. Therefore, these results fully indicate that circ-UBR1 promotes LC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, but represses apoptosis via the circ-UBR1 axis, which may be a closely related marker and therapeutic target of LC.","1022":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) prostate cancer-associated transcript 18 (PCAT18) is a potential diagnostic target for adenocarcinoma. However, its role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains largely unknown. Based on data from an online database, a significant decline in lncRNA PCAT18 was observed in patients with TNBC subtype compared to a population with normal breast tissue. Patients with TNBC with high PCAT18 levels presented good outcomes. Patients with TNBC with high PCAT18 had a lower rate of lymph node-positive metastasis than those with low PCAT18. PCAT18-upregulation inhibited, while PCAT18-downregulation promoted, migration and expression of matrix metalloproteinases 9\/2 (MMP9\/MMP2) and uridylyl phosphate adenosine (uPA) in TNBC cells. Activating transcription factor 7 (ATF7) was positively associated with PCAT18, and ATF7-inhibition abrogated the anti-migration effects of PCAT18 on TNBC cells. Mechanistically, miR-103a-3p directly targeted and inhibited ATF7 expression. PCAT18 competitively sponges miR-103a-3p, promoting the expression of ATF7. Exogenous PCAT18 was associated with lower incidence of lung metastasis followed by the upregulation of ATF7, which was prevented by the treatment of miR-103a-3p mimics. Collectively, PCAT18 was expressed at low levels in TNBC, and PCAT18 could sponge miR-103a-3p and promote ATF7 expression, resulting in prevention of TNBC metastasis. Thus, PCAT18 can serve as a predictive factor for patients with metastatic TNBC.","1023":null,"1024":null,"1025":null,"1026":"The identification of innovative gene biomarkers with clinical efficacy is warranted for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

The differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) of AMI were screened, and the downstream microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs of lncRNA antisense for X-inactive-specific transcript (lncRNA TSIX) were predicted accordingly. The diagnostic relationship between the 12 differentially expressed lncRNAs and AMI was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Next, the expressions of 12 lncRNAs, including miR-34a-5p and retinol binding protein 2 (RBP2) were all detected. The targeting relationships of miR-34a-5p with lncRNA TSIX and RBP2 were verified. AMI model was established and treated with Ad-TSIX and\/or agomiR-34a-5p to evaluate the cardiac function and cardiomyocyte apoptosis of AMI mice. LncRNA TSIX was identified as the most differentially expressed lncRNA in AMI. Our findings revealed that LncRNA TSIX could function as an AMI diagnostic marker. LncRNA TSIX could target miR-34a-5p and miR-34a-5p could target RBP2. Upregulation of lncRNA TSIX could ameliorate cardiac injury inflicted by AMI and mitigate cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Upregulation of miR-34a-5p reversed the effect of lncRNA TSIX overexpression to ameliorate cardiomyocyte apoptosis in AMI mice. Overall, the overexpression of lncRNA TSIX inhibits cardiomyocyte apoptosis by competing with RBP2 to bind to miR-34a-5p and promoting RBP2.","1027":"Immune response imbalance and cardiac dysfunction caused by sepsis are the main reasons for death in sepsis. This study aimed to confirm the expression and diagnostic possibility of microRNA-381-3p (miR-381-3p) and its mechanism in sepsis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were used to reveal the levels and clinical significance of miR-381-3p. Pearson correlation was conducted to provide the correlations between miR-381-3p and several indexes of sepsis. The H9c2 cell models were constructed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was applied to establish the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat models. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry were the methods to detect the cell viability and death rate of H9c2. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to evaluate the concentration of inflammatory cytokines. The target gene of miR-381-3p was validated via the luciferase report system. The low expression of miR-381-3p was found in the serum of patients with sepsis. The lessened miR-381-3p could be a marker in the discrimination of sepsis patients. Overexpression of miR-381-3p could repress the mRNA expression of HMGB1, inhibit the cell apoptosis and inflammatory response, and motivate the viability of sepsis cells. At the same time, enhanced miR-381-3p promoted the inhibition of inflammation and cardiac dysfunction in the rat model of sepsis. Collectively, reduced levels of serum miR-381-3p can be used as an index to detect sepsis patients. MiR-381-3p restored the inflammatory response and myocardial dysfunction caused by sepsis via HMGB1.","1028":"Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) are regarded as an ideal source for clinical use. Increasing evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) work as a crucial regulator in the development of plentiful diseases, including intrauterine adhesions (IUA). Herein, we investigated the specific impacts of UCMSCs overexpressing miR-455-5p in IUA. UCMSCs were cocultured with endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). Thirty-two female mice were divided into four different treated groups: sham, model, model + UCMSC-miR-NC and model + UCMSC-miR-455-5p. Mice in model groups were induced by uterine curettage. MiR-455-5p overexpressed UCMSCs facilitated the proliferation and cell cycle progression of ESCs according to 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay and flow cytometry analysis. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining revealed that miR-455-5p upregulation in UCMSCs increased the number of endometrial glands and suppressed endometrial fibrosis in murine uterine tissues. Western blotting displayed that miR-455-5p overexpressed UCMSCs promoted the activation of Janus kinase\/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK\/STAT3) signaling in ESCs and murine uterine tissues. Mechanistically, miR-455-5p targeted 3' untranslated region of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-455-5p was lowly expressed and SOCS3 was highly expressed in murine uterine tissues of IUA model. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis showed that their expression was inversely correlated. Rescue assays suggested that inhibiting JAK\/STAT3 signaling reversed effects of miR-455-5p on the behaviors of ESCs. The results indicated that miR-455-5p overexpression in UCMSCs helps to attenuate endometrial injury and repair damaged endometrium by activating SOCS3-mediated JAK\/STAT3 signaling.","1029":"As a consequence of expanded science and technical research, the market perception of consumers has shifted from standard traditional to valuable foods, which are furthermore nutritional as well as healthier in today's world.

However, the role of Rho GEFs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains largely unknown. Through the screening of 81 Rho GEFs for their expression profiles and correlations with survival, four of them were identified with strong significance for predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients. The four Rho GEFs, namely ABR, PREX1, DOCK2 and DOCK4, were downregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to normal tissues. The downregulation of ABR, PREX1, DOCK2 and DOCK4, which can be attributfed to promoter methylation, is correlated with poor prognosis. The underexpression of the four key Rho GEFs might be related to the upregulation of MYC signaling and DNA repair pathways, leading to carcinogenesis and poor prognosis. Moreover, overexpression of ABR was shown to have a tumor-suppressive effect in PC9 and H1703 cells. In conclusion, the data reveal the unprecedented role of ABR as tumor suppressor in NSCLC. The previously unnoticed functions of Rho GEFs in NSCLC will inspire researchers to investigate the distinct roles of Rho GEFs in cancers, in order to provide critical strategies in clinical practice.","1035":null,"1036":"Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant tumor with high mortality, but research on its molecular mechanisms remain limited. This study is the first to explore the biological role of nuclear factor NFE2L3 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 3) in GC. We used Western blot and RT-qPCR to detect gene expression at the protein or mRNA level. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) transfection was used to inhibit NFE2L3 expression. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to detect cell proliferation. Cell migration, invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by Transwell assays and flow cytometry. The results showed that NFE2L3 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and promoted gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Inhibiting NFE2L3 expression blocks the cell cycle and increases the proportion of apoptotic cells, whereas NFE2L3 expression promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) process. In summary, NFE2L3 is highly expressed in gastric cancer and promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis and the EMT process.","1037":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes tremors, gait rigidity, and hypokinesia.

StarBase analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay verified the interaction between lncRNA SNHG12 and microRNA-138-5p (miR-138-5p). The effects of suppressed lncRNA SNHG12 and increased miR-138-5p levels on mRNA were determined using quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) treated SH-SY5Y cells. Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, apoptosis, cleaved-Caspase3\/Caspase3 ratio, inflammatory response, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, decreased cell viability, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were observed in MPP+-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Transfection of the lncRNA SNHG12-plasmid reduced neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in MPP+-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells that were rescued by adding the miR-138-5p mimic. These results showed that lncRNA SNHG12 could affect neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in a PD cell model by regulating miR-138-5p expression. TargetScan and dual-luciferase reporter analysis suggested that miR-138-5p targeted nuclear factor I\/B (NFIB). Furthermore, the expression level of NFIB was downregulated after MPP+ stimulation in SH-SY5Y cells. After transfecting with the miR-138-5p inhibitor, NFIB-siRNA, and co-transfecting and detecting NFIB mRNA and protein, we found that miR-138-5p negatively regulated NFIB expression.

Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray showed that GRB7 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1\/CD31) protein expression were positively correlated in ovarian cancer tissues. GRB7 knockdown suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression and reduced VEGFA secretion. The effects of GRB7-silenced SKOV-3 cells on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were evaluated using a transwell cell co-culture model, which showed that knockdown of GRB7 in SKOV-3 cells suppressed HUVEC proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation. Moreover, knockdown of GRB7 in SKOV-3 cells downregulated the expression of proteins associated with angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1\/MEK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1\/2), notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1), and delta-like canonical Notch ligand 4 (DLL4) in HUVECs.

The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) myocardial infarction-associated transcript 2 (Mirt2) has been reported to inhibit inflammation and lipid accumulation; therefore, this study intended to clarify whether Mirt2 served a role in lipid metabolism. THP-1-derived macrophages with or without Mirt2-knockdown or overexpression, were exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), then cell migration, lipid accumulation, cholesterol efflux and inflammation were assessed using wound healing, oil red staining, commercial kits and western blot assays. Besides, ML385 was used to treat THP-1-derived macrophages to inhibit nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2) expression. The expression of proteins involved in the above processes were measured by western blot. Results demonstrated that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) significantly increased Mirt2 expression in THP-1 cells. Mirt2-knockdown enhanced ox-LDL-induced macrophage migration, lipid accumulation, inflammation, and inhibited cholesterol efflux. By contrast, Mirt2 overexpression displayed the opposite effects. Furthermore, Mirt2-knockdown inhibited NRF2 signaling and enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, while Mirt2 overexpression displayed the opposite effects.

Using miRNA-based microarray analysis, we found that miR-34a was overexpressed in cartilage tissues of OA patients relative to patients with acute traumatic amputations. Moreover, its expression was positively correlated with the ECM degradation and inflammation. Mechanistically, miR-34a targeted MCL1, and possible target genes of miR-34a were enriched in the PI3K\/AKT pathway. Furthermore, DNMT3B inhibited miR-34a by promoting miR-34a methylation. Functional experiments using CCK-8, flow cytometry, Safranin O staining, RT-qPCR, ELISA, Western blot, and HE staining revealed that miR-34a inhibitor suppressed ECM degradation and inflammatory response of chondrocytes and cartilage tissues. By contrast, downregulation of DNMT3B and MCL1 reversed the repressive effects of miR-34a inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our findings establish that silencing of miR-34a by DNMT3B could effectively reduce chondrocyte ECM degradation and inflammatory response in mice by targeting MCL1 and mediating the downstream PI3K\/AKT pathway.

Knockdown of KDM2B reduced cell viability and colony forming ability in SK-MES-1 and NCI-H520 cells. KDM2B inhibition reduced glucose consumption, lactate production, ATP level, and also downregulated the expression of LDHA and GLUT1. KDM2B knockdown decreased the protein expression of LC3-I and p62, and increased LC3-II and Beclin-1. Furthermore, KDM2B silencing inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and P70S6K. KDM2B knockdown led to reduced tumor size in mouse model. In conclusion, KDM2B is upregulated in LUSC tissues and cell lines. KDM2B silencing inhibits glycolysis and promotes autophagy through inactivation of the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling pathway.","1046":null,"1047":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common primary liver tumor with increasing incidence worldwide. Metabolic reprogramming caused by metabolic related gene disorders is a prominent hallmark of tumors, among which Glycogen Synthase 2 (GYS2) is the key gene responsible for regulating cellular energy metabolism, and its expression disorders are closely related to various tumors and glycometabolic diseases. However, we still know nothing about its role in ICC. This study is intended to reveal the functional role of GYS2 in the ICC progress and explore the underlying mechanism. Based on the integrated pan-cancer analysis of GYS2 in the GEPIA database, the expression of GYS2 in paired ICC and adjacent non tumor tissues was detected by qPCR. It was found that the expression of GYS2 was significantly down-regulated in ICC. Further analysis showed that its low expression was not only associated with the degree of pathological differentiation, tumor size, microvascular invasion and lymph node metastasis, but also an independent risk factor for unfavorable prognosis. Functional studies have shown that GYS2 overexpression can significantly impair the proliferation, replication, cloning, migration and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells, while the silencing GYS2 dramatically promotes the development of the aforementioned phenotypes, the underlying mechanism may be that GYS2 activates the P53 pathway.

Hence, soil health restoration is a need of the hour. It is known that microorganisms play a vital role in remediation of soil pollutants like heavy metals, pesticides, hydrocarbons, etc. However, the indigenous microbes have a limited capacity to degrade these pollutants and it will be a slow process. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can catalyze the degradation process as their altered metabolic pathways lead to hypersecretions of various biomolecules that favor the bioremediation process. This review provides an overview on the application of bioengineered microorganisms for the restoration of soil health by degradation of various pollutants. It also sheds light on the challenges of using GMOs in environmental application as their introduction may affect the normal microbial community in soil. Since soil health also refers to the potential of native organisms to survive, the possible changes in the native microbial community with the introduction of GMOs are also discussed. Finally, the future prospects of using bioengineered microorganisms in environmental engineering applications to make the soil fertile and healthy have been deciphered. With the alarming rates of soil health loss, the treatment of soil and soil health restoration need to be fastened to a greater pace and the combinatorial efforts unifying GMOs, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, and other soil amendments will provide an effective solution to soil heath restoration ten years ahead.","1053":"Exosome-encapsulated microRNAs (miRNAs) are novel diagnostic and predictive markers in colon cancer.

In the study, miR-223-3p levels in 42 patients with intra-articular fracture and 40 patients with hand fracture were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR reaction (qRT-PCR). Subsequently, osteoblasts MC3T3-E1 was transfected with miR-223-3p mimic or inhibitor, and cell function was detected by Cell counting kit (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter assay verified the regulation mechanism of miR-223-3p and its target genes. We found that miR-223-3p was significantly elevated over time in patients with intra-articular fracture and hand fracture compared with healthy individuals. Moreover, increased miR-223-3p significantly reduced cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) was the target of miR-223-3p. Serum FGFR2 was significantly decreased in patients, which was contrary to the expression of miR-223-3p. Moreover, FGFR2 levels in cells were negatively regulated by miR-223-3p.

Initially, the expression of lncRNA-LUADT1 and TEAD1 were significantly up-regulated in NPC tissues and cells, while miR-1207-5p was significantly down-regulated. Next, miR-1207-5p was confirmed to bind to lncRNA-LUADT1 or TEAD1 by bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assay. In addition, after interfering with lncRNA-LUADT1 expression, experiments of CCK8, EDU staining, and Transwell invasion were used to detect proliferation, invasion, and migration of NPC cells. The results showed that interfering with lncRNA-LUADT1 expression could inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of NPC cells. Western blot showed that lncRNA-LUADT1 knockdown significantly decreased the expression of Hippo\/YAP pathway protein (YAP1 and TAZ). However, interfering with the expression of miR-1207-5p reversed these results. In addition, the nude mouse tumor formation experiment suggested that low-expressed lncRNA-LUADT1 reduced the volume and weight of tumor tissues. In summary, lncRNA-LUADT1 down-regulation could inhibit NPC cell proliferation and invasion, which may be achieved through regulating miR-1207-5p expression and affecting TEAD1 expression, thus inhibiting the activation of Hippo\/YAP signaling pathway.","1092":"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common cancer types of head and neck cancer, accounting for 95% of all cases. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of OSCC remain unclear. Circular RNA (CircRNA) has been extensively studied in the past decades and is a promising direction for the development of OSCC therapeutic targets. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of circMTO1 in OSCC progression. First, we validated the characterization and expression of circMTO1 in OSCC. It was found that circMTO1 was upregulated in OSCC tumor tissues and cells. Subsequently, we conducted biological experiments. It was found that circMTO1 knockdown inhibited OSCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, we conducted a series of experiments to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. A novel circMTO1\/miR-320a\/ATRX axis was identified. Our results suggest that circMTO1 modulates ATRX expression to accelerate OSCC progression by sponging miR-320a. Moreover, we found that circMTO1 expression in OSCC was transcriptionally regulated by Zinc Finger Protein 460 (ZNF460). Our study showed a novel ZNF460\/circMTO1\/miR-320a\/ATRX signaling in OSCC development.","1093":"Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. Increasing evidence suggests that circular RNA (circRNA) exerts critical functions in BC progression. However, the roles of circRNA septin 9 (circSEPT9) in BC development and the underneath mechanism remain largely unclear so far. In this work, the RNA levels of circSEPT9, microRNA-149-5p (miR-149-5p) and solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Western blot was performed to check protein expression. Glutamine uptake, cell proliferation and cell apoptosis were investigated by glutamine uptake, cell counting kit-8, cell colony formation, 5-Ethynyl-29-deoxyuridine, flow cytometry analysis or DNA content quantitation assay. The interactions of miR-149-5p with circSEPT9 and SLC1A5 were identified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Mouse model assay was carried out to analyze the effect of circSEPT9 on tumor formation in vivo. Results showed that circSEPT9 and SLC1A5 expression were significantly upregulated, while miR-149-5p was downregulated in BC tissues and cells as compared with paracancerous normal breast tissues and human normal breast cells. Knockdown of circSEPT9 or SLC1A5 inhibited glutamine uptake and cell proliferation, but induced cell apoptosis in BC cells. SLC1A5 overexpression relieved circSEPT9 silencing-induced repression of BC cell malignancy. In mechanism, circSEPT9 regulated SLC1A5 expression by sponging miR-149-5p. In support, circSEPT9 knockdown led to delayed tumor tumorigenesis in vivo. In summary, these results indicates that circSEPT9 may act an oncogenic role in BC malignant progression by regulating miR-149-5p\/SLC1A5 pathway, providing a novel mechanism responsible for BC development.","1094":null,"1095":"Cisplatin (CDDP) has been widely used for glioblastoma treatment. miR-485-5p and E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) dysfunction has been reported in glioblastoma. Nonetheless, whether CDDP affects glioblastoma progression via the miR-485-5p-E2F1 axis requires investigation. The expression of miR-485-5p and E2F1 was investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blotting in glioblastoma tissues and cell lines. The interaction between miR-485-5p and E2F1 was confirmed using a luciferase assay. The malignancy of glioblastoma was detected using Cell Counting Kit-8, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), cell adhesion, flow cytometry, and transwell assays. We identified miR-485-5p downregulation and E2F1 upregulation in glioblastoma, and miR-485-5p inhibited cell growth and elevated cell apoptosis in glioblastoma cells after CDDP treatment. Moreover, miR-485-5p targeting E2F1 repressed cell growth and improved cell apoptosis in glioblastoma cells after CDDP treatment. Our study revealed that CDDP retarded glioblastoma cell development via the miR-485-5p-E2F1 axis, which may be a new direction for glioblastoma therapy.","1096":"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the leading cause of death from gynecological cancer. In this study, we aimed to explore the role and potential mechanism of LIMD2 during the progression of OC. The expression of LIMD2 was analyzed by GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) database. Western blot and real-time PCR were applied to detect the gene expression of LIMD2 in OC cell lines. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, transwell, wound healing assays, and tumor xenograft experiments were used to evaluate the function of LIMD2 in vitro and vivo. Further, the LIMD2-associated pathways in OC were predicted by RNA-seq analysis, and the involvement of the corresponding cell signaling activities were confirmed by Western blot. We found that LIMD2 was high expressed in OC. Additionally, we found that silencing of LIMD2 inhibited OC cell proliferation in vitro and reduced the growth of its xenograft tumors. Moreover, knockdown of LIMD2 significantly decreased the migration of OC cells. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that pathways regulating extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions and focal adhesion signaling, were deregulated by LIMD2. Particularly, we confirmed that reducing LIMD2 could decrease the expression of Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway related molecules. In conclusion, LIMD2 promotes the proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo, potentially through regulating the focal adhesion signaling pathway.","1097":"Dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) are common in human cancers and are involved in the proliferation, promotion, and metastasis of tumor cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the expression and biological function of miR-889-3p in lung cancer (LC). MiR-889-3p and Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1) expression was detected in human LC tissues and cells. The correlation of miR-889-3p with the clinicopathology of LC patients was observed. After the transfection of miR-889-3p and HIPK1-related plasmids in human LC cell line A549, several studies were employed for detection of cell growth. In addition, the targeting of miR-889-3p with HIPK1 was verified. The results clarified miR-889-3p was down-regulated, while HIPK1 was up-regulated in LC tissues. Elevated miR-889-3p or repressed HIPK1 weakened the viability, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, migration of LC cells, whereas strengthened apoptosis. MiR-889-3p targeted HIPK1; MiR-889-3p mediated HIPK1 to affect the proliferation and EMT of LC cells. Therefore, it is concluded that miR-889-3p repressing HIPK1 restrains the proliferation and EMT of LC cells, providing a novel target for LC therapy.","1098":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a vital role in human inflammatory diseases. Our study aimed to investigate the function of lncRNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in otitis media with effusion (OME). The mRNA levels of NEAT1 and miR-495 were measured by RT-qPCR. The protein levels of p38 MAPK were detected by western blot. The levels of inflammatory cytokines were examined by ELISA. CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays were used to evaluate the cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. The interaction between NEAT1 and miR-495 was determined by luciferase reporter and RIP assays. NEAT1 was highly expressed in OME, and silencing of NEAT1 facilitated the cell proliferation and suppressed levels of inflammatory cytokines and cell apoptosis in LPS-induced HMEECs. Moreover, miR-495 was confirmed as a downstream target of NEAT1. Functional assays revealed that NEAT1 promoted the OME by targeting miR-495. It was further demonstrated that NEAT1 could activate the p38 MAPK signaling pathway by regulating miR-495, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor restored the effects of NEAT1 overexpression on the inflammation levels, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Our study revealed that lncRNA NEAT1 served as a ceRNA to activate p38 MAPK signaling by targeting miR-495 in OME, which may offer a new target for OME treatment.","1099":"An early diagnosis and effective prognostic factors would greatly reduce the mortality rate of colorectal cancer (CRC). This research is intended to complete the evaluation of the prognostic value and potential role of miR-1180-3p in CRC. The miR-1180-3p levels were reduced in CRC patients' tissues, blood, and human CRC cell lines. The ability of miR-1180-3p was explored in discrimination of CRC patients and healths and the value in overall survival estimate. The effect of miR-1180-3p dysregulation on the CRC cellular function was investigated. miR-1180-3p is downregulated in CRC tissues, blood and cells than normal ones. This lower expression was correlated with vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. With the use of ROC curve, miR-1180-3p showed discriminating ability in CRC patients and healthy subjects. With the result of Kaplan-Meier analysis and multi-multivariate Cox analysis, miR-1180-3p was an independent predictor for CRC patients' overall survival. Utilizing CCK-8, Transwell and matrigel assays, overexpression of miR-1180-3p reduced cancer cell proliferation and mobility, but induced apoptosis, by targeting COL12A1. miR-1180-3p might function as a suppressor in CRC progression and allowed the discovery of a new biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy target for CRC.","1100":"Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex systemic autoimmune disease, which is difficult to accurately diagnose due to symptom diversity in patients, especially at earlier stages. We tried to find potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs) and related signaling pathways. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 12 individuals (7 individuals from 3 pSS pedigrees and 5 sporadic cases) for whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. SNPs and CNVs were identified, followed by functional annotation of genes with SNPs and CNVs. Gene expression profile (involving 64 normal controls and 166 cases) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) dataset for differentially expression analysis. Sanger sequencing and in vitro validation was used to validate the identified SNPs and differentially expressed genes, respectively. A total of 5 SNPs were identified in both pedigrees and sporadic cases, such as FES, PPM1J, and TRAPPC9. A total of 3402 and 19 CNVs were identified in pedigrees and sporadic cases, respectively. Fifty-one differentially expressed genes were associated with immunity, such as BATF3, LAP3, BATF2, PARP9, and IL15RA. AMPK signaling pathway and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) were the most significantly enriched signaling pathways of identified SNPs. Identified CNVs were associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, mineral absorption, and HTLV-I infection. IL2-STAT5 signaling, interferon-gamma response, and interferon-alpha response were significantly enriched immune related signaling pathways of identified differentially expressed genes. In conclusion, our study found some potential SNPs, CNVs, and related signaling pathways, which could be useful in understanding the pathological mechanism of pSS.","1101":"As a currently identified small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) category, the PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are crucial mediators of cell biology. The human genome comprises over 30.000 piRNA genes. Although considered a new field in cancer research, the piRNA pathway is shown by the existing evidence as an active pathway in a variety of different types of cancers with critical impacts on main aspects of cancer progression. Among the regulatory molecules that contribute to maintaining the dynamics of cancer cells, the P-element Induced WImpy testis (PIWI) proteins and piRNAs, as new players, have not been broadly studied so far. Therefore, the identification of cancer-related piRNAs and the assessment of target genes of piRNAs may lead to better cancer prevention and therapy strategies. This review articleaimed to highlight the role and function of piRNAs based on existing data. Understanding the role of piRNA in cancer may provide perspectives on their applications as particular biomarker signature in diagnosis in early stage, prognosis and therapeutic strategies.","1102":"Thyroid carcinoma is one of the most common endocrine malignancies, in which papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the main pathotype. ANXA1 plays a significant role in many cancer types, but how it works in PTC has not been identified. MYC is a common transcript factor involved in tumorigenesis, development, invasion, and metastasis. The relation between ANXA1 and MYC has not been proved in PTC. In this study, firstly, we analyzed the expression and prognostic value of ANXA1 in pan-cancer using the data from the UCSC database. Then we explore the role of ANXA1 in PTC, including expression, prognostic value, and immune infiltration. In addition, we evaluated the relation between ANXA1 and the transcription factor MYC. Finally, we identified the expression of ANXA1 and MYC and then evaluated their function associated with proliferation and apoptosis in PTC cell lines by CCK8 proliferation and flow cytometry apoptosis experiment. We found that ANXA1 is up-regulated in PTC comparing with normal patients. High expression of ANXA1 was associated with adverse overall survival of PTC. ANXA1 may be regulated by MYC to promote the proliferation of PTC. MYC may regulate the expression of ANXA and thus affect the proliferation of PTC.","1103":"microRNAs (miRNAs), through their regulation of the expression and activity of numerous proteins, are involved in almost all cellular processes. As a consequence, dysregulation of miRNA expression is closely associated with the development and progression of cancers. Recently, DNA methylation has been shown to play a key role in miRNA expression dysregulation in tumors. miRNA-204-5p commonly acts in the suppression of oncogenes in tumors. In this study, the levels of miRNA-204-5p were found to be down-regulated in the astrocytoma samples. miRNA-204-5p expression was also down-regulated in two astrocytoma cell lines (U87MG and LN382). Examination of online databases showed that the miRNA-204-5p promoter regions exist in CpG islands, which might be subjected to differential methylation. Subsequently, we showed that the miRNA-204-5p promoter region was hypermethylated in the astrocytoma tissue samples and cell lines. Then we found that ezrin expression was down-regulated with an increase in miRNA-204-5p expression in LN382 and U87MG cells after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5'AZA) treatment compared with control DMSO treatment. In addition, LN382 and U87MG cells treated with 5'AZA exhibited significantly inhibited cell invasion and migration . In a recovery experiment, cell invasion and migration returned to normal levels as miRNA-204-5p and ezrin levels were restored. Overall, our study suggests that miRNA-204-5p acts as a tumor suppressor to influence astrocytoma invasion and migration by targeting ezrin and that miRNA-204-5p expression is downregulated by DNA methylation. This study provides a new potential strategy for astrocytoma treatment.","1104":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) five prime to Xist (FTX) exerts important functions in human cancer, while its role in retinoblastoma (RB) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of FTX in RB. The expression levels of FTX were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining and colony formation assays. Cell migration and invasion were detected by Transwell assay. The relationship among FTX, microRNA-320a (miR-320a) and with-no-lysine kinase 1 (WNK1) was also investigated. In the present study, we found that the expression levels of FTX were notably elevated in RB tissues and cancer cell lines. Overexpression of FTX exacerbated the aggressive phenotypes (cell proliferation, migration and invasion) of RB cells. Downregulation of miR-320a obviously attenuated the inhibitory effects of knockdown of FTX in RB malignant phenotypes, and knockdown of WNK1 also reversed the impacts of miR-320a inhibitor on malignant phenotypes. In vivo experiments further confirmed that knockdown of FTX efficiently prevents tumor growth in vivo. Our results revealed that FTX promoted RB progression by targeting the miR-320a\/WNK1 axis (graphical abstract), suggesting that FTX might be a novel therapeutic target for RB.","1105":"Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the urinary system. Our research aimed to explore the function and underlying mechanisms of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) PSMA3-AS1 in BC. RT-qPCR was utilized to detect the levels of PSMA3-AS1, miR-214-5p, and PD-L1. ChIP assay was employed to confirm the transcription factor of PSMA3-AS1. Luciferase reporter assay was carried out to demonstrate the relationships between miR-214-5p and PSMA3-AS1 or PD-L1. The diagnostic value of PSMA3-AS1 was evaluated by the ROC curve. CCK-8, wound healing, transwell, and flow cytometry assays were applied to analyze cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Western blotting was used to confirm the expression of cleaved caspase-3. The present study revealed that BC tissues and cells exhibited an increased expression in PSMA3-AS1. High expression of PSMA3-AS1 was related to poor prognosis in BC patients. Then, the area under the ROC curve for PSMA3-AS1 was up to 0.8954. Moreover, ChIP assay elaborated that YY1 could bind to the PSMA3-AS1 promoter region. Furthermore, it was found that that PSMA3-AS1 knockdown repressed BC cell viability and metastasis, and promoted apoptosis. In addition, miR-214-5p was inversely correlated with PSMA3-AS1 or PD-L1 levels. MiR-214-5p deletion reversed the impacts of PSMA3-AS1 deletion on BC progression, and PD-L1 inhibition also abrogated the influence of miR-214-5p deletion in BC development. In conclusion, YY1-induced PSMA3-AS1 exerted an oncogenic function in BC cells via targeting miR-214-5p and enhancing PD-L1, providing potential biomarkers for BC therapy.","1106":null,"1107":null,"1108":null,"1109":null,"1110":"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease featured by cognitive impairment. This bioinformatic analysis was used to identify hub genes related to cognitive dysfunction in AD. The gene expression profile GSE48350 in the hippocampus of AD patients aged &gt;70 years was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 96 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and subjected to Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses; a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The DEGs were enriched in synapse-related changes. A protein cluster was teased out of PPI. Furthermore, the cognition ranked the first among all the terms of biological process (BP). Next, 4 of 10 hub genes enriched in cognition were identified. The function of these genes was validated using APP\/PS1 mice. Cognitive performance was validated by Morris Water Maze (MWM), and gene expression by RT-qPCR, Cholecystokinin (CCK), Tachykinin precursor 1 (TAC1), Calbindin 1 (CALB1) were downregulated in the hippocampus.

This work aimed to investigate expression and role of EME1 in tumorigenesis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunoblot, cell viability and dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNAi and gene transfection, and immunofluorescent staining were performed to assess EME1 regulation in GC tumorigenesis. Further, mouse xenografts were established for in vivo mechanistic studies. EME1 was found to be upregulated in both gastric cancer cells and clinically obtained tumors. Additionally, EME1 levels were strongly associated with the differentiation level of GC and lymph node metastasis. In vivo and in vitro knockdown of EME1 markedly suppressed the proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities of GC cells and enhanced apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest rates. Mechanistically, EME1 modulated Akt\/GSK3B\/CCND1 signaling. MYB may also have contributed to EME1-dependent gastric carcinogenesis. Elevated EME1 expressions may enhance the proliferative and metastatic abilities of GC cells, thereby acting as a tumor-promoting factor via Akt. These findings reveal that EME1 is an important biomarker for GC prognosis and treatment in humans.Abbreviations: Essential meiotic structure-specific endonuclease 1 (EME1); MYB proto-oncogene (MYB); Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8); 4,6-diamimo-2-phenyl indole (DAPI); Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR); Gastric cancer (GC); Immunofluorescence (IF); Small interfering RNA (siRNA); Small hairpin RNA (shRNA); Alpha serine threonine-protein kinase (Akt); Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B); Cyclin D1 (CCND1); Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); Disease-free survival (DFS); Overall survival (OS); Negative controls (NC); American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC); Coding sequence (CDS); Lymph node metastasis (LNM); Tris-Buffered Saline-Tween-20 (TBST); Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP); Electrochemiluminescence (ECL); Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF); Excision repair cross complementation group 1 (ERCC1).","1112":null,"1113":null,"1114":"Sevoflurane (Sev) is a volatile anesthetic that can inhibit tumor malignancy.

In the current study, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed based on metagenomic next-generation sequencing technology, followed by alpha and beta diversity, LEfSe, and co-occurrence network analysis, and random forest model construction. Our results showed that CAP dramatically influenced taxon abundance, and the significant differences in microbiota including Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes and Spirochetes were observed at the phylum level. Co-occurrence network selected out novel modules involved in microbial proliferation-associated pathways. A random forest model screened Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus as potential diagnostic biomarkers with high AUC values. The microbial composition was different between CAP LRTI patients and non-CAP LRTI patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus were strongly associated with increased severity of LRTI with a pneumonia history.

This work was designed to investigate the specific functions of PTPRO\/ ERp44 in the biological behaviors of trophoblast cells and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Constructed siRNA-PTPRO and ERp44 overexpression plasmids were transfected into HTR-8\/SVneo and JEG-3 cells for further functional experiments. Subsequently, the proliferation and invasion of trophoblast cells were identified by performing CCK-8, flow cytometry and transwell assay. In addition, tube formation assay was employed to estimate the angiogenic ability of HUVECs incubated with the conditioned media (CM) of HTR-8\/SVneo or JEG-3 cells. Importantly, the interaction between PTPRO and ERp44 was analyzed through Co-IP. In the current investigation, it was discovered that downregulation of PTPRO notably facilitated the proliferation and invasion of trophoblast cells and induced a stronger in vitro angiogenesis. Moreover, PTPRO interacted with ERp44 to regulate ERp44 expression. ERp44 overexpression suppressed the proliferative, invasive and angiogenic activities of trophoblast cells. As a result, functions of PTPRO knockdown in the biological behaviors of trophoblast cells were partially abrogated upon elevation of ERp44. To sum up, this current research systematically evidenced that PTPRO could regulate the biological behaviors of trophoblast cells by modulating ERp44.

However, the underlying toxicological targets and mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, network pharmacology analysis and in vitro models were integrated to investigate the effect and mechanism of CMN-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity. A total of 88 targets of CMN-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity were predicted. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment (KEGG) analyses suggested that these targets were related to multiple GO terms and signaling pathways. To further investigate underlying mechanism, the top 10 hub targets (Akt1, Tnf, Ptgs2, Casp3, Igf1, Sirt1, Jun, Cat, Il10, and Bcl2l1) were screened. Furthermore, cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays demonstrated that CMN was toxic to HT22 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining revealed that treatment with CMN increased the proportion of apoptotic cells. In addition, the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results indicated that CMN altered the mRNA expression levels of most of the hub targets, with the exceptions of Igf1 and Jun.

However, the specific pathogenesis of asthma remains controversial. This study explored the contribution of DNA methylation to asthma using computer learning methods. Relevant datasets and information related to patients with asthma were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A multivariate linear regression model was established. Differentially expressed genes and DNA methylation sites were identified. The results showed that the expression of 169 genes was significantly different between the two groups. Through differential analysis of methylation and differential analysis of gene expression, 44 differentially expressed genes that may be affected by DNA methylation modification were identified. The results of the multiple linear regression model showed that DNA methylation could explain 9.81% of the variation in gene expression. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes, HLA-DMB, IL4, HLA-DPB1, and CD40LG, were related to the occurrence of asthma, and HLA-DMB expression was significantly reduced in allergic asthma. There was a positive correlation between cg04933135 and HLA-DMB expression, and cg04933135 was a differential site for DNA methylation. Using blood samples from asthma patients, we confirmed that HLA-DMB expression is down-regulated, which may be affected by abnormal DNA methylation.

Currently, Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against immune checkpoints have shown good efficacy for tumor treatment. In this study, we constructed an immune single-chain fragment variable (scFv) library using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 200 patients with a variety of malignant tumors. High affinity scFvs against EphA2 can be easily screened from the immune library using phage display technology. Anti-EphA2 scFvs can be modified into any form of recombinant antibody, including scFv-Fc and full-length IgG1 antibodies, and the recombinant antibody affinity was improved following modification. Among the modified anti-EphA2 antibodies the affinity of 77-IgG1 was significantly increased, reaching a pmol affinity level (10-12). We further demonstrated the binding activity of recombinant antibodies to the EphA2 protein, tumor cells, and tumor tissues using macromolecular interaction techniques, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Most importantly, both the constructed scFvs-Fc, as well as the IgG1 antibodies against EphA2 were able to inhibit the growth of tumor cells to some extent. These results suggest that the immune libraries from patients with malignant tumors are more likely to screen for antibodies with high affinity and therapeutic effect.

Reliable biomarkers to guide treatment decisions for OSCC remain scarce. The purpose of this study was to identify novel prognostic markers regulated by super enhancers in OSCC. Eight modules were obtained by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), among which MEblue module had the highest correlation with tumor stage, alcohol consumption and smoking. There were 41 genes regulated by super enhancers in MEblue module. Functional analysis showed that 41 super enhancer-regulated genes were involved in cancer progression. A total of twenty transcription factors of the 41 genes were predicted. Prognostic analysis of the 41 genes and the top 5 transcription factors showed that patients with high expression of AHCY, KCMF1, MANBAL and TFDP1 had a poor prognosis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that AHCY, KCMF1 and MANBAL were highly expressed in OSCC tissue. Cellular experiment demonstrated that TFDP1 promoted AHCY, KCMF1 and MANBAL expression by binding to the super enhancers of these genes. Knockdown of TFDP1, AHCY, KCMF1 and MANBAL inhibited the proliferation of OSCC cells. In conclusion, AHCY, KCMF1 and MANBAL were recognized as super enhancer-regulated prognostic biomarkers regulated by TFDP1 in OSCC.","1126":"Rapid, inexpensive, and laboratory-free diagnostic of viral pathogens is highly critical in controlling viral pandemics. In recent years, nanopore-based sensors have been employed to detect, identify, and classify virus particles. By tracing ionic current containing target molecules across nano-scale pores, nanopore sensors can recognize the target molecules at the single-molecule level. In the case of viruses, they enable discrimination of individual viruses and obtaining important information on the physical and chemical properties of viral particles. Despite classical benchtop virus detection methods, such as amplification techniques (e.g., PCR) or immunological assays (e.g., ELISA), that are mainly laboratory-based, expensive and time-consuming, nanopore-based sensing methods can enable low-cost and real-time point-of-care (PoC) and point-of-need (PoN) monitoring of target viruses. This review discusses the limitations of classical virus detection methods in PoN virus monitoring and then provides a comprehensive overview of nanopore sensing technology and its emerging applications in quantifying virus particles and classifying virus sub-types. Afterward, it discusses the recent progress in the field of nanopore sensing, including integrating nanopore sensors with microfabrication technology, microfluidics and artificial intelligence, which have been demonstrated to be promising in developing the next generation of low-cost and portable biosensors for the sensitive recognition of viruses and emerging pathogens.","1127":"Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) AGAP2-AS1 has been demonstrated to involve in various malignancies. However, the expression and biological effect of AGAP2-AS1 on glioma remain enigmatic. We aimed to explore the effects of AGAP2-AS1 on glioma. Expressions and relationship of AGAP2-AS1 and microRNA-497-5p (miR-497-5p) in different grades of glioma tissues and cell lines as well as normal ones were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), starBase, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. In addition, the effect of AGAP2-AS1 on the cell biological behaviors, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers, and miR-497-5p level was detected by cell functional experiments, western blot, and qRT-PCR. After transfection with miR-497-5p mimic (M), inhibitor (I), and AGAP2-AS1 knockdown, miR-497-5p level, cell biological behaviors, and EMT-related markers were detected again. AGAP2-AS1 expression was increased while miR-497-5p expression was decreased in glioma tissues and cell lines, and increase of AGAP2-AS1 expression or reduction of miR-497-5p expression was also correlated with clinicopathological grades of glioma. Furthermore, AGAP2-AS1 knockdown repressed cell biological behaviors and EMT-related markers expressions. Mechanically, AGAP2-AS1 targeted miR-497-5p and AGAP2-AS1 knockdown led to elevation of miR-497-5p expression. In addition, rescue experiments were conducted to validate the vital influence of miR-497-5p on the AGAP2-AS1-regulated proliferation and metastasis of glioma. AGAP2-AS1 may serve as an oncogene in the tumorigenesis of glioma by inhibiting miR-497-5p expression, showing its potential as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for glioma.","1128":"Biochar's ability to mediate and facilitate microbial contamination degradation, as well as its carbon-sequestration potential, has sparked interest in recent years. The scope, possible advantages (economic and environmental), and future views are all evaluated in this review. We go over the many designed processes that are taking place and show why it is critical to look into biochar production for resource recovery and the role of bioengineered biochar in waste recycling. We concentrate on current breakthroughs in the fields of engineered biochar application techniques to systematically and sustainable technology. As a result, this paper describes the use of biomass for biochar production using various methods, as well as its use as an effective inclusion material to increase performance. The impact of biochar amendments on microbial colonisation, direct interspecies electron transfer, organic load minimization, and buffering maintenance is explored in detail. The majority of organic and inorganic (heavy metals) contaminants in the environment today are caused by human activities, such as mining and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which can be treated sustainably by using engineered biochar to promote the establishment of a sustainable engineered process by inducing the circular bioeconomy.","1129":"miRNAs are broad participants in vertebrate biological processes, and they are also the major players in pathological processes. miR-125a-5p was recently found a modulator in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Our study was aimed to explore the role and underlying mechanisms of miR-125a-5p-abundant exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) on OA progression. We separated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) as well as the exosomes from traumatic OA patients. The immunofluorescence and cartilage staining were implemented for the observation and the assessment on endocytosis of chondrocytes and exosomal miR-125a-5p efficacy to cartilage degradation. Dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to verified the relationship between miR-125a-5p and E2F2. Then, the function of exosomal miR-125a-5p were examined on chondrocyte degeneration in vitro and in vivo. Our findings indicated that E2F2 expression was elevated while the miR-125a-5p was down in traumatic OA cartilage tissue, showing a negative correlation of the former and the latter. miR-125a-5p targets E2F2 in traumatic OA cartilage tissue and leads to the down-expression of E2F2. The E2F2 expression in chondrocytes was decreased after internalization of exosomes. We additionally found that BMSCs-derived exosomes were rich in miR-125a-5p content and chondrocytes can have it internalized. miR-125a-5p is endowed with a trait of accelerating chondrocytes migration, which is going along with the up-expressions of Collagen II, aggrecan and SOX9 and the down-expression of MMP-13 in vitro. Besides that, the mice model with post-traumatic OA turned out that exosomal miR-125a-5p might beget an alleviation in chondrocyte extracellular matrix degradation. All these outcomes revealed that BMSCs-derived exosomal miR-125a-5p is a positive regulator for chondrocyte migration and inhibit cartilage degeneration We thus were reasonable to believe that transferring of exosomal miR-125a-5p is a prospective strategy for OA treatment.","1130":"Microalgae have been recognized as one of the most efficient microorganisms to remediate industrial effluents. Among microalgae diatoms are silica shelled unicellular eukaryotes, found in all types of water bodies and flourish very well even in wastewater. They have their silica cell wall made up of nano arrayed pores arranged in a uniform fashion. Therefore, they act as smart nanocontainers to adsorb various trace metals, dyes, polymers, and drugs which are hazardous to human as well to aquatic life.

In this work it was found that compared with adjacent normal tissues, circSOX13 and the microtubule-associated protein RP\/EB family member 1 (MAPRE1) were signally up-regulated in NSCLC while miR-3194-3p was signally lowered. Pulmonary function tests (PETs) revealed that knocking down circSOX13 or overexpressing miR-3194-3p inhibited NSCLC proliferation, invasion and migration but promoted its apoptosis. The promoting effect of overexpressing circSOX13 on NSCLC was reversed via knocking down MAPRE1. Additionally, knocking down circSOX13 reduced cisplatin resistance in NSCLC. Furthermore, circSOX13 mediated MAPRE1 expression via competitively binding miR-3194-3p to exert its tumorigenic impact. To conclude, this work clarified the carcinogenic impact of circSOX13-miR-3194-3p-MAPRE1 axis on NSCLC and DDP resistance.

This study was designed to determine whether RFT would provide protective effects on sepsis-induced intestinal injury.The determination of cell viability and inflammation of LPS-treated IEC-6 cells influenced by RFT was conducted by Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), RT-qPCR, and western blot, while the detection of LDH, diamine oxidase (DAO), and intestinal-type fatty acid binding proteins (I-FABP) was conducted for determining the intestinal cytotoxicity in these cells. The apoptosis of these cells was detected by TUNEL, with autophagy-related protein expression measured by western blot to confirm whether autophagy was activated. Finally, the aforementioned assays were conducted again after 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, was used on these cells to investigate whether RFT exerted its effects on LPS-treated IEC-6 cells via modulation of autophagy.RFT alleviates LPS-induced IEC-6 cell inflammation, cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and autophagy-related proteins were expressed at higher levels when RFT was used on these cells. Nevertheless, further treatment of 3-MA weakened the restorative impacts of RFT on the inflammation, cytotoxicity and apoptosis of these cells.To conclude, this paper is the first to present evidence that RFT attenuates sepsis-induced intestinal injury by inducing autophagy, which will provide instructions for the future investigations into the use of RFT in treatment of intestinal injury.","1137":null,"1138":"Biosurfactants are natural surfactants produced by a variety of microorganisms.

In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of miR-934 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis in CRC. Accordingly, miR-934 was found to be over-expressed in SW480 and HCT116 cells, two typical CRC cell lines. Meanwhile, miR-934 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in SW480 and HCT116 cells. It was further validated that miR-934 knockdown displayed an inhibitory effect on cell migration and invasion in SW480 and HCT116 cells. Additionally, miR-934 deficiency markedly decreased VEGF expression in SW480 and HCT116 cells and suppressed capability of CRC cells to promote tube formation in vascular endothelial cells, which suggests the pro-angiogenesis role of miR-934 in vitro. Dual luciferase reporter assay further showed that miR-934 directly bound to B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of circCNOT2 on BC invasion, migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its potential molecular mechanism. The results assured that circCNOT2 and Twist Family BHLH Transcription Factor (TWIST1) were elevated in BC, while microrNA (miR)-409-3p was reduced. CircCNOT2 was positively correlated with TWIST1 and negatively correlated with miR-409-3p. Elevated circCNOT2 is associated with poor prognosis of BC. Knockdown circCNOT2 or augmented miR-409-3p could promote apoptosis but repress proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT of BC cells. In addition, overexpression of circCNOT2 or TWIST1 accelerated BC invasion, migration and EMT, which could be reversed by simultaneous transfection of miR-409-3p-mimic. Further dual luciferase reporting and RNA-pull down assay clarified that circCNOT2 acted as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-409-3p to mediate TWIST1 expression.

We showed that 2 weeks of Valsartan administration (30 mg\/Kg body weight) mitigated the increased permeability of the brain-blood barrier and the reduction of gap junction proteins VE-Cadherin and Claudin 2. In human brain microvascular cells (HBMVECs), we found that Valsartan treatment ameliorated high glucose-induced hyperpermeability by measuring Dextran uptake and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Furthermore, Valsartan treatment recovered high glucose-repressed endothelial VE-Cadherin and Claudin 2 expression. Moreover, Valsartan significantly suppressed the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) against high glucose. Mechanistically, Valsartan ameliorated high glucose-repressed endothelial cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) signaling activation. The blockage of CREB activation by PKA inhibitor H89 abolished the action of Valsartan, suggesting its dependence on CREB signaling. In conclusion, Valsartan shows a neuroprotective effect in diabetic mice by ameliorating BBB dysfunction. These effects of Valsartan require cellular CREB signaling in brain endothelial cells.","1166":"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to malignant features. Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) FENDRR has been shown to regulate tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. However, the effects of FENDRR on the CSC-like traits of colorectal cancer cells remain to be elucidated. Here, we identified that lncRNA FENDRR level was remarkably lower in spheres formed by colorectal cancer cells compared to that in parental cancer cells. Further functional experiments showed that FENDRR overexpression attenuated the CSC-like traits of colorectal cancer spheres, while FENDRR knockdown conferred the CSC-like traits for colorectal cancer cells, as characterized by the alteration of ALDH activity, sphere-formation ability, and expression of stemness markers (Oct4, Sox2, and KLF4). RNA-RNA interaction in vitro analysis combined with mRNA stability assay revealed that lncRNA FENDRR directly interacted with Sox2 mRNA 3'UTR, reduced its mRNA stability and thus inhibited Sox2 expression. In addition, lncRNA FENDRR-mediated effects on the CSC-like traits of colorectal cancer cells depended on Sox2 expression. This work suggests that lncRNA FENDRR can block the CSC-like traits in colorectal cancer cells through directly interacting with Sox2 mRNA 3'UTR.","1167":"Cholesteatoma of the middle ear is a kind of cystic disease with clear boundary formed by the abnormal growth of keratosquamous epithelium in temporal bone. Cholesteatoma otitis caused by it is a common disease in otorhinolaryngology. The EPR effect promotes the selective distribution of macromolecular substances in tumor tissues, which can increase drug efficacy. The purpose of this paper is to prepare and deliver the mir34a small molecule regulator, rubine, by nanotechnology, and to deliver it to the cells successfully. It can passively target tumor tissue through EPR effect, and play its regulatory role on miR-34a, thus inhibiting the growth of cholesteatoma cells. The effects of nano delivery on apoptosis and PIEN\/P13K\/AKt of children with middle ear choledochoma were tested in this paper. The experimental results were conducted on cholesteatoma cells as cell lines and balb\/c nude mice as experimental objects. The expression of PTEN\/PI3K\/AKT in experimental group and control group was detected by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was discussed by cell activity detection. The physical and chemical properties, encapsulation efficiency, drug release ability in vitro and antitumor activity of nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo were studied. The results of cell level experiments in vitro showed that free RUBINE caused about 15% apoptosis, which was not different from RC NPs. The results showed that the nanoparticles could improve the expression of miR-34 in the cells, and then regulate the expression of Bcl-2, Cdk6 and CyclinD1, and play the inhibitory effect of miR-34a on the proliferation and migration of tumor cells.","1168":"T-regulatory (Treg)\/T-helper 17 (Th17) imbalance is associated with preeclampsia (PE). Herein, we aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of lncRNA NEAT1 on the Treg\/Th17 balance. The levels of nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), miR-485-5p, and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) in CD4+ T cells were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Treg and Th17 cells were examined using flow cytometry. The relationship between miR-485-5p and NEAT1 or AIM2 was assessed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation. All the data indicated that NEAT1 was upregulated in PE. The number of Treg cells decreased and was negatively related to NEAT1, whereas the number of Th17 cells increased and was positively related to NEAT1 in PE. Knockdown of NEAT1 increased the Treg cells and Treg\/Th17 but decreased Th17 cells. Furthermore, NEAT1 sponges miR-485-5p to suppress the target AIM2 levels. Inhibition of miR-485-5p or upregulation of AIM2 abrogated the effect on Treg\/Th17 balance induced by knockdown of NEAT1. In conclusion, silencing of NEAT1 promoted Treg\/Th17 balance via the miR-485-5p\/AIM2 axis in PE, suggesting that NEAT1 is a potential target for the treatment of PE.","1169":"Several widely recognized metabolites play a role in regulating the pathophysiological processes of various disorders. Nonetheless, the lack of effective biomarkers for the early diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and premature ovarian failure (POF) has led to the discovery of serum-based metabolic biomarkers for these disorders. We aimed to identify various differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) through serum-based metabolic profiling in patients with PCOS and POF and in healthy individuals by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, heatmap clustering, correlation, and Z-score analyses were performed to identify the top DEMs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enriched pathways of DEMs were determined using metabolite-based databases. Moreover, the clinical significance of these DEMs was evaluated on the basis of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Significantly dysregulated expressions of several metabolites were observed in the intergroup comparisons of the PCOS, POF, and healthy control groups. Furthermore, 6 DEMs were most frequently observed among the three groups. The expressions of these DEMs were not only directly correlated but also exhibited potential significance in patients with PCOS and POF. Novel metabolites with up\/downregulated expressions can be discovered in patients with PCOS and POF using serum-based metabolomics; these metabolites show good diagnostic performance and can act as effective biomarkers for the early detection of PCOS and POF. Furthermore, these metabolites might be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of PCOS and POF via interplay with corresponding genes.","1170":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that is increasing in incidence worldwide. RA is regulated by a variety of microRNAs (miRNAs\/miR). Moreover, analysis of public data has revealed that miR-4423-3p is significantly downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of RA patients. This study investigated the role of miR-4423-3p in RA. The levels of miR-4423-3p and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) in RA patients and the regulatory relationship between miR-4423-3p and MMP13 were analyzed using public data. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify that miR-4423-3p targets MMP13 in human fibroblast-like synoviocyte (HFLS) RA cells (HFLS-RA). Following the overexpression of miR-4423-3p, miR-4423-3p inhibitor, and MMP13 in HFLS-RA, viability, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and invasion\/migration assays were used to detect the effects of miR-4423-3p targeting MMP13 on cell biological processes. The results revealed that miR-4423-3p was downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of RA patients and MMP13 was upregulated in synovial tissue of RA patients. miR-4423-3p targets the 3' untranslated region of MMP13 and downregulates MMP13 expression. After overexpression of miR-4423-3p, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited, the cell cycle was prevented and cell apoptosis was promoted. Overexpression of MMP13 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while accelerating the cell cycle process and suppressing apoptosis. The findings indicate that in HFLS-RA cells, overexpression of miR-4423-3p inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis by negatively regulating MMP13. The overexpression of miR-4423-3p might be a novel strategy for the treatment of RA.","1171":null,"1172":"Gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) is a common malignant tumor, accounting for 95% of gastric cancers. However, the effects and regulatory mechanisms of long non-coding RNA TRPM2-AS (TRPM2-AS) in GAC have not been fully explored. Our study investigates the action mechanism of TRPM2-AS in GAC. After performing quantitative Real-Time polymerase chain reaction or western blotting, we found that the levels of TRPM2-AS and Plasminogen Activator, Urokinase (PLAU) were upregulated in GAC, whereas the level of miR-138-5p was downregulated. Cell function experiments proved that silencing TRPM2-AS suppressed proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in GAC cells. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assay identified the interaction between TRPM2-AS, miR-138-5p, and PLAU. In addition, the inhibitory effect of silencing TRPM2-AS on GAC cells could be partially relieved by PLAU overexpression. In conclusion, our study revealed that TRPM2-AS sponging miR-138-5p to upregulate PLAU could contribute to GAC progression, which might be useful for identifying biomarkers for GAC therapy.AbbreviationGastric adenocarcinoma (GAC); Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA); lncRNA TRPM2 antisense RNA (TRPM2-AS); Plasminogen Activator, Urokinase (PLAU); Wild-type (WT); mutant (MUT).","1173":null,"1174":"LYAR (Ly-1 antibody reactive) is a transcription factor with a specific DNA-binding domain, which plays a key role in the regulation of embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. However, the role of LYAR in human cancers remains unclear. This study aimed to analyze the prognostic value of LYAR in cancer. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of LYAR in various tumors. We research found that, compared with normal tissues, LYAR levels werehigher in a variety of tumors. LYAR expression level was associated with poor overall survival, progression-free interval, and disease-specific survival. LYAR expression was also related to tumor grade, stage, age, and tumor status. Cell counting kit-8, Transwell, and wound healing assay showed that knocking out LYAR significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, this study found that LYARexpression was significantly positively correlated with MKI67IP, BZW2, and CCT2.

The Nudix hydroxylase (NUDT) genes have been reported to play notable roles in tumor progression. However, the role of NUDT10 in GC has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the expression of NUDT10 in GC and its association with clinicopathological characteristics. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas and Human Protein Atlas databases were performed to determine NUDT10 mRNA and protein expression. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic value of NUDT10 in patients with GC. We used Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess the correlations between clinicopathological factors and survival outcomes of patients with GC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify the underlying signaling pathways. NUDT10 mRNA and protein expression was significantly lower in GC tissues compared to normal tissues. Interestingly, higher NUDT10 expression was correlated with advanced tumor stage, deeper local invasion, and worse survival outcomes. Patients with higher NUDT10 expression had a significantly worse prognosis than those with lower NUDT10 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that high NUDT10 expression was an independent predictor of survival outcome. Several pathways, including mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, and cancer signaling, were identified as enriched pathways in GC through GSEA.

However, the molecular mechanism of the hsa-miR-150-5p-PYCR1 axis in nasopharyngeal cancer remains unclear. To identify the mechanism of the hsa-miR-150-5p-PYCR1 axis, the expression of hsa-miR-150-5p and PYCR1 in nasopharyngeal cancer tissues and cells was first measured by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The luciferase and RNA pull-down assays were used to confirm the interaction between hsa-miR-150-5p and PYCR1. The overexpression of hsa-miR-150-5p and PYCR1 was detected by cell viability, proliferation, western blotting, migration, and invasion in nasopharyngeal cancer cells. The expression levels of hsa-miR-150-5p was reduced in the nasopharyngeal cancer tissues and cells and were negatively correlated with the PYCR1 levels. The upregulation of hsa-miR-150-5p significantly repressed cell growth and promoted apoptosis. However, the upregulation of PYCR1 expression significantly promoted nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis, which could abolish the inhibitory effect of hsa-miR-150-5p. In conclusion, we clarified that hsa-miR-150-5p attenuated nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis by reducing the PYCR1 expression levels. This provides a new perspective of nasopharyngeal cancer involving both hsa-miR-150-5p and PYCR1 for the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer.","1179":"The cold-shock protein Y-box-binding protein (YB)-1 regulates the expression of various chemokines and their receptors at the transcriptional level. Expression of the orphan chemokine CXCL14 is repressed by EGF induced signaling. The possible links between EGF-mediated YB-1 and CXCL14 as well as the functions of critical kinase pathways in the progression of prostate cancer have remained unexplored. Here we examined the correlation between YB-1 and CXCL14, and the ERK\/AKT\/mTOR pathways in prostate cancer. Knockdown of YB-1 decreased cyclinD1 expression with an upregulation of cleaved-PARP in human prostate cancer cells. EGF treatment upregulated phospho-YB-1 expression in a time-dependent manner, while treatment with an ERK inhibitor completely silenced its expression in prostate cancer cells. EGF treatment stimulates CyclinD1 and YB-1 phosphorylation in an ERK-dependent pathway. Positive and negative regulation of YB-1 and CXCL14 was observed after EGF treatment in prostate cancer cells, respectively. EGF rescues cell cycle and apoptosis via the AKT and ERK pathways. Furthermore, YB-1 silencing induces G1 arrest and apoptosis, while knockdown of CXCL14 facilitates cell growth and inhibits apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. YB-1 and CXCL14 were inversely correlated in prostate cancer cells and tissues. A significant association between poor overall survival and High YB-1 expression was observed in human prostate cancer patients. In conclusion, our data reveal the functional relationship between YB-1 and CXCL14 in EGF mediated ERK signaling, and YB-1 expression is a significant prognostic marker to predict prostate cancer.","1180":"Osteosarcoma, derived from primitive mesenchymal cells, is the most common primary solid malignant tumor of bone. The cause of osteosarcoma remains unclear. In recent years, the role of non-coding sequences in regulating protein expression in tumors has been paid more and more attention, especially long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). We speculate that SRY-box transcription factor 21 antisense divergent transcript 1 (SOX21-AS1) can regulate the expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) through sponging hsa-mir-7-5p and hsa-mir-145-5p. We knocked lncRNA SOX21-AS1 into the genome of 143B cells through CRISPR\/Cas9, then screened out a monoclonal cell line. Detect the transcription level and protein expression level of the above-mentioned related genes, and cell proliferation. Then, ginsenoside Rg3 was added to culture the cell line knocked into lncRNA SOX21-AS1, and the expression levels of lncRNA SOX21-AS1, hsa-mir-7-5p, hsa-mir-145-5p, mTOR, and KLF4 were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Cell proliferation method detects cell viability, explores the molecular mechanism of lncRNA SOX21-AS1 in osteosarcoma, and checks whether it can be used as a potential drug target for the treatment of osteosarcoma. Our results demonstrate that the overexpression of lncRNA SOX21-AS1 up-regulates mTOR and KLF4 by sponging hsa-mir-7-5p and hsa-mir-145-5p, and ultimately regulates the proliferation of osteosarcoma. It is proved that ginsenoside Rg3 can inhibit the cell proliferation of osteosarcoma by reducing the expression level of lncRNA SOX21-AS1.

Surface plasmon resonance assay, thrombin cleavage assay and plasma stability test were performed for screening the optimal HEX peptide with enhanced albumin-binding affinity, controlled-release as well as plasma stability. The in vivo anti-diabetic efficacies of the selected candidate were further assessed via both acute and chronic pharmacodynamic evaluation in diabetic model animals.

Cell viability, apoptosis, fluorescence intensity of GFP-LC3 and RFP-GFP-LC3 were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, and Laser scanning confocal microscope analysis, respectively. The levels of LC3II\/LC3I, P62 and ATG4D were detected by Western blot.

The learning and memory ability and the levels of nerve growth factor (NGF)\/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were evaluated and determined. The levels of G9a\/histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and the enrichment level of H3K9me2 in the promoter region of BDNF gene were analyzed. After SF post-treatment, the neurons in cerebral cortex, the learning and memory skills and the contents of NGF\/BDNF were increased, while the apoptosis and G9a\/H3K9me2 levels were reduced. After overexpression of G9a in vitro\/vivo, the enrichment levels of H3K9me2 in the promoter region of BDNF were increased, the levels of BDNF were decreased, the neurons were damaged and the learning and memory abilities of HIE rats were impaired. The conclusion is that SF post-treatment can promote the expression of BDNF by inhibiting H3K9me2 on the BDNF gene promoter and inhibiting G9a, thus alleviating HIE in rats.","1188":"During the initial stage of liver regeneration (LR), hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) initiate regeneration in a hypoxic environment.

In this study, first, we found that the proliferation ability of primary LSECs treated with hypoxia was enhanced compared with the control group, and then whole transcriptome sequencing was performed to screen 1837 differentially expressed (DE) genes and 17 DE miRNAs. Subsequently, the bioinformatics method was used to predict the target genes of miRNAs, and 309 pairs of interacting miRNA-mRNA pairs were obtained. Furthermore, the miRNA-gene action network was established using the negative interacting miRNA-mRNA pairs. The selected mRNAs were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and biological processes (BP) and signal pathways related to LSEC proliferation that were significantly enriched in GO-BP and KEGG were selected.

The mRNA levels of NEAT1, miR-511, and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group A Member 2 (NR4A2) were detected by RT-qPCR. The protein levels of exosomal markers were examined by western blot. ELISA was used to assess the levels of GM-CSF, eotaxin-1, and MUC5AC. The cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK-8 and TUNEL assays. In this study, we found that the NEAT1 level was highly expressed in AR and IL-13-treated HNECs. NEAT1 interference significantly suppressed levels of GM-CSF, eotaxin-1, and MUC5AC and apoptosis rate, but promoted the viability of IL-13-treated human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs). Moreover, exosomes containing NEAT1 induced inflammatory cytokine production and apoptosis, while NEAT1 depletion abrogated these effects. In addition, NEAT1 directly interacted with miR-511, and the inhibition of miR-511 partially restored the inhibitory effects of NEAT1 silencing on inflammatory cytokine, mucus production, and apoptosis in IL-13-stimulated HNECs. Furthermore, miR-511 could bind to the 3'UTR of NR4A2, and the inhibition of miR-511 increased levels of inflammatory factors and apoptosis rate, which was counteracted by depleting NR4A2. In conclusion, our data revealed that exosomal NEAT1 contributed to the pathogenesis of AR through the miR-511\/NR4A2 axis. These findings might offer novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of AR.","1190":"Osteoporosis is defined as a bone condition characterized by bone mass reduction, bone micro-architectural and quality deterioration, leading to compromised strength and increased chances of fracture.

Alizarin Red Staining (ARS) and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were used to determine the miR-15a-5p role in osteogenic differentiation. Finally, Wnt pathway inhibitor was used to determine the miR-15a-5p\/PDCD4\/Wnt signaling pathway in regulating osteogenic differentiation. We found miR-15a-5p expression was increased in human osteoporosis specimens and during differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. PDCD4 was also identified as a target of miR-15a-5p and was found to be involved in osteogenic differentiation. Further, miR-15a-5p mimics attenuated the effects of PDCD4 overexpression. Finally, use of XAV939 (Wnt pathway inhibitor) downregulated osteogenic differentiation in miR-15a5p\/PDCD4\/Wnt-dependent signaling pathway.

Phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K) and phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) protein levels were measured by western blotting. LINC00958 and LEMD1 were found to have increased, while the expression of miR-3064-5p was decreased in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines. Silencing of LINC00958 hampered cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion, while enhancing the apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. Notably, LINC00958 inhibited miR-3064-5p and promoted LEMD1; the miR-3064-5p inhibitor abrogated the effect of LINC00958 silencing in colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, LEMD1 knockdown inhibited the activation of PI3K\/AKT signaling. Our analyses have shown that LINC00958 could facilitate the progression of colorectal cancer by sponging miR-3064-5p and releasing LEMD1, leading to the activation of the PI3K\/AKT pathway.

The proliferation of HGC27 and KATO III cells was measured using a colony formation assay. Flow cytometry was performed to examine the changes in cell apoptosis. Western blotting was conducted to detect the expression of zinc finger protein 587 (ZNF587) protein in HGC27 and KATO III cells. To confirm the relationship between miR-4537 and ZNF587, a luciferase reporter assay was performed. MiR-4537 was downregulated in GC tumors and cells and suppressed cell proliferation, while promoting cell apoptosis in GC. Importantly, we found that miR-4537 reduced the radioresistance of GC cells. In addition, we also confirmed that miR-4537 expression is negatively correlated with ZNF587 expression in GC tissues. MiR-4537 bound to ZNF587 and suppressed the expression level of ZNF587. Overexpression of ZNF587 partially counteracted the effects of miR-4537 on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion, in GC cells, miR-4537 inhibited the ability of cell proliferation, but on the contrary, it promoted the ability of cell apoptosis and improved radiosensitivity of the cells.","1193":null,"1194":null,"1195":null,"1196":"Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonist, is known to inhibit the atherosclerosis of apoE mice and suppress the cellular behaviors of VSMCs induced by AngII.

METTL3 inhibition downregulated the miR-20a-5p expression. Moreover, miR-20a-5p upregulation facilitated ESCA cell invasiveness and migration by targeting NFIC transcription. METTL3 inhibition suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Overall, METTL3 promoted m6A modification and the binding of DGCR8 to miR-20a-5p to further elevate the miR-20a-5p expression and inhibit NFIC transcription, thus promoting EMT, invasion and migration.","1201":null,"1202":null,"1203":null,"1204":null,"1205":null,"1206":null,"1207":"Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women globally, and chemoresistance is a major challenge to disease treatment that is associated with a poor prognosis. This study was formulated to identify a reliable prognostic biosignature capable of predicting the survival of patients with chemoresistant breast cancer (CRBC) and evaluating the associated tumor immune microenvironment. Through a series of protein-protein interaction and weighted correlation network analyses, genes that were significantly associated with breast cancer chemoresistance were identified. Moreover, univariate Cox regression and lasso-penalized Cox regression analyses were employed to generate a prognostic model, and the prognostic utility of this model was then assessed using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Finally, The CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE algorithms were additionally leveraged to assess relationships between the tumor immune microenvironment and patient prognostic signatures. Overall, a multigenic prognostic biosignature capable of predicting CRBC patient risk was successfully developed based on bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments. This biosignature was able to stratify CRBC patients into high- and low-risk subgroups. ROC curves also revealed that this biosignature achieved high diagnostic efficiency, and multivariate regression analyses indicated that this risk signature was an independent risk factor linked to CRBC patient outcomes. In addition, this signature was associated with the infiltration of the tumor microenvironment by multiple immune cell types. In conclusion, the chemoresistance-associated prognostic gene signature developed herein was able to effectively evaluate the prognosis of CRBC patients and to reflect the overall composition of the tumor immune microenvironment.","1208":null,"1209":"To explore the function of transcription factor 3 (TCF3) on the proliferation and apoptosis of Burkitt lymphoma cells and its mechanism. qRT-PCR was performed to determine the expression of TCF3, histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), and microRNA-101 (miR-101) in the Burkitt lymphoma (BL) tumor tissues and lymph node tissues with reactive lymph node hyperplasia (RLNH). We found that the expression of TCF3 and HDAC3 was up-regulated in BL tumor tissues and lymphoma cells, and the miR-101 expression was down-regulated. And TCF3 and HDAC3 were negatively correlated with the expression of miR-101, respectively. In addition, knockdown of TCF3 can inhibit BL cell proliferation, reduce cell viability and promote cell apoptosis, retain the cell cycle in the G0\/G1 phase, and inhibit the expression of Akt\/mTOR pathway-related proteins (p-Akt and p-mTOR). When miR-101 was overexpressed, the results were the same as when TCF3 was knocked down. Moreover, we used Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) to detect the interaction between TCF3 and HDAC3, and performed the Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment to detect the enrichment of TCF3 and HDAC3 in the promoter region of miR-101. We found that TCF3 can interact with HDAC3 and is enriched in the miR-101 promoter region. In conclusion, TCF3 combined with HDAC3 down-regulates the expression of miR-101, thereby promoting the proliferation of BL cells and inhibiting their apoptosis.","1210":"The present study was targeted at investigating the effects of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1094 on breast cancer (BC) cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle and its related mechanism.

With transfection, LINC01094 and miR-340-5p expressions were selectively up-regulated or down-regulated in BC cell lines, and then cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and flow cytometry assays. Bioinformatics was utilized to predict the targeted relationships between miR-340-5p and LINC01094, as well as miR-340-5p and E2F3 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR), and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were employed to validate them. It was revealed that, LINC01094 expression was enhanced in BC cells and tissues, and LINC01094 overexpression promoted BC cell proliferation, accelerated cell cycle progression, and inhibited apoptosis while knocking down LINC01094 worked oppositely. LINC01094 directly targeted miR-340-5p and negatively regulated its expression in BC cells. Besides, E2F3 was substantiated to be the target gene of miR-340-5p, and E2F3 expression could be indirectly and positively modulated by LINC01094. All in all, LINC01094 promotes BC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and inhibits apoptosis via modulating miR-340-5p\/E2F3 molecular axis.","1211":"Myocardial injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion is the main pathological manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is characterized by high mortality and morbidity. Thus, there's an urgent need to develop efficacious strategies and elucidate the underlying mechanisms to prevent or alleviate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury to improve the clinical outcomes in patients. In this study, we took advantage of a typical myocardial cell line of mice (HL-1) and cultured with or without an aquaporin 4 inhibitor (TGN-20 denoted as AQP4i) under normal conditions (NC), ischemia (IS) and ischemia reperfusion (IR), respectively. The cytomorphology, ultrastructure, cell vitality and expression pattern of apoptotic proteins were verified with scanning electron microscope (SEM), immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR and western-blotting analysis, respectively. HL-1 under IS or IR condition revealed higher expression of Aquaporin 4 (Aqp4) compared to the NC group, whereas showed similarity in cytomorphology and ultrastructure. Aqp4 inhibition was sufficient to improve the apoptotic cells in HL-1 while showed minimal effects to the other cellular vitality. Furthermore, the expression pattern of apoptotic proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins together with proinflammatory factors in HL-1 was effectively rescued by Aqp4i treatment both at the mRNA level and protein level. Ischemia and ischemia reperfusion caused higher expression of Aqp4 and resultant increase of cardiomyocyte pyroptosis. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury of HL-1 was effectively alleviated by Aqp4 and pyroptosis inhibition. Our findings provided new references for myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury management via targeting Aqp4-mediated pyroptosis of cardiomyocyte.","1212":"The microRNA miR-130a-3p (miR-130a-3p) has anti-tumor activity against numerous cancer types. Further, miR-130a-3p may target Wnt signaling, which is a critical pathway regulating tumorigenesis. Functions of miR-130a-3p in colorectal cancer (CRC) and contributions of Wnt1 pathway modulation, however, have not been examined, hence the exploration on these two aspects. In this study, in comparison with normal controls, both CRC tissue and multiple CRC cell lines showed downregulated miR-130a-3p. MiR-130a-3p overexpression contributed to a decrease in CRC cell proliferation. Additionally, its overexpression also caused reduced expression of WNT Family Member 1 (WNT1) and downstream WNT pathway factors c-myc and cyclin D1. Dual-luciferase assay revealed WNT1 as a direct target of miR-130a-3p, and further the inhibitory effect of miR-130a-3p on c-myc and cyclin D1 was proved to be reversed by overexpressed WNT1.

Circular RNA forkhead box P1 (circFOXP1) can regulate cell activities in different types of diseases. However, its effects on trophoblastic cells and its role in RPL development remain unknown. In this study, gene expressions were detected by RT-qPCR. Protein levels were detected by Western blotting. Trophoblastic cell viability, apoptosis, invasion, and migration were respectively analyzed via CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell assays. The association between miR-143-3p and circFOXP1 or S100A11 (S100 calcium binding protein A11) was explored and confirmed by bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assay. Herein, miR-143-3p was upregulated in RPL. Furthermore, miR-143-3p upregulation induced apoptosis and suppressed proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, and metastatic capabilities of trophoblastic cells; whereas, miR-143-3p inhibition exert opposite effects. MiR-143-3p targeted S100A11 and was adversely regulated by circFOXP1 expression. S100A11 inhibition partially offset the effect of miR-143-3p knockdown on trophoblastic cell viability, apoptosis, EMT, invasion, and migration. In addition, circFOXP1 competitively combined with miR-143-3p, thus regulating S100A11 expression. Moreover, circFOXP1 regulated trophoblastic cell functions through the miR-143-3p\/S100A11 cascade. To sum up, our study, for the first time, demonstrated that circFOXP1 could improve dysfunction of trophoblastic cells through the miR-143-3p\/S100A11 axis, providing novel biomarkers and diagnostic targets for RPL.","1214":null,"1215":"The study aimed to investigate the significant potential role of miR-877-5p in Prostate cancer.

Univariate and LASSO regression analysis were used to obtain survival-related IRGs. Finally, the prognostic signature was constructed using multivariate regression analysis. The laboratory experiments were conducted to verify the key IRG expression. Immune cells infiltration was analyzed using the CIBERSORT algorithm and TIMER database. Prognostic signature containing four IRGs (ADA2, TLR1, PTPN6, S100P) was constructed with good predictive performance; in particular, S100P played a significant role in the immune microenvironment, and tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer. Moreover, we found that CD8+ T cell and activated CD4+ memory T cell tumor infiltration was lower in the high-risk group, while high-risk score correlated positively with higher tumor mutational burden, and the higher half inhibitory centration 50 of chemotherapeutic agents Docetaxel and Sunitinib.

We measured the expression of ORM1 in breast cancer tissues and cell lines using qRT-PCR. A colony formation assay was done to assess cell proliferation and Transwell and wound healing assays were performed to determine the migration and invasion capacity of the cells, respectively. In addition, a CCK-8 assay was used to measure epirubicin cytotoxicity and western blot assays were done to analyze the putative mechanisms of epirubicin sensitivity. We found that the expression of ORM1 was upregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The expression of ORM1 enhanced the proliferation and migration of the cell lines. In contrast, down-regulation of ORM1 inhibited the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and activation of the AKT\/ERK signaling pathway.

Considerable evidence has illustrated that abnormally expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are in a close correlation with the initiation and progression of various tumors, including HCC. LncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 22 (SNHG22) has been reported to play important roles in tumor initiation, but its role and mechanism are little known in HCC. In our report, we discovered the high level of SNHG22 in HCC tissues and cells, and the high expression of SNHG22 was correlated with unfavorable clinical outcome in HCC patients. Functional assays implied that SNHG22 deficiency suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in vitro. Additionally, it was also confirmed that silenced SNHG22 suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Mechanistic exploration revealed that SNHG22 recruited DNMT1 to miR-16-5p DNA promoter through EZH2 and inhibited miR-16-5p transcription via DNA methylation. Finally, we verified that the suppression of miR-16-5p countervailed the suppressive effect of SNHG22 deficiency on HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Conclusively, this study clarified the SNHG22\/EZH2\/DNMT1\/miR-16-5p axis and revealed that SNHG22 could be an underlying biomarker for HCC.","1220":"Apoptosis of lens epithelial cells contributed to the formation of age-related cataract (ARC), and previous data revealed that circular RNA (circRNA) was responsible for the underneath mechanism.

Thus, this study explored the role of NNT-AS1 in ccRCC. We evaluated NNT-AS1 expression in ccRCC specimens. Next, CCK-8 and Transwell assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation and metastatic abilities. The interaction between miR-137 and NNT-AS1 or Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX-1) was confirmed using a dual luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that NNT-AS1 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC specimens compared with normal tissues. Inhibition of NNT-AS1 restrained ccRCC proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, NNT-AS1 acted as a competitive endogenous RNA to sponge miR-137, which depressed ccRCC cells proliferation and metastasis. Moreover, with the use of bioinformatics analysis, the famous oncogene YBX-1 was selected as the potential target of miR-137. Luciferase assay also confirmed the interaction between miR-137 and YBX-1. Further functional studies demonstrated that the inhibition effect of NNT-AS1 knockdown on ccRCC carcinogenesis could be partially reversed by overexpression of YBX-1, suggesting that NNT-AS1 promotes ccRCC progression through the miR-137\/YBX-1 pathway.

We then performed cluster analysis and LASSO regression analysis on these autophagy-related genes in KIRC. In the cluster analysis, we successfully divided patients with KIRC into five clusters and found that there was a clear correlation between the classification and two clinicopathological features: tumor, and stage. In LASSO regression analysis, we used 13 genes to create a new prognostic-related risk model in KIRC. The model showed that the survival rate of patients with KIRC in the high-risk group was significantly lower than that in the low-risk group, and that there was a correlation between this grouping and the patients' metastasis, tumor, stage, grade, and fustat. The results of the ROC curve suggested that this model has good prediction accuracy.

Nevertheless, the contribution of circRNAs to osteosarcoma remains largely unclear. Results indicated that expression of circATRNL1 was higher in osteosarcoma tissues and cells. The high-expression of circATRNL1 was significantly correlated with aggressive features and acted as an independent risk factor for osteosarcoma patients' overall survival. Functionally, our findings demonstrate that circATRNL1 promotes the osteosarcoma aerobic glycolysis in vitro. Mechanistically, circATRNL1 up-regulated the expression level of LDHA, which was also targeted by miR-409-3p. Therefore, circATRNL1 exerted the accelerative roles of osteosarcoma aerobic glycolysis through miR-409-3p\/LDHA axis. In conclusion, circATRNL1 promoted osteosarcoma progression by enhancing glycolysis via circATRNL1\/miR-409-3p\/LDHA axis, which may inspire a novel therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.","1241":null,"1242":"The present work aimed to explore LINC00839 expression level and its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and identify the downstream molecular mechanisms. qRT-PCR (Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR) and western blot were employed to detect mRNA and protein levels. Functional investigations were performed by flow cytometric-based apoptosis assay, CCK8 (Cell Counting Kit-8) assay, clone formation assay, Transwell migration and invasion assay. Functional interactions between LINC00839 and miR-144-3p or miR-144-3p and WTAP were validated by dual luciferase reporter assay. siRNA (small interfering RNA) was used for LINC00839 silencing, and microRNA mimic or inhibitor were employed to modulate miR-144-3p activity. LINC00839 was upregulated in HCC cells and tissues. Silencing LINC00839 suppressed the proliferation, invasion, migration of HCC cells and induced apoptosis. Additionally, LINC00839 served as a sponge to negatively impact on miR-144-3p activity, which contributed to the high expression of WTAP (WT1 Associated Protein) and the malignant phenotype of HCC cells. Our study revealed an oncogenic role of LINC00839 in HCC, and identified miR-144-3p\/WTAP axis as downstream effectors mediating the oncogenic function of LINC00839. LINC00839 might serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for HCC.","1243":"Previous studies have explored the association between protein-coding genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, the influence of the miR-199a-3p\/anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) axis in LUAD has not yet been fully explored. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the underlying roles of AGR2 and miR-199a-3p in the development of LUAD. The expression levels of miR-199a-3p and AGR2 in LUAD tissues and cells were detected via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A luciferase assay was also performed to identify the interaction between AGR2 and miR-199a-3p. Moreover, the cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and adhesion assays were used along with flow cytometry to verify the malignancy of LUAD in vitro, while a xenograft tumor assay was performed to confirm the tumor growth in vitro. The findings showed a decrease in the expression of miR-199a-3p in LUAD. Additionally, miR-199a-3p overexpression inhibited the growth of LUAD cells in vitro and in vivo, while elevating the apoptosis rate of the cells. AGR2 knockdown had the same effect in the cells as that of miR-199a-3p overexpression. It was also found that miR-199a-3p directly targeted AGR2 in LUAD cells to suppress tumorigenesis. In conclusion, this study suggests that miR-199a-3p plays an anti-tumorigenic role in LUAD by targeting AGR2. Moreover, our study provides insights into the development of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of LUAD.","1244":"Neuropathic pain is a kind of pain caused by damage to somatosensory nervous system. Currently, neuropathic pain is still a medical problem for clinicians. Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2B (Ube2b) is validated to be implicated with nerve function, but whether Ube2b can play a role in neuropathic pain is still elusive. In this work, we constructed chronic constriction injury (CCI) rat model by ligating the left sciatic nerve, Ube2b protein expression was confirmed to be decreased in spinal cord tissues of CCI rats via Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Moreover, Ube2b elevation alleviated the thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical hyperalgesia in CCI rats according to paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) and paw withdrawal mechanic threshold (PWMT). In addition, Hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed that Ube2b elevation suppressed chronic sciatic nerve injury. All these data suggested that Ube2b could ameliorate neuropathic pain in CCI rats. Mechanically, Ube2b upregulation elevated the protein level of Kcna2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 2) and decreased the protein level of DNMT3a (DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha). Ube2b elevation could increase Kcna2 expression via suppressing DNMT3a. Rescue assays unveiled that Ube2b overexpression modulated-mechanical hyperalgesia and thermal hyperalgesia were reversed by Kcna2 depletion, indicating that Ube2b alleviated neuropathic pain via mediating Kcna2 via the regulation of DNMT3a. In summary, we found that Ube2b elevation ameliorated neuropathic pain through regulating Kcna2, which might offer a novel biomarker for the therapies of neuropathic pain.","1245":null,"1246":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative disease in middle-aged and elderly people. Our previous study has proved that microRNA-7 (miR-7) exacerbated the OA process. This study was aimed to explore the downstream genes and mechanism regulated by miR-7 to affect OA. Multiple EGF-like-domains 9 (MEGF9) was the predicted target of miR-7 by databases. Luciferase report experiment results confirmed that MEGF9 could bind to miR-7. Among the 10 collected pairs of OA and healthy samples, the expression levels of miR-7 and MEGF9 were both up-regulated when compared with healthy subjects by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The increased MEGF9 levels were due to the interaction with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by co-immunoprecipitation. Evaluations found that upregulation of miR-7 or MEGF9 can increase the expression of EGFR, matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and a disintegrin like and metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS-5), so as to aggravate cartilage degradation. In addition, this effect induced by miR-7\/EGFR\/MEGF9 axis was by activation of PI3K\/AKT signaling. The IHC and western blot assay results on OA model mice also demonstrated that miR-7\/EGFR\/MEGF9 axis regulated cartilage degradation in vivo. In summary, miR-7\/EGFR\/MEGF9 axis may perform a crucial function in the regulation of OA, providing potential for OA treatment.","1247":null,"1248":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by most of the cells or tissues and act as nanocarriers to transfer nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. The blood system is the most abundant source of extracellular vesicles for purification, and it has attracted considerable attention as a source of diagnostic biomarkers. Blood-derived extracellular vesicles, especially vesicles released from erythrocytes and platelets, are highly important in nanoplatform-based therapeutic interventions as potentially ideal drug delivery vehicles. We reviewed the latest research progress on the paracrine effects and biological functions of extracellular vesicles derived from erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and plasma. From a clinical perspective, we summarize selected useful diagnostic biomarkers for therapeutic intervention and diagnosis. Especially, we describe and discuss the potential application of erythrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles as a new nano-delivery platform for the desired therapeutics. We suggest that blood-derived extracellular vesicles are an ideal nanoplatform for disease diagnosis and therapy.","1249":null,"1250":"Osteoporosis is a progressive bone disease in the elderly and lacks an effective classification method of patients. This study constructed a gene signature for an accurate prediction and classification of osteoporosis patients. Three gene expression datasets of osteoporosis samples were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus database with pre-set criteria. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and diseased osteoporosis samples were screened using Limma package in R language. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established based on interaction data of the DEGs from the Human Protein Reference Database. Classification accuracy of the classifier was assessed with sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) using the pROC package in the R. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on feature genes with clusterProfiler. A total of 310 differentially expressed genes between two samples were associated with positive regulation of protein secretion and cytokine secretion, neutrophil-mediated immunity, and neutrophil activation. PPI network of DEGs consisted of 12 genes. A SVM classifier based on five feature genes was developed to classify osteoporosis samples, showing a higher prediction accuracy and AUC for GSE35959, GSE62402, GSE13850, GSE56814, GSE56815 and GSE7429 datasets. A SVM classifier with a high accuracy was developed for predicting osteoporosis.

Although associated with low malignancy, it is often accompanied by myasthenia gravis resulting in poor prognosis. Due to the dual factors of tumor immune tolerance and autoimmune reaction, it is urgent to understand the immune status of MG with thymoma. In this study, RNA sequencing data were obtained from the TCGA and GEO cohorts to identify differentially expressed messenger RNAs and infiltrated immune cells. A total of 121 samples in TCGA and 43 samples in GEO were screened out. The infiltrated immune cells were identified by CIBERSORT, in which Tfh cells and activated DC cells were abnormal in thymoma patients. The differently expressed genes were performed by package LIMMA. The functional characteristics of differently expression genes were analyzed by GO and KEGG; one GO and seven KEGG pathways were both found in both TCGA and GEO cohorts. Meanwhile, 27 common differently expressed genes were obtained and were displayed by a Venn diagram. The TRRUST was used to screen the hub genes for the common 27 different genes and 6 genes were found. Then, PPI networks were constructed. Subsequently, the relationship between SCNAs of common genes and related immune cells tested by TIMER. Kaplan-Meier plots, ROC curve and Cox's expression model for immune infiltration and hub genes were also tested. In conclusion, we found that two types of immune infiltrated cells and six hub genes can predict the occurrence of myasthenia gravis in thymoma patients.","1252":"Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic bone metabolic disease. Promotion of osteoblast proliferation and inhibition of cell apoptosis may be helpful for the prevention and clinical treatment of OP. In the current study, we focused on the expression changes and clinical values of lncRNA ROR and miR-145-5p in OP clinical serum samples, and investigated the interactive modulation effect of ROR\/miR-145-5p on osteoblast function. Serum samples were obtained from 82 OP patients and 79 healthy individuals. MC3T3-E1 was applied for the cell experiments. Levels of lncRNA ROR and miR-145-5p were detected using qRT-PCR. Transient transfection was performed to regulate gene levels in cells, and cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected. A reciprocal correlation between lncRNA ROR and miR-145-5p was explored. LncRNA ROR was downregulated, and miR-145-5p was overexpressed in OP patients. The combined diagnosis of ROR and miR-145-5p showed good diagnostic value for OP. ROR knockdown promoted the MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation. Luciferase reporting assay verified the target relationship between ROR and miR-145-5p. MiR-145-5p downregulation reversed ROR silence mediated effect on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation and apoptosis. LncRNA ROR is downregulated and miR-145-5p is highly expressed in OP patients. ROR knockdown may inhibit osteoblast proliferation via targeting miR-145-5p. It may provide a theoretical basis and experimental basis for ROR to be a potential target for the treatment of OP.","1253":"As a new type of non-coding RNA, the role of circular RNA (circRNA) in various diseases and tumors has received considerable attention. Studies have shown that circRNAs play an important role in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) via different mechanisms. However, the specific underlying molecular mechanism of circRNAs in the proliferation of AML cells remians unclear. This study aimed to clarify the biological role and mechanism of circCRKL in AML. The results indicated low circCRKL expression in AML cell lines and samples. Moreover, the overexpression of circCRKL inhibited the proliferation and colony-forming ability of AML cells, while its silencing promoted them. In addition, bioinformatics tools and luciferase assays revealed that circCRKL could sponge miR-196a-5p and miR-196b-5p to promote the expression of p27. Furthermore, circCRKL inhibited AML cell proliferation via the miR-196a-5p\/miR-196b-5p\/p27 axis, suggesting a potential new target for AML therapy.","1254":null,"1255":"Early 2 factor (E2F) genes encoding a family of transcription factors are significantly associated with apoptosis, metabolism, and angiogenesis in several tumor types. However, the biological functions of E2F transcription factors (E2Fs) and their potential involvement in the malignancy of lower-grade glioma (LGG) remain unclear. We explored the effects of the expression of eight E2F family members on the clinical characteristics of LGG based on the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and GSE16011 datasets. Two LGG subgroups were identified according to the consensus clustering of the eight E2Fs. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm for further functional experiments and the development of a potential risk score. Two categories of patients with LGG were identified based on the median risk scores. We then developed a nomogram based on the results of the multivariate analysis. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry were performed to validate the bioinformatics results. Our results indicated that E2F family members were significantly involved in the malignancy of LGG and might serve as effective prognostic biomarkers of the disease.","1256":"Solute carrier family 39, member 1 (SLC39A1) is a member of the zinc-iron permease family and located to the cell membrane, acting as a zinc uptake transporter. However, the clinical impacts of SLC39A1 in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (EHCC) have not been defined. In this research, we compared the differential expression of SLC39A1 in EHCC and normal tissues based on tissue microarray, and the clinical significance of SLC39A1 in EHCC was evaluated as well. Compared with adjacent tissues, SLC39A1 was remarkably decreased in paired EHCC tissues. Besides, decreased SLC39A1 expression was significantly associated with several clinic-pathological features and serum biochemical indicators. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis exhibited that both overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with low expression of SLC39A1 were notably poorer than that of patients with high expression. Moreover, Cox regression analyses revealed that low expression of SLC39A1 was an independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with EHCC. Subgroup analysis also revealed beneficiary populations benefiting from the prognostic evaluation using SLC39A1 expression. Collectively, we summarized that downregulated expression of SLC39A1 is a worse prognostic factor for patients with EHCC, which can be used as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for EHCC.","1257":"Antibiotics, as antimicrobial drugs, have been widely applied as human and veterinary medicines. Recently, many antibiotics have been detected in the environments due to their mass production, widespread use, but a lack of adequate treatment processes. The environmental occurrence of antibiotics has received worldwide attention due to their potential harm to the ecosystem and human health. Research status of antibiotics in the environment field is presented by bibliometrics. Herein, we provided a comprehensive overview on the following important issues: (1) occurrence of antibiotics in different environmental compartments, such as wastewater, surface water, and soil; (2) toxicity of antibiotics toward non-target organisms, including aquatic and terrestrial organisms; (3) current treatment technologies for the degradation and removal of antibiotics, including adsorption, hydrolysis, photodegradation and oxidation, and biodegradation. It was found that macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides were most frequently detected in the environment. Compared to surface and groundwaters, wastewater contained a high concentration of antibiotic residues. Both antibiotics and their metabolites exhibited toxicity to non-target organisms, especially aquatic organisms (e.g., algae and fish). Fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides can be removed through abiotic process, such as adsorption, photodegradation, and oxidation. Fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides can directly undergo biodegradation. Further studies on the chronic effects of antibiotics at environmentally relevant concentrations on the ecosystem were urgently needed to fully understand the hazards of antibiotics and help the government to establish the permissible limits. Biodegradation is a promising technology; it has numerous advantages such as cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness.","1258":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) CASC9 is reported to be a tumor promoter in oral cancer, but its mechanism in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has not been fully explored. Our study aimed to identify the interaction between lncRNA CASC9, microRNA-545-3p (miR-545-3p), and laminin subunit gamma 2 (LAMC2) in OSCC cells. Our study confirmed that lncRNA CASC9 and LAMC2 were upregulated in OSCC, whereas miR-545-3p expression was reduced. After performing a series of cell functional experiments, it was found that knockdown of lncRNA CASC9 or LAMC2 resulted in the inhibition of proliferation, colony formation, and migration of OSCC cells, but their negative effects could be partly impaired by the miR-545-3p inhibitor. In addition, we proved for the first time that lncRNA CASC9 can sponge miR-545-3p to upregulate LAMC2. In conclusion, our study revealed that lncRNA CASC9 promotes the malignancy of OSCC cells by sponging miR-545-3p to enhance LAMC2 expression, implying that lncRNA CASC9\/miR-545-3p\/LAMC2 may be an intervention approach in OSCC therapy.","1259":null,"1260":null,"1261":null,"1262":null,"1263":"Heterotopic ossification (HO) is frequently seen in patients with spinal injuries. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the association of HO with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) through gene expression profiling. The human transcriptomic datasets (GSE73754 and GSE94683) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database for analysis. Overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between AS and HO disease states. Subsequently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed for constructing and identifying hub genes for each condition. Finally, a consensus of the overlapping DEGs and the hub genes in AS and HO was taken for determining the key genes involved in AS-induced HO. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels in mesenchymal stem cells of AS patients and controls. Additionally, immunohistochemistry was performed on interspinous ligament samples for experimental validation of genes. DEG analysis identified 355 overlapping genes between HO and AS. WGCNA indicated that the salmon module of the 22 modules constructed, was most significantly correlated with AS-induced HO. Subsequently, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of the salmon module indicated the presence of genes enriched in proteasome regulatory particle and proteasome pathways. mRNA expression analysis identified TCP1 and PSMC1 as the key genes in AS-induced HO. Further validation of these genes could help elucidate their role in the complex association of AS and HO.","1264":"Cisplatin resistance remains a major obstacle to effective chemotherapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 3 (CCT3) has been extensively investigated in various cancers, but not in the context of drug resistance. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of CCT3 in cisplatin resistance of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells. By surveying the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) website, we found CCT3 expression to be up-regulated in NSCLCs, which correlated with the poor prognosis of LUAD patients. Furthermore, both mRNA and protein levels of CCT3 were upregulated in the cisplatin-resistant A549\/DDP cells compared to the cisplatin-sensitive A549 cells. Importantly, upon cisplatin treatment, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated CCT3 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of A549\/DDP cells, and induced significant G2\/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in A549\/DDP cells. Moreover, CCT3 knockdown significantly weakened the tumorigenicity of the cisplatin-treated A549\/DDP cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, CCT3 knockdown re-sensitized A549\/DDP cells to cisplatin through inhibiting the Janus kinase 2\/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK2\/STAT3) pathway. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that CCT3 could promote cisplatin resistance of LUAD cells via activating the JAK2\/STAT3 pathway, indicating that CCT3 may be a novel molecular target for overcoming cisplatin resistance in LUAD patients.","1265":"Chitinase-3 like-protein-1 (CHI3L1) has been found to be overexpressed in many cancers and increased CHI3L1 level in serum seems to correlate with a poor prognosis in patients with metastatic cancer. However, the expression of CHI3L1 and its potential role in esophageal cancer remains unclear. We retrieved publicly available RNA-seq datasets of esophageal cancer tissues and normal esophageal tissues. We analyzed the correlation between CHI3L1 expression with different clinical parameters (such as T stages, N stage, response to treatment and tumor residues after treatment), the relationship between CHI3L1 expression level and prognosis, and the relationship between CHI3L1 expression and different immune cell signatures in esophageal cancer tissues. A transgenic mouse model of esophageal carcinoma was used to validate CHI3L1 expression and its association with macrophage signature gene expression. The effect of recombinant CHI3L1 on macrophage polarization was assessed in cell model. We showed the upregulation of CHI3L1 in esophageal cancer tissues in comparison to normal esophageal tissues, and its upregulation was positively associated with tumor size. The analysis of immunological signatures and CHI3L1 expression indicated that CHI3L1 level was highly correlated with increased expression of macrophage signature genes in esophageal tumor tissues. CHI3L1 was also upregulated in the esophagus dysplasia tissues in a transgenic mouse model. Recombinant CHI3L1 treatment favored M2 gene expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. CHI3L1 overexpression may favor macrophage recruitment in esophageal tumor tissues. Future studies are needed to delineate the mechanisms of CHI3L1-mediated macrophage recruitment and polarization in tumor tissues.","1266":"Human stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) is an ortholog of fish stanniocalcins (STCs) and is widely expressed in various organs and tissues. The gene is localized on chromosome 5q33 or 5q35. STC2 has been implicated in glucose homeostasis and phosphorus metabolism. It is also reported to be implicated in various malignancies. STC2 was found to be implicated in breast cancer and gynecologic cancers, suggesting hormone-specific or -dependent activities in these malignancies. Moreover, it was reported to be involved in gastrointestinal tumors, including esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and liver cancers, and respiratory cancers, including laryngeal and lung cancers. It also influenced renal carcinoma and prostate cancer. Notably, as a secreted phosphoprotein, STC2 was detectable in serum and possessed promising predictive value in several malignancies.

For cancer treatment, gene delivery of microbubbles (MB)-mediated microRNA (miRNA) is considered as a promising approach. In this study, our aim is to investigate the effects of MB-mediated let-7b-5p inhibitor on the proliferation and stemness characteristics of ovarian cancer (OVCA) cells. Let-7b-5p inhibitor mediated by MB was prepared (termed MB-let-7b-5p inhibitor), and the effects of MB-let-7b-5p inhibitor and let-7b-5p inhibitor on OVCA cell viability, proliferation and stemness characteristics were investigated. We found that MB-let-7b-5p inhibitor presented a higher transfection efficiency than let-7b-5p inhibitor alone. The inhibitory effect of MB-let-7b-5p inhibitor on OVCA cells was more significant than let-7b-5p inhibitor. Let-7b-5p targeted DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box helicase 19A (DDX19A), which was downregulated in OVCA cells. The downregulation of DDX19A reversed the inhibitory effects of MB-let-7b-5p inhibitor on OVCA cells. To sum up, we found that MB-let-7b-5p suppressed OVCA cell malignant behaviors by targeting DDX19A.","1269":"Neuropathic pain (NP) originating from a dysfunction in the nervous system is often intractable and chronic. Many studies have implicated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the physiological and pathological development of NP. The lncRNA colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed gene (CRNDE) has been shown to mediate NP progression. However, further investigations are needed to gain deeper understanding of the specific mechanisms governing CRNDE in NP etiopathology. In this study, we successfully used chronic constrictive injury (CCI)-induced rats to establish an NP model with intrathecal injection, and confirmed the upregulation of CRNDE in CCI-induced rats. Moreover, silencing of CRNDE relieved mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and neuroinflammation in the NP model. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-146a-5p binds to CRNDE. Our findings validated that miR-146a-5p was a target of CRNDE and that the expression of miR-146a-5p was decreased in CCI rats. Furthermore, miR-151A-3p was found to exert a negative regulatory effect on WNT5A. In addition, knockdown of WNT5A alleviated the pain-related behavior and inflammatory response of NP in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that CRNDE contributed to the progression of CCI-induced NP via competitive binding to miR-146a-5p to upregulate WNT5A. The present study offers novel insights that may be translated into improved therapies for NP.","1270":"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most common skin cancer in humans with increasing incidence. In this paper, we focused on the effects of krueppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) on the progression of CSCC cells by binding to PFKFB3. mRNA and protein expressions of KLF9 and PFKFB3 in human HaCaT and CSCC cells were, respectively, examined by RT-qPCR analysis and Western blot. The viability, proliferation, invasion and migration of A431 cells after transfection were analyzed with MTT, clone formation, transwell and wound healing assays. The levels of glucose, lactic acid and ATP in transfected A431 cells were detected by their commercial kits. Ki-67 expression in transfected A431 cells was determined using immunofluorescence analysis and in tumor tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The levels of migration, EMT and aerobic glycolysis-related proteins were tested with Western blot. The combination of KLF9 and PFKFB3 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and ChIP. As a result, PFKFB3 expression was elevated in CSCC cells compared with HaCaT. Knockdown of PFKFB3 restrained the proliferation, metastasis, and aerobic glycolysis of CSCC cells. In addition, KLF9 could bind to PFKFB3. Downregulation of KLF9 crippled the inhibitory effect of knockdown of PFKFB3 on the proliferation, metastasis, and aerobic glycolysis of CSCC cells. In conclusion, PFKFB3 was transcriptionally regulated by KLF9, and PFKFB3 silencing inhibits the proliferation, metastasis, and aerobic glycolysis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells.","1271":"Although our previous research shows an ameliorated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in global SND1 transgenic mice, the involvement of SND1 loss-of-function in hepatic metabolism remains elusive. Herein, we aim to explore the potential impact of hepatocyte-specific SND1 deletion on insulin-resistant mice. As SND1 is reported to be linked to inflammatory response, the pathobiological feature of acute liver failure (ALF) is also investigated. Hence, we construct the conditional liver knockout (LKO) mice of SND1 for the first time. Under the condition of HFD, the absence of hepatic SND1 affects the weight of white adipose tissue, but not the gross morphology, body weight, cholesterol level, liver weight, and hepatic steatosis of mice. Furthermore, we fail to observe significant differences in either HFD-induced insulin resistance or lipopolysaccharide\/D-galactosamine-induced (LPS\/D-GaIN) ALF between LKO and wild type (WT) mice in terms of inflammation and tissue damage. Compared with negative controls, there is no differential SND1 expression in various species of sample with insulin resistance or ALF, based on several gene expression omnibus datasets, including GSE23343, GSE160646, GSE120243, GSE48794, GSE13271, GSE151268, GSE62026, GSE120652, and GSE38941. Enrichment result of SND1-binding partners or related genes indicates a sequence of issues related to RNA or lipid metabolism, but not glucose homeostasis or hepatic failure. Overall, hepatic SND1 is insufficient to alter the phenotypes of hepatic insulin resistance and acute liver failure in mice. The SND1 in various organs is likely to cooperate in regulating glucose homeostasis by affecting the expression of lipid metabolism-related RNA transcripts during stress.","1272":"Hsa_circ_0001850_circ_0001850 (circ-UBAP2) is reported to be upregulated in diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, its role in high glucose (HG)-triggered oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in DR is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential of circUBAP2 in DR. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were analyzed using the corresponding kits. Western blotting was performed to detect the protein expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and SOD-1. MTT assay was conducted to assess cell viability. A transwell migration assay was used to determine the migration ability of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMECs). A Matrigel tube formation assay was performed to analyze tube formation. The targeting relationships were verified using a luciferase reporter assay. We found that the circ-UBAP2 expression increased in DR patients and HG-treated hRMECs. Downregulation of circ-UBAP2 ameliorated HG-induced oxidative stress and dysfunction of hRMECs. Mechanistically, circ-UBAP2 sponges miR-589-5p, which is downregulated under hyperglycemic conditions. In addition, EGR1 was confirmed to be a target gene of miR-589-5p and was overexpressed in HG-treated hRMECs. In addition, EGR1 reversed the effects of miR-589-5p and induced oxidative stress and dysfunction in hRMECs. Taken together, knockdown of circ-UBAP2 relieved HG-induced oxidative stress and dysfunctions of the hRMECs through the miR-589-5p\/EGR1 axis, which may offer a promising therapeutic target for DR.","1273":"Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been attracting increasing attention in cancer diagnosis and treatment. The insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) is involved in the progression of multiple types of cancer. So, the role of IGF2BP2 and PD-L1 in hypopharyngeal carcinoma was assessed. Western blotting and immunochemistry were used to evaluate the expression of IGF2BP2 and PD-1\/PD-L1. IGF2BP2 expression was knocked down in FaDu cells, and the effects on cell viability, apoptosis and proliferation were measured. A tumor-bearing nude model of hypopharyngeal carcinoma was constructed to evaluate the effect of a PD-L1 inhibitor and IGF2BP2 knockdown on hypopharyngeal carcinoma in vivo. RNA pull-down assays were used to assess the interaction between IGF2BP2 and PD-L1. The results showed that knockdown of IGF2BP2 inhibited FaDu cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, as evidenced by the lower cell viability, a higher ratio of TUNEL-positive cells, decreased expression of Bcl-2 and cyclins, and increased expression of cleaved-caspase 3. In vivo, the tumor volume and weight were reduced by both the PD-L1 inhibitor and IGF2BP2 knockdown. Additionally, the interaction between PD-L1 and IGF2BP2 was confirmed. In conclusion, the results in the present study revealed that inhibition of IGF2BP2 might be a potentially relevant method for treating hypopharyngeal carcinoma, and the effects might be mediated via inhibition of the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis.","1274":"Spinster homolog 3 (SPNS3) belongs to the Spinster (SPNS) family which participates in sphingolipid transportation through the cell membrane. However, the functions of SPNS3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. This study obtained SPNS3 from a gene set that was related to AML relapse and evaluate whether high SPNS3 expression induced apoptosis resistance in an AML cell line, which is consistent with the role of SPNS3 as a marker of poor prognosis in the clinic. Moreover, internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) mutation and the AC127521.1\/ MIR-139\/SPNS3 competing endogenous RNA axis were found to regulate SPNS3 expression. In addition, we noted that SPNS3 may play an important role in the Sphingosine-1-phosphate signal pathway that is involved in the maintenance of the AML microenvironment. These results highlight the anti-apoptosis effect of SPNS3 in AML, and the potential mechanism mediating this effect was explored through bioinformatics.Abbreviations: AML: acute myeloid leukemia; FLT3-ITD: internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3; SPNS3: spinster homolog 3; SPNS1: spinster homolog 1; SPNS2: spinster homolog 2; GO: gene ontology; S1P: sphingosine-1-phosphate; ceRNA: competing endogenous RNA; dAML: acute myeloid leukemia at diagnosis; iAML: acute myeloid leukemia after induction chemotherapy; rAML: acute myeloid leukemia at relapse; DEGs: differentially expressed genes; BP: biological processes; CC: cellular components; MF: molecular functions; MRD: minimal residual disease; EFS: event-free survival; OS: overall survival; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; SPHK: Sphingosine kinase.","1275":null,"1276":"The aim of this study was to explore the effects and action mechanism of Zhike Pingchuan Granule in human bronchial epithelial cells induced by IL-6 or the supernatant of M2.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are reported to regulate cellular processes in human diseases, including GC. Herein, the functions of circ-HN1 and its molecular mechanisms were investigated. circ-HN1, miR-485-5p, and GSK3A levels in GC were measured using Real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Cell proliferation was analyzed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Meanwhile, the migration and invasion abilities were analyzed using the transwell assay. The targeted relationship was confirmed using a luciferase reporter assay and an RNA pull-down assay. In both GC tissues and cells, circ-HN1 expression was upregulated, and its silencing suppressed cellular processes. Moreover, circ-HN1 served as a sponge of miR-485-5p, which was reduced in patients with GC and negatively regulated by circ-HN1 in GC cells. Inhibition of miR-485-4p abolished the biological functions induced by the silencing of circ-HN1. Additionally, miR-485-5p targeted GSK3A in GC, whose expression was elevated in tumor tissues and was negatively correlated with miR-485-5p in tumor cells. GSK3A rescued the inhibition of miR-485-5p in the cellular processes.

However, the role of PTP1B in malignant melanoma (MM) is still unknown. PTP1B expression in normal and melanoma tissues was evaluated by GEO analysis and immunohistochemistry. The effects of PTP1B on cell migration and invasion were evaluated in melanoma cells with up - and downregulated PTP1B expression. In this study, we initially demonstrated that the expression of PTP1B in malignant melanoma tissue is significantly higher than its expression in benign nevus tissue and indicated poor survival of malignant melanoma patients. In vitro studies have demonstrated that inhibition of PTP1B suppresses and overexpression of PTP1B promotes migration and invasion of melanoma cells.

CKAP2, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was tested by Western blot (WB). The relationship between DARS-AS1 and CKAP2 was predicted by Bioinformatics, and the dual-luciferase reporter assay was applied to verify the targeting association between miR-3200-5p and DARS-AS1 and CKAP2. DARS-AS1 was overexpressed in HCC tissues (vs. that in non-tumor tissues) and was closely correlated with the patients' tumor stage. DARS-AS1 facilitated HCC cell proliferation and hampered apoptosis. HCC cell migration and EMT were enhanced by DARS-AS1. DARS-AS1 up-regulated CKAP2, which aggravated HCC. Further investigation illustrated that either DARS-AS1 or CKAP2 activated FAK-ERK pathway, and miR-3200-5p was competitively restrained by DARS-AS1. miR-3200-5p exerted tumor-suppressive effects in HCC and inactivated CKAP2 and FAK-ERK pathway.

Some research have found that YEATS domain-containing 2 (YEATS2) is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, whereas its function in HNSCC is left to be studied. The primary aim was to investigate the role of YEATS2 in proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration in HNSCC cells and explore the possible mechanisms. We found YEATS2 expression was elevated in HNSCC clinical samples. Our work also indicated YEATS2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and diminished the migration and invasion capability in HNSCC cell lines, including Detroit562 and FaDu cells. Besides, these inhibiting effects of YEATS2 knockdown could be crippled by microRNA-378a-5p (miR-378a-5p) inhibitor. In conclusion, our data suggested that YEATS2 expression was regulated by miR-378a-5p and YEATS2 knockdown inhibited proliferation and metastasis while induced apoptosis in HNSCC cells.","1323":null,"1324":"RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play a pivotal role in various biological processes, and aberrant expression of RBPs is closely associated with tumorigenesis and progression. However, the role of RBPs in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) is yet unveiled. In this study, RNA sequences and clinical information of OCSCC samples were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A total of 650 RBPs, with significantly different expression between healthy and OCSCC samples, were identified using the limma package. A prognostic model was constructed by Lasso-Cox analysis, resulting in the determination of 7 prognosis-related RBPs: ERMP1, RNASE3, ARL4D, CSRP2, ULK1, ZC3H12D, and RPS28. Based on the prognostic model, the risk scores of the OCSCC samples were calculated. The capability of the prognostic model was further evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The areas under ROC were 0.764, 0.771, and 0.809 at 1, 3 and 5-year respectively in the TCGA dataset. Internal and external validation showed satisfactory predictive capability for prognosis in OCSCC. In addition, a nomogram was created to graphically present the model. To further validate the analytical data, qRT-PCR was performed on normal and OCSCC cell lines. The mRNA expression of the 7 prognostic genes was in accordance with the analytical results. Functional analysis and gene connection networks were used to describe the biological functions and underlying interactions among the 7 prognostic genes Overall, 7 prognosis-related RBPs were identified, which could be used to predict clinical prognosis and to identify potential therapeutic targets for OCSCC.","1325":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are revealed to participate in the progression of multiple malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This work is intended to decipher the function of microRNA-195-3p (miR-195-3p) in regulating the radiosensitivity of NPC cells and its mechanism. MiR-195-3p and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) expressions were detected in NPC tissues and cells using qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Moreover, radiation-resistant cell lines were induced by continuous irradiation with different doses. Furthermore, the CCK-8 experiment, colony formation assay and flow cytometry were utilized to examine the growth, apoptosis and cell cycle of radioresistant cells. Bioinformatics prediction and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were applied to prove the targeting relationship between miR-195-3p and CDK1 mRNA 3'UTR. The data showed that miR-195-3p was remarkably down-modulated in NPC tissues and was associated with increased tumor grade, lymph node metastasis and clinical stage of the patients. MiR-195-3p expression was significantly down-modulated in radiation-resistant NPC tissues and NPC cell lines relative to radiation-sensitive NPC tissues and human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, while CDK1 expression was notably up-modulated. MiR-195-3p overexpression inhibited the growth of NPC cells, decreased radioresistance, promoted apoptosis, and impeded the cell cycle progression. CDK1 was a target gene of miR-195-3p, and CDK1 overexpression counteracted the effects of miR-195-3p on NPC cell growth, apoptosis, cell cycle progression and radiosensitivity. In summary, miR-195-3p improves the radiosensitivity of NPC cells by targeting and regulating CDK1.","1326":null,"1327":null,"1328":null,"1329":null,"1330":"Increase in anthropogenic activities due to rapid industrialization had caused an elevation in heavy metal contamination of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. These pollutants have detrimental effects on human and environmental health. The majority of these pollutants are carcinogenic, neurotoxic, and are very poisonous even at very low concentrations. Contamination caused by heavy metals has become a global concern for which the traditional treatment approaches lack in providing a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution. Therefore, the use of microorganisms and plants to reduce the free available heavy metal present in the environment has become the most acceptable method by researchers. Also, in microbial- and phyto-remediation the redox reaction shifts the valence which makes these metals less toxic. In addition to this, the use of biochar as a remediation tool has provided a sustainable solution that needs further investigations toward its implementation on a larger scale. Enzymes secreted by microbes and whole microbial cell are considered an eco-efficient biocatalyst for mitigation of heavy metals from contaminated sites. To the best of our knowledge there is very less literature available covering remediation of heavy metals aspect along with the sensors used for detection of heavy metals. Systematic management should be implemented to overcome the technical and practical limitations in the use of these bioremediation techniques.

We aimed to investigate whether glycolysis-related genes (GRGs) are associated with overall survival in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Here, we identified differentially expressed GRGs in TCGA dataset and microarray sample of GSE27020 from GEO database. A set of two glycolytic gene signatures, including DDIT4 and PLOD2 was screened through Cox and Lasso regression. The risk score was calculated using the gene expression of the two GRGs. The high-risk group presented a poor prognosis through Kaplan-Meier method. The ROC curve indicated good prediction performance in survival based on the validation of four cohorts. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses suggested that two-gene signature could be an independent risk factor in LSCC. A total of 17 LSCC patients were enrolled to clarify the genetic expression through using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A visualized nomogram was then constructed to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival.

We found that limonin attenuated DOX-mediated cytoxicology of myocardial cell line H9C2 by measuring cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Additionally, limonin ameliorates DOX-induced cardiac injury in rat by examining the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, and histopathological changes. Mechanistically, it was shown that limonin partially abrogated the inhibition of Nuclear factor - like 2 and Sirtuin 2 signaling induced by DOX. Furthermore, limonin-mediated protective effects on DOX-mediated cytoxicology of H9C2 were rescued by a Sirt2-specific inhibitor or siRNA against Sirt2. Thus, this work reveals that limonin can suppress DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity by activating Nrf2 and Sirt2 signaling.","1336":"Necrotizing enterocolitis, a devastating gastrointestinal disease with high mortality, poses great threats to global health. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the role of ANGPT2, as well as the potential mechanism, in necrotizing enterocolitis. IEC-6 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce necrotizing enterocolitis model in vitro. The expression of ANGPT2 was measured by RT-qPCR. The cell viability was detected using CCK-8. Besides, the expressions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins, Notch signaling pathway-related proteins and tight junction proteins were checked by western blot. The apoptosis and inflammatory response were detected by TUNEL and ELISA, respectively. Moreover, with the adoption of TEER, the cell monolayer permeability was detected. The results showed that ANGPT2 expression was greatly increased after LPS induction. In addition, ANGPT2 knockdown significantly decreased the apoptosis, inflammatory response, barrier dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress of LPS-induced IEC-6 cells. What is more, ANGPT2 knockdown could block Notch signaling pathway. Additionally, with the treatment of Jagged-1, the protective effect of ANGPT2 knockdown on LPS-induced intestinal injury was partly abolished. To sum up, silencing ANGPT2 could improve LPS-induced inflammation, barrier dysfunction and ER stress of intestinal epithelial cells via blocking Notch signaling pathway.","1337":null,"1338":null,"1339":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important regulatory roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The proliferation of cancer cells was evaluated using 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability and colony formation assays. Bioinformatics prediction, dual luciferase assay and RNA pull-down assay were performed to analyze the relationships between LOC107985656 and miR-106b-5p, or miR-106b-5p and large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1). The protein expression levels were detected using Western blot. Results showed that LncRNA LOC107985656 was downregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Upregulation of LOC107985656 inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells, whereas its knockdown promoted this phenomenon. LOC107985656 could activate the tumor-suppressive Hippo pathway by repressing yes association protein (YAP) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (WWTR1, also known as TAZ) (two homologs of Yki) protein expression in HCC. Further investigation suggested that LOC107985656 regulated the expression of LATS1 by acting as a sponge for absorbing miR-106b-5p in HCC cells. In conclusion, this study unraveled the role of LOC107985656 following a ceRNA (competing endogenous RNAs) mechanism for the miR-106b-5p\/LATS1 axis in HCC.

Then, functional effects of circ_0054537 in RCC were detected using cell counting kit-8, transwell, flow cytometry and glycolysis stress test and adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assays. The results uncovered that circ_0054537 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, autophagy and glycolysis, but promoted apoptosis in RCC cells. Notably, circ_0054537 was identified as a ceRNA for microRNA (miR)-640, and miR-640 could target neuronal pentraxin-2 (NPTX2), as evidenced by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Besides, miR-640 downregulation or NPTX2 overexpression partly overturned the tumor suppressor function of circ_0054537 silence and miR-640 overexpression in RCC cells. Additionally, RCC cell growth in vivo was retarded by circ_0054537 silence.

This study was designed to explore the underlying mechanism driving circRNA-mediated modulation of gastric cancer (GC). Bioinformatics analysis of gene chip GSE83521 was used to identify multiple circRNAs that were differentially regulated in matched GC and adjacent normal tissues. The circRNA with the largest variation in expression (hsa_circ_0000751) was selected for further examination. The expression profile of hsa_circ_0000751 and its target-specific interactions with microRNAs (miRNAs) and downstream gene transcripts were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, luciferase reporter assays, and rescue assays in human tissues and cells. The relationship between hsa_circ_0000751 expression and the clinicopathological parameters of 25 GC patients was analyzed. Furthermore, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 2 (UQCRC2), a GC suppressor, was detected via western blot analysis. The results showed that hsa_circ_0000751 levels were markedly downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines, which were also inversely proportional to the stage of tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification, tumor volume, and lymph node metastasis in GC patients. Conversely, hsa_circ_0000751 overexpression suppressed tumor progression, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. From our results, we showed that hsa_circ_0000751 may serve as a miRNA sponge to suppress the activity of miR-488, thereby increasing the expression of the miR-488-target gene, UQCRC2, and limiting GC progression.

Many studies have shown that long non-coding RNA plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of AS. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of lncRNA-small nucleolar RNA host gene 8 (SNHG8) in AS. The expressions of serum lncSNHG8 and miR-224-3p were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic meaning of lncSNHG8 in AS was estimated by Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between lncSNHG8 and various clinical indicators, as well as miR-244-3p was evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. Cell proliferation and migration were estimated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell assay. The interaction between lncSNHG8 and miR-224-3p was proved by luciferase reporter gene assay.

Recent studies have found that lens epithelial cell apoptosis caused by oxidative damage is the critical cause of cataract. Moreover, TRIM22 could alleviate the ubiquitination of TRAF6. The expression of TRAF6 could activate the p38\/MAPK pathway and aggravate the oxidative stress induced damage of lens epithelial cells. However, whether the TRIM22 could alleviate the oxidative stress induced damage of lens epithelial cells by regulating the expression of TRAF6 and p38\/MAPK pathway is unclear. In this study, we stimulated the lens epithelial cells with the H2O2 and established the TRIM22 knockdown cells. Next, proliferation of these cells was determined by CCK-8 and EdU assays. Apoptosis of these cells was detected with the TUNEL assays. Levels of ROS was explored with the DCFH-DA staining. Finally, the expression levels of TRAF6, p-p38 and p-ERK were determined with the western blotting. According to the results, we found that knockdown of TRIM22 suppressed the proliferation and relieved the H2O2 induced DNA double-strand break and apoptosis of these cells. Inhibition of TRIM22 inhibited the production of ROS in these cells. Moreover, restriction of TRIM22 induced the decreased levels of TRAF6, p-p38 and p-ERK in lens epithelial cells.

In cervical cancer tissues and cells, miR-186-3p was downregulated, and IGF1 was upregulated. In addition, miR-186-3p inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and enhanced apoptosis of cervical cancer cells. Moreover, our results showed that miR-186-3p inversely regulated the mRNA expression of IGF1 through direct contact. Knockdown of IGF1 reversed the results of miR-186-3p inhibitor in cervical cancer cells.

Moreover, CDCA7 expression in adjacent normal tissues and tumor tissues of OC patients as well as in normal ovarian epithelial cells (NOEC) and ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR3, SKOV3, CAOV-3, A2780) was further confirmed via Western blot assay and Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In addition, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also applied for determination of CDCA7 expression in tissues of OC patients. Then, SKOV3 cells were introduced with shRNA-CDCA7 for functional experiments.

LncRNA APCDD1L-AS1 has been reported to participate in tumorigenesis and development of acquired chemoresistance. However, the role of APCDD1L-AS1 in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance regulation within OSCC is still obscure. In this study, 5-FU-resistant cell models were established with OSCC cell lines (HSC-3 and HN-4). Gene expressions and protein levels were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. CCK-8, colony forming, and flow cytometry were utilized to measure IC50 value, cell viability, and cell apoptosis of 5-FU-resistant OSCC cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were applied to identify the associations between miR-1224-5p and APCDD1L-AS1 or NSD2. Herein, high APCDD1L-AS1 expression was shown in OSCC tissues and cells resistant to 5-FU and related to the worse prognosis of OSCC patients. APCDD1L-AS1 knockdown impaired 5-FU resistance in 5-FU-resistant OSCC cells by reducing IC50 value, suppressing cell viability, and accelerating cell apoptosis. Besides, extracellular APCDD1L-AS1 could be transferred to sensitive cells via exosome incorporation, thereby transmitting 5-FU resistance in OSCC cells. Besides, miR-1224-5p was a molecular target of APCDD1L-AS1 and directly targeted NSD2 in 5-FU-resistant cells. MiR-1224-5p exhibited a much lower level in 5-FU-resistant tissues and increased 5-FU sensitivity in 5-FU-resistant OSCC cells. Moreover, NSD2 upregulation neutralized the influence of blocking APCDD1L-AS1 in HSC-3\/5-FU and HN-4\/5-FU cells on 5-FU resistance. To sum up, our study demonstrated that exosomal APCDD1L-AS1 conferred resistance to 5-FU in HSC-3\/5-FU and HN-4\/5-FU cells via the miR-1224-5p\/NSD2 axis, thus providing a novel target for OSCC chemoresistance.","1355":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disease that affects the health of many women. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are associated with the occurrence and progression of PCOS. This study aimed to explore the function of circ_RANBP9 in PCOS. First, the circ_RANBP9 level was found to be increased in the plasma of patients with PCOS and ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) using Reverse Transcription-Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). In GCs, loss of circ_RANBP9 decelerated proliferation and accelerated apoptosis of KGN and COV434 cells, as determined by MTT assay, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis showed that circ_RANBP9 and XIAP can be targeted by the microRNA, miR-136-5p. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay further verified the interaction between miR-136-5p and circ_RANBP9 or XIAP. Importantly, knockdown of circ_RANBP9 suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis of KGN and COV434 cells, whereas inhibition of miR-136-5p reversed these effects. Additionally, XIAP abolished the repression of proliferation and acceleration of apoptosis induced by miR-136-5p. The promotion of apoptosis was accompanied by upregulation of caspase-3 and Bax, and downregulation of Bcl-2, as estimated by western blotting. In conclusion, silencing of circ_RANBP9 inhibited GC proliferation and facilitated apoptosis by mediating the miR-136-5p\/XIAP pathway.

Changes in ADAM9 expression after X-ray irradiation were identified using western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. ADAM9 stable knockdown and overexpression cell lines were constructed using lentivirus packaging. The radiosensitivity of HCC cells with altered ADAM9 expression was examined by CCK-8 assays, subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiments, and clone formation assays. This study also determined how autophagy affected HCC cell radiosensitivity. Furthermore, ADAM9, p62 and Bax expressions in HCC tissues that were removed after radiotherapy were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the relationship among the levels of these molecules was statistically analyzed. The level of ADAM9expression in HCC cells increased after X-ray irradiation. Through CCK-8 assays, subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiments, and clone formation assays, this work discovered the increased MHCC97H cell radiosensitivity after ADAM9 knockdown, and the radiosensitivity of Huh7 cells decreased after the overexpression of ADAM9. Furthermore, ADAM9 induced HCC cell autophagy via downregulating Nrf2 expression, while autophagy inhibition or induction reversed the effects of altered ADAM9 expression on radiosensitivity. Moreover, ADAM9 level showed a negative correlation with Bax and p62 expression within HCC tissues after radiotherapy. Taken together, ADAM9 decreased the radiosensitivity of HCC cells, and autophagy mediated this process.","1371":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in bone metabolism, which is mediated by microRNA (miRNA) sponges. However, it is not clear how circRNA regulates osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs).Therefore, based on the previous circRNA chip results, hsa_circ_0006766, which is differentially expressed in the osteogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs, was screened out, and bioinformatics analysis was performed to predict potential target miRNAs. During osteogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs, hsa_circ_0006766 and its target miRNAs (miR-4739, miR-619-5p, miR-5787, miR-7851-3p, and miR-3192-5p) were detected by quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Target gene prediction for the differentially expressed target miRNAs was performed, and target genes were validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and qRT-PCR. It is shown that hsa_circ_0006766 was up-regulated and miR-4739 was down-regulated during osteogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs.Moreover, the target gene Notch2 was predicted to be highly expressed during osteogenic differentiation. And dual-luciferase assay proved that Notch2 was the gene targeting to miR-4739. Taken together, our finding confirmed that hsa_circ_0006766 may act as a major regulatory part in osteogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs via an hsa_circ_0006766-miR-4739-Notch2 regulatory axis.

In the present study, we explored the effects of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction and inflammatory response of colonic epithelial NCM460 cells. According to the results of cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry analysis, the viability of NCM460 cells was inhibited, and the apoptosis was increased after LPS treatment, and AuNPs reversed these changes in a dose-dependent way. The permeability was evaluated by detecting the flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran and transepithelial electrical resistance. LPS enhanced the permeability and promoted barrier dysfunction of NCM460 cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent sorbent assay results revealed that the concentrations of pro-inflammatory factors and nitric oxide were elevated by LPS treatment and decreased by the AuNPs. LPS aggravated the inflammatory response, which was rescued by the AuNPs. Moreover, LPS promoted the activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase\/c-Jun NH-terminal kinase signaling pathways, which were inhibited by AuNPs.","1373":null,"1374":"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women despite the significant improvement in diagnosis and treatment. Tumor-associated neutrophils have been shown to suppress antitumor functions of the host. However, how breast cancer tumor microenvironment influences the phenotype and functions of neutrophils to potentiate T cell immunosuppression is unknown. Herein, neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors were treated with supernatants from breast cancer cell lines or recombinant human CCL20. PD-L1 expression on neutrophils was then evaluated by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Neutrophils and Jurkat T cells were cocultured to evaluate the effect of tumor-associated neutrophils on T cell functions. Finally, immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the clinical relevance of neutrophils infiltrating breast tumor tissues. Tumor-derived CCL20 activated and upregulated PD-L1 expression on neutrophils. A significant positive correlation was found between CCL20 and CD66b+ neutrophils in tumor tissues. Through in vitro experiment, tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) effectively suppressed T cell immunity which was reversed upon PD-L1 blockade.Moreover, a high density of TANs was associated with short disease free survival in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, receiver operating curve showed that the density of TANs could accurately predict disease-free survival in breast cancer patients.

It has been reported that serine\/threonine kinase 39 (STK39) participates in tumorigenesis. However, the role of STK39 in HCC remains unknown. In this study, the qRT-PCR and western blot assay demonstrated that STK39 expression was enhanced in HCC patients and tissues. Moreover, CCK-8 and colony formation assays confirmed that knockdown of STK39 suppressed SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells proliferation. Furthermore, wound healing assay and transwell assay revealed that knockdown of STK39 repressed SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells migration and invasion. Interestingly, knockdown of STK39 reduced p-p38\/p38 ratio and levels of c-Myc. Consistently, knockdown of STK39 inhibited the HCC tumor growth in vivo. In summary, knockdown of STK39 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells by inducing the lower levels of p-p38, which might provide a novel therapeutic target for HCC.","1376":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) FGD5 antisense RNA 1 (FGD5-AS1) was reported to exert critical roles in multiple cancers. The current work aimed to determine the role of FGD5-AS1 in cisplatin (DDP) resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The levels of FGD5-AS1, miR-153-3p, and twinfilin actin binding protein 1 (TWF1) were analyzed using RT-qPCR. CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell, and TUNEL assays were used to examine the IC50 value of DDP, cell viability, invasion, and apoptosis. The interaction between miR-153-3p and TWF1 or FGD5-AS1 was determined by luciferase reporter and RIP assays. In our study, we found that FGD5-AS1 level was elevated in DDP-resistant HCC tissues and cell lines. FGD5-AS1 silencing improved the sensitivity of HCC cells to DDP. Moreover, FGD5-AS1 directly bound to miR-153-3p and FGD5-AS1 addition neutralized the inhibitory impacts of miR-153-3p supplementation on DDP resistance in the HCC cells. In addition, knockdown of TWF1 inhibited DDP resistance of HCC cells, which was reversed by miR-153-3p deletion. Lastly, FGD5-AS1 interference decreased TWF1 expression level, which was rescued by miR-153-3p inhibition. Our study exhibited that FGD5-AS1 promoted DDP resistance through modulating the miR-153-3p\/TWF1 axis in HCC cells.

However, little is known about its underlying molecular mechanism. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of SEW and FIR interventions were obtained from a proteomics database. A total of 89 DEPs were identified. Enrichment analysis of DEPs was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. These DEPs were associated with the responses to LPSs, acute inflammation, extracellular exosomes, glucocorticoids, and electrical stimuli. The protein-protein interaction network was set up using the STRING database. Modular analysis was performed using MCODE in the Cytoscape software. Proteins Haptoglobin, Apolipoprotein B, Transthyretin, and Fatty acid binding protein 1 were among the core networks. A tail vein injection of LPS was used to establish the rat model with ARDS. Parallel reaction monitoring confirmed Hp protein expression. Inflammatory pathway factors were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This indicates that SEW and FIR can be considered as potential clinical treatment methods for ARDS treatment and that their functional mechanisms are related to the ability of alleviating lung inflammation through Hp protein adjustment.","1378":"Bacterial cellulose (BC) is higher in demand due to its excellent properties which is attributed to its purity and nano size. Komagataeibacter xylinum is a model organism where BC production has been studied in detail because of its higher cellulose production capacity. BC production mechanism shows involvement of a series of sequential reactions with enzymes for biosynthesis of cellulose. It is necessary to know the mechanism to understand the involvement of regulatory proteins which could be the probable targets for genetic modification to enhance or regulate yield of BC and to alter BC properties as well. For the industrial production of BC, controlled synthesis is desired so as to save energy, hence genetic manipulation opens up avenues for upregulating or controlling the cellulose synthesis in the bacterium by targeting genes involved in cellulose biosynthesis. In this review article genetic modification has been presented as a tool to introduce desired changes at genetic level resulting in improved yield or properties. There has been a lack of studies on genetic modification for BC production due to limited availability of information on whole genome and genetic toolkits; however, in last few years, the number of studies has been increased on this aspect as whole genome sequencing of several Komagataeibacter strains are being done.

Several studies have demonstrated the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. circUSP36 acts as a key modulator in the progression of atherosclerosis, but the molecular mechanism underlying this role is as yet unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which circUSP36 exerts its function in an in vitro cell model of endothelial cell dysfunction, which is one of pathological features of atherosclerosis. The circRNA traits of circUSP36 were confirmed, and we observed high expression of circUSP36 in endothelial cells exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). Functional assays revealed that overexpression of circUSP36 suppressed proliferation and migration of ox-LDL-treated endothelial cells. In terms of its mechanism, circUSP36 adsorbed miR-637 by acting as an miRNA sponge. Moreover, enhanced expression of miR-637 abated the impact of circUSP36 on ox-LDL-treated endothelial cell dysregulation. Subsequently, the targeting relationship between miR-637 and WNT4 was predicted using bioinformatics tools and was confirmed via luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. Notably, depletion of WNT4 rescued circUSP36-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, circUSP36 regulated WNT4 to aggravate endothelial cell injury caused by ox-LDL by competitively binding to miR-637; this finding indicates circUSP36 to be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerosis.","1381":null,"1382":null,"1383":"Human melanoma is a highly aggressive type of cancer, causing significant mortalities despite the advances in treatment.

This study aims to investigate the effects of microRNA (miR)-148 on myocardial injury in immature rats with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI\/R) injury. In this study, MI\/R model was established by ligating the coronary artery of heart. The results showed that miR-148 alleviated myocardial injury and rescued relevant parameters (mean ventricular systolic blood pressure (MAP), left ventricular systolic blood pressure (LVSP), heart rate (HR), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cTn1 and Mb in immature rats with MI\/R injury. Besides, miR-148 improved the immune dysfunction induced by MI\/R through increasing the number of interleukin (IL)-10+ cells and reducing the number of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)+ cells. In addition, miR-148 relieved the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by MI\/R through inhibiting the expression of Bax and elevating the expression of Bcl-2. Further molecular mechanism indicated that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) was the downstream target of miR-148, which was further confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay and related expression detection. Accordingly, silenced PDK4 attenuated cardiac dysfunction, immune disorder and myocardial apoptosis in immature rats and enhanced the ability of antioxidant enzymes. What is more, activated SMAD pathway induced by MI\/R injury was then blocked by silenced PDK4.

The rat hearts which were perfused and isolated as well as the cultured cardiomyocytes of neonatal rat were exposed to hypoxia\/reoxygenation (H\/R) and different concentrations of O3 followed by heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) siRNA treatment. The results showed O3 attenuated the suppression of cell viability induced by H\/R and decreased the release of activity of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in vitro. Moreover, O3 also activated the JAK2\/STAT3 signaling, upregulated the expression of HSP70 both in vitro and vivo, and decreased the index of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes caused by I\/R as well as myocardial infarct area in vivo. In addition, HSP70 siRNA and JAK2 inhibitor AG490 inhibited the cardioprotective effect of O3. And the expression of HSP70 increased by ozone was reduced by AG-490.

Aberrant PTPRB expression in CC and survival outcomes were constructed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and tissue microarray cervical squamous cell carcinoma cohort. Cultured human CC cells were assayed for viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) assays and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) assays were used to delve into PTPRB-related pathways using TCGA datasets. The levels of proteins associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and modulated by PTPRB were examined through Western blot. We found that the levels of PTPRB in CC tissues and cells were distinctly up-regulated. PTPRB was also an unfavorable prognostic factor for CC patients. Functionally, PTPRB knockdown exhibits tumor-suppressive function via reducing cell proliferation and metastasis and inducing cell apoptosis. KEGG assays and GSEA assays suggested PTPRB overexpression was associated with several tumor-related pathways. The results of Western blot assays suggested that N-cadherin was decreased in the PTPRB-knockdown CC cells, while E-cadherin was increased.

The expression of RMRP in ESCC was analyzed with the help of the polymerase chain reaction. The cell counting kit 8 assay was employed to evaluate the role of RMRP in cell proliferation, and its functions in cell migration and invasion were assessed by the Transwell assays. Meanwhile, the clinical significance of RMRP in ESCC was estimated with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis.RMRP was significantly upregulated in ESCC, which was associated with the lymph node metastasis status, the TNM stage of patients, and a poor outcome of ESCC patients. Moreover, RMRP promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ESCC cells via regulating miR-613\/NRP2.RMRP was involved in the progression of ESCC through regulating the miR-613\/NRP2 axis, which provides a potential target for the treatment of ESCC.","1407":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a type of lethal cancer in the world and its treatment options produce limited and unsatisfactory effectiveness. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) that play critical roles in tumorigenesis have shown promising clinical therapeutic potential. Here, we reported that miRNA-495 (miR-495) plays important roles in inhibiting HCC cell growth via its regulation of cell-cycle progression as well as senescence. MiR-495 showed low levels in human HCC tissues and cells. Overexpressing miR-495 in HCC cells caused strong cell growth inhibition, which results from cell-cycle arrest and senescence. CTRP3 functioned as a possible target of miR-495 in HCC cells by bioinformatics prediction and biological assay. By inhibiting the expression of CTRP3 with siRNA, HCC cells also showed similar growth inhibition as miR-495 overexpression. The re-expression of CTRP3 in HCC cells with high-level miR-495 abolished miR-495 and caused cell growth inhibition. These results strongly suggested that CTRP3 was the functional target that weakened the effects of miR-495 in HCC cells. The in vivo experiment demonstrated miR-495 overexpression had great therapeutic effects on HCC in xenograft. Above all, this research revealed that miR-495 is essential in suppressing HCC growth, and its application serves as a promising strategy for HCC treatment.","1408":"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Therefore, investigating the molecular mechanism of ccRCC is important for ccRCC treatment. Here, we aimed to explore the effect of the long non-coding RNA ARAP1-AS1\/miR-361-3p\/PGF axis on ccRCC. The expression of lncRNA ARAP1-AS1, miR-361-3p, and placental growth factor (PGF) in ccRCC cells was verified by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The influence of the ARAP1-AS1\/miR-361-3p\/PGF axis on ccRCC cells was identified using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and wound healing assay. The interaction between ARAP1-AS1, miR-361-3p, and PGF was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay. The results showed that the levels of ARAP1-AS1 and PGF increased in ccRCC cells, while miR-361-3p expression decreased. Cell functional experiments showed that cell proliferation and migration were inhibited by silencing ARAP1-AS1 or PGF, while miR-361-3p inhibitor or PGF overexpression could relieve the inhibitory effect of silencing ARAP1-AS1 on ccRCC cells. Moreover, ARAP1-AS1 sponges miR-361-3p to increase PGF expression. In conclusion, our study revealed that ARAP1-AS1 enhanced the malignancy of ccRCC cells by regulating the miR-361-3p\/PGF axis.","1409":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerge as vital modulators and tissue-specific biomarkers of multiple cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). Instead, the expression characteristics, biological function and molecular mechanism of lncRNA PCED1B antisense RNA 1 (PCED1B-AS1) in GC await more elaboration. In this study, 48 cases of GC tissues and matched non-cancerous tissues were collected, and PCED1B-AS1, microRNA-215-3p (miR-215-3p) and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) expression levels were detected by qRT-PCR. Besides, CCK-8, EdU, Transwell and Western blot assays were conducted to assess the impact of PCED1B-AS1 or miR-215-3p on cell growth, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The interaction between genes was verified by bioinformatics analysis, rna immunoprecitipation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. We demonstrated that, PCED1B-AS1 expression level was raised in GC tissues and cell lines, and increased expression of PCED1B-AS1 was in association with tumor size, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis in GC patients. Additionally, PCED1B-AS1 overexpression promoted GC cells proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT, and miR-215-3p overexpression counteracted the biological effects of PCED1B-AS1. Mechanistically, PCED1B-AS1 specifically inhibited miR-215-3p expressions, thus up-regulating CXCR1 expressions.

Recent study has revealed that CTRP6 could alleviate apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress of nerve cells, thereby relieving nervous system damage induced by cerebral ischemia reperfusion. However, whether CTRP6 could relieve sevoflurane induced central nervous system injury is unclear. We stimulated C57BL\/6 mice with sevoflurane and injected CTRP6 overexpression adenovirus vector. Next, H&amp;E staining and TUNEL assays were performed to examine the effect of CTRP6 on sevoflurane induced injury of central nervous system. Finally, we isolated primary nerve cells of hippocampus.

Results showed that sevoflurane induced injury and apoptosis of central nervous tissues. Overexpression of CTRP6 relieved apoptosis and injury of these tissues. CTRP6 inhibited the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in these tissues. Sevoflurane promoted apoptosis of primary cells and enhanced the expression of ROS and MDA in these cells. Overexpression of CTRP6 alleviated apoptosis and suppressed production of ROS and MDA in these cells. In addition, CTRP6 also enhanced the expression of p-Akt in primary cells. Taken together, our results suggested that CTRP6 relieved sevoflurane induced injury of central nervous tissues by promoting the expression of p-Akt.

This research aimed to probe into the role of miR-221-3p in COPD. Bioinformatics analysis and a series of assays including western blot, luciferase reporter, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8 and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were used to explore the functions and mechanism of miR-221-3p in COPD. First, miR-221-3p level was validated to be lowly expressed in the lung tissues of COPD patients and 16HBE cells stimulated by cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Functionally, miR-221-3p overexpression inhibited inflammatory response and apoptosis in CSE-treated 16HBE cells. Moreover, we predicted 5 potential targets of miR-221-3p and found that miR-221-3p shared binding site with cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B). CDKN1B was targeted by miR-221-3p in CSE-treated 16HBE cells. CDKN1B was negatively modulated by miR-221-3p. Finally, rescue experiments demonstrated that overexpressed CDKN1B counteracted the influences of miR-221-3p on apoptosis and inflammatory response in CSE-treated 16HBE cells.

The expression levels of circ_0089153, microRNA (miR)-198, and SUMO-specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) were gauged by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Cell proliferation, sphere formation, tube formation, and apoptosis abilities were detected by 5-Ethynyl-2'-Deoxyuridine (EdU), sphere formation, tube formation, and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The direct relationship between miR-198 and circ_0089153 or SENP1 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. The mouse xenograft assays were performed to evaluate the role of circ_0089153 in vivo. Our data showed that circ_0089153 was overexpressed in CRC tissues and cells. Depletion of circ_0089153 repressed cell proliferation, sphere formation ability, and enhanced cell apoptosis, as well as inhibited tube formation in vitro.

The aim of this study was to investigate the roles and molecular mechanism underlying the effects of circ_0074673 in GDM. Exosomal morphology was visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while exosomal size and concentration were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The expression of CD9 and CD63 was measured by western blotting. The levels of circ_0074673, miR-1200 and mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Cellular proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell, and tube formation assays, respectively. The binding relationship between circ_0074673 or MEOX2 and miR-1200 was evaluated by luciferase reporter assay, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and RNA-pull-down assay. The results showed that exosomal size and concentration were greater in the umbilical cord blood of patients with GDM than in that of the healthy controls. The expression of circ_0074673 was upregulated in exosomes from GDM and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) co-cultured with exosomes. High glucose (HG) treatment suppressed cellular proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Circ_0074673 knockdown enhanced the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HG treated HUVECs (HG-HUVECs). As circ_0074673 and MEOX2 directly bind to miR-1200, circ_0074673 silencing promoted the biological functions of HG-HUVECs by sponging miR-1200 and further targeting MEOX2. Altogether, the loss of exosomal circ_0074673 facilitated the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HG-HUVECs via the miR-1200\/MEOX2 axis, suggesting that circ_0074673 is a potential therapeutic target for GDM.","1416":null,"1417":null,"1418":null,"1419":null,"1420":"Numerous differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified; however, their roles have not been fully elucidated.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs\/miRs) are shown to be directly involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. However, the function of miR-337-5p and its potential contribution to the serine\/threonine-protein kinase, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in cardiac hypertrophy remains unknown. In the present study, miR-337-5p expression was examined in cardiomyocytes treated with angiotensin II (Ang II). An adenovirus vector system was employed to knockdown miR-337-5p expression to investigate its functions in cardiac hypertrophy. The results revealed a significant increase in the expression of miR-337-5p in cardiomyocytes treated with Ang II as compared with controls. In addition, downregulation of miR-337-5p expression inhibited cardiac hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated Ubiquilin-1 (UBQLN1) as the direct target of miR-337-5p, and revealed its function in the modulation of mTOR signaling. Rescue experiments indicated that UBQLN1 overexpression reversed the effects of miR-337-5p, and further verified this interaction.

LINC01296 is abnormally expressed in different tumors and promotes tumorigenesis and development. However, the role of LINC01296 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains not entirely clear. Thus, to explore LINC01296 expression, biological function and potential mechanism in HNSCC, we used GEPIA and GEO database. QRT-PCR was used to detect the knockout efficiency by LINC01296 inhibition with siRNA. Transwell assay was used to detect the migration and invasion capacity of tumor cells. Then enrichment and immunophenotype correlation analyses were carried out to explore the LINC01296 mechanism in HNSCC. To investigate why LINC01296 was up-regulated in HNSCC, DNA methylation analysis was performed using the DiseaseMeth database. LINC01296 expression was notably up-regulated in HNSCC, which was associated with promoter hypomethylation. Also, it was positively correlated with the HNSCC pathological stage and patients with higher LINC01296 expression levels had a poor prognosis. LINC01296 silencing inhibits HNSCC cell migration and invasion. LINC01296 also participate in the HNSCC progression mainly through protein phosphorylation and microtubule-based process regulation. Overall, LINC01296 was highly expressed in HNSCC, promoted tumor cells' migration and invasion, and might be a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker in HNSCC patients.","1423":"The present study was aimed to evaluate the expression profile of Zinc finger C3H1 domain-containing protein (ZFC3H1) using bioinformatic analysis of public datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA). The results showed that the expression levels of ZFC3H1 were notably lower than the corresponding non-cancerous tissues in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and patients in the high ZFC3H1-expression group showed poor survival. We hypothesized that the low expression of ZFC3H1 in tumor tissue might have be an inhibitory effect on the autoimmune system. We predicted the regulatory target and protein interaction partner network of ZFC3H1, and identified a PPI network composed of 26 node genes in PRAD. Furthermore, we found that the expression levels of MPHOSPH6 (encoding M-phase phosphoprotein 6) and MRPS31 (encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein S31) were lower in PRAD tissues than in non-cancerous tissues, and the survival time of patients with high MPHOSPH6 and MRPS31 expression was poor. To further demonstrate the role of ZC3H1 in PRAD, we knocked-down the ZFC3H1 expression and found that the inhibition of ZFC3H1 significantly inhibited PRAD cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, ZFC3H1 siRNA treatment could reduce cell viability and increase the number of apoptotic cells in PRAD cells.

Several studies have demonstrated the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in lung cancer. SOX21-AS1 is a newly discovered oncogenic lncRNA, but its molecular mechanism in lung cancer is not known. Here, the levels of SOX21-AS1, miR-24-3p, and PIM2 were examined in lung cancer and normal tissues. The relationships between miR-24-3p and SOX21-AS1 or PIM2 were predicted using bioinformatics tools and confirmed using a luciferase reporter assays. Colony formation, MTT, flow cytometry, and transwell assays were conducted to analyze cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion abilities, respectively. Western blotting was used to measure PIM2 expression levels in cancer tissues and cells. SOX21-AS1 expression levels were high in lung cancer tissues and cells. In contrast, the amount of miR-24-3p bound to SOX21-AS1 was relatively low in cancerous tissues and cells. The knockdown of SOX21-AS1 decreased cell proliferation, activated apoptosis, and promoted cell migration and invasion. These effects were abolished by miR-24-3p inhibition. The oncogenic function of SOX21-AS1 mediated through targeting miR-24-3p was also demonstrated in animal models. PIM2 was targeted by miR-24-3p and showed increased levels in tumor tissues and cells. Furthermore, miR-24-3p overexpression inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of lung cancer cells.

Microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and AC012668 was selected for further analysis. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured using Cell Counting Kit 8 and flow cytometry assays. RNA expression was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Triglyceride (TG) content and lipid deposition were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Oil-Red O staining. Western blotting was used to visualize protein expression. Starbase and TargetScan were used to predict the target miRNA and gene, and the predictions were verified through RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays. AC012668 expression levels were significantly suppressed in NAFLD models, whereas AC012668 overexpression inhibited lipogenesis-related gene (SCD1, SREBP1, FAS) expression and TG\/lipid accumulation in vitro. Subsequently, miR-380-5p was predicted and verified to target AC012668, and its expression was notably increased in the NAFLD cell model. Moreover, transfection of miR-380-5p antagonized the effects of AC012668 on lipid formation and accumulation. LRP2 was confirmed to be the target gene of miR-380-5p and was downregulated in the NAFLD cell model. Silencing LRP2 reversed the effects of the miR-380-5p inhibitor on lipid formation and accumulation. AC012668 inhibited NAFLD progression via the miR-380-5p\/LRP2 axis.

MiR-26a and FOXO1 expressions was examined by qRT-PCR. FOXO1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin activities were examined by Western blotting. Moreover, animal experiments were performed to verify our findings in vitro. Lastly, miR-26a and FOXO1 expression levels in clinical samples were analyzed. According to the results, Sevoflurane decreased LSCC cells' viability and even stimulated their apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, it could reduce the migration, invasion and EMT. Mechanistically, sevoflurane could downregulate miR-26a expression and that miR-26a could negatively modulate FOXO1 activity. Thus, sevoflurane could increase FOXO1 activity. In the clinical samples, miR-26a expression was significantly upregulated, but FOXO1 was remarkably down-regulated and miR-26a expression in LSCC was linked with better prognosis. In conclusion, MiR-26a is increased and FOXO1 is reduced in human LSCC, Sevoflurane inhibits proliferation and mediates apoptosis of LSCC cells. Further, MiR-26a binds FOXO1 directly, and FOXO1 expression is down-regulated by Sevoflurane. Finally, Sevoflurane triggers LSCC cells apoptosis in vivo. Sevoflurane use to target miR-26a\/FOXO1 may be a novel alternative for LSCC therapy.","1429":"In several parts of the world, the prevalence and severity of drought are predicted to increase, creating considerable pressure on global agricultural yield. Among all abiotic stresses, drought is anticipated to produce the most substantial impact on soil biota and plants, along with complex environmental impacts on other ecological systems. Being sessile, plants tend to be the least resilient to drought-induced osmotic stress, which reduces nutrient accessibility due to soil heterogeneity and limits nutrient access to the root system. Drought tolerance is a complex quantitative trait regulated by multiple genes, and it is one of the most challenging characteristics to study and classify. Fortunately, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology has paved the way as a new frontier in crop improvement, thereby revolutionizing plant breeding. The application of CRISPER systems has proven groundbreaking across numerous biological fields, particularly in biomedicine and agriculture. The present review highlights the principle and optimization of CRISPR systems and their implementation for crop improvement, particularly in terms of drought tolerance, yield, and domestication. Furthermore, we address the ways in which innovative genome editing tools can help recognize and modify novel genes coffering drought tolerance.

To date, several drugs have been used effectively for dedifferentiated thyroid cancer, whereas gene therapy may be a potential method. Literature reported that double suicide genes driven by human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (hTERTp) can specifically express in cancer cells and kill them. However, the weak activity of hTERTp limits its further research. To overcome this weakness, we constructed a novel chitosan nanocarrier containing double suicide genes driven by a 'gene switch' (a cascade of radiation enhancer E9 and a hTERTp). The vector was labeled with iodine-131 (131I). On one hand, E9 can significantly enhance the activity of hTERTp under the weak radiation of 131I, thereby increasing the expression of double suicide genes in deDTC cells. On the other hand, 131I also plays a certain killing role when it enters host cells. The proposed nanocarrier has good specificity for deDTC cells and thus deserves further study.","1432":"To investigate the potential role of GXYLT2 (glucoside xylosyltransferase 2) in gastric cancer (GC), the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset were used to evaluate GXYLT2 mRNA expression, and the standardized mean difference and diagnostic value were comprehensively assessed. Survival analysis and univariate\/multivariate cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of GXYLT2 in GC patients. The correlation between GXYLT2 and tumor immune cells was identified by using the CIBERSORT algorithm. The results showed that GXYLT2 expression level was significantly increased in GC tissues. GXYLT2 expression was significantly correlated with the grade, stage, and invasion depth of gastric cancer. Overall survival was reduced in the high GXYLT2 expression group. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that GXYLT2 was a reliable prognostic factor. GSEA showed that GXYLT2 might participate in the development of GC through tumor-related pathways. The expression of GXYLT2 was positively correlated with 5 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (resting dendritic cells, m2 macrophages, monocytes, active NK cells and resting mast cells), and was negatively correlated with 6 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (plasma cells, activated memory CD4 T cells, resting NK cells, activated dendritic cells, and activated neutrophils and mast cells).

Tubulointerstitial injury plays critical roles in the development and progression of DKD. The present study aimed to investigate the profile of tubulointerstitial immune cell infiltration and reveal the underlying mechanisms between tubular cell injury and interstitial inflammation in DKD using bioinformatics strategies. First, xCell analysis identified immune cells displaying significant changes in the DKD tubulointerstitium, including upregulated CD4+ T cells, Th2 cells, CD8+ T cells, M1 macrophages, activated dendritic cells (DCs) and conventional DCs, as well as downregulated Tregs. Second, pyroptosis was identified as the main form of cell death compared with other forms of programmed cell death. Vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1) was identified as the top ranked hub gene. The correlation analysis showed that VCAM1 was significantly positively correlated with pyroptosis and infiltrated immune cells in the tubulointerstitium. Upregulation of VCAM1 in the DKD tubulointerstitium was further verified in European Renal cDNA Bank cohort and was observed to negatively correlate with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Our in vitro study validated increased VCAM1 expression in HK-2 cells under diabetic conditions, and pyroptosis inhibition by disulfiram decreased VCAM1 expression, inflammatory cytokine release and fibrosis.

The Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that patients at stage IV and histological grade of G4 in high risk score group had a worse overall survival than that in low risk score group. The following receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curves also showed that this signature possesses a better predictive power performance. Pathway enrichment analysis discovered that 9 lncRNAs held potential roles in cell division, cell cycle, DNA damage and cytokines levels in RCC. This work indicates that the established 9-lncRNA signature has a good capacity in predicting the prognosis of RCC patients with stage IV and histological grade of G4, and may be helpful for guiding the treatment strategies for RCC patients.","1441":null,"1442":"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation participates in the progression of bladder cancer (BCa). Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase FTO influencing the BCa progression has still remained elusive. In this study, to investigate the tumor-suppressive effects of FTO via m6A RNA methylation on BCa patients, a total of 15 cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues (ANTs) were collected from BCa patients who received tumor resection in our hospital from September 2015 to December 2019. We found that the FTO expression was significantly reduced in cancer tissues compared with that in ANTs, which indicated a lower malignant potential and a higher overall survival rate. It was revealed that overexpression of FTO in two human urinary BCa cell lines (HT-1197 and HT-1376) significantly decreased the cell proliferation and invasion abilities compared with the negative controls, whereas the cell apoptosis was markedly enhanced. In addition, we noted that the changes in m6A methylation level mainly appeared at 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of MALAT1 and NOTCH1 transcripts, and at 3' UTR of CSNK2A2 and ITGA6 transcripts, responding to the overexpression of FTO. Mechanistically, we found that the splicing factor, proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ) could influence the FTO-mediated m6A RNA demethylation, eventually affecting the gene expression. This study provided a new insight into the relationship between the FTO expression and the m6A RNA methylation, assisting scholars to better understand the pathogenesis of BCa.","1443":"Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the most common malignancies among women. It has been demonstrated that long coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in CC. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the colon cancer associated transcript 2 (CCAT2) lncRNA in CC and elucidate its possible mechanisms of action. The expression of CCAT2, the miR-493-5p microRNA (miRNA), and mRNA was detected using qRT-PCR. Cell viability, proliferation, and migration and invasion were determined using the MTT, colony formation, and transwell assays, respectively. The interactions between miR-493-5p and CCAT2 or cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) were verified using the luciferase and RNA pull-down assays. The effects of CCAT2 knockdown on in vivo tumor growth were determined using tumor xenografts and immunohistochemistry assays. The expression of CCAT2 was upregulated in CC cells and tissues. However, the knockdown of CCAT2 inhibited the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CC cells in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, CCAT2 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to upregulate the expression of CREB1 by binding to miR-493-5p. The overexpression of CREB1 or downregulation of miR-493-5p antagonized the effect of CCAT2 knockdown on the proliferation and EMT of CC cells. The knockdown of CCAT2 suppressed the aggressiveness of CC via the miR-493-5p\/CREB1 axis. Therefore, CCAT2 is likely to be a promising therapeutic target for CC.","1444":"Gliomas account for the highest cases of primary brain malignancies. Whereas previous studies have demonstrated the roles of CDC28 Protein Kinase Regulatory Subunit 2 (CKS2) in various cancer types, its functions in lower grade gliomas (LGGs) remain elusive. This study aimed to profile the expression and functions of CKS2 in LGG. Multiple online databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2nd edition (GEPIA2), Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 2nd edition (TIMER2.0) as well as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used in this study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to evaluate CKS2 protein expression. Our data demonstrated upregulation of CKS2 in LGG tissues at both mRNA and protein level, especially in grade III gliomas. Similarly, there was increased expression of CKS2 in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) wildtype gliomas. In addition, increased DNA copy number and DNA hypomethylation might be associated with the upregulation of the CKS2 in LGG. Using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox regression analysis, CKS2 was shown to be independently associated with poor prognosis of LGG patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that CKS2 could effectively predict the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of LGG patients. Enrichment analyses revealed that CKS2 was mainly involved in the regulation of the cell cycle in LGG. Taken together, our study demonstrated that CKS2 might be a candidate prognostic biomarker for LGG and could predict the survival rates of LGG patients.Abbreviations: LGG: lower grade glioma; CKS2: CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 2; TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas; CGGA: the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas; GEO: Gene Expression Omnibus; GEPIA: Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis; TIMER: Tumor Immune Estimation Resource; IHC: immunohistochemistry; qRT-PCR: quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; DAB: diaminobenzidine tetrachloride; OS: overall survival; CAN: copy number alteration; IDH: Isocitrate dehydrogenase; GSEA: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; DEG: differentially expressed gene; KEGG: Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes; GO: Gene ontology; BP: biological process; CC: cellular component; MF: molecular function; NES: normalized enrichment score; NOM: nominal; FDR: false discovery rate.","1445":"Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) can serve as an important indicator to evaluate the prognosis and therapeutic response in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The identification of mutated genes that can affect the abundance of TICs and prognosis has practical implications. In the presented study, tumor microenvironment (TME) scoring was performed by the ESTIMATE scoring system on 598 RNA transcripts selected from the TCGA database to determine the proportions of immune cells and stromal cells. The infiltration difference of TICs in LUAD samples was obtained by CIBERSORT. The 'immuneeconv' R software package, which integrates six latest algorithms, including TIMER, xCell, MCP-counter, CIBERSORT, EPIC and quanTIseq were used to verify the correlation between purinergic receptor P2Y13 (P2RY13) and immune cells. Based on RNA sequencing analysis of the Lewis lung cancer-bearing model in C57BL\/6 mice and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of human LUAD tissues, the expression of P2RY13 and associated pathways were verified. It was shown that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by interactive analysis based on Immunescore and Stromalscore were significantly enriched in immune-related pathways. The expression of P2RY13 was significantly associated with prognosis and clinicopathological characteristics of LUAD patients. More importantly, this gene played an important role in maintaining the immune dominant environment and changing the regulation of TICs. P2RY13 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs) in various of tumor tissues as validated by the PanglaoDB scRNA-seq database. Therefore, P2RY13 is expected to be a potential biomarker for predicting TME and the prognosis of LUAD after verification.","1446":"Previous studies revealed that miR-301b-3p was essential to the onset and development of several cancers, but the implied functions of miR-301b-3p in colorectal cancer (CRC) remained largely unclear. The current study is aimed to exploring the potential roles and possible mechanism of miR-301b-3p in CRC. The abundance of miR-301b-3p and HOXB1 in CRC clinical specimens and cell lines was verified using RT-qPCR. The CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing and transwell assays were adopted to evaluate cell proliferation and migration. The interactivity of miR-301b-3p and homeobox B1 (HOXB1) was identified using bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter. The results of RT-qPCR indicated that miR-301b-3p was significantly upregulated in CRC clinical specimens and cell lines. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-301b-3p speeds up CRC cell proliferation and migration. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter verified that HOXB1 acted as the downstream targeted mRNA. Furthermore, silencing of HOXB1 also obviously accelerated the proliferation and migration ability of CRC cells. miR-301b-3p facilitated cell proliferation and migration in CRC, which was partly reversed by overexpressing HOXB1. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that miR-301b-3p facilitated CRC cell growth and migration via targeting HOXB1. Our results identified that miR-301b-3p served as a significant oncogene in CRC, which may provide a novel biomarker for diagnosis and therapeutic objective for CRC.","1447":"Invasion is a critical pathway leading to tumor metastasis. This study constructed an invasion-related polygenic signature to predict osteosarcoma prognosis. We initially determined two molecular subtypes of osteosarcoma, Cluster1 (C1) and Cluster2 (C2).. A 3 invasive-gene signature was established by univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two subtypes, and was validated in internal and two external data sets (GSE21257 and GSE39058). Patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups by their signature, and the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients in the high-risk group was poor. Based on the time-independent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the curve (AUC) for 1-year and 2-year OS were higher than 0.75 in internal and external cohorts. This signature also showed a high accuracy and independence in predicting osteosarcoma prognosis and a higher AUC in predicting 1-year osteosarcoma survival than other four existing models. In a word, a 3 invasive gene-based signature was developed, showing a high performance in predicting osteosarcoma prognosis. This signature could facilitate clinical prognostic analysis of osteosarcoma.","1448":"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has been the major cause of tumor-associated mortality in recent years and has a poor prognosis. Pyroptosis is regulated via the activation of inflammasomes and participates in tumorigenesis. However, the effects of pyroptosis-related lncRNAs (PRlncRNAs) on LUAD have not yet been completely elucidated. Therefore, we attempted to systematically explore patterns of cell pyroptosis to establish a novel signature for predicting LUAD survival. Based on TCGA database, we set up a prognostic model by incorporating PRlncRNAs with differential expression using Cox regression and LASSO regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to compare the survival of LUAD patients. We further simplified the risk model and created a nomogram to enhance the prediction of LUAD prognosis. Altogether, 84 PRlncRNAs with differential expression were discovered. Subsequently, a new risk model was constructed based on five PRlncRNAs, GSEC, FAM83A-AS1, AL606489.1, AL034397.3 and AC010980.2. The proposed signature exhibited good performance in prognostic prediction and was related to immunocyte infiltration. The nomogram exactly forecasted the overall survival of patients and had excellent clinical utility. In the present study, the five-lncRNA prognostic risk signature and nomogram are trustworthy and effective indicators for predicting the prognosis of LUAD.","1449":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proved to be involved in many biological processes during tumorigenesis and progression, including cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. However, the potential role of miR-26b-5p in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-26b-5p was decreased in TSCC tissues in both TCGA-TSCC subset and eight paired samples from TSCC patients, while Proline Rich 11 (PRR11) was obviously increased. Transfection of miR-26b-5p mimics inhibited CALL7 cell proliferation by arresting the cells at the S\/G2 transition. Meanwhile, miR-26b-5p inhibitor had the opposite biological functions. The results of luciferase activity and RNA-pulldown assays indicated that miR-26b-5p directly targeted the PRR11 3' -untranslated region in CAL27 cells. Furthermore, the effects of miR-26b-5p on cell cycle regulation were reversed after treatment with siRNA against PRR11. In summary, our findings indicate that miR-26b-5p induce cell cycle arrest in TSCC by targeting PRR11. Hence, targeting miR-26b-5p could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of TSCC.","1450":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are closely associated with cancer progression and drug resistance, however, up until now, the involvement of miR-556-5p in regulating cisplatin-sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been studied. In the present study, we found that miR-556-5p was significantly upregulated in the cisplatin-resistant NSCLC (CR-NSCLC) patients' tissues and cells, instead of the corresponding cisplatin-sensitive NSCLC (CS-NSCLC) tissues and cells. Further experiments validated that knock-down of miR-556-5p suppressed cell viability and tumorigenesis, and induced cell apoptosis in the cisplatin-treated CR-NSCLC cells, and conversely, upregulation of miR-556-5p increased cisplatin-resistance in CS-NSCLC cells. Interestingly, miR-556-5p ablation triggered pyroptotic cell death in cisplatin-treated CR-NSCLC cells via upregulating NLRP3, and the promoting effects of miR-556-5p silence on cisplatin-sensitivity in CR-NSCLC cells were abrogated by both cell pyroptosis inhibitor NSA and NLRP3 downregulation. Taken together, this study firstly evidenced that induction of NLRP3-mediated cell pyroptosis by miR-556-5p downregulation was effective to increase cisplatin-sensitivity in NSCLC, which provided new therapy strategies to overcome chemo-resistance for NSCLC patients in clinic.","1451":"Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) is a progressive disease that leads to an increased disability rate. This study aimed to ascertain biomarkers, infiltrating immune cells, and therapeutic drugs for SONFH. The gene expression profile of the GSE123568 dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the NetworkAnalyst platform. Functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction network (PPI), and module analyses were performed using Metascape tools. An immune cell abundance identifier was used to explore immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, hub genes were identified based on maximal clique centrality (MCC) evaluation using cytoHubba application and confirmed by qRT-PCR using clinical samples. Finally, the L1000 platform was used to determine potential drugs for SONFH treatment. The SONFH mouse model was used to determine the therapeutic effects of aspirin. In total, 429 DEGs were identified in SONFH samples. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these DEGs were enriched in myeloid leukocyte activation and osteoclast differentiation processes. A set of nine immune cell types was confirmed to be markedly different between the SONFH and control samples. All 10 hub genes were significantly highly expressed in the serum of SONFH patients, as shown by qRT-PCR. Finally, the therapeutic effect of aspirin on SONFH was examined in animal experiments. Taken together, our data revealed the hub genes and infiltrating immune cells in SONFH, and we also screened potential drugs for use in SONFH treatment.","1452":null,"1453":null,"1454":null,"1455":"Breast cancer has been known as cancer with high mortality rates. It has been studied that MEX3A (Mex-3 RNA Binding Family Member A) is involved in carcinogenesis by accelerating cancer proliferation and migration. Therefore, this research aimed to study how MEX3A regulates the biological behaviors of breast cancer. Firstly, we used GEPIA and KM-plotter databases to evaluate MEX3A expression in human breast cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. Immunohistochemistry was employed to assess MEX3A protein expression in clinical specimens. MEX3A mRNA expression level was assessed through quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Western blotting was used to detect protein expression. Moreover, Cell Count Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay were used to determine the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, respectively. Our study found that MEX3A expression level was much higher in human breast cancer tissues as compared to adjacent normal tissues. Similarly, breast cancer cell lines showed higher expression of MEX3A as compared to the normal breast cells. This higher expression of MEX3A was linked with the poor survival of breast cancer. Moreover, we found that overexpression of MEX3A stimulated proliferation and migration in the breast cancer cells. However, inhibition of MEX3A significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. In addition, we determined that MEX3A could activate RhoA\/ROCK1\/LIMK1 signaling in the breast cancer cells. Overall, our study concluded that MEX3A promotes its migration and proliferation in breast cancer cells via modulating RhoA\/ROCK1\/LIMK1 signaling pathway.","1456":"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common biliary tract malignancy worldwide. Although a growing number of studies have explored the mechanism of GBC, thus far, few molecules have been discovered that can be utilized as specific biomarkers for the early diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of GBC. Recent studies have shown that exosomes not only participate in the progression of tumors, but also carry specific information that can define multiple cancer types. The present study investigated the expression profiles of coding (or messenger) ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs, including long non-coding RNAs [lncRNAs] and circular RNAs [circRNAs]) in plasma-derived exosomes from GBC patients. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis, a number of differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were identified in GBC exosomes, compared to their expressions in xantho-granulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) exosomes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) analyses were then conducted to investigate the potential functions of these DE RNAs. Furthermore, the interaction networks and competing endogenous RNA networks of these DE RNAs and their target genes were investigated, revealing a complex regulatory network among mRNAs and ncRNAs. In summary, this study demonstrates the diagnostic value of plasma-derived exosomes in GBC and provides a new perspective on the mechanism of GBC.","1457":"Bone formation is important in the development of osteoporosis (OP). X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a lncRNA, is involved in this process; however, mode of its action is not known. We compared the serum levels of XIST and miR-29b-3p among the patients with and without OP. In rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), during osteogenic differentiation, XIST expression was detected first, followed by overexpression or suppression of miR-29b-3p and NNMT. Expression of osteogenic genes, ALP (electrochemical alkaline phosphatase) and RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) were detected by RT-qPCR and western blots, and the calcium nodules in BMSCs were detected by staining. The relationships of XIST, miR-29b-3p, and NNMT were characterized by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Serum XIST was significantly upregulated in patients of OP. XIST downregulated the ALP and Runx2 levels and inhibited calcium nodules, whereas low expression of XIST reversed these events. MiR-29b-3p was inhibited by XIST sponge and lowered the levels of ALP, Runx2, and calcium nodules. NNMT was negatively regulated by miR-29b-3p, promoting the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In conclusion, XIST is highly expressed in OP, and regulates NNMT by sponging miR-29b-3p to suppress the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.","1458":"The X-ray repair cross-complementing gene (XRCC) family participates in DNA damage repair and its dysregulation is associated with the development and progression of a variety of cancers. However, XRCCs have not been systematically studied in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine databases, we compared the expression levels of XRCCs between NSCLC and normal tissues and performed survival analysis using the data from TCGA. The correlations of XRCCs with the clinical parameters were then analyzed using UCSC Xena. Genetic alterations in XRCCs in NSCLC and their effects on the prognosis of patients were presented using cBioPortal. SurvivalMeth was used to explore the differentially methylated sites associated with NSCLC and their effect on prognosis. Next, the immunological correlations of XRCCs expression level were analyzed using TIMER 2.0. Finally, GeneMANIA was used to visualize and analyze the functionally relevant genes, while Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used for functional and pathway enrichment analyses of prognostic genes. Our results revealed that XRCCs were overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses showed that XRCC4\/5\/6 were independent risk factors for LUAD. Additionally, genetic alterations, methylation, and immune cell infiltration demonstrated an association between XRCC4\/5\/6 and poor prognosis in LUAD. Finally, the KEGG-enriched and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways were shown to be associated with XRCC4\/5\/6.

This study reports changes in the gut microbiota and metabolism during quercetin therapy for OA in a rat model and provides an integrative analysis of the biomechanism. In this study, the rats were categorized into 3 different groups: the OA model, quercetin treatment, and control groups. The OA rats was conducted using a monoiodoacetate (MIA) injection protocol. The rats in the quercetin group received daily intragastric administration of quercetin from day 1 to day 28. Stool samples were collected, and DNA was extracted. We used an integrated approach that combined the sequencing of whole 16S rRNA, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) measurements and metabolomics analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the functional impact of quercetin on the gut microbiota and metabolism in a rat model of OA. The use of quercetin partially abrogated intestinal flora disorder and reversed fecal metabolite abnormalities. Compared with the control rats, the OA rats showed differences at both the class level (Clostridia, Bacteroidia, and Bacilli) and the genus level (Lactobacillus and unidentified Ruminococcaceae). Acetic acid, propionic acid and 24 metabolites were significantly altered among the three groups. However, the changes were significantly abrogated in quercetin-treated OA rats. Consequently, this study provided important evidence regarding perturbations of the gut microbiome and the function of these changes in a potential new mechanism of quercetin treatment.","1460":"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) represents the main lung cancer (LC) subtype that possesses a disappointing clinical outcome over the decades. Tumor hypoxia is closely bound up with dismal survival for malignant tumor cases. We identified hypoxia-associated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signature to be an explicit indicator for predicting prognosis. The present work acquired RNA-seq and associated clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Consensus cluster analysis characterized the hypoxia status of LUAD patients. Cox regression analysis with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method determined significantly prognosis-related lncRNAs which were used to create a prognostic model. Diverse statistical approaches like the Kaplan-Meier curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and nomogram were adopted to verify the accuracy of the risk score. The potential immune environment landscape was unearthed by the CIBERSORT algorithm. Three hypoxia-related clusters were determined and 221 differentially expressed hypoxia-related lncRNAs were screened out. We developed a new predictive model based on seven lncRNAs (LINC00941, AC022784.1, AC079949.2, LINC00707, AL161431.1, AC010980.2 and AC090001.1). Kaplan-Meier curves and ROC plots uncovered the reliable predictive power of the risk score model. In addition, the immunosuppressive landscape was presented in the high-risk group by immune cell infiltration analysis. The seven hypoxia lncRNAs survival signature in our article are robust, accurate tools for predicting overall survival in LUAD patients.","1461":"Abnormally high expression of RecQ protein-like 4 (RECQL4) has been observed in many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to explore the effects of RECQL4 on HCC progression and the possible mechanisms. RECQL4 expression in HCC tissues and its correlation with the prognosis of HCC patients were analyzed using GEPIA2 and UALCAN databases. After detecting RECQL4 levels in several human HC cell lines, RECQL4 was silenced by siRNA transfection. Cell viability, migration and invasion were tested with CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays. The levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins were evaluated by western blotting. The ENCORI database was adopted for the analysis of the correlation between RECQL4 and serine\/arginine splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) in HCC tissues. RNA immunoprecipitation and actinomycin D addition assay were employed to evaluate the combination of these two genes. SRSF1 was overexpressed to assess the biological function of HCC cells with RECQL4 silencing. Results suggested that RECQL4 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, which was related to poor prognosis of HCC patients. RECQL4 loss-of-function repressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of HCC cells. RECQL4 was positively correlated with SRSF1 in HCC tissues. Moreover, SRSF1 was confirmed as an RNA binding protein of RECQL4. Further experiments found that SRSF1 knockdown reduced the stability of RECQL4 mRNA. Rescue assays indicated that SRSF1 overexpression crippled the braking effects of RECQL4 knockdown on the progression of HCC cells. Collectively, SRSF1 can bind to RECQL4 mRNA and enhance its stability, thereby promoting the progression of HCC.","1462":null,"1463":null,"1464":"Bladder cancer is one of the most severe genitourinary cancers, causing high morbidity worldwide. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not clear, and it is urgent to find target genes for treatment. G-protein-coupled receptors are currently a target of high interest for drug design. Thus, we aimed to identify a target gene-related to G-protein-coupled receptors for therapy. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and DepMap databases to obtain the expression and clinical data of RGS19. The results showed that RGS19 was overexpressed in a wide range of tumor, especially bladder cancer. We also explored its effect on various types of cancer. High expression of RGS19 was also shown to be significantly associated with poor prognosis. Cell models were constructed for cell cycle detection. shRGS19 can halt the cell cycle at a polyploid point. RGS19 is a G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway-related gene with a significant effect on survival. We chose RGS19 as a therapeutic target gene in bladder cancer.

Currently, there is no effective treatment for metastatic retinoblastoma. We investigated potential biomarkers of retinoblastoma by utilizing three datasets from a public database. Functional enrichment analysis, including gene ontology, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes, gene set enrichment analysis and variation analysis, suggested that differentially expressed genes in retinoblastoma were enriched in accelerated cell cycle events. Protein-protein interaction analysis constructed a network consisting of six hub genes, including benzimidazoles 1 (BUB1), cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), centromere protein E (CENPE), kinesin family member 20A (KIF20A), PDZ binding kinase (PBK), and targeting protein for xklp2 (TPX2). Drug sensitivity analysis showed that nelarabine was positively correlated with five hub genes. All six genes were expressed differently in six immune subtypes and were positively correlated with stemness indices in most human cancer types. Since CENPE is the least known hub gene in retinoblastoma, we further analyzed the potential non-coding RNAs and transcription factors that regulate CENPE and built interaction networks of competing endogenous RNA and transcription factors. Immune cell infiltration, especially by plasma and B cells, was enhanced in samples with high CENPE expression. Pan-cancer analysis illustrated that CENPE was highly expressed in a wide range of human tumors. In vitro validation revealed that CENPE was significantly upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in retinoblastoma cells. In conclusion, CENPE, along with other hub genes, could serve as a potential biomarker and intervention target for retinoblastoma.","1466":null,"1467":null,"1468":null,"1469":"In most human primary cancers, the expression, or telomerase activity, of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is detectable. However, the mechanism ofTERTactivity within oncogenesis of thyroid cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified miR-195-5p as having involvement in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion in human thyroid cancer. MTT was used to measure cell proliferation, Transwell chamber was used to measure invasion. Western blotting was used to detect the expressions of TERT, PCNA, and Ki67. Target gene prediction software predicted that TERT may be the target gene of miR-195-5p. Luciferase reporting system was used to identify the targeting relationship. A significant increase of in TERT expression was observed by immunohistochemistry compared with normal tissue, however, a decrease in miR-195-5p expression using qRT-PCRand western blot compared with normal cells. Functional analysis demonstrates that miR-195-5p negatively correlated withTERTand inhibitedTERTexpression through its interaction with theTERT3'-untranslatedregion (3'-UTR). Overexpression of miR-195-5p was shown to inhibit proliferation and invasion, and promote apoptosis of CAL-62 thyroid cancer cells. miR-195-5p-mediatedeffects were rescued by the overexpression ofTERT.

GRAS transcription factor gene family play important roles in individual environment adaption, and these vital functions has been proved in several plants, however, the research of GRAS in the development of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) were limited. A comprehensive study was investigated to explore the relationship between GRAS gene family and resistance. According to the phylogenetic analysis, a total of 144 GRAS genes were identified and renamed which were classified into eight subfamilies. Chromosome distribution, tandem and segmental repeats analysis indicated that gene duplication events contributed a lot to the expansion of GRAS genes in the switchgrass genome. Sixty-six GRAS genes in switchgrass were identified as having orthologous genes with rice through gene duplication analysis. Most of these GRAS genes contained zero or one intron, and closely related genes in evolution shared similar motif composition. Interaction networks were analyzed including DELLA and ten interaction proteins that were primarily involved in gibberellin acid mediated signaling. Notably, online analysis indicated that the promoter regions of the identified PvGRAS genes contained many cis-elements including light responsive elements, suggesting that PvGRAS might involve in light signal cross-talking. This work provides key insights into resistance and bioavailability in switchgrass and would be helpful to further study the function of GRAS and GRAS-mediated signal transduction pathways.","1471":"Long noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 10 (SNHG10) has been suggested to function as tumor promoter in various human cancer types.

In addition, the interaction of SNHG10 and miR-3690 was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter assays. SNHG10 had a high expression level in CRC tissues and cell lines. Meanwhile, knockdown of SNHG10 reduced cell viability, inhibited cell proliferation and decreased cell migration and invasion. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis revealed that one potential target gene of SNHG10 was miR-3690. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-3690 directly targeted SNHG10. Importantly, SNHG10 could decrease the expression of miR-3690 in HCT116 and DXH-1 cells. More importantly, the silencing of miR-3690 reversed the effect of the SNHG10 knockdown on the cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of HCT116 and DXH-1 cells. The present results demonstrated that SNHG10 promotes colorectal cancer cells the malignant progression by targeting miR-3690.Abbreviations: CRC: Colorectal cancer; Lnc RNA: Long noncoding RNA; microRNAs: miRNAs\/miRs; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; CCK-8: Cell Counting Kit-8.","1472":"Evodiamine (EVO) is emerging as a novel anti-tumor drug, which is involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis. High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1)\/RAGE is involved in invasive behavior of OSCC cells and angiogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the potential of EVO in OSCC in vitro and in vivo. We found that RAGE silencing suppressed HSC-4 cell proliferation and invasion, and tube formation of HUVEC. EVO showed marked inhibitory effects on the malignant behaviors of HSC-4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further experiments revealed that the RAGE overexpression was able to markedly block the effects of EVO on cell proliferation and invasion, and tube formation. By analyzing the expression of High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) and RAGE in HSC-4 cells, the result showed that EVO slightly reduced HMBG1 levels and dramatically decreased RAGE levels, while RAGE overexpression did have no marked influences on HMBG1 levels. The anti-tumor effects of EVO were further confirmed in mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma xenograft models. Remarkable anti-tumor effects of EVO were also demonstrated, as presented by reduced tumor size and levels of HMBG1 and RAGE in tumor tissue of mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma xenograft models. The results demonstrated that EVO has a direct binding effect on HMGB1, but it may be involved in degrading the protein. More importantly, it can reduce the activity of RAGE pathway by affecting the binding between HMBG1 and RAGE. To conclude, EVO inhibited proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis of OSCC through affecting the downstream signal transduction system of AGE\/RAGE by targeting RAGE.","1473":"The incidence of peripheral hip diseases is increasing every year, and its treatment is always tricky due to the complexity of hip joint anatomy and a variety of surgical methods. This paper summarizes the application research and progress of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology in different peripheral hip diseases in recent years published by PubMed from January 2017 to July 2021 with the search terms including \"3D or three-dimensional, print*, and hip*. In general, the application of 3D printing technology is mainly to print bone models of patients, make surgical plans, and simulate pre-operation, customized surgical navigation templates for precise positioning or targeted resection of tissue or bone, and customized patient-specific instruments (PSI) fully conforms to the patient's anatomical morphology. It mainly reduces operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and improves joint function. Consequently, 3D printing technology can be customized according to the patient's disease condition, which provides a new option for treating complex hip diseases and has excellent application and development potential.","1474":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have critical functions in tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The role of lncRNA COL4A2-AS1 (COL4A2-AS1) lacks system investigation. The current study comprehensively analyzed the expression, biological functions, and mechanism of COL4A2-AS1 in CRC through performing real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blot, cell transfection, cell colony assay, MTT assay, flow cytometry and dual-luciferase reporter system assays. A xenograft model of CRC was constructed to further verify the function of COL4A2-AS1 in CRC progression in vivo. The data revealed an upregulated expression of COL4A2-AS1 in CRC tissues and cell lines than paired adjacent tissues and normal cell line. Silencing COL4A2-AS1 inhibited proliferation, aerobic glycolysis, and promoted apoptosis of CRC cells in vivo and in vitro. However, overexpression of COL4A2-AS1 significantly promoted CRC cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis. In CRC cells, miR-20b-5p was sponged by COL4A2-AS1 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF1A). Restoration of HIF1A expression reversed the inhibitory effects of silencing COL4A2-AS1 on aerobic glycolysis and proliferation of CRC cells. The current findings showed that COL4A2-AS1 promoted the proliferation, and aerobic glycolysis of CRC cells potentially through modulating the miR-20b-5p\/HIF1A axis.","1475":"Although osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant tumor among juvenile bone tumors, its treatment plan and clinical outcome have not improved significantly in recent decades. Tetrandrine (TET), a Chinese medicine that is usually used in the therapy of silicosis, hypertension and arthritis, has been confirmed by many studies to possess potent antitumour growth properties, but there are different limitations when describing specific mechanisms. Here, we found that TET can obviously prevent the proliferation, migration and invasion of both 143B and MG63 cells and promote their apoptosis in vitro. Our results for luciferase reporter and Western blotting assays show that TET may exert its antitumour activity by regulating multiplex signaling pathways, including the MAPK\/Erk, PTEN\/Akt, Juk and Wnt signaling pathways. Furthermore, the regulatory effect of TET on OS cells and related signaling pathways was verified again in vivo. Our findings suggest that the anticancer function of TET on human OS may be mediated by its targeting of multiple signaling pathways and that TET may be used as a single drug or in combination with other drugs during the treatment of OS.","1476":null,"1477":"Pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and lethal malignancy. Pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs) are assumed to contribute to the initiation and invasion of PDAC. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of PDAC tumor samples from patients and control pancreas tissues to reveal the transformation process of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like ductal cells into ductal cells with invasive potential and we screened out CSC-related genes (CRGs). Subsequently, we applied LASSO and Cox regression models to identify five CRGs with potential prognostic values and constructed a risk prognostic model using the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. The risk models were verified using Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Patients in the high-risk group had a significantly poor overall survival (Pvalue&lt;0.0001), as illustrated by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, and the area under the curve confirmed the accuracy of predictions by our risk model. Tumor mutation burden variations were used to further explore the differences between the two risk cohorts. In addition, the Human Protein Atlas was used to investigate the protein expression of five hub CRGs. In brief, we utilized scRNA-seq to reveal the invasive trajectory of ductal cells and identified crucial CRGs in PDAC, which may help predict patient survival and provide potential clinical therapeutic targets against CSCs.","1478":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the function and possible mechanism of miR-212-3p in fetal growth restriction (FGR) and to demonstrate the relationship between miR-212-3p and placental growth factor (PGF). First, we used qRT-PCR to detect the expression of miR-212-3p and PGF in placental tissues of normal delivery (HC group) and FGR, as well as in human trophoblast cell HTR-8\/Svneo. The results revealed that miR-212-3p expression was significantly upregulated and PGF was significantly downregulated in placental tissue in the FGR group compared with the HC group. In addition, interference with miR-212-3p expression increased the proliferation, invasion, and migration of HTR-8\/SVneo cells and decreased apoptosis of cells. Meanwhile, Western blot results showed that miR-212-3p expression downregulation promoted the phosphorylated protein expression of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT), which in turn activated the PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway. And the results of dual luciferase reporter further showed that miR-212-3p could target PGF, and the expression of both was negatively correlated in FGR group tissues. In addition, downregulation of miR-212-3p expression reversed the inhibitory effect of PGF downregulation on HTR-8\/SVneo cells. In conclusion, miR-212-3p can target and inhibit the PGF expression and regulate the PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway to regulate trophoblast cell invasion, migration, proliferation and cell apoptosis. This provides a potential biomarker for the development of FGR.","1479":"Cardiac hypertrophy can cause heart failure. However, the mechanisms underlying the progression of cardiac hypertrophy remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a critical role in cardiac hypertrophy. However, the association between circ_nuclear factor I X (circNfix) and cardiac hypertrophy remain largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the role of circNfix in cardiac hypertrophy. In order to detect the function of circNfix in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes were stimulated with angiotensin II (Ang II) to mimic the pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in a mouse model was established using transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. The mechanism via which circNfix regulated cardiac hypertrophy was investigated using RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). circNfix was downregulated in Ang II-treated cardiomyocytes. Similarly, circNfix expression was markedly downregulated in mice following TAC surgery. In addition, circNfix overexpression significantly prevented the progression of cardiac hypertrophy in TAC-treated mice. Luciferase activity and RNA pull-down assays indicated that circNfix could indirectly target activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) by binding with microRNA (miR)-145-5p in cardiomyocytes. miR-145-5p overexpression or ATF3 knockdown could reverse the effects of circNfix in Ang II-treated mouse cardiomyocytes. circNfix attenuated pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by regulating the miR-145-5p\/ATF3 axis. Therefore, circNfix may serve as a molecular target for cardiac hypertrophy treatment.","1480":"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to participate in the progression of various cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study aims to find out whether lncRNA LINC01207 regulates the progression of OSCC. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to evaluate gene expression in OSCC cells and tissues. Cell viability, proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and autophagy were detected using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, Transwell assays, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis. Luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were conducted to assess the interactions among genes. We found that LINC01207 was overexpressed in OSCC cells and tissues. LINC01207 silencing inhibited OSCC cell proliferation and migration but promoted apoptosis and autophagy, and LINC01207 overexpression had an opposite result. LINC01207 interacted with microRNA-1301-3p (miR-1301-3p) while lactate dehydrogenase isoform A (LHDA) was targeted by miR1301-3p. Effects caused by LINC01207 downregulation on OSCC cells were reversed by overexpression of LDHA. Overall, LINC01207 promotes OSCC progression via the miR-1301-3p\/LDHA axis.","1481":null,"1482":"There is growing evidence that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a vital role in many kinds of diseases, including erectile dysfunction (ED). Nevertheless, the role of circRNAs in cavernous nerve-damaging ED (CNI-ED) is unknown. Here, we aimed to discover novel circRNAs, probed their potential role in the CNI-ED, and construct a ceRNA network of circRNAs. Twelve male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups by us: bilateral cavernous nerve crush (BCNC) and control groups. Four weeks after surgery, the spongy smooth muscle tissue of the rat penis was sequenced using high-throughput full transcriptome sequencing. We analyzed the expression of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in the two groups. Twenty circRNAs with significantly different expressions were selected for RT-qPCR. CeRNA network of circRNAs was established using Cytoscape. GO and KEGG analysis was done by R package. Sequencing showed that 4,587 circRNAs, 762 miRNAs, and 21,661 mRNAs were dysregulated in the BCNC group. The top 20 differentially expressed circRNAs were further verified via RT-qPCR. The ceRNA network contained ten circRNAs, six miRNAs, and 227 mRNAs, including 23 circRNA-miRNA pairs and 227 miRNA-mRNA pairs. GO and KEGG analysis suggested that these ten circRNAs could main regulate energy metabolism processes. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed with the mRNAs in ceRNA network, and five hub genes were identified. Our study revealed a potential link between circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in CNI-ED, suggesting that circRNAs may contribute to the occurrence of ED by regulating the cellular energy metabolism in CNI-ED.","1483":"Abnormal expression of circular RNA (circRNA) is closely related to the occurrence and development of many cancers. By screening the expression of circRNA, we identified a novel circRNA termed as has_circ_0023326 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). We verified the expression of circPPFIA1 and found that it was upregulated in LSCC tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues. Functional studies were carried out to detect the effect of circPPFIA1 expression on the phenotype of LSCC cells. These results suggest that circPPFIA1 knockdown can suppress the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LSCC cells, while circPPFIA1 overexpression can promote these processes. Mechanistically, miR-340-3p was predicted to be the target miRNA sponged by circPPFIA1 as confirmed through the luciferase assay and rescue experiments. In addition, miR-340-3p was found to target ELK1 and inhibit its expression. Taken together, circPPFIA1 promotes the progression of LSCC via the miR-340-3p\/ELK1 signaling axis, which may serve as a novel prognostic or therapeutic target for LSCC.","1484":"Widespread infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has led to a global pandemic. Currently, various approaches are being taken up to develop vaccines and therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV2 infection. Consequently, the S protein has become an important target protein for developing vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV2. However, the highly infective nature of SARS-CoV2 restricts experimentation with the virus to highly secure BSL3 facilities. The availability of fusion-enabled, nonreplicating, and nonbiohazardous mimics of SARS-CoV2 virus fusion, containing the viral S or S and M protein in their native conformation on mammalian cells, can serve as a useful substitute for studying viral fusion for testing various inhibitors of viral fusion. This would avoid the use of the BSL3 facility for fusion studies required to develop therapeutics. In the present study, we have developed SARS-CoV2 virus fusion mimics (SCFMs) using mammalian cells transfected with constructs coding for S or S and M protein. The fusogenic property of the mimic(s) and their interaction with the functional human ACE2 receptors was confirmed experimentally. We have also shown that such mimics can easily be used in an inhibition assay. These mimic(s) can be easily prepared on a large scale, and such SCFMs can serve as an invaluable resource for viral fusion inhibition assays and in vitro screening of antiviral agents, which can be shared\/handled between labs\/facilities without worrying about any biohazard while working under routine laboratory conditions, avoiding the use of BSL3 laboratory.Abbreviations :SCFM: SARS-CoV2 Virus Fusion Mimic; ACE2: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; hACE2: Human Angiotensin-Converting enzyme 2; MEF: Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts; HBSS: Hanks Balanced Salt Solution; FBS: Fetal Bovine Serum.","1485":null,"1486":null,"1487":"Circular RNA is an innovative kind of endogenous non-coding RNA, which could take part in tumorigenesis. Nonetheless, the potential molecular mechanisms of circVRK1 in the progression of osteosarcoma remain unresolved. In the current study, we initially investigated circVRK1 levels in osteosarcoma clinical samples and cell lines by qRT-PCR analysis and northern blot assay. RNase R treatments, RNA stability assay and nucleoplasmic separation assay were conducted to identify the characteristics of circVRK1. We adopted CCK-8, colony formation, wound-healing, and transwell assays to assess the biological effects of circVRK1 on the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. We then constructed a xenograft model in nude mice to confirm the suppressive role of circVRK1 in vivo. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assays were utilized to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms mediated by circVRK1. We demonstrated that circVRK1 was a stable circular transcript localized in the cytoplasm of osteosarcoma cells, and the down-regulation of circVRK1 in osteosarcoma tissues was related to poor outcome of patients. Meanwhile, over-expressed circVRK1 obviously restrained the growth, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circVRK1 was assumed to be a microRNA sponge for miR-337-3p, and ZNF652 was the downstream gene of miR-337-3p. CircVRK1 overexpression or miR-337-3p knockdown accelerated ZNF652 expression, and up-regulated miR-337-3p efficiently abolished the promotion of ZNF652 induced by circVRK1. Moreover, rescue experiments have proved that circVRK1 inhibits the progression of osteosarcoma by modulating the miR-337-3p\/ZNF652 axis. Therefore, we conclude that circVRK1 promotes ZNF652 expression by sponging miR-337-3p. CircVRK1 serves as a molecule sponge for miR-337-3p and mediates the ceRNA network to promote the expression of ZNF652, thus suppresses osteosarcoma proliferation, migration and invasion.","1488":"Immune cell infiltration (ICI) plays a pivotal role in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Evidence suggests that immune-related genes play an important role in the initiation of inflammation and the recruitment of immune cells. However, the underlying mechanisms and immune-related biomarkers in DN have not been elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to explore immune-related biomarkers in DN and the underlying mechanisms using bioinformatic approaches. In this study, four DN glomerular datasets were downloaded, merged, and divided into training and test cohorts. First, we identified 55 differentially expressed immune-related genes; their biological functions were mainly enriched in leukocyte chemotaxis and neutrophil migration. The CIBERSORT algorithm was then used to evaluate the infiltrated immune cells; macrophages M1\/M2, T cells CD8, and resting mast cells were strongly associated with DN. The ICI-related gene modules as well as 25 candidate hub genes were identified to construct a protein-protein interactive network and conduct molecular complex detection using the GOSemSim algorithm. Consequently, FN1, C3, and VEGFC were identified as immune-related biomarkers in DN, and a related transcription factor-miRNA-target network was constructed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was estimated in the test cohort; FN1 and C3 had large area under the curve values (0.837 and 0.824, respectively). Clinical validation showed that FN1 and C3 were negatively related to the glomerular filtration rate in patients with DN. Six potential therapeutic small molecule compounds, such as calyculin, phenamil, and clofazimine, were discovered in the connectivity map. In conclusion, FN1 and C3 are immune-related biomarkers of DN.","1489":null,"1490":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disease caused by a mutant dystrophin protein. DMD patients undergo gradual progressive paralysis until death. Chronic glucocorticoid therapy remains one of the main treatments for DMD, despite the significant side effects. However, its mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. We used bioinformatics tools to identify pathogenic genes involved in DMD and glucocorticoid target genes. Two gene expression profiles containing data from DMD patients and healthy controls (GSE38417 and GSE109178) were downloaded for further analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DMD patients and controls were identified using GEO2R, and glucocorticoid target genes were predicted from the Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base. Surprisingly, only one gene, CXCL12 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12), was both a glucocorticoid target and a DEG. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis, Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis were performed. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed and hub genes identified using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database and Cytoscape. Enriched pathways involving the DEGs, including CXCL12, were associated with the immune response and inflammation. Levels of CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4) were increased in X-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mice (DMD models) but became significantly reduced after prednisone treatment. Metformin also reduced the expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in mdx mice.

The present study aimed to explore the effect of lncRNA FOXD3-AS1 on anti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer (BC) cells. FOXD3-AS1 was found to be highly expressed in BC cell lines. Moreover, FOXD3-AS1 was highly expressed in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) cells compared to the ER-positive (ER+) cells. FOXD3-AS1 overexpression in T47D and MCF-7 (ER+) cells enhanced the resistance of cells to tamoxifen (TMX), whereas FOX3-AS1 downregulation reduced the TMX resistance in MDA-MB-231 (ER-) cells. Similar results were reproduced in vivo that FOXD3-AS1 inhibition reduced the growth of xenograft tumors formed by MDA-MB-231 cells following TMX treatment whereas FOXD3-AS1 overexpression in T47D cells facilitated tumor growth. The bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assays indicated that FOXD3-AS1 sponged microRNA-363 (miR-363) to restore expression of trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) mRNA. Overexpression of miR-363 reduced T47D cell proliferation induced by FOXD3-AS1, whereas overexpression of TFF1 restored growth of MDA-MB-231 cells reduced after FOXD3-AS1 silencing. The phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\/protein kinase B (Akt) was increased by FOXD3-AS1 but attenuated by miR-363. Inhibition of PI3K\/Akt blocked the role of FOXD3-AS1 and reduced the TMX resistance in T47D and MCF-7 cells.

The levels of lncRNA ZFAS1, miR-421, and zinc finger protein 564 (ZNF564) were detected by RT-qPCR. MTT and TUNEL assays were utilized to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Caspase-3 activity was measured by the caspase-3 activity assay kit. The binding ability between miR-421 and ZFAS1 or ZNF564 was confirmed by Rip and dual-luciferase reporter assays. In this study, it was found that the levels of ZFAS1 and ZNF564 were gradually upregulated and miR-421 expression was downregulated with increasing concentrations of bupivacaine. Functional assays indicated that the silencing of ZFAS1 suppressed cell viability and facilitated cell apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells, while overexpression of ZFAS1 had the opposite effects. Moreover, it was identified that miR-421 was a target of ZFAS1, and ZFAS1 regulated the bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity via miR-421. In addition, we confirmed that ZNF564 was a downstream target of miR-421. The upregulation of miR-421 decreased the cell viability, and increased the cell apoptosis rate and caspase-3 activity, while the upregulation of ZND564 partially abolished these effects. Finally, it was demonstrated that ZFAS1 could upregulate the expression of ZNF564 by targeting miR-421. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ZFAS1 alleviated bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity through the miR-421\/ZNF564 axis, suggesting a new strategy for the amelioration of bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity.","1497":null,"1498":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in human diseases. However, the detailed role of lncRNAs in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFs) is inadequately understood. This study aimed to investigate the potential role of lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in hypertrophic scarring. Expression of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction; protein expression was evaluated using western blotting. Cellular function was determined using the CCK-8 assay. The interaction between microRNA (miR)-29-3p and NEAT1 or fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) was verified by luciferase and RNA pull-down assays. The results showed that NEAT1 was overexpressed in the hypertrophic dermis and in HSFs. However, knockdown of NEAT1 suppressed the proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) production of HSFs. Moreover, NEAT1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA to upregulate FRS2 by sponging miR-29-3p. Downregulation of miR-29-3p or overexpression of FRS2 antagonized the effects of NEAT1 knockdown and promoted HSF proliferation and ECM release. In conclusion, NEAT1 knockdown protected against hypertrophic scarring by modulating the miR-29-3p\/FRS2 axis, which is a viable target in scar treatment.","1499":null,"1500":null,"1501":"The gut microbiota is widely considered to be involved in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Male Wistar rats were injected with monocrotaline (MCT) (55 mg\/kg) at day 1 and injected with calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) antagonist NPS2143 (4.5 mg\/kg\/d) from days 1 to 21. Fecal samples were obtained. The gut microbiota and metabolome were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and mass spectrometry-based analysis to investigate the effect of PAH in this rat model. MCT injection had a marked effect on the composition of the gut microbiota. This finding was further confirmed by metabolomic analysis with identification of several metabolites relevant to the gut microflora. However, NPS2143 partially abrogated this intestinal flora disorder and reversed fecal metabolite abnormalities.

However, the associations between IL-6, ferroptosis and asthma have not been reported. Bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B cells were induced by different concentrations of IL-6 and cell viability was detected by MTT assay. The TBARS production rate was detected by corresponding kit. The expression of oxidative stress-related indexes was detected by ELISA. The Iron Assay Kits detected total iron levels and ferrous ion (Fe2+) levels. Labile iron pool assay was used to detect the cell unstable iron pool. The expression of ferroptosis-related proteins was detected by Western blot. To further examine the mechanism of action, ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin 1 (Fer-1), antioxidant NAC, and the iron supplement Fe were added. We found that IL-6 decreased the activity, promoted lipid peroxidation, disrupted iron homeostasis of BEAS-2B cells, and induced iron death in bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. However, pretreatment with Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and antioxidant NAC partially reversed the effect of IL-6 on lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in BEAS-2B cells, while Fe augmented the effect. Overall, IL-6 promotes ferroptosis in bronchial epithelial cells by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent lipid peroxidation and disrupting iron homeostasis.","1503":"Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is one of the most common types of malignancy and accounts for &gt;3 million deaths worldwide each year. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of notum palmitoleoyl-protein carboxylesterase (NOTUM) in in vivo and in vitro, and to identify the relationship between NOTUM and the apoptosis of COAD. Moreover, the present study aimed to investigate whether NOTUM regulated Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS)-mediated apoptosis was affected by the Wnt signaling pathway. Gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) was used to predict the potential function of NOTUM. Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR were conducted to detect the protein and mRNA expression levels of NOTUM in different tissues or cell lines. The occurrence and development of COAD was detected after NOTUM knockdown lentivirus administration. The apoptosis of COAD was also observed. SKL2001 was applied to examine whether the role of NOTUM was regulated by Wnt. GEPIA analysis demonstrated that NOTUM expression in COAD tumor tissue was higher compared with in normal tissues. Pair-wise gene correlation analysis identified a potential relationship between NOTUM and Wnt. NOTUM protein and mRNA expression levels in colon carcinoma tissues and RKO cells were increased. NOTUM knockdown lentivirus serves a role in inhibiting COAD development by reducing tumor proliferation, reducing tumor size, and increasing the level of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, NOTUM could increase apoptosis in COAD, which was regulated by FAS, and SKL2001 blocked the progress of apoptosis after NOTUM regulation by NOTUM knockdown lentivirus in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, the present results suggested that NOTUM may be able to regulate the apoptosis of COAD, and that Wnt may be the down-stream target signaling of NOTUM in apoptosis.","1504":"The global incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) continues to increase while it's clinical cure rate remains low. Intestinal mucosal ulcers have segmental distribution and variable severity. Intestinal bacteria are closely related to intestinal immunity and metabolism; however, the relationship between intestinal microbiome profile and the occurrence of UC, as well as the contribution of glucose metabolism, are not well understood. This was investigated in the present study using mucosal biopsies from patients with UC and healthy control subjects. We performed high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to estimate microbiota composition and abundance as well as their association with clinical indices such as lesion severity. The results showed that the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota were significantly lower in patients with UC than in healthy subjects; however, these were unrelated to ulcer severity. Serum glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) level was associated with reduced microbiota diversity and abundance in UC. These results indicate that colonization by specific microbiota is not the main determinant of pathologic status in UC. Additionally, therapeutic strategies that increase GLP-2 levels in intestinal mucosa may be effective in the treatment of UC.","1505":null,"1506":"Bladder cancer (BLCA), originating from the epithelium of the urinary bladder, was the second most common malignancy in the urinary system with a high metastasis rate and poor post-metastasis prognosis.

This study aims to screen key genes and potential prognostic biomarkers for BC using bioinformatics analysis. Total 58 normal tissues and 203 cancer tissues were collected from three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) gene expression profiles, and then the differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Subsequently, the Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway were analyzed to investigate the biological function of DEGs. Additionally, hub genes were screened by constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Then, we explored the prognostic value and molecular mechanism of these hub genes using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). As a result, 42 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated DEGs were screened out from GEO datasets. The DEGs were mainly related to cell cycles and cell proliferation by GO and KEGG pathway analysis. Furthermore, 12 hub genes (FN1, AURKA, CCNB1, BUB1B, PRC1, TPX2, NUSAP1, TOP2A, KIF20A, KIF2C, RRM2, ASPM) with a high degree were identified initially, among which, 11 hub genes were significantly correlated with the prognosis of BC patients based on the Kaplan-Meier-plotter. GSEA reviewed that these hub genes correlated with KEGG_CELL_CYCLE and HALLMARK_P53_PATHWAY.

Thus, the study aims to analyze how they exert functions in OSCC. LINC00958, AIM2, Gasdermin D (GSDMD) and tumor protein p53 (TP53) expression levels are analyzed by Quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) or Western blotting (WB) in OSCC cells lines. The roles of LINC00958 in cell proliferation, cell death, and GSDMD expression respectively were analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, flow cytometry and Immunofluorescence (IF) assay. In addition, expressions of pyroptosis- and autophagy-related proteins are evaluated by WB detection. The targeted binding of LINC00958 and miR-4306 or AIM2 mRNA is predicted by bioinformatics analysis and detected by biodual luciferase system. RIP and qPCR assays analyze whether LINC00958 interacts with SIRT1. We found that LINC00958 showed upregulation in OSCC cells compared to normal oral epithelial cells. LINC00958 silencing significantly suppressed OSCC cell proliferation, induced cell death and reduced autophagy. LINC00958 regulated the levels of miR-4306 which binds to the 3'UTR of AIM2, and interacts with and modulates SIRT1 protein expression. LINC00958 regulated GSDMD and AIM2 levels, as well as p53 and SIRT1 levels. SIRT1 overexpression markedly reversed aforementioned effects of LINC00958. LINC00958 not only downregulated miR-4306 levels to activate the pyroptosis pathway mediated by AIM2 and promoted cancer cell survival but also induced a decrease in SIRT protein expression to further reduce p53 levels.","1511":"The lncRNAs have been made certain to take part in the development of most cancers in multiple ways. Here, our purpose is to making observation of the biological role and function of lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1 in human breast cancer.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been verified to play critical roles in the development of stroke. Herein, we explored effects of miR-152-3p on vascular endothelial cell functions under hypoxia. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with hypoxia to mimic cell injury in vitro. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that miR-152-3p exhibited high expression in HUVECs treated with hypoxia. The inhibition of miR-152-3p reversed hypoxia-induced decrease in cell viability and the increase in angiogenesis, according to the results of cell counting kit-8 assays and tube formation assays. miR-152-3p inhibition reversed the increase in endothelial cell permeability mediated by hypoxia, as shown by endothelial cell permeability in vitro assays. In addition, the increase in protein levels of angiogenetic markers and the decrease in levels of tight junction proteins induced by hypoxia were reversed by miR-152-3p inhibition. Mechanistically, miR-152-3p directly targets 3'-untranslated region of DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6), which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. DDX6 is lowly expressed in HUVECs under hypoxic condition, and mRNA expression and protein level of DDX6 were upregulated in HUVECs due to miR-152-3p inhibition. Rescue assays showed that DDX6 knockdown reversed effects of miR-152-3p on cell viability, angiogenesis and endothelial permeability. The results demonstrated that miR-152-3p aggravates vascular endothelial cell dysfunction by targeting DDX6 under hypoxia.","1515":"Circular RNA (CircRNA) plays a potential role in bone formation.

Firstly, we established osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs displaying increased mRNA expression of osteogenic differentiation marker (RUNX2, OPN, and OCN), increased ALP activity and protein expression, and increased mineralized nodules formation, as well as morphological alteration. Then, we employed high-throughput sequencing to analyze circRNA expression and found that 3440 and 3893 circRNAs in non-induced and induced groups, respectively. We further validated the 10 differentially expressed circRNAs with the most significant difference between induced and non-induced groups. Among these ten circRNAs, five of them with more than one miRNA binding site were used to construct a ceRNA network exhibiting 81 miRNAs and 182 target mRNAs. Furthermore, among these five circRNAs, we found only circ_0005564 significantly reduced the mRNA expression of RUNX2, OPN, and OCN. The circularity of circ_0005564 was verified.

Abnormal ovarian folliculogenesis is the main factor responsible for PCOS. Iron metabolism plays a vital role in endocrine disorder. This study aimed to investigate the potentials of iron metabolism in PCOS and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Mice were injected with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to establish the PCOS model in-vivo. H &amp; E staining was performed for histological analysis; qRT-PCR and western blot were employed to determine the mRNA and protein expressions. Immunofluorescence was used for mitochondrial staining. Cellular functions were detected using CCK-8 and PI staining assays. Ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) activates the transferrin receptor (TFRC), increases the iron content, and suppresses the cell viability of the human granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN). However, TFRC knockdown suppressed ferroptosis of KGN cells. Iron uptake mediated the activation of NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) signaling, which induced the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial damage. Moreover, TFRC activated PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1) signaling and induced mitophagy; iron-uptake-induced upregulation of acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) was required for mitophagy activation and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) degradation. Additionally, FAC increased iron uptake and suppressed the folliculogenesis in-vivo. In conclusion, TFRC increased the iron content, mediated the release of ROS, activated mitophagy, and induced lipid peroxidation, which further promoted the ferroptosis of KGN cells. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of TFRC\/NOX1\/PINK1\/ACSL4 signaling on folliculogenesis can be a potential target for PCOS.[Figure: see text].","1521":null,"1522":"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the fatal tumors and is associated with a poor prognosis.

Hypoxia\/reoxygenation (H\/R) models using primary cardiomyocytes have been established. Flow cytometry and Terminal Deoxynucleotide Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed to evaluate the effects of AK006774 on cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Luciferase and RNA pull-down assays were performed to verify the interaction between miR-448 and its targets. Western blotting and quantitative PCR were performed to determine protein and gene expression, respectively. We first found that AK006774 overexpression reduced I\/R-induced infarct area and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo. Accordingly, AK006774 inhibited apoptosis and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes subjected to H\/R treatment in vitro. Mechanistically, AK006774 modulated the expression of bcl-2 by sponging miR-448. Overexpression of miR-448 antagonized the effects of AK006774 on cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Hub genes were identified from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared by stromal- and immune-related components in the TME of STAD patients using R software. Cox regression analysis was used to identify genes significantly correlated with STAD patient survival. Triptolide target genes were predicted from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Top 30 genes filtered by Cytohubba from 734 DEGs were screened as hub genes. Forty-two genes were found to be at high risk for STAD prognosis. Thirty-four targets of triptolide were predicted using the TCMSP database. Importantly, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) was identified as a potential target of triptolide associated with the TME in STAD. Analysis of survival highlighted the association between CXCR4 upregulation with STAD progression and poor prognosis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirmed that genes in the CXCR4- upregulated group had significant enrichment in immune-linked pathways. Additionally, triptolide targets were found to be significantly enriched in CXCR4-related chemokine and cancer-related p53 signaling pathways.

The ischemic stroke (IS) model was established in vivo by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in vitro by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD\/R)-treated SH-SY5Y. SNHG11 was highly expressed after OGD\/R, and Dex improved OGD\/R-induced neurological injury. Additionally, Dex reversed the effects of SNHG11 on OGD\/R-induced neurological injury. Furthermore, we found that SNHG11 upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression by targeting miR-324-3p. Through rescue assays, it was confirmed that SNHG11 regulated OGD\/R-induced neurological injury through increasing VEGFA expression. At last, Dex was also discovered to improve neurological injury through regulating SNHG11 in the rat model. In conclusion, our work demonstrated that Dex improved OGD\/R-induced neurological injury via SNHG11\/miR-324-3p\/VEGFA axis. These findings may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for IS treatment.","1554":null,"1555":null,"1556":"In this study, the expression of PTAR in cervical cancer tissues and cells was quantified by real-time PCR. Then, the roles of PTAR in HeLa cell proliferation and cell cycle were analyzed by a CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively.The effects of PTAR on cell migration and invasion were checked by Transwell and wound healing assays.The effect of PTAR on HeLa cell apoptosis was analyzed using annexin V\/FITC staining. Finally, the interaction between PTAR and miR-101 in uterine cancer was verified through a dual-luciferase reporter assay and correlation analysis. The results showed that PTAR expression was aberrantly ascended in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines (Caski, SW756, SiHa, C33A and HeLa cells). Overexpressed PTAR could promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HeLa cells, which were suppressed by PTAR knockdown. Moreover, cell cycle progression stalled at the G1-G0 phase could be released with PTAR overexpression. The transfection of a PTAR vector inhibited apoptosis, while si-PTAR transfection increased apoptosis. Furthermore, PTAR could act as an endogenous sponge by directly binding to miR-101 and downregulating miR-101 expression. In conclusion, lncRNAPTAR plays a vital role and may be an effective target for the diagnosis and therapy of cervical cancer.","1557":null,"1558":null,"1559":null,"1560":"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a highly prevalent skin malignancy, and the effective therapy still remains a challenge. Crocin can be used for cSCC therapy. This study explored the effects of cSCC cells treatment with crocin in vitro and in vivo. The study used A431 and SCL-1 cells lines, cSCC human samples and BALB\/C nude mice for investigations. Apoptosis was determined by MTT assays, while miR-320a and ATG2B expressions were validated through RT-qPCR. Interaction of miR-320a with ATG2B was examined via dual luciferase reporter assay. The autophagy and apoptosis proteins expressions were further confirmed through western blot and immunofluorescence staining assays. The results indicated a significantly upregulated miR-320a, but a down-regulated ATG2B expression in the cSCC clinical samples. Crocin significantly repressed cSCC cells growth, and induced apoptosis through autophagy. Furthermore, miR-320a expression was inhibited and ATG2B expression was increased. Dual luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-320a regulated ATG2B expression directly. Additionally, the upregulation of ATG2B expression in cSCC cells inhibited cell proliferation and led to cell apoptosis. Crocin also reduced tumor growth and stimulated the apoptosis in vivo. In conclusion, miR-320a is upregulated and ATG2B is down-regulated in cSCC, Crocin suppresses the proliferation and induces apoptosis of cSCC cells. Further, Crocin increases autophagy while miR-320a hinders autophagy and the apoptotic effects of crocin on cSCC cells. MiR-320a binds ATG2B directly, and ATG2B expression is upregulated by crocin. Finally, Crocin triggers cSCC cells apoptosis in vivo. Crocin can target ATG2B\/miR-320a and may be an effective alternative for cSCC treatment.","1561":"Environmentally, bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known pollutant caused human health risk, including osteosarcoma (OS). OS, a deadly bone neoplasia, may occur in children and adults. However, the anti-OS pharmacotherapy prescribes limitedly in clinical practice.

In results, the bioinformatics data disclosed all mapped, core targets, biological functions, molecular pathways of calycosin to treat BPA-related OS. The computational analysis using molecular docking indicated that potential binding ability of core targets in calycosin to treat BPA-related OS was identified. Moreover, detailed biological functions and optimal pathways of calycosin-anti-BPA-related OS were revealed, as shown in integrated network maps. Taken together, these network pharmacology and structural biology findings illustrate the core biotargets, pharmacological functions and pathways of calycosin-anti-BPA-related OS.

We aimed to identify the common features between patients with varying degree of thoracic SCI and healthy individuals and subpopulations of microbiota correlated with the serum biomarkers. Twenty-one patients with complete thoracic SCI (CTSCI), 24 with incomplete thoracic SCI (ITSCI), and 24 healthy individuals (HC) were enrolled in this study. Fresh stool samples and clinical data were collected from all participants, and their bowel functions with SCI were assessed. Microbial diversity and composition were analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The features of gut microbiota correlated with the serum biomarkers and their functions were investigated. The mean NBD score of patients with CTSCI was higher than that of patients with ITSCI. Diversity of the gut microbiota in SCI group was reduced, and with an increase in the degree of damage, alpha diversity had decreased gradually. The composition of gut microbiota in patients with SCI was distinct from that in healthy individuals, and CTSCI group exhibited further deviation than ITSCI group compared to healthy individuals. Four serum biomarkers were found to be correlated with most differential genera. Patients with thoracic SCI present gut dysbiosis, which is more pronounced in patients with CTSCI than in those with ITSCI. Therefore, the gut microbiota profile may serve as the signatures for bowel and motor functions in patients with thoracic SCI.","1563":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play essential roles in the progression of human tumors, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The present study aimed to explore the functions and potential mechanisms of human circular RNA hsa_circRNA_101705 (circTXNDC11) in RCC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to measure circTXNDC11 expression in RCC tissues and cell lines. RNase R and actinomycin D assays were conducted to analyze the characteristic of circTXNDC11. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, and transwell invasion assay were performed to assess cell proliferation and invasion abilities. Western blotting was applied to assess the levels of MEK and ERK proteins in RCC cells. Murine xenograft model assay was conducted to deduce the role of circTXNDC11 in vivo. The current data showed that circTXNDC11 was overexpressed in RCC tissues and cells. The overexpression of circTXNDC11 is linked to advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis of renal cancer. Knocking down circTXNDC11 suppressed cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, circTXNDC11 promoted RCC growth and invasion by activating the MAPK\/ERK pathway.

AGEs are the end products of glycation reactions and play an important role in the development of OA. Etomidate is a general anesthesia-inducing agent recently reported to exert significant anti-inflammatory effects. The present study aims to explore the protective effect of Etomidate against advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)-induced reduction of extracellular matrix gene expression in chondrocytes. In the present study, we found that AGEs significantly reduced the expression of Collagen II (COL2A1) and Aggrecan (ACAN) at the gene level. Furthermore, AGEs inhibited the expression of SRY-related high mobility group-box gene 9 (SOX-9), promoting the expression of COL2A1 and ACAN. COL2A1, ACAN, and SOX-9 in chondrocytes were significantly elevated by treatment with Etomidate alone. Consistently, Etomidate ameliorated AGEs-induced downregulation of COL2A1, ACAN, and SOX-9 in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, we found that knockdown of SOX-9 eliminated the beneficial effects of Etomidate against AGEs-induced decrease in COL2A1 and ACAN genes. Based on these findings, we demonstrated that Etomidate could ameliorate AGEs-induced reduction of extracellular matrix gene expression in chondrocytes by upregulating SOX-9.","1566":"Interindividual differences in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 activity may result in variations in the therapeutic response to drugs metabolized by this enzyme. Differences at gene level may translate into protein level with consequent impairment of the enzyme activity. As a result patients with such genetic differences might experience undesirable effects or no effect at all. The aim of the present study was to find out the prevalence of allelic and genotype frequencies of low activity variants of CYP2C19 genes in healthy individuals from six distinct ethnicities of Pakistan. Blood sample was taken from healthy volunteers following informed consent. Isolation of the DNA was followed by the PCR amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Selected samples were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The frequency of major alleles was 84.93% for CYP2C19*2 and 91.85% for CYP2C19*3, while minor allele was present at 15.06% for CYP2C19*2 and 8.14% for CYP2C19*3. For CYP2C19*2, the frequency of *1*1 genotype was 75.80%, *1*2 was 18.27%, and *2*2 was 5.92% whereas for CYP2C19*3, The frequency of *1*1 genotype was 84.19%, *1*3 was 15.30%, and *3*3 was 0.49% in the Pakistani population. A substantial variation in genotype and allelic frequencies was observed in various ethnicities. Our study demonstrates that a significant Pakistani population has at least one minor allele, which indicates a large number of patients potentially being affected by these variations. Especially, a significant genotype frequency of PM suggests implication for the treatment response and severity\/frequency of adverse effects in patients receiving drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.","1567":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of novel non-coding RNAs that are vital in modulating gene expression and biological processes. Nevertheless, in cervical cancer (CC), the role of circRNA is much less investigated. In this work, circ_0000228 expression in CC is measured and circ_0000228's function and related mechanism are investigated. Quantitative real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to examine the expression levels of circ_0000228, microRNA-195-5p (miR-195-5p) and lysyl oxidase-like protein 2 (LOXL2). Western blotting was employed to examine LOXL2 protein expression in CC cell lines. CC cell lines with circ_0000228 knockdown were constructed, and the CCK-8 experiment and Transwell experiment were executed to investigate the effect of circ_0000228 on the malignant characteristics of CC cells. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment was applied to validate the targeting relationship between circ_0000228 and miR-195-5p, miR-195-5p and LOXL2. In this study, we demonstrated that circ_0000228 showed a remarkable up-modulation in CC tissues and cell lines. Circ_0000228 knockdown repressed the growth and metastatic potential of CC cells. Mechanistically, circ_0000228 facilitated CC progression through sponging miR-195-5p and up-modulating LOXL2 expression. We conclude that circ_0000228 is an oncogenic circRNA, which participates in promoting CC progression via regulating the miR-195-5p\/LOXL2 axis.","1568":null,"1569":null,"1570":"To study the regulation of miR-148a-3p on CDK6 and its mechanism in the progress of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), differential miRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatics, and the miR-148a-3p levels in AML cell lines were detected. Results showed that miR-148a-3p played a crucial role in AML, and the level was lower in AML cells, especially in J111 and KG-1a cells. In J111 and KG-1a cells, the up-regulation of miR-148a-3p mimics blocked the cell growth by arresting cell cycle at G2\/M and enhancing cell apoptosis. Transwell and EMT markers detection indicated that miR-148a-3p reduced the cell migration and invasion. Afterward, through bioinformatics analysis, it showed that the CDK6 is one of the direct target genes of miR-148a-3p. DLR assay confirmed the target regulation. CDK6 overexpression reversed the effects of miR-148a-3p on AML cells.

However, its immune effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been reported. This study aimed to identify the immune role of FAM83D in HCC. FAM83D was over-expressed in HCC and contributed to poor prognosis according to the results of data analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Afterward, the levels of immune cells infiltration were found to be correlated with the expression level of FAM83D in HCC. Through TISIDB and cBioPortal network tools, a total of 82 FAM83D-associated genes were screened out, including 12 immunoinhibitors, 20 immunostimulators and 50 tightly co-expressed genes. TCGA cohort was divided into train set and test set on the basis of the proportion of 7:3. According to FAM83D-associated immunomodulators, a four gene predicted model was established using train set via the Cox regression analysis. Survival analysis demonstrated that the overall survival (OS) of high-risk HCC patients was poor compared with the patients in low-risk group. The reliability and predicted power of the risk-score model were identified by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A risk-score based nomogram as well as a calibration curve, which were created could be used to anticipate patient's 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival probabilities. The test set was used to validate these results. Our findings showed that the FAM83D gene was related with HCC immunity. The immune marker chosen could be a promising biomarker for HCC prognosis.","1572":"LncRNAs belong to the type of noncoding RNA transcripts, which exceed 200 nucleotides in size. MALAT1 as one of the earlier identified lncRNAs in cancer is investigated by more and more scientific researchers. Expression, clinical significance and function of MALAT1 in pan-cancer exist as big difference. To detect the expression and clinical significance of MALAT1 gene precisely and comprehensively among different kinds of cancers, some classical databases such as GEPIA, TIMER, KM Plotter, and PrognoScan were fully applied. An immunological role of MALAT1 among different kinds of cancers was also determined in TIMER database. Our results showed that MALAT1 was differently expressed in different kinds of cancers using GEPIA, Oncomine, and TIMER databases to analyze. Especially, MALAT1 high RNA level was related to the early stage in lung and gastric cancer patients. MALAT1 expression was closely related to prognosis among different cancer patients. Furthermore, expression of MALAT1 was related to tumor immune cell infiltrating. Expression level of MALAT1 was also related to immune makers such as macrophage, T cell, NK cells, and so on.

The present study was designed to observe the effect of dendrobine in a model of ERS using vascular endothelial cells and to reveal the biological mechanisms and pathways responsible for the therapeutic effects of dendrobine on AS. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pre-treated with various concentrations of dendrobine, followed by treatment with tunicamycin (TM) for the establishment of the cell models of ERS. The proliferation and apoptosis of HUVECs were detected by bromodeoxyuridine staining and flow cytometry, respectively. The target binding association was verified through dual luciferase reporter assay. It was found that TM treatment resulted in a low expression of miR-381-3p. Dendrobine treatment not only promoted the proliferation, but also inhibited the apoptosis of HUVECs induced by TM. The reduced expression of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, inositol-requiring enzyme 1, caspase-4, C\/EBP homologous protein and caspase-3 was also observed following treatment with dendrobine. Dendrobine reduced the apoptosis of endothelial cells in the model of ERS by increasing miR-381-3p expression, and partially restored the cell proliferation level. This effect was significantly reduced after the expression of miR-381-3p was blocked. On the whole, the present study demonstrated that dendrobine upregulated miR-381-3p expression to inhibit apoptosis induced by ERS in HUVECs and this process was found to be mediated by caspase-4. The findings of the present study may provide new insight into the causes of endothelial cell apoptosis during AS and reveal the potent therapeutic effects of dendrobine in AS.","1576":"Hepatoblastoma is a kind of extreme malignancy frequently diagnosed in children. Although surgical resection is considered as the first-line treatment for hepatoblastoma, a relatively large population of patients have lost the preferred opportunity for surgery. Administration of locoregional ablation enables local tumor control but with the deficiency of insufficient ablation, residual tumor, and rapid progression. In this study, we integrated 219 hepatoblastoma and 121 non-cancer liver tissues to evaluate the expression of NR2F6, from which a higher NR2F6 level was found in hepatoblastoma compared with non-cancer livers with a standard mean difference (SMD) of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.29). The overexpression of NR2F6 also appeared to be an efficient indicator in distinguishing hepatoblastoma tissues from non-cancer liver tissues from the indication of a summarized AUC of 0.90, with a pooled sensitivity of 0.76 and a pooled specificity of 0.89. Interestingly, nude mouse xenografts provided direct evidence that overexpressed NR2F6 was also detected in residual tumor compared to untreated hepatoblastoma. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-binding data in HepG2 cells and transcriptome analysis of HepG2 xenografts were combined to identify target genes regulated by NR2F6. We finally selected 150 novel target genes of NR2F6 in residual tumor of incomplete ablation, and these genes appeared to be associated with the biological regulation of lipid metabolism-related pathway. Accordingly, targeting NR2F6 holds a therapeutic promise in treating residual recurrent hepatoblastoma after incomplete ablation.","1577":"Spontaneous senile osteoporosis severely threatens the health of the senior population which has emerged as a severe issue for society. A SAMP6 mouse model was utilized to estimate the impact of intragastrically administered Astragalus Membranaceus (AR) on spontaneous senile osteoporosis.

However, the role of APPL1 in myocardial ischemia remains unclear. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the specific mechanism underlying the role of APPL1 in myocardial ischemia.In our study, the mRNA level of APPL1 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The expressions of APPL1, Apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1), cleaved caspase9 and other inflammation- and apoptosis-related proteins were determined by western blotting. The secretion of inflammatory cytokines and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were measured by commercial assay kits. The H9C2 cell viability was analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The apoptosis rate of H9C2 cells was analyzed by TUNEL assay. The interaction between APPL1 and APAF-1\/caspase9 was determined by Immunoprecipitation (IP).Our findings demonstrated that APPL1 was low expressed in myocardial ischemia tissues and cells. APPL1 knockdown suppressed the viability of myocardial ischemia cells and aggravated hypoxia\/reperfusion-induced LDH hypersecretion, inflammation and apoptosis. In addition, the overexpression of APPL1 induced inactivation of APAF-1\/Caspase9 signaling pathway.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to determine mRNA expression. Cell viability was analyzed using Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8). PI staining Flow cytometry and TdT-mediated biotinylated nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed to determine ferroptosis in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). Targeting relationships were predicted using Starbase and TargetScan and verified by RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter gene assays. Western blotting was performed to assess protein expression. LncRNA H19 is highly expressed in ICH model cells. Over-expression of H19 suppressed cell viability and promoted ferroptosis of BMVECs. miR-106b-5p is predicted to be a target of H19. The expression of miR-106b-5p was lower in oxygen and glucose deprivation hemin-treated (OGD\/H-treated) cells. Over-expression of miR-106b-5p reversed the effects of H19 on cell viability and ferroptosis in BMVECs. Furthermore, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) was verified to be a target gene of miR-106b-5p and was highly expressed in OGD\/H-treated cells.

The qRT-PCR was used to investigate the expression level of miR-488 in 125 AS patients and 60 healthy controls. The diagnostic value of miR-488 was analyzed by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. CCK-8 and Transwell assays were used to detect the ability of miR-488 on the proliferation and migration ability of VSMCs cells. Serum expression of miR-488 in AS patients was higher than that in healthy controls.

This study is to explore the influence of miR-506-3p on the malignant behavior of CRC and its underlying molecular mechanism. Our results show that miR-506-3p was lowly expressed and enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) was highly expressed in CRC. Overexpressing miR-506-3p or silencing EZH2 inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and promoted apoptosis. Inhibiting miR-506-3p promoted CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion but inhibited apoptosis. These impacts were reversed after co-transfecting si-EZH2. Further mechanism studies have shown that miR-506-3p can reduce EZH2 expression in CRC cells by binding to the 3'UTR end of EZH2. In summary, the results of this study show that miR-506-3p inhibited CRC progression through targeting EZH2 expression. This provides a new molecular target for the clinical treatment of CRC in the future.","1587":"Increasing evidence has confirmed the vital roles of circular RNAs (CircRNAs) in the drug resistance of breast cancer (BC).

In this study, mRNA and protein levels of genes were measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed the relationship between microRNA-525-5p (miR-525-5p) and circFAT1 or spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 1 (SKA1). CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry experiments were utilized to investigate the chemosensitivity, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of BC cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was applied to discover possible pathways related to SKA1. It was uncovered that circFAT1 was overexpressed in OX-resistant BC tissues and cells. Functional experiments showed that circFAT1 depletion reduced the level of chemoresistance-related genes. Moreover, circFAT1 knockdown remarkably facilitated apoptosis and decreased OX (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) IC50 value, migration, and invasion in OX-resistant BC cells. It was identified that miR-525-5p directly targeted circFAT1 and SKA1. Besides, rescue assays exhibited that circFAT1 promoted OX resistance in BC cells via the miR-525-5p\/SKA1 regulatory network.

However, little is known about the alterations of SFs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study comprehensively delineated the genomic and epigenomic characteristics of 404 SFs in HCC based on the multi-omics data from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. The analysis revealed several clinically relevant SFs that could be effective biomarkers for monitoring the onset and prognosis of HCC (such as, HSPB1, DDX39A, and NELFE, which were the three most significant clinically relevant SFs). Functional enrichment analysis of these indicators showed the enrichment of pathways related to splicing and mRNA processes. Furthermore, the study found that SF copy number variation is common in HCC and could be a typical characteristic of hepato-carcinogenesis; the complex expression regulation of SFs was significantly affected by copy number variant and methylation. Several SFs with significant mutation patterns were identified (such as, RNF213, SF3B1, SPEN, NOVA1, and EEF1A1), and the potential regulatory network of SFs was constructed to identify their potential mechanisms for regulating clinically relevant alternative splicing events. Therefore, this study established a foundation to uncover the broad molecular spectrum of SFs for future functional and therapeutic studies of HCC.","1590":null,"1591":"Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most common malignancies with high incidence and mortality and the eighth most common cancer-associated mortality in women worldwide. Aberrant expression of the GINS complex subunit 2 (GINS2) gene and miR-502-5p has been associated with cancer progression. This study aims to investigate the specific molecular mechanism of the miR-502-5p-GINS2 axis in OC. GINS2 and miR-502-5p expression in OC tissues and cell lines was measured using RT-qPCR. Next, we investigated the interaction between miR-502-5p and GINS2 using a luciferase assay. The role of the miR-502-5p-GINS2 axis was detected by assessing cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis levels, such as caspase-3 activity and caspase-3 protein expression, in the OC cell lines CaOV3 and SKOV3, respectively. MiR-502-5p expression was decreased, and GINS2 expression was dramatically elevated in OC tissues and cells. Upregulation of miR-502-5p expression repressed cellular proliferation and migration levels but increased the cellular apoptosis level. GINS2 overexpression enhanced the proliferation and migration levels but hampered OC cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-502-5p inhibited GINS2 expression and suppressed OC tumorigenesis. miR-502-5p targeting GINS2 suppressed OC progression by inhibiting cell growth and promoting cell apoptosis.

Here, we aimed to explore the function of lncRNA PAX6 upstream antisense RNA (PAUPAR) in the development of CRC. In the present study, PAUPAR and microRNA (miR)-17-5p expression levels in CRC tissues and cells were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Western blot analysis was adopted to examine ZNF750 expression at the protein level in CRC cells. CRC cell proliferation was examined by colony formation experiment and 5-Bromo-2-deoxyUridine (BrdU) experiment. CRC cell migration and invasion were assessed by Transwell experiments. Apoptosis was measured using the TUNEL experiment. The targeting relationship between PAUPAR and miR-17-5p was confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter gene and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments. We demonstrated that PAUPAR was markedly down-modulated in CRC, and its low expression was significantly related to increased T stage and local lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of PAUPAR enhanced CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and restrained apoptosis relative to controls, whereas PAUPAR overexpression caused the opposite effects. Moreover, rescue experiments showed that miR-17-5p inhibitor could reverse the role of PAUPAR knockdown on the malignant phenotypes of CRC cells. Additionally, PAUPAR could positively regulate the expression of ZNF750 via repressing miR-17-5p.

Increasing evidence suggests that various non-coding RNAs, such as circRNAs, are implicated in a myriad of biological processes supporting tumor progression. Recent studies have revealed that several circRNAs are dysregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, their functional role in OSCC and the underlying mechanism remains to be further investigated. In this study, we aim to evaluate the biological role and survey the molecular mechanism of circBCL11B in regulating the progression of OSCC. We demonstrated that circBCL11B was significantly upregulated in OSCC tissues and cell lines, and the expression level was correlated with the malignancy. Silencing cirCBCL11B inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and also included cell apoptosis in OSCC cells. miR-145 was identified as a downstream target mediating the effect of circBCL11B by targeting LASP1. miR-145 negatively regulated LASP1 expression, which could be rescued by miR-145 inhibitor.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with occurrence and progression of PE. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the function of the lncRNA prospero homeobox 1-antisense RNA 1 (PROX1-AS1) and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism of action. We found that the expression levels of PROX1-AS1 were elevated in both the placental tissues and blood samples of the patients with PE. Moreover, the results of the flow cytometry and transwell assay showed that the knockdown of PROX1-AS1 inhibited the apoptosis and promoted the migration and invasion of HTR-8\/SVneo cells. We also assessed the interactions between PROX1-AS1, caspase-9, and microRNA (miR)-211-5p via dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down analyses. The data indicated that PROX1-AS1 acted as a sponge for miR-211-5p to regulate the expression of caspase-9. Moreover, the expression of miR-211-5p was reduced in PE and negatively related to PROX1-AS1, while that of caspase-9 was increased in PE and negatively regulated by miR-211-5p. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-211-5p rescued the facilitation of cell apoptosis, migration and invasion induced by the knockdown of PROX1-AS1. We also found that caspase-9 improved the apoptosis rate, and suppressed the cell migration and invasion induced by the overexpression of miR-211-5p. In conclusion, the knockdown of PROX1-AS1 promoted the cell morbidity of the trophoblast cells by modulating the miR-211-5p\/caspase-9 axis, which may alleviate the progression of PE. This novel regulatory network may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of PE.","1602":null,"1603":"Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors.

Cell proliferation, transwell, and cell cloning assays were used to detect the effect of LINC01320 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities, respectively, of gastric cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the binding of miR-495-5p with LINC01320 and RAB19. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify their interactions. Finally, the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of LINC01320 by METTL14 was identified through RIP experiments. LINC01320 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and cells. LINC01320 overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells, while LINC01320 knockdown exerted the opposite effects. Moreover, miR-495-5p was predicted and demonstrated to target LINC01320 and RAB19. LINC01320 sponged miR-495-5p to regulate the expression of RAB19. Additionally, LINC01320-induced increases in cell viability, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer were alleviated by miR-495-5p and silenced RAB19. Furthermore, epigenetic studies showed that METTL14-mediated m6A modification led to LINC01320 up-regulation. METTL14 regulated the m6A modification of LINC01320.

This study aimed to develop a hypoxia-related long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature for predicting survival outcomes of patients with bladder cancer (BC). The transcriptome and clinicopathologic data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso regression analysis were used to screened lncRNAs. Ten lncRNAs were screened out and included into the hypoxia lncRNA signature. The risk score based on hypoxia lncRNA signature could accurately predict the survival outcomes of BC patients. Immune infiltration analysis showed that six types of immune cells had significant different infiltration. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) analysis showed that the risk scores between the wild types and the mutation types of TP53, FGFR3, and RB1 were significantly different. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that cancer-associated pathways belonged to the high risk groups and immune-related signal pathways were enriched into the low risk group. Then, we constructed a predictive model with the risk score, age, and clinical stage, which showed a robust prognostic performance. An lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network was constructed, which contained 62 lncRNA-mRNA links among 10 lncRNAs and 40 related mRNAs.

Hydrocolloids can be synthetic, plant-based, or animal-based. Increasing consumer awareness has led to the use of natural food ingredients derived from natural sources, making algae-derived hydrocolloids more appealing nowadays. Algae-derived hydrocolloids such as carrageenan, agar, and alginate are widely used in the food industry as thickening, gelling, and emulsifying agents. Carrageenans are sulfated polysaccharides with diverse structural specificities. The safety of carrageenan use in the food industry has been widely debated recently due to the reported pro-inflammatory activities of carrageenan and the probable digestion of carrageenan by the gut microbiota to generate pro-inflammatory oligosaccharides. In contrast, both agar and alginate are primarily nontoxic, and generally no dispute regarding the use of the same in food ingredients. This review provides an overview of the algae industry, the food additives, the algae-derived hydrocolloids, the applications of algae-derived hydrocolloids in food industries, health-related studies, and other sectors, along with future perspectives. Even though differences of opinion exist in the use of carrageenan, it is continued to be used by the food industry and will be used until suitable alternatives are available. In summary, algal hydrocolloids are 'label-friendly' and considered a safe option against synthetic additives.","1609":null,"1610":null,"1611":null,"1612":"Esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) is one of the most aggressive malignancies with extremely high morbidity and mortality.

Previous studies have found that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DDX11-AS1 expression enhances the paclitaxel resistance of ESCA cells. However, the mechanisms underlying the drug resistance conferred by lncRNA DDX11-AS1 in ESCA remains to be elucidated. Our research aims to clarify the role and mechanism of lncRNA DDX11-AS1 in regulating the progression of ESCA. We found that the expression of lncRNA DDX11-AS1 in ESCA tissues and cell lines was significantly upregulated. Subsequently, silencing lncRNA DDX11-AS1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCA cells, and induced the level of cell apoptosis. In terms of mechanism, our data showed that miR-514b-3p\/RING box protein 1 (RBX1) axis played a crucial role in the oncogenic function of lncRNA DDX11-AS1.

However, little is known about the exact effect of lactate transporters such as monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) on immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated the expression status and prognostic value of MCT4 in BC through large-scale transcriptome data. Our results showed that MCT4 was overexpressed in BC, particularly in the basal-like molecular subtype. Overexpression of MCT4 was significantly correlated with high BC lesion grade and poor prognosis. Enrichment analysis indicated that the MCT4-related genes were involved in immune- and metabolism-related bioprocesses, such as myeloid leukocyte activation, the adaptive immune system, and catabolic process. We also found that the expression of MCT4 in BC lesions was associated with immune cell infiltration and glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes like pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and hexokinases-3 (HK3). Our observations indicate that MCT4 may play a pivotal role in the maintenance of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) through metabolic reprogramming. The enzymes of the glycolysis pathway (MCT4, PKM2, and HK3) may thus serve as new targets to modulate the TIME and enhance immunotherapy efficiency.[Figure: see text].","1617":"The lack of efficient biomarkers is the main reason for the inaccurate early diagnosis and poor treatment outcomes of patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS).

The mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was evaluated and corrected by tumor purity. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to explore the gene modules and key genes involved in stemness characteristics. We found that mRNAsi and corrected mRNAsi scores were both greater in tumors of Grade 3 and 4 than that of Grade 1 and 2. Forty-two key genes were obtained from the most significant mRNAsi-related gene module. Functional annotation revealed that these key genes were mainly involved in the mitotic division. Thirteen potential platinum-response indicators were selected from the genes enriched to platinum-response associated pathways. Among them, we identified 11 genes with prognostic value of progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced SOC patients treated with platinum and 7 prognostic genes in patients treated with a combination of platinum and taxol. The expressions of the 13 key genes were also validated between platinum-resistant and -sensitive SOC samples of advanced stages in two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets.

Then, differentially expressed miRNAs between the two groups were obtained. LASSO logistic regression analysis was used to construct a diagnostic model to predict the level of TMB. Univariate, multivariate, and LASSO regression analysis were used to construct a prognostic risk signature (PRS) to predict the prognosis of UCEC patients.

The ESTIMATE algorithm was implemented to computer the number of immune and stromal components in EC tissues from the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. The CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to assess the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in EC tissues, which were quantified as Stromal score and Immune score. After the construction of protein-protein interaction network, cell-cell chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) was identified as a potential predictive element for EC. Further analysis indicated that a higher expression of CCR2 in EC patients was correlated with a better prognosis and a prolonged disease-free survival. According to the transcript level of CCR2, samples were separated into low- and high-expression groups. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis unveiled that metabolism-related pathways were mostly abundant in groups with high-expression, the other one was primarily correlated to immune-related activities. We figured out that some immune cells were positively related to CCR2, suggesting that CCR2 might serve as the immune-dominant status of TME, which was verified by qRT-PCR and HPA analysis in transcriptome and protein level, respectively.

PLD5 overexpression exerted a cancerous effect while mimicking of miR-145-5p reversed the PLD5-oncogenic effects and significantly inhibited PCa cells proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis.In conclusion, the study revealed that miR-145-5p upregulated apoptosis and repressed migration, invasion, and metastasis of PCa via direct PLD5 modulation.","1637":null,"1638":null,"1639":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most fatal malignancy, and despite extensive treatment, tumors inevitably recur. This study aimed to identify recurrence-associated molecules in GBM. The gene expression profile GSE139533, containing 70 primary and 47 recurrent GBM tissues and their corresponding clinical traits, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and used for weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis. After identifying the hub genes which differentially expressed in recurrent GBM tissues and in the gene modules correlated with recurrence, data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CCGA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were analyzed with GSE43378 to determine the relationship between hub genes and patient prognosis. The diagnostic value of the identified hub genes was verified using 52 GBM tissues. Three gene modules were correlated with recurrence and 2623 genes were clustered in these clinically significant modules. Among these, 13 genes - EHF, TRPM1, FXYD4, CDH15, LHX5, TP73, FBN3, TLX1, C1QL4, COL2A, SEC61G, NEUROD4 and GPR139 - were differentially expressed in recurrent GBM samples; low LHX5 and TLX1 expression predicted poor outcomes. LHX5 and TLX1 expression showed weak positive relationships with Karnofsky performance scale scores. Additionally, LHX5 and TLX1 expression was found to be decreased in our recurrent GBM samples compared with that in primary samples; these genes exhibited high diagnostic value in distinguishing recurrent samples from primary samples. Our findings indicate that LHX5 and TLX1 might be involved in GBM recurrence and act as potential biomarkers for this condition.","1640":null,"1641":null,"1642":"The ATP-dependent protein DEAD-box RNA helicase 52 (DDX52) is an important regulator in RNA biology and has been implicated in the development of prostate and lung cancer. However, its biological functions and clinical importance in malignant melanoma (MM) are still unclear. Understanding the potential mechanism underlying the regulation of MM progression by DDX52 might lead to novel therapeutic strategies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of DDX52 in the regulation of MM progression and its clinical relevance. DDX52 expression in normal and MM tissues was evaluated by GEO analysis and immunohistochemistry. The effects of DDX52 on cell growth were evaluated in MM cells with downregulated DDX52 expression. In this study, we found that DDX52 was markedly overexpressed in MM tissues compared with nontumor tissues and was associated with shorter overall survival in patients; therefore, DDX52 might be a prognostic marker in MM. Downregulation of DDX52 expression in the MM cell lines A2058 and MV3 markedly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation. Additionally, knockdown of DDX52 in MM cells caused significant regression of established tumors in nude mice and delayed the onset time. Moreover, downregulation of DDX52 markedly suppressed c-Myc mRNA and protein expression, and an RNA immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the association between DDX52 and c-Myc. Restoration of c-Myc expression partly rescued the effects of DDX52 deficiency in MM cells. In conclusion, our study found that DDX52 mediated oncogenesis by promoting the transcriptional activity of c-Myc and could be a therapeutic target in MM.","1643":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) increases the risk of fetal heart malformations, though little is known about the mechanism of hyperglycemia-induced heart malformations. Thus, we aimed to reveal the global landscape of miRNAs and mRNAs in GDM-exposed fetoplacental arterial endothelial cells (dAECs) and establish regulatory networks for exploring the pathophysiological mechanism of fetal heart malformations in maternal hyperglycemia. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were used, and identification of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and genes (DEGs) in GDM was based on a previous sequencing analysis of dAECs. A miRNA-mRNA network containing 20 DEMs and 65 DEGs was established using DEMs altered in opposite directions to DEGs. In an in vivo study, we established a streptozotocin-induced pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) mouse model and found the fetal cardiac wall thickness in different regions to be dramatically increased in the PGDM grouValidation of DEMs and DEGs in the fetal heart showed significantly upregulated expression of let-7e-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-195-5p and downregulated expression of SGOL1, RRM2, RGS5, CDK1 and CENPA. In summary, we reveal the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network related to fetal cardiac development disorders in offspring, which may shed light on the potential molecular mechanisms of fetal cardiac development disorders during maternal hyperglycemia.","1644":"Based on many studies, trichosanthin (TCS) has an antiviral effect that regulates immune response, and targets cancer cells to exert broad-spectrum anti-tumor pharmacological activities. It is speculated that TCS may be a potential natural active drug for preventing as well as treating cervical cancer. But the clearer impact along with underlying TCS mechanism on cervical cancer are still unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the function and potential mechanism of TCS in cervical cancer. We measured the viability of cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa &amp; caski cells) using CCK-8 analysis, detected cell proliferation efficiency through Ki-67 staining, analyzed cell apoptosis rate via flow cytometry as well as annexin V-FITC\/PI double staining, performed apoptosis-related protein expression through western blotting, evaluated cell migration along with invasion by wound as well as transwell assays, carried out MMP via JC-1 and Rh123 fluorescent probes, as well as detected intracellular ATP and ROS levels by flow cytometry, respectively, to evaluate the effects of TCS. We found that TCS inhibited viability along with proliferation, induced apoptosis, as well as inhibited HeLa &amp; caski cell migration along with invasion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TCS also reduced MMP, and the production of adenosine triphosphate, as well as induced the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species in cancer cell lines. In accordance with the present studies, TCS inhibits HeLa &amp; caski cell proliferation along with migration but promotes their apoptosis, which may be mediated by regulating oxidative stress.","1645":"Accumulating evidence has unveiled the pivotal roles of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). However, there are not many researches to predict the prognosis of PAAD using m6A-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Raw data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) were utilized to comprehensively analyze the expression and prognostic performances of 145 m6A-related lncRNAs in PAAD and to develop and validate a novel m6A-related multi-lncRNA prognostic signature (m6A-LPS) for PAAD patients. In total, 57 differentially expressed m6A-related lncRNAs with prognostic values were identified. Based on LASSO-Cox regression analysis, m6A-LPS was constructed and verified by using five-lncRNA expression profiles for TCGA and ICGC cohorts. PAAD patients were then divided into high- and low-risKBIE_A_1933868k subgroups with different clinical outcomes according to the median risk score; this was further verified by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves. Risk scores were significantly associated with clinical parameters such as histological grade and cancer status among PAAD patients. A nomogram consisting of risk score, grade, and cancer status was generated to predict the survival probability of PAAD patients, as also demonstrated by calibration curves. Discrepancies in cellular processes, signaling pathways, and immune status between the high- and low-risk subgroups were investigated by functional and single-sample gene set enrichment analyses.

The aim of this study was to determine the expression level of lncRNA CRNDE in PC tissues and to elucidate its role in PC. The expression levels of lncRNA CRNDE were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The role of lncRNA CRNDE in PC cells was studied using loss-of-function assays in vitro. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were assessed via Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell chamber assays. A luciferase reporter assay was used to characterize the interaction between lncRNA CRNDE and miR-146a-5p. In PC tissues, the expression level of lncRNA CRNDE was upregulated. Moreover, knockdown of lncRNA CRNDE suppressed PC cell proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in vitro. miR-146a-5p was verified as a direct target of lncRNA CRNDE. Moreover, the inhibition of miR-146a-5p partially counteracted the effects of lncRNA CRNDE on PC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, lncRNA CRNDE may serve as a cancer promoter in PC by targeting miR-146a-5p. Therefore, lncRNA CRNDE could be a promising target for the clinical treatment of PC.","1647":"Age-related skeletal muscle deterioration (sarcopenia) has a significant effect on the elderly's health and quality of life, but the molecular and gene regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. It is necessary to identify the candidate genes related to skeletal muscle aging and prospective therapeutic targets for effective treatments. The age-line-related genes (ALRGs) and age-line-related transcripts (ALRTs) were investigated using the gene expression profiles of GSE47881 and GSE118825 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were performed to identify the key molecules with Cytoscape, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to clarify the potential molecular functions. Two hub molecules were finally obtained and verified with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that the expression of mitochondria genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport, complex assembly of the respiratory chain, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP synthesis were down-regulated in skeletal muscle with aging. We further identified a primary hub gene of CYCS (Cytochrome C) and a key transcription factor of ESRRA (Estrogen-related Receptor Alpha) to be associated closely with skeletal muscle aging. PCR analysis confirmed the expressions of CYCS and ESRRA in gastrocnemius muscles of mice of different ages were significantly different, and decreased gradually with age. In conclusion, the main cause of skeletal muscle aging may be the systematically reduced expression of mitochondrial functional genes. The CYCS and ESRRA may play significant roles in the progression of skeletal muscle aging and serve as potential biomarkers for future diagnosis and treatment.","1648":"Synaptotagmins (SYTs), constitute a family of 17 membrane-trafficking protein, palying crucial roles in the development and progression of human cancers. However, only very few studies have investigated the expression profile and prognostic values of SYTs family members in gastric cancer (GC). Therefore, we comprehensively evaluated the expression, methylation, prognosis and immune significance of SYTs family members through bioinformatics analysis from the online databases in GC. The expressions of SYT4, SYT9, and SYT14 were up-regulated, and negatively associated with their methylation levels in GC. Both the over-expression of SYT4, SYT9 and SYT14 and their hypomethylation levels contributed to an unsatisfactory overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in GC. Moreover, the low expressions of several methylation cg sites (cg02795029, cg07581146, cg15149095, cg19922137, cg25371503, cg26158959, cg02269161, cg03226737, cg08185661, cg16437728, cg22723056 and cg24678137) were significantly correlated with an unfavorable OS and PFS in GC. Furthermore, the expression of SYT4, SYT9 and SYT14 played a pivotal role in immune cells infiltration in GC. Collectively, our current finding suggested that SYT4, SYT9 and SYT14 might be potent prognostic indictors and promising immunotherapeutic targets for GC patients.","1649":null,"1650":"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was considered a fatal disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality; platelet activation or aggregation plays a critical role in participating in the pathogenesis of AMI. The current study aimed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of platelets in the confrontation of AMI and potential biomarkers that separate AMI from other cardiovascular diseases and healthy people with bioinformatic strategies. Immunity analysis revealed that the neutrophil was significantly decreased in patients with SCAD compared with patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or healthy controls; monocytes and neutrophils showed potential in distinguishing patients with STEMI from patients with SCAD. Six differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed great performances in differentiating STEMI patients from SCAD patients with AUC greater than 0.9. Correlation analysis showed that these six DEGs were significantly positively correlated with neutrophils; three genes were negatively correlated with monocytes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) found that module 'royalblue' had the highest correlation with STEMI; genes in STEMI-related module were enriched in cell-cell interactions, blood vessels' biological processes, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway; four genes (FN1, CD34, LPL, and WWTR1) represented the capability of identifying patients with STEMI from healthy controls and patients with SCAD; two genes (ARG1 and NAMPTL) were considered as novel biomarkers for identifying STEMI from SCAD; FN1 represented the potential as a novel biomarker for STEMI. Our findings indicated that the distribution of neutrophils could be considered as a potential molecular trait for separating patients with STEMI from SCAD.","1651":"Recent findings have identified microbiota as crucial participants in many disease conditions, including cancers. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) is regarded as a candidate mechanism involving relevant biological processes. We therefore constructed a ceRNA network using the TCGA and GEO database, to determine the potential mechanisms of microbiota-mediated colorectal carcinogenesis and progression. We found a total of 75 lncRNAs, 8 miRNAs, and 9 mRNAs in the probiotics-mediated ceRNA network and a total of 49 lncRNAs, 4 miRNAs, and 3 mRNA in the pathobiont-mediated ceRNA network, which could induce the microbiota-mediated carcinogenesis and progression. The GO and KEGG analysis indicated that the ceRNA network is mainly enriched in the metabolic process, and two unique pathways (the p53 signaling pathway and microRNA in cancer), respectively. A four-gene signature (FRMD6-AS2, DIRC3, LIFR-AS1, and MRPL23-AS1) was suggested as an independent prognostic factor. Four lncRNAs (LINC00355, KCNQ1OT1, LINC00491, and HOTAIR) were associated with poor survival. Three small molecule candidate anticancer drugs (Pentoxyverine, Rimexolone, and Doxylamine) were identified. A four-gene signature (FAM129A, BCL2, PMAIP1, and RPS6) is significantly correlated with immune infiltration level. This study provides a promising biomarker reservoir to explore the mechanism by which microbiota regulate the ceRNA network involving the immune response, and further participate in colorectal carcinogenesis and progression.","1652":null,"1653":null,"1654":"Angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), type II transmembrane serine protease 2 and 4 (TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4) are important receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, the full-length tree shrewACE2 gene was cloned and sequenced, and its biological information was analyzed. The expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in various tissues or organs of the tree shrew were detected. The results showed that the full-length ACE2 gene in tree shrews was 2,786 bp, and its CDS was 2,418 bp, encoding 805 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis based on the CDS of ACE2 revealed that tree shrews were more similar to rabbits (85.93%) and humans (85.47%) but far from mice (82.81%) and rats (82.58%). In silico analysis according to the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor of different species predicted that tree shrews had potential SARS-CoV-2 infection possibility, which was similar to that of rabbits, cats and dogs but significantly higher than that of mice and rats. In addition, various tissues or organs of tree shrews expressed ACE2, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4. Among them, the kidney most highly expressed ACE2, followed by the lung and liver. The esophagus, lung, liver, intestine and kidney had relatively high expression levels of TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4. In general, we reported for the first time the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in various tissues or organs in tree shrews. Our results revealed that tree shrews could be used as a potential animal model to study the mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection.","1655":"Primary hippocampal neuronal cells were used to establish cell model of cerebral ischemia under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment. After the cell model was pre-treated with short hairpin (sh)-circ_NLRP1 or mmu-miR-199b-3p inhibitor, LDH release and cell apoptosis were detected by LDH kit and TUNEL staining, respectively, while the expression of NLRP3 pyroptosis-related makers was analyzed through immunofluorescence (IF) assay and Western blot, respectively. The binding sites between circ_NLRP1 and mmu-miR-199b-3p were predicted and further validated by Dual Luciferase Reporter assay. Additionally, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was also analyzed by means of Western blot assay. Neuronal cells under OGD conditions released less lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and showed less apoptosis status by silencing circ_NLRP1. In addition, gasdermin D (GSDMD)-N immunofluorescence staining showed weaker fluorescence intensity and decreased expression of pyroptosis-related mediators. We further found that mmu-miR-199b-3p-inhibitor could alter the effects of sh-circ_NLRP1 on hippocampal neuronal cells. In addition, in this process, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)\/EGR1 pathway was also significantly affected. In conclusion, OGD stimulation induced neuronal damage and pyroptosis through enhancing circ_NLRP1 expression and further downregulating mmu-miR-199b-3p levels. The present study provided a novel insight for understanding the potential mechanism of ischemia-induced neuronal damage and for developing new drugs for treating brain ischemia damage.","1656":null,"1657":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are the new regulators and biomarkers for various tumors. However, in cervical cancer (CC), the potential roles of lncRNAs are not well characterized. This research aimed at exploring the roles of MEOX2 antisense RNA 1(MEOX2-AS1) in CC progression and the underlying mechanisms. The examination of MEOX2-AS1 levels in CC specimens and cell lines was conducted by RT-PCR. Loss-of-function experiments were performed for the assays of proliferation, migration, and invasion of CC cells after various treatments. Animal experiments were applied for the determination of the effects of MEOX2-AS1 in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis, together with dual-luciferase reporter assays, was applied to demonstrate the possible relationships among MEOX2-AS1, miR-143-3p and VDAC1. In the paper, we reported that MEOX2-AS1 levels were distinctly upregulated in CC cells and tissues, and higher MEOX2-AS1 expressions indicated a poor clinical outcome. Besides, STAT1 could activate transcriptions of MEOX2-AS1 by binding directly to its promoter region. The silence of MEOX2-AS1 suppressed the metastatic and proliferative ability of CC cells, as revealed by functional assays. Mechanistically, MEOX2-AS1 sponged miR-143-3p to regulate VDAC1 expressions. Furthermore, miR-143-3p inhibitor reversed the anti-proliferation and anti-metastasis effect of MEOX2-AS1 knockdown. Overall, the data indicated that the MEOX2-AS1\/miR-143-3p\/VDAC1 pathway participated in CC progression, making it a novel therapeutic target for CC cures.","1658":null,"1659":null,"1660":null,"1661":"Circular RNAs (circ RNAs) have been found to play an important role in cancer development.

High levels of circRAB3IP was correlated with advanced TNM stage, distant metastasis. CircRAB3IP knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, circRAB3IP directly binds to miR-580-3p. TWIST1 is directly targeted by miR-580-3p. We also demonstrated that circRAB3IP act as the sponge of miR-580-3p to promote TWIST1 expression. CircRAB3IP promotes OS cells proliferation, migration, and invasion through modulating miR-580-3p\/TWIST1 axis. Moreover, circRAB3IP facilitated tumor formation in vivo.

Koch is endemic to China and has high medicinal and ornamental values. However, its seed exhibits morphophysiological dormancy, and the molecular mechanisms of which are not clearly understood. To reveal the regulation mechanism of the ABA signal in seed dormancy, the M. sieboldii ABA receptor Pyrabactin Resistance 1 (PYR1) gene was cloned and analyzed. Analysis of the MsPYR1 sequence analysis showed that the full-length cDNA contained a complete open reading frame of 987 bp and encoded a predicted protein of 204 amino acid residues. The protein had a relative molecular weight of 22.661 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 5.01. The transcript levels of MsPYR1 were immediately upregulated at 16 DAI and then decreased at 40 DAI. The highest transcript level of MsPYR1 was found in the dry seeds, indicating that the MsPYR1 gene may play an important role in the regulation of dormancy. The MsPYR1 gene cDNA was successfully expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3), and the protein bands were consistent with the prediction. The Anti-MsPYR1antibody could detect the expression of MsPYR1 in M. sieboldii.

Hence, safer and more effective options are urgently needed. Mylabris, the dried body of blister beetles, has been used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine. This study applied bioinformatics and systematic pharmacology to investigate the mechanism of action of mylabris in the treatment of leukemia. Five effective components and 35 corresponding target proteins were identified by screening the TCMSP database; whereas 776 genes related to leukemia were selected using OMIM, GeneCards, and the Therapeutic Target Database. Eight genes common to mylabris and leukemia were identified. Protein-protein interaction network analysis and a component-target-pathway diagram identified TP53 and PTEN as key gene targets of mylabris in the treatment of leukemia. GO enrichment analysis pointed to DNA damage and cell cycle disorder caused by p53 signaling as the most significant processes; whereas KEGG enrichment pointed to the p53 signaling pathway. In summary, mylabris may exert a therapeutic effect on leukemia by triggering DNA damage, inducing apoptosis, as well as inhibiting the growth and proliferation of tumor cells through the regulation of TP53 and PTEN. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the treatment of leukemia with traditional Chinese medicine.","1667":"This study aimed to investigate the expression, biological function, and downstream mechanism of LINC00511 in gastric cancer (GC). In paired GC samples, LINC00511, miR-625-5p and STAT3 mRNA expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); STAT3 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemical (IHC). The gain-of-function and loss-of-function models were established, and the proliferative and migrative ability of GC cells were measured by CCK-8 and transwell assays, respectively. The regulatory relationship between miR-625-5p and LINC00511 or STAT3 was examined by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter gene assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot. We reported that LINC00511 and STAT3 expressions in GC tissues and cell lines were observably up-regulated, while miR-625-5p expression was inhibited. High expression of LINC00511 could facilitate the proliferation and promote the migration of GC cells. miR-625-5p was proved to be a downstream target of LINC00511, and LINC00511 could induce the expression of STAT3 by inhibiting the expression of miR-625-5p. Additionally, knockdown of LINC00511 suppressed the growth and lung metastases of CRC cells in nude mice.

Once a large amount of UVB accumulates within a short period of time, skin tissue can become inflamed. It has also been found in clinics that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can promote wound repair; therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the mechanism by which PRP repairs UVB-induced skin photodamage. We used PRP of Sprague-Dawley rats with the two-spin technique in the established acute UVB radiation photodamage model and harvested the corresponding skin after 1, 7, and 28 d. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe tissue inflammation. We found that PRP reduces inflammation in the early stages of UVB-induced acute skin damage, and then promotes the proliferation of collagen in the middle and late stages. Moreover, PRP can stimulate Act A and M1 polarization in the early stage, while inhibiting activin A (Act A) and inducing M2 polarization in the middle and late stages. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that PRP plays an important regulatory role in helping reduce UVB-induced acute skin tissue inflammation by adjusting macrophage polarization, which alleviates skin inflammation and stimulates collagen regeneration.","1669":null,"1670":"It is found that the activation of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway is related to the degree of inflammation in patients suffering from periodontitis. Cullin3 (CUL3), an important ubiquitin ligase, can control SHH signaling. In this study, we were dedicated to clarify the roles of SHH and CUL3 in P. gingivalis-LPS (Pg-LPS)-treated periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). In this study, cell viability was detected using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). The inflammatory cytokines of PDLSCs were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). With the application of western blots, the protein levels of SHH, Gli1 and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were determined. Alkaline phosphatase staining and Alizarin red staining were performed to evaluate the differentiation and mineralization capabilities of PDLSCs. The apoptotic cells were screened using TUNEL staining. The results showed that Pg-LPS inhibited cell viability and triggered inflammation of PDLSCs. Overexpression of CUL3 weakened the differentiation and mineralization capabilities of PDLSCs. Moreover, CUL3 overexpression aggravated inflammation and cell apoptosis induced by Pg-LPS. It is worth noting that although the protein levels of SHH, Gli1 and Nrf2 were elevated in PDLSCs treated with Pg-LPS, overexpression of CUL3 decreased the expressions of Gli1 and Nrf2.

Here, we demonstrate that the 17 m6A RNA methylation regulators are differentially expressed in ovarian cancer and normal tissues. By using consensus clustering, all ovarian cancer patients can be divided into two subgroups (cluster 1 and 2) based on the expression of 17 m6A RNA methylation regulators. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we identified that cluster 1 was most connected to oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Regression models identified that prognosis is associated with HNRNPA2B1, KIAA1429, and WTAP. qRT-PCR result show that the expression trends of HNRNPA2B1 and KIAA1429 are consistent with the predicted results. Multivariate Cox regression analysis results show that the risk score was an independent predictive factor in OV. The overall survival of high-risk patients was significantly shorter than that of low-risk patients. ROC curve analysis showed that the prognostic signature precisely predicted the 5-year survival of OV patients. A nomogram was developed to predict each patient's survival probability and well calibrated and showed a satisfactory discrimination. Dendritic fraction, macrophage fraction, and neutrophil fraction showed higher fraction in high-risk patients.

On the other hand, recent advances in aquaculture nutrition have created several potential fish meal replacements, and the assessment of their nutrient digestibility is critical in the application as a fish meal replacement. Using an in-vitro method, the assessment of an ingredient digestibility could be faster and less expensive compared to using an in-vivo experiment. An in-vitro method has been widely used to assess food nutrient digestibility for humans; however, its application for fish is still in the early stages. Both the human and fish as monogastric vertebrates share similar gastrointestinal systems; thus, the concept from the application for humans could be applied for fish.

Functional assays indicated that MYLK-AS1 silencing retarded the proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion in GC. Besides, in vivo assay validated that MYLK-AS1 deficiency also restrained tumor growth. Through in-depth mechanism exploration, MYLK-AS1 was uncovered to bind with wnhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an epigenetic inhibitor, to inhibit the level of Large Tumor Suppressor 2 (LATS2), thereby exerting carcinogenicity. Conclusively, our research highlighted the importance of MYLK-AS1 in GC, indicating that MYLK-AS1 might be an effective biomarker for GC.[Figure: see text].","1676":"Asthma is mentioned as a chronic airway inflammatory disease, whose pathogenesis is complicated. The promotion of inflammation in asthma by IL-17A and IL-17F has been confirmed. In addition to covalent homodimers, both cytokines are also able to form heterodimers, further inducing downstream pathways via binding to the IL-17RA and IL-17RC receptor complex. In recent years, IL-17RA and its signal transduction pathway have been extensively researched. IL-17RC, however, remains relatively unexplored. In the present study, we self-assembled chitosan (CS) nanoparticles for intranasal delivery of recombinant protein IL-17RC (rIL-17RC) and preliminarily investigated its effect on a murine model of allergic asthma induced by ovalbumin (OVA). rIL-17RC was produced by the prokaryotic expression system and encapsulated into the CS nanoparticles via ionic cross-linking technique. The results showed that CS-RC nanoparticles via intranasal intervention significantly caused inhibition of mucus secretion and airway inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced IL-4, IL-17, IL-17F levels in BALF. Hence, delivering receptor proteins such as IL-17RC, through CS nanoparticles as a carrier, could be an attractive therapeutic intervention for asthma.","1677":null,"1678":"Aberrant expression of the chemokine CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4) is closely associated with cancer progression and drug-resistance in multiple cancers, and we first investigated the role of CXCR4 in regulating cancer pathogenesis and cisplatin (DDP)-resistance in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in the present study. Here, we identified that CXCR4 acted as an oncogene to promote cancer progression and genetically silencing of CXCR4 increased cisplatin (DDP)-sensitivity in ccRCC in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, analysis from the clinical and cellular data indicated that CXCR4 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC tissues and cells, compared to their normal counterparts. Next, the loss-of-function experiments validated that knock-down of CXCR4 suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ccRCC cells, while CXCR4 overexpression had opposite effects on the above cellular functions. Consistently, the xenograft tumor-bearing mice models were established, and the results supported that knock-down of CXCR4 inhibited tumor growth and the expression levels of Ki67 protein in vivo. In addition, the ccRCC cells were exposed to DDP treatment, and we surprisingly found that upregulation of CXCR4 increased DDP-resistance in ccRCC cells, and conversely, CXCR4 ablation sensitized ccRCC cells to DDP stimulation. Taken together, we concluded that CXCR4 ablation hindered cancer progression and enhanced DDP-sensitivity in ccRCC, and the present study identified a novel therapeutic biomarker for ccRCC.","1679":"The clinicopathological value of microRNA-141-3p (miR-141-3p) and its prospective target genes in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains unclear. The present study determined the expression level of miR-141-3p in EC via quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). RT-qPCR showed a markedly higher expression level of miR-141-3p in EC tissues than in non-EC endometrium tissues (P &lt; 0.0001). The microarray and miRNA-seq data revealed upregulation of miR-141-3p. Integrated analysis based on 675 cases of EC and 63 controls gave a standardized mean difference of 1.737, confirmed the upregulation of miR-141-3p. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that a higher expression of miR-141-3p positively corelated with a poorer prognosis. Combining the predicted targets and downregulated genes in EC, we obtained 271 target genes for miR-141-3p in EC. Two potential targets, PPP1R12A and PPP1R12B, were downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. This study indicates that the overexpression of miR-141-3p may play an important part in the carcinogenesis of EC. The overexpression of miR-141-3p may be a risk factor for the prognosis of patients with EC.","1680":"Circular RNA (circRNA), a recently identified endogenous non-coding RNA molecule, regulates gene expression in mammals. At the current stage, the expression and function of circRASSF2 in breast cancer (BC) have not been clarified. According to our study, it is found that circRASSF2 sequences contain miR-1205 binding sites, and Homeobox gene A1 (HOXA1) is the target gene of miR-1205. Besides, the clinical observations and histopathologic study reveal that the expression of circRASSF2 increased to a significant extent in BC tissues and serum. Additionally, it is found that circRASSF2 expression had a positive correlation with distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, differentiation and tumor size, and that overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of circRASSF2 high expression BC patients were inferior to those with low circRASSF2 expression. In vitro study, an overt decrease was detected in the proliferation, clone formation ability, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in cells when circRASSF2 was knocked down. We confirmed the direct interaction between circRASSF2, miR-1205 and HOXA1 by a dual luciferase reporter system. Additionally, our study revealed that over-expression of miR-1205 decreased HOXA1 protein expression, and HOXA1 protein expression decreased when circRASSF2 were knocked down, and when miR-1205 expression was inhibited, HOXA1 expression was significantly increased. In conclusion, our study suggests that circRASSF2 regulates BC progression through the miR-1205\/HOXA1 pathway. Our findings suggest the prospect of circRASSF2 serving as therapeutic target as such to cure BC patients.","1681":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease involving multiple organs. However, the underlying etiology and mechanisms remain unclear. This study was performed to identify potential therapeutic targets for SLE using bioinformatics methods. First, 584 differentially expressed genes were identified based on the GSE61635 dataset. Tissue-specific analyses, enrichment analyses, and Protein-Protein interaction network were successively conducted. Furthermore, ELISA was performed to confirm the expression levels of key genes in the control and SLE blood samples. The findings revealed that tissue-specific expression of markers of the hematological system (25.5%, 28\/110) varied significantly. CCL2, MMP9, and RSAD2 expression was markedly increased in the SLE samples compared with controls. In conclusion, the identified key genes (CCL2, MMP9, and RSAD2) may act as possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of SLE.","1682":"Ultrasound (US) is reported to improve the delivery efficiency of drugs loading onto large nanoparticles due to the sonoporation effect. Microbubbles (MBs) can be used as contrast agents of US expanding and contracting under low-amplitude US pressure waves. Ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMBs) therapy is a promising option for the treatment of various cancers as a radiosensitizer. However, its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unknown. In our study, human ESCC cell lines (KYSE-410, KYSE-1140) were treated with radiation solely, US alone, or radiation in combination with US or USMBs. The migration and invasion abilities of ESCC cells were examined by wound healing and Transwell assays. ESCC cell apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry analysis and TUNEL assays. The levels of proteins associated with cell apoptosis and angiogenesis were measured by western blot analysis. A tube formation assay was performed to detect the ESCC cell angiogenesis. We found that USMBs at high levels most effectively most efficiently enhanced the effect of radiation, and significant changes in the viability (48%-51%), proliferation (1%), migration (63%-71%), invasion (52%) and cell apoptosis (31%-50%) of ESCC cells were observed compared with the control group in vitro. The ESCC angiogenesis was inhibited by US or radiation treatment and further inhibited by a combination of radiation and US or USMBs. USMBs at high levels most effectively enhanced the inhibitory effect of radiotherapy on ESCC cell apoptosis. Overall, USMBs enhanced the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells.Graphical abstractUSMBs treatment enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiation on ESCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and apoptosis in vitro.1USMBs enhance the radiation-induced inhibition on ESCC cell growth2USMBs promote the radiation effect on ESCC cell apoptosis3USMBs enhance radiation-caused suppression on ESCC cell migration and invasion4USMBs enhance the suppression of radiation on ESCC angiogenesis[Figure: see text].","1683":"EMT-related gene expression reportedly exhibits correlation with the anti-tumor immunity of T cells. In the present study, we explored the factors that might affect the efficacy of immunotherapy in colon cancer with treatment. In this regard, RNA-seq and clinical data of 469 colon cancer samples derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to calculate infiltrating T-cell abundance (ITA), to illustrate a pathway enrichment analysis, and to construct Cox proportional hazards (CPH) regression models. Subsequently, the RNA-seq and clinical data of 177 colon cancer samples derived from the GSE17536 cohort were used to validate the CPH regression models. We found that ITA showed correlation with EMT-related gene expression, and that it was not an independent prognostic factor for colon cancer. However, upon comparison of two groups with the same ITA, higher EMT expression helped predicted a worse prognosis, whereas a higher ITA could help predict a better prognosis upon comparison of two groups with the same EMT. Additionally, seven genes were found to be statistically related to the prognosis of patients with colon cancer. These results suggest that the balance between ITA and EMT-related gene expression is conducive to the prognosis of patients with colon cancer, and TPM1 is necessary to further explore the common target genes of immune checkpoint blockade.","1684":null,"1685":"This study examined whether activation of zinc finger protein 750\/Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (ZNF750\/RAC1) signaling pathway may be involved in the ability of resveratrol to inhibit malignant progression of CAL-27 oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. CAL-27 cells were treated with resveratrol and transfected with plasmids expressing a ZNF750 mimic or ZNF750 inhibitor. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed. Western blotting was used to examine the effects of resveratrol on levels of angiogenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), G protein signal-regulated protein 5 (RGS5), integrin A5 (ITGA5), integrin B1 (ITGB1), CD44, RAC1, and ZNF750. Quantitative PCR was used to examine the effects on mRNA levels of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFB), tumor vascular marker CD105, and cell adhesion molecules ITGA5, ITGB1, and CD44. Resveratrol downregulated angiogenin, VEGF, RGS5, CD105, and the cell adhesion molecules ITGA5, ITGB1, and CD44 expressions to inhibit the vascular normalization, metastasis, adhesion, and migration of CAL-27 cells. Conversely, it upregulated ZNF750, PHD2, and PDGFB to suppress the malignant progression of CAL-27 cells. We further observed that these changes were associated with reduced proliferation, reduced colony formation, and increased apoptosis in cancer cells. ZNF750 silencing partly reversed these effects of resveratrol on the proliferation and apoptosis of CAL-27 cells. Additionally, RAC1 agonist also weakened these impacts of resveratrol on the growth of CAL-27 cells. The ability of resveratrol to suppress the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma may involve activation of the ZNF750\/RAC1 signaling pathway and modification of the tumor vascular microenvironment.","1686":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disease that significantly impacts the quality of life of the elderly population. Recently, the pathogenesis of OA has been reported to involve autophagy in chondrocytes. Intriguingly, icariin, one of the main components of epimedium, exerts multiple pharmacological effects, including a protective effect against chondrocyte damage. Thus, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of icariin on OA and its potential underlying mechanism by using a rat model of OA. After treatment with icariin or an autophagy activator (rapamycin) or inhibitor (3-methyladenine), OA chondrocyte viability was measured using the CCK-8 assay, apoptosis in the chondrocytes was evaluated using the acridine orange-propidium iodide assay and flow cytometry, and OA tissue pathological state was assessed using micro-CT scanning and safranin O staining. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining was used to measure the expression level of Beclin-1 and immunofluorescence labeling was used to visualize LC3 expression, and western blotting was used to determine the expression levels of autophagy proteins and key proteins in the PI3K signaling pathway. The apoptotic rate of OA chondrocytes was markedly elevated by 3-methyladenine and suppressed by rapamycin and icariin; autophagy genes were drastically downregulated in the 3-methyladenine group and upregulated in the rapamycin and icariin groups; and the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway was activated by 3-methyladenine and inhibited by rapamycin and icariin. Notably, following treatment with rapamycin and icariin, the severe pathological state in OA cartilage tissues was substantially alleviated, and this was accompanied by activated autophagy and inhibited PI3K signaling in the cartilage tissues. Taken together, these findings indicate that icariin alleviates OA by regulating the autophagy of chondrocytes by mediating PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling.","1687":null,"1688":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a very important role in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study focuses on the effects of miR-9 on the regulation of AML cells and their related signaling pathways. We found that the expression of miR-9 was significantly decreased in four AML cell lines (THP-1, HL-60, TF-1 and KG-1) compared with the human normal bone marrow cells (HS-5). Moreover, miR-9 overexpression inhibited HL-60 cell proliferation ability, and promoted apoptosis. However, interfering with miR-9 expression promoted the proliferation of HL-6 cells and inhibited apoptosis. Western blotting results subsequently showed that overexpression of miR-9 could elevate the expression of MAT1, LATS1, and LATS2 in HL-60 cells, and inhibit the expression of YAP, while the interference with miR-9 had the opposite result. Taken together, miR-9 may act as a tumor suppressor by activating the Hippo\/YAP signaling pathway of AML cells, which in this way supply ideas for the clinical remedy of AML patients.","1689":null,"1690":"The aim of this study was to identify hub genes closely related to the pathogenesis and prognosis of thyroid carcinoma (THCA) by integrated bioinformatics analysis. In this study, through differential gene expression analysis, 1916 and 665 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and 7 and 11 co-expressed modules were identified from the TCGA-THCA and GSE153659 datasets, respectively, by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. We identified 162 overlapping genes between the DEGs and co-expression module genes as candidate hub genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of the 162 overlapping DEGs identified significant functions and pathways of THCA, such as thyroid hormone generation and metabolic process. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis detected the top 10 hub genes (QSOX1, WFS1, EVA1A, FSTL3, CHRDL1, FABP4, PRDM16, PPARGC1A, PPARG, COL23A1). Finally, survival analysis, clinical correlation analysis, and protein abundance validation confirmed that 3 of the 10 hub genes were associated with survival prognosis of patients with THCA, and 8 of them were associated with the clinical stages of THCA. In summary, we identified hub genes and key modules that were closely related to THCA, and validated these genes by survival analysis, clinical correlation analysis, and Human Protein Atlas image analysis. Our results provide important information that will help to elucidate the pathogenesis of THCA and identify novel candidate prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.","1691":null,"1692":"In order to explore new prediction methods and key genes for gastric cancer. Firstly, we downloaded the 6 original sequencing data of gastric cancer on the Illumina HumanHT-12 platform from Array Expression and Gene Expression Omnibus, and used bioinformatics methods to identify 109 up-regulated genes and 271 down-regulated genes. Further, we performed univariate Cox regression analysis of prognostic-related genes, then used Lasso regression to remove collinearity, and finally used multivariate Cox regression to analyze independent prognostic genes (MT1M, AKR1C2, HEYL, KLK11, EEF1A2, MMP7, THBS1, KRT17, RPESP, CMTM4, UGT2B17, CGNL1, TNFRSF17, REG1A). Based on these, we constructed a prognostic risk proportion signature, and found that patients with high-risk gastric cancer have a high degree of malignancy. Subsequently, we used the GSE15459 data set to verify the signature. By calculating the area under the recipient operator characteristic curve of 5-year survival rate, the test set and verification set are 0.739 and 0.681, respectively, suggesting that the prognostic signature has a moderate prognostic ability. The nomogram is used to visualize the prognostic sig-nature, and the calibration curve verification showed that the prediction accuracy is higher. Finally, we verified the expression and prognosis of the hub gene, and suggested that HEYL, MMP7, THBS1, and KRT17 may be potential prognostic biomarkers.","1693":"Cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS) is the most common type of stroke, which is highly hazardous. This investigation aims to analyze the correlation of miR-497 with CIS, so as to provide reliable evidence for clinical response to CIS and lay a solid foundation for follow-up research. Eighty-nine CIS patients and 39 concurrent physical examinees selected between June 2017 and October 2018 were enrolled as the research participants. Additionally, SD rats with increased miR-497 expression and normal SD rats were purchased for CIS modeling to observe the clinical implications of miR-497 in CIS, as well as the water content of brain tissue and neuronal apoptosis of rats. miR-497 expression was lower in CIS patients than in physical examinees, and that in patients with complete stroke (CS) was the lowest, which increased after treatment. As determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, miR-497 had an outstanding diagnostic efficacy for CIS and was negatively correlated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and MDA concentration, while positively related to SOD concentration. Prognostic follow-up demonstrated that decreased miR-497 expression in patients after treatment predicted an increased risk of prognostic death and recurrence. However, observed in rats, the water content of the brain tissue of rats with increased miR-497 expression was reduced, and the neuronal apoptosis rate of the brain tissue was inhibited. Taken together, with low expression in CIS, miR-497 is strongly related to CIS progression and is a candidate CIS marker.","1694":"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and the identification of additional therapeutic targets and biomarkers has become vital. The A1-chimaerin (CHN1) gene encodes a ras-related protein that can be activated or inactivated by binding to GTP or GDP. The present study aimed to assess the expression of CHN1 in GC tissue and cells, to explore its relationship with GC progression, and to discover the potential mechanisms underlying these associations. The ONCOMINE database and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to determine the transcriptional levels of CHN1 in GC. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used for detecting protein expression. Correlations between CHN1 levels and the clinical outcomes of GC patients were examined using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Moreover, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to estimate immune cell infiltration. In GC patients, CHN1 transcription and CHN1 protein expression were upregulated, and a high expression of CHN1 was remarkably linked to poor survival in GC patients. CHN1 expression was associated with immune infiltrates and this gene showed potential involvement in multiple cancer-related pathways. Furthermore, the expression of CHN1 was correlated with the immunotherapeutic response. Finally, our results indicated that the pro-carcinogenic role of CHN1 may involve DNA methylation. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing CHN1 expression in GC. Our results show that high CHN1 levels could be used as a clinical biomarker for poor prognosis and that CHN1 inhibitors may have potential as anti-cancer drugs.","1695":"Due to the important role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in breast cancer, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes with m6A modification may also be involved in breast cancer pathogenesis. In this study, we used a public genome-wide association study dataset to identify m6A-SNPs associated with breast cancer and to further explore their potential functions. We found 113 m6A-SNPs associated with breast cancer that reached the genome-wide suggestive threshold (5.0E-05), and 86 m6A-SNPs had eQTL signals. Only six genes were differentially expressed between controls and breast cancer cases in GEO datasets (GSE15852, GSE115144, and GSE109169), and the SNPs rs4829 and rs9610915 were located next to the m6A modification sites in the 3'UTRs of TOM1L1 and MAFF, respectively. In addition, we found that polyadenylate-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 might have a potential interaction with rs4829 (TOM1L1) and rs9610915 (MAFF). In summary, these findings indicated that the SNPs rs4829 and rs9610915 are potentially associated with breast cancer because they had eQTL signals, altered gene expression, and were located next to the m6A modification sites in the 3'UTRs of their coding genes. However, further studies are still needed to clarify how genetic variation affects the epigenetic modification, m6A, and its subsequent functions in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.","1696":"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women; thus, more cancer prevention research is urgently needed. The aim of this study was to predict potential therapeutic agents for breast cancer and determine their molecular mechanisms using integrated bioinformatics. Summary data from a large genome-wide association study of breast cancer was derived from the UK Biobank. The gene expression profile of breast cancer was from the Oncomine database. We performed a network-wide association study and gene set enrichment analysis to identify the significant genes in breast cancer. Then, we performed Gene Ontology analysis using the STRING database and conducted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis using Cytoscape software. We verified our results using the Gene Expression Profile Interactive Analysis, PROgeneV2, and Human Protein Atlas databases. Connectivity map analysis was used to identify small-molecule compounds that are potential therapeutic agents for breast cancer.

We compared the oral microbiota communities of migraine patients (26) with healthy subjects (29) via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Alpha diversity indices were higher in migraine group compared with control group, whereas beta diversity indices also showed significant difference. A total of 23 genera were found differentially abundant between migraine and control groups.

Long non-coding RNA NEAT1 (lncRNA NEAT1) was reported to be involved in the expression of the inflammasomes, while the regulatory effect of NEAT1 on SCI was poorly investigated. Herein, we carried out further studies on the pathogenesis of SCI. PC-12 cells were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammation. Western blotting assay was used to measure the protein expression levels. RNA expression levels were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Cell counting kit 8 and flow cytometry assays were used to separately determine the cell viability and apoptosis rate. The targeted relationships were verified by luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. It was found that LPS induced inflammation in the PC-12 cells, leading to significantly higher cell apoptosis rate and lower viability, and the expression level of NEAT1 was elevated by LPS. However, knockdown of NEAT1 partially reversed the effects of LPS. Subsequently, the potential interaction between NEAT1 and miR-211-5p was validated and miR-211-5p inhibitor was further confirmed to antagonize the effects of NEAT knockdown. The downstream target gene of miR-211-5p was predicted and verified to be MAPK1. In addition, overexpression of MAPK1 was proved to antagonize the effects of NEAT1 knockdown.

Logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and SignalP 3.0 server were used to identify the potential role of genes in predicting diagnosis in patients with MI. Principal component analysis (PCA), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, area under the curve (AUC) analyses, and C-index were used to estimate the diagnostic value of genes in patients with MI. The association was validated using six other independent data sets. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis was conducted based on the aforementioned potential genes. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the genes in MI. Forty-four DEGs were selected from the GSE66360 dataset. A three-gene signature consisting of CCL20, IL1R2, and ITLN1 could effectively distinguish patients with MI. The three-gene signature was validated in seven independent cohorts. Functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to reveal the involvement of the three-gene signature in inflammation-related biological processes and pathways. Moreover, diagnostic meta-analysis results of the three-gene signature showed that the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for MI were 0.80, 0.90, and 0.93, respectively.

Overexpressed lncRNA HOTAIR offset ginsenoside-Rg3 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. Furthermore, ginsenoside-Rg3 decreased the expression of p-AKT, p-PI3K, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), which was reversed after the treatment of HOTAIR. LncRNA HOTAIR was overexpressed in SMMC-7721 cells. Ginsenoside-Rg3 could reduce the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR, resulting in the inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

Our study showed that the KAT2B expression in cervical carcinoma tissues was inferior to that in normal tissues; decreased KAT2B expression was signally related to increased T staging, lymph node metastasis together with tissue differentiation; patients with high KAT2B expression had better prognosis. After knocking down KAT2B, cell proliferation diminished with decreased cell migration and invasion. Additionally, knocking down KAT2B made for increasing EMT-related proteins N-cadherin and Vimentin expression, while ZO-1 expression decreased; overexpression had the opposite effect. Dual luciferase analysis affirmed that miR-93-5p could in specifical bind to KAT2B, and thus reducing its expression and activity.

As a result, a total of 12 lncRNAs and 711 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in the diabetic subdermal endothelial cells compared with normal controls. A ceRNA network was established, which was composed of seven lncRNA nodes, 49 miRNA nodes, 58 mRNA nodes and 183 edges, and MSC-AS1 and LINC01550 may serve as key nodes. GO function enrichment analysis showed enrichments of epithelial cell proliferation, intercellular junction, and cell adhesion molecule binding. KEGG pathway analysis revealed 33 enriched pathways. PPI protein interaction analysis identified 57 potential ceRNA-related proteins. Overall, this study suggests that multiple lncRNAs, specifically MSC-AS1 and LINC01550, may play an important role in DV development and they are like to be developed as the therapeutic targets for DV. However, further experiments in vitro and in vivo should be conducted to validate our results.","1709":"In recent years, genes associated with N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification were found to participate in modulation of multiple tumor biological processes. Concomitantly, the significantly complicated dual effects of tumor microenvironment have been observed on cancer progression. The present study aims to investigate m6A-related immune genes (m6AIGs) for their signatures and prognostic values in bladder cancer (BC). Out of 2856 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of BC, a total of 85 genes were obtained following intersection of DEGs, immune genes and m6A-related genes. The results of multivariate Cox regression analysis illustrated four genes (BGN, GRK5, IL32, and SREBF1) were significantly associated with the prognosis of BC patients. The BC samples were divided into two types based on the consensus clustering, and the principal component analysis demonstrated a separation between them. It was found that high expression of BGN and GRK5 were linked with advanced T and N stage, and the expression of SREBF1 in early T stage was higher than that in advanced T stage. Subsequently, the nomogram to predict 3- and 5-year survival probability of BC patients was developed and calibrated. GSEA analysis for risk subgroups showed WNT and TGF-beta signaling pathways were involved in regulation of BC progression in high risk level group. In the low risk level group, cytosolic DNA-Sensing cGAS-STING and RIG-I-like receptors signaling pathways were found to be correlated with BC development. These findings provide a novel insight on studies for BC progression.","1710":"Sepsis, resulting from a harmful or damaging response to infection, is a complex and severe disease that causes high mortality. Three independent expression profiles of miRNA - GSE94717, GSE149764, and GSE101639 - were collected and integrated to analyze miRNAs associated with sepsis. One miRNA, miR-223-3p, was detected significantly downregulated in patients with sepsis. The upregulated miR-223-3p target genes in patients with sepsis were enriched in central carbon metabolism associated with HIF-1 signaling and galactose metabolism. Specially, three HIF-1 signaling genes - hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A), hexokinase 2 (HK2), and MAP kinase-interacting serine\/threonine-protein kinase 1 (MKNK1) - were found significantly upregulated in patients with sepsis. Additionally, MKNK1 expression was downregulated in septic responders to early therapeutic treatments. Neutrophils were significantly accumulated in patients with sepsis and decreased in responders after therapy; MKNK1 was significantly positively correlated with neutrophils. Our findings indicate MKNK1, one targets of miR-223-3p, might be involved in sepsis via regulating the neutrophils abundance by mediating the expression inflammation factors.","1711":"The hippocampus plays a key role in memory formation and learning. According to the concept of active systems memory consolidation, transiently stored memory traces are transferred from the hippocampus into the neocortex for permanent storage. This phenomenon relies on hippocampal network oscillations, particularly sharp wave ripples [SPW-Rs). In this process prior saved data in the hippocampus may be reactivated. Recent investigations reveal that several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, etc., suppress SPW-Rs activity in rodents' hippocampal slices. This suppression of SPW-Rs may depend on various presynaptic and postsynaptic parameters including decrease in calcium influx, hyperpolarization\/depolarization and alteration in gap junctions' function in pyramidal cells. In this study, we demonstrate the impact of calcium influx and gap junctions on pyramidal cells for the modulation of SPW-Rs in a computational model of CA1.We used,SPW-Rs model with some modifications. SPW-Rs are simulated with gradual reduction of calcium and with decreasing conductance through gap junctions in PCs. Both, with calcium reduction as well as with conductance reduction through gap junctions, SPW-Rs are suppressed. Both effects add up synergistically in combination.","1712":null,"1713":null,"1714":null,"1715":null,"1716":"Our study seeks to obtain data which help to assess the impacts and related mechanisms of microRNA miR-509-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that the expression of miR-509-3p was down-regulated and Twist was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines (HepG2, HCCLM3, Bel7402, and SMMC7721) compared with the adjacent normal tissues and normal human hepatocyte (L02). Moreover, cell proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells were appeared to be markedly suppressed by overexpressed miR-509-3p. Overexpression of miR-509-3p also performed inhibition of the growth and metastasis in vivo. In addition, miR-509-3p could target and inhibit Twist expression, and it could further reverse the tumor promotion by Twist in HCC. All in all, miR-509-3p overexpression causes inhibition of the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of HCC cells by negatively regulating Twist, thereby suppressing HCC development and metastasis.","1717":null,"1718":"The unclear pathogenesis mechanisms and resistance of cancer cells to chemical drugs serious limits the development of effective treatment strategies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we managed to investigate this issue, and identify potential cancer associated biomarkers for NSCLC diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This study found that miR-6734-3p was downregulated in both NSCLC clinical specimens (tissues and serum) and cells, compared to the normal tissues and cells. Next, upregulation of miR-6734-3p inhibited cancer formation and progression in NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, miR-6734-3p ablation had opposite effects and facilitated NSCLC development. In addition, miR-6734-3p bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) mRNA to suppress its expressions in NSCLC cells. Interestingly, the inhibiting effects of miR-6734-3p overexpression on NSCLC progression were abrogated by upregulating ZEB2. Furthermore, both upregulated miR-6734-3p and silencing of ZEB2 increased cisplatin-sensitivity in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC (CR-NSCLC) cells. Taken together, miR-6734-3p played an anti-tumor role to hinder cancer development and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin treatment on NSCLC cells by downregulating ZEB2.","1719":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common complication of pregnancy, harms the health of pregnant women and fetuses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) dysregulation in placenta is involved in GDM. Herein, we explored the roles of miR-362-5p in GDM. After high glucose (HG) treated HTR-8\/SVneo cells, CCK-8 and flow cytometry were conducted to assess the capability of the proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. The data demonstrated that HG inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of HTR-8\/SVneo cells. MiR-362-5p level was reduced in HG-treated cells and placenta tissues of GDM patients, measured by qPCR. Overexpressed miR-362-5p accelerated the proliferation and restrained apoptosis of HG-treated cells. Furthermore, glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR) was verified as a target of miR-362-5p, through TargetScan database and dual-luciferase reporter assay. GSR was upregulated in GDM placenta tissues and was negatively regulated by miR-362-5p. Enforced GSR level abolished the effects of miR-362-5p overexpression on the proliferation and apoptosis of HTR-8\/SVneo cells. Furthermore, miR-362-5p increased p-PI3K, p-AKT and bcl-2, while reduced bax and cleaved caspase3, which were abolished by GSR. In conclusion, miR-362-5p promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis via targeting GSR and activating PI3K\/AKT pathway. The findings mentioned above suggested that miR-362-5p might be a therapy target of GDM.","1720":"This study aims to explore biomarkers associated with vitiligo and analyze the pathological role of immune cell infiltration in the disease.

Then, the comprehensive strategy of combined weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and logical regression of the selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm are employed to screen and biomarkers associated with vitiligo. Finally, the immune cell infiltration of vitiligo was evaluated by CIBERSORT, and the correlation between biomarkers and infiltrating immune cells was analyzed. Herein, we identified 131 robust DEGs, and enrichment analysis results showed that robust DEGs and melanogenesis were closely associated with vitiligo development and progression. TYR, TYRP1, DCT and LARP7 were identified as vitiligo-related biomarkers. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated that CD4 T Cell, CD8 T Cell, Tregs, NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages were involved in vitiligo's pathogenesis.

Studies have shown that exosomal miRNAs from cancer cells play an important role in mediating the cellular environment. The objective was to investigate the effect of OSCC-derived exosomes microRNA-221 (miR-221) in OSCC. We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting to determine PIK3R1 and miR-221 expressions in OSCC tissue or peripheral blood serum. Exosomes of OSCC cell line CAL27 were extracted and characterized. Exosomal miR-221 expression was detected by qRT-PCR. Dual-luciferase was performed to validate the targeted regulatory relationship of miR-221 on PIK3R1. Transwell and tube formation assay were applied to detect the effect of OSCC-derived exosomal miR-221 on HUVEC migration and angiogenesis. qRT-PCR confirmed that PIK3R1 expression was downregulated in OSCC tissue and cell line, while miR-221 expression was upregulated. miR-221 expression in OSCC cell line-derived exosome elevated. miR-221 could target and negatively regulate PIK3R1 expression. In addition, OSCC-derived miR-221 could promote HUVEC migration and angiogenesis. In conclusion, OSCC-derived exosomal miR-221 could target and negatively regulate PIK3R1 expression, as well as promote vascular endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis.","1722":"The study aims to explore potential mechanisms of YiSui NongJian formula (YSNJF) in treating myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) by network pharmacology-based strategy. Active compounds and corresponding potential therapeutic targets of YSNJF were harvested by utilizing the database of TCMSP (Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology) and BATMAN-TCM (Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine). MDS targets were adopted from GeneCard, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), TTD (Therapeutic Target Database), DrugBank, and DisGeNet. Then a network of YSNJF- compounds-target-MDS network was harvested. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was then generated by the Sting database and subjected to Cytoscape software to harvest major and core targets network by topological analysis. Genes from the core targets network were further subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analysis to figure out potential targeting pathways. Finally, a compounds-targets-pathways network was generated by Cytoscape. A total of 210 active compounds and 768 corresponding potential therapeutic targets were harvested from ingredients of YSNJF. MDS was shown to have 772 potential treating targets with 98 intersected targets corresponding to 98 active compounds in YSNJF. Topological analysis revealed that 15 targets formed the core PPI network. Further, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that those core targets were mainly enriched on cell cycle- and immune-related pathways. The present study revealed that therapeutic effects of YSNJF on MDS might be achieved through regulating cell cycle- and immune-related pathways.","1723":"Fluoxetine is used to improve cognition, exercise ability, depression, and neurological functions in patients with cerebral ischemic stroke. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important regulatory roles in multiple diseases. However, studies regarding the fluoxetine-mediated circRNA-microRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) axis have not been conducted. This study is aim to investigate the functions of fluoxetine and identification of fluoxetine-mediated circRNAs and mRNAs in cerebral ischemic stroke. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat models were successfully established at fisrt, and then rats were intraperitoneally injected with 10-mg\/kg fluoxetine hydrochloride for 14 d. Afterward, the cerebral infarction area was evaluated using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. High-throughput sequencing was adopted to screen the differential circRNAs and mRNAs. The candidate circRNAs, mRNAs, and potential microRNAs were verified using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addtion, microRNA and circRNA binding was verified using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results revealed that fluoxetine markedly diminished the cerebral infarction area in rats after MCAO. The circRNAs and mRNAs were differentially expressed, which includes 879 circRNAs and 815 mRNAs between sham and MCAO groups, respectively, and 958 circRNAs and 838 mRNAs between MCAO and fluoxetine groups, respectively. In which, circMap2k1 and Pidd1 expression was significantly increased in the MCAO group but suppressed after fluoxetine treatment. Moreover, circMap2k1 directly binds with miR-135b-5p. Taken together, we verified that fluoxetine could improve brain injury after cerebral ischemic stroke. Moreover, the circMap2k1\/miR-135b-5p\/Pidd1 axis is potentially involved in cerebral ischemic stroke.","1724":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major public health issue as its progression increases risks of multisystem morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence indicates a more complex relationship between hypertension and NAFLD than previously thought. In this study, a comprehensive literature search was used to gather information supporting the comorbidity phenomenon of hypertension and NAFLD. Then, systems biology approach was applied to identify the potential genes and mechanisms simultaneously associated with hypertension and NAFLD. With the help of protein-protein interaction network-based algorithm, we found that the distance between hypertension and NAFLD was much less than random ones. Sixty-four shared genes of hypertension and NAFLD modules were identified as core genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that some inflammatory, metabolic and endocrine signals were related to the potential biological functions of core genes. More importantly, drugs used to treat cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, inflammatory diseases and depression could be potential therapeutics against hypertension-NAFLD co-occurrence. After analyzing public OMICs data, ALDH1A1 was identified as a potential therapeutic target, without being affected by reverse causality. These findings give a clue for the potential mechanisms of comorbidity of hypertension and NAFLD and highlight the multiple target-therapeutic strategy of NAFLD for future clinical research.","1725":null,"1726":"The present study examined how resveratrol affects cell growth and MAGEA12\/Akt signaling pathway in OSCC cells. Cal-27 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding MAGEA12, and the effects of overexpression were assessed in terms of cell viability, colony formation and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Cal-27 cells and MAGEA12-overexpressing cells were treated with resveratrol, then the cell viability and colony formation were also assessed by CCK8 assay and microscope, respectively. Levels of MAGEA12, p-Akt, Akt, Cyclin D1, and CDK14 genes and these proteins were analyzed using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase-chain reaction and western blot. In the present research, we first generated and transiently transfected MAGEA12 plasmid into Cal-27 cells. Our results suggested that overexpressing MAGEA12 led to an increase in levels of phospho-Akt, which was associated with increased cell viability, colony formation. Moreover, overexpressing MAGEA12 also resulted in the up-regulation of Cyclin D1 and CDK14, indicating MAGEA12 induces the cell proliferation of Cal-27 cells. In addition, these effects were partially reversed by inhibiting Akt. Furthermore, resveratrol could inhibit the proliferation and colony in Cal-27 cells and decrease the expressions of MAGEA12 and p-Akt depending on the time and concentration. These effects were also partially reversed by MAGEA12 overexpression and Akt activation. In summary, resveratrol may suppress the growth of OSCC cells by inactivating MAGEA12\/Akt signaling. These findings suggest that resveratrol may be a therapeutic drug for OSCC in clinical.","1727":"Emerging evidence has exhibited an obvious decreased expression of miR-106a-5p in the ectopic endometrial tissue of endometriosis (EMS) patients. Thus far, the pathophysiological function of miR-106a-5p in EMS is unknown. A previous study showed an increased FOXC1 expression in the ectopic endometrial tissue of patients with EMS. Moreover, we found that there was a binding site of miR-106a-5p on the 3'UTR of FOXC1 through bioinformatics predictions. Hence, we speculated that miR-106a-5p might affect the development of EMS via targeting FOXC1. We first showed a decreased level of miR-106a-5p and an increased level of FOXC1 mRNA in ectopic endometrial tissues compared with normal tissues. Functionally, we transfected ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) with miR-106a-5p mimics or NC mimics and indicated an inhibitory role of miR-106a-5p on ESC proliferation, invasion, and migration. Mechanistically, FOXC1 was found to be a target gene of miR-106a-5p. To confirm whether miR-106a-5p exerted an inhibitory activity in ESCs via targeting FOXC1, miR-106a-5p mimic was co-transfected into ESCs with the FOXC1-plasmid or vector. We found that FOXC1 overexpression evidently reversed the results caused by a miR-106a-5p mimic in ESCs. Additionally, our results demonstrated that miR-106a-5p mimic inhibited the expression of p-Akt and p-PI3K. Collectively, these results revealed that miR-106a-5p inhibited the proliferative, migratory, and invasive ability of ESCs via directly binding to FOXC1, likely through the suppression of the PI3K and its downstream signaling pathway, which offered a potential and novel therapeutic strategy for EMS treatment.","1728":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis, and it is reported that abnormal miR-92a-3p expression participates in multiple cancers' occurrence and progression.

The current study proved miR-92a-3p expression was enhanced in BC tissues and cells, and its high expression was related to increased TNM stage and larger tumor size of BC patients. Functionally, transfection of miR-92a-3p mimics facilitated BC cell proliferation and metastasis, yet transfection of miR-92a-3p inhibitors functioned oppositely. In addition, BTG2 was verified as a direct miR-92a-3p target in BC cells.

The main active ingredients and therapeutic targets of the Xuebijing injection, and the pathogenic targets of COVID-19 were screened using the TCMSP, UniProt, and GeneCard databases. According to the 'Drug-Ingredients-Targets-Disease' network built by STRING and Cytoscape, AKT1 was identified as the core target, and baicalein, luteolin, and quercetin were identified as the active ingredients of the Xuebijing injection in connection with AKT1. R language was used for enrichment analysis that predict the mechanisms by which the Xuebijing injection may inhibit lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammatory response, modulate NOS activity, and regulate the TNF signal pathway by affecting the role of AKT1.

Circulating miRNA sequences and PB expression profiles were obtained from GEO datasets. Ten miRNAs with the most significant differential expression rate (dif-miRNA) were subjected to miRbase to confirm their identity. Dif-miRNA targets were predicted by TargetScan and aligned with differentially expressed genes to obtain overlapping co-genes. Biological functions of co-genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis. Interaction network of dif-miRNAs, co-genes, and their downstream pathways were studied by analyzing protein-protein interaction (PPI) clusters (STRING) and determining the crucial hubs (Cytoscape).MiR-522-3p and miR-134 dif-miRNAs are involved in protein translation and apoptosis by regulating their respective co-genes in PB.

LncRNA ZFPM2 antisense RNA 1 (ZFPM2-AS1) was confirmed to be implicated in numerous tumors, while its biological function and mechanism have not been thoroughly understood in glioma. The gene expression was measured by RT-qPCR. Cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis of glioma cells were validated by CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry and TUNEL assays. The effect of ZFPM2-AS1 on tumor growth was verified by in vivo assay. The exploration on ZFPM2-AS1-mediated mechanism was carried out via ChIP, luciferase reporter, and RIP assays. In the present study, ZFPM2-AS1 was demonstrated as a highly-expressed lncRNA in glioma tissues and cells. ZFPM2-AS1 silencing suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle, but facilitated cell apoptosis. In addition, the inhibitive effect of silenced ZFPM2-AS1 was also observed in tumor growth. Furthermore, we found that SP1 interacted with ZFPM2-AS1 promoter to transcriptionally activate ZFPM2-AS1 expression. Moreover, ZFPM2-AS1 was identified as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-515-5p to target SOD2. Rescue assays verified that SOD2 overexpression partially abolished the suppressive impact of ZFPM2-AS1 silencing on glioma cell growth. In conclusion, this study corroborated the regulatory mechanism of SP1\/ZFPM2-AS1\/miR-515-5p\/SOD2 axis in glioma, indicating that targeting ZFPM2-AS1 might be an effective way to treat glioma.","1735":"Excessive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is implicated in breast cancer (BC) chemoresistance, but its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. There are STAT3 binding sites in fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) promoter region, thus STAT3 may regulate the transcription of FTO. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between FTO and STAT3 in BC chemoresistance. Herein, FTO and STAT3 were highly expressed in doxorubicin-resistant BC (BC-DoxR) cells. CHIP assay verified the binding between STAT3 and FTO promoter in BC-DoxR cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that FTO promoter activity was inhibited by S3I-201 (STAT3 inhibitor) but enhanced by epidermal growth factor (EGF, STAT3 activator) in BC-DoxR and BC cells. FTO mRNA and protein expression were suppressed by S3I-201 in BC-DoxR cells and EGF-stimulated BC cells. Notably, FTO regulated total N6-methyladenosine (m6A) levels in BC-DoxR and BC cells but could not affect STAT3 mRNA expression, indicating that FTO was not involved in the m6A modification of STAT3. However, FTO could activate STAT3 signaling in BC-DoxR and BC cells. Besides, FTO knockdown inhibited the doxorubicin resistance of BC-DoxR cells, while FTO overexpression enhanced the doxorubicin resistance and weakened the doxorubicin sensitivity of BC cells. Moreover, decreased doxorubicin resistance by STAT3 knockdown was abolished by FTO overexpression and decreased doxorubicin sensitivity by STAT3 overexpression was reversed by FTO knockdown, indicating that FTO was implicated in STAT3-mediated doxorubicin resistance and impairment of doxorubicin sensitivity of BC cells. Altogether, our findings provide a mechanism underlying BC doxorubicin resistance.","1736":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNAs generated from back splicing to enhance or inhibit the progression of multiple human cancers including osteosarcoma (OS).

Here, we found that silence of circ_0102049 could significantly exacerbate the tumorigenesis of OS in vivo through sponging microRNA-520g-3p. Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) was predicted to be a target of miR-520g-3p, and luciferase reporter assay revealed that overexpression of miR-520g-3p dramatically suppressed the expression of PLK2, whereas miR-520g-3p inhibitor promoted the PLK2 expression. Moreover, the silence of circ_0102049 could markedly promote the proliferation, invasion, migration and cell-cycle promotion while inhibiting the apoptosis of OS cell line MG63 cells in vitro through regulating miR-520g-3p\/PLK2 axis.

Increasing evidence shows that immunity plays a vital role in the prognosis of CM. In this study, we developed an immune-related gene pair (IRGP) signature to predict the clinical prognosis of patients with CM. Immune-related genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were selected to construct the IRGPs, and patients with CM in these two cohorts were assigned to low- and high-risk subgroups. Moreover, we investigated the IRGPs and their individualized prognostic signatures using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, and analysis of immune cell infiltration in CM. A 41-IRGP signature was constructed from 2498 immune genes that could significantly predict the overall survival of patients with CM in both the TCGA and GEO cohorts. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that several immune cells, especially M1 macrophages and activated CD4 T cells, were significantly associated with the prognostic effect of the IRGP signature in patients with CM. Overall, the IRGP signature constructed in this study was useful for determining the prognosis of patients with CM and for providing further understanding of CM immunotherapy.","1744":null,"1745":"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive inflammatory disease. In clinical treatment, many patients cannot get a timely diagnosis and effective treatment due to the lack of early diagnosis indicators. Mesenchymal stem cells have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and have broad application prospects in treating auto-immune diseases and inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to clarify the mechanisms of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs) in the treatment of CP. The rats were randomly divided into four groups, with six rats in each group: control group, CP group, CP + HUCMSCs-treated group I, and CP + HUCMSCs-treated group II. We evaluated the levels of inflammatory factors, fibrosis and apoptosis markers, detected the protein expression levels of AKT-mTOR-S6K1 and assessed histological changes of the pancreas. The results showed that HUCMSCs not only inhibited the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and activation of pancreatic stellate cells but also suppressed the apoptosis of acinar cells. Further investigation revealed that HUCMSCs noticeably suppressed the AKT-mTOR-S6K1 pathway in the pancreatic tissue of DBTC-induced CP. In addition, the therapeutic effect of HUCMSCs injected into the inferior vena cava and left gastric artery in the CP model was also observed, thus providing the basis for the clinical application of intervention measures.","1746":"APOBEC3 (A3) cytidine deaminases inhibit hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and play vital roles in maintaining a variety of biochemical processes, including the regulation of protein expression and innate immunity. Emerging evidence indicates that the deaminated deoxycytidine biochemical activity of A3 proteins in single-stranded DNA makes them a double-edged sword. These enzymes can cause cellular genetic mutations at replication forks or within transcription bubbles, depending on the physiological state of the cell and the phase of the cell cycle. Under pathological conditions, aberrant expression of A3 genes with improper deaminase activity regulation may threaten genomic stability and eventually lead to cancer development. This review attempted to summarize the antiviral activities and underlying mechanisms of A3 editing enzymes in HBV infections. Moreover, the correlations between A3 genes and hepatocarcinogenesis were also elucidated.","1747":null,"1748":null,"1749":null,"1750":"Long noncoding RNA (lnc RNA) is aberrant expressed in many kinds of tumors and may be concerned with the occurrence and progression of tumors.

We aimed to investigate whether HOXA5 could bind to AKR1B10 to regulate ACC cells proliferation and apoptosis. The expression of AKR1B10 and HOXA5 in ACC patients and the relationship of their expression between ACC prognosis were evaluated by searching database. Then, NCI-H295R cells were overexpressed to detect the alteration of cell proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of p53 and p21 proteins. The interaction between AKR1B10 and HOXA5 was validated by luciferase report and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally, NCI-H295R cells were silenced with HOXA5 in the presence of AKR1B10 overexpression, and then cell proliferation and apoptosis were also assessed. Results revealed that AKR1B10 and HOXA5 are down-regulated in ACC patients and the low expression of it is correlated with low percent of overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). Compared with Y1 cells, SW-13 and NCI-H295R cells exerted lower expression of AKR1B10 and HOXA5. AKR1B10 significantly inhibited cell viability, colony formation and expression of Ki67 and PCNA, but promoted apoptosis and expression of p53 and p21 in NCI-H295R cells. HOXA5 could interact with AKR1B10 and enhance AKR1B10 expression. Furthermore, HOXA5 knockdown obviously blocked the effect of AKR1B10 overexpression on NCI-H295R cells proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion, HOXA5 could bind to AKR1B10 promotor to increase its expression, activate p53 signaling, thereby inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis of ACC cells.","1753":"Colorectal cancer lymph node metastasis, which is highly associated with the patient's cancer recurrence and survival rate, has been the focus of many therapeutic strategies that are highly associated with the patient's cancer recurrence and survival rate. The popular methods for classification of lymph node metastasis by neural networks, however, show limitations as the available low-level features are inadequate for classification, and the radiologists are unable to quickly review the images. Identifying lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer is a key factor in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer. In the present work, an automatic classification method based on deep transfer learning was proposed. Specifically, the method resolved the problem of repetition of low-level features and combined these features with high-level features into a new feature map for classification; and a merged layer which merges all transmitted features from previous layers into a map of the first full connection layer. With a dataset collected from Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, the experiment involved a sample of 3,364 patients. Among these samples, 1,646 were positive, and 1,718 were negative. The experiment results showed the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.8732, 0.8746, 0.8746 and 0.8728, respectively, and the accuracy and AUC were 0.8358 and 0.8569, respectively. These demonstrated that our method significantly outperformed the previous classification methods for colorectal cancer lymph node metastasis without increasing the depth and width of the model.","1754":null,"1755":null,"1756":null,"1757":"Circular RNA (circRNA) features prominently in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), of which the biological function and potential mechanism of circ_0008274 in HCC are obscure.

The LPS-induced ALI model of MRC-5 cells was first established, and the expression profiles of circRNAs and mRNAs in LPS-induced MRC-5 cells were confirmed through RNA sequencing analysis. Gene Ontologyanalysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were also applied to predict the latent functions and pathways of the differential mRNAs. After hsa_circ_0059930 knockdown, the proliferation and apoptosis of MRC-5 cells were identified by CCK-8, flow cytometer, and western blot assays. And we predicted the network analysis of hsa_circ_0059930. We testified that LPS could markedly prevent proliferation and induce apoptosis of MRC-5 cells. We discovered a total of 820 differential circRNAs (560 upregulated and 260 downregulated circRNAs) and 484 differential mRNAs (240 upregulated and 244 downregulated mRNAs) in LPS-induced MRC-5 cells. Besides, hsa_circ_0059930 was identified to be significantly upregulated in LPS-induced MRC-5 cells, and knockdown of hsa_circ-0059930 could notably accelerate proliferation and suppress apoptosis of LPS-mediated MRC-5 cells.

Immune system evasion, one hallmark of cancer, contributes to cancer cells in escaping from the attack of immune cells. In order to identify potential prognostic biomarkers in ccRCC patients and immune cells fraction, we collected and downloaded profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We obtained 2 modules significantly associated with tumor stage and immune cells; functional enrichment analysis showed that genes in the module 'yellow' were significantly enriched in proteins targeting to membrane and ribosome, as well as the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, while genes in the module 'green' mainly participate in molecular functions associated with immunity like activation of T cells. Four LncRNAs (LINC00472, AL590094.1, AL365203.3, and AC147651.3) and RPL27A and RPL22L1 in the module 'yellow' and two lncRNAs (LINC00426 and AC129507.2) and five protein-coding genes (CSF1, NOD2, ITGAE, CD7, and PDCD1) in the module 'green' represented independent prognostic values in patients with ccRCC. Expression of LINC0042, NOD2, CD7, and PDCD1 were significantly correlated with ratio of immune cells (like T cells CD8 and resting mast cells).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as reported, are implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, but how miRNAs-146a-5p (miR-146a-5p) works in asthma remains inconclusive. In this work, we proved that miR-146a-5p expression was inhibited in asthma patients' plasma and platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced human small airway epithelial cells (HSAECs). MiR-146a-5p up-regulation ameliorated the inflammatory reaction and cell barrier damage of HSAECs induced by PAF, and inhibited the apoptosis; besides, miR-146a-5p down-regulation functioned oppositely. In addition, miR-146a-5p could target TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and negatively regulate its expression. TRAF6 overexpression could counterract the impact of miR-146a-5p up-regulation on PAF-induced inflammation, cell barrier damage and apoptosis of HSAECs. Collectively, miR-146a-5p may protect airway epithelial cells and inhibit the pathogenesis of asthma via targeting TRAF6.","1762":"Testicular cancer is the most common malignant tumor in young men, and its incidence has increased in recent years. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development and progression of tumors; however, the TME of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) is poorly understood. In this study, we downloaded information for 156 TGCT cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, used the ESTIMATE method to determine immune and stromal scores, and used CIBERSORT to calculate the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs). The differentially expressed genes were subjected to a COX regression analysis and used for the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was identified as a predictive marker by combining the results of the Cox regression analysis and PPI network. A survival analysis showed that TLR2 was positively correlated with TGCT survival. A gene set enrichment analysis indicated that genes in the high TLR2 expression group were enriched for cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and the chemokine signaling pathway, and genes in the low TLR2 expression group were mainly enriched in the spliceosome. Regarding proportions of TICs, naive B cells and follicular helper T cells were negatively correlated with the expression of TLR2. This suggests that as TLR2 expression increases, the immunocompetence of the TME decreases. The expression of TLR2 may affect the prognosis of TGCT, suggesting that this locus can be used as a prognostic factor for TGCT.","1763":"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is the most common malignant endocrine tumors which resist to majority treatment.

Viabilities and apoptosis were tested by CCK-8, colony formation and flow cytometry. The interactions between miR-155-5p and AFAP-AS1 or ETS1 was detected by luciferase reporter assays. ETS proto-oncogene1\/mitogen-activated protein kinase1 (ETS1\/ERK) pathway was assessed by Western blot. Xenograft models were built to confirm the function of AFAP-AS1 in vivo. Firstly, we showed that relative RNA expression of AFAP-AS1 in ATC cells was higher than in immortalized thyroid cells. Next, AFAP-AS1 was verified as an oncogene in ATC since knock-down of AFAP-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation and accelerated apoptosis. In addition, miR-155-5p was negatively regulated by AFAP-AS1. Moreover, AFAP-AS1 regulated ETS1\/ERK pathway by sponging miR-155-5p. Finally, we confirmed knock-down of AFAP-AS1 significantly suppressed tumor proliferation in vivo.

LncBase online database predicted that miR-141-3p could be a putative target of INHBA-AS1, and the interaction of them was verified by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Subsequently, following INHBA-AS1 silencing, cell proliferation and migration were evaluated using CCK-8, wound healing and Transwell assays. And rescue experiments were conducted to analyze the impact of INHBA-AS1 and miR-141-3p on HS formation. Immunofluorescence assay was employed to examine the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins. Then, StarBase database predicated that myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) was a potential target of miR-141-3p, which was verified with luciferase reporter- and RIP assays. Finally, cell function and ECM deposition were determined after MCL1-downregulation. INHBA-AS1 was significantly elevated while miR-141-3p was notably reduced in hHSFs. And it was confirmed that miR-141-3p was directly targeted by INHBA-AS1. Moreover, INHBA-AS1 silencing markedly attenuated the proliferation, migration and ECM accumulation of hHSFs, which were restored after miR-141-3p silencing. Additionally, MCL1 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-141-3p, and MCL1-knockdown remarkably alleviated the proliferation, migration and ECM accumulation of hHSFs.

Next, by performing the gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we expectedly found that LINC00649 acted as an oncogene to accelerate GC cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and promote its tumorigenesis in vivo. Moreover, the online miRDB software predicted that miR-16-5p bound to both LINC00649 and 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of YAP1 mRNA, which were validated by the following dual-luciferase reporter gene system assay and RNA pull-down assay. Finally, we proved that LINC00649 exerted its tumor-promoting effects in GC by regulating the miR-16-5p\/YES-associated protein 1 (YAP1)\/Hippo pathway. Mechanistically, knock-down of LINC00649 suppressed YAP1 expressions by releasing miR-16-5p, resulting in the recovery of the Hippo pathway, which suppressed the expression levels of the downstream oncogenes, including EGFR, SOX2 and OCT4, leading to the inhibition of the malignant phenotypes in GC cells. In conclusion, this study, for the first time, evidenced that LINC00649 promoted GC progression by targeting the miR-16-5p\/YAP1\/Hippo signaling pathway, which provided potential diagnostic and therapeutic indicators for GC treatment for clinical utilization.","1770":null,"1771":null,"1772":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumors, ranking second in the global cause of death from cancer.

The cluster-1 genes obtained by Cytoscape were analyzed by GEPIA for expression and overall survival in HCC and, finally, introduced target genes to DGIdb to get associated drugs. A total of 199 genes were found to be in common between HCC and depression. GO term enrichment analysis on DAVID found the top-6 biological processes to be mainly associated with cell death and apoptosis. The top-6 cellular component terms are extracellular. The top-6 of molecular function terms are mainly associated with receptor binding. The top-6 pathways enriched by KEGG are mainly related to inflammatory response.

Rigorous screening conditions were assigned to the screening of hub genes, which were then used to generate the GIRI through multivariate Cox regression analysis. The selected samples were assigned to the high-risk group or the low-risk group based on the median GIRI. Possible reasons for the prognostic differences in risk subgroups were explored from the aspects of mutation profiles, immune profiles, immunomodulators, and biological pathway activities. The possibility of immunotherapy response was predicted by Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion analysis results. The prediction of drugs that might reverse the expression profiles of the risk subgroups was discovered through theonnectivity Map (CMap). High-risk populations manifested poor overall survival than low-risk populations and were characterized by elevated cumulative mutation counts and tumor mutation burden. Also, high-risk populations had higher immune scores, immunomodulator (PD-1, CTLA4, LAG3, and TIGIT) expression, and genomic instability-related pathway activities, and were more likely to reap benefits from immunotherapy. Besides, we predicted several drugs (PI3K inhibitor, ATPase inhibitor, and phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase inhibitor) targeting risk subgroups.

Stromal and immune cell scores were calculated using the ESTIMATE method, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined. We identified 830 DEGs, which were further subjected to survival analyses and functional enrichment analysis. Next, we identified prognostic TME-associated DEGs, established a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and performed Cox analysis.Consequently, four key prognostic genes (CXCL5, CXCL8, IL18RAP, and TREM2) associated with TME, were identified, in which CXCL5 and IL18RAP may be potential independent prognostic factors. Age, clinical stage, N stage, and risk score were also determined as significant prognostic variables. CIBERSORT was used to predict the constitution and relative content of the immune cells, wherein M0 macrophages were the most closely related to the key genes. In conclusion, CXCL5, CXCL8, IL18RAP, and TREM2 were associated with HCC prognosis and were important for immune cell invasion into the TME.

Accordingly, its incidence and mortality are high. One of the characteristics of cancer is genomic instability. New studies suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in maintaining genomic instability. This study aimed to identify a genomic instability-associated lncRNA signature to predict the outcome of patients with bladder cancer. We downloaded data for bladder cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to obtain lncRNA expression profiles as well as somatic mutation profiles. Using the lncRNA computational framework, a genomic instability-related lncRNA signature (GIlncSig) was established and the prognostic value of this signature was assessed and validated. A five-lncRNA signature based on genomic instability (CFAP58-DT, MIR100HG, LINC02446, AC078880.3, and LINC01833) was obtained from 58 differentially expressed lncRNAs. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group having a substantially worse prognosis than the low-risk group. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses indicated that GIlncSig may be an independent prognostic factor; this finding was subsequently validated. In addition, enrichment analysis indicated that GIlncSig is associated with genomic instability in bladder cancer. GIlncSig has a predictive value for the prognosis of bladder cancer patients and provides guidance for the clinical treatment of these patients.","1778":"We aimed to illustrate the influence of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and immune cell infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The relationship of lncRNAs and m6A was identified through gene expression analysis using PERL and R packages. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes gene expression enrichment analysis was performed via gene set enrichment analysis. Lasso regression was utilized to construct prognostic model. Differences in the tumor microenvironment and the immune correlation were analyzed to clarify immune cell infiltration in different clusters and their correlation with the clinical prognosis. Co-expression analysis showed that lncRNA expression was associated closely with m6A. Many lncRNAs were predictive risk factors of prognosis in HCC. m6A-lncRNAs were partially highly expressed in tumor tissue and could be used in a prognostic model to predict HCC prognosis, independent of other clinical characteristics. 'NOTCH SIGNALING PATHWAY' was most significantly enriched according to GSEA. CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing member 3 (CMTM3) was overexpressed in tumor tissue. Immune cells, such as activated CD4 memory T cells, CD8 T cells, and follicular helper T cells, highly infiltrated tissues in cluster 2. All related scores were higher in cluster 2, indicating a lower purity of tumor cells and higher density of immune-related cells in the tumor microenvironment. m6A-lncRNAs are closely related to HCC occurrence and progression.

Furthermore, neuroepithelial cell transforming 1 (NET1) functioned as a miR-340-5p target, and acted in a baicalin-dependent manner to regulate lung cancer progression. Thus, baicalin elicited antitumor activities by affecting the miR-340-5p\/NET1 axis, suggesting a new approach to lung cancer clinical management.","1780":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of mortality in cancer patients, but the association between miR-125b-2-3p and the onset and prognosis of HCC has not been reported in previous studies; thus, the clinicopathological implications of miR-125b-2-3p in HCC require elaboration. To examine the expression of miR-125b-2-3p in HCC, both in-house RT-qPCR and public datasets were used to calculate the standard mean difference (SMD) and the summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC). MiR-125b-2-3p was markedly lower in HCC than in non-tumor tissue as assessed by the in-house RT-qPCR which was confirmed by the integrative analysis showing the SMD being -0.69 and the area under the curve (AUC) being 0.84 based on 1,233 cases of HCC and 630 cases of non-HCC controls. To gain a overview of the clinical value of miR-125b-2-3p in HCC, all possible datasets were integrated, and lower miR-125b-2-3p levels could lead to poorer differentiation and a more advanced clinical stage of HCC. The hazard ratio (HR) of miR-125b-2-3p was also calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model, and the miR-125b-2-3p level could act as an protective indication for the survival with the HR being 0.74 based on 586 cases of HCC. Furthermore, the effect of nitidine chloride (NC), a natural bioactive phytochemical alkaloid, on the regulation of miR-125b-2-3p and its potential targets was also investigated. The miR-125b-2-3p level was increased after NC treatment, while the expression of its potential target PRKCA was reduced. Above all, a low-expressed level of miR-125b-2-3p plays a tumor suppressive role in HCC.","1781":null,"1782":"Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive malignant tumor with a high rate of lung metastasis and a lack of therapeutic targets. Although the anomalous expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been extensively documented in human cancer, its contribution to OS metastasis remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that MIR205 host gene (MIR205HG) was significantly elevated in human OS tissues, especially in metastatic OS tissues. Stable knockdown of MIR205HG inhibited OS cell invasion and lung metastatic foci formation, but did not affect cell viability. The vast majority of MIR205HG was situated in the cytosol, and served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that directly bound to microRNA 2114-3p (miR-2114-3p), resulting in increased twist family bHLH transcription factor 2 (TWIST2) level. Pre-clinically, high MIR205HG was linked with dismal overall and relapse-free survival. Functionally, the attenuated cell invasion caused by MIR205HG knockdown was effectively rescued by miR-2114-3p silencing or TWIST2 overexpression. Overall, our findings suggest that the previously uncharacterized regulatory axis of MIR205HG\/miR-2114-3p\/TWIST2 plays a critical role in promoting OS metastasis, which implies a potential therapeutic target in OS patients with metastasis.","1783":null,"1784":"Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignancy of plasma cells mainly derived from the bone marrow, has remained incurable generally. LncRNA MALAT1 has been reported to be upregulated in the MM cells and knockdown of MALAT1 inhibited MM cell cycle progression and enhanced cell apoptosis. Online target prediction showed that two target sites for MALAT1 existed in miR-188-5p, which has been identified as a tumor suppressor in other types of cancers. However, the role of miR-188-5p in the MM and whether miR-188-5p mediates the MM tumor progression regulated by MALAT1 are still unknown. Herein, four main MM cell lines were adopted to investigate the effects of miR-188-5p on cell proliferation and apoptosis via transfection with miR-188-5p mimic\/inhibitor and co-transfection with miR-188-5p inhibitor and MALAT1-shRNA plasmids. Xenograft tumor model was also established to study these effects in vivo. Overexpression of miR-188-5p inhibited cell viability, cell proliferation as well as tumor growth and arrested cell cycle at G1 to S transition, but miR-188-5p knockdown showed opposite effects on the MM cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MALAT1 was shown to be inversely correlated with miR-188-5p expression through direct binding to miR-188-5p, and in turn, miR-188-5p could mediate the MM cell proliferation and apoptosis regulated by MALAT1. These findings indicate that miR-188-5p serves as a tumor suppressor in the progression of the MM and is directly involved in MM cell proliferation and apoptosis regulated by MALAT1, which may provide a potential therapeutic target or prognostic indictor for MM clinical treatment.","1785":"As a common muscle relaxant, cisatracurium has shown good antitumor effect on some tumors. Recent studies reported that cisatracurium could inhibit the progression of colon cancer by upregulating tumor suppressor gene p53. However, its role in ovarian cancer and its regulatory effect on p53 and p53 downstream targeting gene long intergenic noncoding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) is still unknown. Quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to assess the expression of p53, lincRNA-p21 and miR-181b. Cell viability and proliferation were detected by CCK-8 assay and Edu staining, respectively. Wound-healing and Transwell assays were performed to determine the abilities of cell migration and invasion. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to detect the relationship between lincRNA-p21 and miR-181b. As a result, cisatracurium could increase the expressions of p53 and lincRNA-p21 of ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR-3) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, cisatracurium significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of OVACR-3 cells, and induced apoptosis. However, these above changes in biological function can be attenuated by lincRNA-p21 knockdown. Next, lincRNA-p21 could directly target miR-181b and negatively regulate its expression by luciferase reporter assay. In conclusion, cisatracurium inhibited the progression of OVCAR-3 cells through upregulation of lincRNA-p21 expression activated by p53 inhibiting miR-181b expression. The experimental results provide a new research idea for the application of cisatracurium in ovarian cancer.","1786":null,"1787":"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is oncogenic in multiple cancers. Herein, the present study is aimed at delving into how XIST functions in retinoblastoma (RB) and investigating its underlying mechanism. In this study, XIST, miR-191-5p, BDNF mRNA, and BDNF expression levels in RB tissues or cell lines were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or Western blot. The models of gain-of-function and loss-of-function were established by the transfection of pcDNA3.1-XIST, XIST siRNA, and miR-191-5p mimics and inhibitors into SO-Rb50 and Y79 cells, respectively. RB cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were detected employing cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferased UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. The regulatory relationships among XIST, miR-191-5p, and BDNF were affirmed utilizing bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, as well as Western blot. We reported that, XIST expression was markedly elevated in RB tissue and RB cells. XIST overexpression accelerated RB cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and attenuated RB cell apoptosis but miR-191-5p exerted the opposite effects. Besides, BDNF expression was inhibited by miR-191-5p in both mRNA and protein levels. XIST indirectly improved BDNF expression by repressing miR-191-5p expression as a competitive endogenous RNA. In conclusion, XIST expression is abnormally elevated in RB tissues and XIST can modulate proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of RB cells by regulating miR-191-5p\/BDNF axis.","1788":null,"1789":"Reportedly, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2T (UBE2T) is closely related to the progression of several malignancies. This work is aimed to probe the role of UBE2T in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The microarray analysis was executed to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCC tissues. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA2) databases, PCR and immunohistochemistry were utilized to validate the dysregulation of UBE2T in HCC. Kaplan-Meier analysis was employed to determine the relationship between UBE2T expression and the prognosis of HCC patients. PCR was carried out to detect UBE2T protein expression in HCC cell lines. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) experiments were conducted to examine the proliferation of HCC cells. Scratch healing and Transwell experiments were conducted to examine the migration of HCC cells. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter gene experiments predicted and validated the targeting relationship with miR-212-5p and UBE2T. We found that UBE2T expression was remarkably up-modulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and its high expression was linked to a worse prognosis in HCC patients. UBE2T overexpression enhanced HCC cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, UBE2T was verified as a downstream target of miR-212-5p. In conclusion, UBE2T overexpression is markedly linked to unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients. UBE2T, regulated by miR-212-5p, significantly enhances the malignant phenotypes of HCC cells, which can be used as a target for HCC diagnosis and prognosis.","1790":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) feature prominently in regulating the progression of tumors, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This work is designated to delve into the role of circ_0062389 in PTC. Generally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to detect circ_0062389, miR-1179 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) mRNA expression levels. RNase R assay was used to verify the circular characteristics of circ_0062389. After circ_0062389 was knocked down in PTC cells, CCK-8 assay was adopted to determine cell viability. Wound healing assay was leveraged to probe cell migration. Besides, Western blot assay was executed to examine the expression levels of HMGB1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT)-related markers (E-cadherin and N-cadherin). Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to authenticate the targeting relationships between miR-1179 and circ_0062389, as well as miR-1179 and HMGB1. Here, this work proved that circ_0062389 was greatly up-regulated in PTC tissues and cell lines. The high expression of circ_0062389 was related to large tumor size and positive lymphatic metastasis. Knocking down circ_0062389 could inhibit the proliferation, migration and EMT process of PTC cells. Besides, miR-1179 was a downstream molecule of circ_0062389. Furthermore, miR-1179 inhibitors could partially reverse the above effect of knocking down circ_0062389 on PTC cells. It was also confirmed that HMGB1 was a direct target of miR-1179 and mediated the effects of circ_0062389 and miR-1179 in PTC. Altogether, circ_0062389 can adsorb miR-1179, and regulate HMGB1 expression, thus playing a role in PTC.","1791":"This study aimed to investigate the implication of REDD1 on airborne particle matter-induced lung injury and whether it is mediated through autophagy. Cell viability in BEAS-2B cells induced by PM2.5 was measured by CCK-8. RT-qPCR and Western blot were performed to determine mRNA and protein levels of REDD1 as well as inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Cell apoptosis was observed with TUNEL staining. The expression of autophagy-related genes was detected by Western blot. Autophagy level was observed with GFP-LC3 staining. PM2.5 induced the expression of REDD1 in BEAS-2B cells. The inhibition by silencing REDD1 ameliorated the viability damage, blocked the inflammatory response and reduced the number of apoptotic BEAS-2B cells all induced by PM2.5. It was also found that PM2.5 induced autophagy in BEAS-2B cells, which was reversed by interference with REDD1. Furthermore, interference with REDD1 alleviated PM2.5-induced cell damage, inflammatory response and apoptosis in BEAS-2B cells through inhibiting autophagy. REDD1\/autophagy inhibition ameliorates PM2.5-induced viability damage, inflammation and apoptosis in BEAS-2B cells.","1792":null,"1793":"The current study aimed to investigate the effects of sodium butyrate on the level of colonic protein IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) models as well as revealing the relationship between IRAKI level and visceral sensitivity during the progression of IBS. IBS symptoms were induced using TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid) in mice and using IL-33 in HT-29 cells, which were then hanlded with sodium butyrate (100 mM for each mice and 0.05 M for HT-29 cells). The threshold of visceral pain and the expression of IRAKI in mice, and the level of IRAKI in HT-29 cells were detected. The data showed that the level of IRAK1 in IBS mice was higher than that in the control group, while the pre-treatment with sodium butyrate could solidy suppressed the level of IRAK1. Morevoer, it was found that the level of IRAK1 was negatively correlated with the pain threshold. In in vitro assays, the level of IRAK1 was firstly induced by IL-33 stimulation and then suppressed by sodium butyrate pretreatment. Collectively, the level of IRAKI showed an obvioulty positive relation with visceral hypersensitivity in IBS models, and the treatment with sodium butyrate could alleviate visceral hypersensitivity by inhibiting the expression of IRAKI.","1794":null,"1795":null,"1796":"Rab18 and V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing 4 (VSIG4) were reportedly implicated in the malignant progression of glioma.

The proliferation and apoptosis of U87-MG and U251-MG were detected after Rab18 silencing through CCK8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The interaction between Rab18 and VSIG4 was predicted through database and verified by immunoprecipitation assay. The suspicion that whether the sensitivity of glioma to temozolomide was affected by the Rab18-VSIG4 interaction was explored through CCK8 assay. We observed decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis and TMZ sensitivity in U87-MG and U251-MG treated by siRNA-Rab18. Not only was the interaction predicted using database, but also it was confirmed by IP assay. Intriguingly, VSIG4 overexpression effectively reversed above biological process and TMZ sensitivity caused by Rab18 silencing.

Previous studies demonstrated the power of gene expression profiling to reveal pathological changes associated with sepsis-induced ARDS. However, there is still a lack of systematic data mining framework for identifying potential targets for treatment. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of druggable targets prediction based on gene expression data. Through the functional enrichment analysis of microarray-based expression profiles between sepsis-induced ARDS and non-sepsis ARDS samples, we revealed genes involved in anti-microbial infection immunity were significantly altered in sepsis-induced ARDS. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis highlighted TOP2A gene as the key regulator in the dysregulated gene network of sepsis-induced ARDS. We were also able to predict several therapeutic drug candidates for sepsis-induced ARDS using Connectivity Map (Cmap) database, among which doxorubicin was identified to interact with TOP2A with a high affinity similar to its endogenous ligand. Overall, our findings suggest that doxorubicin could be a potential therapeutic for sepsis-induced ARDS by targeting TOP2A, which requires further investigation and validation. The whole study relies on publicly available dataset and publicly accessible database or bioinformatic tools for data mining. Therefore, our study benchmarks a workflow for druggable target prediction which can be widely applicable in the search of targets in other pathological conditions.","1799":"In our previous studies, we discovered the congenital cold syndrome (CCS), which is characterized by 'qi deficiency and qi stagnation, mixed cold and heat.' And there is a type of syndrome with special incidence characteristic. However, the diagnosis of CCS still lacks an objective basis. In this study, we performed Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) based on quantitative proteomics technology to screen the significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in serum of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with CCS, patients with heart and kidney yang deficiency, and healthy people. A total of 22 DEPs (nine upregulated and 13 downregulated) were identified between patients with CCS and healthy subjects. Next, we performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, we found the primary functions of DEPs of CCS were binding, catalytic activity, and molecular function regulator. These DEPs were mainly involved in important biological processes, such as cellular process, response to stimulus, localization, metabolic process, and biological regulation. The KEGG analysis revealed that the DEPs showed significant changes in fructose and mannose metabolism, Pentose phosphate pathway, and Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. After parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) verification, four upregulated target proteins (ALDOA, PCYOX1, Crisp3 and IGLV4-69) and three downregulated proteins (ALDOC, ADAMTSL-2 and C3) were accurately identified. These proteins were mainly related to immune response and glucose metabolism. These DEPs could be the marker proteins of coronary heart disease with CCS. This findings help to reveal the pathogenesis of CHD with CCS and provide potential therapeutic targets.","1800":"Osteoporosis (OP) characterizes a decrease in bone density and bone mass which leads to brittle fractures and serious damages to individuals. In recent years, various researches have proved that miRNAs act pivotally in the onset of bone-related diseases. In our research, we probed into the impact of miR-181a-5P on viability, differentiation, as well as apoptosis of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Our study reported that overexpressing miR-181a-5p considerably reduced the cell growth, whereas the miR-181a-5p inhibition showed opposite results. Furthermore, the hBMSCs apoptosis percentage was visually elevated or minimized after overexpressing or silencing miR-181a-5p, respectively. Our data also indicated that miR-181a-5p overexpression significantly inhibited ALP activity, and level of OPN, Runx2 and OCN at mRNA and protein level, whereas miR-181a-5p inhibition presented opposite results. In addition, based on luciferase reporter assay, sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) was confirmed as the target of miR-181a-5p in hBMSCs. Finally, Sirt1 overexpression significantly inhibited the impact of miR-181a-5p mimic on apoptosis and inhibited differentiation, while silencing Sirt1 eliminated the inhibitory effects of miR-181a-5p on apoptosis and promoted differentiation via PI3K\/AKT pathway.

All the seven recipients were routinely prescribed with PJP prophylaxis after renal transplantation, and six of them suffered acute graft rejection before the infection. P. jirovecii sequence was identified in blood or broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by the metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in all patients. All the patients were improved with the therapy trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) combined with caspofungin for the PJP treatment, but suffered with complications including renal insufficiency, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, mediastinalemphysema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hemophagocytic syndrome and other severe infections. Taken together, mNGS is a powerful tool that could be used to diagnose PJP in renal transplantation recipients. And PJP prophylaxis should be prescribed during and after treatment for acute rejection. TMP-SMX is the first-line and effective drug for PJP treatment, but the complications are always life-threatening and lead to poor prognosis.

GSEA showed that hallmark_kras_signaling_dn, hallmark_myogenesis, and hallmark_epithelial_mesenchymal_transition pathways were enriched in the CDKN2A gene hypermethylation phenotype. Taken together, the low methylation of CDKN2A gene, cg03079681, cg04026675, cg07562918, and cg13601799 locus indicated a better prognosis in GC. The methylation levels of cg14069088 were most negatively correlated with CDKN2A gene expression.

DNA methylation, a major epigenetic phenomenon, is closely related to the pathogenesis of cancer. Neuronal pentraxin II (NPTX2) has been found to be hypermethylated in several cancers such as glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer. However, the roles of NPTX2 in gastric cancer have not been reported. To explore this issue, NPTX2 expression in gastric cancer cells was assessed by western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The methylation analysis of NPTX2 was performed by qRT-PCR as well as methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR). The effects of NPTX2 on gastric cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by colony formation, CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The interaction of NPTX2 with the p53 signaling pathway was evaluated by western blot. Our study found the down-regulated expression of NPTX2 in gastric cancer cells compared with human gastric mucosal cells. In addition, the hypermethylation of NPTX2 was observed in gastric cancer cells, which was correlated with the low expression of NPTX2. Moreover, NPTX2 inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, NPTX2 enhanced the protein expression of p53, p21 and PTEN to activate the p53 signaling pathway. Therefore, NPTX2 hypermethylation caused the downregulation of NPTX2 expression, which could promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and cause cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells by suppressing the p53 signaling pathway. Therefore, NPTX2 may be crucial for the progression of gastric cancer.","1805":"Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a kind of obligate anaerobic gram-positive Bacillus related with intestinal diseases and antibiotic treatment.

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in glycated human serum albumin (M-HSA) were detected by ELISA. The viability of HUVECs was examined by CCK-8 assay. Flow cytometry was performed to detect cell apoptosis, followed by ELISA for the detection of inflammatory cytokine level and oxidative stress level in HUVECs. Immunofluorescence was performed to detect ET-1 and eNOS expression. The expression of specific proteins was assayed by western blot. As a result, decreased HUVEC viability was observed after stimulation with M-HSA, whereas RAGE inhibitor improved it. Cell apoptosis showed the opposite trend. Additionally, M-HSA-induced inflammatory cytokine release and oxidative stress of HUVECs were both alleviated by RAGE inhibitor. RAGE inhibitor also increased the levels of NO and eNOS while decreasing the level of ET-1 in M-HSA-stimulated HUVECs. Furthermore, decreased protein expression of Bax, cleaved-caspase3, RAGE, p65, ET-1 and iNOS was observed after treatment with RAGE inhibitor, in addition to increased protein expression of Bcl-2 and eNOS.

LPS resulted in a decrease in the cell viability and proliferation of HUVECs and HPMECs and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, while BBR treatment resulted in an increase in cell viability and proliferation, as well as a decrease in cell apoptosis. Furthermore, BBR could inhibit LPS-induced autophagy, as demonstrated by its inhibitory effects on the LC3-II\/LC3-I ratio and Beclin-1 levels and its promotive effect on p62 expression. Addition of the autophagy inducer rapamycin (RAPA) aggravated LPS-induced injury, while treatment with the autophagy blocker 3-methyladenine (3-MA) attenuated the injury. Further, the protective effect of BBR was inhibited by rapamycin. JNK inhibition by SP600125 inhibited LPS-induced autophagy, and BBR could not alter the LPS-induced autophagy in HUVECs and HPMECs that were pretreated with SP600125. The present data indicate that BBR attenuated LPS-induced cell apoptosis by blocking JNK-mediated autophagy in HUVECs and HPMECs.

In this study, we identified a set of immune-related biomarkers for prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma, which could provide new ideas for immunotherapy of lung adenocarcinoma. Datasets related to LUAD were filtered from the GEO database. The appropriate packages were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to carry out enrichment analysis, followed by the construction of prognostic biomarkers. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves were plotted to analyze patient survival based on hub genes. Associations between the expression of selected biomarkers and six types of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were evaluated based on the online tool TIMER.

This health threat has already caused over two million deaths worldwide in the span of a year and its mortality rate is projected to continue rising. In this review, the potential of algae in combating the spread of COVID-19 is investigated since algal compounds have been tested against viruses and algal anti-inflammatory compounds have the potential to treat the severe symptoms of COVID-19. The possible utilization of algae in producing value-added products such as serological test kits, vaccines, and supplements that would either mitigate or hinder the continued health risks caused by the virus is prominent. Many of the characteristics in algae can provide insights on the development of microalgae to fight against SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses and contribute in manufacturing various green and high-value products.","1811":null,"1812":"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) refers to a group of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Bushen Yijing decoction (BSYJ) is used for treating SSc. However, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate potential roles of Friend leukemia integration factor 1 (FLI1) and microRNA in the beneficial effects of BSYJ on SSc. Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from healthy individuals and SSc patients through tissue-explant technique and validated by immunocytochemistry. mRNA and microRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Protein expression was measured by western blotting. MiR-26a mimics or inhibitor were transfected to induce miR-26a overexpression or knockdown in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Histological changes of skin tissues from SSc mouse were evaluated by H&amp;E and Masson trichrome staining. Results showed that FLI1 expression significantly decreased in primary skin fibroblasts of SSc patients. MiR-26a was predicted to target FLI1 untranslated region. Transfection of miR-26 mimics in SSc skin fibroblasts (SFB) leads to decrease in FLI1 expression and increase in collagen I gene expression and fibronectin accumulation. On the other hand, miR-26a knockdown increased FLI1 expression and decreased collagen I and fibronectin expression in SFB. In addition, BSYJ-containing rat serum suppressed miR-26a expression, while it elevated FLI1 expression and inhibited fibronectin and collagen I accumulation in SFB. In the mouse SSc model, BSYJ-containing serum inhibited dermal fibrosis by suppressing miR-26a expression and restoring FLI1 protein levels. Overall, our study demonstrates that BSYJ decoction exerts anti-dermal fibrosis in SSc patients via suppressing miR-26a level and thus to increase FLI1 expression in fibroblasts.","1813":"RNA-binding motif protein 25 (RBM25) is a poorly characterized RNA-binding protein that is involved in several biological processes and regulates the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. The regulatory role of RBM25 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. Here, RBM25 expression and outcomes in HCC patients were evaluated using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. RBM25 was overexpressed in HCC patients compared with the healthy group. The high expression of RBM25 in tumor tissues was significantly related to poor overall survival (P&lt;0.001). Overexpression of RBM25 significantly contributed to poorer survival in male patients and N0 stage patients (P&lt;0.001). Spearman analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 694 RBM25-related genes. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed the Cluster with the highest score, which positively correlated with RBM25. CDCA5 and INCENP were identified as the core functional genes related to RBM25. The overexpression of CDCA5 and INCENP in HCC patients was examined using the Human Protein Atlas database.

In this work, we proved that miR-1269b was lowly expressed in GC tissues and cell lines, which was associated with larger tumor size and lymph node metastasis. MiR-1269b overexpression repressed the multiplication, migration and invasion of GC cells while miR-1269b inhibition had the opposite effects. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) was identified as the direct target of miR-1269b in GC cells, and its overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of transfection of miR-1269b mimics on GC cell viability, migration and invasion.

High level of miR-340-5p may be harmful to the bone formation. In this study, the DOP model of rats was successfully established via streptozotocin (STZ) and ovariectomy (OVX) treatment. It was manifested by reduced body weight, insulin level, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and osteocalcin (OCN) and collagen-I expressions, as well as increased concentration of fasting blood glucose. Moreover, we found that miR-340-5p expression was increased while runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2) was decreased in femurs. Furthermore, the effects of miR-340-5p on osteogenic differentiation (OD) in high glucose (HG)-treated MC3T3-E1 cells were explored. Exposure to OD and HG contributed to elevated miR-340-5p level. Inhibition of miR-340-5p enhanced ALP level, calcium deposition, and OCN, collagen-I and RUNX2 levels. On the contrary, miR-340-5p overexpression reversed these promotional effects. Luciferase assay indicated that RUNX2 may be a target gene of miR-340-5p. Moreover, RUNX2 deficiency decreased miR-340-5p inhibition-induced ALP activity, calcium accumulation and OCN, collagen-I, RUNX2 levels.

We identified 463 differentially-expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), 47 differentially-expressed microRNAs (miRNAs), and 1,334 differentially-expressed mRNAs in IDD. Three hundred fifty-eight lncRNAs as cis-regulators could potentially target 865 genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis confirmed that IL-6, VEGFA, IGF1, MMP9, CXCL8, FGF2, IL1B, CCND1, ITGAM, PTPRC, FOS and PTGS2 were hub genes. We built a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and identified lncRNA XIST-hsa-miR-4775-PLA2G7 and lncRNA XIST-hsa-miR-424-5p-AMOT\/TGFBR3 ceRNA axes.

It was found that the microbial populations of atmospheric particles were mainly divided into three groups: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Pachytenella. The community structure of bacteria in fine particle size was more abundant than that in coarse particle size. When haze occurs, the concentration of all kinds of pathogens in fine particle size will increase. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the monitoring and management of fine particles.","1858":"Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common cancers among women worldwide. T-box transcription factor 1 (TBX1), a member of the T-box family, has anti-tumor effects in some types of cancer, but its role in CC is yet unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the functions and underlying mechanisms of TBX1 in CC. Online database UALCAN showed that TBX1 was down-regulated in CC tissues compared with normal tissues and patients with lower TBX1 expression level had a poor prognosis. TBX1 overexpression significantly decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of Hela and SiHa cells. Conversely, cell apoptosis and chemosensitivity to cisplatin were promoted in TBX1-overexpressing CC cells. Moreover, up-regulation of TBX1 inhibited both AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, dual luciferase report assay indicated that TBX1 could directly bind to miR-6727-5p. In addition, TBX1 expression was inhibited by miR-6727-5p mimic and up-regulated by miR-6727-5p inhibitor. Knockdown of TBX1 reversed the inhibitory effect of the miR-6727-5p inhibitor on CC cells. This study demonstrates that TBX1, a target gene of miR-6727-5p, acts as a tumor suppressor in CC, indicating that TBX1 may be a new target for CC therapy.","1859":"In order to isolated and identified the bacterial strains from wheat rhizosphere and evaluated the effect of different concentration of bacterial fermentation broth on the wild oats weed growth.

In this study, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to screen the key modules related to immune cell infiltration and to identify the hub genes for the molecular subtyping of PE. We first downloaded a set of PE transcriptional data (GSE75010; 157 samples: 80 PE and 77 non-PE) from the GEO database. We then analyzed the PE samples and non-PE samples for immune cell infiltration and screened cells with differences in such infiltration. Next, we downloaded the immune-related genes from an immune-related database to screen the expression profile of the immune-related genes. Then, we obtained a candidate gene set by screening the immune-related genes differentially expressed between the two groups. We used WGCNA to construct a weighted co-expression network for these candidate genes, mined co-expression modules, and then calculated the correlation between each module and immune cells with differential infiltration. We screened the modules related to infiltrating immune cells, identified the key modules' hub genes, and determined the key module genes that interacted with each other. Finally, we obtained the hub genes related to the infiltrating immune cells. We classified the preeclampsia patients by unsupervised cluster molecular typing, determined the difference of immune cell infiltration among the different PE subtypes, and calculated the expression of hub genes in these different subtypes. In conclusion, we found 41 hub genes that may be closely related to the molecular typing of PE.","1862":"The effects of polyaspartic acid and different controlled-release fertilizers with urea on dry matter accumulation and distribution, nitrogen absorption and accumulation, and the activities of enzymes involved nitrogen metabolism and yield of corn were studied by using xianyu (XY688), a maize nitrogen efficient cultivar, and Jifeng NO.2 (JF2), a maize nitrogen-inefficient cultivar, as experimental materials and through random blocks experimental design in 2019. For XY688, polyaspartic acid chelated nitrogen fertilizer (PASPN) had the highest yield, which was 21.34% higher than N0 treatment. For JF2, it also had the highest yield under PASPN combined urea treatment, which was 23.44% higher than N0 (no nitrogen fertilizer), and JF2 had a 9.7% lower yield under XY688 treatment. For XY688, PASPN treatment had the largest nitrogen uptake in grain, up to 3.14 kg\/hm2, and PASPN treatment increased 17.4% compared with N0. For JF2, grain nitrogen uptake was also the highest under PASPN treatment, which was significantly different from other treatments. Nitrogen uptake was 3.16 kg\/hm2, which increased 37.4% compared with N0. Compared with JF2, XY688 showed higher nitrogen uptake efficiency, nitrogen utilization efficiency, and partial nitrogen productivity. For XY688, the highest nitrogen absorption efficiency was SU3 (slow-release urea and ordinary urea) treatment (0.36 kg\/kg). The partial nitrogen productivity and harvest index of PASPN treatment were the highest and significantly different from other treatments.

However, the effect and mechanism of ligustrazine on retinal ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury still need to be clarified. In our study, retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5) were used to establish a retinal I\/R injury model by anaerobic cultivation. Cell viability, autophagy, and apoptosis were evaluated by cell counting kit 8 assay, transmission electron microscopy, and TUNEL staining after treatment with ligustrazine, PI3K inhibitor Ly294002, and\/or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, respectively. Besides, the levels of PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway and autophagy-related proteins were determined by western blot. Moreover, one-way ANOVA was adopted for inter-group comparisons of measurement data. Our results demonstrated that low-concentration ligustrazine significantly enhanced cell viability and suppressed cell autophagy and apoptosis of RGC-5 cells after I\/R injury, suggesting the protective effect of low-concentration ligustrazine on retinal I\/R injury. Moreover, the alleviating effect of ligustrazine on RGC-5 with retinal I\/R injury was mechanistically associated with the activation of the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway. In conclusion, low-concentration ligustrazine has a significant protective effect on RGC-5 cells with retinal I\/R injury by activating the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway.","1864":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a differentiated type of thyroid malignancy with a high incidence. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DUXAP8 has been reported to participate in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of several cancer types. However, its association with PTC has not yet been reported. The current study aimed to investigate the role of DUXAP8 in PTC and revealed the underlying mechanisms. The expression of DUXAP8 was knocked down in two PTC cell lines and the effects of DUXAP8 on the PTC biological behavior were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), wound healing, and transwell invasion assays. Luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the binding activity between miR-223-3p and DUXAP8. We found that knockdown of DUXAP8 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PTC cells. DUXAP8 could sponge miR-223-3p through the specific binding site. CXCR4 was a target of miR-223-3p. The malignant phenotypes of the PTC cells were suppressed by the over-expression of miR-223-3p. Moreover, miR-223-3p inhibition or CXCR4 over-expression partly restored the proliferation, migration, and invasion activities of DUXAP8-downregulated PTC cells. The results evidenced that DUXAP8 acted as an oncogene in PTC, these effects seemed to partly dependent on the miR-223-3p\/CXCR4 axis.","1865":"Methyl donors, a class of compounds that supply methyl groups to methyl acceptors, play important roles in the function, growth, and proliferation of cells; however, the methyl donor content in cells is not sufficient to meet their normal needs. In L-tryptophan production with E. coli, the growth and acid-producing ability of E. coli cells are weak due to the presence of exogenous plasmids that inhibit the growth of E. coli, and reduce the efficiency of exogenous gene expression. Therefore, the effect of methyl donors on L-tryptophan production was investigated. Among the methyl donors tested, choline chloride showed the most significant effect in promoting fermentation, followed by methionine. The optimum addition method involved the addition of 1.5 g\/L methionine to the culture medium, combined with continuous feeding with a glucose solution containing 1 g\/L choline chloride. The final tryptophan titer reached 53.5 g\/L; the highest biomass of bacteria reached 51.8 g\/L; and the main by-product, acetic acid, was reduced to 2.23 g\/L, which had a significant impact on the fermentation results.","1866":null,"1867":null,"1868":"The study was designed to explore the effects of Withaferin A (WFA) on hyperuricemia-induced kidney injury and its action mechanism. Potassium oxonate (PO) was employed to establish the hyperuricemic mouse model. The pathological changes of renal tissue were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin and masson trichrome staining. The levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid (UA) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) were detected using corresponding commercial kits. Expressions of collagen-related and apoptosis-associated proteins in renal tissues were, respectively, evaluated by immunofluorescence and western blotting. Cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay, and transporter expressions using western blotting. Followed by WFA, NRK-52E cells were treated with UA before evaluation of apoptosis and fibrosis. Results indicated that WFA ameliorated renal damage, improved kidney function, and decreased levels of creatinine, BUN, UA, and XOD in PO-induced hyperuricemic mice. Furthermore, WFA significantly prevented renal fibrosis and increased the expression of collagen-related proteins. Similarly, WFA markedly inhibited renal apoptosis, accompanied by changes of apoptosis-related proteins. Importantly, expression of transporters responsible for the secretion of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), OAT3, ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) was remarkably enhanced whereas that of urate transporter 1 (URAT1) and glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) was reduced in renal tissues of mice with hyperuricemia. In vitro study revealed that WFA notably ameliorated UA-induced cell fibrosis and apoptosis. Taken together, WFA improves kidney function by decreasing UA via regulation of XOD and transporter genes in renal tubular cells.","1869":"TEA domain transcription factor 4 (TEAD4) has been investigated to be implicated in the progression of various cancers, and it plays a role in the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The study was designed to investigate how TEAD4 affected the progression of ESCC through Hippo signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. The interaction of TEAD4 and Yes-associated protein (YAP) was detected though immunoprecipitation assay (IP). Following the treatment of TED-347, which was able to suppress the interaction of TEAD4 and YAP1, the malignant behaviors of cells including proliferation, invasion, and migration were assessed by EDU staining, wound healing, and transwell assay in vitro, while tumor growth was measured. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing the enhancer and promoter region of serum\/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) were constructed to analyze how TEAD4 affected the transcription of SGK1. The above cell behaviors were further analyzed after the silencing of SGK1. Results showed that TED-347 hindered the promoting effect of TEAD4 overexpression on the malignant behaviors of ESCC cells, and this effect was related to the suppression of the TEAD4\/YAP1 complex. Moreover, the promoter activity of SGK1 was obviously inhibited by TED-347. Decreased expression of SGK1 suppressed the above behaviors of cells and destroyed the effects of increased expression of TEAD4. Collectively, TEAD4\/YAP promotes the malignant process of ESCC cells, which was inhibited by the interference of SGK1. Targeting TEAD4\/YAP1 complex or SGK1 could find application in the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","1870":"Reportedly, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, yet little is known concerning the biological functions of TTN antisense RNA 1 (TTN-AS1) in HCC. In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed for detecting TTN-AS1, SPOCK1 mRNA, and miR-139-5p expressions in HCC cells and tissues. After TTN-AS1 was overexpressed or knocked down in HCC cells, CCK-8 and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were carried out for examining cell multiplication. Transwell assays were conducted for evaluating HCC cell migration and invasion. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was employed for verifying the binding relationships between miR-139-5p and TTN-AS1, and between SPOCK1 3'UTR and miR-139-5p. Western blot was employed to measure SPOCK1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin protein expressions. We demonstrated that, TTN-AS1 and SPOCK1 expression levels were remarkably enhanced in HCC cells and tissues, whereas miR-139-5p expression was observably reduced. Functional experiments suggested that TTN-AS1 knockdown markedly repressed HCC cell multiplication, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion. In addition, TTN-AS1 interacted with miR-139-5p and decreased its expression. Moreover, SPOCK1 was a miR-139-5p target, and miR-139-5p inhibitors were able to reverse TTN-AS1 knockdown-induced inhibitory effect on SPOCK1 expression. SPOCK1 overexpression plasmid could counteract TTN-AS1 knockdown-induced inhibiting impact on HCC cell multiplication, migration, invasion, and EMT. In conclusion, TTN-AS1 expression level is remarkably enhanced in HCC, and TTN-AS1 can promote the multiplication, migration, invasion, and EMT of HCC cells via regulating miR-139-5p\/SPOCK1 axis.","1871":null,"1872":"Previous studies reported that miR-330-3p was involved in the progression of several cancers, but the potential roles of miR-330-3p in ovarian cancer (OC) were unclear.

The proliferation, migration and invasion of OC cells were detected using CCK-8 assay and transwell assay, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay were used to analyze the targeted binding site of miR-330-3p and RIPK4. The results showed that miR-330-3p was significantly downregulated in OC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-330-3p inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of OC cells. Mechanistically, a dual-luciferase reported assay showed that RIPK4 is a target gene of miR-330-3p. Furthermore, rescue experiments revealed that miR-330-3p suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of OC cells by targeting RIPK4. In summary, our findings indicated that miR-330-3p suppressed the progression of OC by targeting RIPK4. Our results indicated that miR-330-3p\/RIPK4 axis might act as a novel therapeutic target for OC treatment.","1873":null,"1874":"Huge quantities of apple orchard waste (AOW) generated could be regarded as a promising alternative energy source for fuel and material production.

It was found that LINC00265 expression was significantly upregulated in GC tissue samples and cell lines compared with their normal counterparts. Additionally, LINC00265 knockdown could inhibit GC cell proliferation in vitro. Further investigation revealed that LINC00265 acted as a competing endogenous RNA for microRNA-144-3p (miR-144-3p) and inhibition of miR-144-3p markedly counteracted LINC00265 knockdown-meditated suppression on GC cell proliferation. Additionally, Chromobox 4 (CBX4) was upregulated in GC and silencing CBX4 could reduce GC cell proliferation. Then, CBX4 mRNA was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-144-3p in GC cells and LINC00265\/miR-144-3p axis could regulate CBX4 expression.

We performed multivariate Cox regression analyses to identify the hub genes affecting HCC patient prognoses. The correlations between hub genes and macrophage differentiation and immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4) were investigated. Finally, the potential mechanism was examined with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In total, seventeen differentially expressed MDGs were obtained after intersecting data from the two databases. Multivariate analysis indicated that CDC42 expression was an independent prognostic indicator in both databases. Furthermore, CDC42 showed a strong correlation with the tumor infiltration levels of immune cells in HCC tissue. Correlation analysis revealed that CDC42 expression was positively associated with M2 macrophage markers and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which indicated that CDC42 expression might be related to M2 macrophage differentiation and HCC cell immune tolerance. Finally, GSEA showed that CDC42 expression was most significantly related to the Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study showed that CDC42 expression might be an important MDG in HCC and may prove to be a new gene for studying macrophage differentiation in HCC.

The goal of this study is to investigate the role of LINC00960 in PDAC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to examine the expression levels of LINC00960 in PDAC tissues and cell lines. After transfection, the loss-of-function models of LINC00960 or interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) were established with BxPC-3 cells and Colo357 cells, and the malignant phenotypes of BxPC-3 cells and Colo357 cells were detected by CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay and Transwell assay, respectively. The interactions among LINC00960, miR-146a-5p and IRAK1 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis, and verified by luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay and RNA pull-down assay. The regulatory functions of LINC00960 and miR-146a-5p on IRAK1 were detected by Western blot. We demonstrated that the LINC00960 expression was increased in PDAC tissues and cell lines. Knocking down LINC00960 or IRAK1 could repress the viability, migration, and invasion of BxPC-3 and Colo357 cells. LINC00960 functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-146a-5p, and IRAK1 was verified as a target gene of miR-146a-5p.

The relative mRNA expression of HCP5, miR-299-3p, and SMAD5 were determined by RT-qPCR. The expressions of proteins associated with apoptosis and invasion were detected by western blot. The interaction of HCP5 with miR-299-3p and SMAD5 with miR-299-3p was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. The cellular behaviors of AGS cells were, respectively, detected by CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, migration and invasion assays, and flow cytometry. In our study, lncRNA HCP5 was highly expressed in GC cell lines compared with normal gastric epithelial cell. LncRNA HCP5 silencing inhibited AGS cells proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoted cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-299-3p downregulation could abolish the effect of HCP5 knockdown on cellular behaviors of AGS cells. Interestingly, SMAD5 is identified as the downstream target of miR-299-3p, and its expression was inhibited by miR-299-3p. More importantly, SMAD5 silencing inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells, and promoted cell apoptosis.

Through the analysis of database of Oncomine, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as well as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), in contrast to the tissue of normal gastric, COL10A1 in gastric cancer, had been upregulated. The high expression of COL10A1 was obviously related to T stage (P = 0.025) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.025). It has been illustrated by the analysis of logistic regression that COL10A1's heightened expression in gastric cancer had been essentially linked with pathological stage, tumor differentiation, and T classification. The Kaplan-Meier curve in the Kaplan-Meier plotter database (P = 0.0371) and GSE84437 (P = 0.002) indicate that patients with high COL10A1 expression possess poor prognosis, specifically GC patients with lymph node metastasis have it. TCGA's Multivariate analysis (P = 0.025) and GSE84437 dataset (P = 0.034) show that high expression COL10A1 is a key independent predictor of poor overall survival. Searching KEGG pathway enrichment by GSEA, the results suggested that 29 pathways were enriched. qRT-PCR technique was used for verification of the COL10A1's high expression in gastric cancer in contrast to the normal gastric tissues.

One of the prerequisites of enzyme fermentation production is to select and breed enzyme-producing cells with good performance. So in the process of fermentation production, the low yield of chitosanase cannot meet the current requirement. In this paper, a strain producing chitosanase was screened and identified, and a novel mutagenesis system (Atmospheric and Room Temperature Plasma (ARTP)) was selected to increase the yield of chitosanase. Then, the fermentation medium was optimized to further improve the enzyme activity of the strain. A strain of Bacillus cereus capable of producing chitosanase was screened and identified from soil samples. A mutant strain of B.cereus was obtained by Atmospheric and Room Temperature Plasma mutagenesis and bioscreening method, and chitosanase activity was 2.49 folds that of the original bacterium. After an optimized fermentation medium, the enzyme activity of the mutant strain was 1.47 folds that of the original bacterium. Combined with all the above optimization experiments, the enzyme activity of mutant strain increased by 3.66 times.

Here, we explored the ability and potential mechanism of glyphosate for accelerating horizontal transfer of conjugative plasmid-mediated ARG. The results showed that glyphosate can effectively boost horizontal transfer rate of conjugative plasmid carrying ARG. The possible mechanism analysis demonstrated that over-production of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species effectively regulated expression levels of bacterial outer membrane protein and conjugative transfer-related genes, thereby resulting into elevated horizontal transfer rate of plasmid-mediated ARG.

L-carnitine that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism represents a functional compound normally produced by Zygomycetes filamentous fungus Rhizopus oligosporus in solid-state fermentation. The present study provides the first insights on production of L-carnitine-enriched edible fungal biomass through submerged cultivation of several Ascomycetes and Zygomycetes including Aspergillus oryzae, Neurospora intermedia, Rhizopus oryzae, and Rhizopus oligosporus. A. oryzae with 3 mg L-carnitine yield per gram of fungal biomass, indicates great potential on production of this bioactive compound which is remarkably higher than the other tested fungi in this work and also previous studies. In addition to fungal strain, other factors such as cultivation time and presence of yeast extract were found to play a role. Further studies on submerged growth optimization of A. oryzae in both high-quality recipes and in medium based on low-value substrates are proposed in order to clarify its potential for production of L-carnitine-enriched fungal biomass.","1905":null,"1906":null,"1907":"It is necessary to explore new molecules for the improvement of precise diagnosis and antitumor therapies in lung cancer. LncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) play an important role in the regulation of cancer cell malignant behavior and tumor development. In this work, we found that a newly discovered lncRNA, lncRNA PGM5P4-AS1, was lower expressed in lung cancer tissues than adjacent tissues. Then, the lncRNA PGM5P4-AS1 was overexpressed or knocked-down in different lung cancer cells, and its effects on the malignant phenotypes were measured by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell cycle assay, wound healing assay, and transwell assay. The results showed that the overexpression of PGM5P4-AS1 inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion activities, while these abilities were prominently promoted by the interference of PGM5P4-AS1. Further, the growth of lung cancer tumors in nude mice was also inhibited by PGM5P4-AS1 overexpression. In mechanism, PGM5P4-AS1 has the binding site of miR-1275 and could positively regulate the expression of LZTS3 via sponging miR-1275. In conclusion, PGM5P4-AS1 could be a potential precise diagnosis and therapeutic target biomarker of lung cancer.","1908":null,"1909":null,"1910":"Many of the Orchidaceae species are threatened due to environmental changes and over exploitation for full fill global demands. The main objective of this article was critically analyzed the recent global distribution of Orchidaceae diversity, its disease patterns, microbial disease identification, detection, along with prevention and challenges. Critical analysis findings revealed that Orchidaceae growth and developments were affected indirectly or directly as a result of complex microbial ecological interactions. Studies have identified many species associated with orchids, some are pathogenic and cause symptoms such as soft rot, brown rot, brown spot, black rot, wilt, foliar, root rot, anthracnose, leaf spot. The review was provided the comprehensive data to evaluate the identification and detection of microbial disease, which is the most important challenge for sustainable cultivation of Orchidaceae diversity.

It has a high rate of metastasis and recurrence, which predict a poor prognosis. G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-kinase interacting protein-1 (GIT1) is a multifunctional scaffold protein that mediates the progression of various tumors. Studies have correlated GIT1 with HCC, however, these correlations have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the expression of GIT1 in HCC tissues and cells, and to investigate its role and potential mechanisms in HCC progression. The expression levels of GIT1 in HCC tissues and other cancers was determined by using the Oncomine and TCGA databases. Functional analysis of GIT1 in HCC was evaluated through in vitro and in vivo experiments, whereby, HCC cells were transfected with synthetically overexpressed and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus-mediated plasmids. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to establish the associations between GIT1 and clinical outcomes of 158 HCC patients. GIT1 was found to be elevated in HCC tissues where it promoted the invasion, migration, and proliferation of HCC cells. Moreover, the overexpression of GIT1 prompted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by activating extracellular regulated kinase 1\/2 (ERK1\/2) pathway, which was shown to be reversed by SCH772984, a specific ERK1\/2 inhibitor. GIT1 was also found to be associated with malignant features of HCC, leading to a poorer prognosis. In conclusion, GIT1 promotes HCC progression by inducing EMT and may reflect the course of HCC patients.","1912":"Instantaneous blood coagulation after bioengineered liver transplantation is a major issue, and the key process in its prevention is the construction of the endothelial vascular bed on biomimetic scaffolds. However, the specific molecules involved in the regulation of the vascular bed formation remain unclear. Syndecan-4 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein commonly expressed in the human body; its receptor has been reported as critical for optimal cell adhesion and initiation of intracellular signaling, indicating its promising application in vascular bed formation. In the current study, bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments were performed to evaluate whether syndecan-4 promoted endothelial cell migration and functional activation. Exogenous syndecan-4-overexpressing endothelial cells were perfused into the decellularized liver scaffold, which was assessed by Masson's trichrome staining. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to evaluate the effects of syndecan-4 on the thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) stability. We found that syndecan-4 promoted the adhesion of vascular endothelial cells and facilitated cell migration and angiogenesis. Furthermore, syndecan-4 overexpression resulted in a well-aligned endothelium on the decellularized liver scaffolds. Mechanistically, syndecan-4 destabilized THBS1 at the protein level. Therefore, our data revealed that syndecan-4 promoted the biological activity of endothelial cells on the bionic liver vascular bed through THBS1. These findings provide scientific evidences for solving transient blood coagulation after bionic liver transplantation.","1913":"N-linked glycosylation is a primary source of heterogeneity associated with recombinant monoclonal antibodies and plays a key role in a myriad of drug properties associated with biological function. The glycosylation profile of recombinant monoclonal antibodies is influenced by an array of cell culture inputs which must be carefully controlled in order to engineer the desired glycan distribution. A platform reduced intact mass method applied to monoclonal antibodies has been validated as a quantitative method to monitor the relative mannose-5 level as a surrogate for overall high mannose content in cell culture as a control strategy to ensure product quality and process consistency. The method was shown to be linear, accurate, specific, and precise for an IgG1 and IgG4 mAb allowing relative quantitation of mannose-5 in the range 0.8-11.0% and 1.0-6.2%, respectively. The method can be applied at several stages of the production process from cell culture harvest to drug substance\/drug product and is amenable to routine GMP batch testing in a quality control laboratory. Testing upstream during cell culture rather than for product release allows for an earlier assessment of product quality as the glycosylation profile remains unchanged during downstream purification.","1914":null,"1915":"Utilizing genomic data to predict cancer prognosis was insufficient. Proteomics can improve our understanding of the etiology and progression of cancer and improve the assessment of cancer prognosis. And the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has generated extensive proteomics data of the vast majority of tumors. Based on CPTAC, we can perform a proteomic pan-carcinoma analysis. We collected the proteomics data and clinical features of cancer patients from CPTAC. Then, we screened 69 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with R software in five cancers: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), children's brain tumor tissue consortium (CBTTC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). GO and KEGG analysis were performed to clarify the function of these proteins. We also identified their interactions. The DEPs-based prognostic model for predicting over survival was identified by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Cox regression model in training cohort. Then, we used the time-dependent receiver operating characteristics analysis to evaluate the ability of the prognostic model to predict overall survival and validated it in validation cohort. The results showed that the DEPs-based prognostic model could accurately and effectively predict the survival rate of most cancers.","1916":"Regulatory mechanisms of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of intestinal sepsis are unclear. This study investigated the role of rno-miR-146b-5p in sepsis-induced intestinal injury. A rat sepsis model was created using the cecal ligation and puncture method. The expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA in sepsis rats were examined using miRNA and mRNA sequencing; rno-miR-146b was selected for further investigation. The mimics and inhibitors of rno-miR-146b-5p were transfected into IEC-6 cells and then with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, and the expressions of Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and Cyclin D2 (Ccnd2) were assessed by quantitative real-time transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Next, cell counting kit-8 assay was used to detect cell viability, and scratch wound healing assay was used to assess cell migration. In sepsis rat model, crypt cell proliferation was inhibited and crypt cell apoptosis was increased. Compared with the sham control, results of miRNA and mRNA sequencing showed that there were 17 miRNAs and 1617 mRNAs that were upregulated and 123 miRNAs and 1917 mRNAs that were downregulated in the sepsis model group. The network diagrams and qRT-PCR validation indicated that rno-miR-146b-5p may inhibit the expression of Klf4. By adjusting the expression of rno-miR-146b-5p in IEC-6 cells with or without LPS treatment, we found that increased expression of rno-miR-146b-5p inhibited cell proliferation and migration and inhibited the expression of Ccnd2. rno-miR-146b-5p may play a vital role in the development of sepsis intestinal injury through targeting Klf4 expression and affecting promoter activity of Ccnd2.","1917":"Increasing evidence has shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in tumor occurrence and development and can also affect patient prognosis. In this study, we screened key prognostic genes in the breast cancer (BC) TME by analyzing the immune and stromal scores of tumor samples to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and also constructed a TME-related prognostic model. First, we obtained mRNA-Seq and related clinical information for patients with BC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and calculated the stromal and immune scores of tumor tissues using the ESTIMATE algorithm. Next, we performed functional enrichment analysis and generated protein-protein interaction networks from the DEGs that were highly related to the TME. Finally, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed on BC datasets from TCGA, and analyses were conducted on infiltrating immune cells and the human protein atlas. Together, these analyses indicated that the KLRB1 and SIT1 genes could be used as independent prognostic factors for BC, while risk score, age, and clinical stage could be used as prognostic factors. In summary, we found that the prognosis of BC is closely related to immune regulation in the TME.","1918":"Emerging evidence suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in cervical cancer (CC) progression. However, the roles and molecular mechanisms of hsa_circ_0007364 in the tumorigenesis of CC remain unclear. In the present study, we used bioinformatics analysis and a series of experimental analysis to characterize a novel circRNA, hsa_circ_0007364 was up-regulated and associated with advanced clinical features in CC patients. Hsa_circ_0007364 inhibition notably suppressed the proliferation and invasion abilities of CC cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, hsa_circ_0007364 was uncovered to sponge miR-101-5p. Additionally, methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha (MAT2A) was verified as a target gene of miR-101-5p, and its downregulation reversed the inhibitory effects of hsa_circ_0007364 knockdown on CC progression. Therefore, we suggested that hsa_circ_0007364 might serve as an oncogenic circRNA in CC progression by regulating the miR-101-5p\/MAT2A axis, which provides a potential therapeutic target to the treatment. Research highlights hsa_circ_0007364 was upregulated in CC hsa_circ_0007364 promoted CC cell progression hsa_circ_0007364\/miR-101-5p\/MAT2A axis in CC.","1919":null,"1920":null,"1921":"Cyanobacteria are Gram-negative photoautotrophic prokaryotes and have shown great importance to the Earth's ecology.

In the last decades, attempts have given to the application of synthetic biology tools and approaches in the development of cyanobacterial cell factories. Despite the successful proof-of-principle studies, large-scale application is still a technical challenge due to low yields of bioproducts. Therefore, recent efforts are underway to characterize and develop genetic regulatory parts and strategies for the synthetic biology applications in cyanobacteria.

We also discuss the limitations and future perspectives for using such novel tools in cyanobacterial biotechnology.","1922":"Because of the large population, large demand, limited arable land and many environmental factors, continuous cropping have become a very common phenomenon in China. However, long-term continuous cropping has caused a series of serious soil-borne diseases, and the yield and quality of crops to drop, which seriously restricted the sustainable development of agricultural industry. Therefore, in order to improve the yield of pepper and reduce the occurrence of soil-borne diseases, it is essential to understand the effect of continuous cropping of pepper on soil microbial community composition and abundance. In this study, high throughput sequencing was used to study the effects of seven treatments of organic fertilizers and corn straw on soil microbial community and function of pepper continuous cropping. The results showed that the yield of all treatments was significantly higher than that of the control. The soil microbial diversity and community composition showed that Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were the most abundant phylum in all treatments. In conclusion, there were significant differences among the seven treatments and the treatment of fowl dung with corn straw was the best fertilizer combination to improve the yield and output value of pepper. Besides, the addition of fowl dung and corn straw not only can improve the community and functions of microorganisms, but also enhance the ability of disease resistance, and ultimately decrease the soil-borne diseases. The results will help to provide scientific basis for rational application of organic fertilizer and corn straw, and overcoming continuous cropping obstacles.","1923":"Aggravation of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often leads to a slew of complications, but the correlation between COPD aggravation and the complications on the basis of molecular level remains unclear. In this study, gene expression profiles of COPD in patients at early and aggravation stages were collected and differentially-expressed genes were selected. Meanwhile, gene expression data implicated in COPD complications were analyzed to establish a regulatory network of COPD aggravation and COPD related complications. In addition, the gene enrichment function of DAVID6.7 was utilized to evaluate the similarities between COPD aggravation and COPD complications in term of biological process. By analyzing the genes of COPD aggravation and the COPD complications, we found 18 genes highly related to COPD aggravation, among which haptoglobin (HP) was correlated with 14 complications, followed by ADRB2, LCK and CA1, which were related to 13, 11 and 11 complications, respectively. As far as the complications concerned, obesity was regulated by 17 of the 18 genes, which indicated that there was a close correlation between COPD aggravation and obesity. Meanwhile, lung cancer, diabetes and heart failure were regulated by 15, 15 and 14 genes, respectively, among the 18 selected genes. This study suggested the driver genes of COPD aggravation were capable of extensively regulating COPD complications, which would provide a theoretical basis for development of cures for COPD and its complications.","1924":"In recent years, more and more studies have shown that antiparasitic drugs can affect a variety of biological processes of tumor cells and exhibit a potential anti-tumor activity. Although artesunate (ART), a strong bioactive derivative of artemisinin and widely used clinically against malaria, was found to have an inhibitory effect on tumor cells, it is still unclear whether ART could regulate the tumor malignancy of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of ART on migration capacities in NSCLC cell lines of A549 and H1975. Cell migration capacity was remarkably inhibited by ART treatment. The expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin was upregulated, while mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin and FN1) were inhibited by ART in both protein and mRNA levels in A549 and H1975 cells, indicating ART could suppress the epidermal interstitial transformation (EMT) of NSCLC cells. Meanwhile, BTBD7 was found highly expressed in tumor tissues of NSCLC patient and associated with poor prognosis. The anti-migration activity of ART was found to be mediated by the inhibition of BTBD7 mRNA expression and was reversed when the cells were transiently transfected with the BTBD7 overexpression plasmid. Our study demonstrated the potent anti-migratory activity of ART, thereby presenting it as a new candidate for clinical therapy in NSCLC.","1925":"Although some progress has been made in the molecular biological detection of major depression disorder (MDD), its specificity and accuracy are still insufficient. This study is aimed to find hub genes, which could contribute to MDD related suicide and provide potential therapeutic targets for diagnosis and treatment. We downloaded RNA expression and clinical information from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Dataset. Then, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to find core modules. Logistic regression was performed to identify the independent risk factors, and a scoring system was constructed based on these independent risk factors. As a result, a total of 16487 genes were selected to further conducted WGCNA analysis. We found that tan and green functional modules were exhibited high correlation with suicide behavior. 309 genes were identified in tan modules that were the strongest positively correlated with suicide behavior. Functional analysis in tan module indicated that activation of enzymes including nitric-oxide synthase and endoribonuclease, estrogen signaling pathway, glucagon signaling pathway, and legionellosis pathway were most enriched in MDD. Furthermore, we applied protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis to select the hub genes and 10 genes were found in the core area of network. Then, we identified three-gene base independent risk signature by logistic regression model, including HSPA1A, RASEF, TBC1D8B. In conclusion, our study suggests that the tan module genes are closely related to suicide behaviors, which is mainly caused by multiple signaling pathway activation. The three-genes-based signature could provide a better efficacy to predict suicidal behavior in MDD patients.","1926":null,"1927":"Although the production of L-tyrosine by recombinant Escherichia coli has been widely reported, L-tyrosine recovery from the fermentation broth has been rarely reported. Methods to recover L-tyrosine from the broth after alkaline lysis of the bacterial cells have been described. However, the broth becomes viscous and dark following cell lysis, making further extraction and purification difficult. Here, a new method for L-tyrosine extraction and purification from the fermentation broth without the lysis of bacteria is reported. First, acids, rather than bases, were used to dissolve L-tyrosine in the broth without causing lysis of the bacterial cells. E. coli cells in the broth were then removed through centrifugation. Activated carbon was then used to decolorize the supernatant containing L-tyrosine. Finally, sodium hydroxide was added to the clarified L-tyrosine solution for isoelectrocrystallization. L-tyrosine was obtained after filtration and drying. The recovery yield of L-tyrosine was 92%, and the purity was &gt;98.5%, indicating high efficiency of the new method of L-tyrosine recovery from fermented broth.

However, its anti-TNBC bio-active ingredients and possible mechanisms are still unclear. Herein, the hub bio-active compounds and underlying mechanisms of XHP against TNBC were systematically elucidated by integrating systems pharmacology approach and in vitro proteomics analysis. Using systems pharmacology analysis and molecular docking evaluation, 28 bio-active compounds and 10 potential therapeutic targets of XHP were identified. Functional analysis showed that the core therapeutic targets against TNBC were mainly involved in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway to prevent cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis, as well as to enhance cancer cell apoptosis. The in vitro proteomics analysis identified 153 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including HASP90AA1, AKT1, and EGFR, which were also identified as therapeutic targets against TNBC through systems pharmacology analysis. Protein function analysis showed that the DEPs were mainly involved in PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which was consistent with the result of systems pharmacology, suggesting the reliability of systems pharmacology analysis. Taken together, these findings uncover the underlying mechanism of XHP against TNBC, and provide a scientific method for the rational development of traditional Chinese medicine.","1929":null,"1930":"Metabolic reprogramming is a common hallmark of tumor cells and is a crucial mediator of resistance toward anticancer therapies.

To date, the role of long intergenic noncoding RNA01134 (LINC01134) in HCC have never been researched yet. Herein, we found that LINC01134 was highly expressed in HCC tissues in comparison with the matched normal liver tissues and increased LINC01134 expression correlated with shorter overall survival of patients with HCC. Additionally, we demonstrated LINC01134 downregulation significantly suppressed the proliferation ability and colony formation capacity of HCC cells. Furthermore, we revealed that LINC01134 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-4784 to upregulate structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1) in HCC cells. Meanwhile, miR-4784 inhibitor or restoration of SSRP1 could markedly attenuate the inhibitory effect of LINC01134 downregulation on HCC cells. Taken together, LINC01134 may promote the carcinogenesis of HCC at least partly via the miR-4784\/SSRP1 axis. Therefore, LINC01134\/miR-4784\/SSRP1 axis should be developed as the promising therapeutic target for HCC.","1940":"Human esophageal carcinoma (EC) is a common cancer, which leads to many deaths worldwide every year.

In the study, these series of experiments noted an upregulation of hsa_circ_0000034 in retinoblastoma cell lines and tissues. Retinoblastoma patients with raised hsa_circ_0000034 expressions were more likely to possess a more progressive International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) stage and optic nerve invasion. hsa_circ_0000034 knockdown caused a marked suppression in the proliferation and invasion of retinoblastoma cells in vitro.

Moreover, possessing the talent to produce a wide array of high-value natural products, plant endophytic microbiota also serve as an alternative way for novel drug discovery. In this review, tea, one of the world's three largest nonalcoholic beverages and a worldwide economic woody crop, was highlighted in the context of endophytic microbiota.

Nevertheless, its role in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated the expression level, biological function and mechanism of circ-LRP6 in ESCC. Circ-LRP6 was significantly upregulated in ESCC tissues and correlated with malignant clinicopathological characteristics and poor prognosis. Knockdown of circ-LRP6 evidently reduced ESCC cell viability, colony formation and invasion. Circ-LRP6 was mainly located in the cytoplasm and could sponge miR-182 to increase the expression of Myc, a well-documented proto-oncogene. Importantly, circ-LRP6 depletion significantly retarded tumor growth in vivo. And silencing of miR-182 or overexpression of Myc effectively rescued the attenuated aggressive phenotype of ESCC cells caused by circ-LRP6 knockdown. Therefore, our data indicate that circ-LRP6 is a novel oncogenic circRNA in ESCC, targeting the circ-LRP6\/miR-182\/Myc signaling may be a promising therapeutic approach for ESCC patients.","1947":null,"1948":"Many studies reported that Oxidative stress-responsive 1(OXSR1) is closely related to the malignant progression of several malignancies. Nevertheless, the expression pattern and function of OXSR1 in HCC remains unknown. In present research, it was observed that the expression of OXSR1 was abnormally elevated in HCC. Upregulated OXSR1 was associated with TNM stage, and grade and was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in HCC patients. The downregulation of OXSR1 expression effectively repressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC in vivo and in vitro experiments. Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that mutant p53-R249S was critical for regulating the aberrant elevation of OXSR1 in HCC. Chip assay indicated that p53-R249S abrogated the binding of p53 to the OXSR1 promoter region and increased the level of POL2, H3Kac and H4Kac in the promoter region of the OXSR1, thus promoting the transcriptional expression of OXSR1. GSEA revealed that numerous cancer-related pathways were enriched in the high OXSR1 expression group. Furthermore, the expression level of OXSR1 was positively correlated with the infiltration levels of tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and PD-L1 expression in HCC by TIMER platform. In summary, our study revealed that upregulated OXSR1 was a determinant of prognosis and immune infiltration in HCC. The expression of OXSR1 was released by p53-R249S mutant, and upregulated OXSR1 in HCC promoted proliferation, migration and invasion.","1949":null,"1950":"In recent years, the incidence of lung cancer has been increasing.

In order to detect pulmonary nodules early and accurately, a new assistant diagnosis method for pulmonary nodules is proposed. Firstly, the image is preprocessed and denoised by median filter, the lung parenchyma is segmented by random walk algorithm and the region of interest is extracted, and then, according to the continuity of the CT slices, the texture feature extraction method of pulmonary nodules based on volume local direction ternary pattern is used to extract the features. Finally, the pulmonary nodules are identified and classified by the assistant diagnosis model of pulmonary nodules based on Stacking algorithm. In order to illustrate the validity of the diagnosis model, the experiments are carried out by cross-validation of ten folds. Experiments using data from LIDC database show that the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method are 82.2%, 85.7%, and 78.8%, respectively.

Considering this, and aiming to facilitate and guide the future development of effective S. cerevisiae strains, this work reviews genetic engineering strategies envisioning improvements in 2nd generation bioethanol production, with special focus in process-related traits, xylose consumption, and consolidated bioprocessing. Altogether, the genetic toolbox described proves S. cerevisiae to be a key microorganism for the establishment of a bioeconomy, not only for the production of lignocellulosic bioethanol, but also having potential as a cell factory platform for overall valorization of renewable biomasses.","1952":null,"1953":"The regulatory network of ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated miRNAs is not fully understood. In this study, we aim to investigate the global profile and regulatory network of UC associated miRNAs in the context of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). UC was induced in C57BL mice using DSS. Differentially expressed miRNAs were screened by RNA sequencing and subjected to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway enrichment analysis. RT-qPCR was used to verify the differential expression of miRNAs and candidate target mRNA. Luciferase reporter vector bearing a miRNA binding site was constructed to verify the binding site of the miRNA on mRNA. A total of 95 miRNAs (31 were up-regulated and 64 were down regulated) differentially expressed in the colonic tissues of the UC mice. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, IL-25 pathway genes were enriched. Subsequent RT-qPCR confirmed a decreased expression of IL-25 and a significant up regulation of IL-25 target miRNAs including mmu-miR-135b-5p, mmu-miR-7239-5p and mmu-miR-691 in UC mice. Using the luciferase assay, we verified the biding sites of mmu-miR-135b-5p and mmu-miR-691 to the IL-25 3'UTR. In conclusion, mmu-miR-135b-5p:IL-25 and mmu-miR-691:IL-25 interactions are important pathways that may exert a protective role in UC.

Low CENPW expression was correlated with a better prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, compared to high CENPW expression. The results of qRT-PCR and western blot assay showed that CENPW was effectively knocked down in HCC cells using siRNA transfection. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited. Cell apoptosis rates were increased. The cells were arrested in the G2\/M phase of the cell cycle. Subsequently, 127 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on RNA-seq data. GO and KEGG enrichment and PPI network analysis were performed. The novel DEGs were found and mainly enriched in nucleosome assembly and the complement system. In summary, our study indicated that overexpression of CENPW implied unfavorable prognosis and CENPW might be the potential predictive biomarker in liver cancer.

The existing treatment procedures used extensively for the resource extraction are hydrometallurgy and pyro-metallurgy and crude recycling practices in the informal sector. However, these methods are prone to cause secondary pollutants with certain drawbacks. Also, the existing informal recycling procedures resulted in insignificant occupational health hazards and severe environmental threats.

The tumor microenvironment contributed to tumorigenesis, tumor progress, tumor metastasis, tumor immune resistance, tumor chemotherapy, and tumor immunotherapy. In the current study, we explored the contributions of the infiltrated dendritic cells insulted by Wnt1 in tumor microenvironment to neuropathic pain associated with cancers. The different transcriptome of infiltrated dendritic cells from lung adenocarcinoma and from juxtatumor indicated that thousands of genes were up-regulated by the tumor microenvironment, some of which were enriched in pain pathway. The paracrine factors such as TNF, WNT10A, PDGFA, and NRG1 were also elevated in tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells. The receptors of paracrine factors were highly expressed on dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and not altered in pain conditions. Single-cell RNA-seq data unveiled that TNFSF1 was expressed in neurons, microglial cells, and endothelial cells. PDGFRA was only expressed in microglial cells. ERBB3 was only expressed in neurons. FZD1 and 3 were extensively expressed in various cells. The components composed of signaling pathways associated with the above paracrine factors participated in pain networks. The transcription factors activated by paracrine factor signaling regulated the expression of genes associated with pain. TNF, WNT10A, and PDGFA were extensively expressed in multiple cancers, but their expression in patients did not distribute normally.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyzed H19 expression in chemotherapy-resistant and sensitive breast cancer tissues. Both knockdown and overexpression of H19 were used to assess the sensitivity to doxorubicin in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to explore the doxorubicin resistance mechanism of H19. We observed that the H19 expression was significantly upregulated in chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer tissues and doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of H19 enhanced the sensitivity to doxorubicin both in vitro and in vivo. While H19 overexpression developed doxorubicin-resistant in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it was revealed that H19 negatively regulated PARP1 expression in breast cancer cells following doxorubicin treatment. Knockdown of H19 sensitized breast cancer cells to doxorubicin by promoting PARP1 upregulation. H19 overexpression could recapitulate doxorubicin resistance by PARP1 downregulation.

In the present study, we aimed to clarify the role and mechanisms of sCLU in regulating the chemoresistance of gastric cancer cells. Cell apoptosis and cell viability were evaluated by annexin V\/propidium iodide staining and CCK8. Expression of sCLU and miR-195-5P was detected using quantitative RT-PCR assays. The expression of sCLU in gastric cancer tissues was detected by RT-PCR assays. Upregulating or downregulating sCLU or miR-195-5P in gastric cancer cells was used to evaluate the mechanisms of chemoresistance. We found that sCLU was significantly elevated in the MGC-803\/5-FU and SGC-7901 cells, and the downregulating sCLU sensitized MGC-803\/5-FU and SGC-7901 cells to cisplatin and Docetaxel by upregulation of miR-195-5P.

Here, the authors designed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) or plasmid-based small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting survivin and tested its effects on radiosensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) treatment of C33A cells in vitro, as well as on the tumorigenicity of C33A cells in nude mice in vivo. Transient transfection of survivin siRNA into C33A cells suppressed survivin expression, induced cell apoptosis and G2\/M arrest and reduced cell proliferation, clone formation ability after IR, followed by p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) upregulation. But, transient transfection of survivin siRNA alone has no significant effect on cell growth and apoptosis. To confirm that PUMA upregulation is necessary for survivin silencing -induced radiosensitivity to IR treatment, the effect of targeting PUMA in survivin sliencing cells was observed. The results showed that targeting PUMA in survivin sliencing cells rescued C33A cells' radioresistance. Furthermore, knocking down survivin expression combined with IR treatment significantly slowed tumor growth and promoted tumor cell apoptosis in C33A xenografted tumors.

The present work starts with a review on the usage of open pond and photobioreactor in culturing various microalgae strains, followed by an in-depth evaluation on the common harvesting techniques used to collect microalgae from culture medium. The harvesting methods discussed include filtration, centrifugation, flocculation, and flotation. Additionally, the advanced extraction technologies using ionic liquids as extractive solvents applied to extract high-value bio-compounds such as lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and other bioactive compounds from microalgae biomass are summarized and discussed.

However, details about the PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 gene family, which is the core component of ABA signaling in Camellia sinensis, are unknown. In this work, we identified 14 pyrabactin resistance-likes (PYLs), 84 type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2Cs), and 8 SNF1-related protein kinase 2s (SnRK2s) from C. sinensis. The transcriptomic analysis indicated that PYL-PP2C-SnRK2s were associated with changes of leaf color and the response of C. sinensis to drought and salt stressors. Changes of the expression of Snrk2s were not significant in the process of leaf color change or drought and salt stress response, suggesting that PYLs and PP2Cs may not interact with SnRK2s in C. sinensis during these processes. Finally, Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) construction and interaction networks analysis demonstrated that PYLs and PP2Cs were associated with multiple metabolic pathways during the changes of leaf color.","2023":"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main pathological type of lung cancer and has a low overall five-year survival rate. miR-187 has been reported to play major roles in various tumor types. In this study, we explored the impact of miR-187 on NSCLC. qRT-PCR results demonstrated that miR-187 expression is lower in NSCLC and cancer cells than normal tissues and normal lung cells. miR-187 expression levels are associated with tumor size, TNM stage and overall survival rate. MTS and colony formation assays showed that high miR-187 expression inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and colony formation ability, and flow cytometry showed that miR-187 overexpression induces cell cycle arrest at the G0\/G1 phase. A luciferase reporter assay showed that FGF9 is a target of miR-187. miR-187 overexpression reduces the expression of FGF9, cyclin D1 CDK4 and CDK6. Therefore, miR-187 may present a new NSCLC treatment target by regulates cyclins-related protein expression.","2024":"Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 was cultivated using palm oil mill effluent (POME) in a novel-designed photobioreactor (NPBR) and glass-made vessel photobioreactor (PBR). The comparison was made on biomass and lipid productions, as well as its pollutants removal efficiencies. NPBR is transparent and is developed in thin flat panels with a high surface area per volume ratio. It is equipped with microbubbling and baffles retention, ensuring effective light and CO2 utilization. The triangular shape of this reactor at the bottom serves to ease microalgae cell harvesting by sedimentation. Both biomass and lipid yields attained in NPBR were 2.3-2.9 folds higher than cultivated in PBR. The pollutants removal efficiencies achieved were 93.7% of chemical oxygen demand, 98.6% of total nitrogen and 96.0% of total phosphorus. Mathematical model revealed that effective light received and initial mass contributes toward successful microalgae cultivation.

Atherosclerosis is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the functional role of lncRNAs in atherosclerosis is largely unknown. Here we identified LOC285194 as a key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis during atherosclerosis. The expression of LOC285194 was dramatically down-regulated in a aortic atherosclerotic plaques of well-defined model of apolipoprotein-E knockout (ApoE-\/-) mice. Moreover, we found that targeting LOC285194 results in neointimal hyperplasia in vivo in carotid artery injury model. We also showed that targeting LOC285194 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro, and vice versa. In addition, targeting LOC285194 promotes cell invasion and migration in vitro. Our studies identify LOC285194 as a novel regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis and suggest that this lncRNA could serve as a therapeutic target to treat atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular disorders.","2026":"Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are intermediate products in anaerobic digestion. The effect of substrate loading or inoculum to substrate ratio (ISR), the addition of methanogen inhibitor, O2 presence, control the reactor's pH, and inoculum adaptation on the VFAs production from food waste through acidogenesis process was investigated in this study. Addition of 2-bromoethane sulfonic (BES) as methanogen inhibitor suppressed VFA consumption by methanogens at ISR 1:1. At higher substrate loading (ISR 1:3), methane production can be suppressed even without the addition of BES. However, at high substrate loading, controlling the pH during acidogenesis is important to achieve high VFAs yield. Acclimatization of inoculum is also one of the strategies to achieve high VFA yield. The highest VFAs yield obtained in this work was 0.8 g VFA\/g VS added at ISR 1:3, controlled pH at 6, with the presence of initial O2 (headspace unflushed).","2027":null,"2028":"","2029":"","2030":"This study is aimed to explore the roles of LINC00528 in myocardial infarction (MI) progression.

The newly developmental rattan, straw biomass rattan (SBR) as weaving material, has been exploited as per our previous work, which possessed advantages of both natural rattan and pure plastic rattan. The main objective of the work was to improve the properties of SBR by corn starch (CS). Based on the manufacturing of the above composites, the experiments of SBR that enhanced with CS on mechanical properties, melting performance, hydroscopicity, thermogravimetric analysis, and microstructures were tested in this study. The results revealed that when the content of CS increased gradually within the range of 0, 3, 6, 9 12, and 15 wt.%, the mechanical properties and melt index of the composite both increased first and then decreased, with 6 to 12 wt.% as the optimal dosage range. In contrast, the water absorption of SBR kept increased in this range, indicating an easier biodegradable. With CS added, the microstructure of SBR was examined by scanning electron microscope and found the microscopic surfaces and sections to become smoother, and that could improve the compatibility and tenacity between the materials.

Biological hydrogen methanation (BHM) facilitates wind and solar energy through the storage of otherwise curtailed or constrained electricity in the form of the gaseous energy vector biomethane. Biological methanation in the circular economy involves the reaction of hydrogen - produced during electrolysis - with carbon dioxide in biogas to produce methane (4H2 + CO2 = CH4 + 2H2), typically increasing the methane output of the biogas system by 70%. In this paper, several BHM systems were researched and a compilation of such systems was synthesized, facilitating comparison of key parameters such as methane evolution rate (MER) and retention time. Increased retention times were suggested to be related to less efficient systems with long travel paths for gases through reactors. A significant lack of information on gas-liquid transfer co-efficient was identified.","2039":"MiR-25 is a well-documented oncogenic miRNA implicated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) development, progression and metastasis. However, whether and how miR-25 is involved in the development and metastasis of ESCC remain un-addressed. By using qRT-PCR analysis to compare levels of miR-25 in ESCC tissues with or without lymph node metastasis (LNM), it showed that ESCC tissues with LNM had increased levels of miR-25, which was correlated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assays indicated that targeting miR-25 could reverse EMT, and reduce in vitro cell migration and invasion, but not apoptosis and proliferation of ESCC. Furthermore, targeting miR-25 inhibited in vivo lung metastasis, and vice versa. And E-cadherin was a direct target of miR-25 through which affected EMT process and metastasis of ESCC. It is therefore indicated that miR-25 promotes metastasis of ESCC through E-cadherin and EMT events, thus may serves as a negative prognostic factor and possible target for treatment of ESCC patients.","2040":null,"2041":"Microalgae biomass contains various useful bio-active components. Microalgae derived biodiesel has been researched for almost two decades. However, sole biodiesel extraction from microalgae is time-consuming and is not economically feasible due to competitive fossil fuel prices.

Microalgae are likewise utilized to extract high-value products such as pigments, anti-oxidants and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which are useful in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry. These compounds can be extracted simultaneously or sequentially after biodiesel extraction to reduce the total expenditure involved in the process. This approach of bio-refinery is necessary to promote microalgae in the commercial market. Researchers have been keen on utilizing the bio-refinery approach to exploit the valuable components encased by microalgae. Apart from all the beneficial components housed by microalgae, they also help in reducing the anthropogenic CO2 levels of the atmosphere while utilizing saline or wastewater. These benefits enable microalgae as a potential source for bio-refinery approach.

We first found the murA and murB genes were potentially related to temperature-sensitive secretion of glutamate, which were not existed in a temperature-sensitive mutant. When replenishing murA or\/and murB in the mutant, the temperature sensitivity was weakened. While, their knockout in a wild-type strain resulted in temperature-sensitive secretion of glutamate. Peptidoglycan analysis showed that deletion of murA and murB decreased the peptidoglycan synthesis. Comparative metabolomics analysis suggested that the variation in cell wall structure resulted in decreased overall cellular metabolism but increased carbon flow to glutamate synthesis, which was a typical metabolism pattern in industrial temperature-sensitive producing strains. This study clarifies the mechanism between murA and murB deletion and the temperature-sensitive secretion of glutamate in C. glutamcium, and provides a reference for the metabolic engineering of cell wall to obtain increased bioproduction of chemicals.","2048":null,"2049":"Undoubtedly, the food industry is undergoing a dynamic process of transformation in its continual development in order to meet the requirements and solve the great problems represented by a constantly growing global population and food claimant in both quantity and quality.

We set up biochemical and cell biology analyzes to analyze SREBP1 expression and chemoresistance. We found that SREBP1 was overexpressed in chemoresistant CRC samples, and that SREBP1 overexpression was correlated with poorer patient survival. Targeting SREBP1 increased chemosensitivity to gemcitabine (Gem) in CRC cells. Additionally, SREBP1 overexpression increased chemoresistance to Gem in CRC cells. SREBP1 overexpression downregulated caspase-7 and decreased CRC cell sensitivity to Gem. Low SREBP1 expression was correlated with high caspase-7 expression in CRC patient samples. Low caspase-7 expression was correlated with poor patient survival. Our findings indicated that upregulation of caspase-7 caused by downregulation of SREBP1 may be a novel prognostic biomarker, and may represent a new therapeutic target in CRC.","2051":"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a well-established technology used for producing biogas or biomethane alongside the slurry used as biofertilizer. However, using a variety of wastes and residuals as substrate and mixed cultures in the bioreactor makes AD as one of the most complicated biochemical processes employing hydrolytic, acidogenic, hydrogen-producing, acetate-forming bacteria as well as acetoclastic and hydrogenoclastic methanogens. Hydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, valeric and caproic acid and other carboxylic acids such as succinic and lactic acids are formed as intermediate products. As these acids are important precursors for various industries as mixed or purified chemicals, the AD process can be bioengineered to produce VFAs alongside hydrogen and therefore biogas plants can become biorefineries. The current review paper provides the theory and means to produce and accumulate VFAs and hydrogen, inhibit their conversion to methane and to extract them as the final products. The effects of pretreatment, pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT), organic loading rate (OLR), chemical methane inhibitions, and heat shocking of the inoculum on VFAs accumulation, hydrogen production, VFAs composition, and the microbial community were discussed.

The data demonstrated that the expression of the STIM1 was significantly higher in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues than in benign lesions and was associated with advanced NSCLC T stage. Knockdown of STIM1 expression in NSCLC cell lines A549 and SK-MES-1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induces A549 and SK-MES-1 cell arrest at the G2\/M and S phases of the cell cycle. Western blotting showed that the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 and CDK2 were reduced while knockdown of STIM1 expression. Furthermore, knockdown of STIM1 in NSCLC cells significantly reduced the levels of xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. These data indicate that aberrant expression of the STIM1 protein may contribute to NSCLC progression. Future studies should focus on targeting STIM1 as a novel strategy for NSCLC therapy.","2053":"Nowadays, there is an increasing concern toward substituting the scarce wood fibers with alternative lignocellulosic fibers that originate from crop residue to reinforce biocomposites. In this paper, the potential application of coffee hull (CH) of the reinforced polyethylene (PE) matrix composites was studied for the first time. Experiments of composite that enhanced with CH on mechanical properties, hydroscopicity, thermogravimetric analysis, fiber treatment, and microstructures were tested in this study. The PE matrix was reinforced with varying volume fractions of CH and was studied. The results show that incorporation of coffee hull markedly improved the mechanical properties of the reinforced high-density polyethylene (HDPE) matrix composites. Micrographs show a strong interfacial adhesion between the CH fiber particles. This property may be the main reason for the stability between composites. At the same time this work investigated the effect of different treatments on the mechanical properties and water absorption behavior of composites. The fiber surface treatments were done using active chemicals such as calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), silane coupling agent (SCA), maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MA-g-PP), stearic acid (SA), ethylene bis stearamide (EBS) and the combination (MA-g-PP, SA, EBS). The results show that (Ca(OH)2)treatment is the best way to improve its properties.

Flow cytometry analysis indicated that EGCG induced apoptosis and disrupted cell cycle progression at G2\/M phase. Moreover, EGCG inhibited miR-25 expression and increased PARP, pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9 at protein levels. Restoration of miR-25 inhibited EGCG-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, EGCG suppressed tumor growth in vivo by downregulating the expression of miR-25 and proteins associated with apoptosis, which was further confirmed by a reduction of Ki-67 and increase of pro-apoptotic PARP expression as determined by immunohistochemistry staining.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure the serum miR-203 levels in 134 patients with AML and 70 healthy controls. The results demonstrated that serum miR-203 expression was significantly reduced in AML patients compared with healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed miR-203 could distinguish AML cases from normal controls. Low serum miR-203 levels were associated with worse clinical features, as well as poorer overall survival and relapse free survival of AML patients. Moreover, multivariate analysis confirmed low serum miR-203 expression to be an independent unfavorable prognostic predictor for AML. The bioinformatics analysis showed that the downstream genes and pathways of miR-203 was closely associated with tumorigenesis. Downregulation of miR-203 in AML cell lines upregulated the expression levels of oncogenic promoters such as CREB1, SRC and HDAC1. Thus, these findings demonstrated that serum miR-203 might be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of AML.","2060":"In the development of medicinally important Orchidaceae, the extent of fungal endophytes specificity is not presently very clear.

However, there are few reports about miR-25 expression and function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we investigated the biological role of miR-25 in NSCLC and its underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that the upregulation of miR-25 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in 113 NSCLC patients. Moreover, the up-regulation of miR-25 was associated with poor survival of NSCLC patients and might be used as an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, forced expression of miR-25 enhanced H358 and Calu-1 cell migration and invasion, but not apoptosis and proliferation in vitro. Elevation of invasion and metastasis by miR-25 directly and significantly correlated with inactivation of CDH1 expression. Therefore, patients with up-regulated miR-25 are prone to lymph node metastasis and thus have a poor prognosis.","2066":"Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a medical-practical method and has been applied to solve many medical complications. Animal usage as sensors and actuators, mind-controlled machines, and animal navigation are some of the non-medical DBS applications. One of the brain areas used in ratbot navigation is the Ventral Posteromedial Nucleus (VPM), which creates non-volunteer head rotation. Rat training by water\/food restriction can be used to create forward movement. In this study, a combination of VPM stimulation and water\/food restriction has been employed to establish a complete navigation system. Five rats responded to VPM stimulations. However, with three of them, rats rotated to the same direction after the stimulations of either VPM side of the brain. Two rats rotated bilaterally, proportionate to the VPM stimulation side. These two rats were trained in a T-shape maze and became ratbots. The results of the 3-session test showed that their navigation performances were 96% and 86%, respectively.

An observed relationship between XIST and the p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway was further explored by using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Our results showed that suppression of XIST by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) impeded U2OS cell growth, induced apoptosis and lessened OS xenograft tumor growth. Targeting XIST increased NF-kB-dependent PUMA upregulation in U2OS cells. Upregulation of PUMA is correlated with suppression of XIST-induced apoptosis in U2OS cells. Therefore, inhibition of XIST could promote U2OS cell death via activation of NF-kB\/PUMA pathways.","2068":null,"2069":"Groundcover management can significantly affect soil microbial metabolic activities, especially carbon metabolism, in apple orchards.

We, therefore, studied soil microbial carbon metabolism in an apple orchard on China's Loess Plateau under four single species cover crops (the grass Dactylis glomerata L., and the legumes Trifolium repens, Coronilla varia L., Lotus corniculatus L.) during spring, summer and fall. Cover cropping significantly, but differentially, promoted soil microbial carbon metabolism in spring and fall. However, cover cropping leads to a significant reduction of soil moisture in spring and summer due to the competition of soil moisture between the cover crops and apple trees, which probably lead to the changes in types of carbon substances metabolizing by soil microbes in summer. Besides, cover crop significantly enhanced soil organic carbon contents between three seasons while clean cultivation had slight, non-significant effects. The promotion of soil microbial metabolic activities was probably an important mechanism for the carbon accumulation, and we postulate that leguminous cover plants may have significantly different effects, mediated through their root exudates, from grasses on soil carbon contents.","2070":"Virotherapy on the basis of oncolytic vaccinia virus (VACV) strains is a promising approach for cancer therapy. Recently, we showed that the oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h68 has a therapeutic potential in treating human prostate and hepatocellular carcinomas in xenografted mice. In this study, we describe the use of dynamic boolean modeling for tumor growth prediction of vaccinia virus-injected human tumors. Antigen profiling data of vaccinia virus GLV-1h68-injected human xenografted mice were obtained, analyzed and used to calculate differences in the tumor growth signaling network by tumor type and gender. Our model combines networks for apoptosis, MAPK, p53, WNT, Hedgehog, the T-killer cell mediated cell death, Interferon and Interleukin signaling networks. The in silico findings conform very well with in vivo findings of tumor growth. Similar to a previously published analysis of vaccinia virus-injected canine tumors, we were able to confirm the suitability of our boolean modeling for prediction of human tumor growth after virus infection in the current study as well. In summary, these findings indicate that our boolean models could be a useful tool for testing of the efficacy of VACV-mediated cancer therapy already before its use in human patients.","2071":null,"2072":"Intercropping can introduce greater plant diversity and functional complementarity in an arable crop system but inter- and intracompetition can between intercropped crops. The rhizo-box was established of apple-white clover intercropped system to examine the competitive relationship between intercropped crops on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that the competitive relationship between intercropped crops was dynamic and changed with the crop competitiveness. Crop competitiveness was characterized by root development, although intercropping inhibited the development and nutrient accumulation aboveground of apple trunks and branches, intercropped apples still maintained a larger root system than under monoculture and the root morphology of intercropped apples changed significantly. White clover had lower competitiveness than apple at the beginning of the year, which was reflected in the inhibited development in May. However in July and October, intercropped white clover had more biomass and nutrient accumulation than under monoculture.","2073":null,"2074":null,"2075":null,"2076":"We demonstrated previously that expression of Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) in Pichia pastoris could be significantly increased by addition of gene propeptide, optimized signal peptide codons and manipulation of gene dosage.

PCR results demonstrated the site-specific integration of the exogenous luciferase gene into the genome. To validate the novel luciferase knock-in system, a CRISPR\/Cas9 transcription activation\/repression system for the PGRN gene was constructed and applied to the knock-in system. In addition, phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate), previously reported as activating the expression of PGRN, was applied to the system.

The expression of miR-485-5p were quantified with real time quantitative PCR and it was found that the level of miR-485-5p was lower in SCLC tissues than normal tissues. In cultured SCLC cell lines, overexpression of miR-485-5p reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, whereas knockdown of miR-485-5p performed contrary. FLOT2 expression was obviously upregulated and negatively correlated with miR-485-5p expression level in SCLC tissues. Overexpression of miR-485-5p significantly inhibited the protein expression of flotillin-2 (FLOT2) in cultured SCLC cells. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that FLOT2 was a direct target of miR-485-5p in SCLC cells. It is concluded that miR-485-5p, as a tumor suppressor, inhibits the growth and metastasis in SCLC by targeting FLOT2.

Based on ISP2, uniform design was used to optimize medium formula and fermentation conditions. After optimization, the inhibition efficacy of the 20-time diluted supernatant against A. parasiticus NFRI-95 mycelial growth and aflatoxin production was increased from 0-23.1% to 100%. Moreover, compared to the original protocol, medium cost and fermentation temperature were significantly reduced, and dependence on seawater was completely relieved, thus preventing the fermentor from corrosion.

Currently, expensive and time-consuming biological assays can only determine a very small portion of all RPIs, which calls for computational approaches to help biologists efficiently and correctly find candidate RPIs. Here, we integrated a successful computing algorithm, conjoint triad feature (CTF), and another method, chaos game representation (CGR), for representing RNA-protein pairs and by doing so developed a prediction model based on these representations and random forest (RF) classifiers. When testing two benchmark datasets, RPI369 and RPI2241, the combined method (CTF+CGR) showed some superiority compared with four existing tools. Especially on RPI2241, the CTF+CGR method improved prediction accuracy (ACC) from 0.91 (the best record of all published works) to 0.95. When independently testing a newly constructed dataset, RPI1449, which only contained experimentally validated RPIs released between 2014 and 2016, our method still showed some generalization capability with an ACC of 0.75.

To further improve the classification performance of microarray data, a gene selection approach based on the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) and the neighborhood rough set (NRS) is proposed. First, the FLD method is employed to reduce the preliminarily genetic data to obtain features with a strong classification ability, which can form a candidate gene subset. Then, neighborhood precision and neighborhood roughness are defined in a neighborhood decision system, and the calculation approaches for neighborhood dependency and the significance of an attribute are given. A reduction model of neighborhood decision systems is presented. Thus, a gene selection algorithm based on FLD and NRS is proposed.

We further highlight how the properties of graphene are being exploited for scaffolds in bone tissue engineering, comprehensively surveying recent experimental works featuring graphene and graphene derivatives. Bone tissue engineering, for the purpose of this survey, is the use of a scaffolding material to either induce formation of bone from the surrounding tissue or to act as a carrier or template for implanted bone cells or other agents.

The chimera contains amino acid residues 240-460 of Shigella invasion plasmid antigen B (IpaB) and the C-terminus of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE). Amino acid sequences of 537 peptide linkers were obtained from two protein linker databases. 3D structures of IpaB-CPE290-319, IpaB-CPE184-319, IpaB-CPE194-319 and 537 newly designed IpaB-linker-CPE290-319 constructs with varying linker regions were predicted. These predicted 3D structures were merged with the 3D structures of native IpaB240-460, CPE194-319, CPE184-319 and CPE290-319 to select the structure most similar to native IpaB and C-CPE. Several in silico tools were used to determine the suitability of the selected IpaB-C-CPE structure as a vaccine candidate. None of the 537 linkers was capable of preserving the native structure of CPE290-319 within the IpaB-linker-CPE290-319 structure. In silico analysis determined that the IpaB-CPE194-319 3D structure was the most similar to the 3D structure of the respective native CPE domain and that it was a stable chimeric protein exposing multiple B-cell epitopes. IpaB-CPE194-319 was designed for its capability to bind to human intestinal epithelial and M cells and to accumulate on these cells. The predicted B-cell epitopes are likely to be capable of inducing a mucosal antibody response in the human intestine against Shigella IpaB. This study also showed that the higher binding affinities of CPE184-319 and CPE194-319 to claudin molecules than those of CPE290-319 is the result of preserving the 3D structures of CPE184-319 and CPE194-319 when they are linked to the C-termini of other proteins.","2103":"In October 2016, a rapid assessment survey of ascidian species was conducted in shellfish farms at Killary Fjord, in the west of Ireland.

In our previous work, we structured the LGAGGSLA recombinant expression system and optimized the culturing conditions for preparing a fusion protein. However, the fusion protein was not cleaved by enterokinase to obtain LGAGGSLA. Because the cleavage conditions of commercial enterokinase were not specific and recombinant engineered bacteria had the potential to be used in industrial processes, in this addendum, we calculated the mass and volume yields of key processing steps in the preparation of LGAGGSLA, and established a model of cleavage conditions with the cleavage ratio of LGAGGSLA.

The network (AMiCI) comprises participants of more than 60 universities, research institutes and companies across 29 European countries and, to-date, represents the most comprehensive consortium targeting use of these emergent technologies in healthcare settings. More specifically, the network will prioritise coordinated research on the effects (both positive and negative) of antimicrobial coatings in healthcare sectors; know-how regarding availability and mechanisms of action of (nano)-coatings; possible adverse effects of such materials (e.g., potential emergence of microbial resistance or emission of toxic agents into the environment); standardised performance assessments for antimicrobial coatings; identification and dissemination of best practices by hospitals, other clinical facilities, regulators and manufacturers.","2132":"There is an urgent need to find an environment friendly and sustainable technology for alternative energy due to rapid depletion of fossil fuel and industrialization.

This would give a comprehensive insight into the characteristics, options, modifications, and evaluations of these parameters and their effects on process development of MFCs.","2133":"Ulva prolifera is a green macroalgae with an extremely high growth rate that can accumulate biomass with considerable protein content. To set up an available seaweed expression system, a prior step is to isolate endogenous and strong constitutive promoters. For this reason, the full-length genomic actin1 gene from U. prolifera (Upactin1) was cloned and its 5' flanking sequence was obtained by genome walking. The Upactin1 open reading frame consisted of 1134 nucleotides encoding 377 amino acid residues. Besides 4 exons and 3 introns in the coding region, an extra leader intron was identified in the 5' untranslated region. According to quantitative GUS assays based on transient expression, the promoter activity of the Upactin1 5' flanking region was found to be several times higher than that of the widely-used cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) in all tested species of Ulva. In addition, precise deletion of the leader intron led to a significant decrease of promoter strength in U. prolifera, and almost entire loss of strength in U. linza and U. pertusa. To our knowledge, this is the first report to prove function of a leader intron in algae. The 5' flanking region of Upactin1 was shown to be a much stronger promoter than the foreign CaMV35S, and its activity was highly dependent on the presence of the leader intron. We propose that the Upactin1 promoter could serve as an endogenous and strong constitutive element for genetic engineering of U. prolifera.","2134":"The emerging genome editing technology has enabled the creation of gene knock-in cells easily, efficiently, and rapidly, which has dramatically accelerated research in the field of mammalian functional genomics, including in humans. We recently developed a microhomology-mediated end-joining-based gene knock-in method, termed the PITCh system, and presented various examples of its application. Since the PITCh system only requires very short microhomologies (up to 40 bp) and single-guide RNA target sites on the donor vector, the targeting construct can be rapidly prepared compared with the conventional targeting vector for homologous recombination-based knock-in. Here, we established a streamlined pipeline to design and perform PITCh knock-in to further expand the availability of this method by creating web-based design software, PITCh designer ( http:\/\/www.mls.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp\/smg\/PITChdesigner\/index.html ), as well as presenting an experimental example of versatile gene cassette knock-in. PITCh designer can automatically design not only the appropriate microhomologies but also the primers to construct locus-specific donor vectors for PITCh knock-in. By using our newly established pipeline, a reporter cell line for monitoring endogenous gene expression, and transgenesis (TG) or knock-in\/knockout (KIKO) cell line can be produced systematically. Using these new variations of PITCh, an exogenous promoter-driven gene cassette expressing fluorescent protein gene and drug resistance gene can be integrated into a safe harbor or a specific gene locus to create transgenic reporter cells (PITCh-TG) or knockout cells with reporter knock-in (PITCh-KIKO), respectively.","2135":null,"2136":"Photoautotrophic cyanobacteria have been developed to convert CO2 to valuable chemicals and fuels as solar-to-chemical (S2C) and solar-to-fuel (S2F) platforms.

The plasticity of the cyanobacterial metabolism has been proposed to be advantageous for the development of S2C and S2F processes. The rewiring of the sugar catabolism and of the phosphoketolase pathway in the central cyanobacterial metabolism allowed for an enhancement in the level of target products by redirecting the carbon fluxes.

Culture-independent approaches are commonly used to investigate the microbial communities of fermented food. To evaluate the influence of different DNA (DNA) extraction methods on estimates of bacterial community profiles from 4 PBs, the lysis efficiency, DNA yield, purity and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles of V3 region of a 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene were acquired. The cell lysis pattern of SDS + beads and Lysing matrix E+ beads (methods 3 and 4) showed higher cell lysis efficiency than SDS and SDS + Lysozyme (methods 1 and 2) in all PBs. SDS + beads obtained the largest DNA yield of the 4 methods. Moreover, methods 3 and 4 resulted in higher H' values and generated more global bacteria profiles than other methods. Overall, our results demonstrate that the properties of PB significantly affect the efficiency of DNA extraction methods. Methods 3 and 4 were both suitable for DNA extraction from PB.

Echinodontium taxodii is a promising white-rot fungus for biologic pretreatment. In this study, we extracted the extracellular products of E. taxodii under solid-state fermentation conditions, mixed the extracellular products with cellulase to build a composite enzymatic system, and systematically evaluated the effect of this system on the hydrolysis of acid-pretreated and raw maize stovers. We found that the extracellular products from E. taxodii could significantly improve the hydrolysis efficiency of cellulase, with a synergistic action between the extracellular products and cellulase. Corn stovers treated with extracellular products were suitable for the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulase. Furthermore, we found that pure proteins from the extracellular products were not sufficient to generate synergistic action. This finding suggests that non-protein substances may also be involved in the synergistic action between the extracellular products and cellulase.","2144":"","2145":"The adaptive bacterial immune system CRISPR-Cas is revolutionizing all fields of life science and has opened up new frontiers toward personalised medicine.

The aberrant methylation pattern of genes as a diagnostic biomarker can serve as a practical option for timely detection and contribute subsequently to the enhancement of survival rate in CRC patients, since methylation changes are not only frequent but also can occur in initial tumorogenesis stages. It has been indicated that EDNRB and KISS1 genes are hypermethylated through progression and development of CRC. In current study, after extraction of genomic DNA from 45 paired tumor and adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples and treatment with bisulfite conversion, the methylation status of EDNRB and KISS1 CpG rich regions were assessed quantitatively using MS-HRM assay to determine practicability of these aberrant methylations for diagnosis of sporadic CRC and its discrimination from corresponding normal tissues. The results showed that the methylation distribution differences, comparing tumor tissues with their adjacent non-cancerous tissues, were statistically significant in all selected locations within EDNRB gene promoter (P &lt; 0.001); they had also some correlations with tumor stage and grade. Nonetheless, methylation distribution in KISS1 gene CpG rich region revealed no statistically significant differences between CRC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P = 0.060).

Expression of Her-2, Ki-67, p53 and clinical characteristics of 260 breast cancer patients were retrospectively studied. Her-2 overexpression led to higher incidence rates of infiltrating ductal carcinoma and axillary lymph node metastasis, bigger diameters of the primary tumors, later pTNM staging, and a lower incidence rate of ductal carcinoma in situ (p &lt; 0.05). High expression of ER and PR led to fewer patients classified histologically in higher grade (p = 0.001), while high expression of Ki-67 and p53 caused more patients classified histologically in higher grade (p = 0.001). In patients histologically classified in grade 1 and 2, the expression of Ki-67 and p53 was significantly (p = 0.001) higher, and the expression of ER and PR was significantly lower, in Her-2 positive patients than Her-2 negative patients. Breast cancer with Her-2 overexpression was more likely to recur and metastasize than Her-2 negative breast cancer. Higher coincidence of high expression of p53 and Ki-67 with Her-2 overexpression and more progressed tumors suggested that in addition to p53, Ki-67 might also be a prognostic biomarker of breast cancer.","2167":"The genetic engineering of plants offers a revolutionary advance for crop improvement, and the incorporation of transgenes into crop species can impart new traits that would otherwise be difficult to obtain through conventional breeding.

Search of some online electronic databases was conducted to identify available studies. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and analyzed. Finally, 18 eligible studies with 791 cervical cancer patients, 1,013 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions, 199 normal cervical tissues, and 95 samples with chronic cervicitis were identified in this analysis. The pooled OR of survivin expression was found to be significantly higher in the samples from cervical cancer than in those from CIN lesions, normal cervical tissues, and chronic cervicitis. When cervical cancer was compared to CIN lesions, the subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that survivin expression was associated with a risk of cervical cancer in Asians (P &lt; 0.001), but not in Caucasians (P = 0.659). In addition, survivin was significantly more overexpressed in high-grade cervical cancer than in low-grade cervical cancer. Its expression was also more elevated in advanced-stage patients than in early-stage patients, in lymph node metastasis than in lymph node without metastasis, and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) than in adenocarcinoma (AC). The expression of survivin may play a key role in the carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis of cervical cancer. However, survivin expression may be involved in the progression of CIN lesions only in the Asian population. Survivin expression is associated with an increased risk of SCC.

Cell cycle distribution, collagen counts, and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1\/2) (p - ERK1\/2) expression were assessed by flow cytometry, VG staining, and immunocytochemistry, respectively. The Ang II group had a much higher proportion of cells in the S-phase, higher collagen contents, and a higher p - ERK1\/2 expression level than either the control or testosterone group. However, these factors were significantly reduced in the testosterone + Ang II group as compared to the Ang II group. In terms of cells in the S-phase and the collagen contents, there was not a significant difference between the testosterone group and the control. However, the protein expression of p-ERK1\/2 was significantly increased in the testosterone group as compared to the control.

Protein engineers mimic these natural processes in vitro to create chimeras with altered properties or novel functions by swapping modules between different parental genes. Most domain swapping efforts are realized with traditional restriction and ligation techniques, which become particularly restrictive when either a large number of variants, or variants of proteins with multiple domains have to be constructed.

The p60 protein (Lm-p60) is an NlpC\/P60-containing peptidoglycan hydrolase secreted by Listeria monocytogenes. The N-terminus of Lm-p60 contains 2 LysM modules separated by an SH3 module. Our recent study of Lm-p60 demonstrates that the N-terminal half of Lm-p60, comprised of 2 LysM and 1 SH3 module, is able to recognize and bind peptidoglycan. The LysM domain of Lm-p60 contains only 2 LysM modules, which is the minimum number of LysM modules in most NlpC\/P60-containing proteins, but it shows strong affinity for peptidoglycan. Moreover, these 2 LysM modules have only 38.64% similarity to each other.

EN responses to Kiwi samples were measured and analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and stochastic resonance (SR) methods. SAWR frequency eigen values were also measured to predict freshness. Kiwi fruit sample's weight loss index and human sensory evaluation were examined to characteristic its quality and freshness. Kiwi fruit's quality predictive models based on EN, SAWR, and EN combined with SAWR were developed, respectively. Weight loss and human sensory evaluation results demonstrated that Kiwi fruit's quality decline and overall acceptance decrease during the storage. Experiment result indicated that the PCA method could qualitatively discriminate all Kiwi fruit samples with different storage time. Both SR and SAWR frequency analysis methods could successfully discriminate samples with high regression coefficients (R = 0.98093 and R = 0.99014, respectively). The validation experiment results showed that the mixed predictive model developed using EN combined with SAWR present higher quality prediction accuracy than the model developed either by EN or by SAWR. This method exhibits some advantages including high accuracy, non-destructive, low cost, etc. It provides an effective way for fruit quality rapid analysis.","2345":"Active recombinant proteins are used for studying the biological functions of genes and for the development of therapeutic drugs. Overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria often results in the formation of inclusion bodies, which are protein aggregates with non-native conformations. Protein refolding is an important process for obtaining active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies. However, the conventional refolding method of dialysis or dilution is time-consuming and recovered active protein yields are often low, and a cumbersome trial-and-error process is required to achieve success. To circumvent these difficulties, we used controllable diffusion through laminar flow in microchannels to regulate the denaturant concentration. This method largely aims at reducing protein aggregation during the refolding procedure. This Commentary introduces the principles of the protein refolding method using microfluidic chips and the advantage of our results as a tool for rapid and efficient recovery of active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies.

When the production of uric acid is increased either by elevated purine intake or by impaired kidney function, uric acid will accumulate in the blood (hyperuricemia). This increases the risk of gout, a disease described in humans for at least 1000 years. Many lower organisms, such as the yeast Arxula adeninivorans, possess the enzyme, urate oxidase that converts uric acid to 5-hydroxyisourate, thus preventing uric acid accumulation. We have examined the complete purine degradation pathway in A. adeninivorans and analyzed enzymes involved. Recombinant adenine deaminase, guanine deaminase, urate oxidase and endogenous xanthine oxidoreductase have been investigated as potential additives to degrade purines in the food.

Vector control through insecticides has been used worldwide; unfortunately, it is losing effectiveness due to spread of resistances. Control of mosquito-borne diseases through field-releases of genetically engineered mosquitoes is an innovative and now feasible approach. Genetically modified mosquitoes have already been released into the wild in some regions, and protocols for this release are on hand in others.

While vaccines are available, there is a requirement for novel vaccine strategies due to high strain variation and poor cross-protection. This requires a more detailed understanding of virus-host cell interactions to identify candidates for targeted virus attenuation. One key area of research in the positive sense RNA virus field, due to its central role in virus replication, is the induction of cellular membrane rearrangements by this class of viruses for the assembly of virus replication complexes. In our recent work, we identified the structures induced by IBV during infection of cultured cells, as well as primary cells and ex vivo organ culture. We identified structures novel to the coronavirus family, which strongly resemble replication sites of other positive sense RNA viruses.

In this study we report further genetic modifications to Escherichia coli LS5218 in order to increase the lactic acid (LA) fraction in poly(lactic acid-co-3-hydroxyalkanoate) P(LA-co-HA) copolymers. Deletion of the pflA gene resulted in increased content of LA repeating units in the copolymers by over 3-fold compared with the wild type; however, this increase was offset by reduced yields in cell mass. Additionally, when acetate was used as a feedstock LA monomer incorporation reached 18.5 (mol%), which suggests that acetate can be used as a feedstock for the production of P(LA-co-HA) copolymers by E. coli. ","2359":"Bovine chymosin is an important milk-clotting agent used in the manufacturing of cheeses. Currently, the production of recombinant proteins by genetically modified organisms is widespread, leading to greatly reduced costs. Lactococcus (L.) lactis, the model lactic acid bacterium, was considered a good candidate for heterologous chymosin production for the following reasons: (1) it is considered to be a GRAS (generally regarded as safe) microorganism, (2) only one protease is present on its surface, (3) it can secrete proteins of different sizes, and (4) it allows for the direct production of protein in fermented food products. Thus, three genetically modified L. lactis strains were constructed to produce and target the three different forms of bovine chymosin, prochymosin B, chymosin A and chymosin B to the extracellular medium. Although all three proteins were stably produced in L. lactis, none of the forms were detected in the extracellular medium or showed clotting activity in milk. Our hypothesis is that this secretion deficiency and lack of clotting activity can be explained by the recombinant protein being attached to the cell envelope. Thus, the development of other strategies is necessary to achieve both production and targeting of chymosin in L. lactis, which could facilitate the downstream processing and recovery of this industrially important protein.

We found over production of phytol in Nostoc punctiforme by expressing a 2-Methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) synthase gene. MBO synthase catalyzes the conversion of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) into MBO, a volatile hemiterpene alcohol, in Pinus sabiniana. The result of enhanced phytol production in N. punctiforme, instead of MBO, could be explained by one of the 2 models: either the presence of a native prenyltransferase enzyme with a broad substrate specificity, or appropriation of a MBO synthase metabolic intermediate by a native geranyl diphosphate (GDP) synthase. In this work, an expression vector with an indigenous petE promoter for gene expression in the cyanobacterium N. punctiforme was constructed and MBO synthase gene expression was successfully shown using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and SDS-PAGE. Gas chromatography--mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) was performed to confirm phytol production from the transgenic N. punctiforme strains.

These toxic byproducts inhibited bacterial growth and killed bacterial cells and also inhibited growth of S. paradoxus NBRC 0259-3. We discovered that adjusting the pH of the culture supernatant or the culture medium containing the toxic byproducts to 6.0 attenuated the toxicity toward both bacteria and yeast, and also extended the period of viability of the bacterium. Although continuous adjustment of pH to 6.0 failed to improve the ethanol productivity of this ethanologenic bacterium, this pH adjustment worked very well in the two-step fermentation due to the attenuation of toxicity toward S. paradoxus NBRC 0259-3. These findings provide information critical for establishment of a practical system for ethanol production from brown macroalgae. ","2399":"Renewable lignocellulosic plant biomass is a promising feedstock from which to produce biofuels, chemicals, and materials. One approach to cost-effectively exploit this resource is to use consolidating bioprocessing (CBP) microbes that directly convert lignocellulose into valuable end products. Because many promising CBP-enabling microbes are non-cellulolytic, recent work has sought to engineer them to display multi-cellulase containing minicellulosomes that hydrolyze biomass more efficiently than isolated enzymes. In this review, we discuss progress in engineering the surfaces of the model microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We compare the distinct approaches used to display cellulases and minicellulosomes, as well as their surface enzyme densities and cellulolytic activities. Thus far, minicellulosomes have only been grafted onto the surfaces of B. subtilis and S. cerevisiae, suggesting that the absence of an outer membrane in fungi and Gram-positive bacteria may make their surfaces better suited for displaying the elaborate multi-enzyme complexes needed to efficiently degrade lignocellulose. ","2400":"Previous studies have examined different strategies for siRNA delivery with varying degrees of success. These include use of viral vectors, cationic liposomes, and polymers. Several copolymers were designed and synthesized based on blocks of poly(ethylene glycol) PEG, poly(propylene glycol) PPG, and poly(l-lysine). These were designated as P1, P2, and P3. We studied the copolymer self-assembly, siRNA binding, particle size, surface potential, architecture of the complexes, and siRNA delivery. Silencing of GFP using copolymer P3 to deliver GFP-specific siRNA to Neuro-2a cells expressing GFP was almost as effective as using Lipofectamine 2000, with minimal cytotoxicity. Thus, we have provided a new copolymer platform for siRNA delivery that we can continue to modify for improved delivery of siRNA in vitro and eventually in vivo. ","2401":"Whole cell biotransformation systems with enzyme cascading increasingly find application in biocatalysis to complement or replace established chemical synthetic routes for production of, e.g., fine chemicals. Recently, we established an Escherichia coli whole cell biotransformation system for reductive amination by coupling a transaminase and an amino acid dehydrogenase with glucose catabolism for cofactor recycling. Transformation of 2-keto-3-methylvalerate to l-isoleucine by E. coli cells was improved by genetic engineering of glucose metabolism for improved cofactor regeneration. Here, we compare this system with different strategies for cofactor regeneration such as cascading with alcohol dehydrogenases, with alternative production hosts such as Pseudomonas species or Corynebacterium glutamicum, and with improving whole cell biotransformation systems by metabolic engineering of NADPH regeneration. ","2402":"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a class of powerful machine learning models for classification and function approximation which have analogs in nature. An ANN learns to map stimuli to responses through repeated evaluation of exemplars of the mapping. This learning approach results in networks which are recognized for their noise tolerance and ability to generalize meaningful responses for novel stimuli. It is these properties of ANNs which make them appealing for applications to bioinformatics problems where interpretation of data may not always be obvious, and where the domain knowledge required for deductive techniques is incomplete or can cause a combinatorial explosion of rules. In this paper, we provide an introduction to artificial neural network theory and review some interesting recent applications to bioinformatics problems. ","2403":"Biotin is an essential cofactor of carboxylase enzymes in all kingdoms of life. The vitamin is produced by many prokaryotes, certain fungi, and plants. Animals depend on biotin uptake from their diet and in humans lack of the vitamin is associated with serious disorders. Many aspects of biotin metabolism, uptake, and intracellular transport remain to be elucidated. In order to characterize the activity of novel biotin transporters by a sensitive assay, an Escherichia coli strain lacking both biotin synthesis and its endogenous high-affinity biotin importer was constructed. This strain requires artificially high biotin concentrations for growth. When only trace levels of biotin are available, it is viable only if equipped with a heterologous high-affinity biotin transporter. This feature was used to ascribe transport activity to members of the BioY protein family in previous work. Here we show that this strain together with its parent is also useful as a diagnostic tool for wide-concentration-range bioassays. ","2404":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows high growth activity under low pH conditions and can be used for producing acidic chemicals such as organic acids as well as fuel ethanol. However, ethanol can also be a problematic by-product in the production of chemicals except for ethanol. We have reported that a stable low-ethanol production phenotype was achieved by disrupting 6 NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase genes of S. cerevisiae. Moreover, the genes encoding the NADH-dependent glycerol biosynthesis enzymes were further disrupted because the ADH-disrupted recombinant strain showed high glycerol production to maintain intracellular redox balance. The recombinant strain incapable producing ethanol and glycerol could have the potential to be a host for producing metabolite(s) whose biosynthesis is coupled with NADH oxidation. Indeed, we successfully achieved almost 100% yield for L-lactate production using this recombinant strain as a host. In addition, the potential of our constructed recombinant strain for efficient bioproduction, particularly under anaerobic conditions, is also discussed.

Here, a biological system is defined as a set of self-organized, differentiated elements that interact pair-wise through various networks and media, isolated from other sets by boundaries. Their relation to other systems can be described as a closed loop in a steady-state, which leads to a hierarchical structure and functioning of the biological system. Our thermodynamical approach of hierarchical character can be applied to biological systems of varying sizes through some general principles, based on the exchange of energy information and\/or mass from and within the systems. ","2407":"Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) is a probiotic yeast related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) but with distinct genetic, taxonomic and metabolic properties. S. cerevisiae has been used extensively in biotechnological applications. Currently, many strains are available, and multiple genetic tools have been developed, which allow the expression of several exogenous proteins of interest with applications in the fields of medicine, biofuels, the food industry, and scientific research, among others. Although S. boulardii has been widely studied due to its probiotic properties against several gastrointestinal tract disorders, very few studies addressed the use of this yeast as a vector for expression of foreign genes of interest with biotechnological applications. Here we show that, despite the similarity of the two yeasts, not all genetic tools used in S. cerevisiae can be applied in S. boulardii. While transformation of the latter could be obtained using a commercial kit developed for the former, consequent screening of successful transformants had to be optimized. We also show that several genes frequently used in genetic manipulation of S. cerevisiae (e.g., promoters and resistance markers) are present in S. boulardii. Sequencing revealed a high rate of homology (&gt; 96%) between the orthologs of the two yeasts. However, we also observed some of them are not eligible to be targeted for transformation of S. boulardii. This work has important applications toward the potential of this probiotic yeast as an expression system for genes of interest. ","2408":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses numerous advantageous biological features, such as being robust, easily handled, mostly non-pathogenic and having high catabolic rates, etc., which can be considered as merits for being used as a promising biocatalyst in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for electricity generation. Previous studies have developed efficient MFC configurations to convert metabolic electron shuttles, such as cytoplasmic NADH, into usable electric current. However, no studies have elucidated the maximum potential of S. cerevisiae for current output and the underlying metabolic pathways, resulting from the interaction of thousands of reactions inside the cell during MFC operation. To address these two key issues, this study used in silico metabolic engineering techniques, flux balance analysis (FBA), and flux variability analysis with target flux minimization (FATMIN), to model the metabolic perturbation of S. cerevisiae under the MFC-energy extraction. The FBA results showed that, in the cytoplasmic NADH-dependent mediated electron transfer (MET) mode, S. cerevisiae had a potential to produce currents at up to 5.781 A\/gDW for the anaerobic and 6.193 A\/gDW for the aerobic environments. The FATMIN results showed that the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms are resilient, relying on six and five contributing reactions respectively for high current production. Two reactions, catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD) (EC 1.4.1.3) and methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NAD) (EC 1.5.1.5), were shared in both current-production modes and contributed to over 80% of the identified maximum current outputs. It is also shown that the NADH regeneration was much less energy costly than biomass production rate. Taken together, our finding suggests that S. cerevisiae should receive more research effort for MFC electricity production.

As the next step, antibody-based therapeutics will be bioengineered in a way that they not only bind pathogenic targets but also address other issues, including drug targeting and delivery. For antibodies that are expected to act within brain tissue, like those that are directed against the pathogenic prion protein isoform, one of the major obstacles is the blood-brain barrier which prevents efficient transfer of the antibody, even of the engineered single-chain variants. We recently demonstrated that a specific prion-specific antibody construct which was injected into the murine tail vein can be efficiently transported into brain tissue. The novelty of the work was in that the cell penetrating peptide was used as a linker connecting both specificity-determining domains of the antibody peptide, thus eliminating the need for the standard flexible linker, composed of an arrangement of three consecutive (Gly 4Ser) repeats. This paves the road toward improved bioengineered antibody variants that target brain antigens.

To overcome the antigenic diversity of H5N1 strains, multiple vaccine strains can be designed based on the distribution of neutralizing epitopes in the globular head of H5 hemagglutinin (HA). Recently, we selected two different HAs of H5N1 strains based on the neutralizing epitopes and reactivity with different neutralizing antibodies. The HAs of selected vaccine strains were individually expressed on the baculovirus envelope (bivalent-BacHA) with its native antigenic configuration. Further, oral delivery of live bivalent-BacHA elicited broadly reactive humoral, mucosal and cell-mediated immune responses and showed complete protection against antigenically distinct H5N1 strains in mice. The strategy for the vaccine strain selection, vaccine design and route of administration will provide an idea for development of a widely protective vaccine against highly pathogenic H5N1 for pre-pandemic preparedness.

However, substantiated concerns have been raised with regard to quality and safety of animal tissue-extracted collagen, particularly in relation to its immunogenicity, risk of disease transmission and overall quality and consistency. In parallel, contamination with undesirable cellular factors can significantly impair its bioactivity, vis-a-vis its impact on cell recruitment, proliferation and differentiation. High-scale production of recombinant human collagen Type I (rhCOL1) in the tobacco plant provides a source of an homogenic, heterotrimeric, thermally stable \"virgin\" collagen which self assembles to fine homogenous fibrils displaying intact binding sites and has been applied to form numerous functional scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In addition, rhCOL1 can form liquid crystal structures, yielding a well-organized and mechanically strong membrane, two properties indispensable to extracellular matrix (ECM) mimicry. Overall, the shortcomings of animal- and cadaver-derived collagens arising from their source diversity and recycled nature are fully overcome in the plant setting, constituting a collagen source ideal for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

Several different strategies have been explored to improve both antigen and antibody production, all of them depending on a successful expression and immunogenicity of the antigen. Gene fusion technology attempted to address these challenges: fusion partners have been applied to optimize recombinant antigen production in E. coli, and to increase protein immunogenicity. Taking a 12-kDa surface adhesion antigen from Cryptosporidium parvum (CP12) by example, the novel H fusion partner was presented in this work as an attractive option for the development of recombinant immunogens and its adjuvant-free immunization. The H tag (of only 1 kDa) efficiently triggered a CP12-specific immune response, and it also improved the immunization procedure without requiring co-administration of adjuvants. Moreover, polyclonal antibodies raised against the HCP12 fusion antigen detected native antigen structures displayed on the surface of C. parvum oocysts. The H tag proved to be an advanced strategy and promising technology for the diagnosis and therapy of C. parvum infections in animals and humans, allowing a rapid and simple recombinant production of the CP12 antigen.

Due to their antioxidant properties they also have been widely recognized for their benefit on human health. Traditionally, such compounds are extracted from their natural plant sources, but this approach is limited by low abundance and environmental, seasonal as well as regional variations in yield. Chemical synthesis is not a true alternative for the large scale production of more complex phenylpropanoid-derived substances since chemical synthesis becomes commercially unfeasible as the structural complexity of these plant natural products increases. In the last years, many biosynthetic pathways for plant natural products have been elucidated through the advancements in DNA sequencing technologies. In combination with new recombinant DNA technologies this technical progress opens the door toward the functional integration of full biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of phenylpropanoids and phenylpropanoid-derived compounds in microorganisms. We believe that this approach has great potential to provide sufficient quantities of the desired plant natural product from cheap and renewable resources.

In order to increase our understanding on the role of MCRA in bifidobacteria we created and analyzed an insertion mutant of the MCRA-encoding gene of B. breve NCFB 2258. Our results demonstrate that the MCRA protein of B. breve NCFB 2258 does not appear to play a role in CLA production, yet is an oleate hydratase, which contributes to bifidobacterial solvent stress protection.

The enzyme production rate and yield are the main factors to consider when choosing the appropriate expression system for the production of recombinant proteins. Recombinant enzymes have been expressed in bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria), filamentous fungi (e.g., Aspergillus) and yeasts (e.g., Pichia pastoris). The favorable and very advantageous characteristics of these species have resulted in an increasing number of biotechnological applications. Bacterial hosts (e.g., E. coli) can be used to quickly and easily overexpress recombinant enzymes; however, bacterial systems cannot express very large proteins and proteins that require post-translational modifications. The main bacterial expression hosts, with the exception of lactic acid bacteria and filamentous fungi, can produce several toxins which are not compatible with the expression of recombinant enzymes in food and drugs. However, due to the multiplicity of the physiological impacts arising from high-level expression of genes encoding the enzymes and expression hosts, the goal of overproduction can hardly be achieved, and therefore, the yield of recombinant enzymes is limited. In this review, the recent strategies used for the high-level expression of microbial enzymes in the hosts mentioned above are summarized and the prospects are also discussed.

Conventional expression vectors are severely affected by the chromatin environment surrounding their integration site into the host genome, resulting in low expression levels and transgene silencing.

Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) are cloning vectors capable of accommodating up to 350 Kb. Thus, BACs can carry a whole eukaryotic locus with all the elements controlling the expression of a gene; therefore, BACs harbor their own chromatin environment. Expression vectors based on BACs containing open\/permissive chromatin loci are not affected by the chromatin surrounding their integration site in the host cell genome. Consequently, BAC-based expression vectors containing the appropriate loci confer predictable and high levels of expression over time.

When such elements are combined they act in a manner consistent with their individual behavior, as long as they affect different functions, such as transcription and translation. Interestingly, sequence context does not seem to influence the final outcome significantly. Expression of reporter gene bla could be increased up to 75 times at the protein level by combining three variants in one cassette.

Therefore, it is also necessary to produce ethanol from other specific carbohydrate components of seaweeds, including sulfated polysaccharides, mannitol, alginate, agar and carrageenan. This review summarizes the current state of research on the production of ethanol from seaweed carbohydrates for which the conversion of carbohydrates to sugars is a key step and makes comparisons with the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. This review provides valuable information necessary for the production of high concentrations of ethanol from seaweeds.

Biodiesel production based on microbial fermentation aiming to establish more efficient, less-cost and sustainable biodiesel production strategies is under current investigation by various start-up biotechnology companies and research centers. Genetic engineering plays a key role in the transformation of microbes into the desired cell factories with high efficiency of biodiesel production. Here, we present an overview of principal microorganisms used in the microbial biodiesel production and recent advances in metabolic engineering for the modification required. Overexpression or deletion of the related enzymes for de novo synthesis of biodiesel is highlighted with relevant examples. ","2447":"For decades, computer scientists have looked to nature for biologically inspired solutions to computational problems; ranging from robotic control to scheduling optimization. Paradoxically, as we move deeper into the post-genomics era, the reverse is occurring, as biologists and bioinformaticians look to computational techniques, to solve a variety of biological problems. One of the most common biologically inspired techniques are genetic algorithms (GAs), which take the Darwinian concept of natural selection as the driving force behind systems for solving real world problems, including those in the bioinformatics domain. Herein, we provide an overview of genetic algorithms and survey some of the most recent applications of this approach to bioinformatics based problems.

The parasite is a major cause of human disease in impoverished communities where it is transmitted to humans from pigs which act as intermediate hosts. Vaccination of pigs to prevent transmission of T. solium to humans is an approach that has been investigated to control the disease. A recombinant vaccine antigen, TSOL18, has been remarkably successful at reducing infection of pigs with T. solium in several experimental challenge trials. The vaccine has been shown to eliminate transmission of naturally acquired T. solium in a field trial conducted in Africa. We recently reported that the vaccine was also effective in a field trial conducted in Peru. The TSOL18 recombinant antigen for each of these trials has been produced by expression in Escherichia coli. Here we discuss research that has been undertaken on the TSOL18 antigen and related antigens with a focus on improved methods of preparation of recombinant TSOL18 and optimized expression in Escherichia coli. ","2451":"Production of recombinant proteins for use as pharmaceuticals, so-called biopharmaceuticals, is a multi-billion dollar industry. Many different cell factories are used for the production of biopharmaceuticals, but the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important cell factory as it is used for production of several large volume products. Insulin and insulin analogs are by far the dominating biopharmaceuticals produced by yeast, and this will increase as the global insulin market is expected to grow from USD12B in 2011 to more than USD32B by 2018. Other important biopharmaceuticals produced by yeast are human serum albumin, hepatitis vaccines and virus like particles used for vaccination against human papillomavirus. Here is given a brief overview of biopharmaceutical production by yeast and it is discussed how the secretory pathway can be engineered to ensure more efficient protein production. The involvement of directed metabolic engineering through the integration of tools from genetic engineering, systems biology and mathematical modeling, is also discussed. ","2452":"Therapeutic properties of recombinant proteins are very often affected by the composition and heterogeneity of their glycans. Conventional expression systems for recombinant pharmaceutical proteins typically do not address this problem and produce a mixture of glycoforms that are neither identical to human glycans nor optimized for enhanced efficacy. In terms of glycosylation, plants offer certain advantages over mammalian cells as the N-glycosylation pathway of plants is comparably simple and a typical mammalian O-glycosylation pathway is not present at all. During the last ten years we have developed a plant-based expression platform for the generation of recombinant glycoproteins with defined N-glycans. Now we have extended our tool-box for glyco-engineering in the tobacco related species Nicotiana benthamiana toward the production of tailored mucin-type O-glycans on recombinant proteins. ","2453":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder which affects the central nervous system. Multiple sclerosis treatment has traditionally focused on preventing inflammatory damage to the myelin sheath. Indeed, all currently available disease modifying agents are immunomodulators. However, the limitations of this approach are becoming increasingly clear, leading to the exploration of other potential therapeutic strategies. In particular, targeting the endogenous remyelination system to promote replacement of the lost myelin sheath has shown much promise. As our understanding of remyelination biology advances, the realization of a remyelinating therapeutic comes closer to fruition. In our review, we aim to summarize the limitations of the current immune focused treatment strategy and discuss the potential of remyelination as a new treatment method. Finally, we aim to highlight the challenges in the identification and development of such therapeutics.","2454":"We recently assessed the metabolism of Synechocystis sp PCC6803 through a constraints-based reconstruction and analysis approach and identified its main metabolic properties. These include reduced metabolic robustness, in contrast to a high photosynthetic robustness driving the optimal autotrophic metabolism. Here, we address how these metabolic features affect biotechnological capabilities of this bacterium. The search for growth-coupled overproducer strains revealed that the carbon flux re-routing, but not the electron flux, is significantly more challenging under autotrophic conditions than under mixo- or heterotrophic conditions. We also found that the blocking of the light-driven metabolism was required for carbon flux re-routing under mixotrophic conditions. Overall, our analysis, which represents the first systematic evaluation of the biotechnological capabilities of a photosynthetic organism, paradoxically suggests that the light-driven metabolism itself and its unique metabolic features are the main bottlenecks in harnessing the biotechnological potential of Synechocystis.","2455":"The ascomycete Ophiostoma piceae produces a sterol esterase (OPE) with high affinity toward p-nitrophenol, glycerol, and sterol esters. Recently, this enzyme has been heterologously expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris under the AOX1 methanol-inducible promoter (PAOX1) using sorbitol as co-susbtrate, and the hydrolytic activity of the recombinant protein (OPE*) turned out to be improved from a kinetic point of view. In this study, we analyze the effects of sorbitol during the expression of OPE*, at first added as an additional carbon source, and methanol as inducer. The O. piceae enzyme was successfully used for PVAc hydrolysis, suggesting its potential applicability in recycled paper production to decrease stickies problems.

Cell culture data demonstrated that LIVP6.1.1 efficiently infected and destroyed all four tested canine cancer cell lines. In two different xenograft models on the basis of the canine soft tissue sarcoma STSA-1 and the prostate carcinoma DT08\/40 cell lines, a systemic administration of the LIVP6.1.1 virus was found to be safe and led to anti-tumor and immunological effects resulting in the significant reduction of tumor growth in comparison to untreated control mice. In summary, the pre-clinical evaluation has demonstrated the efficacy of LIVP6.1.1 for canine cancer therapy. Furthermore, a clinical trial with canine cancer patients has already been started.","2462":"Recombinant vaccine antigens are being evaluated for their ability to protect livestock animals against cysticercosis and related parasitic infections. Practical use of some of these vaccines is expected to reduce parasite transmission, leading to a reduction in the incidence of neurocysticercosis and hydatid disease in humans. We recently showed that an antigen (TSOL16), expressed in Escherichia coli, confers high levels of protection against Taenia solium cysticercosis in pigs, which provides a strategy for control of T. solium parasite transmission. Here, we discuss the characteristics of this antigen that may affect the utility of TSOL16 and related antigens for development as recombinant vaccines. We also report that genes encoding antigens closely related to TSOL16 from T. solium also occur in other related species of parasites. These highly homologous antigens have the potential to be used as vaccines and may provide protection against related species of Taenia that cause infection in other hosts.","2463":"Malaria is an infectious disease that threatens half of the world's population. This debilitating disease is caused by infection from parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Insecticides, bed nets and drug therapies have lowered the prevalence and death rate associated with malaria but this disease continues to plague many populations around the world. In recent years, many organizations have suggested developing methods for a complete eradication of malaria. The most straightforward and effective method for this potential eradication will be through the development of a low-cost vaccine. To achieve eradication, it will be necessary to develop new vaccine candidates and novel systems for both the production and delivery of these vaccines. Recently, the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been used for the recombinant expression of malaria vaccine candidates including the transmission blocking vaccine candidate Pfs48\/45. Here, we discuss the potential of this research on the future development of a low-cost malaria vaccine candidate.","2464":"Papain-like cysteine proteases of malaria parasites are considered important chemotherapeutic targets or valuable models for the evaluation of drug candidates. Consequently, many of these enzymes have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli for their biochemical characterization. However, their expression has been problematic, showing low yield and leading to the formation of insoluble aggregates. Given that highly-productive expression systems are required for the high-throughput evaluation of inhibitors, we analyzed the existing expression systems to identify the causes of such apparent issues. We found that significant divergences in codon and nucleotide composition from host genes are the most probable cause of expression failure, and propose several strategies to overcome these limitations. Finally we predict that yeast hosts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris may be better suited than E. coli for the efficient expression of plasmodial genes, presumably leading to soluble and active products reproducing structural and functional characteristics of the natural enzymes.","2465":"The baculovirus\/insect cell system has proven to be a powerful tool for the expression of eukaryotic proteins. Therapeutics, especially in the field of vaccinology, are often composed of several different protein subunits. Conventional baculoviral expression schemes largely lack efficient strategies for simultaneous multi-gene expression. The MultiBac technology which is based on an engineered genome of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus in combination with specially designed transfer vectors is an elegant way for flexible generation of multi-subunit proteins in insect cells. Yet, the glycosylation pattern of insect cell-derived products is not favorable for many applications. Therefore, a modified version of MultiBac, SweetBac, was generated allowing for a flexible glycosylation of target proteins in insect cells. Beyond the SweetBac technology MultiBac can further be designed for bridging the gap between cell engineering and transient modulation of host genes for improved and product tailored expression of recombinant proteins.","2466":null,"2467":"Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) has been widely used for in vivo study and preclinical therapy due to its ability to mediate long-term transgene expression, its lack of pathogenicity and low immunogenicity. It has been found that AAV has more than ten serotypes, which each transfect certain types of cells in the viral infected organ. Current methods for purification of different AAV serotypes utilize CsCl or Iodixanol ultrahigh speed density gradient centrifugation, which is expensive and time consuming. We recently developed a simplified method, PEG\/(NH(4))(2)SO(4) aqueous two phase partitioning, for purification of AAV serotype 2 and 8. The method does not require ultrahigh speed gradient centrifugation or chromatography. Here we further explore the simplified method for purification of other serotypes of AAV, serotype 6 and 9. This simplified method not only can be used to purify serotype 2 and 8, but also serotype 6 and 9, indicating that a variety of AAV serotypes can be purified by this method.","2468":"Curiosity has driven humankind to explore and conquer space. However, today, space research is not a means to relieve this curiosity anymore, but instead has turned into a need. To support the crew in distant expeditions, supplies should either be delivered from the Earth, or prepared for short durations through physiochemical methods aboard the space station. Thus, research continues to devise reliable regenerative systems. Biological life support systems may be the only answer to human autonomy in outposts beyond Earth. For construction of an artificial extraterrestrial ecosystem, it is necessary to search for highly adaptable super-organisms capable of growth in harsh space environments. Indeed, a number of organisms have been proposed for cultivation in space. Meanwhile, some manipulations can be done to increase their photosynthetic potential and stress tolerance. Genetic manipulation and screening of plants, microalgae and cyanobacteria is currently a fascinating topic in space bioengineering. In this commentary, we will provide a viewpoint on the realities, limitations and promises in designing biological life support system based on engineered and\/or selected green organism. Special focus will be devoted to the engineering of key photosynthetic enzymes in pioneer green organisms and their potential use in establishment of transgenic photobioreactors in space.","2469":"Detection of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas cannabina pv alisalensis, the causal agent of bacterial blight of crucifers is essential for managing this disease. A phage-based diagnostic assay was developed that detects and identifies P. cannabina pv alisalensis from cultures and diseased plant specimens. A recombinant \"light-tagged\" reporter phage was generated by integrating the luxAB genes into the P. cannabina pv alisalensis phage PBSPCA1 genome. PBSPCA1::luxAB is viable, stable and detects P. cannabina pv alisalensis within minutes and with high sensitivity by conferring a bioluminescent signal. Detection is dependent on cell viability since cells treated with a bactericidal disinfectant are unable to elicit a signal. Importantly, the reporter phage detects P. cannabina pv alisalensis from diseased plant specimens indicating the potential of the diagnostic for disease identification. The reporter phage displays promise for the rapid and specific diagnostic detection of cultivated isolates, and infected plant specimens.","2470":"S100 proteins belong to a family of small, acidic, EF-hand Ca ( 2+) -binding proteins and have been found to exert both intracellular and extracellular functions in regulation of Ca ( 2+)  homeostasis, cytoskeletal dynamics, cell cycle, motility and differentiation. As a result, they have been widely investigated for their association with diseases, such as, neurological diseases, cardiomyopathy, neoplasias and inflammatory diseases. To facilitate further studies of S100 proteins, we reported a simple and efficient method for the expression and purification of human S100A4 and S100A11 proteins in Escherichia coli. Since S100 proteins share many common physical and chemical characteristics, we expect that this approach can be extended to the production of most S100 proteins.","2471":"Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), which integrates enzyme production, saccharification and fermentation into a one step process, is a promising strategy for the effective ethanol production from cheap lignocellulosic and starchy materials. CBP requires a highly engineered microbial strain able to both hydrolyze biomass with enzymes produced on its own and convert the resulting simple sugars into high-titer ethanol. Recently, heterologous production of cellulose and starch-degrading enzymes has been achieved in yeast hosts, which has realized direct processing of biomass to ethanol. However, essentially all efforts aimed at the efficient heterologous expression of saccharolytic enzymes in yeast have involved laboratory strains and much of this work has to be transferred to industrial yeasts that provide the fermentation capacity and robustness desired for large scale bioethanol production. Specifically, the development of an industrial CBP amylolytic yeast would allow the one-step processing of low-cost starchy substrates into ethanol. This article gives insight in the current knowledge and achievements on bioethanol production from starchy materials with industrial engineered S. cerevisiae strains.","2472":"The use of recombinant proteins has increased greatly in recent years, as have the number of techniques and materials used for their production and purification. The principal advantage of using plants as bioreactors is the cost of the recombinant protein production, which is about 1000-fold lower as in the case of using CHO cells commonly applied in industry today. Among the different types of \"green\" bioreactors being studied today, there is a general consensus among scientists that production in green plant tissues such as leaves is more feasible. However, the presence of chlorophyll and phenolic compounds in plant extracts, which can precipitate and denature the proteins besides damaging separation membranes and gels, makes this technology impracticable on a commercial scale. Electrochemically produced aluminium hydroxide gel can be used to adsorb these compounds, and pre-purify recombinant synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Removal efficiencies of 99.7% of chlorophyll, 88.5% of phenolic compounds, and 38.5% of native proteins from the N. benthamiana extracts were achieved without removing sGFP from the extracts. Since electrochemical preparation of aluminum hydroxide gel is a cost-effective technique, its use can substantially contribute to the development of future production platforms for recombinant proteins produced in green plant tissues of pharmaceutical and industrial interest.","2473":null,"2474":"The properties of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) can be manipulated by genetic engineering. Therefore, by the methods of gene engineering, Asp85 was replaced individually by two other amino acids (D85V, D85S).

Proton translocation was almost completely abrogated by the mutant D85S, while the D85V mutant was partially active in pumping protons. Compared with wild type, maximum absorption of the mutants, D85V and D85S, were 563 and 609 nm, which illustrated 5 nm reductions (blue shift) and 41 nm increases (red shift), respectively. Since proton transport activity and spectroscopic activities of the mutants are different, a wide variety of membrane bioreactors (MBr) have been developed. Modified proteins can be utilized to produce unique photo\/Electro-chromic materials and tools.","2475":"Radio-genetic therapy is a combination of radiation therapy and gene therapy that may solve some of the problems associated with conventional radiotherapy. A promoter responsive to radiation was obtained from a promoter library composed of DNA fragments created by linking the TATA box signal to randomly combined binding sequences of transcription factors that are reactive to radiation. Each promoter connected to the luciferase gene, was evaluated by luciferase expression enhancement in transfected cells after X-ray irradiation. The reactivity of the best promoter was improved by the random introduction of point mutations and the resultant promoter showed more than a 20-fold enhancement of the luciferase expression after X-ray irradiation at 10 Gy. The expression of downstream genes was also enhanced in stably transfected cells not only by X-rays but also by proton beam irradiation; and either enhancement was attenuated when an anti-oxidant was added, thus suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress in the promoter activation. Constructed promoters were also activated in tumors grown in mice. In addition, cell killing with the fcy::fur gene (a suicide gene converting 5-fluorocytosin to highly toxic 5-fluorouracil) increased dose-dependently with 5-fluorocytosin only after X-ray irradiation in vitro. These results suggest that promoters obtained through this method could be used for possible clinical applications.","2476":"Severely stressed, with their resources depleted, and their cellular machinery working beyond capacity, the host cells that are used for heterologous protein production have no option but to activate their stress response pathways in order to mitigate the accumulating effects of expressing a foreign, possibly toxic, protein at vast quantities. The result is lower protein yield and quality, with many products being misfolded or part of inclusion bodies that need further processing. Recently, new techniques aim to shift the control of protein production from humans to cells and empower the latter to regulate the production process, thus leading to increased protein quality. Herein we provide a perspective on how integrative synthetic biology can be applied to traditional biotechnological applications with potentially transformative results.","2477":"Nannochloropsis species have emerged as leading phototrophic microorganisms for the production of biofuels. Several isolates produce large quantities of triacylglycerols, grow rapidly, and can be cultivated at industrial scales. Recently, the mitochondrial, plastid and nuclear genomes of Nannochloropsis gaditana were sequenced. Genomic interrogation revealed several key features that likely facilitate the oleaginous phenotype observed in Nannochloropsis, including an over-representation of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis. Here we present additional analyses on gene orientation, vitamin B12 requiring enzymes, the acetyl-CoA metabolic node, and codon usage in N. gaditana. Nuclear genome transformation methods are established with exogenous DNA integration occurring via either random incorporation or by homologous recombination, making Nannochloropsis amenable to both forward and reverse genetic engineering. Completion of a draft genomic sequence, establishment of transformation techniques, and robust outdoor growth properties have positioned Nannochloropsis as a new model alga with significant potential for further development into an integrated photons-to-fuel production platform.","2478":"While the bacteriocin Nisin has been employed by the food industry for 60 y, it remains the only bacteriocin to be extensively employed as a food preservative. This is despite the fact that the activity of Nisin against several food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria is poor and the availability of many other bacteriocins with significant potential in this regard. An alternative route to address the deficiencies of Nisin is the application of bioengineered derivatives of the peptide which, despite differing only subtly, possess enhanced capabilities of commercial value. The career path which has taken me from learning for the first time what bacteriocins are to understanding the potential of bacteriocin bioengineering has been a hugely enjoyable experience and promises to get even more interesting in the years to come.","2479":null,"2480":"The influenza virus is a respiratory pathogen with a negative-sense, segmented RNA genome.

Two principal enzymes derived from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi are the only options clinically approved to date. We recently reported a study of recombinant L-asparaginase (AnsA) from Rhizobium etli and described an increasing type of AnsA family members. Sequence analysis revealed four conserved motifs with notable differences with respect to the conserved regions of amino acid sequences of type I and type II L-asparaginases, particularly in comparison with therapeutic enzymes from E. coli and E. chrysanthemi. These differences suggested a distinct immunological specificity. Here, we report an in silico analysis that revealed immunogenic determinants of AnsA. Also, we used an extensive approach to compare the crystal structures of E. coli and E. chrysantemi asparaginases with a computational model of AnsA and identified immunogenic epitopes. A three-dimensional model of AsnA revealed, as expected based on sequence dissimilarities, completely different folding and different immunogenic epitopes. This approach could be very useful in transcending the problem of immunogenicity in two major ways: by chemical modifications of epitopes to reduce drug immunogenicity, and by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues to diminish immunogenicity without reduction of enzymatic activity.","2483":null,"2484":"Sakuranetin, the major flavonoid phytoalexin in rice, can be induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, treatment with CuCl 2 or jasmonic acid (JA), or phytopathogenic infection. In addition to sakuranetin's biological significance on disease resistance in rice, its broad bioactivities have recently been described. Results from these studies have shown that sakuranetin is a useful compound as a plant antibiotic and a potential pharmaceutical agent. Sakuranetin is biosynthesized from naringenin, a precursor of sakuranetin, by naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT), but the relevant gene has not yet been identified in rice. Recently, we identified the OsNOMT gene, which is involved in the final step of sakuranetin biosynthesis in rice. In previous studies, OsNOMT was purified to apparent homogeneity from UV-treated wild-type rice leaves; however, the purified protein, termed OsCOMT1, exhibited caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity, but not NOMT activity. Based on the analysis of an oscomt1 T-DNA tagged mutant, we determined that OsCOMT1 did not contribute to sakuranetin production in rice in vivo. Therefore, we took advantage of the oscomt1 mutant to purify OsNOMT. A crude protein preparation from UV-treated oscomt1 leaves was subjected to three sequential purification steps resulting in a 400-fold purification from the crude enzyme preparation with a minor band at an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa in the purest enzyme preparation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time of flight\/time of flight analysis showed that the 40 kDa protein band included two O-methyltransferase-like proteins, but one of the proteins encoded by Os12g0240900 exhibited clear NOMT activity; thus, this gene was designated OsNOMT. Gene expression was induced by treatment with jasmonic acid in rice leaves prior to sakuranetin accumulation, and the recombinant protein showed reasonable kinetic properties to NOMT. Identification of the OsNOMT gene enables the production of large amounts of sakuranetin through transgenic rice and microorganisms. This finding also allows for the generation of disease-resistant and sakuranetin biofortified rice in the future.","2485":"Bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a model system in biotechnology, is a G-protein dependent trans membrane protein which serves as a light driven proton pump in the cell membrane of Halobacterium salinarum. Due to the linkage of retinal to the protein, it seems colored and has numbers of versatile properties. As in vitro culture of the Halobacteria is very difficult, and isolation is time consuming and usually inefficient, production of genetically modified constructs of the protein is essential. There are three important characteristics based on protein catalytic cycle and molecular functions of photo-electric, photochromic and proton transporting, which makes this protein as a strategic molecule with potential applications in biotechnology. Such applications include protein films, used in artificial retinal implants, light modulators, three-dimensional optical memories, color photochromic sensors, photochromic and electrochromic papers and ink, biological camouflage and photo detectors for biodefense and non-defense purposes.","2486":"Toxoplasmosis is a globally distributed foodborne zoonosis caused by a protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent humans, toxoplasmosis is a serious clinical and veterinary problem often leading to lethal damage in an infected host. In order to overcome the exceptionally strong clinical and socio-economic impact of Toxoplasma infection, the construction of an effective vaccine inducing full immunoprotection against the parasite is an urgent issue. In the last two decades many live attenuated, subunit and DNA-based vaccines against toxoplasmosis have been studied, however only partial protection conferred by vaccination against chronic as well as acute infection has been achieved. Among various immunization strategies, no viable subunit vaccines based on recombinant secretory (ROP2, ROP4 and GRA4) and surface (SAG1) T. gondii proteins have been found as attractive tools for further studies. This is due to their high, but still partial, protective efficacy correlated with the induction of cellular and humoral immune responses.","2487":"Recombinant protein fused to an N-terminal signal peptide can be translocated to the periplasm and, eventually, to the extracellular medium of Escherichia coli under specific conditions. In this communication, we described the use and optimization of a heterologous signal peptide (G1 signal peptide) from a Bacillus sp for improved recombinant protein secretion and cell viability in E. coli. Significant advantages in maintaining high cell viability and high specificity of target protein secretion were achieved by using G1 signal peptide compared to the well-known PelB signal peptide. Signal peptide sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of G1 signal peptide demonstrated that an 'MKK' sequence in n-region and the presence of a helix-breaking residue at the centre of h-region are important elements for the design of an optimal signal peptide.","2488":"Plants have been proved as a novel production platform for a wide range of biologically important compounds such as enzymes, therapeutic proteins, antibiotics, and proteins with immunological properties. In this context, plastid genetic engineering can be potentially used to produce recombinant proteins. However, several challenges still remain to be overcome if the full potential of plastid transformation technology is to be realized. They include the development of plastid transformation systems for species other than tobacco, the expression of transgenes in non-green plastids, the increase of protein accumulation and the appearance of pleiotropic effects. In this paper, we discuss the novel tools recently developed to overcome some limitations of chloroplast transformation.","2489":"Economically feasible production of second-generation biofuels requires efficient co-fermentation of pentose and hexose sugars in lignocellulosic hydrolysates under very harsh conditions. Baker's yeast is an excellent, traditionally used ethanol producer but is naturally not able to utilize pentoses. This is due to the lack of pentose-specific transporter proteins and enzymatic reactions. Thus, natural yeast strains must be modified by genetic engineering. Although the construction of various recombinant yeast strains able to ferment pentose sugars has been described during the last two decades, their rates of pentose utilization is still significantly lower than D-glucose fermentation. Moreover, pentoses are only fermented after D-glucose is exhausted, resulting in an uneconomical increase in the fermentation time. In this addendum, we discuss novel approaches to improve utilization of pentoses by development of specific transporters and substrate channeling in enzyme cascades.","2490":"Nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) have inter-related and distinct impacts on microalgal metabolism; with N starvation having previously been reported to induce elevated levels of the biodiesel feedstock material triacylglycerol (TAG), while S deprivation is extensively studied for its effects on biohydrogen production in microalgae. ( 1)  (,)  ( 2)  We have previously demonstrated that N- and S-starved cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii display different metabolic trends, suggesting that different response mechanisms exist to compensate for the absence of those two elements. ( 3)  We used C. reinhardtii CC-124 mt(-) and CC-125 mt(+) strains to test possible metabolic changes related to TAG accumulation in response to N and S deprivation, considering that gamete differentiation in this organism is mainly regulated by N. ( 4)  Our findings contribute to the understanding of microalgal response to element deprivation and potential use of element deprivation for biodiesel feedstock production using microalgae, but much remains to be elucidated on the precise contribution of both N and S starvation on microalgal metabolism.","2491":"Affinity precipitation is a non-chromatographic method which is useful for purification and refolding of proteins. Quite often, a stimuli-sensitive polymer can be identified which selectively binds to the desired protein. For separation, the protein can be recovered from the precipitate of the protein-smart polymer complex. In case of a refolding experiment, binding of the solubilized protein (in its denatured form) with the polymer leads to the refolding of the protein.","2492":"N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), the monomer of chitin and constituent of bacterial peptidoglycan, is a preferred carbon and nitrogen source for streptomycetes. Recent studies have revealed new functions of GlcNAc in nutrient signaling of bacteria. Exposure to GlcNAc activates development and antibiotic production of Streptomyces coelicolor under poor growth conditions (famine) and blocks these processes under rich conditions (feast). Glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P) is a key molecule in this signaling pathway and acts as an allosteric effector of a pleiotropic transcriptional repressor DasR, the regulon of which includes the GlcNAc metabolic enzymes N-actetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P) deacetylase (NagA) and GlcN-6P deaminase (NagB). Intracellular accumulation of GlcNAc-6P and GlcN-6P enhanced production of the pigmented antibiotic actinorhodin. When the nagB mutant was challenged with GlcNAc or GlcN, spontaneous second-site mutations that relieved the toxicity of the accumulated sugar phosphates were obtained. Surprisingly, deletion of nagA also relieved toxicity of GlcN, indicating novel linkage between the GlcN and GlcNAc utilization pathways. The strongly enhanced antibiotic production observed for many suppressor mutants shows the potential of the modulation of GlcNAc and GlcN metabolism as a metabolic engineering tool toward the improvement of antibiotic productivity or even the discovery of novel compounds.","2493":"UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is an important sugar nucleotide used as a precursor of cell wall components in bacteria, and as a substrate in the synthesis of oligosaccharides in eukaryotes. In bacteria UDP-GlcNAc is synthesized from the glycolytic intermediate D-fructose-6-phosphate (fructose-6P) by four successive reactions catalyzed by three enzymes: glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (GlmS), phosphoglucosamine mutase (GlmM) and the bi-functional enzyme glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase\/ N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU). We have previously reported a metabolic engineering strategy in Lactobacillus casei directed to increase the intracellular levels of UDP-GlcNAc by homologous overexpression of the genes glmS, glmM and glmU. One of the most remarkable features regarding the production of UDP-GlcNAc in L. casei was to find multiple regulation points on its biosynthetic pathway: (1) regulation by the NagB enzyme, (2) glmS RNA specific degradation through the possible participation of a glmS riboswitch mechanism, (3) regulation of the GlmU activity probably by end product inhibition and (4) transcription of glmU.","2494":"Two limiting aspects are mainly responsible for the sluggish development of new cancer drugs. They concern the chemical properties of potential drug molecules and the structural prerequisites for drug targets. The chemical properties which are being considered desirable for potential drugs are rather restrictive and mainly dictated by the rules of oral availability. Drug target structures are mostly defined as molecules which comprise binding pockets for low molecular weight compounds. These low molecular weight compounds then serve as leads for the derivation of analogs which recognize the same site and which can function as competitive or irreversibly binding inhibitors. The extension of the range of drug targets and the design of suitable lead compounds will be one of the most challenging tasks for drug developers in the future. Such auxiliary drug target structures can be found in the complex networks of interacting proteins which constitute the intracellular signal transduction cascades. The transient assembly of high molecular weight complexes, based on the specific interactions of particular domains, and usually regulated by secondary modifications, propagates extracellular signals through the cytoplasm and into the nucleus. Aberrations in the formation of protein complexes, or in the regulation of their disassembly, often trigger pathological conditions. The interference with interactions of proteins or the interactions of proteins with DNA offer new opportunities for drug discovery and development. Protein complexes which are indispensable for the growth and survival of cancer cells, proteins to which these cells are \"addicted,\" appear most suited for such an approach. Stat3 and Survivin have been used as model proteins. Specific peptide ligands able to recognize and suppress the functions of crucial interaction surfaces of these proteins have been derived and shown to be able to induce cancer cell death. However, further technology development is required to turn such ligands into useful drugs. The technology comprises three steps: (1) the identification of a peptide ligand which specifically interacts with a crucial functional domain of a target protein, (2) the induction of a desired cellular phenotype upon intracellular interaction of the peptide ligand with its target structure and (3) the replacement of the peptide ligand with a functionally equivalent low molecular weight, drug like compound and its optimization through medicinal chemistry.","2495":"The Ca(2+)-dependent SOS pathway has emerged as a key mechanism in the homeostasis of Na(+) and K(+) under saline conditions. We recently identified and functionally characterized by complementation studies in yeast and Arabidopsis the gene encoding the calcineurin-interacting protein kinase of the SOS pathway in tomato, SlSOS2.(1) We also show evidences on the biotechnological potential of SlSOS2 conferring salt tolerance to transgenic tomato. The increased salinity tolerance of SlSOS2 overexpressing plants is associated with higher sodium content in stems and leaves. SlSOS2 overexpression upregulates the Na(+)\/H(+) exchange at the plasma membrane (SlSOS1) and K(+), Na(+)\/H(+) antiport at the endosomal and vacuolar compartments (LeNHX2 and LeNHX4). Therefore, SlSOS2 seems to be involved in tomato salinity tolerance through regulation of Na(+) extrusion from the root, active loading of Na(+) into the xylem and Na(+) and K(+) compartmentalization.","2496":"Resistance development against multiple drugs is a common feature among many pathogens--including bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, viruses, and parasites--and also among cancers. The reasons are two-fold. Most commonly-used rationally-designed small molecule drugs or monoclonal antibodies, as well as antibiotics, strongly inhibit a key single step in the growth and proliferation of the pathogen or cancer cells. The disease agents quickly change or switch off this single target, or activate the efflux mechanisms to pump out the drug, thereby becoming resistant to the drug. A second problem is the way drugs are designed. The pharmaceutical industry chooses to use, by high-throughput screening, compounds that are maximally inhibitory to the key single step in the growth of the pathogen or cancer, thereby promoting selective pressure. An ideal drug would be one that inhibits multiple steps in the disease progression pathways with less stringency in these steps. Low levels of inhibition at multiple steps provide cumulative strong inhibitory effect, but little incentives or ability on the part of the pathogen\/cancer to develop resistance. Such intelligent drug design involving multiple less stringent inhibitory steps is beyond the scope of the drug industry and requires evolutionary wisdom commonly possessed by bacteria. This review surveys assessments of the current clinical situation with regard to drug resistance in P. aeruginosa, and examines tools currently employed to limit this trend. We then provide a conceptual framework in which we explore the similarities between multi-drug resistance in pathogens and in cancers. We summarize promising work on anti-cancer drugs derived from the evolutionary wisdom of bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, and how such strategies can be the basis for how to look for candidate protein\/peptide antibiotic drugs from bioengineered bugs. Such multi-domain proteins, unlike diffusible antibiotics, are not diffusible because of their large size and are often released only on contact with the perceived competitor. Thus, multi-domain proteins are missed during traditional methods of looking for growth zone inhibition of susceptible bacteria as demonstrated by antibiotics, but may represent the weapons of the future in the fights against both drug-resistant cancers and pathogens such as P. aeruginosa.","2497":"Members of the genus Clostridium are of both medical and industrial importance. The molecular tools necessary to study and exploit their wide ranging physiological diversity through directed mutational analysis have until recently been lacking. The situation was transformed in the mid-2000s with the specific adaptation of intron re-targeting technology to the genus, through the development of the ClosTron. By making a handful of nucleotide changes to the group II intron encoding region, the intron can be directed to insert into almost any region within the genome. Through the use of a retrotransposition-activated marker (RAM), based on the ermB gene, successful insertion is selected on the basis of acquisition of resistance to erythromycin. The re-targeted region is designed using an online re-targeting algorithm (www.clostron.com), and then an order is placed with DNA2.0 for both the synthesis of the re-targeted region and its custom cloning into the ClosTron vector. Re-targeted ClosTrons are delivered ready for use in 10-14 days, allowing mutants to be isolated 5-7 days after receipt. Its availability has revolutionized clostridial molecular biology.","2498":"Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering is a technology which is used to make subtle changes in the chromosome of several bacterial genera. Cells which express a single-stranded DNA binding protein (RecT or Bet) are transformed with an oligonucleotide which is incorporated via an annealing and replication-dependent mechanism. By in silico analysis we identified ssDNA binding protein homologs in the genus Lactobacillus and Lactococcus lactis. To assess whether we could further improve the recombineering efficiency in Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 we expressed several RecT homologs in this strain. RecT derived from Enterococcus faecalis CRMEN 19 yielded comparable efficiencies compared with a native RecT protein, but none of the other proteins further increased the recombineering efficiency. We successfully improved recombineering efficiency 10-fold in L. lactis by increasing oligonucleotide concentration combined with the use of oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate-linkages (PTOs). Surprisingly, neither increased oligonucleotide concentration nor PTO linkages enhanced recombineering in L. reuteri 6475. To emphasize the utility of this technology in improving probiotic features we modified six bases in a transcriptional regulatory element region of the pdu-operon of L. reuteri 6475, yielding a 3-fold increase in the production of the antimicrobial compound reuterin. Directed genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria through ssDNA recombineering will simplify strain improvement in a way that, when mutating a single base, is genetically indistinguishable from strains obtained through directed evolution.","2499":"Protein production through dedicated secretion systems might offer an potential alternative to the conventional cytoplasmical expression. The application of Type 1 secretion systems of Gram-negative bacteria, however, where often not successful in the past for a wide range of proteins. Recently, two studies using the E. coli maltose binding protein (MalE) and the rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) revealed a rational to circumvent these limitations. Here, wild-type passenger proteins were not secreted, while folding mutants with decreased folding kinetics were efficiently exported to the extracellular space. Subsequently, an one-step purification protocol yielded homogeneous and active protein. Taken together, theses two studies suggest that the introduction of slow-folding mutations into a protein sequence might be the key to use Type 1 secretion systems for the biotechnological production of proteins.","2500":null,"2501":"","2502":"Heparin is the most widely used pharmaceutical to control blood coagulation in modern medicine. A health crisis that took place in 2008 led to a demand for production of heparin from non-animal sources. Since Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are capable of producing heparan sulfate (HS), a related polysaccharide naturally, and heparin and HS share the same biosynthetic pathway, we hypothesized that heparin could be produced in CHO cells by metabolic engineering. We developed stable human N-deacetylase\/N-sulfotransferase (NDST2) and mouse heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 1 (Hs3st1) expressing cell lines based on the expression of endogenous enzymes in the HS\/heparin pathways of CHO-S cells. Both activity assay and disaccharide analysis showed that engineered HS attained heparin-like characteristics but not identical to pharmaceutical heparin, suggesting that further balancing the expression of transgenes with the expression levels of endogenous enzymes involved in HS\/heparin biosynthesis might be necessary.","2503":"Baculovirus is extensively utilized as an excellent tool for production of recombinant protein in insect cells. Baculovirus infects insects in nature and is non-pathogenic to humans. In addition to insect cells, baculovirus is capable of transducing a broad range of animal cells. Due to its biosafety, large cloning capacity, low cytotoxicity, and non-replication nature in the transduced cells as well as the ease of manipulation and production, baculovirus has been utilized as RNA interference mediators, gene delivery vectors, and vaccine vectors for a wide variety of applications. This article focuses on the utilization of baculoviruses as vaccine vectors to prepare antigen or subunit vaccines.","2504":"Increased stress tolerance of economically important plants and microorganisms can improve yields in agriculture and industrial microbiology. The pool of resources used for the genetic modification of crops and industrial fungal strains in the past has been relatively limited, and has frequently included only stress-sensitive organisms. However, certain groups of fungi have evolved specialized mechanisms that enable them to thrive under even the most extreme of environmental conditions. These species can be considered as promising sources of biotechnologically interesting genes. Together with a powerful and convenient high-throughput functional screening method, extremotolerant fungi represent a new opportunity for the identification of stress-tolerance-conferring genes. The approaches described here should provide important contributions to the enhancing of the properties of economically important organisms in the future.","2505":"","2506":"The ability to generate tailor-made, functionalized polyester (polyhydroxyalkanoate, PHA) beads in bacteria by harnessing their natural carbon-storage granule production system is an exciting recent development. Proteins that naturally attach to the polyester granule core were rationally engineered to enable in vivo production of PHA beads which are applicable in bioseparation, protein purification, enzyme immobilization and diagnostics and which show advantageous properties toward the development of safe and efficient particulate vaccines. These beads are recombinantly produced as fully functional, insoluble polyester inclusions that can be easily separated from the cell. This simple one-step production of functionalized beads provides a tantalizing alternative to current commercial functional beads, for which proteins must be expressed, purified and then chemically attached to solid supports. The recent success in generating antigen-displaying PHA granules in the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis capable of mediating protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection highlights the promise and flexibility of this new technology.","2507":"Lignocellulosic biomass, upon pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, generates a mixture of hexose and pentose sugars such as glucose, xylose, arabinose and galactose. While Escherichia coli utilizes all these sugars it lacks the ability to produce ethanol from them. Recombinant ethanologenic E. coli strains have been created with a goal to produce ethanol from both hexose and pentose sugars. Herein, we review the current state of the art on the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates by an ethanologenic recombinant E. coli strain (FBR5). The bacterium is stable without antibiotics and can tolerate ethanol up to 50 gL(-1). It produces up to 45 g ethanol per L and has the potential to be used for industrial production of ethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates.","2508":"The heterologous expression of laccases is important for their large-scale production and genetic engineering--a prerequisite for industrial application. Pichia pastoris is the preferred expression host for fungal laccases. The recently cloned laccase from the ascomycete Botrytis aclada (BaLac) has been efficiently expressed in P. pastoris under the control of the inducible alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. In this study, we compare these results to the constitutive expression in the same organism using the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter. The results show that the amounts of BaLac produced with the GAP system (517 mgL(-1)) and the AOX1 system (495 mgL(-1)) are comparable. The constitutive expression is, however, faster, and the specific activity of BaLac in the culture supernatant is higher (41.3 Umg(-1) GAP, 14.2 Umg(-1) AOX1). In microtiter plates, the constitutive expression provides a clear advantage due to easy manipulation (simple medium, no methanol feeding) and fast enzyme production (high-throughput screening assays can already be performed after 48 h).","2509":"Metabolic engineering is often facilitated by cloning of genes encoding enzymes from various heterologous organisms into E. coli. Such engineering efforts are frequently hampered by foreign genes that are toxic to the E. coli host. We have developed PanDaTox (www.weizmann.ac.il\/pandatox), a web-based resource that provides experimental toxicity information for more than 1.5 million genes from hundreds of different microbial genomes. The toxicity predictions, which were extensively experimentally verified, are based on serial cloning of genes into E. coli as part of the Sanger whole genome shotgun sequencing process. PanDaTox can accelerate metabolic engineering projects by allowing researchers to exclude toxic genes from the engineering plan and verify the clonability of selected genes before the actual metabolic engineering experiments are conducted.","2510":"Vaccination is the most cost effective strategy for the control and prevention of the plethora of viral diseases affecting poultry production. The major challenge for poultry vaccination is the design of vaccines that will protect against multiple pathogens via a single protective dose, delivered by mass vaccination. The Marek disease virus and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus cause severe disease outbreaks in chickens. Vaccination with live herpesvirus of turkeys protects chickens from Marek disease and inactivated influenza viruses are used as antigens to protect chickens against influenza virus infections. We developed herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) as a vaccine vector that can act as a dual vaccine against avian influenza and Marek disease. The HVT vector was developed using reverse genetics based on an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of HVT. The BAC carrying the HVT genome was genetically modified to express the haemagglutinin (HA) gene of a highly pathogenic H7N1 virus. The resultant recombinant BAC construct containing the modified HVT sequence was transfected into chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells and HVT recombinants (rHVT-H7HA) harbouring the H7N1 HA were recovered. Analysis of cultured CEF cells infected with the rHVT-H7HA showed that HA was expressed and that the rescued rHVT-H7HA stocks were stable during several in vitro passages with no difference in growth kinetics compared with the parent HVT. Immunization of one-day-old chicks with rHVT-H7HA induced H7-specific antibodies and protected chickens challenged with homologous H7N1 virus against virus shedding, clinical disease and death. The rHVT-H7HA vaccine also induced strong and long-lasting antibody titers against H7HA in chickens that were vaccinated in ovo 3 d before hatching. This vaccine supports differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA), because no influenza virus nucleoprotein-specific antibodies were detected in the rHVT-H7HA vaccinated birds. The rHVT-H7HA not only provided protection against a lethal challenge with highly pathogenic H7N1 virus but also against highly virulent Marek disease virus and can be used as a DIVA vaccine.","2511":"Genetic bioaugmentation is an in situ bioremediation method that stimulates horizontal transfer of catabolic plasmids between exogenous donor cells and indigenous bacteria to increase the biodegradation potential of contaminants. A critical outcome of genetic bioaugmentation is the expression of an active catabolic phenotype upon plasmid conjugation. Using a pWW0-derivative TOL plasmid, we showed that certain genetic characteristics of the recipient bacteria, including genomic guanine-cytosine (G + C) content and phylogeny, may limit the expression of the transferred catabolic pathway. However, such genetic limitations observed in transconjugants could be overcome by the presence of an additional carbon source. Glucose and Luria-Bertani broth were shown to enhance the toluene degradation rates of transconjugants; these enhancement effects were dependent on transconjugant genomic G + C contents. Based on these observations, thorough genetic characterization of the indigenous microbial community in the contaminated environment of interest may provide a predictive tool for assessing the success of genetic bioaugmentation.","2512":"Chagas disease is the clinical manifestation of the infection produced by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Currently there is no vaccine to prevent this disease and the protection attained with vaccines containing non-replicating parasites is limited. Genetically attenuated trypanosomatid parasites can be obtained by deletion of selected genes. Gene deletion takes advantage of the fact that this parasite can undergo homologous recombination between endogenous and foreign DNA sequences artificially introduced in the cells. This approach facilitated the discovery of several unknown gene functions, as well as allowing us to speculate about the potential for genetically attenuated live organisms as experimental immunogens. Vaccination with live attenuated parasites has been used effectively in mice to reduce parasitemia and histological damage, and in dogs, to prevent vector-delivered infection in the field. However, the use of live parasites as immunogens is controversial due to the risk of reversion to a virulent phenotype. Herein, we present our results from experiments on genetic manipulation of two T. cruzi strains to produce parasites with impaired replication and infectivity, and using the mutation of the dhfr-ts gene as a safety device against reversion to virulence."},"articletitle":{"0":"Curcumol enhances cisplatin sensitivity of gastric cancer: involvement of microRNA-7 and the nuclear factor-kappa
