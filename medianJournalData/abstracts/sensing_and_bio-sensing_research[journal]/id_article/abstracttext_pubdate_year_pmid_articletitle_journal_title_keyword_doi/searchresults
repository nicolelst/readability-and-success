The sensors have fast (120 s) reversible responses, selectivity over other biologically relevant thiol-containing species, detection limits of 8 mM, and a detection range from approximately 5 to 500 mM. Sensitivities are shown to be 53 mV per decade at pH 8. Use of this compact, benchtop sensor platform requires little training - only the ability to measure DC voltage, which can be accomplished with a conventional multimeter or a simple analog data acquisition device paired with a personal computer. To the best of our knowledge, this report describes the first example of direct potentiometric measurement of the hydrosulfide ion in water.","3":null,"4":"COVID-19 has become a substantial lethal disease worldwide, and early diagnosis is a significant concern for this virus. Currently, RT-PCR is being used worldwide for the detection of this virus with human to human transmission. Furthermore, the recent develop biosensor leading to others diagnosis approach but being invasive are painful and time taking. Another possibility can be protein-based biomarkers as an application of biosensors for detection and early diagnostics. Considering the other approach, that is, microfluidics-based biosensor, though being a non-invasive method, will be restricting virus transmission. This review commences with the recent develop biosensor for Covid-19 detection and listing down the available biomarkers with their secretion range comparison of normal to COVID-19 patients through clinical analysis in china and concludes with the future approach for the diagnosis.","5":null,"6":"We present an object motion detection system using backscattered signal strength of passive UHF RFID tags as a sensor for providing information on the movement and identity of work objects-important cues for activity recognition. For using the signal strength for accurate detection of object movement we propose a novel Markov model with continuous observations, RSSI preprocessor, frame-based data segmentation, and motion-transition finder. We use the change of backscattered signal strength caused by tag's relocation to reliably detect movement of tagged objects. To maximize the accuracy of movement detection, an HMM-based classifier is designed and trained for dynamic settings, and the frequency of transitions between stationary\/moving states that is characteristic for different object types. We deployed a RFID system in a hospital trauma bay and evaluated our approach with data recorded in the trauma room during 28 simulated resuscitations performed by trauma teams. Our motion detection system shows 89.5% accuracy in this domain.","7":"The next generation of devices for personal healthcare monitoring will comprise molecular sensors to monitor analytes of interest in the skin compartment. Transdermal devices based on microneedles offer an excellent opportunity to explore the dynamics of molecular markers in the interstitial fluid, however good acceptability of these next generation devices will require several technical problems associated with current commercially available wearable sensors to be overcome. These particularly include reliability, comfort and cost. An essential pre-requisite for transdermal molecular sensing devices is that they can be fabricated using scalable technologies which are cost effective. We present here a minimally invasive microneedle array as a continuous monitoring platform technology. Method for scalable fabrication of these structures is presented. The microneedle arrays were characterised mechanically and were shown to penetrate human skin under moderate thumb pressure. They were then functionalised and evaluated as glucose, lactate and theophylline biosensors. The results suggest that this technology can be employed in the measurement of metabolites, therapeutic drugs and biomarkers and could have an important role to play in the management of chronic diseases.","8":null,"9":"In clinical oncology, diagnosis and evaluation of optimal treatment strategies are mostly based on histopathological examination combined with immunohistochemical (IHC) expression analysis of cancer-associated antigens in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue biopsies. However, informative IHC analysis depends on both the specificity and affinity of the binding reagent, which are inherently difficult to quantify in situ. Here we describe a label-free method that allows for the direct and real-time assessment of molecular binding kinetics in situ on FFPE tissue specimens using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) enabled biosensor technology. We analysed the interaction between the rVAR2 protein and its placental-like chondroitin sulfate (pl-CS) receptor in primary human placenta tissue and in breast and prostate tumour specimens in situ. rVAR2 interacted with FFPE human placenta and cancer tissue with an affinity in the nanomolar range, and showed no detectable interaction with pl-CS negative normal tissue. We further validated the method by including analysis with the androgen receptor N-20 antibody (anti-AR). As the KD value produced by this method is independent of the number of epitopes available, this readout offers a quantitative and unbiased readout for in situ binding-avidity and amount of binding epitopes. In summary, this method adds a new and important dimension to classical IHC-based molecular pathology by adding information about the binding characteristics in biologically relevant conditions. This can potentially be used to select optimal biologics for diagnostic and for therapeutic applications as well as guide the development of novel high affinity binding drugs.","10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":"Point-of-care measurement of the stress hormone cortisol will greatly facilitate the timely diagnosis and management of stress-related disorders. We describe an automated salivary cortisol immunosensor, incorporating centrifugal fluid valves and a disposable disc-chip that allows for truncated reporting of cortisol levels (&lt;15 min). The performance characteristics of the immunosensor are optimized through select blocking agents to prevent the non-specific adsorption of proteins; immunoglobulin G (IgG) polymer for the pad and milk protein for the reservoirs and the flow channels. Incorporated centrifugal fluid valves allow for rapid and repeat washings to remove impurities from the saliva samples. An optical reader and laptop computer automate the immunoassay processes and provide easily accessible digital readouts of salivary cortisol measurements. Linear regression analysis of the calibration curve for the cortisol immunosensor showed 0.92 of coefficient of multiple determination, R2, and 38.7% of coefficient of variation, CV, for a range of salivary cortisol concentrations between 0.4 and 11.3 ng\/mL. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of human saliva samples indicate potential utility for discriminating stress disorders and underscore potential application of the biosensor in stress disorders. The performance of our salivary cortisol immunosensor approaches laboratory based tests and allows noninvasive, quantitative, and automated analysis of human salivary cortisol levels with reporting times compatible with point-of-care applications."},"articletitle":{"0":"Sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using vertically-oriented silicon nanowire array-based biosensor.","1":"A review on the contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in water bodies: Transmission route, virus recovery and recent biosensor detection techniques.","2":"Hydrosulfide-selective ChemFETs for aqueous H2S\/HS- measurement.","3":"Review: Applications of surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) spectroscopy in bio-detection and biosensing.","4":"Protein based biomarkers for non-invasive Covid-19 detection.","5":"Rapid multiplex microfiber-based immunoassay for anti-MERS-CoV antibody detection.","6":"Object motion detection based on passive UHF RFID tags using a hidden Markov model-based classifier.","7":"Rapid, low cost prototyping of transdermal devices for personal healthcare monitoring.","8":"How Microelectrode Array-Based Chick Forebrain Neuron Biosensors Respond to Glutamate NMDA Receptor Antagonist AP5 and GABAA Receptor Antagonist Musimol.","9":"Real-time and label free determination of ligand binding-kinetics to primary cancer tissue specimens; a novel tool for the assessment of biomarker targeting.","10":"A nanoporous gold membrane for sensing applications.","11":"A highly sensitive monoclonal antibody based biosensor for quantifying 3-5 ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in aqueous environmental samples.","12":"MEISENHEIMER COMPLEX BETWEEN 2,4,6-TRINITROTOLUENE AND 3-AMINOPROPYLTRIETHOXYSILANE AND ITS USE FOR A PAPER-BASED SENSOR.","13":"Potential in vitro model for testing the effect of exposure to nanoparticles on the lung alveolar epithelial barrier.","14":"Automated-immunosensor with centrifugal fluid valves for salivary cortisol measurement."},"doi":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":""},"journal_title":{"0":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","1":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","2":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","3":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","4":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","5":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","6":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","7":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","8":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","9":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","10":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","11":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","12":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","13":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research","14":"Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research"},"keyword":{"0":"COVID-19Label-free detectionMetal-assisted chemical etching (MACE)Point-of-care deviceSARS-CoV-2Silicon nanowire biosensor","1":"BiosensorCoronavirusPolymer-chain-reactionSARS-CoV 2WastewaterWastewater based epidemiology","2":"","3":"Bio-detectionBiosensingEnhancement factorLimit of detectionMetal-enhanced fluorescenceSurface-enhanced fluorescence","4":"BiomarkersBiosensorsCovid-19MicrofluidicsNon-invasiveVirus","5":"MERSMicrofiberMultiplex immunoassayPOCRapid","6":"HMM classifierMotion detectionUHF RFID tags","7":"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)Continuous lactate monitoring (CLM)Interstitial therapeutic drug monitoring (iTDM)MicroneedlesMinimally invasive sensors","8":"AP5biosensorchick forebrain neuronmicroelectrode arraymusimolneurotoxicity","9":"BiomarkerBiosensorCancerMalariaQuartz crystal microscaleVAR2CSA","10":"Gold membraneNanoporePlasmonsPolymer sphereSERSSensing","11":"BiosensorMonoclonal antibodyPAHPore waterPyrene","12":"Meisenheimer ComplexTNT detectionnitroaromatics","13":"In vitro modelLungNanoparticlesPulmonary barrierToxicology","14":"AutomationCentrifugal fluid valveCortisolImmunosensorSaliva"},"pmid":{"0":35340912,"1":35251937,"2":33791191,"3":33101976,"4":32835001,"5":32289017,"6":30505681,"7":28424755,"8":27551670,"9":27441183,"10":26973809,"11":26925369,"12":26380171,"13":28503407,"14":26543818},"pubdate_year":{"0":2022,"1":2022,"2":2021,"3":2020,"4":2020,"5":2019,"6":2018,"7":2017,"8":2016,"9":2016,"10":2016,"11":2016,"12":2015,"13":2015,"14":2014}}
