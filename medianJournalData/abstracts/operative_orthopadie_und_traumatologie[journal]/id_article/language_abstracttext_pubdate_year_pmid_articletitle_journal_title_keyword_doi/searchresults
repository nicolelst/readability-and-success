The presence of extensive scars after previous operations in the donor area or irradiation of the donor area which may compromise the flap perfusion. A distinction is made between local skin flaps, perforator-based fasciocutaneous flaps and the myocutaneous gluteus maximus flap. By partial or complete elevation of the gluteus maximus muscle based on the superior and inferior gluteal vessels, this flap is useful for larger and deep defects in the sacral and ischial region. For more superficial defects, fasciocutaneous perforator flaps might be used. Smaller ulcers can be treated with local skin flaps. The donor site should be closed primarily. Consistent, postoperative relief by prone and lateral positioning of the patient, avoiding new decubitus ulcers. Drainage for at least 5-7 days. Antibiotic therapy is indicated only with appropriate detection of pathogens and in case of persistent infection.

This individual and novel implant is custom made for displaced acetabular and periprosthetic fractures in patients with osteopenic bone. It provides a hopeful benefit due to early full weight-bearing mobilization within the first 10 days after surgery.

The clinical presentation may vary considerable due to the time of their occurrence as early, delayed, or late infection. Recognition of risk factors and knowledge of differential diagnoses facilitate and confirm the diagnosis. The synovial fluid is assessed with regard to leukocyte count, protein content, and glucose. Intraoperative tissue specimen sampling has to be performed correctly; the histopathological and microbiological studies must be assessed using specific criteria. The examination and classification of periprosthetic membranes make discrimination of the causal pathological mechanism possible, especially distinction between septic and aseptic loosening. In this manner statements with regard to etiology and prosthesis durability are possible. Different causative microorganisms appear postoperatively at specific times. Pathogens that grow as biofilms are of great significance, as they may compound diagnosis and therapy. Early infections are often caused by virulent microorganisms (S. aureus) with acute onset. Delayed (low grade) infections are usually caused by less virulent microorganisms, such as S. epidermidis or coagulase-negative staphylococci. Many diagnostic imaging methods have been used in the assessment of periprosthetic infection: plain radiographs, arthrography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Nuclear medicine with bone scintigraphy or positron-emission tomography enhance diagnostic capabilities.

The etiology is multifactorial; however, predominantly biological determinants seem to influence the structural outcome. Basically, recurrent defects due to non-healing of the rotator cuff tendons have to be distinguished from true re-ruptures, which occur after primary successful osteofibroblastic integration. Different modes of failure are responsible for recurrent defects of the rotator cuff. The management of recurrent defects depends on the clinical symptoms of the patient, the objective function of the shoulder and the pathomorphological changes of the rotator cuff and the shoulder joint itself. Beside a skillful neglect and\/or conservative management, arthroscopic revision of failed cuff repairs appears to be a promising procedure. Irreparable tears can be managed using extraanatomic tendon transfer (latissimus dorsi or pectoralis major transfer) or shoulder replacement procedures (reverse prosthesis) depending on the functional symptoms of the patient.

The double-rod system has to be distracted every 4-6 months. The system is used in young patients too tall for VEPTR (vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib) instrumentation. The system with a very low profile allows reduced soft-tissue pressure saving soft tissue from atrophy or the development of pseudocysts above the screws.

Next, the pedicle is prepared with a tap, and the USS paediatric pedicle screw system with its very low profile is inserted under fluoroscopic control in anterior-posterior and lateral view. In the upper thoracic spine the authors use screws 4.2 mm in diameter, in the lower thoracic spine 5-mm screws, and in the lumbar spine 6-mm screws. Measurement of the rod length and insertion of the rod are performed. When spinal growth for &gt; 4 years is expected, distraction of the double-rod system by the use of two dominos is done on the concave and convex side of the curve to modulate spinal growth. When spinal growth for 2-4 years is expected, distraction is done just at the concave side of the curve. For correction of the curve, either segmental correction or classic derotation by the Cotrel-Dubousset technique can be performed. Postoperative on block rotation. Mobilization of the patient on day 2 after surgery with a rigid brace. Individual rigid custom-made plaster brace for 3-8 months. During postoperative recovery, muscular efforts should be reduced for 6 months after first implantation. Distraction of the system is necessary every 4-6 months to modulate spinal growth. From 2004 to 2008, 26 patients (15 girls, eleven boys) with a mean age of 9 years (6-13 years) were treated using this technique. Follow-up examinations were performed 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. The mean follow-up was 26 months (6-40 months). At first implantation of the scoliosis instrumentation, just little scoliosis correction was done depending on the quality of bone. At every distraction, an average correction of the Cobb angle of 5 degrees was reached. The Cobb angle could be reduced from 71 degrees to 34 degrees on average. Fusion rate in the cranial and caudal part was evaluated by X-ray. 5-mm rods have a reduced stiffness of 50% compared to USS 6-mm rods. Average spinal growth was about 5.6 cm (4.0-8.1 cm) over a period of 3.2 +\/- 1.2 years.

","671":"Loss of motion of the elbow is not uncommon after trauma, burns, or coma and severely impairs upper limb function. Loss of motion may be difficult to avoid and is challenging to treat. Detailed analysis of the etiology and diagnostic evaluation are of utmost importance for planning any surgical intervention for elbow stiffness. Most activities of daily living are possible, if the elbow has a range of motion of 100 degrees (30-130 degrees of flexion, Morrey's arc of motion). Stiff elbow, usually defined as less than 30 degrees extension or less than 130 degrees flexion. Poor compliance, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, active hepatitis B and C infection, HIV infection, acute articular infection. Current operative techniques, such as closed distraction with external fixation (arthrodiatasis), are presented and evaluated. Elbow arthrolysis is a technically demanding procedure. If indication and techniques are used correctly and surgeon, physiotherapist, and patient are familiar with the procedure, good long-term results may be achieved.

This paper surveys frequently used applications of plaster of Paris in hand surgery.","674":"Arthrodesis of the wrist in order to improve functional use of the hand by reducing pain and improving grip strength. Painful destruction of both the radiocarpal and mediocarpal joint combined with contraindications to motion-preserving procedures. Conservative treatment insufficient. Patients who are pain-free and satisfied with a motion-preserving procedure (e.g., Wilhelm's denervation procedure) or conservative management (casting). Dorsal approach to the wrist. Removal of destroyed articular surfaces down to cancellous bone, filling the resulting defects with cancellous bone graft taken either from the the radius or the iliac crest. Stable fixation using the AO wrist fusion plate. Immediate active motion exercises of the fingers. Below-elbow cast for 2 weeks. 6 weeks postoperatively, X-ray control to judge bony healing. Normal use of the hand in daily life but avoiding pain-provoking activities. 26 (18 men, eight women) of the authors' first patients with arthrodesis of the wrist using the AO fusion plate were reexamined after a mean follow-up time of 18 months (minimum 6, maximum 32 months). The mean modified Mayo Wrist Score was 47 points (minimum 20, maximum 70 points), the DASH Score (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) averaged 46 points (minimum 4, maximum 81 points). 20 of the 26 patients were satisfied, but not all patients were completely free of pain. Eight out of a total of ten patients (seven men, three women) with a bilateral wrist arthrodesis were reexamined after a mean follow-up time of 66 months (minimum 27, maximum 74 months). The DASH Score was 55 points on average (minimum 38, maximum 73 points). All patients stated that their clinical situation had improved and that they were able to manage their daily activities without help.

Immobilization in a long arm cast with 45 degrees forearm supination for 4 weeks. Afterwards, forearm pronation and supination are further limited for 4 weeks by a splint. Following that period, the range of motion and the load are raised to normal levels. The hemiresection-interposition arthroplasty of the distal radioulnar joint improves the range of forearm rotation. Pain is significantly reduced and grip strength increased. Instability of the distal ulna may persist or result; however, this gives rise to moderate complaints only in some patients. Patients' satisfaction is high and the functional results are good.

Unstable extraarticular fractures of the distal radius AO types A2 and A3, which can be managed by closed or indirect reduction. Intraarticular fractures of the distal radius showing a nondisplaced articular component. Also indicated in patients with osteoporosis. Extraarticular distal radius fractures with a distal fragment too small for placement of the distal locking pegs and\/or a comminution extending into the diaphyseal portion of the radius. Displaced intraarticular fractures of the distal radius. Nascent malunions of the distal radius. Closed reduction of the fracture, straight dorsal incision of 3-4 cm length centered over Lister's tubercle. The extensor pollicis longus tendon is released and retracted toward the radial side. Lister's tubercle is exposed subperiosteally and removed with a rongeur. This creates a flat surface for seating the head of the implant. Proximal dissection is carried out to expose the fracture site and the dorsal ridge on the proximal fragment. The medullary canal is opened with an awl. The radiocarpal joint line is located by inserting a needle. The silhouette of the head of the implant is drawn with a marker pen, with its distal edge resting 4-6 mm proximal to the joint line. This is done to carve a notch on the distal edge of the proximal fragment in line with the third extensor compartment with the purpose of receiving the neck of the device. The insertion jig is assembled to the implant. The implant is then introduced in a retrograde fashion, through the fracture site, into the proximal fragment and advanced with gentle rotational motion. The head of the device is seated flush on the distal fragment. Under fluoroscopic guidance, in an anatomic lateral view, the tract for the central peg is drilled and the peg is applied in the central hole. This peg fixes the palmar tilt. By use of the jig, the proximal unicortical holes are drilled, and the proximal locking screws, which fix the radial length, are applied. After removal of the insertion jig, the remaining distal pegs are applied. During drilling, the distal fragment must be pushed up against the implant to assure that the head is flush with its surface. After application, the extensor pollicis longus tendon will course proximal to the head of the implant in the subcutaneous position while the tendons of the second and fourth extensor compartments will travel on each side of the implant, thereby avoiding tendon impingement. Use of a palmar synthetic splint for 10 days. Active range of motion of the fingers is allowed immediately after surgery. On the 11th postoperative day, a custom-formed short arm splint is provided and active wrist motion is started. Radiologic control 4 weeks postoperatively.

Additionally, in some cases an intramuscular lengthening of the contracted gastrocnemius muscle is necessary. In case of flatfoot deformity alignment should be restored by calcaneal lengthening and\/or medializing sliding calcaneal osteotomy. The lower leg is immobilized in a cast for at least 2 weeks postoperatively; additional procedures require an extended period of immobilization. Afterwards, range of motion exercises are useful to regain motion of the peritalar joint complex. 24 resections of a talocalcaneal coalition in 22 pediatric or adolescent patients were carried out. The coalition was located at the medial joint facet in 18 cases and in the dorsomedial talocalcaneal region in seven cases (in one patient combination of both). Three patients presented with an additional calcaneonavicular coalition. A talocalcaneal bone bridge of the entire joint was found in five cases.

Insufficient power (&lt; M(4)) of the triceps (inadequate triceps function can lead to a flexion contracture of the elbow). After exposure of the biceps tendon a long Z-plasty is used to lengthen the tendon and allow its distal segment to be rerouted around the neck of the radius mediolaterally. The tendon ends are sutured. The technique allows the biceps to become a pronator instead of a supinator while preserving its original function of elbow flexion. In case of interosseous membrane contracture a release of the membrane is necessary. Immobilization in an upper plaster cast or Gilchrist bandage with the elbow in 90 degrees flexion and the forearm in neutral rotation or pronation, no extension below 90 degrees flexion\/no supination for 6 weeks. Passive and active exercises of elbow extension, flexion and pronation until the maximally possible range of motion has been reached (12-18 months); dynamic pronation orthosis, if needed. Eleven children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy and an average age of 6 years (4-12 years) were operated. In eight cases, besides rerouting of the biceps tendon, a release of the interosseous membrane was performed. Average follow-up time is 36 months (10-55 months).

Functionally useful results can be expected in 60-75% of patients, especially if there is some residual function (M1 or M2) left (\"augmentation indication\"). Early free functional muscle transplantation shows best results in patients with direct muscle defect, because all vascular and neuronal structures are still available, and no secondary changes such as fibrosis or joint stiffness are present yet. There are inconsistent results for patients with neurologic insufficiency (i.e., total brachial plexus palsy) or mixed neuromuscular insufficiency, such as compartment syndrome. Especially in complete brachial plexus lesion, free functional muscle transfer is often the only treatment option.

A prospective evaluation of the first 146 consecutive patients with 1-year follow-up revealed significant improvements of about 151% regarding pain and of about 98% in function without significant differences between different indications. Four shaft fissures were observed and treated with intraoperative cerclages during the learning period. No further fissures were noted after adaptation of the surgical procedure and subsequent guidelines. One traumatic and one atraumatic head rotation were observed but should be prevented with a new torque wrench.

Other decision-making factors for surgery include secondary injuries to the menisci or limitation of daily activities due to the instability produced by the ACL rupture. The indication for surgical intervention has to be judged individually and carefully in younger children. Poor compliance on the part of the patient to participate in postoperative rehabilitation.

Tibial canal entry medial to the tibial tuberosity, entering the joint at the level of the anterior horn of lateral meniscus in the intercondylar notch. Optimal positioning confirmed by an intraoperative negative impingement test of the guiding pin before drilling. Femoral canal entry placed at the 10:00-10:30 o'clock position on the right side, and 01:30-02:00 o'clock position on the left side. Care must be taken to avoid injury to the perichondral ring. In younger children (Tanner stage 3 or lower), avoidance of fixation material transfixing the epiphysis - femoral fixation performed using endobutton and tibial fixation with the Suture-disc. In older children (Tanner stage 4 or above) alternative fixation methods are possible (interference screw). The fixation of the ACL tendon transplant is such that reconstruction is in minimal tension in 30 degrees flexion. Postoperative treatment regimen in the first 6 weeks after surgery depends on the extent of additive surgeries (menisci, chondral injuries) performed in the same sitting. In the absence of associated injuries, weight bearing is gradually increased with the aim of achieving full weight bearing at the end of the 1st postoperative week. In case of additional meniscal sutures, knee flexion is restricted to 60 degrees maximum and non-weight bearing for 4 weeks is advised. Postoperative mobilization is performed using an adjustable knee orthesis. Between 4-6 weeks postoperatively, the permitted flexion is gradually increased to a maximum of 90 degrees and partial weight bearing is started. Full weight bearing and free movements with muscle training are started after 6 weeks. Avoidance of weight transmission on the flexed and rotated knee until 12 weeks postoperatively.

The stabilization of femur fractures with ESIN is recommended for diapyseal femur fractures in children &gt; or = 4 years until closure of the growth plates. Open fractures with significant injuries to the soft tissues as well as burst fractures should not be treated with ESIN. Small incisions are made medial and lateral of the femur just above the distal growth plate. The cortex is perforated with an awl. The first ESIN is pushed via this perforation intramedullary retrograde via the fracture site to the proximal femur near the trochanteric region. Afterwards, the second nail is passed through the opposite cortex of the distal femur after opening it in the same way. The second nail has to be pushed parallel retrograde via the fracture site into the contralateral trochanteric region. The flexible nail design enables the surgeon to fix the fracture via a three-point stabilization. Postoperative mobilization is allowed on crutches with reduced weight depending on the type of fracture. According to the ESIN position transverse fractures allow an early switch toward full weight bearing, whereas in fractures with multiple fragments, weight bearing should be reduced for several weeks until radiologic healing is seen. The minimally invasive method of ESIN is a well-accepted treatment option for femur fracture in children yielding good and excellent clinical results. It is the treatment of first choice for transverse and oblique femoral fractures (32-D\/4.1 und 32-D\/5.1). Fractures with several fragments (32-D\/5.2) as well as fractures of the metaphyseal region (31-M\/3.1 und 33-M\/3.1) may be difficult to stabilize with ESIN and might alternatively be treated with an external fixator.

Closed bone reduction is suitable for most minimally displaced fractures but in uncertain cases with advanced displacement, operative reduction may be necessary. The osteosynthesis can be achieved preferably by cannulated screws which, depending on the localization, can be placed intersecting the growth plate. Basically, plaster immobilization is not necessary in case of stable osteosynthesis. Depending on the patient's cooperation and the fracture stability, a lower-leg cast may additionally be applied.

After 6 weeks, the load can be increased stepwise depending on the consolidation as seen on the control radiographs. Full weight bearing is generally reached after 10 weeks. During this time, thromboembolism prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin is necessary. A retrospective analysis of the own patients treated with the described surgical technique was performed. On the basis of Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, it could be demonstrated that there is a correlation between the patients' level of activity and the long-term survival rate 10-15 years after the osteotomy.

Disimpaction of the slipped epiphysis in several planes by wedge-shaped osteotomy in the subcapital region of the femoral neck (slippage is in a posterior and caudal direction). Careful preservation of the nutrient vessels to the femoral head within the posterior capsule. Stabilization of the osteotomy with cannulated screws with a short thread. The data reported in the literature vary greatly with regard to frequency and extent of femoral head necrosis. The present author holds the opinion that this risk is minimal, if the surgeon proceeds with care. Nevertheless, the indications for this procedure should be chosen with great reservation. ","781":"In the management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis, the modified technique of so-called open traction reduction has proven to be atraumatic, relatively straightforward in terms of surgical technique, and has led to successful outcomes. It seems that additional, that is, surgery-related circulatory disorders of the femoral epiphysis can be avoided by this method.","782":"In clinical practice, proper three-dimensional planning and implementation of intertrochanteric correction of femoral epiphyseal alignment are usually sidestepped because of their complexity and replaced by more or less effective approximations. After transverse osteotomy and in the absence of geometric planning procedures, the proximal part is manipulated and mobilized into its correct position under image intensification. After the second, parallel osteotomy, an appropriately dimensioned and aligned correction wedge emerges \"automatically\". In contrast to conventional intertrochanteric correction osteotomy, the seating chisel for angled-blade plating is only positioned after osteotomy and wedge excision have been completed. A short element of the external fixator system is temporarily mounted at the greater trochanter for the purpose of manipulation and stabilization of the proximal part. Osteosynthesis corresponds to the osteotomy cut at right angles to the femoral shaft and is performed using the adult or adolescent 90 degrees angled-blade plate. This modified technique for intertrochanteric correction osteotomy has proven its worth in clinical practice for 19 years despite the rather more complex surgical procedure. In nine patients, anatomically permissible realignment of the epiphysis was achieved in the intertrochanteric region without specific complications. ","783":"The aim of treatment of slipped capital femoral epiphysis is an anatomically aligned epiphysis with normal blood supply.

Other procedures have, so far, not gained optimal control over the risk of avascular necrosis. Acute epiphyseolysis. Chronic epiphyseolysis for which trimming of the metaphyseal overhang to permit free flexion and internal rotation without impingement would leave less than two thirds of the femoral neck diameter intact. Ankylosis of the hip joint at an advanced stage. Destruction of the femoral head. The blood supply to the epiphysis from the medial femoral circumflex artery can be preserved by surgical hip dislocation and a soft-tissue flap derived subperiosteally from the retinaculum and external rotators. This soft-tissue flap permits not only the detachment of the epiphysis, but also complete callus resection from the femoral neck without causing tension in the retinaculum. Dislocation of the femoral head ensures its manual protection during curettage of the epiphyseal plate and, ultimately, allows anatomic reduction under visual control of the retinaculum. With the head dislocated there is less risk to the integrity of the retinaculum due to unintentional manipulation of the leg than there would be, if the head remained in the socket. From 1996 to 2005, 30 hips with a diagnosis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis were treated according to the technique described. The average follow-up time was 55 months (24-96 months). Femoral head necrosis did not occur. Distribution across sexes was well balanced. Girls were 12 years old at the time of the operation and boys were 14 years old on average. Posterior displacement was measured at 30-70 degrees. In six hips there was a so-called acute on chronic slip. Two hips required revision due to screw failure, a difficulty that was addressed by the introduction of fully threaded wires. One hip had to be revised because the fully threaded wire bent.

Allergies to implant materials. A Kirschner wire is inserted through a lateral proximal approach in the femur into the center of the displaced epiphysis at a right angle to its base. Overdrilling of the wire, thread tapping in the cancellous bone, insertion of the cannulated gliding screw with washer. The screw threads lie only in the epiphysis. The unthreaded part of the screw bridges the growth plate. The screw is allowed to protrude by about 2.5 cm to prevent an epiphyseodesis effect. Partial weight bearing of the affected extremity up to 10 kg body weight for 6 weeks. Thrombosis prophylaxis during convalescence only for adolescents with signs of puberty (menarche\/pubarche). Restriction on sports activities for 3 months. Follow-ups: clinical and radiologic examinations at 3 months postoperatively, then clinical examination every 6 months and radiologic assessment annually (possibly earlier, if there is a growth spurt). The gliding screw is removed when growth is completed. 63 hips (34 prophylactically and 29 therapeutically) were stabilized with the gliding screw. Clinically, the prophylactically stabilized hips showed excellent outcomes; of the therapeutically stabilized hips, the results were 19 excellent, seven good, two satisfactory, and one poor. Differences in leg length were seen in five cases, whereby the average value was 0.3 cm (0-1 cm). Chondrolysis or femoral head necrosis was not observed. Screw revision was necessary in 22 cases because contact between the screw head and the cortex would have prevented continued longitudinal growth (unintentional epiphyseodesis). ","786":"To stabilize the unstable capital femoral epiphysis to stop further slippage. To prevent imminent epiphyseal dislocation with subsequent articulation disorders of the hip joint and joint degeneration. To prevent additional growth disorders of the proximal femur. Epiphyseolysis capitis femoris acuta. Epiphyseolysis capitis femoris lenta. Epiphyseolysis capitis femoris incipiens (incipient epiphyseolysis). Epiphyseolysis capitis femoris imminens (imminent epiphyseolysis of the so-called healthy contralateral side). None. The diagnosis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis is an absolute indication for surgery unless there is an internal or pediatric disorder that dictates a conservative approach. Three, possibly four, Kirschner wires, at least 2 mm thick, are inserted through a short subtrochanteric approach under image intensification into the femoral neck so that they are seen to be spread uniformly over the cross section of the femoral head when viewed in both planes. The opposite side is transfixed prophylactically. 3 weeks partial loading at 10 kg, then increased loading after radiologic assessment. Radiologic assessment every 6 months until the end of the growth phase so that migration of the Kirschner wiresout of the femoral head can be identified early. If necessary, renewed Kirschner wire transfixation. Implants are removed after consolidation and closure of the growth plate. 59 therapeutic and 48 prophylactic transfixations of slipped capital femoral epiphysis were performed from 1970 to 1995. The average follow-up period was 4 years (0.1-17.3 years). The most frequent complications were incipient secondary joint degeneration arising in most cases from femoral head necrosis, and postoperative identification of Kirschner wire malalignment. At the time of follow-up 27 patients had an excellent result on the pathologic side according to Southwick's classification, 26 a good, three a moderate, and three a poor result. In particular, a poor result ensued subsequent to femoral head necrosis. ","787":"AIMS OF DIAGNOSTIC RADIOGRAPHY: Visualization of the proximal femur in two clearly defined projections. Radiologic and morphological diagnosis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Evaluation of the stability of the femoral epiphysis: chronic slippage or acute interruption of continuity between the femoral epiphysis and the femoral neck metaphysis. Radiometric measurement of the spatial deformity of the femoral epiphysis. Measurement of the projected epiphyseal angle on the radiograph as the basis for possible conversion into anatomically correct angles at the proximal femur. Preoperative planning of therapeutic surgical procedures. Idiopathic hip pain in the growing child or adolescent. Referred pain to the knee or thigh. Unusual gait pattern with external rotation deformity of the leg, limping that favors one leg or limping due to leg length discrepancy. Abnormal sonography, CT or MRI findings. Eventful history including minor injury or genuine trauma. Symptoms and uncommon physical constitution: obesity, exceptional longitudinal growth of the extremities, and absence of secondary sex characteristics. Indications for Radiographic Imaging of the Hip Joint in Two Planes None. Standard positioning of the patient or the affected extremity. First standard radiograph: proximal femur in anteroposterior projection. Position of the leg with the patella directed anteriorly. Contraction of the external rotators at the hip joint is compensated by elevation of the hip until the leg is in the neutral position. Second standard radiograph: axial view of the proximal femur in anteroposterior projection. Leg flexed to 90 degrees at the hip and in 45 degrees abduction. Thigh position parallel to the longitudinal axis of the table (zero rotation). Early signs of incipient or imminent femoral epiphyseolysis: --Disintegration, widening and blurred margins of the epiphyseal plate. --Increasing loss of height of the femoral epiphysis due to incipient dislocation. --The tangent to the lateral femoral neck intersects only slightly with the femoral head or runs tangential to the epiphysis. --Important second radiograph in axial projection: incipient slippage is seen early here. Comparison with the contralateral side. Chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis in adolescents: --Advanced epiphyseal dislocation visible in both planes. The tangent to the lateral femoral neck no longer intersects with the dislocated femoral epiphysis. In some cases, varus deformity of the femoral neck and periosteal elevation at the borders of the medial femoral neck. --Epiphyseal dislocation even more apparent in the axial view. Acute slipped capital femoral epiphysis in adolescents: --Complete interruption of continuity between epiphysis and metaphysis. --Widened gap between epiphysis and metaphysis. --Cystic irregularities of the metaphysis. --In most cases, substantial dislocation between epiphysis and metaphysis. --\"Acute on chronic slip\": specific type of acute epiphyseal dislocation subsequent to chronic epiphyseolysis. In addition to signs of acute separation, secondary symptoms of chronic epiphyseolysis such as femoral neck arcuation and spur formation at the head-neck junction. --Dynamic fluoroscopy may be indicated to confirm acute dislocation. Defined axes are marked on the radiograph: anatomic axis of the femur, femoral neck axis, and so-called epiphyseal axis (perpendicular to the base of the epiphysis). Measurement of the projected epiphysis-diaphysis angle (ED' angle) on the anteroposterior radiograph and the projected epiphyseal torsion angle (ET' angle) on the axial radiograph. For slight to moderate slippage, the difference between the epiphyseal dislocation angle obtained from the radiographs (as projected in two planes) compared with the anatomic, i.e., real dislocation angle at the proximal femur is generally relatively minor. Conversion of the projected angle to the real angle is not essential in these cases (if in doubt, see Table 1). For more severe dislocations, the differences between the projected and real angles are far more apparent. Table 1 facilitates conversion of the epiphyseal dislocation angles taken from the radiograph into anatomically correct dislocation angles at the proximal femur. Conversion to real angles, especially for preoperative planning of complex corrective surgery, is indicated for more severe deformities of the femoral epiphysis. Conversion into real (anatomic) angles is indicated for exact prognostic evaluation of prearthrotic deformities.

The trial prosthesis is fitted, its position is checked, and the final unconstrained prosthetic components are inserted using a press-fit technique. The dorsal aponeurosis is reapproximated. 20 patients were treated for posttraumatic or idiopathic arthritis with 24 pyrolytic carbon PIP prostheses, and a follow-up examination was carried out after an average of 15 months (6-30 months). Surgical management was changed from arthroplasty to arthrodesis in three cases. For the remaining prostheses, an average range of motion of 50 degrees was achieved for the proximal interphalangeal joint. On the visual analog scale (VAS; 0: no pain, 10: incapacitating pain), the patients suffered few symptoms (VAS: 0-3). 80% of patients said they were satisfied with the outcome of the operation. In three cases (one infection, two dislocations) the prostheses had to be removed and arthrodesis performed. Migration of the distal components was observed on the radiographs in five cases, and of the proximal components in four cases, although this did not have any effect on the functional parameters. The development of a painless noise (\"squeaking\") was noticed in nine out of 21 prostheses. However, as with prosthetic migration, this did not cause any functional deficits.

In biomechanical terms, the stable fixation of the meniscal horns is decisive. Fixation of the periphery of the meniscus to the joint capsule by vertical sutures alone is not sufficient but does play an important role in the incorporation of the meniscal tissue.

Use of systemic muscle relaxants. Caution in patient with cardiac pacemaker. Preliminary experiments showed that a standard nerve-stimulating device can deliver a negatively charged, monophasic square pulse of current through Ilizarov wires. During the application of an Ilizarov frame to potentially hazardous anatomic regions, providing no systemic muscle relaxants are used, a voltage field sufficient to cause nerves in close proximity to the Ilizarov wire to depolarize is produced. Identification of a distal muscle twitch provoked by the stimulation may indicate a potential for iatrogenic nerve injury. Results show that with the nerve stimulator set at 2.5 mA (pulsed at a frequency of 2 Hz), peripheral nerves are stimulated if they lie within 5 mm of the wires. Should a distal muscle twitch occur, wires should be repositioned so that equivalent stimulation produces no twitch. The technique was used during Ilizarov frame application in ten patients, with only a single occurrence of distal muscle twitches in a lower-leg frame. Following repositioning of the Ilizarov wire in this case, no further twitches were observed, indicating that no Ilizarov wire was inserted close to peripheral nerves.

In 31 subsequent hips the midpoint of the femoral head was found by central drilling of the femoral neck. Using the centering device, the average deviation of the angle of the prosthesis from the preoperative CCD angle was 7 degrees (+\/- 5.7 degrees ); for central drilling of the femoral neck it was only 3 degrees (+\/- 3.4 degrees ). The exact alignment of the resurfacing component is crucial for the success of surgery. It is achieved with greater precision with central drilling of the neck than with the manufacturer's centering device.

Very small (&lt; 5 mm) proximal fragments at the point of nail entry. Bony avulsions of the triceps tendon. In the case of displaced olecranon fractures, exposure of the ulnar nerve, open reduction, fracture retention with reduction forceps, introduction of a 1.6 or 2.0 mm thick central guide wire into the medullary cavity in a slightly radial direction, overdrilling with a 3.5- or 4.5-mm cannulated drill bit, introduction of the nail to the aiming arm, and locking with 2.0-mm threaded wires. If the fracture pattern is transverse or slightly oblique, axial compression can be achieved by insertion of a compression screw into the nail. Fragments from the posterior margin or medial\/lateral comminuted zones can be fixed more securely to the system via fiber cerclage wires around the threaded wires. After checking by X-ray, shortening of the threaded wires with the bolt cutters. Stable under exertion, splint-free postoperative management for 6 weeks, followed by full load bearing. From May 1999 to December 2002, 80 olecranon fractures were treated using the XS nail. 73 patients (91.3%) were followed up after an average of 15 months. 49 (67.1%) had a multifragmentary or comminuted fracture, and 24 (32.9%) a simple transverse fracture. According to the Murphy Score, results were excellent in 47 cases (64.4%), good in 21 (28.8%), satisfactory in three (4.1%), and poor in two (2.7%).

Passively correctable, painful pes planovalgus of various etiologies such as stage II flatfoot as graded by Johnson &amp; Strom mostly due to degeneration of the posterior tibial tendon in stage II-III as described by Jahss. Fixed pes planovalgus, osteoporosis of the calcaneus, advanced degenerative arthritis of the subtalar, talonavicular or calcaneocuboid joints. Transverse osteotomy of the anterior process of the calcaneus approximately 1.5 cm proximal of and parallel to the calcaneocuboid joint. Lengthening of the lateral column using the sandwich technique by the interposition of one to two autologous, tricortical bone grafts, which are structured to straighten the hindfoot and to move it toward neutral position. If the technique is performed correctly, the talus and the calcaneus are in alignment. When the talar head is externally rotated and the calcaneus is moved toward varus, this results in axial alignment of the abducted forefoot and straightening of the collapsed longitudinal arch of the foot. Between June 1995 and March 2003, 21 patients with stage II painful pes planovalgus as described by Johnson &amp; Strom underwent a modified Evans osteotomy. In one case an arthrodesis of the first tarsometatarsal joint was carried out, and in four cases a lengthening of the gastrocnemius muscle according to Strayer. A replacement of the insufficient posterior tibial tendon was not necessary in any of the cases. With respect to complications one wound edge necrosis and one nonunion were seen. 15 patients (eleven women, four men, average age 54 years) were followed up for an average of 48 months (12-81 months) postoperatively. The Maryland Foot Score improved significantly from 49.6 points preoperatively to 87.8 points postoperatively (p &lt; 0.01).

Very small (&lt; 5 mm) distal fragments (if fixation of the fragments is not possible using a small XXS nail) and very narrow (&lt; 2.5 mm) medullary cavity (conversion to plate fixation). With displaced fibula fractures, open reduction should be performed with fracture retention using wide-armed reduction forceps, insertion of a central guide wire into the medullary cavity, use of a cannulated drill bit, introduction of the nail using an aiming arm and locked fixation with threaded wire. After checking the position using X-ray, the wire should be shortened using the bolt cutters. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT (Depending on the Weber classification): Full weight bearing for all isolated distal fractures of the fibula (Weber types A and B) and isolated fractures of the medial malleolus. For distal fractures of the fibula (Weber types A and B) with additional fracture of the medial malleolus or involvement of the medial ligament partial weight bearing of 20 kp for 4 weeks, followed by full weight bearing. For all Weber C fractures and\/or additional Volkmann fracture only 10 kp of partial weight bearing with a rocker-sole orthosis should be allowed for 6 weeks followed by full weight bearing. No weight bearing for 6 weeks until the screws are removed is only recommended, if positioning screws have been used for Weber C fractures. In the period from 05\/2000 to 01\/2002, 194 ankle fractures were treated with the IP-XS-Nail((R)). Follow-up examinations were conducted on 162 patients with an average age of 51.2 years after an average of 15 months. 62 Weber B fractures (38.3%) and 45 Weber C fractures (27.7%) were evaluated. There were bimalleolar fractures in 55 cases (34.0%).

From January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2003, 25 children with an average age of 12 years suffering from medial epicondylar avulsion fractures were operated on using open reduction and Kirschner wire fixation. An average of 3 years after the injury 14 of these children underwent follow-up examination using a procedure that took subjective, clinical and radiologic parameters into account. Two children showed a slight reduction in overall strength of the injured extremity when compared with the contralateral extremity. One child had a flexion deficit of 10 degrees, all other children showed movement limitations of &lt; or = 5 degrees compared to the contralateral extremity.

Between May 1998 and September 2001, a total of 42 patients had their distal femoral fractures stabilized by LISS. The AO distractor was used from the 18th case onward. A time saving of approximately 13% was estimated, taking the learning curve of the LISS system into consideration. Three of 42 fractures showed relevant postoperative varus or valgus malalignment. No rotational malalignment was found. An effect of the LISS tractor on the incidence of malalignment could not be found with the limited number of cases examined; however, malalignment was correlated well with the rates found in literature for distal femoral fractures.

Large metaphyseal bony defects of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Missing or insufficient extensor mechanism. The articulating spacer is made intraoperatively by cleaning and autoclaving the explanted femoral component and the tibial polyethylene insert. These components are reinserted by \"press-fit cementing\" without cement interdigitation into the trabecular bone. The cement is loaded with antibiotic during the same operation (2-4 g antibiotics per 40 g of cement powder). With the articulating spacer in place, partial weight bearing with crutches and continuous passive motion daily up to a flexion of 90 degrees are allowed. Usually, reimplantation with a standard revision system is scheduled for 6-12 weeks after spacer implantation. In a prospective study 33 consecutive patients were treated from February 2000 to July 2003. The average period of hospitalization after spacer implantation was 14 days (8-26 days). Three patients had recurrent infection (success rate 91%) after a mean follow-up period of 28 months (12-48 months). The average Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score could be increased from 67 points (44-84 points) preoperatively to 87 points (53-97 points) after reimplantation.

It avoids the drawbacks of screw fixation particularly in respect to the growth plate. Potentially all epiphyseo-metaphyseal fractures in children. None. Crossing of the growth cartilage by small pins (&lt; 2 mm) is without consequences under the condition that no compression is applied and that correction of a faulty pin position is limited to one. In general, two threaded pins are used. They are inserted in a divergent fashion after the fracture has been reduced. Percutaneous insertion is possible. An adjustable lock screwed on a special key is slid over the end of the pin and put in contact with bone. It is squeezed until the key breaks off. The pins are then shortened. Since November 1999 these pins have been used for six olecranon fractures. In January 2002 we extended the indication to other fracture sites. Between January 2002 and July 2003 this system has been used 37 times (six olecranon fractures, eleven lateral condylar fractures and 13 medial epicondylar fractures of the elbow, and seven fractures of the ankle).

The assessment of results was based on technical, radiographic, and functional aspects. The overall results were good, in particular in respect to the stability of implants and the functional results. No secondary displacement, nor nonunion were observed; the pins were removed in all children at 6 weeks. The ease of handling the implants and the good clinical and radiologic results led us to propose these pins for routine use in epiphyseal and epiphyseo-metaphyseal fractures in children.
