The COVID-19 infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly transmissible, pathogenic, and considered an ongoing global health emergency. The emergence of COVID-19 globally and the lack of adequate treatment brought attention towards herbal medicines, and scientists across the globe instigated the search for novel drugs from medicinal plants and natural products to tackle this deadly virus. The natural products rich in scaffold diversity and structural complexity are an excellent source for antiviral drug discovery. Recently the investigation of several natural products and their synthetic derivatives resulted in the identification of promising anti SARS-CoV-2 agents. This review article will highlight the pharmacological relevance and chemical synthesis of the recently discovered natural product and their synthetic analogs as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The summarized information will pave the path for the natural product-based drug discovery of safe and potent antiviral agents, particularly against SARS-CoV-2.","1":null,"2":"SARS-CoV-2 virus during its spread in the last one and half year has picked up critical changes in its genetic code i.e. mutations, which have leads to deleterious epidemiological characteristics. Due to critical role of spike protein in cell entry and pathogenesis, mutations in spike regions have been reported to enhance transmissibility, disease severity, possible escape from vaccine-induced immune response and reduced diagnostic sensitivity\/specificity. Considering the structure-function impact of mutations, understanding the molecular details of these key mutations of newly emerged variants\/lineages is of urgent concern. In this review, we have explored the literature on key spike mutations harbored by alpha, beta, gamma and delta 'variants of concern' (VOCs) and discussed their molecular consequences in the context of resultant virus biology. Commonly all these VOCs i.e. B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and B.1.617.2 lineages have decisive mutation in Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) region and\/or region around Furin cleavage site (FCS) of spike protein. In general, mutation induced disruption of intra-molecular interaction enhances molecular flexibility leading to exposure of spike protein surface in these lineages to make it accessible for inter-molecular interaction with hACE2. A disruption of spike antigen-antibody inter-molecular interactions in epitope region due to the chemical nature of substituting amino acid hampers the neutralization efficacy. Simplified surveillance of mutation induced changes and their consequences at molecular level can contribute in rationalizing mutation's impact on virus biology. It is believed that molecular level dissection of these key spike mutation will assist the future investigations for a more resilient outcome against severity of COVID-19.","3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":"The European dependencies for raw materials supply from foreign countries have been unquestionably shown by COVID-19 outbreak and have become particular evident from the slow response to the need for high quality personal protective equipment (PPEs). Among all medical devices, surgical face masks have earned themselves a primary role for the containment of the epidemic. In this context, our work aims at improving the barrier effect of surgical mask by depositing on their external surface a mixture of bioactive compounds, mainly polyphenols, extracted from agronomical sources. The main objective is the integration of the biorefining of agri-food solid wastes with the potential virucidal properties of the polyphenolic extracts for the treatment of PPEs.","8":"COVID-19 facts and literature are discussed into chemical science intuition highlighting the direct role of chemistry to the ongoing global pandemic by covering structural identification of the virus, chemical preventive measures and development of drugs. We reviewed the four most promising repurposed drugs which are presently being investigated in mass clinical trials on COVID-19 infected persons and synthetic routes of these drugs with their recent advancement. Chemical preventive measures such as soap water, hand sanitizer and disinfectant are the only available options in the arsenal to fight against COVID-19, till an effective medicine or vaccine will be made available. As such the present review will focus on the mode of action of the major chemical preventives.","9":null,"10":"SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been recognized the causative agent of the recent and ongoing pandemic. Effective and specific antiviral agents or vaccines are still missing, despite a large plethora of compounds have been proposed and tested worldwide. New compounds are requested urgently and virtual screening can offer fast and robust predictions to investigate. Moreover, natural compounds were shown to exert antiviral effects and can be endowed with limited side effects and wide availability. Our approach consisted in the validation of a docking protocol able to refine the most suitable candidates, within the 31000 natural compounds of the natural product activity and species source (NPASS) library, interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein. After the refinement process two natural compounds, castanospermine and karuquinone B, were shown to be the best-in-class derivatives in silico able to target an essential structure of the virus and to act in the early stage of infection.","11":null,"12":"Wuhan, a city of China, is the epicenter for the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). It has become a severe public health challenge to the world and established a public health emergency of international worry. This infectious disease has pulled down the economy of almost all top developed nations. The coronaviruses (CoVs) known for various epidemics caused time to time. Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses. The antiviral drugs and their clinical advances, along with herbal medicines for viral inhibition and immunity boosters, are described. Elaboration of tables related to CoVs for the compilation of the literature has been adopted for the better understanding.","13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":"We used a progressive elimination strategy to identify oocyte-specific WEE2 kinase inhibitors for potential non-hormonal contraceptives that target meiosis. Beginning with an in-house library of over 300,000 compounds, virtual high throughput screening identified 57 WEE2 inhibitors with preferential predicted binding over the somatic variant WEE1. Seven compounds were further evaluated in vitro by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure biochemical inhibition on WEE1 and WEE2 phosphorylation of CDK1. To assess specificity, we evaluated WEE2-mediated inhibition of meiosis using in vitro oocyte fertilization, and WEE1-mediated inhibition of mitosis using a somatic cell proliferation assay. Our results from these assays identified three candidates for further development: 6-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-((4-(2-(diethylamino)ethoxy) phenyl)amino)-8-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (2), 6-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-8-methyl-2-((4-morpholinophenyl) amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (12), and 3-((6-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-8-methyl-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)amino)benzoic acid (16).","17":null,"18":null,"19":"Phosphate groups are often crucial to biological activity and interactions of oligonucleotides, but confer poor membrane permeability. In addition, the group's lability to enzymatic hydrolysis is an obstacle to its use in therapeutics and in biological tools. We present the synthesis of N-oxyamide and squaramide modifications at the 5'-end of oligonucleotides as phosphate replacements and their biological evaluation using the 5'-exonuclease SNM1A. The squaryl diamide modification showed minimal recognition as a 5'-phosphate mimic; however, modest inhibition of SNM1A, postulated to occur through metal coordination at the active site, was observed. Their facile incorporation after solid-phase synthesis and recognition by the exonuclease makes squaryl diamides attractive neutral 5'-phosphate replacements for oligonucleotides. This work is the first example of squaryl diamide modifications at the 5'-terminal position of oligonucleotides and of the potential use of modified oligonucleotides to bind to the metal center of SNM1A.","20":"Nucleosides containing ester groups that are sensitive to nucleophiles were incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) through solid phase chemical synthesis. The sensitive esters are located on a purine nucleobase. They are the esters of ethyl, 2-methoxyethyl, 4-methoxyphenyl and phenyl groups, and a thioester. These esters cannot survive the deprotection and cleavage conditions used in known ODN synthesis technologies, which involve strong nucleophiles such as ammonium hydroxide and potassium methoxide (potassium carbonate in anhydrous methanol). To incorporate these sensitive groups into ODNs, the Dmoc phosphoramidites and linker were used for solid phase synthesis, which allowed ODN deprotection and cleavage to be carried out under non-nucleophilic oxidative conditions. Sixteen ODN sequences containing these groups were synthesized and characterized with MALDI MS. In addition, the synthesis and characterization of three ODNs containing a nucleophile sensitive 6-chloropurine using the same strategy are described.","21":"Herein we report a microwave assisted, fungal (Ganoderma lucidum) extract mediated synthesis of noble metal decorated reduced graphene oxide(r-GO). The carbon to oxygen ratio increased from 1.46 in GO to 2.72 in r-GO. The electron rate transfer capabilities of Pt, Pd, Ru, Pt-Pd and Pt- Ru decorated r- GO were tested in ferri-ferro coupling reaction. Excellent electrochemical behaviour were observed in their ability to oxidize hydrazine, reduce H2O2, as well as oxygen reduction in alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in acidic medium. These reactions represent diverse applications in energy production, storage, electrochemical sensing and electro catalysis, thus the method presented here can be quite useful in diverse applications.","22":"Platensimycin (PTM) is an excellent natural product drug lead against various gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. In this study, twenty PTM derivatives with varying aminobenzoic acids were semisynthesized. In contrast to all the previous reported inactive aminobenzaote analogues, a few of them showed moderate antibacterial activities against S. aureus. Our study suggested that modification of the conserved aminobenzoic acid remains a viable approach to diversify the PTM scaffold.","23":"Benzimidazoles and quinoxalinones are present in the core of many pharmacologically relevant compounds. Several combinatorial methods have been developed to attach ring systems to both scaffolds for derivatization at select positions. Herein, we describe the development of novel constrained heterocyclic compounds attached to the N1 position of both benzimidazole and quinoxalinone scaffolds. Utilizing robust post-Ugi cyclization methods, including the Ugi-deprotection-cyclization (UDC) methodology, allows for efficient access to a new area of chemical space. Additionally, molecular modeling and in cellulo screening was employed to therapeutically validate the compounds formed with this method.","24":null,"25":null,"26":"Several new 1,1'-bis(sulfonyl)ferrocenes designed for the synthesis of sulfonamide linked biological conjugates have been prepared. 1,1'-Bis(sulfonylbromide)ferrocene can be produced from the corresponding sulfonylchloride via a bis(sulfonylhydrazide) intermediate. Bis(sulfonyl-N-hydroxybenzotriazole)ferrocene can also be synthesized from the sulfonyl chloride, and reaction of glycine methyl ester with the sulfonyl chloride affords a [3]ferrocenophane complex. All new compounds have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography.","27":"Nucleic acid aptamers (NAAs) are short synthetic DNA or RNA molecules that specifically fold into distinct three-dimensional structures able to specifically recognize a target. While NAAs show unprecedented promise in a variety of applications, including sensing, therapeutics and diagnostics, one major limitation involves the lack of stability towards omnipresent nucleases. Therefore, we herein report a systematic truncation and incorporation of 2'-O-methyl bases to a DNA aptamer, which results in increased stability without affecting affinity. One of the newly designed analogues is stable up to 24 hours, demonstrating that 2'-O-methyl RNA is an attractive modification to DNA aptamers, especially when therapeutic applications are intended.","28":null,"29":"Hindered O-tert-alkyl N-arylcarbamates were conveniently prepared by treating arylamines with aryl tert-alkyl carbonates in the presence of a strong base. The new method avoids the use of sensitive and difficult-to-access dialkyl dicarbonates and isocyanates, which are most commonly used in known methods. Instead, the stable and readily accessible alkyl aryl carbonates are used. Therefore, the new method is particularly suitable for the synthesis of N-arylcarbamates that contain a complex O-alkyl moiety. Using the method, electron-rich and electron-poor, and primary and secondary arylamines can all be conveniently converted to their carbamates with acceptable yields. The method was also found equally effective for the synthesis of the less hindered O-secondary and O-primary alkyl N-arylcarbamates.","30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":"NMR hyperpolarization via Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE) was employed to investigate the feasibility of enhancing the NMR detection sensitivity of sulfur-heterocycles (specifically 2-methylthiophene and dibenzothiophenes), a family of compounds typically found in petroleum and refined petroleum products. SABRE hyperpolarization of sulfur-heterocycles (conducted in seconds) offers potential advantages of providing structural information about sulfur-containing contaminants in petroleum, thereby informing petroleum purification and refining to minimize sulfur content in refined products such as gasoline. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy sensitivity gains endowed by hyperpolarization potentially allows for performing structural assays using inexpensive, low-magnetic-field (ca. 1 T) high-resolution NMR spectrometers ideally suited for industrial applications in the field.","36":"Mass spectrometry (MS)-based multi-omic measurements, including proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics, are increasingly transforming our ability to characterize and understand biological systems. Multi-omic analyses and the desire for comprehensive measurement coverage presently have limitations due to the chemical diversity and range of abundances of biomolecules in complex samples. Advances addressing these challenges increasingly are based upon the ability to quickly separate, react and otherwise manipulate sample components for analysis by MS. Here we report on a new approach using Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations (SLIM) to enable long serpentine path ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) separations followed by MS analyses. This approach provides previously unachieved resolution for biomolecular species, in conjunction with more effective ion utilization, and a basis for greatly improved characterization of very small sample sizes.","37":"The terpenoids constitute one of the largest and most diverse classes of natural compounds with applications as pharmaceuticals, flavorings and fragrances, pesticides and biofuels. Synthetic biology is ideally placed to create new routes to this chemical diversity and facilitation of new compound discovery. The C10 monoterpenoids display a huge structural diversity produced from a single substrate, geranyl diphosphate, by a family of monoterpene cyclases and synthases (mTC\/S). Here we employ a library of mTC\/S in a single 'plug and play' platform system for the production of over 30 different monoterpenoids in Escherichia coli by fermentation on glucose. These products include several compounds never before produced in engineered microbes demonstrating the power of this approach to rapidly create routes to structural diversity."},"articletitle":{"0":"An Update on Pharmacological Relevance and Chemical Synthesis of Natural Products and Derivatives with Anti SARS-CoV-2 Activity.","1":"Comparative MD Study of
