planning long-term care facilities (LTCFs), architects strive to design buildings that support high well-being (WB) levels for those who live and work in them. To achieve this goal, architects must understand what defines WB in old age and how these qualities can be achieved through the designed physical layout. This task must be achieved while tackling additional challenges, such as considering the official planning guidelines, codes, and additional requests given by the client. During the planning process, architects use their subjective impressions by visiting similar institutions, their personal experience as architects, and their subjective assumptions on what residents and caregivers may consider desirable. Once built, there are a lack of methodological ways to evaluate an existing LTCF unit's plan as a supportive tool for higher levels of WB. The current study aims to create a methodological tool to analyze LTCF units' layout, giving scores to each plan based on five aspects of WB that they support. In our article, we demonstrate this methodology's application on 40 plans of LTCFs, demonstrating its effectiveness. We believe that the approach presented in this article will contribute to furthering the quality of planning of LTCFs benefiting residents and caregivers alike.","1":"","2":"","3":"Emergency departments (EDs) have been struggling with overcrowding issues for years. Some spatial configurations have been proposed to improve ED performance in facing overcrowding. Despite similarities with mass casualty incidents (MCIs), when demand for care exceeds the capacity, little is documented about the application of the proposed configurations during MCIs to improve surge capacity. We aimed to explore the potential of spatial configurations that have been proposed to handle ED overcrowding in daily operations so as to improve surge capacity during MCIs. Using an online Likert-scale survey, 11 spatial design strategies were rated by ED care teams in terms of their potential to improve surge capacity during MCIs. Responses from 72 participants revealed that establishing an in-house lab was perceived as the most potential strategy, followed by rapid care area, internal waiting rooms, and in-house imaging. In contrast, separate entrance and exit doors, as well as decentralized nurse stations, were perceived as the least potential strategies but also exhibited the most variance in response. Respondents' comments implied that their choice of in-house ancillary services was primarily to improve communication and to reduce turnaround time and risk of errors. Their choice of rapid care and internal waiting areas related to improved flexibility. Understanding clinicians' perspectives on potentially effective spatial configurations aids in implementing balanced strategies to better equip EDs to handle overcrowding in daily operations and manage surges during MCIs. ","4":"To (1) develop a simulation software environment to conduct prehospital research during the COVID-19 pandemic on paramedics' teamwork and use of mobile computing devices, and (2) establish its feasibility for use as a research and training tool. Simulation-based research and training for prehospital environments has typically used live simulation, with highly realistic equipment and technology-enhanced manikins. However, such simulations are expensive, difficult to replicate, and require facilitators and participants to be at the same location. Although virtual simulation tools exist for prehospital care, it is unclear how best to use them for research and training. We present SPECTRa-Simulated Prehospital Emergency Care for Team Research-an online simulated prehospital environment that lets participants care concurrently for single or multiple patients remotely. Patient scenarios are designed using Laerdal's SimDesigner. SPECTRa records data about scenario states and participants' virtual interaction with the simulated patients. SPECTRa's supporting environment records participants' verbal communication and their visual and physical interactions with their interface and devices using Zoom conferencing and audiovisual recording. We discuss a pilot research implementation to assess SPECTRa's feasibility. SPECTRa allows researchers to systematically test small-team interaction in single- or multipatient care scenarios and assess the impact of mobile devices on participants' assessment and care of patients. SPECTRa also supports pedagogical features that could allow prehospital educators to provide individual trainees or teams with online simulation training and evaluation. SPECTRa, an online tool for simulating prehospital patient care, shows potential for remote healthcare research and training. ","5":"To explore how nurses experience the physical environment when caring for hospitalized patients. The physical environment as part of nursing is already an embedded understanding in the earliest nursing theory. In today's hospitals, the impact of the physical environment is important for both patients and nurses. Patients' well-being is linked to the physical environment, which can produce both negative and positive emotions. Nurses' work environment is affected by the physical one, which affects practice, communication, and teamwork. This study used a qualitative design to explore nurses' experiences of the physical environment in nursing. The study complied with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ). Individual interviews were conducted with nine nurses working in somatic hospital units. Data collection, analysis, and interpretation consisted of individual semi-structured interviews and meaning condensation as described by Kvale and Brinkmann. Three themes were identified: (1) providing a place to belong, (2) offering a protective sensory shield, and (3) balancing clinical needs with the patients' personal needs. Involvement of the physical environment in nursing provides an opportunity for nurses to offer the hospitalized patient a place to belong. However, the physical environment is important for nurses to maintain accessibility with, and visualization of the patient. It is a careful balancing act carried out in practice without further verbalization in nursing. ","6":"Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) with compact, group-living arrangements have become COVID-19 hot spots during the pandemic. Systematic research is needed to understand factors associated with COVID-19 infections in LTCFs and the inadvertent effects of preventive measures adopted by LTCFs. This rapid review identifies factors associated with LTCF residents' COVID-19 infections and the impacts of the pandemic and the corresponding preventive measures on residents' mental health and behavioral problems. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, we identified and reviewed relevant literature in Medline, PsycINFO, and AgeLine. Thirty-seven articles were identified and reviewed, including 30 reporting factors associated with COVID-19 infections in LTCFs and seven reporting the impact of the pandemic and corresponding prevention measures on LTCF residents. Results revealed four domains of factors associated with COVID-19 infections: facility physical environments, resident characteristics, facility management and testing, and community factors. The pandemic and infection control measures increased residents' depression, anxiety, loneliness, and behavioral problems (e.g., agitation, hallucinations). Residents without cognitive impairments were more vulnerable to these adverse effects. LTCF managers\/policymakers and healthcare designers can help mitigate COVID-19 infections by (1) providing additional resources to vulnerable LTCFs; (2) enhancing the training of personal protective equipment use and guideline compliance; and (3) investing in amenities, such as sinks, quarantine rooms, and outdoor spaces. Digital activities and accessible green spaces can mitigate mental health and behavior issues. Future LTCF design can benefit from flexible spaces, natural ventilation, and reducing crowding. ","7":"To describe the planning, development, and implementation of a structured video-based observational method that can be used to systematically examine and model the role of the physical environment within healthcare systems. Direct observation methods are often used in healthcare to study complex healthcare systems. However, these observations often occur in real time, which predisposes the collected data to shortcomings such as time lags in recording of activities, overlooking events, or limiting the scope of information than can be collected. Video observation approaches eliminate many of these challenges and provide opportunities for researchers to understand and model the role of the physical environment. An approach to developing and implementing a structured video-based observational method to study and model complex health systems is presented. A structured observational approach can be highly effective for collecting multiple layers of data necessary for understanding interactions between the physical environment and other systems components in healthcare settings. The proposed video-based observation method is effective in settings that have clearly defined environmental boundaries, limited number of people, are complex and fast-paced such as the OR, ED trauma rooms, and ICU rooms. Video-based observation is an effective complement to the traditional observational method for in-depth study of the built environment in health systems, enabling researchers to employ quantitative approaches to data collection and analysis, in addition to qualitative interpretations. ","8":"A comparative study was undertaken to survey nurses working in an acute care nursing unit before and after moving to a new hospital to investigate the impact of a nursing unit designed utilizing Planetree build criteria. The physical and emotional demands of frontline practitioners is a serious concern for patient safety and staff retention as the environmental design of nursing units can influence human errors from fatigue and interruption. A pre-move survey was conducted with acute care nurses in a conventional design nursing unit who were moving to a new facility. After the move to the new hospital design, the same survey was readministered to obtain comparative performance information. Qualitative responses were analyzed for triangulation with survey responses. Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) and Press Ganey scores were collected over a 5-year period. There were statistically significant improvements for most of the survey questions, especially for work efficiency and productivity, the design of the patient room and of support spaces, the information systems, and the environmental conditions. There were statistically significant improvements in the HCHAPS and Press Ganey survey questions. The postoccupancy survey showed statistically significant improvements in most of the concerns highlighted in the pre-move survey and significant improvements in the workflow and overall satisfaction of nurses. Press Ganey results revealed all but five domains fell in the significantly improved category. ","9":"This study explores the specialized nursing requirements of different clinical departments and their influence on the design of nursing units, which ultimately improves the nursing staff's efficiency and work experience. Specialization of nursing work is important in the provision of quality of healthcare. Most of the research related to nursing units has focuses on general medical-surgical nursing units and has not differentiated between clinical departments. This study was conducted in one inpatient building at a large general hospital in China. Survey data were collected from 11 clinical departments via questionnaire, and interviews were conducted in 10 of the clinical departments. All 11 clinical departments had significant differences in their evaluations of and requirements for the arrangement of their physical space. Specialized requirements were found in three areas: nursing work processes, arrangement and needs of clinical spaces, and allocation of facilities and equipment. Evaluation of the specialized requirements of different clinical departments would contribute to the body of knowledge on nursing unit design and has a positive effect on the development and improvement of design theory. Suggestions for how the design of nursing units could be improved to support the specialized demands of different departments are provided. ","10":"This article aims to illustrate the design considerations of team-based primary care clinics in response to the pandemic. Due to COVID-19, physical distancing became a critical practice in our daily life, especially in healthcare settings where healthcare professionals must continue providing care to patients despite the manifold risks. Many healthcare facilities are implementing physical distancing in their clinic layouts, and healthcare professionals are adjusting their behaviors, so they can stay away from each other. A total of four team-based primary care clinics were studied to identify their lessons learned regarding safety measures and space usage during the pandemic. The four team-based primary care clinics made changes to the clinic design (e.g., waiting areas, exam rooms, team workspaces), operational protocols (e.g., in-person huddles, social gatherings, staff work locations), and usage of spaces (e.g., outdoor spaces, utility rooms). Such changes enabled the implementation of safety measures during the pandemic. However, healthcare professionals also reported challenges regarding their team communication and coordination due to physical distancing and separation. Our findings suggest that the physical distancing may in fact contribute to less effective teamwork and patient care and negatively affect staff well-being. In this article, we ask healthcare system leaders and designers to continue supporting both safety and teamwork by paying attention to the flexibility and spatial relationships among healthcare professionals rather than fully sacrificing teamwork for safety. Also, now is the time when multidisciplinary collaborations are needed to establish and validate guidelines that can improve both factors. ","11":"To provide a taxonomy of spatial observation methods that are commonly used in healthcare environments research and to describe their relative success. Spatial observation is a valuable but resource intensive research method that is often used in healthcare environments research, but which frequently fails to deliver conclusive results. There is no existing catalog of the different spatial and behavioral observation methods that are used in healthcare design research and their benefits or limitations. The review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Ten key databases were searched, and articles were screened by both authors. Across 67 included studies, 79 observation methods were reported. We categorized those into four, distinct methodological approaches, outlining the benefits, limitations, and suitability of each for obtaining different types of results. Common limitations included difficulty generalizing to other contexts and a lack of detailed description during data collection which led to key environment variables not being recorded. More concrete conclusions were drawn when observation methods were combined with complimentary methods such as interview. The relative success of spatial observation studies is dependent on the fit of the method selected relative to the research question, approach, and healthcare setting; any complimentary methods delivered alongside it; and the analysis model employed. This article provides researchers with practical advice to guide the appropriate selection of spatial observation methods. ","12":"This article presents an opportunistic case with particular focus on instances from an extended procurement operation in which medical professionals run a proactive process involving the generation of layouts through distinct modes of representational practices without any actual collaboration with designers. The questions of inquiry involve an analysis on how the visualizations came into being and a discussion into the content of drawings that was shaped by individuals without any formal design education. Although the literature introduces examples of genuine participation, particularly in healthcare design practices, the instances in which nondesigners demonstrate accomplished skills in spatial reasoning and representation are limited. The research was formulated as a qualitative case study including a series of observations of the activities of the participants followed by interviews recorded at different locations. The investigation also focuses on the features of these authentic graphics which illustrate the intentions of the medical professionals concerning the function of spaces. In this research, the participants went through a labor intensive and elaborate effort to produce \"architectural representations\" with the intention to convey their implicit professional expertise in the domain. The layouts were introduced to be the vital elements to visualize the implicit knowledge regarding the functioning of space. The productive and creative engagement of clinicians within this research makes the case for a multidisciplinary approach that reframes the limits and potential contributions of participants alongside drawings, which are exclusively claimed by and strategically employed by architects as negotiation devices within participatory design processes. ","13":"The objective of this study is present how a patient movement-based patient-flow analysis is performed for planning the new Heart Hospital of Tampere University Hospital and how patient transfer distances can be shortened by this method. The Heart Hospital had served patients as a service line organization for years. However, the Heart Hospital layout rather looked like functional layout instead of service line layout because the units of the Heart Hospital have been spread out around the large university hospital campus. The flow routes of patients treated over the course of 1 year were analyzed by information technology systems in the hospital planning phase. Then, the proximity ranking of the main functions of the Heart Hospital was made. Layout planning was performed based on the proximity ranking. Nine months after the opening of the new Heart Hospital, the distances between the various hospital functions were calculated for the old Heart Hospital and the new one. In the old Heart Hospital, patients' transfer distance was 5,654 km (3,513 miles), while the corresponding figure for the new Heart Hospital was 3,797 km (2,359 miles), which means the distance was reduced by 33%. The patient-flow analysis works as it generated substantially shorter patient transfer distances in the new Heart Hospital. Shorter distances have supported more fluent patient flows that, in turn, has contributed higher productivity and quality of care. ","14":"This study assessed the perception of people toward drive-through healthcare services, their willingness to use them, and the scope of services they would like to receive in a post-pandemic world. The abrupt spread of COVID-19 urged healthcare facilities to adopt new infection-control measures. Drive-through testing facilities were implemented as one of the measures to minimize physical contact between healthcare workers and test-takers. Many studies describe drive-through models' merits, but people's opinions about them as a permanent attachment to healthcare facilities are unclear. An online survey was distributed through snowball sampling. The survey solicited feedback from adults who lived in the United States. The survey consisted of Likert-type and multiple-choice questions and was completed by176 eligible participants. The use of drive-through pharmacies increased after the spread of COVID-19. Most people agreed drive-through healthcare services could be more convenient and safer to use. People prefer to have their vitals checked, and vaccinations received in a drive-through because of the improved infection-control matters and increased comfort; however, they are neutral about the level of privacy they have and the hygiene of drive-through healthcare settings. This study shows permanent drive-throughs offering medical services benefit people in times of crisis for the perceived infection control purposes and the improved convenience. A drive-through model can redefine the waiting experience and serve as a new safe triage system in urgent care centers. Drive-through urgent care centers can be adopted as a hybrid of telemedicine and in-person visits. ","15":"Natural views are an important design strategy for the application of ecological resources in built environments. Numerous clinical studies have indicated that views of nature-for example, plants-can effectively promote patient recovery by relieving their postoperative pains and negative emotions during hospitalization. This study demonstrates an intelligent method that develops algorithms of using collision detection techniques in Building Information Modeling to evaluate outdoor plant visibility for patients. These algorithms are digitized into a Revit plug-in program, which can be viewed as a design-aided tool for architects with the purpose of informing healthcare environment design in the decision-making process. Its acceptability and effectiveness are evaluated based on the consultations in beta tests. It is believed that this method can improve the work efficiency of evaluating natural views in wards and help architects implement an informed design of built environments for better health performance. All findings in this study can contribute to the development of computational intelligence and social sustainability in the near future. ","16":"This article compares national standards for area measurements of healthcare facilities in four countries and examines the risks and differences that can arise when comparing building areas of healthcare facilities internationally. In the planning and management of healthcare facilities, the utilization and comparison of building floor areas plays a major role. Differences in terminology, classification, and methodology help to reduce planning and cost risks when applied on a local and national level. The proper allocation of building floor space is vital in the design of room programs, determination of floor space, construction costs, and operating costs. Each of the four hospital area measurement standards is compared to discern similarities and differences. Most countries use a three-tier system of hospital area measurement: building gross area, department gross area, and department net area. Few differences were found between country standards for department area, though the German standards do not fully address this tier. Variation is found in whether a country includes certain functions in the hospital area-such as research space, shell space, or central energy plants-which can have a significant impact on the overall hospital area. This article informs further development of individual country standards and highlights principles to consider for international hospital area comparison. ","17":"To explore women's experiences of physical features in a birthing room designed to be adaptable to personal wishes and needs during labor and birth. Childbirth is a central life event influenced by numerous factors, including the healthcare environment; however, there is insufficient knowledge on how the physical design affects women during birth. This study was part of a randomized controlled trial in the Room4Birth research project, including women randomized to receive care in a new birthing room designed with physical features changeable according to personal wishes. Data consisted of responses to two questions analyzed with descriptive statistics (n = 202) and semi-structured interviews analyzed for content (n = 19). A total of 93.6% (n = 189) assessed the physical features in the birthing room as meaningful to a very high or high extent. The overall impression of the room was positive and exceeded women's expectations. They felt welcomed and strengthened by the room, which shifted the focus to a more positive emotional state. The room differed from traditional hospital birthing rooms, contained familiar features that maintained integrity, and had space for companions. The variety of physical features was appreciated. Of nine listed physical features, the bathtub was ranked most important, followed by the projection of nature scenery, and dimmable lighting, but the room as a whole appeared most important. When planning and designing hospital-based birthing rooms, it is crucial to offer possibilities to adapt the room and physical features according to personal wishes. ","18":"To identify available literature on the impact of built environments on health, behavior, and quality of life of individuals with intellectual disabilities in long-term care. Additionally, we aimed to map the available literature, (re)frame the overall research situation in this area, and formulate recommendations. Long-term care facilities in the Netherlands are planned without using knowledge from research regarding evidence-based design because it is unclear what evidence is available about the impact of long-term care built environments on individuals with intellectual disabilities receiving 24\/7 care. Twelve scientific databases were searched for keyword combinations. After systematically screening 3,095 documents, 276 were included in the analysis. There is an underrepresentation of research and publications in intellectual disabilities, compared to other user groups living in long-term care facilities. A total of 26 design components were found in all groups; as for intellectual disabilities, research was available on only seven of them. Community care, home-likeness, and variety seem to have a positive effect on health, behavior, and quality of life. There are conflicting results regarding the effects of house size. Although individuals with intellectual disabilities live in long-term care facilities, sometimes for life, little research has been conducted on the impact of the built environment on them. In the future, more empirical research should be conducted, addressing all aspects of quality of life and specific design components, with hypotheses based on needs assessments and the use of good research designs. This requires an investment of time and funding. ","19":"","20":"This study examined the associations between home and community environmental factors and self-rated health (SRH) among older Canadians and how these associations vary by gender and living arrangements. Background: In social gerontology research, the psychosocial determinants of SRH have been widely investigated. Based on the environmental gerontology framework, this study examined the home and community environmental correlates of SRH. The sample (aged 60 or older) was drawn from the 2018 Canadian Housing Survey (4,086 men living alone; 6,471 men living with others; 9,170 women living alone; 4,876 women living with others). Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between SRH and potential environmental correlates in a hierarchical model. Findings show that older men and women living alone reported lower levels of SRH than those living with others. Regression findings show common and unique home and community environmental predictors of SRH by group. Common predictors of higher SRH were private housing residence, larger living space, satisfaction with dwelling, volunteering, no perceived need for community services, and community safety. Home maintenance needs predicted lower SRH among older men and women living with others; uninhabitable conditions predicted poor SRH among older men living with others and older women living alone. Results support the important effects of place in terms of home and community environments for older adults' SRH, and associations differed by gender and living arrangements. ","21":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the total number of hospital beds in the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi was 54,321 (roughly 300 beds per one lakh population), which was inadequate for the patients. Therefore, the Indian government initiated the construction of a 1,000-bedded greenfield hangar-based hospital to bridge the healthcare gap. As a result, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in the facility augmented the COVID-19 care ICU beds in the city by 11%. The authors were involved in the planning, developing, and initiating the functioning of 1,000-bedded Dedicated COVID-19 Hospital (DCH). The hospital was conceptualized, built, and operationalized in 12 days only. Lessons learned from this experience would be of benefit should similar situations arise in future. Coordinating structural designing early with the entire project team-from facility administrators and medical practitioners to architects, consultants, and contractors-can result in a structure that better matches the facility's long-term needs and often saves construction time and costs. This article enumerates various challenges faced and the way they were addressed. This hangar-based hospital can be rapidly constructed and deployed on a massive scale. While structural integrity is essential, the planning team was particularly aware of the patient-centric modality of healthcare. Many modifications were carried out in the structure based on patient inputs. Informal discussions with discharged patients and relatives revealed that the human-centric approach was the mainstay of the therapy.","22":"The aim of this study was to develop built environment (BE) design knowledge to support resilient healthcare by systematically reviewing the evidence-based design (EBD) literature. Although the EBD literature is vast, it has not made explicit its contribution to resilient healthcare, which is a key component of the highly complex health service. This review followed the steps recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses method. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 43 journal papers were selected. The papers were analyzed in light of five guidelines for coping with complexity, allowing for the development of BE design knowledge that supports resilient healthcare. The design knowledge compiled by the review was structured according to four levels of abstraction: five design-meta principles, corresponding to the five complexity guidelines, seven design principles, 21 design prescriptions, and 58 practical examples. The design knowledge emphasizes the interactions between the BE as physical infrastructure and the functions that it supports. The design knowledge is expected to be useful not only to architects but also to those involved in the functional design of health services as they interact with the BE. Furthermore, our proposal provides a knowledge template that can be continuously updated based on the experience of practitioners and academic research. ","23":"This study investigated Chinese nurses' preferences for (a) proximity of break areas, (b) functionality of break areas, (c) amenities, and (d) nature-related environmental features. While nurses in China need support to adequately perform their jobs, little is known about how restorative spaces impact their mental and physical health. Data were collected through interviews (N = 12), survey questionnaires (N = 88), and visual assessments (N = 88) from nurses who worked in inpatient settings in China. Nurses preferred the break room to be close to nursing stations; to have visual privacy from patients; and to provide space and facilities for drinking, taking naps, dining, and chatting with colleagues. Balconies and windows were shown to have a significant restorative effect. Well-designed break areas were perceived to have positive impacts on nurse perceived levels of well-being and increase nurses' satisfaction levels with their work environment. The study outcomes emphasize the importance of restorative spaces for inpatient nurses and recommend including natural elements in the break rooms. ","24":"","25":"A methodology to assess the impact of involving end users in therapeutic activities to address the hospital physical environment is provided. The impact of participating in a recreational art creation program with the aim of developing an art installation on the immediate feelings of participants and their perception of the physical rehabilitation environment (PPRE) and motivation to participate in rehabilitation (MPR) is investigated. Rehabilitation unit design has largely excluded the perspectives of end users with disability. Including their aesthetic design contributions moves beyond contemporary approaches where their perspectives are considered. A two-period, mixed-methods pre-post intervention design involving within and between group comparisons is proposed. During Period 1, program participants and nonparticipants completed admission (T1) and discharge (T2) surveys including PPRE and MPR measures developed by the authors. Surveys pre and post each art session were completed. The art installation will be implemented within unit corridors. Period 2 participants will complete a T1 survey and their physical environment perceptions compared to Period 1 participants. Participating in the recreational art program significantly improved immediate levels of calmness, happiness, pain, and physical health. There is a positive relationship between environment perception and rehabilitation motivation. People with disability should be actively involved in healthcare environment design. Arts-based programs have relevance to people with neurological injury as it promotes essential sensory stimulation. The methodology and findings can encourage further work which involves end users in the design of healthcare environments and evaluates the impact of their involvement. ","26":"","27":"To contribute staff perspectives on the design of palliative care facilities to better align with the philosophy of palliative care, in support of patient, family, and staff well-being. The receipt of palliative care differs from other inpatient experiences owing to its distinct philosophy of care, longer lengths of stay, a greater presence of family members, and more frequent end-of-life events. While research regarding the optimal design of palliative care environments recognizes these differences, this knowledge has been slow to exert change on the guidelines and procurement processes that determine the design solutions possible within these settings. Sustained research attention is required. An online survey, comprising a series of open-ended questions, elicited the perceptions of palliative care staff regarding the relationship between the physical environment and the distinct philosophy of palliative care. Responses from 89 Australian-based palliative care professionals confirmed the high value that staff place on environments that offer privacy, homeliness, safety, and access to gardens to assist the delivery of optimum care. Our findings illustrate that the implications of privacy and homeliness extend far beyond the patient room and that homeliness is about more than an aesthetic of comfort. This highlights a broader capacity for design to better support the philosophy of palliative care. Importantly, the data reveal a key relationship between staff well-being and the environments in which they work; environments that are unable to match the quality of care that staff aspire to deliver can engender frustration and distress. ","28":"The purpose of this scoping review is to identify evidence on how characteristics of healing architecture in clinical contexts impact clinical practice and patient experiences. Based on these insights, we advance a more practice-based approach to the study of how healing architectures work. The notion of \"healing architecture\" has recently emerged in discussions of the spatial organization of healthcare settings, particularly in the Nordic countries. This scoping review summarizes findings from seven articles which specifically describe how patients and staff experience characteristics of healing architecture. This scoping review was conducted using the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. We referred to the decision tool developed by Pollock et al. to confirm that this approach was the most appropriate evidence synthesis type to identify characteristics related to healing architecture and practice. To ensure the rigor of this review, we referred to the methodological guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews. There are two main findings of the review. First, there is no common or operative definition of healing architecture used in the selected articles. Secondly, there is limited knowledge of how healing architecture shapes clinical and patient outcomes. We conclude that further research is needed into how healing architectures make a difference in everyday clinical practices, both to better inform the development of evidence-based designs in the future and to further elaborate criteria to guide postoccupancy evaluations of purpose-built sites. ","29":"Navigating large hospitals can be very challenging due to the functional complexity as well as the evolving changes and expansions of such facilities. Hospital wayfinding issues could lead to stress, negative mood, and poor healthcare experience among patients, staff, and family members. A survey-embedded experiment was conducted using immersive virtual environment (IVE) techniques to explore people's wayfinding performance and their mood and spatial experience in hospital circulation spaces with or without visible greenspaces. Seventy-four participants were randomly assigned to either group to complete wayfinding tasks in a timed session. Participants' wayfinding performances were interpreted using several indicators, including task completion, duration, walking distance, stop, sign-viewing, and route selection. Participants' mood states and perceived environmental attractiveness and atmosphere were surveyed; their perceived levels of presence in the IVE hospitals were also reported. The results revealed that participants performed better on high complexity wayfinding tasks in the IVE hospital with visible greenspaces, as indicated by less time consumed and shorter walking distance to find the correct destination, less frequent stops and sign viewing, and more efficient route selection. Participants also experienced enhanced mood states and favorable spatial experience and perceived aesthetics in the IVE hospital with visible greenspaces than the same environment without window views. IVE techniques could be an efficient tool to supplement environment-behavior studies with certain conditions noted. Hospital greenspaces located at key decision points could serve as landmarks that positively attract people's attention, aid wayfinding, and improve their navigational experience.

China, as a country that found the COVID-19 earlier, has taken strict control measures. However, as the medical building system is not perfect enough to prevent and control sudden infectious diseases. First, expert group methodology was used and evaluation index of ability of prevention and control of sudden infectious diseases in medical building system was selected; then fuzzy comprehensive evaluation was adopted to establish index set and to set weight and medical building system evaluation model for prevention and control of sudden infectious diseases was constructed; finally, it's to modify the indicators and weights in the evaluation set and to make an evaluation of the ability of Harbin medical building system to prevent and control sudden infectious diseases in accordance with the current management mode of system. The medical building system in Harbin is significantly unbalanced in its ability to prevent sudden infections where there are low indicators for response monitoring and forecasting terminals, there are high indicators for the construction of emergency center. The evaluation model of the ability of medical building system to prevent and control sudden infectious diseases was constructed. The model is adopted to make practical evaluation of infectious disease prevention and control ability in Harbin and to form the evaluation method of the direct connection between the theoretical research of medical architecture and medical building design. ","34":"The objective of this case study is to demonstrate the value of applying tabletop and simulation techniques to highlight high-risk, high-impact outcomes and organizational recommendations in the commissioning of a new clinical spaces. Generalizability of lessons learned from this case study aim to support other health organizations in commissioning of clinical spaces during communicable disease outbreaks. COVID-19 challenged our healthcare system, requiring teams to prepare in a short span of time. Bridging expertise of human factor and simulation teams provided a novel, interdisciplinary, and timely approach to evaluate and commission spaces. Human factors and simulation teams were enlisted to conduct an evaluation of a new space prior to readiness for delivery of safe patient care. An adapted tabletop evaluation and subsequent systems integration simulation was conducted. The goal of the tabletop exercise was to identify and define processes and risks to tested in the physical space using simulation. Applying both human factors science and systems simulation proactively identified the highest risk, highest impact outcomes, validated existing processes and allowed for refining of potential solutions and recommendations of the new space. A strong working relationship between teams fostered an opportunity to share information, debrief, evaluate, and adapt methods while applying timely changes based on emergent findings. These combined methodologies are important tools that can be learned and applied to healthcare commissioning of new clinical spaces in the identification of high-risk, high-impact outcomes affecting staff and organizational preparedness and safety. ","35":"We aim to review existing literature on the effects of background music in waiting rooms on patients. Furthermore, we examine existing neurobiological research for potential mechanisms by which music may affect patients. Music has been studied in healthcare in various forms, from formal interventions such as music therapy to passive listening as therapy. However, music is also present in the healthcare environment in the form of background music in waiting rooms. There has been interest in whether background music in such a setting may have beneficial effects on patient anxiety in order to potentially inform healthcare workers whether and what type of music may be suitable for waiting rooms. We reviewed existing literature on music in healthcare waiting rooms and the neurobiological mechanisms by which music affects anxiety. We located several small studies performed in a range of settings, including physician office waiting rooms and preoperative waiting areas. The studies generally reported that most patients viewed music in these areas positively; some, but not all, studies showed positive effects on patient anxiety. A variety of theories by which music may impact patient anxiety was noted. We conclude that there exists some evidence to support an anxiety-reducing effect of background music on patients, though studies vary widely in methodology and music selection. A small amount of neurobiological research into the pertinent mechanisms has been conducted, but further research will be required to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which this intervention may reduce anxiety. ","36":"To conduct a needs assessment with families and their healthcare team to understand the impact of restrictive family presence policies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in response to COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant restrictive family presence policies were instituted in most NICUs globally intended to protect infants, families, and HCPs. However, knowledge on the impact of the stress of the pandemic and policies restricting family presence in the NICU on vulnerable neonates and their families remains limited. Individuals were eligible to participate if they were a caregiver of an infant requiring NICU care or a healthcare provider (HCP) in the NICU after March 1, 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using a virtual communication platform, and transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic qualitative content analysis. Twenty-three participants were interviewed (12 families and 11 HCPs). Three themes emerged: (1) successes (family-integrated care, use of technology), (2) challenges (lack of standardized messaging and family engagement, impact on parental wellbeing, institutional barriers, and virtual care), and (3) moving forward (responsive and supportive leadership). Our findings highlight the significant impact of family restrictions on the mental well-being of families, physical closeness with parents, and empathetic stress to HCPs. Further study of potential long-term impact is warranted. ","37":null,"38":"The intangible value of emotions is often neglected in healthcare evaluations; however, it forms an important part of the hospital experience that needs to be taken into consideration to move toward person-centered care. This article conceptualizes how space and architecture may influence patient, family, and healthcare provider emotions. Building upon Gaston Bachelard's Poetics of Space, theories on emotional design and architecture, as well as research in environmental design, we suggest several ways to value emotions in hospital design and architecture. The first theme explores several hospital spaces (the waiting room, the hospital room, the treatment room) using Bachelard's phenomenology in order to show how to facilitate emotional security by catering to the individual needs of the user. The second discusses the overall hospital room environment, notably the influence of light, color, and sound on the patient's emotional experience. The third explores architectural theorist Giuliana Bruno's theory of e(motion) to explore the hospital space as vissuto, a space of lived experiences, that invites us to rethink the design and architecture of hospital spaces to allow for patient participation. The article also gives suggestions of qualitative, person-centered methodologies that can be used to move forward this debate.","39":"This study proposed a combined methodology to evaluate the perceived usability of healthcare seats that were first selected in a virtual waiting room which provided the context of use for the seats. There has been an increased interest in using virtual reality (VR) for evaluation of seating in interior environments. Although VR offers a less expensive approach compared to evaluating seats in situ, using VR has limitations as users cannot experience the actual seat prototypes. Participants (N = 92) experienced a virtual waiting room with various seat groupings and were prompted with four task-based scenarios through which they selected a seat. After the VR phase, they experienced their selected seats in a lab and used an online questionnaire to evaluate the seating. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to garner similarities and differences in participants' experience of virtual and real seats. Three categories including comfort, support, and flexibility were extracted from the questionnaire. While support and comfort categories were highly ranked by participants, the category rankings varied depending on participants' age, gender, tasks, and seat types. Interviews revealed that there were differences in experience of the seating materials in VR versus reality, and therefore experiencing the real seats was useful in seating evaluation. The findings suggest that the combined methodology using VR and real seating in a lab is a reliable tool for designers and furniture manufacturers to obtain users' perceived usability evaluation of seating during the design process while the actual context is absent. ","40":"This study was designed to examine how residents in long-term care (LTC) units perceive their living environment based on the theory of supportive design. Healthcare environments may cause a significant level of stress mainly due to patients' lack of familiarity with such environments and patients' poor health conditions. According to the theory, the healthcare environments providing a sense of control, social support, and positive distraction can promote wellness. This study was designed to learn how LTC residents perceive their current living environments. This study collected data through qualitative interviews. A total of 48 residents living in two LTC units were asked the three interior environments they liked and they wanted to improve. Only the residents who lived in the current space for 1 month and communicate without any cognitive disabilities were able to participate. Most residents were female and lived in a private room. The participants' responses indicated the importance of perceived control, social support, and positive distraction in the environment. The most frequently mentioned interior environment that the residents liked was \"window and view,\" followed by \"pictures and photos\" and \"TV,\" while they wanted \"bigger room and space,\" followed by \"improved privacy\" and \"more options for food.\" In addition to the three elements, the participants considered other elements as important for them which can benefit the participants. More studies must be carried out to expand the theory, so that it can be applied to future studies with inclusive perspectives. ","41":"This study explores whether \"future\" lighting systems that provide greater control and opportunity for circadian synchronization are acceptable to participants in the role of patients. Tunable, dimmable light emitting diode systems provide multiple potential benefits for healthcare. They can provide significant energy savings, support circadian synchronization by varying the spectrum and intensity of light over the course of the day, address nighttime navigation needs, and provide user-friendly control. There is an emerging understanding of the important visual and nonvisual effects of light; however, important questions remain about the experience and acceptability of this \"future\" lighting if we are to adopt it broadly. Volunteer participants (34) performed a series of tasks typical of patients, such as reading or watching a video, in a full-scale simulated inpatient room. Each participant conducted these tasks under 12 lighting conditions in a counterbalanced order that included varying illuminance levels, correlated color temperatures (CCTs), and in a few conditions, saturated colors. The participants rated each lighting condition on comfort, intensity, appropriateness, and naturalness. The participants found that conditions with CCTs of 5,000 K and higher were significantly less comfortable and less natural than conditions with lower CCTs. Conditions with lighting distributed in multiple zones in the patient room were viewed more favorably than a traditional overbed configuration. The participants in this simulated patient study reacted negatively to colored lighting on the footwall of the room but found a mixture of warmer and cooler luminaire CCTs acceptable. ","42":"This is a concluding part of an action research study to evaluate the impact on healthcare staff participation in the design of a new intensive care unit (ICU). Staff participated with multiple tools in the design; during the predesign phase utilizing co-design and virtual mock-ups, and also participating in the predesign evaluation (PDE) and postoccupancy evaluation (POE). Both the ICU design and evaluations were based on the principles of evidence-based design studies. Staff satisfaction was evaluated with an online survey comprising 116 statements on 13 different topics used both in PDE and POE. There was space for open-ended comments after each topic. There was a statistically significant difference (&lt;.001) between PDE and POE results. There were considerable improvements in privacy, accessibility, safety and security, and acoustics. It was assumed that participation in the predesign phase would positively influence POE results, but there were no statistical differences in any topics. However, as a result of collaborative predesign phase, the staff was satisfied with these jointly designed patient rooms. Open-ended questions revealed the importance to continue functional and technical support for staff after commissioning and ensure that technical solutions are practical and well-functioning. The use of PDE and POE assists to set predetermined criteria and evaluate the success of design. Healthcare providers should see POE as a valuable part of design and commissioning process. Additionally, the use of POE should be made more effortless and the results more easily accessible to promote increased interest and usage. ","43":"This study examined associations of objectively measured views of greenery in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) with changes in multiple psychological well-being measures among residents who were newly admitted to RACFs. Data were collected from 52 residents (mean age: 84, 73% women) of 13 RACFs, located in Melbourne, Australia. The outcomes were changes in depression, stress, anxiety, and quality of life (QoL) between baseline and 8-week follow-up. The exposure measures were the amount and presence of greenery visible from participant's bedroom and common areas (lounge, dining). Greenery was categorized as being either within or beyond the RACF perimeter. Regression analyses found that greenery visible from participant's bedroom was not associated with any outcomes. The amount of greenery visible from common areas within the RACF perimeter was adversely related to stress, unexpectedly: Each additional 1 m2 of greenery was associated with a greater increase in stress (b = 0.05; 95% CI [0.07, 0.94]). However, greenery visible from common areas beyond the perimeter contributed favorably to stress and QoL. The presence of such greenery was associated with a lower increase in stress (b = -3.99; 95% CI [-7.75, -0.23]; reference: no greenery), and a 1 m2 increment was associated with a greater increase in QoL (b = 0.07; 95% CI [0.02, 0.11]). Views of greenery outside of the RACF from lounge and dining areas may be protective against residents' stress increase and improve their QoL.

The Children's Memorial Health Center is the largest children's hospital in Poland. The hospital began operations in 1977 with a vision to be a modern healthcare facility that provides comprehensive care for children. That vision has not changed over time but everything else did. Six design thinking sessions were conducted with 83 employees and 40 respondents who used health services in the hospital in the past, along with in-depth interviews with 25 representatives of management to gather data for the hospital assessment. Sixty-three features influencing future development were identified. Seven groups of features were classified to be either transformation drivers (four groups) or enablers (three groups). We focused on features that were indicated by all groups of respondents to define a common vision for future development. Depending on the respondent's role in the healthcare ecosystem, the list of variables within each of seven groups defining the \"hospital of the future\" was different while evaluating the healthcare services. Therefore, all stakeholders must be engaged in the ideation process to create a strategy for a future care model driven by innovation.

The number of Veterans with dementia is growing rapidly, along with the associated debilitating behavior challenges. The severity of these distressed behaviors that predominantly occur at bath time often necessitates costly, dangerous sedatives. Feasibility studies of nonpharmacological behavioral interventions during bathing for people with dementia are urgently needed, and research supports MSE as a viable solution. Using an A-B, multiple baselines across participants design, this study tracked operational behaviors of four Veterans with dementia during bathing without and with an MSE intervention. Sessions were provided and recorded by a dedicated team of five nurses, so the study team could analyze the Veterans' operational behaviors to understand the impact of individualized MSE during both baseline and intervention phases. The results support the feasibility of MSE as a helpful, nonpharmacological behavioral intervention for Veterans with dementia during bathing. All participants experienced an overall increase in duration of positive operational behaviors and an overall decrease in duration of negative operational behaviors. Healthcare environments are integral components in dementia care and the use of MSE within the bathing setting appears to improve not only operational behaviors but the overall bathing experience. ","51":"The purpose of this study is to understand the nature and source of disruptions in an ambulance during the telemedicine-based caregiving process for stroke patients to enhance the ambulance design for supporting telemedicine-based care. Telemedicine is emerging as an efficient approach to provide timely remote assessment of patients experiencing acute stroke in an ambulance. These consults are facilitated by connecting the patient and paramedic with a remotely located neurologist and nurse using cameras, audio systems, and computers. However, ambulances are typically retrofitted to support telemedicine-enabled care, and the placement of these systems inside the ambulance might lead to spatial challenges and disruptions during patient evaluation. Video recordings of 13 simulated telemedicine-based stroke consults were coded and analyzed using an existing systems-based flow disruption (FD) taxonomy. For each observed disruption-the type, severity or impact, location in the ambulance, and equipment involved in the disruption were recorded. Seat size, arrangement of assessment equipment, location of telemedicine equipment (computer workstation), and design of telemedicine camera were among the factors that impacted telemedicine-related disruptions. The left ambulance seat zone and head of the patient bed were more involved in environmental hazard-related disruptions, while the right zone of the ambulance was more prone to interruptions and communication-related disruptions. Adequate evaluation space for the paramedic, proper placement of evaluation equipment, and telemedicine computer location could facilitate the stroke care evaluation process and reduce FDs in the ambulance. ","52":"The critical conditions of intensive care patients require providing them with a higher acuity of care. Thus, it is essential to focus on critical care nurses and improve their work environment in a way that maximizes productivity, collaboration, satisfaction, and leads to improved patient care. This study aims to explore the role the workplace layout design play in determining nurses' satisfaction in three intensive care units (ICUs) at a university hospital. A prospective, cross-sectional, single-center, survey-based design was employed in this study. Data were obtained, via a standardized questionnaire, from 36 morning shift nurses. The nurses' self-reported satisfaction scores in three different ICUs with differing overall layouts, nursing station locations, and workplace design were statistically compared. The study found that ICU 1 (private rooms, single corridor, central nursing station, close to supported services) had higher nursing satisfaction levels than ICUs 2 and 3 (open wards with separate service zones), F (2,34) = 5.054, p = .012. However, overall satisfaction was higher with the ICU 2 primary workspace design, possibly due to the perceived acoustic privacy in this configuration, F (2,34)= 4.492, p = .019. The ability of the ICU layout design to enhance teamwork and minimize traffic in patients care areas was found to be an important predictor of nurses' satisfaction. The primary workspace design capacity to minimize congestion and the presence of large numbers of providers in a confined workplace might account for variation in nurses' satisfaction. Physical environment variables in the ICU design may contribute to staff workplace satisfaction scores and may help in guiding informed choices regarding the future ICU design. ","53":"This case study intends to examine how staff characteristics, training methods, and duration of training impact overall staff preparedness and comfortability when transitioning to a new Labor and Delivery. A new medical facility offers an opportunity for greater capacity and expanding services, but it also poses new challenges for staff. Success in this transition depends on how quickly the staff can adapt to their new environment and how prepared they are to deliver high-quality care to patients. An optional survey was conducted to determine the staff's confidence in their training using a 5-point Likert-type scale. After responses were collected, a paired samples two-sided t test revealed that there was no statistically significant change in the confidence and preparedness for staff. With this overall outcome, medical facilities will have more discernment on ways to improve their employees' trust and confidence in performing their tasks and providing care while in a new environment. This will then be reflected in the care given toward patients in the future. ","54":"This study aims to demonstrate how multiphase postoccupancy evaluation (POE) research was integrated into multiple projects to develop a continuous learning cycle. Despite the well-recognized importance of POE, few studies have reported how knowledge from POE is applied in new designs. This study is developed as a multiphase POE that spanned 3 years and across three units. Phase I POE compared an existing unit (Unit A) in Hospital A and a new Unit B in Hospital B that has implemented innovative design features such as decentralized nurse stations. The idea was to understand the challenges of the existing facility in Hospital A and gather lessons learned from the new design in Unit B to inform the design of the Hospital A expansion (Unit C). After the new expansion was occupied, the Phase II POE was conducted using the same set of POE tools in both Unit C and Unit A. The POE applied the following methods: (1) patient room evaluations using the Center for Health Design standardized POE tools, (2) space syntax analysis of visibility, and (3) a pre- and postmove analysis of Press Ganey data. The results demonstrated that by incorporating lessons learned from the Phase I POE, Unit C has further improvement on patient room design ratings, improved patient satisfaction, and better visibility among nurse work areas compared to Unit A and Unit B. The multiphase, multisite POE with standardized tools has demonstrated its value as an important tool for continuous design quality improvement.

Early postoperative mobilization after surgery can effectively help prevent complications, but it is difficult to achieve in practice. An attentive empathetic design approach was used to gain insights into the users' functional needs, characteristics, contexts, as well as their emotional needs, behaviors, and psychology. The insights led to a design that leveraged psychological heuristics and habit-building principles to effect necessary mindset and behavioral changes of the stakeholders. Over four iterations, design ideas were prototyped, tested, and improved with participation of 30 patients and 30 nurses. Valuable insights were discovered. Most importantly, besides the medically critical need to avoid postoperative complications, the patients also had emotional needs for independence, confidence, and self-worthiness, while the nurses needed the patients' trust. Consequently, assistive bedside furniture prototypes were designed to enable the patients to move around safely by themselves. Feedback on the prototypes showed that the patients sat up more often, enjoyed doing more activities, became more confident and less fearful of moving around, and felt less burdening on the care providers. Moreover, the nurses appreciated that the prototypes reduced their patient-mobilization workload, facilitated patient empowerment, and improved their relationship with the patients. An attentive empathetic design approach can comprehend complex challenges of and subsequently design an effective solution for healthcare contexts, in which the stakeholders' medical necessities intertwine with emotional, psychological, behavioral, and sociocultural needs. ","57":"This article aims to describe users' perspectives about the impact of hospital outdoor spaces on the patient experience in a postacute setting. Hospital outdoor space is an important element in healthcare facility design. There is growing evidence that access to green space within hospital outdoor spaces facilitates healing. However, limited studies have explored the users' perspective regarding how hospital outdoor spaces impact the patient experience. As part of a hospital preoccupancy evaluation, users (patients, family, and staff) were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview to describe their experiences in the hospital's outdoor spaces. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Seventy-four individuals participated in this study: 24 inpatients, 15 outpatients, 11 family, 23 staff, and one volunteer. Three themes were identified: (1) outdoor space benefits healing by helping patients focus on life beyond their illness, (2) design of healthcare spaces facilitates patients' access to outdoor space to benefit healing, and (3) programming in the outdoor space promotes healing and recovery. This study describes the users' perspective regarding the value of outdoor spaces and the design elements that influence the patient experience. ","58":"Worldwide, children are increasingly being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The case of South Korea is not exceptional. One of the core symptoms of children with ASD is sensory reactivity issues, such as an unusual interest in the sensory aspects of the environment. One promising development in sensory enrichment for individuals with ASD is a multisensory environment (MSE). This study investigated the influence of MSE on the target behaviors of children with ASD with different sensory characteristics in the case of South Korea. A multiple treatment design {A-B-C-D (B + C) phases} was implemented to observe the six target behaviors of three children with ASD. The sensory environmental intervention focusing on visual and auditory stimuli was manipulated as a stimulating MSE or a relaxing MSE depending on the sensory profile of each participant. The analysis was undertaken using visual inspection with data patterns and graph slopes, which is a customary method of analyzing the single-subject design data. In addition, the means and standard deviations of the two target behaviors of each participant were analyzed together. The findings reveal that MSE interventions positively affected the target behaviors of children with ASD with diverse sensory characteristics. The stimulating MSE created by the integration of visual and auditory stimuli was the most effective intervention for the participants with hypo-visual and hypo-auditory sensitivities in this study. The MSE could be meaningful as a nonpharmaceutical therapy that could influence the daily behaviors of children with ASD.

This product was made to be used in hospitals and at homes. Mauritius is among the few countries, which has not had any cases of COVID-19 since for since May 2020 for a period of 150 days. It has opened its borders since October 2020, and since Mauritius being a small country, the spread of any type of virus can be imminent if not controlled properly. In case there is another spread of the COVID-19 in Mauritius, then the isolation pod could be used to keep infected people in quarantine. The aims of the study were to develop a prototype of an isolation cubicle that is collapsible and can be easily erected at homes or in hospitals, whenever the need arises. A prototype of the pod was made with metal bars welded together and tarpaulin materials were sewn together. A HEPA Fan Extractor was fitted inside the pod to allow the air to circulate. the tests carried out the pod could easily be assembled, transported and stored for further usage. From the volunteers' feedback, it was found that the pod was comfortable, spacious, and practical. The air monitoring tests carried on the carbon dioxide, temperature, and relative humidity were within the acceptable ranges.

Worldwide, hospital design is changing to mainly single-room accommodation. However, there is little literature exploring patients' and nurses' experiences of single-room designs. Scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance on scoping reviews. We conducted the search in medical databases for scientific and gray literature. The four authors independently used a data extraction tool to include sources from the searches. The sources were discussed during the process, and in case of a disagreement between two reviewers, the third and fourth reviewer would be invited to participate in the discussion until consensus was achieved. We included 22 sources published during the period 2002-2020, with a majority (n = 16) during the period 2013-2020. The sources were distributed on 10 different countries; however, England dominated with 14 publications. We found three main maps for reporting on patients' experiences: (1) personal control, (2) dignity, and (3) by myself. For the nurses' experiences, we found four main maps: (1) the working environment, (2) changes of nursing practice, (3) privacy and dignity, and (4) patient safety. We suggested that patients' and nurses' experiences are predominantly interdependent and that the implications of single-room accommodation is a large and complex issue which goes beyond hospital design. ","61":"Until the 1880s, hospitals excluded contagious disease patients from admission because of the danger they posed to other patients; by the 1950s, contagious disease care had literally moved into the general hospital. This article correlates the changing isolation facility designs with changing disease incidence and prevention strategies. It argues that isolation moved into the hospital in stages that have consequence for isolation facility design today. Between the 1890s and 1940s, contagious disease care shifted from remote isolation hospitals (commonly known as pest houses) to separate contagious disease hospitals, to contagious disease \"units\" adjacent to or within a general hospital facility, and to isolation rooms included in nursing units. The architectural history of isolation facility designs shows that the integration of isolation facilities into general hospitals relied on the success of new aseptic nursing procedures that prevented contact transmission but which downgraded the need for spatial separation to prevent airborne transmission. In the second half of the 20th century, federal funding and standards made isolation rooms in the hospital the norm. This migration coincided with a historically unprecedented reduction in contagious disease incidence produced by successful vaccines and antibiotics. By the 1980s, the rise of new and antibiotic resistant diseases led to extensive redesigns of the in-house isolation rooms to make them more effective. This article suggests that it is time to rethink isolation not just at the detail level but in terms of its location in relation to the general hospital.","62":"This study aims to gain insights into the implementation of theoretical knowledge on dementia-friendly design into practice to (1) identify key design criteria stimulating spatial orientation and wayfinding for seniors with dementia and (2) determine the optimal design for this purpose. Spatial orientation problems of seniors with dementia can be counteracted by the design of the physical environment of inpatient care facilities. Research has been conducted about design features supporting wayfinding skills for this target group, however, not on their implementation. Fourteen floor plans of the living group of built projects have been evaluated on 14 design criteria supporting wayfinding skills for the target group and measurable in floor plans by the performance of a comparative floorplan analysis and multicriteria assessment. Although one third of the evaluated design criteria are properly implemented, all floor plans of the selected projects had some gaps in fulfilling all design criteria. Five typological floor plans-based on the circulation systems of the cases-were distinguished: one straight corridor structured by two walls, one corridor with corners, two corridors separated from each other by the living room, a continuous loop corridor, and a corridor framed by a wall and interior elements (e.g., cabinets). The majority of the cases was based on a linear system with one straight corridor. Based on this study, three of the five discovered typological floor plans work well for stimulating wayfinding. Furthermore, special attention need to be given to the configuration of the floor plans, shape, and daylight in the corridor. ","63":"This article shares the results of a quantitative analysis of the space use and physical attributes of 140 acute care units (ACU) completed since 2007. To fill a gap in the literature with respect to the state of practice for ACU design over the study period by investigating relationships among the physical characteristics and density of completed ACUs. Robust industry interest about the topic-further agitated by the dearth of large-scale quantitative research regarding ACU space use-motivated completion of the study. Through extraordinary collaboration by participating firms, floor plans of 140 new ACUs from the study period were gathered, systematically measured, and then analyzed. Structural bay size, nurse station location, and the number of beds per unit were found to have significant relationships to ACU floor-gross area per bed. Additionally, nine significant associations among the explanatory variables were found, including moderate relationships among bay size, nurse station location, room handedness, and toilet room placement. The results suggest that project design teams tend to bundle key physical attributes together when planning ACUs. Moreover, density increases resulting from bay size reduction diminish as the bay size drops below 31'. Any impacts resulting from the major external events demarking the last decade were not sufficient to appreciably affect ACU density. Lastly, those concerned with increasing density and controlling ACU floor gross area are alerted to explore design options featuring bay sizes of approximately 30' in conjunction with a centralized nursing model containing more than 32 beds per unit. ","64":"The purpose of this study was to compare perceptions and behaviors of end users participating in simulations in a high-fidelity physical mock-up of an operating room (OR) prototype with the perceptions and behaviors of end users in the built out ORs postoccupancy. Simulation-based evaluations of high-fidelity physical mock-ups of proposed layouts are increasingly being conducted during the facility design process to understand impacts on workflow and potential adverse patient safety outcomes. Nevertheless, it is unclear to what extent user experiences in these simulated healthcare spaces are similar to those in built and occupied healthcare environments. Using interviews, surveys, and observations, this study compared user evaluations in a high-fidelity physical mock-up of an OR with user evaluations of the built and occupied OR postoccupancy. Workflow disruptions were also analyzed using video recordings for a simulated pediatric surgery and five pediatric surgeries in the actual OR. This study found that user perceptions and behavior in the two types of environments were mostly similar with regard to perceived support for the location of surgeon workstation, perceived space and task performance, perceived access to storage locations, boom setup, and OR cleanability. Participant's ratings differed for supportiveness of the mobile Circulating Nurse (CN) workstation, maneuvering booms, and environmental disruptions. Simulation-based evaluations are extremely beneficial during the design process and can provide valuable input to design teams as well as clinical teams about workflow and safety issues that allow design issues to be addressed before construction. ","65":"A predominant notion among researchers is that hospital room design and decor are subject to the designer's expression of self, which is contrary to evidence-based studies showing that design and decor can impact patient health. The aim of this study was to examine whether improvement in quality of healthcare provided in hospitals could be achieved through the convergence of expertise of healthcare professionals and hospital room designers. This was a prospective study to identify the impact of hospital interior design features with a focus on single occupancy rooms. Volunteers were recruited through advertisements and the study was conducted at the Tripoli Medical Center. Responses were analyzed using a three-dimensional computer-aided design software to help respondents accurately map their preferences and visualize outcomes. Participants preferred an aesthetically pleasing hospital room environment that included art and bright colors, window views, and the need for personalization, technology, mobility, and flexibility, all of which improved satisfaction and happiness. Of these, participants' preference for technology as a cause for satisfaction and happiness was a novel finding. Designers of hospital room interiors should plan and create an appealing single occupancy room for increasing user satisfaction and patient wellness.

Furthermore, changes and modifications are continuously taking place in hospitals, with no consideration to the important role those changes might play in reducing or encouraging WPV behaviors. This research serves as an initial step in offering answers on how the environmental design of an ED can be modified and manipulated to prevent and control WPV. Accordingly, the objective of this research is to identify the environmental features that potentially influence WPV in the ED. This could provide healthcare designers with the necessary tools to forecast the location of WPV and define the measures needed for a safer working environment. The study comprised a hybrid method approach that evaluates the implementation of crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) through field observation and combined with space syntax analyses (SSAs) of the spatial attributes. The results showed a positive relationship between the spatial properties (high integration and connectivity values) and WPV locations. The results also demonstrated that situational factors as natural surveillance played an important role in displacing the WPV locations. The contribution of this research lies in elaborating the SSA and CPTED from a conceptual to an empirical level. Combining those tools will help identify the location of WPV in the ED and hence facilitates successful future environmental intervention strategies.

To date, there is no valid instrument in the German-speaking countries with which the quality of the physical environment in residential long-term care facilities can be systematically assessed. To report the translation, linguistic validation, cultural adaptation, and content validity evaluation of the Australian Environmental Audit Tool-High Care in preparation for use in German nursing homes. The procedure was guided by an adapted multistep process of the World Health Organization (1998) and included focus groups involving potential users of the new tool such as scientific experts and healthcare professionals (n = 40). Content validity indices were calculated following a two-step expert survey. The final draft versions of the German Environmental Audit Tool (G-EAT) included 74 and 77 items, for non-secured units and secure units, respectively, divided into 10 key design principles according to the Australian original. The evaluation of content validity showed that cultural differences existed in several items. The G-EAT provides the means for conducting a valid assessment of the environmental quality of people with dementia in German nursing homes.

The study replicates Ghamari and Pati's 2018 study to identify the environmental attributes that attract eye fixation during wayfinding by objectively tracking eye movements and fixation as healthy subjects navigate through a complex, unfamiliar indoor healthcare setting. The study addressed what do people look at while navigating in unfamiliar healthcare environments? What are the relative time periods of eye fixations on different visual environmental elements of the healthcare-designed environments? And what role do visual environmental attributes in healthcare facilities, such as configuration, color, art, directories, maps, furniture, and so on, play during the wayfinding process. Twenty-four adults in different genders and various age groups participated in this study and navigated five routes with different degrees of difficulty. The sequence of the destinations in this study was randomized. The data were collected by tracking gaze fixations while human subjects navigated an indoor complex healthcare environment. The findings show that identifying signs (29.1%), informative signs (20.8%), and architectural features (11.3%) constituted the most frequent elements attracting gaze, substantially more than the other classes of information. Four types of signage (identifying signs, informative signs, directional, and safety\/regulatory signs) were accounted for 62.3% of the total gaze fixation time. The comparison of the ordered list based on frequencies and time of eye fixations on various elements developed in Ghamari and Pati's study shows a vast degree of similarities.

However, consumers' experiences of using health tools and their ideas for improving them are not known. Multicenter study was set in hospital waiting areas of outpatient rehabilitation services. Semistructured in-person interviews were conducted with 33 adult consumers attending appointments for various health conditions. Seven stages of the Framework Method were used to analyze data. Six themes were identified which explained barriers and enablers from the perspective of consumers. The barriers were accessibility issues; personal factors-physical condition, emotional state, and preferences; and poorly presented and outdated resources. The enablers were design suits consumer needs and preferences; usable in available time or portable; and compatible environment for engaging and sharing. Consumers shared design ideas which fit within four typologies. A range of barriers and enablers exist which have an impact on consumers' ability to engage with available health information, resources, and supports in hospital outpatient waiting areas. Practical insights from the perspective of consumers can be applied to future health service design.

People with a life-limiting illness may receive palliative care to improve their quality of life in hospital and may have multiple admissions as their illness progresses. Yet, despite a preference for a death at home, more than half of the dying population will receive end-of-life care in hospital. The physical hospital environment consists of ambiance, aesthetics, and architectural factors, and it is well known that the hospital's acute wards are not a homely environment. Demand is increasing for the physical environment to be improved to better meet the needs and demands of palliative and end-of-life patients and their families. Combining thematic analysis and meta-ethnography methodologies, 12 international qualitative papers were analyzed and synthesized by the three authors. Findings resulted in the development of the SSAFeR Place approach that incorporates the concepts that are important to palliative and end-of-life patients and their families by describing an environment within the acute or palliative care units that feels safe, is private, customizable, and accommodates family; is a space to share with others, is homelike in ambiance and aesthetics, and is conducive for reflection. The concepts of identity, belonging, and safety are connected to the notions of home. To provide person-centered care and to move the focus toward the palliative approach of comfort and quality of life, attention to room size, layout, aesthetics, and ambiance is needed.

The intensive care unit (ICU) patient room is a highly complex patient care environment where the design of the room must support patient care delivery safely and efficiently. There is a lack of research examining how ICU design elements interact with other system components to impact patient care. An observational case study method utilizing a systems approach was used to observe and graphically depict clinical challenges with mirrored room configurations and to identify potential solutions. Video recordings of the three clinical scenarios were analyzed in detail in conjunction with three rounds of interviews with a clinical expert. Equipment or task characteristics that require orienting to a specific side of a patient create challenges in a mirrored room. In order to deliver care safely and efficiently in the mirrored room, adaptations would be required including changing boom, equipment and team member locations, purchasing new equipment, staff training, and inventory management. Some procedures such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation would be difficult to conduct safely in the mirrored room, even with significant adaptations. Solutions to the challenges presented in mirrored room configurations are multifaceted and require simultaneous and ongoing changes to multiple systems elements, while others can be addressed relatively easily, for example, purchasing new equipment.

Positive psychological feelings are the hidden powerful treatment in hospitals. Although that Jordan represents a third-world country, it is counted as one of the most sought-after healthcare locations in the Middle East for its distinguished healthcare serveries (Private Hospitals Association, 2019). Nevertheless, the architectural and interior design of the healthcare facilities in Jordan usually ignores the inpatients' psychological needs. Also, there is an absence of practicing a set of psychological supportive design features to guide the hospitals' design in Jordan. Design features are obtained from the main theories in the field of supportive healing environments. A large Jordanian public hospital was selected to be assessed in terms of these features within the developed practical framework. This study adopts a mixed methodology; data are collected using different methods, mainly literature review, site inventory, and inpatients' questionnaire. The studied hospital remains moderately considerable in terms of the psychologically supportive design features. However, the nature connectivity aspect is not satisfactorily considered in the studied hospital design. This study suggests a responsive design that fosters interaction and integration with surrounding nature in order to increase levels of connectivity with nature.

In international literature, there are few studies concerning the application of POEs to hospice, assessing the impact of individual environmental factors on users' psychoemotional reactions. The set of elements that patients and their families perceive as important, defining the architectural quality of a hospice, has not been sufficiently investigated yet. Therefore, a POE was performed on a sample of hospice in Italy, by preparing a self-filled questionnaire addressing patients and relatives. Indicators of perceived physical-spatial humanization, which were validated for hospital facilities (perceived hospital environment quality indicators), were used for the assessment then implemented and harmonized in relation to hospice facilities features. The study revealed the indicators of architectural quality most valued by users, whose reliability was then verified, along with their average quality, by highlighting recurring shortcomings. The global quality was found to be generally high. Below-average scores were found for indicators on usability, acoustic comfort of outdoors, visual and acoustic comfort of shared indoor spaces, and artificial lighting in the recovery room. The study generated new knowledge on hospice and confirmed the efficacy of POEs as a tool both for purchasers and designers.

Ambulatory oncology practices face unique challenges in delivering safe care. With increasing patient volumes, these settings require additional attention to support patient safety and efficient clinical work processes. This study used a mixed methods design with sequential data collection. Eight ambulatory oncology practices (of 29 participating practices) participated in both the quantitative and qualitative phases. In surveys, clinicians (n = 56) reported on safety organizing and communication satisfaction measures. Qualitative data included observations and semistructured interviews (n = 46) with insight into how physical layout influenced care delivery. Quantitative analysis of survey data included descriptive and correlational statistics. Qualitative analysis used inductive and thematic content analysis. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated using side-by-side comparison tables for thematic analysis. Safety organizing performance was positively correlated with clinician communication satisfaction, r(54 df) = .414, p = .002. Qualitative analyses affirmed that the physical layout affected communication around chemotherapy infusion and ultimately patient safety. After data integration, safety organizing and clinician communication were represented by two themes: visibility of patients during infusion and the proximity of clinicians in the infusion center to clinicians in the clinic where providers see patients. Physical layouts of ambulatory oncology practices are an important factor to promote patient safety.

Due to increasing ED visits annually, an efficient work environment has become one of the main concerns in designing EDs. According to the literature, an efficient work environment and teamwork improve healthcare outcomes and positively impact staff satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, EDs faced various changes such as workflow and space usage. Few studies explored staff perceptions about the influence of design features on efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. An online survey with 14 open- and closed-ended questions was distributed among ED staff members to collect data about unit design features that impact efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. The central nursing station was one of the preferred configurations that increased efficiency and teamwork in EDs. Decentralizing disposal rooms in small-size EDs and decentralizing the medication room in large-size EDs with more than 65 exam rooms can decrease staff walking steps. Flexibility to expand treatment spaces on demand, one-way track circulation path, and changing the air pressure in COVID-19 treatment areas were some of the staff suggestions for future EDs. The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge that EDs' physical environments can impact efficiency and teamwork among staff and, consequently, healthcare outcomes. Compartmentalization of the ED layout can reduce the spread of COVID-19. ","83":"The aim of this research was to obtain user perspectives of adolescent patients to inform the redesign of an adolescent mental health inpatient facility ward unit in regional Australia. It is well established that the consumer will use and understand unit space differently than the health professional, because of their unique positioning and depth of experience. The participation of young people in the design of ward environments and programs is essential. A combination of focus groups and interviews was undertaken with eight participants. This study found that, in its current form, the unit revolves around routines, tasks, and patient safety, which in turn are driven by secure spaces and surveillance of the patients. Due to these routines and tasks, the aspects of individualized patient care and personal impetus and comfort are lost. Adolescent patients are able to identify solutions to enhance their hospital stay in the mental health context without being excessive and unrealistic in their suggestions. When designing an adolescent unit, there needs to be some consideration as to how the group using the unit understands space. Through their role and depth of hospital experience, the adolescent patient will use and understand unit space differently from that of the health professional whose role is a worker. Therefore, it is necessary to gain the perspectives of adolescent patients for efficient and effective functioning of such an environment and to suit the needs of those it is \"built for,\" the adolescent patient. ","84":"This article documents the development and implementation of a new approach for health facilities construction and maintenance planning, the use of a Facilities and Clinical Coordination (FCC) Council, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). WRNMMC is preparing for the largest and most complex renovation project in recent Department of Defense history. There is sparse documentation demonstrating stepwise frameworks for the implementation of effective and efficient health facilities maintenance management tools and techniques. This study discusses the development and evaluation of the FCC Council. Clarity to the literature sources guiding the development of the FCC Council is provided, followed by the survey approach undertaken to assess Council efficacy based on participants' perceptions. Data are analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Our study suggests routine cross-functional synchronous FCC Council meetings improve perceptions of safety and communication, encourage teamwork, and are more productive when conducted using synchronous rather than asynchronous communication. Clinician participants strongly supported the face-to-face meeting approach and considered such meetings more effective as they are perceived to maintain staff and patient safety as a constant organizational focus. The FCC's perceived effectiveness toward improving healthcare facilities maintenance planning centers on engaged leadership, the inclusion of diverse subject matter experts, and structured group facilitation. Our results inform health facilities planners of the value the FCC Council brings to an organization by helping to develop organizational buy-in for major facilities renovation projects. ","85":"This study aims to delineate if and how healthy volunteers admitted to simulated care can aid in understanding real well-being experiences of in-hospital surgical patients. Scientific research is necessary to understand the mediating effect of healthcare design on patient outcomes. Studies with patients are, however, difficult to conduct as they require substantial funding, time, and research capacity, and recovering patients are often not willing or able to participate. If studies conducted with volunteers provide similar findings, such studies might serve as fruitful alternatives for future research. A multimethod study was conducted between July 2017 and December 2017 with 17 volunteers who underwent a 24-hr simulated inpatient postsurgical care protocol. Data on value experiences, norms, and design requirements for an optimal healing environment were collected via diaries and semi-structured value-oriented interviews, focused on the values of spatial comfort, privacy, autonomy, sensory comfort, safety and security, and social comfort. Volunteers' outcomes were compared to prior literature on similar patients' outcomes. Volunteers seem to experience their healing environment similarly to patients with regard to the values of spatial comfort, privacy, autonomy, sensory comfort, and social comfort related to contact with personnel and relatives. Less valuable insights were gained on the values of safety and security, and social comfort related to interaction with other patients, most probably due to the study design and because the participants did not truly experience a diseased bodily state. Simulated hospital admissions with volunteers provide a satisfactory alternative for studying real patient outcomes. ","86":"This case study examines the implementation of inpatient telemedicine in COVID-19 intensive care units (ICUs) and explores the impact of shifting forms of visibility on the management of the unit, staff collaboration, and patient care. The COVID-19 crisis drove healthcare institutions to rapidly develop new models of care based on integrating digital technologies for remote care with transformations in the hospital-built environment. The Sheba Medical Center in Israel created COVID-19 ICUs in an underground structure with an open-ward layout and telemedicine control rooms to remotely supervise, communicate, and support the operations in the contaminated zones. One unit had a physical visual connection between the control room and the contaminated zone through a window, while the other had only a virtual connection with digital technologies. The findings are based on semistructured interviews with Sheba medical staff, telemedicine companies, and the architectural design team and observations at the COVID-19 units during March-August 2020. The case study illustrates the implications of virtual and physical visibility on the management of the unit, staff collaboration, and patient care. It demonstrates the correlations between patterns of visibility and the users' sense of control, orientation in space, teamwork, safety, quality of care, and well-being. The case study demonstrates the limitations of current telemedicine technologies that were not designed for inpatient care to account for the spatial perception of the unit and the dynamic use of the space. It presents the potential of a hybrid model that balances virtual and physical forms of visibility and suggests directions for future research and development of inpatient telemedicine. ","87":"The study examines the integration of the Evidence-based Design (EBD) approach in healthcare architecture education in the context of an academic design studio. Previous research addressed the gap between scientific research and architectural practice and the lack of research on the use of the EBD approach in architectural education. The research examines an undergraduate architectural studio to design a Maggie's Centre for cancer care in Israel and evaluates the impact of the EBD approach on the design process and design outcomes. The research investigates the impact of the integration of three predesign tasks: (1) literature review of healing architecture research, (2) analysis and comparison of existing Maggie's Centres, and (3) analysis of the context of the design project. The literature review of scientific research supported the conceptual design and development of the projects. The analysis of existing Maggie's centers, which demonstrated the interpretation of the evidence by different architects, developed the students' ability to evaluate EBD in practice critically, and the study of the projects' local context led the students to define the relevance of the evidence to support their vision for the project. The research demonstrates the advantages of practicing EBD at an early stage in healthcare architectural education to enhance awareness of the impact of architectural design on the users' health and well-being and the potential to support creativity and innovative design. More studies in design studios are needed to assess the full impact of integrating EBD in architectural education. ","88":"The objective of this study is to identify an architectural design framework that can be applied to create adaptable, transformative therapy rooms that benefit children with autism and their therapists. Previous research suggests that environment shapes and influences human behavior. However, there remains a lack of evidence of effective design for pediatric rehabilitation therapy rooms. This study specifically focuses on how the design of the therapy room influences the patient's level of comfort and participation as well as the therapists' quality and efficiency of treatment to improve the overall therapeutic experience. Two different surveys were conducted to improve the design of a therapeutic room based on professional therapist experiences. A grounded theory approach was employed to identify specific codes and categories. The result of this study is an architectural framework based on specific design tenets and their properties that not only can be utilized by architects and interior designers for building a new therapy center but could also be used for remodeling existing therapy rooms. ","89":"The aims of this study are to establish an evaluation system and find the existing problems in the architectural design of township hospitals in the severely cold regions of China. Due to the geographical location and economic factors, development still has some key problems, such as inadequate construction, old facilities, and backward technology, which are more prominent in the severely cold regions. First, evaluation factors have been selected and determined by literature review and on-site investigation. Evaluation rules have been determined using fuzzy membership function. Then, the analytic hierarchy process is used to determine the weights of the evaluation factors at all levels. Finally, take a township hospital as an example to calculate the comprehensive evaluation results. A comprehensive evaluation index system with 28 elements and 76 factors for the township hospitals in severely cold regions including the basic health service capacity, the emergency capacity, and the climate fitness. The establishment of the comprehensive evaluation system of township hospitals in severely cold areas in this study aims to find out the problems through the evaluation of the existing township hospitals in the severely cold areas and provide guidance for the transformation of existing township hospitals in the severely cold areas. By comparing the scheme evaluation for building hospitals, we shall look for the optimal solution to provide reference for future development in the construction of township hospitals. ","90":"This project used historical hospital data to forecast demand for specialized bariatric beds. Models were evaluated that determined the relationship between the number of bariatric beds owned and service level for patients of size requiring these beds. A calculator was developed for minimizing the equipment costs of meeting demand. Failing to provide enough bariatric beds may negatively affect outcomes for patients of size and healthcare workers, whereas owning more bariatric beds than required to meet demand means unnecessary cost. With rising rates of obesity increasing care costs, minimizing equipment costs is increasingly important. One year of hospital admissions data were used to determine arrival rates and lengths of stay for patients of size. Two subsequent years verified the consistency of these rates. Simulations modeled the flow of patients of size through the hospital and the service level associated with the number of beds owned. A minimization function determined the optimal number of bariatric beds to be provided. A simplified, generalizable model was compared to the simulation. The simplified model produced similar results to more complex simulation. The optimization was robust, or insensitive to small changes in inputs, and identified substantial opportunity for savings if demand for beds was substantially over- or underestimated. The simplified model and cost optimization could be used in many situations to prevent costly errors in equipment planning. However, hospitals should consider customized simulation to estimate demand for high-cost equipment or unique circumstances not fitting the assumptions of these models. ","91":"The intensive care environment in hospitals has been the subject of significant empirical and qualitative research in the 2005-2020 period. Particular attention has been devoted to the role of infection control, family engagement, staff performance, and the built environment ramifications of the recent COVID-19 global pandemic. A comprehensive review of this literature is reported summarizing recent advancements in this rapidly expanding body of knowledge. This comprehensive review conceptually structures the recent medical intensive care literature to provide conceptual clarity and identify current priorities and future evidence-based research and design priorities. Each source reviewed was classified as one of the five types-opinion pieces\/essays, cross-sectional empirical investigations, nonrandomized comparative investigations, randomized studies, and policy review essays-and into nine content categories: nature engagement and outdoor views; family accommodations; intensive care unit (ICU), neonatal ICU, and pediatric ICU spatial configuration and amenity; noise considerations; artificial and natural lighting; patient safety and infection control; portable critical care field hospitals and disaster mitigation facilities including COVID-19; ecological sustainability; and recent planning and design trends and prognostications. Among the findings embodied in the 135 literature sources reviewed, single-bed ICU rooms have increasingly become the norm; family engagement in the ICU experience has increased; acknowledgment of the therapeutic role of staff amenities; exposure to nature, view, and natural daylight has increased; the importance of ecological sustainability; and pandemic concerns have increased significantly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Discussion of the results of this comprehensive review includes topics noticeably overlooked or underinvestigated in the 2005-2020 period and priorities for future research. ","92":"We investigated apartment designs in apartment blocks built 1990-2015 in Gothenburg, Sweden. We investigated the residents' attitudes toward their previous, present, and future housing and their perceived possibilities for aging-in-place. We analyzed their apartments, focusing on the possibilities for aging-in-place in future care situations concerning bedroom capacity in a care situation; spatial proximity between bathroom, bedroom, storage, and entrance; and functional autonomy in a care situation without too much disturbance for a partner. Since the 2000s, the ambition in Sweden is to enable older people to remain in ordinary housing. The possibilities for aging-in-place should therefore be considered already in the design stage, also when producing standard apartments. Semi-structured interviews were made with 30 households, with one or more resident 65 years or older. Floor plan analyses were made of their present apartments. The majority displayed a pragmatic attitude toward aging, high satisfaction with their present housing situation, and good chances for aging-in-place in future homecare scenarios. The floor plan analysis shows that the three concepts of bedroom capacity, spatial proximity, and functional autonomy can be used to determine the potential for aging-in-place. The results suggest that architectural qualities related to aging-in-place are not automatically connected to floor size or number of rooms. Small apartments can perform better than larger ones, depending on spatio-functional organization and connections between different functions. The residents' perceived chances for aging-in-place confirm this relation. Future studies should compare different locations, production periods, and relations between size, space efficiency, and accessibility. ","93":"","94":"We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health outcomes using a five-step guide. Social network analysis (SNA) is common in social science fields and has more recently been used to study health-related topics including obesity, violence, substance use, health organizational behavior, and healthcare utilization. SNA, alone or in conjunction with spatial analysis, can be used to uniquely evaluate the impact of the physical or built environment on health. The environment can shape the presence, quality, and function of social relationships with spatial and network processes interacting to affect health outcomes. While there are some common measures frequently used in modeling the impact of social networks on health outcomes, there is no standard approach to social network modeling in health research, which impacts rigor and reproducibility. We provide an overview of social network concepts and terminology focused on egocentric network data. Egocentric, or personal networks, take the perspective of an individual who identifies their own connections (alters) and also the relationships between alters. We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health outcomes according to the following five-step guide: (1) model selection, (2) social network exposure variable and selection considerations, (3) covariate selection related to sociodemographic and health characteristics, (4) covariate selection related to social network characteristics, and (5) analytic considerations. We also present an example of SNA. SNA provides a powerful repertoire of techniques to examine how relationships impact attitudes, experiences, and behaviors-and subsequently health. ","95":"To verify the effectiveness of our infection control measures based on the infection control risk assessment (ICRA) to minimize the risk of Aspergillus dispersion before, during, and after demolition work in a university hospital. It is widely accepted that invasive aspergillosis is associated with construction, renovation, and demolition activities within or close to hospital sites. However, the risk is underestimated, and only limited preventive measures are taken in Japanese hospitals. The demolition process, carried out in July 2014, was supervised by our facility management in collaboration with the infection prevention team and followed an adapted ICRA tool. Dust containment measures were implemented to reduce the risk of airborne Aspergillus contamination. Air sampling was performed at four wards in the adjacent hospital buildings to assess the containment measures' effectiveness. A high, undetermined number of colonies of bacteria and molds were detected on all outside balconies before demolition. During demolition, Aspergillus spp. was detected only in the ward closest to the demolition site. However, no case of aspergillosis was reported. The difference-in-difference analysis revealed that the interaction between the demolition activity, height of the ward, and distance of the air intake to the demolition activities resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of Aspergillus spp. When large-scale demolition work occurs in hospital premises, Aspergillus spp. may increase in the ward where the vertical and horizontal distance of air intake from the demolition site is close, even though infection control measures based on the ICRA are implemented. ","96":"During the last several decades, researchers have produced abundant evidence of the environmental impacts on stress, attention, and physical activity. More recently, scholars have turned their focus to the influence environments have on mental wellness. Therefore, a critical review of this more recent research is both timely and crucial for setting the future research agenda. In this article, we examined 65 papers published between 2008 and 2019 that examined the environmental correlates of a wide variety of mental health outcomes. We coded each study by type of environment, research design, mental health measurement scale used, and p-value. We categorized the research studies into six groups based on mental health outcomes: emotions, moods, vitality, executive function, stress, and general well-being. Our review revealed several trends among the studies, including a heavy focus on nature and outdoor environments with little attention to workplace or residential environments; a lack of consensus on how to operationalize the environment; a heavy reliance on self-reported ratings using a wide variety of scales, many focused on the same outcome; and a disproportionate focus on short-term health effects. There is a need for greater consensus on research constructs and health outcome measurements, focused on a wider variety of environmental settings and scales, in order to better inform evidence-based environmental design practice. ","97":"","98":"To assess hypothesized effects of decentralized nursing models on adult inpatient outcomes, patient medical records and satisfaction surveys were analyzed from two rural community hospitals that transitioned from centralized to decentralized nursing unit designs in 2015. The objective to place nurses closer to patients precipitates broad use of decentralized nursing unit designs over models with centralized nurse stations. Decentralized models have been hypothesized to improve patient outcomes, but few studies have empirically measured effects. A cross-sectional, pre-post study used regression and interrupted time series models of adult inpatient data. Encounter-level patient records and survey responses across both sites were analyzed for a change in length of stay (LOS) and patient satisfaction from the preperiod (centralized) to the postperiod (decentralized). LOS decreased in the postperiod compared to the preperiod at one site, and there was no change in LOS at the other. Patient satisfaction mostly improved at both hospitals in the decentralized model; however, most upward trends started prior to the move, with no change postmove. Patient satisfaction significantly improved regarding quietness at night and overall hospital rating at one hospital and decreased regarding receiving help as soon as wanted at the other hospital. These changes occurred at the time of the move but may not be solely attributable to the decentralized nursing model. Overall, the results were mixed. One hospital experienced positive changes while the other did not, suggesting factors apart from nursing unit design are important to assess. ","99":"This article aims to make clearer, with supporting evidence, the clinical benefits of the nature-based rehabilitation program (NBRP) and the restorative values of visiting botanical garden for people with stress-related mental disorders. Throughout the years, nature-based therapy has been acknowledged as a valuable rehabilitation practice that integrates specially designed natural environments and nature-related activities for people with mental health conditions. The comparative analyses of parallel conducted the NBRP at botanical garden and occupational therapy realised at the Day Hospital of the Institute of Mental Health in Belgrade included 27 participants divided into two groups. The data collection employed a mixed method combining a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale and on-site observations. The positive findings on the psychological recovery of the participants seem to be related to NBRP. The restorative potential of the garden was recognized through the observed interaction between participants and the natural entities employed through the various themed activities. The observed landscape elements especially solitary plant specimens or tall and single-form trees within the garden can be embraced as design guidelines for the development of an evidence-based practice that can support the recovery process of people with mental health conditions. Our findings endorse that ongoing social development and progressive urbanization have broadened the interest in scientific research involving nature-based solutions that help preserve the physical and mental health of people in low- and middle-income Western Balkan countries with a high prevalence of mental disorders in the urban environment that relates to social inequalities and natural disasters. ","100":"The purpose of this study was to translate the Environmental Assessment Tool-Higher Care (EAT-HC) into Japanese and validate its use in small-scale group living facilities in Japan. Environment of a facility is shown to improve its residents' quality of life (QOL). Japan's \"welfare-based nursing homes for the elderly\" are gradually shifting to a small-scale group living concept called group care units (GCUs). However, there is no appropriate environmental tool available for evaluating GCUs. The application of valid environmental assessment tools brings about a better understanding of the nature of good environments and the relationship between environments and outcomes for residents living with dementia. The study had a mixed method design conducted in several steps, covering translation and adaptation. The translation phase involved (1) forward translation and (2) backward translation. The adaptation phase involved (3) content validity and homogeneity reliability and (4) concurrent validity and interrater reliability. 71 Items (92%) met the acceptable level of content validity (item-content validity index [CVI] &gt; .79) and had good scale-CVI of .88. Concurrent validity was confirmed between .65 and .78 (p &lt; .001). For reliability test, the internal consistency of six subscales was between .88 and .98. Overall interobserver agreement was 90.3%. Intraclass correlation coefficients were .80-.98 (p &lt; .001), and homogeneity reliability coefficient for all items was &gt;.76 (p &lt; .01). Validation of the EAT-HC-Japanese Version (EAT-HC-JV) was confirmed as an appropriate tool for environmental assessment to enhance the QOL in Japan's GCUs. For future study, we plan to modify the EAT-HC-JV to adapt to Japanese cultural aspects in order to increase its usability in Japan. ","101":"This study fills the gap in literature by examining the design elements preferred in psychotherapy waiting rooms. Studies have examined waiting rooms in hospitals and doctors' offices, but there is little published literature on waiting rooms in psychotherapy offices. Waiting rooms in psychotherapy offices may affect clients' perceived quality of care and their comfort level. Psychotherapists in Connecticut and Rhode Island were interviewed and agreed to have the waiting rooms (20 in total) of their practices photographed. Then, in a within-subjects design, 250 participants (225 retained for analyses) from MTurk answered questions about the quality of care and comfort in the environment expected in those 20 waiting rooms. Factor analytic results showed that waiting rooms that were welcoming and comfortable as well as large and spacious rated higher for the quality of care and comfort in the environment anticipated by the participant; those that were cramped and crowded rated lower. Few therapists reported any design education about counseling environments and none about the waiting room. Information from this study can guide the design of psychotherapy waiting rooms and enhance healthcare experience. ","102":"Exposure to nature has been shown to influence various dimensions of human experience in the healthcare environment. This mixed method study explores the effects of the presence of biophilic, nature-based imagery on patient perceptions of their hospital room and aspects of their experience in rehabilitation. In settings where patients have high degrees of medical acuity and infection control is a major concern, exposure to the benefits of real nature may be precluded. This is also true in many older healthcare facilities which were not designed with salutatory nature exposure in mind. In these settings, the presence of nature imagery may provide benefits which positively impact patient experience. Seventy-six physical rehabilitation patients on a medically complex\/cardiopulmonary rehabilitation unit filled out questionnaires assessing their perceptions of their room and various indexes of patient satisfaction. Data were collected from 47 patients in enhanced room containing nature imagery and 29 patients in standard rooms which served as controls. Scores on the Environmental Assessment Scale (EAS) indicated a significant difference between experimental and control group in the rating of their rooms (p = .0071). Ratings of quality of room, quality of stay, quality of sleep, and overall care trended in the direction of the hypothesis but were not significant. Data from qualitative questionnaires supported the results of the EAS. We conclude that the presence of biophilic nature imagery in the hospital rooms had a significant effect on patients' room ratings and positively influenced indexes of patient satisfaction.

Visual arts, particularly painting, have historically played an important role in the design and atmosphere of healthcare spaces, especially hospitals. From 2000 to 2019, 79 publications located in relevant databases and manual searches were identified and analyzed. Sixty of these publications include empirical studies and 19 theoretical models, comments, or reflections on the use of art in children's hospitals. Their analysis allows us to differentiate four groups of works: (a) \"environmental\" includes works whose purpose is to know how visual artistic interventions in the hospital can affect the people who see them, mainly pediatric patients, families, and health workers; (b) \"participatory\" includes studies aimed at knowing the effect of developing visual arts activities in the hospital; (c) \"exploratory\" includes works whose purpose was to know more about the children's perspective using their artistic expressions; and (d) \"diagnostic\" includes those that use children's drawings as a tool to diagnose diverse processes related to the pediatric patients' experience. Taken together, the works we analyzed in our study support the use of visual arts in hospitals as a resource to enhance the well-being of children and families and their experience in the hospital.

Additionally, physicians participating in the handoffs responded to a survey pertaining to their perception of interruptions and collaboration with clinicians during each phase. Other organizational and demographic data were obtained from the hospital database, surveys, and observations. Physicians working in the open workstation experienced a significantly higher number of interruptions\/hour (18.08 int\/hr) as compared to the semi-open (13.62 int\/hr) and enclosed workstations (11.41 int\/hr). Most physicians perceived that they were interrupted in the semi-open and open workstations. In addition, majority of physicians in the enclosed pod perceived high collaboration with clinicians involved in and present in the workstation during handoff.

Design thinking is a collaborative method of inquiry that fosters innovative, team-generated solutions to complex scenarios, known as \"wicked problems,\" that are extraordinarily difficult to solve. It is a practical tool in the toolbox of the codesign team, which includes the client and design professionals as primary stakeholders. It is powered by team-based creativity that adaptively responds to a need for new approaches and products in an innovative and practically applicable way. The need for design thinking in healthcare is steadily increasing as the healthcare system and its care environments continue to grow in complexity. Although major medical breakthroughs have undeniably expanded the average human life span, the current healthcare system is inefficient. Now, more than ever, design thinking and the innovative, human-centered solutions it enables are needed within healthcare design. Although the use of design thinking as a method within the field of architecture is not new, many design teams struggle integrating it fully within the design process, particularly in healthcare. The knowledge, design method, checklists, and direction provided in this article can benefit healthcare design teams to successfully integrate the method into practice. If design thinking is integrated into the healthcare architectural design process with the creative problem-solving method, opportunities will arise for innovative solutions and deeper insights into problems to benefit healthcare delivery.

Few studies to date have explored wayfinding in the Emergency Department (ED). Yet, as ED usage continues to grow, effective wayfinding in these high-stress, fast-paced environments is likely to become increasingly important. At an adult ED located in the U.S. Southeast, wayfinding has been a persistent problem. We subsequently developed a two-part wayfinding intervention: colored routes to key destinations in the ED and corresponding visitor badges. Quality criteria were formulated using the Donabedian model: visibility (structure), usability (process), efficiency (process), and overall effectiveness (outcome). Assessments consisted of staff surveys, which were distributed from March to early April 2019. The strong ratings across quality criteria, added to affirmative comments from staff, provide evidence that the color coding system made a positive impact on wayfinding. While the results should be generalized with caution, the two-part intervention may be highly portable to other contexts. Future studies might examine the effect of colored routes alone. They might illuminate relations between structure, process, and outcomes as they relate to the assessment of wayfinding. They might also expand wayfinding quality criteria. Ultimately, such studies should improve not only the productivity but also the accessibility and user experience of the ED.

Systems-focused simulation, underpinned by human factors science, is increasingly being used as a quality improvement tool to test and evaluate healthcare spaces with the stakeholders that use them. Purposeful real-to-life simulated events are rehearsed to allow healthcare teams opportunity to identify what is working well and what needs improvement within the work system such as tasks, environments, and processes that support the delivery of healthcare services. This project highlights salient evaluation objectives and methods used within the clinical commissioning phase of one of the first ITORs in Canada. A multistaged evaluation project to support clinical commissioning was facilitated engaging 24 stakeholder groups. Key evaluation objectives highlighted include the evaluation of two transport routes, switching of operating room (OR) tabletops, the use of the C-arm, and timely access to lead in the OR. Multiple evaluation methods were used including observation, debriefing, time-based metrics, distance wheel metrics, equipment adjustment counts, and other transport route considerations. The evaluation resulted in several types of data that allowed for informed decision making for the most effective, efficient, and safest transport route for an exsanguinating trauma patient and healthcare team; improved efficiencies in use of the C-arm, significantly reduced the time to access lead; and uncovered a new process for switching OR tabletop due to safety threats identified.

Burnout is a severe problem among nurses. Literature shows a relationship between stress and burnout and between nature exposure and stress. However, the possible consequent relationship between connection to nature and nurse burnout needs further study. This cross-sectional study explored the relationship between the subscales (Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment [EE, DP, and PA]) of the Maslach Burnout Inventory as \"outcome variables\" and perception of view duration, frequency of exposure to views, view content and artwork content as \"explanatory variables\" in a subset regression model. The study model also included organizational stressors, environmental design factors, unit type, workload, and personal factors as control variables. Fifty-one nurses working in six units in a large tertiary care hospital participated in the study. Percentage of perceived nature views and organizational stressors were the top two best predictors correlating with EE (37% of the EE variance; p &lt; .05). Percentage of perceived nature views, organizational stressors, and environmental design were the top three predictors correlating with DP (43% of variance for DP; p &lt; .05). No significant relationship was found between study variables and PA. The results of this study recommend perceiving nature views as an independent or integrated intervention to meditation and relaxation techniques.

However, at the forefront of healthcare interior design is the evidence-based design (EBD) process and the Universal Design (UD) guidelines. The Center for Health Design states that the EBD process differs from the linear design process, in that EBD uses relevant evidence to educate and guide the design decisions. The objective of this study was to support future EBD and UD use in the development of patient areas in breast care center interior design. The methods for this study incorporated an extensive review of the literature, examples of eight breast care centers around the world, observations, an interview, and a staff survey concerning the interior design of a local breast care center. The results revealed that using the EBD process and UD, to develop guidelines for patient areas in breast care centers' interior design, directors could use guidelines to evaluate existing breast care centers or preconstruction for new breast care centers. This study concluded with design guidelines for patient areas in breast care center interior design. The recommended guidelines targeted the following features: robes (vs. hospital gowns), spa-like atmosphere, monochromatic color scheme, use of wood and stone, private check-in areas, wayfinding, room temperature comfort, seating comfort, seating style choices including bariatric, personal items storage, access to natural light, indirect artificial lighting, living plants, views of nature, flooring comfort, and wheelchair accessibility.","114":"This study investigated the stability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on 16 common environmental surface materials. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of severe coronavirus disease, a significant public health concern that quickly led to a pandemic. Contamination of environmental surface materials is of concern, with previous studies identifying long-term detection of infectious particles on surfaces. These contaminated surfaces create an increased risk for contact transmission. Surface materials were inoculated with 10,000 plaque forming units and samples were collected 4, 8, 12, 24, 30, 48, and 168 hours post infection (hpi). Viral titers were determined for each sample and time point using plaque assays. Nonparametric modeling utilized the Turnbull algorithm for interval-censored data. Maximum likelihood estimates for the survival curve were calculated. Parametric proportional hazards regression models for interval censored data were used to explore survival time across the surface materials. There was a sharp decline in recoverable virus after 4 hpi for all tested surfaces. By 12 hpi, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was recoverable from only four surfaces; and by 30 hr, the virus was recoverable from only one surface. There were differences in survival curves based on the materials although some groups of materials are similar, both statistically and practically. While very low amounts of infectious SARS-CoV-2 are recoverable over time, there remains a risk of viral transmission by surface contamination in indoor environments. Individuals and institutions must follow appropriate procedures to decontaminate indoor environment and increase diligence for hand hygiene and personal protective equipment.

The aim of the investigation is to evaluate the benefits of 20-30 minutes in contact with nature. The Scientific Community, also through the evidence-based design approach, has already demonstrated the importance of greenery and nature on the psychophysical well-being of people and, in a moment of emergency, contact with the nature can be therapeutic and quite influential on the mental health of staff subject to stress. During the lockdown, an Italian multidisciplinary working group promoted an experience-based survey, based on the Profile of Mood States methodology, for measuring the psychophysical well-being of hospital staff. The author collected 77 questionnaires. The benefits that users have obtained from the experience in nature have been investigated by comparing the type of stresses they were subjected to and highlighting various peculiarities in the data analysis associated with the type of green in which they carried out the survey, the healthcare areas in which they worked during the pandemic emergency, and the moment in which the survey was conducted. The study has highlighted that a short break in green spaces strongly influenced the mental and psychophysical well-being of hospital staff, emphasizing the importance of nearby green spaces in architectures for health. Even a brief break in nature can regenerate users, especially in times of a stressful health emergency. ","116":"","117":"The research sheds light on the challenges and limitations of Spanish and Italian hospital design by looking at the gaps between education and practice. Hospital design plays an important role in providing high-quality and cost-effective facilities for any healthcare system. Spain and Italy face contemporary challenges (i.e., elderly population, staff retention, and obsolete healthcare facilities) and have similar issues of life expectancy, health expenditure, hospital beds provision, and decentralized tax-financed healthcare systems. A cross-sectional, mixed-method study was used. This involved two different data collection strategies and analysis for each area of investigation: (i) education and (ii) practice. For the former, educational programs were reviewed via a web search; for the latter, an online survey of 53 architectural\/engineering offices involved in hospital design was conducted. Hospital design education is limited to 0\/58 in Spanish and 2\/60 courses in Italian universities, although each country offers three postgraduate courses. The practitioners' survey shows that even though their offices have a long history of healthcare design, only 48% in Spain and 60% in Italy have received specific university training. Office staff lack employees with medical backgrounds, which hinders any partnership between health and design fields either for design practice or the education fields. Laws, national regulations, technical guidelines, and previous experience are the most useful information sources, while international scientific publications appear underused by practitioners. Italian and Spanish healthcare architecture could be improved by promoting multidisciplinary teams (in practice and education) and improving the education offer by tailoring it to national needs. ","118":"To measure hospital visitors' satisfaction with a rooftop atrium and its resultant impact on the visitors' behavioral intentions toward the healing garden, the hospital, and overall satisfaction with the hospital. There is a significant lack of empirical research that links the emotional and behavioral responses toward healing gardens and the hospitals providing them. A purposeful sample of 96 visitors to the healing garden in the rooftop atrium of a surgery building in a major hospital in the Southeastern United States completed a survey based on Roger Ulrich's Theory of Supportive Gardens and the Stimulus, Organism, Response (S-O-R) paradigm. Findings of this study suggest visitors' experience with the healing garden can lead to overall satisfaction with the hospital and behavioral intentions toward the hospital. Visitors' satisfaction with the healing garden significantly predicted their satisfaction with the hospital, their intend to revisit the hospital, and their intend to recommend it. This study demonstrates that a small healing garden can be a powerful enough space to impact visitors' overall satisfaction with the hospital and their intentions regarding their future behavior toward the hospital, such as revisiting or recommending the hospital. ","119":"","120":"In this work, we aim to have a better understanding of the impact of the architectural ambiance on patient well-being, by exploring patient's perception of physical ambiantal factors in their rooms. Perception of ambiantal factors is beginning to be relatively documented in space psychology, including health. There is no research in this field in Algeria; therefore, we would like to fill this gap and draw attention to the importance of the ambiantal physical factors in our hospitals. We conducted a practical study via a 19-item questionnaire at the neurology hospitalization department of two hospitals. This is complemented by in situ observations and reactivated observations. Descriptive, principal component analysis and statistical tests were applied on the responses. Thirteen ambiantal physical items studied were all classified relatively medium with mean scores ranging between -0.55 &lt; mean &lt; 1.34, with SD 0.765, on a scale of -2 to 2. Patients therefore consider the room ambiance medium. Patients' satisfaction and well-being results meet with findings about ambiantal physical factors. Neurological diseases affect patient cognition, which increase the importance of space-sensitive perception. The bad general condition of the building is negatively pointed in all testimonies of the questioned, especially spatial organization with multiple occupation room. The results indicate that reflection should be oriented on the design of single or double rooms, taking into account the emotional (sensitive) state of the patient, by integrating ambiantal physical factors (natural lighting variable, sound variable, thermal variable, olfactory variable), to contribute significantly to their well-being. ","121":"While healthcare design research has primarily focused on patient outcomes, there is a growing recognition that environmental interventions could do more by promoting the overall quality of care, and this requires expanding the focus to the health and well-being of those who deliver care to patients. Healthcare professionals are under high levels of stress, leading to burnout, job dissatisfaction, and poor patient care. Among other tools, mindfulness is recommended as a way of decreasing stress and helping workers function at higher levels. This article aims to identify potential environmental strategies for reducing work-related stressors and facilitating mindfulness in healthcare settings. By examining existing evidence on workplace mindfulness and stress-reducing design strategies, we highlight the power of the physical environment in not only alleviating stressful conditions but intentionally encouraging a mindful perspective. Strategies like minimizing distractions or avoiding overstimulation in the healthcare environment can be more effective if implemented along with the provision of designated spaces for mindfulness-based programs. Future research may explore optimal methods and hospital workers' preferences for environments that support mindfulness and stress management. The long-term goal of all these efforts is to enhance healthcare professionals' well-being, reignite their professional enthusiasm, and help them be resilient in times of stress.","122":null,"123":"The objective of this study was to examine changes in healthcare practitioners' perception of supportiveness of their physical work environment, and trend in patient fall, when moving from a centralized to a decentralized unit configuration. Previous studies on decentralization have not uniformly provided findings consistent with desired outcome. A pretest-posttest study was conducted in an elective surgery medical-surgical unit in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The independent variable was the physical design supporting centralized versus decentralized nursing models. Data were collected from healthcare staff with a self-report survey \"before\" (September 2017; n = 42) and \"after\" (June 2019; n = 22), and interviews. Before-after data were analyzed using both parametric and nonparametric tests to identify significant differences. Qualitative responses were analyzed to identify triangulating evidences. Monthly patient fall data were collected for a 3-year period and analyzed using log-linear Poisson Regression model. Results show favorable assessments in the areas of overall supportiveness of design, equipment and soiled utility location, peer support, process flow visualization, and overall satisfaction. A reduction in patient falls was observed. Unfavorable outcomes were found in the contexts of walking distance, multidisciplinary collaboration, alarm audibility, nurse station size, and PPE location. This study underscores that the success of a unit cannot be achieved without coordinated and successful interventions in the areas of operations, processes, policies, culture, and the physical design.

Also, this research aims to suggest a new lighting solution to compensate for older adults' vision impairment and challenges at home for a successful aging place. In the normal aging process, more than 30% of older adults have a vision impairment, which negatively affects health and well-being of older adults such as limited activities, falling, loneliness, depression, anxiety, and a sense of control. Via a mixed method study design, residents in senior living communities were asked to describe the adequacy of light levels and specific tasks and needs related to lighting at their home. In addition to the survey and interview, indoor lighting assessments were conducted during the in-home session. The research findings highlighted older adults' experience and perception of lighting in their homes. Paired-sample t test indicated that there were statistically significant differences in light levels between normal conditions and full capacity conditions in all spaces. In order to address various challenges which older adults have been experiencing in their home for a long time, this research suggests new smart lighting platform which provides a proper level of illumination in older adult's homes. Such a smart platform is proactive and can dynamically adjust the smart devices or lighting fixtures in situ, while older adults are performing certain tasks.","126":"This was a study conducted in Atlanta, GA, in the United States with Chinese elderly immigrants, examining the relationship between visual preference and motivation to walk in a particular outdoor space. Outdoor walking promotes the well-being of older adults. However, their declined body functions impact their motivation to walk outside. For elderly immigrants living in a country with different cultural backgrounds from their homelands, it is important to find the ways to enhance their motivation of outdoor walking. Visual preference survey was conducted to assess preferences of first-generation Chinese elderly immigrants attending a care facility setting. Preferences included Chinese classical walking spaces or American modern walking spaces. The data were interpreted using descriptive statistics and factorial experiment analysis. A total of 95 Chinese elderly immigrants gave valid responses to the visual preference survey. Survey results revealed that respondents had a high preference for Chinese classical walking spaces even though they had an average time of 26 years as a U.S. resident. Although the functions and purposes of the walking spaces caused safety and comfort concerns, the interaction effects of design style, design function, and design purpose illustrated that Chinese classical style had high effectiveness to promote outdoor walking of Chinese elderly immigrants. These results support the significance of culturally sensitive care environments in promoting outdoor walking for elderly Chinese immigrants. It also indicates that spaces designed with an assigned cultural style had higher attractiveness to older adults from the same assigned cultural background. ","127":"This article explores how the building-scale built environment is associated with self-rated health, examining differences in this association among younger, middle-aged, and older age groups. Features examined included building type, building condition, and sidewalk presence in front of dwellings. Understanding how the relationships between built environments and health vary across age groups helps to build a healthy environment for all. However, most studies have concentrated on the neighborhood or indoor environment, rather than whole buildings, and few have compared age groups. This study analyzed survey data from 1,019 adults living in 40 neighborhoods in Chengdu, China, recruited through a clustered random sampling approach. It used a Bayesian logistic mixed-effects model with interaction terms between age-group indicators and other variables. Significant differences exist in the relationships of self-rated health with some environmental and other indicators among age groups. For older people, living in multi-floor buildings, having a household smoker, and undertaking fewer hours of weekly exercise were associated with lower odds of reporting good, very good, or excellent health. These relationships were not identified among middle-aged and younger people. More education was associated with higher odds of reporting better health among older and middle-aged groups. Older people experience more health-related challenges compared to middle-aged and younger people. However, among the examined built environment factors, building type was the only significant factor related to self-rated health among older people. To promote health among older people, this study recommends adding elevators in the multi-floor buildings. ","128":"Humanization is a challenge for the future of healthcare. Architecture may play a major role in designing spaces that enhance communication and help the patient to maintain mental health during physical illness. Health psychologists struggle to find adequate space for taking care of their patients. There is an urgent need to better define how relational space, defined here as potential, can be guaranteed in everyday hospital psychological consultations. The author relates to his work as a health psychologist and psychotherapist in a consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) service operating in a general hospital in Lugano (Switzerland). An autoethnographic method is applied through calling on childhood memories on architecture and analyzing insights regarding the healthcare space in everyday work as a psychologist. Photographs and drawings are employed as evocative material. Autoethnographical data show that building interiors can be a metaphor for an inner dimension. Spaces can be perceived as depersonalized in hospital. Through psychoanalytical theory, it is argued that space becomes ideal for CLP if it can ensure the continuity of the patient's self during hospitalization. Proximity, confidentiality, and privacy are healthcare design requirements to be considered for favoring potential space and psychological intervention. Fostering potential space represents an outstanding challenge for the hospital of tomorrow in order to humanize healthcare spaces and promote a person-centered approach. ","129":"Our goal was to optimize infection control of paired environmental control interventions within hospitals to reduce methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). The most widely used infection control interventions are deployment of handwashing (HW) stations, control of relative humidity (RH), and negative pressure (NP) treatment rooms. Direct costs of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections are typically not included in the design of such interventions. We examined the effectiveness of pairing HW with RH and HW with NP. We used the following three data sets: A meta-analysis of progression rates from uncolonized to colonized to infected, 6 years of MDRO treatment costs from 400 hospitals, and 8 years of MDRO incidence rates at nine army hospitals. We used these data as inputs into an Infection De-Escalation Model with varying budgets to obtain optimal intervention designs. We then computed the infection and prevention rates and cost savings resulting from these designs. The average direct cost of an MDRO infection was $3,289, $1,535, and $1,067 for MRSA, CRE, and VRE. The mean annual incidence rates per facility were 0.39%, 0.034%, and 0.011% for MRSA, CRE, and VRE. After applying the cost-minimizing intervention pair to each scenario, the percentage reductions in infections (and annual direct cost savings) in large, community, and small acute care hospitals were 69% ($1.5 million), 73% ($631K), 60% ($118K) for MRSA, 52% ($460.5K), 58% ($203K), 50% ($37K) for CRE, and 0%, 0%, and 50% ($12.8K) for VRE. The application of this Infection De-Escalation Model can guide cost-effective decision making in hospital built environment design to improve control of MDRO infections.

Mental disorders are a major health problem worldwide and related to severe distress, functional disabilities, and heavy economical burdens. Studies propose that physical environment design can trigger or reduce mental disorder symptoms. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the extent of architectural design research contribution to all types of mental disorder prevention or intervention. A team of cross-disciplinary researchers gathered information from peer-reviewed manuscripts about the effect of architectural design on enhancing or reducing mental disorder symptoms. Data were collected from manuscripts published between 2008 and 2020 (research related to the topic became clearer in quality and quantity then). Keywords including architecture, interior design, physical environment, and mental disorders were used in the systematic search. Databases were collected using online resources. Numerical data collected from quantitative studies were organized in tables. Our data showed that there were a lot of studies about dementia and autism; few studies about schizophrenia, anxiety, stress-related disorders, and depressive disorders; and no studies about the rest of the mental disorders. General environment followed by housing facility design were the most assessed physical environments for mental disorders. As all mental disorders can have a significant impact on the society, we conclude that architectural studies should focus more on improving or preventing the symptoms of all types of mental disorders through the design of physical environments.

Design practitioners tend to heavily rely on previous design experience and precedents rather than utilization and application of research. Research can facilitate the evaluation and creation of innovative design solutions. Integrating research has been a challenge for the design industry. The study utilized an online survey to solicit feedback from architects and interior designers in the healthcare sector through a snowball sampling approach. The survey comprised closed-ended and open-ended questions categorized into three distinct sections, each focusing on one of the study objectives. A total of 115 participants completed the questionnaire. Practitioners tend to integrate research into the early design phases and programming. It is recognized as a tool for design enhancement by 62%, while 7% considered it to be a hindrance to their creativity. Primary data collection methods include collaboration with colleagues and user groups rather than journals and trade magazines. Cost, time, and lack of expertise are the top three hurdles in applying research in practice. Practitioners have a positive attitude toward research, perceive it as an impactful design enhancement tool, and use it to promote their credibility. Lack of research expertise hinders the use and conduct of research. According to design practitioners, research is costly and time-consuming and impedes their ability to fulfill clients' goals and the project timeline.

Through this communication, we wish to reiterate the importance of structural risk factors such as space surrounding the patient, furniture with focus on construction and finishing materials used, and ventilation systems surrounding the patient as risk factors for HAIs and expect that these find a place in HAI prevention guidelines in the future.","133":"To identify design strategies utilized in airborne infection isolation and biocontainment patient rooms that improve infection control potential in an alternative care environment. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads and health care facilities near or exceed capacity, facilities may implement alternative care sites (ACSs). With COVID-19 surges predicted, developing additional capacity in alternative facilities, including hotels and convention centers, into patient care environments requires early careful consideration of the existing space constraints, infrastructure, and modifications needed for patient care and infection control. Design-based strategies utilizing engineering solutions have the greatest impact, followed by medical and operational strategies. This article evaluates infection control and environmental strategies in inpatient units and proposes system modifications to ACS surge facilities to reduce infection risk and improve care environments. Although adequate for an acute infectious disease outbreak, existing capacity in U.S. biocontainment units and airborne infection isolation rooms is not sufficient for widespread infection control and isolation during a pandemic. To improve patients' outcomes and decrease infection transmission risk in the alternative care facility, hospital planners, administrators, and clinicians can take cues from evidence-based strategies implemented in biocontainment units and standard inpatient rooms. Innovative technologies, including optimized air-handling systems with ultraviolet and particle filters, can be an essential part of an infection control strategy. For flexible surge capacity in future ACS and hospital projects, interdisciplinary design and management teams should apply strategies optimizing the treatment of both infectious patients and minimizing the risk to health care workers.

This study builds on previous research to determine the preferred types of artwork (landscape vs. abstract) in the hospital setting as well as the influence of the art itself. Participants engaged in surveys with predefined single-choice responses and semistructured one-on-one interviews. Data were obtained from 45 participants, 15 from each of the units (Landscape, Abstract, or Mixed). A higher percentage of participants reported a positive impact on the Landscape Unit; however, the positive responses on the Abstract and Mixed Units were also notable. Eighty-two percent of responses from patients on the Abstract Unit were positive, as were 82% from the Landscape Unit and the Mixed Unit. Although landscape was preferred, abstract and mixed art also had positive responses and abstract did not have a negative effect. All genres of art have a place in a hospital; however, strategies should be developed that include more education, engagement, and interpretation of the artwork. ","136":"Over the past several years, a new problem affecting the elderly population has been increasingly reported in popular press-the elderly population is dying as a result of loneliness and related factors at a rate greater than that of lack of medical care. The problem is so pervasive that loneliness is being described as an epidemic. The objective of this inquiry was to examine whether the physical design of the lived environments could contribute to reducing loneliness in the elderly population. A combination of scoping and conceptual review of published literature was adopted for the study. The process involved multiple phases of searching, and a review was conducted at each stage. Databases targeted include PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SocINDEX. In all, 44 articles and books were subjected to in-depth analyses of underlying concepts, constructs, relationships, and empirical findings. Several theories including meaning in life theory, lifespan ego-development theory, symbolic interaction theory, proxemics, and affordance theory suggest that the design of the physical environment may have a role in addressing loneliness in the elderly. A potential explanatory model articulating the causal pathway is presented in this article. Between theoretical propositions and empirical literature, there exist grounds to assert that a plausible causal pathway exists between the physical environment and loneliness in the elderly population. The explanatory pathway suggests that the physical design could play both a direct and moderating role in influencing loneliness.

The lighting conditions studied represent design standards consistent with different environments of care-traditional, contemporary, and future. Recent advances in lighting research and technology create opportunities to use lighting in hospital rooms to improve everyday experience and provide researchers with opportunities to explore a new set of research questions about the effects of lighting on patients, guests, and staff. This study focuses on the experience of nurses delivering simulated patient care. Perceptions of each of the 13 lighting conditions were evaluated by nurses using rating scales for difficulty of task completion, comfort, intensity, appropriateness of the lighting color, and naturalness of the lighting during the task. The nurses' ratings were analyzed alongside qualitative reflections to provide insight into their responses. Significant differences were found for several a priori hypotheses. Interesting findings provide insight into lighting to support circadian synchronization, lighting at night, the distribution of light in the patient room and the use of multiple lighting zones, and the use of colored lighting. The results of this study provide insight into potential benefits and concerns of these new features for patient room lighting systems and reveal gaps in the existing evidence base that can inform future investigations. ","139":"The objective of this discussion paper is to deepen the discourse on the complex interrelationship between \"healing architecture\" and \"safe architecture,\" here labeled \"The healing and safety complex,\" for the benefit of those who want to make informed decisions in the design of future psychiatric wards. Today's psychiatric care sets the patient at the forefront. As a part of this ambition, the discussion regarding the patient's physical environment has also advanced. At the same time, staff are exposed to increasing threats and violence in their everyday work, which can lead to severe personal psychological suffering as well as physical injuries. The requirements of patients and staff are sometimes conflicting which has ethical implications. The reasoning and arguments presented here mainly derive from discussions and dialogue with psychiatric facility management and other healthcare professionals in multidisciplinary working groups during the design process. Offering patients and staff a healing and safe environment is the most important architectural challenge in the design of psychiatric wards. How architects, management, and staff evaluate and balance the two aspects will have a crucial impact on the building's final design and atmosphere and thereby influence staff and patient safety as well as civil protection. In everyday practice, it is up to the multidisciplinary design teams and management to become better informed in order to make \"the right decisions to the best of their ability\" as evidence is still limited when it comes to \"The healing and safety complex.\" ","140":"This research aimed to evaluate the quantitative effects of new hospital design on adult inpatient outcomes. Tenets of evidence-based healthcare design, notably single-patient acuity-adaptable and same-handed rooms, decentralized nursing stations, onstage offstage layout, and access to nature were expected to promote patient healing and increase patient satisfaction, while decreasing adverse events. Patient healing was operationalized through length of stay (LOS) and patient safety through three adverse events: falls, hospital-acquired infections (HAI), and medication-related events. Standard patient surveys captured patient satisfaction. Patient records from 2013 through 2017 allowed for equivalent time periods surrounding the move to the new hospital in August 2015. Stratified by hospital division where significant, pre\/post comparisons utilized proportional hazards or logistic regression models as appropriate; interrupted time series analyses afforded longitudinal interpretations. Observed higher postmove LOS was due to previously increasing trends, not increases after the move. In surgical and trauma units, a constant increase in falls was unaffected by the move. Medication events decreased consistently over time; medication events with harm dropped significantly after the move. No change in HAI was found. Significant improvement on most relevant patient satisfaction items occurred after the move. Call button response decreased immediately after the move but subsequently improved. Results did not clearly indicate a net change in adult inpatient outcomes of healing and safety due to the hospital design. There was evidence that the new hospital improved patient satisfaction outcomes related to the environment, including comfort, noise, temperature, and aesthetics. ","141":"","142":"To address prolonged lengths of stay (LOS) in a Level 1 trauma center, we examined the impact of implementing two data-driven strategies with a focus on the physical environment. Crowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a widely reported problem leading to increased service times and patients leaving without being seen. Using ED historical data and expert estimates, we created a discrete-event simulation model. We analyzed the likely impact of initiating care and boarding patients in the hallway (hallway care) instead of the exam rooms and adding a dedicated triage space for patients who arrive by emergency medical services (EMS triage) to decrease hallway congestion. The scenarios were compared in terms of LOS, time spent in exam rooms and hallway spaces, service time, blocked time, and utilization rate. The hallway care scenario resulted in significantly lower LOS and exam room time only for EMS patients but when implemented along with the EMS triage scenario, a significantly lower LOS and exam room time was observed for all patients (EMS and walk-in). The combination of two simulated scenarios resulted in significant improvements in other flow metrics as well. Our findings discourage boarding of admitted patients in ED exam rooms. If space limitations require that admitted patients be placed in ED hallways, designers and planners should consider enabling hallway spaces with features recommended in this article. Alternative locations for boarding should be prioritized in or out of the ED. Our findings also encourage establishing a triage area dedicated to EMS patients in the ED. ","143":"With the reactivating hospital concept, it is our goal to provide a more active stay in a hospital for patients by diverting the focus away from \"lying in bed.\" We want to achieve this by changing the spatial environment of the nursing ward. These new spatial interventions are aimed toward helping the patients to be healthier during and after their admission to the hospital. When it comes to hospitals, we tend to have a mindset that is basically focused on disease, not on health. The whole hospital is geared toward illness, waiting, lying in bed: a passive attitude of the patient in this medical stronghold. Staying in a hospital has a negative influence on the body, especially for vulnerable patients. However, when patients remain active during their hospital stay, fewer negative effects occur. The risk of complications reduces, and patients recover better and faster. Research shows that only 15% of patients actually need to stay in bed. In order to enable hospitals and their patients to benefit from these insights, Gortemaker Algra Feenstra Architects introduces the reactivating hospital concept: a set of scientifically based practical interventions intended for a change in organization and spatial design of hospitals. How can spatial interventions to a geriatric department contribute positively to activating elderly patients during their stay in the hospital? What impact does providing areas for activation away from a patient's bed have on the quality of the patient's experience? The reactivating hospital concept no longer revolves around \"lying in bed,\" but around the notion of \"making patients stronger.\" We are introducing a new rhythm of 8 hr of activation, 8 hr of relaxation, and 8 hr of sleep. This requires a different mindset of patients and personnel and involves a totally different interpretation of space. To tackle the problem at its roots, the bed will be solely reserved for sleeping and all other activities will take place elsewhere in the nursing ward. To encourage patients to remain active, we soften the transition from bed to room, from room to corridor, from corridor to department, and from department to the rest of the hospital. These subtle transitions invite patients to move around, thus remaining active. To test these methods, we use qualitative and quantitative research methods such as observation, conversations with focus groups, and questionnaires during the research. Reactivating hospital concept is a concept and a design research in progress in collaboration with the existing Diakonessenhuis hospital and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). In this setting, there are different scales of innovation. In the first phase, we have been working on a completely new bed department with a new typology. In the second phase, we are currently testing significant changes in a room, corridor, and department level, within the context of the existing department, and we are measuring and monitoring the results. The first research results show a positive effect on the state of mind of patients as well as the nurses. At this moment, we are researching the positive effect on the exercise and health of patients, and we are expecting the first concrete results to come in at the end of the year. The initial feedback we have received from the Diakonessenhuis hospital has been positive. Furthermore, we have noticed that the reactivating hospital concept is receiving more and more support. Lying in bed has a negative effect on patients, and a lot of hospitals are aware of this and are therefore looking for alternatives. ","144":"This opinion paper posits that there is a misalignment of how the theory of salutogenesis is defined by scholars and the way that salutogenesis is reflected in architectural practice. Many practitioners use this term to describe their work without a clear understanding of the social theory behind it. A background on the original theory, brief review of its subsequent development, and the importance of stress in determining health are explored. Antonovsky, originator of the salutogenesis theory, believed that health was represented by a spectrum ranging from disease to wellness and that stress and an individual's ability to respond to it determined where they would be on that spectrum. His work indicates that one's resources determined the impact of a stressor. The elements Antonovsky termed environmental generalized resistance resources (GRR) are considered because they are within the purview of design practitioners to influence. While Antonovsky's work became focused on an aspect of salutogenesis he termed sense of coherence (SOC), he encouraged exploration of additional aspects. This article proposes an expanded definition of salutogenesis that includes five aspects of environmental GRR that can address or alleviate specific causes of stress-SOC, biophilia, relaxation response, self-empowerment, and prospect and refuge. A more specific language and a common, consistent way of understanding what makes an environment salutogenic emerges with examples of each described. A common language will bring consistency to design practice and make complex social theories more accessible for practitioners, leading to them being more rigorously and universally applied in design.","145":"The majority of patient experience research has been conducted in culturally Western contexts without controlling for cultural and demographic variation. Designers are left with little choice but to apply contextually specific and demographically neutral research to a wide range of healthcare systems, cultural contexts, and demographic conditions. It is possible that some research will transfer and generate the intended outcomes. However, it is likely much will not, and there is currently little way of knowing what does and does not work in environments outside of those where the study was conducted. Healthcare design research conducted in a variety of sociocultural conditions could help to ensure healthcare facilities are designed to best suit the sociodemographic needs of their users and support the wider public health ambitions of the health system. Health inequalities that exist within and between nations are well-known, and while the systems and structures that inform these inequalities are complex, it is likely design can play a role in ensuring these inequalities are not exacerbated by the environments in which care is provided. In other words, while healthcare designers may not be able to affect the geographies of inequality outside health facilities, they should endeavor to impact those within. It is critical that studies be repeated in a wide variety of conditions and that design decisions be openly published, shared, and discussed to create a discourse around methods, ethics, and comparative studies in the field of Intersectional Healthcare Design Research.","146":"","147":"This descriptive case study of ambulatory care center typologies builds a layout-based approach to patient-centered care and care team work using theory and methods from space syntax and a recently developed approach to floorplan analysis focused on visibility. Calibrating support for care team work and patient centeredness is a persistent dilemma in ambulatory care settings. A review of literature and floorplan layout analysis are used. The center-stage layout more strongly integrates staff and patients, while the onstage-offstage layout provides greater privacy to the care team. The integration values for exam rooms in each layout were roughly equivalent. Analysis of variations on each floor plan demonstrates ways relatively small variations can modulate visibility conditions without altering integration patterns. Decoupling design of immediate visual properties and relational layout properties can act as a strategy to address competing demands. ","148":"This study aims to explore the impacts of visibility and accessibility of alcohol gel-based hand sanitizer dispensers (HSDs) on healthcare workers' hand-hygiene (HH) behaviors. Despite the importance of HH in reducing nosocomial infection, few empirical studies have quantitatively investigated the impacts of unit shape and size, and the resulted visibility and accessibility on HH, due to the lack of consistent methods to measure and evaluate visibility. The research was developed as a cross-sectional comparative study of two nursing units (Units A and B) with similar patient acuity and nursing care model but different shape and layout. The study applied quantitative research methods including visibility and accessibility analysis using space syntax, 1-week on-site observation, and secondary data analysis on HH compliance rates. Results indicate that the unit with higher visibility and accessibility is associated with higher HH frequencies. Unit B has significantly higher visibility of HSDs, p &lt; .001, t(60) = 4.615, and significantly higher frequency of HH activity occurrences, 5.17% versus 1.52%; p &lt; .001, t(16.750) = 5.332, than Unit A, even though Unit B has lower HSD to bed ratio (0.708:1 vs. 1.375:1). The linear regression models also demonstrate that visibility and accessibility of HSDs are significant predictors of HH behavior. Overall, this exploratory study identified the importance of visibility of HSDs to improve the chances of HH. It also points out the impacts of nursing unit typology on the visibility of HSDs and in turn affects HH behavior. ","149":"This research aimed to investigate the major user behavior patterns of noise sources in healthcare environments and summarize such information as evidence that can inform the design of maternity wards for indoor noise control and patients' well-being. Field investigations were conducted to identify users' behaviors as the major contributors of noises in the maternity wards of a typical hospital. A control experiment was set to test the feasibility of a noise control system that consisted of smart bracelets, mobile terminals, and monitors. Comparative studies were designed for statistical analysis of patients' sleep quality and satisfaction. Finally, a follow-up interview was conducted among the experts who were from the fields of healthcare environment design, medical treatments, and hospital administration to shed an insight into their concerns on the findings. The enclosed waiting areas, instead of open ones that were often seen in hospitals, around the entrances of operation rooms, were considered as the appropriate design strategy for maternity wards in China. Such a design could keep patients from being exposed to the excessive noises generated by visitors during nighttime, although it would occupy the floor area of wards and lead to a reduction of beds. Moreover, the statistical information of patients' behaviors could be used to moderate visitors' behaviors. It was necessary to include user behavior information in building information management and then make a good trade-off between the proportions of wards and enclosed waiting rooms in order to achieve a balance of medical efficiency and environmental satisfaction. ","150":"The purpose of this study was to identify assessments used to evaluate the homes of people with disabilities in terms of accessibility, usability, activities, comfort\/satisfaction, and aesthetics. The home is increasingly becoming an environment for healthcare as more people desire to age in place. Research indicates home environmental modifications to be beneficial to promote a better person-environment fit, especially when using a standardized assessment approach. There is not a comprehensive list of assessments that address home modifications, adaptations, or interior designs for people with disabilities. Researchers conducted a rapid review of articles, with data collection scales, instruments, and procedures for home modifications published between 2000 and 2017. A total of 26 articles met the inclusion criteria, resulting in the identification of 33 distinct assessments, including 18 assessments evaluating the accessibility of home modifications, 3 assessments examining usability, 15 assessments addressing activities of daily living or functional activities, and 5 assessments addressing comfort and\/or satisfaction. No assessments for aesthetics were located. Researchers developed a list of assessments that could be used for research or practice. Further research is needed to address the lack of assessments focusing on the aesthetics or attractiveness of home modifications, as well as more assessments tailored to specific diagnoses and population groups. ","151":"This study proposes a computational model to evaluate patient room design layout and features that contribute to patient stability and mitigate the risk of fall. While common fall risk assessment tools in nursing have an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity, they focus on intrinsic factors and medications, making risk assessment limited in terms of how the physical environment contributes to fall risk. We use literature to inform a computational model (algorithm) to define the relationship between these factors and the risk of fall. We use a trajectory optimization approach for patient motion prediction. Based on available data, the algorithm includes static factors of lighting, flooring, supportive objects, and bathroom doors and dynamic factors of patient movement. This preliminary model was tested using four room designs as examples of typical room configurations. Results show the capabilities of the proposed model to identify the risk associated with different room layouts and features. This innovative approach to room design evaluation and resulting estimation of patient fall risk show promise as a proactive evidence-based tool to evaluate the relationship of potential fall risk and room design. The development of the model highlights the challenge of heterogeneity in factors and reporting found in the studies of patient falls, which hinder our understanding of the role of the built environment in mitigating risk. A more comprehensive investigation comparing the model with actual patient falls data is needed to further refine model development. ","152":"The purpose of this methodology is to provide the designers of wayfinding systems in healthcare facilities a process for evaluating and optimizing a design prior to implementation. The use of this methodology can improve patient experience in hospitals by preventing the installation of confusing, incomplete, and\/or frustrating wayfinding systems. Despite known wayfinding and information design principles, wayfinding continues to be a challenge in healthcare environments. One reason is that the design of wayfinding systems is rarely evaluated with end users prior to implementation. The methodology outlined in this article is an application of usability testing that involves end users navigating a space using prototyped signage and other elements of a wayfinding system to determine the effectiveness of the system and identify improvement opportunities. This methodology was developed for use in an emergency department that had outdated signage and required a new wayfinding system. This methodology provides a structured process for testing and improving the design of a hospital wayfinding system prior to implementation. ","153":"This article states that a consciously applied, design-driven dialogue can improve healing architecture. There are different forms of knowledge, beyond evidence, which are partly hidden from our consciousness. We call this type of knowledge tacit. By using a design-driven dialogue, where staff and management participate in the design process, this tacit knowledge may transform into a more conscious and explicit one, a kind of knowledge that will inform the architect's work in a richer way and thereby increase the possibilities for improving healthcare architecture. Among proponents of evidence-based design (EBD), there has been an aspiration toward rigor to avoid arbitrary decision making. The concept of evidence has been put forward as a way to achieve this. Some of the advocates of EBD have looked upon subjective and aesthetic decisions with great skepticism. However, today, there is a growing number of architects who have lately become critical of that attitude in design. They search for alternative ways to understand the use of different kinds of knowledge in order to promote better architecture. This article aims to overcome some contradictions between different ways of looking at the design process. This discussion article is based on personal introspection and literature studies. The personal experiences referred to stem from three major design projects for general and forensic psychiatric care facilities. This article presents a tentative design theory on how a design-driven dialogue process can be formed in order to achieve better outcomes in healthcare architecture. How the design-process is driven has a vital influence for the physical environment and its impact on treatment outcomes. ","154":"This study focused on township hospitals in the cold regions of China and aimed to evaluate patient satisfaction during the medical care process. This study also discusses the correlation between patient needs and satisfaction. Hospitals seek to improve patient satisfaction to provide better service. However, there is a lack of existing literature on grassroots medical institutions in towns and townships, especially in cold regions. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the correlation between patient needs and the satisfaction of township hospitals in the cold regions of China. First, a hierarchical task analysis method was used to build the hierarchy for patient satisfaction demands. Patients from 15 township hospitals in cold areas were subjected to semistructured interviews, and a theoretical model was proposed using the grounded theory method. Finally, each open code index was evaluated, and 270 questionnaires were issued to evaluate patient satisfaction. The framework for patient satisfaction demands included five dimensions: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. A theoretical model for patient satisfaction demands was built, and four selective codes, including \"Characteristic\", \"Perceived Quality\", \"Loyalty Intention\", and \"Environment Expectation\", were extracted. The weights of these satisfaction-influencing factors were subsequently evaluated. This study summarizes the existing problems in a basic health service provision capacity, climate adaptability, lack of environmental design, and so on; proposes four influencing factors; establishes a patient satisfaction evaluation model; and obtains the weight of influence of each factor. These results will help provide accurate and effective suggestions for hospital management. ","155":"To investigate: (1) the types of health information, resources, and supports available to consumers in hospital outpatient waiting areas and (2) whether these are accessed by consumers. Outpatient waiting areas commonly offer health information, resources, and supports to improve the health literacy of waiting consumers. It is not known what is available to or accessed by consumers in hospital outpatient rehabilitation waiting areas. A multicenter, prospective, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in the waiting areas of two hospital outpatient rehabilitation services. Direct observations (in person and video recordings) of the waiting areas were used to describe what health information, resources, and supports were available and, if present, what was being accessed and for how long by consumers. Fifteen hours of in-person and video-recorded observations were documented on purpose-designed instruments across the two sites during 18 observation sessions over 8 days. A total of 68 different health information and resources were identified. Approximately half were specifically for consumers (Site 1: 57%; Site 2: 53%). Only seven (10%) were accessed by consumers across both sites. Each resource (n = 7) was only accessed once. Health resources were used by consumers for 0.8% (3\/360 min) of the observation time at each site. Health and social supports and use of other non health resources were also observed. Available health information, resources, and supports were infrequently and briefly accessed by consumers. Further research is required to explore what consumers want and need to improve the health literacy responsiveness of hospital outpatient waiting areas. ","156":"Research was conducted to evaluate the correlation between design hypotheses and performance outcomes in single-occupancy patient rooms. Health environments host complex interactions between patients and clinicians, and patient rooms offer a unique lens to understanding the impact of design on interactions and outcomes. This places importance on articulating, measuring, and assessing design hypotheses. This study of documented strategies and measured outcomes in patient room design investigates the relationship between design variables and clinical interactions. Design hypotheses were identified for the strategic approach to four key elements of patient room design: the room configuration, charting location, personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, and mobile supply cart. Researchers collected observational data from existing and newly constructed patient rooms in order to evaluate performance outcomes related to design hypotheses. Observation data supported hypotheses behind three of the four design components and revealed greater insight into how design variables impacted interactions in patient rooms. The study identified a distinction between \"fixed\" design elements, such as the configuration of the patient room, and \"dynamic\" elements such as the design of the mobile cart. This was more prevalent in evaluating the use of supply carts and PPE cabinets, which may be more influenced by training, while the room configuration and charting location require little training to benefit both clinicians and patients. This study points to the value of research that evaluates correlations between design hypotheses and outcomes in healthcare design. ","157":"This study empirically investigates the relationships between visibility attributes and both patients' and staff members' teamwork experiences. Teamwork among healthcare professionals is critical for the safety and quality of patient care. While a patient-centered, team-based care approach is promoted in primary care clinics, little is known about how clinic layouts can support the teamwork experiences of staff and patients in team-based primary clinics. This article measured teamwork perceptions of staff members and patients at four primary care clinics providing team-based care. Visual access to staff workstations from both staff and patient perspectives was analyzed using VisualPower tool(version 21). The relationships between teamwork perception and visibility attributes were analyzed for each entity: staff members and patients. The results showed that the visual relationships among staff members and those between staff members and patients have significant associations with overall perceptions of teamwork. While clinics providing more visual connections between staff workstations reported higher teamwork perception of staff members, patient perceptions of staff teamwork were inversely related to the number of visual connections between patients and staff workstations. The findings of the study provide implications for designing team-based primary care clinics to enhance the teamwork experience of both staff members and patients, which is also applicable to teamwork perceptions in other settings where both inhabitants and visitors are main user groups of the spaces. This study illustrates the representational function of space: Organizations can emphasize their values via layout design by regulating what they show to inhabitants or visitors. ","158":"","159":"Our aim is to investigate how a new master studies course \"Architecture, Health, and Well-being\" (AHW) supports development of students' skills in understanding and assessing health-related research as well as applying research-based knowledge through unfolding of user perspectives in their design projects. With the growing focus on health-related research in Danish design practice, knowing how to translate research findings into research-informed design strategies becomes a preferable, if not (yet) a critical, skill. This calls for architecture educations to reconsider their graduate profiles and teaching curricula, thereby addressing research-to-practice gap. Based on design project hand-ins, we evaluate whether students participating in the AHW course demonstrate greater sensibility toward user experiences and research-based design (RBD) in their master thesis projects, compared to students attending a more traditional architectural tectonic track. Evaluation relates to the use of scientific literature and theoretical frameworks on topics like \"healing architecture\" and applied user-oriented methods (interviews, personas, demographics). Our explorative analysis indicates that students have the skills to make a detailed user analysis when it comes to well-defined user groups in a highly specialized building (e.g., hospice patients and staff). The extent to which health-related research and user perspectives are applied in the design process seems to be primarily driven by thematic focus of the project (welfare buildings in contrast to housing). Despite the challenges in teaching students to assess and apply academic literature, a RBD paradigm in architectural education can help bridge emerging research knowledge with design skills and professional competencies. ","160":"To identify the environmental factors essential for infection control in senior-living facilities. In the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are more likely to be infected and develop serious outcomes than young people. Worldwide, senior-living facilities face a battle to protect their residents. Compared with age-related declines, the built environment is more modifiable and can be used for infection control. This research conducted content analysis of the guidelines on COVID-19 control issued by the State Council of China in February 2020 for senior-living facilities. Six senior-living facility managers in China were interviewed and shared their experiences using these guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to identify the essential environmental factors for infection control. Environmental factors suggested in the guidelines were analyzed for three groups of infection-control strategies: keep COVID-19 from entering the facility, prevent COVID-19 spread in the facility, and manage infection and illness. Key topics of experience using the guidelines were identified, including residents' needs for social interaction and the difficulties of providing dedicated air-conditioning and circulation systems. Based on these analyses, from the perspective of environmental design, environmental factors essential for COVID-19 control in senior-living facilities were summarized at the site, building, and room levels. Proper planning and design of the built environment promote strategies for infection control in senior-living facilities. Findings can be used to guide the new design, renovation, and modification of senior-living facilities for COVID-19 control and future public health emergencies. ","161":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate environmental surface materials used in healthcare environments for material composition, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) viability, and a comparison of two disinfectants, a bleach germicidal cleaner and Decon7, a novel disinfectant. Contaminated environmental surfaces have been associated with outbreaks of healthcare-associated illness (HAIs). One in every 20 patients in U.S. acute care hospitals acquire a healthcare-associated illness, leading to consequences such as elevated morbidity, mortality, and a decrease in quality of life. In the patient environment, MRSA can remain viable from hours to up to 14 days. Environmental surface materials were evaluated as new and worn. Material composition and properties were assessed to evaluate surface integrity and the influence on the disinfection of MRSA. Inoculated materials were used to assess MRSA viability over time and the efficacy of a manufacturer's recommended cleaning and disinfection product compared to a novel disinfectant. Environmental surface materials respond differently in appearance and roughness, when mechanically worn. When measuring MRSA survival, at 24 hr, MRSA colony forming unit (CFU) counts were reduced on the copper sheet surface and solid surface with cupric oxide. By 72 hr, all MRSA counts were zero. Bleach and the novel disinfectant were equally effective at disinfecting MRSA from all surface types. This study highlights a gap in knowledge about the impact of type and wear of environmental surface materials used in healthcare environments on contamination with epidemiologically important organisms. In conclusion, environmental surface material wear, properties, and cleaning and disinfection efficacy are important factors to consider when addressing HAIs. ","162":"In recent times, numerous scientific articles have been published on the risks of exposure to infectious microorganisms in dental care settings. The main mode of transmission of such infectious organisms is primarily through bioaerosols generated during routine dental procedures which put both dental care providers and their patients at an increased risk of exposure. Other frequent modes of infection transmission often reported include cross contamination and inadequate adoption of infection control protocols. The main objective of this article is to highlight the findings of those studies that have reported on the routes and modes of transmission of infectious organisms in dental settings, to report possibilities of cross contamination in dental care settings, and also to report any breach in adherence to infection control protocols in dental care settings. We also intend to emphasize on standard infection control protocols and strategies that need to be considered in dental care settings during disease outbreaks like coronavirus disease (COVID-19).","163":"This study is the third in a series of investigations that explored the role of project user groups and how they impact on the design of a healthcare facility. Previous studies focused on a wide range of users, whereas this study sought the views of project clients. The \"project client\" represents the organization responsible for the procurement of a healthcare facility. \"Users\" will work in or \"use\" that building. With the input of project clients, this research focused on the user group process required for Australian and New Zealand publicly funded healthcare projects. It sought lessons to improve the process for future projects. Previous research findings, and an expanded literature review examining participatory design, were used to develop questions for semistructured interviews with selected project clients. Responses were transcribed and analyzed in terms of themes and subthemes using reflexive thematic analysis to develop a narrative that reports and discusses the findings. Although not all are recognized, many stakeholders influence design decisions. No history, rationale, terms of reference, or evaluations of the user group process were found, suggesting that although it is a \"given,\" the process could be enhanced. Useful suggestions for improving the user group process are offered. Evaluating the user group process, and learning from alternative approaches, may improve its outcomes. A project charter and terms of reference would support more effective decision making, while best practice guidelines and education for user group participants should be considered.

Content analysis was used to interpret themes emerging from nurses' subjective responses to open-ended items. Three of the facilities had older, traditional lighting systems; one had a contemporary framework. A theme of environmental control over both overhead and task lighting emerged from data from all items. Although controllability was among the \"best\" lighting attributes, more refinement is necessary for optimal staff productivity and patient satisfaction. Daylighting was also considered to be among the best attributes. Control over light level via additional dimming capability for patients, as well as additional light sources, was prominent across the four hospitals. Unique to the more modern facility, trespassing of light was problematic for nurses considering the experiences of patients-even where modern models exist, more attention can be paid to the ways in which window shades, and light sources outside of rooms, penetrate spaces and affect users. The finding that nurses and patients desire greater control over the lighting in patient rooms is consistent with Ulrich's theory of supportive design for healthcare and coincides with advances in lighting technology. Despite differences in the level of sophistication in lighting among the four facilities, control continues to be a primary concern for nurses. ","168":"To introduce a composite tool called Design Diagnostic that allows a rapid but triangulated insight into key areas of a facility combining the methods of shadowing, behavior mapping, surveys, interviews, photo-essays, and parametric analysis to determine key challenges and opportunities for improvement, identify future design drivers, and recommend simple \"do-now\" changes. Research-based practice relies on agile and nimble methods to investigate, evaluate, and apply research in project work. This requires the ability to scale methodologies, so they can provide actionable insights in often constrained time lines. Surveys, observations, space analytics, and lit reviews often need to be done in extremely short periods of time. In this article, we share how these processes can be condensed to meet time constraints of project time lines, with the critical reminder not to generalize contextually derived insights. Combining field research (shadowing and behavior mapping) with user engagement (interviews), user feedback (surveys), and analytics of the plan itself allows designers and owners to understand the relationship between design intent and operational outcome and be resource effective in capital planning projects. Scaling these methods to fit the time and resource availability, and ensuring that results are always reviewed and applied in context, is critical.

The healthcare environment may seem frightening and overwhelming in times when life-threatening conditions affect a family member or close friend and individuals visit the patient in an ICU. A two-bed patient room was refurbished to enhance the well-being of patients and their families according to the principles of evidence-based design (EBD). No prior research has used the Person-centred Climate Questionnaire-Family version (PCQ-F) or the semantic environment description (SMB) in the ICU setting. A sample of 99 visitors to critically ill patients admitted to a multidisciplinary ICU completed a questionnaire; 69 visited one of the two control rooms, while 30 visited the intervention room. For the dimension of everydayness in the PCQ-F, a significantly better experience was expressed for the intervention room (p &lt; .030); the dimension regarding the ward climate general was also perceived as higher in the intervention room (p &lt; .004). The factors of pleasantness (p &lt; .019), and complexity (p &lt; 0.049), showed significant differences favoring the intervention room in the SMB, with borderline significance on the modern factor (p &lt; .061). Designing and implementing an enriched healthcare environment in the ICU setting increases person-centered care in relation to the patients' visitors. This could lead to better outcomes for the visitors, for example, decreasing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, but this needs further investigations. ","170":"","171":"Quality patient care in primary care settings, especially for patients with complex long-term health needs, is improved by interprofessional collaborative practice. Effective collaboration is achieved in large part by frequent informal face-to-face \"on-the-fly\" communication between team members. Research undertaken in hospitals shows that interior architecture influences informal communication and collaboration between staff. However, little is known about how the interior architecture of primary care practices might facilitate or hinder informal communication and collaboration among primary care staff. This research explores the influence of primary care practice interior architecture on face-to-face on-the-fly communication for collaborative care. An observational study was undertaken to compare face-to-face informal interactions between staff in three primary care practices of differing interior architecture. Data collected from practices included: direct observations floor plans, photographs, interviews, and surveys. Most primary care staff engaged in frequent, brief face-to-face interactions, which appeared to be key to the delivery of effective collaboration. Features of primary care practice designs that were associated with increased frequency of staff interaction included shared spaces, staff proximity\/visibility, and the presence of convenient circulatory and transitional spaces where staff were able to easily engage in timely on-the-fly communication with colleagues. The interior architecture of primary care practices has an important impact on staff collaboration. Although more research is needed to investigate further details in more practices, close attention should nevertheless be paid to maximizing opportunities for brief face-to-face communication in well-designed shared spaces in primary care practices.

Globally, the incidence of violence against healthcare professionals is alarming. Poor environmental design has been identified as a risk factor of violence toward employees. The design of the physical setting in which healthcare is provided may moderate the incidence and severity of violence against healthcare workers. We conducted electronic database searches of PubMed and CINAHL through November 2018. Findings were organized according to four categories identified in the literature regarding crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) including natural surveillance, access control, territoriality, and other CPTED elements. Fifteen studies (published between 1991 and 2017) met the inclusion criteria. Of the 15 studies, 4 incorporated environmental interventions. In the 11 remaining studies, physical environment attributes (i.e., layout, location, ambient conditions, equipment) were among the factors affecting violent incidents and staff security. Most study settings were hospital-based (11, with 10 of those specifically focused on emergency departments), followed by behavioral health facilities (4 studies). Design-focused recommendations, such as providing a second door in a triage room and a sub-waiting area inside the treatment zone, were summarized according to CPTED categories. This review suggests that the physical environment in healthcare facilities may affect the incidence of violence by patients or visitors against staff. Further research is needed to identify environmental design strategies that may protect the safety of healthcare professionals. ","173":"Co-design with multiple tools is useful when end users' knowledge is important, especially when designers work with people unfamiliar with design. Many studies have highlighted the importance of nurses' participation in design, and such participation requires the development of techniques and tools to facilitate collaboration. This article analyzes how nurses participated in designing a general intensive care unit in a walk-in virtual environment (VE) and examines how their work-related knowledge can be transferred to the design process of spaces. In this action research study, the design process was conducted by using virtual mock-ups, which were evaluated by multi-occupational groups in a walk-in VE. Nurses were the largest occupational group. Their work processes were under modification, since existing multi-patient rooms were being redesigned as single-patient rooms. The design of single-patient rooms was performed in three iterative cycles in the walk-in VE. The nurses could specify their requirements in the walk-in VE, and their suggestions were incorporated into the architectural design process. The nurses were satisfied with their role in the design process. Co-design with virtual mock-ups in walk-in VE is appropriate when designing new healthcare facilities and when the opinions of workers are important. Virtual mock-ups in walk-in VE can be used collaboratively, facilitating simultaneous feedback from multiple users. Virtual reality (VR) technology has evolved, and changes can be made rapidly and at a lower cost. Another advantage of VR is that it allows one to design larger spaces, thus providing larger layouts of facilities for evaluation.

This study examined how a vertical mobility obstacle, that is, mandatory stair climbing in walk-up residential buildings, may impact whether seniors go outdoors. We collected and examined 1,608 valid data records from 64 Chinese senior participants in Shanghai wearing Fitbit HR wristbands that tracked their mobility and physical activity for 31 consecutive days. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regressions were performed on the binary leaving-home-or-not probability by the level of vertical obstacles controlled for physical-demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, outdoor activity habits, and weather. Our observations revealed that each floor above ground level reduced the likelihood of outdoor trips by approximately one third per floor. After controlling for the physical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors of the participants as well as weather and holidays, we found that significantly fewer going-out incidents were also associated with more frequent outdoor activities within the community, especially in paved areas, but no associations were observed with self-reported visit frequencies to green spaces, senior centers within the community, or other places outside the community. This study offered the in situ observation that seniors' probability of leaving their homes is correlated with the degree of vertical circulation as a mobility barrier (i.e., the number of stairs between their living space and access to the outdoors), which may impact policy making for regulations concerning elevators in residential codes and renovations. ","179":"Using 3D design models, this study aims to better involve patients in the design of hospitals by investigating what physical environmental characteristics in hospital patient rooms are valued by patients. There is a plea for shared-decision-making and collaborative design processes with representatives from healthcare and the construction sector based on evidence and end users' perspectives. Existing research is hampered by poor conceptualization of environmental design factors, as these are differently operationalized between medical and technological sciences. Architects communicate through visuals, whereas medical professionals and researchers tend to communicate in words. By using 3D-modeling to research the relationship between health and well-being on the one hand, and the affordances the built environment offers, this knowledge gap can be better addressed. Two hundred four respondents, 60% patients and 40% medical professionals, engaged in discrete choice experiments visualizing a single patient room. A main finding is that patients and medical professionals consistently choose for hospital rooms with the highest amount of daylight access. What this study adds is that the orientation of the windows matters as well. Horizontal windows, allowing for a panoramic view, were twice as much chosen than were vertical windows. Another important finding concerns patients' preferences for an open door, suggesting patients prefer to stay \"connected\" to the outside world. This study is important as it shows, empirically, that patients may make different choices if in research the rooms are better conceptualized and thus visualized and if multiple design features are assessed as configuration rather than using a sequential, \"one-design-characteristic-after-another\" approach.","180":"Circumpolar nations are experiencing unprecedented environmental and public health policy challenges due to global climate change, exploitation of nonrenewable natural resources, the endangerment of myriad wildlife species, and growing sovereignty disputes. In a call to action, the Arctic states' health ministers recently signed a declaration identifying shared priorities for mutual international cooperation. Among agreed-upon collaborations, an enhancement of intercultural understanding and promotion of culturally appropriate healthcare delivery systems is to be of high priority going forward. In far north Canada, health policies perpetuated for generations upon indigenous communities have, traditionally, often had adverse consequences for the medically underserved inhabitants of these communities. This discussion addresses the cultural disconnect between the colonial era and current indigenous, decolonialist health and healing design strategies. In response, two architectural design case studies are presented that synthesize ecological site planning precepts with salutogenic architectural design attributes-a behavioral health and substance abuse residential treatment center and three elderhousing prototypes for construction in Canada's Northwest Territories. This conceptual synthesis is practicable, transferable, and adaptable to varied, extreme climatic conditions, as reflective of best practices in the delivery of healthcare facilities that express a synthesis of ecohumanist and salutogenic values and methodologies. The discussion concludes with a call for empathic, evidence-based collaboration and research that further examines the blending together of prefabricated off-site construction with on-site construction approaches.

Responding to the need for nonpharmacological behavioral interventions, VHA funded the first MSE for Veterans with dementia in 2010. The room incorporated LED color-changing lights, bubble tubes, vibroacoustic furniture, music, and aromatherapy, and the success of this patient-centered sensory room fueled national rollouts in 2013 and 2015. A qualitative interview approach was used. Thirty-two staff members participated from 12 of the 53 sites producing 21 individual interviews and 1 group interview with 11 participants. Results were analyzed by a team of eight researchers using the rapid qualitative inquiry method to identify common themes and major insights. Important insights emerged with regard to staff members' perceptions about the effectiveness of MSE therapy as well as barriers to uptake and suggested strategies for overcoming those barriers (e.g., empowering a champion, developing a clear maintenance plan). The findings from this research indicate MSEs are perceived as effective in improving behavior for Veterans with dementia and represent an innovation that has been well-diffused within the VHA, with great potential for future clinical applications.

Most hospitals are designed for highly specialized medical functions, which is often in conflict with the need to design the hospital facility to accommodate evolvement and change of functions over time. Architectural design strategies provide different approaches to the need to design for a specific medical program while planning for its future change. The study compares two hospital buildings with a very similar configuration and medical program but with significantly different architectural design strategies: One was designed for an unknown future medical function, and the second was designed for a specific medical function. The study analyses the two hospital buildings by their design strategy, planning, design process, and construction by phases and compares their change in practice over the last twelve years. The design strategy to fit a specific function limited the hospital affordance to make changes during the design process, construction, and occupancy phases. Systematic design of system separation for an unknown function, in contradiction to a \"tailor-made\" approach in the design for a specific function, was found to support a variety of changing medical programs. Architectural design strategies developed in an early stage of the design process has a major impact on the future evolution of the hospital facility. The different results between the two projects also demonstrate the greater influence of healthcare policies, hospital organization culture, and infrastructure funding models on the architecture and flexibility of hospitals. ","183":"The aim of this article is to provide a narrative overview of theories that are available in the published literature on wayfinding in interior environments. Wayfinding is an issue in healthcare facilities, and it has been documented that wayfinding problems have negative impacts on patients, visitors, caregivers' time, and the organization's bottom line. This issue can be more challenging for people with illness, low vision, cognitive disorders, and limited physical mobility. Wayfinding is a complex phenomenon depending on a variety of cognitive processes and behaviors. This article is a part of a broader literature review that searched for empirical studies on interior wayfinding. Four databases were systematically searched-PsychINFO, JSTOR, ProQuest, and EBSCO. A total of 81 articles satisfied all inclusion criteria for the broader study. Each article included in the broader study was reviewed to identify theory or theories, if any, that a study was founded on. After an in-depth review of the theories, the authors proposed four categories of theories relating to human wayfinding. The four classes and the specific theories in those are articulated in this article, including major changes during their evolution. The four classes of theories explain four facets of wayfinding: (1) theories of perception, (2) theories of spatial knowledge development, (3) theories of mental representation of spatial knowledge, and (4) theories of spatial cognition. Since wayfinding is essentially a cognitive\/problem-solving phenomenon, understanding the theoretical underpinnings of wayfinding may result in more meaningful and impactful design decisions.

There are few studies of eye movements when observing different style gardens, and how they are connected to the interpretation of the space, and physiological and psychological responses. Thirty subjects were recruited and their physiological and psychological responses to viewing the garden types were assessed using a heart-rate monitor and questionnaire. Eye movements while viewing projected slide images of the gardens were tracking using an eye-tracking monitor. A significant decrease in heart rate was observed when subjects were viewing the Japanese garden as opposed to viewing the herb garden. Mood was significantly improved in both gardens, but eye-gaze patterns differed. The Japanese garden elicited far more comments about expectations for the coming season; unlike the herb garden, it also induced memories of viewing other landscapes. The physiological and psychological responses to viewing gardens differs based on the quality of landscape design and the prior experience of viewers. ","186":"This study was designed to explore the associations between an ambient scent environment and residents' wellness in long-term care facilities. The number of older adults living in an institutional setting has been steadily but slowly increasing. Because of a higher chance of having psychological disorders among people living in institutional settings than people living in noninstitutional settings, providing a supportive institutional setting is critical to enhance their wellness. The theory of supportive design suggests healthcare facilities can lower people's stress levels via three conditions (i.e., perceived control, social support, and positive distractions). A single-blind and placebo-randomized controlled study investigated the impacts of ambient scent environment, as a positive distraction, on residents' depression levels. The recruited residents (N = 58) were randomly assigned into either the intervention group, which received a 1% dilution of lavender scent for 2 weeks nearby their bedside or the placebo group, which received a nonscent for 2 weeks. Their depression levels were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale. Based on the t tests, both intervention and placebo groups had improvement in depression, indicating a placebo effect of lavender scent. Further regression analyses explored the interaction effects of built environments (e.g., building, distance to a ventilation system, and square footage). However, no statistically significant impact of the built environment was found. Despite a placebo effect of ambient scent environment and nonsignificant built environment on depression, this study has valuable implications of being a positive distraction during the healing process as developed by the Theory of Supportive design. ","187":"This study investigated the level of acceptance in Singapore of the eight principles of design underpinning the Environmental Assessment Tool-High Care (EAT-HC), which is commonly used in Australia to evaluate environments for the care of people living with dementia. A secondary goal was to identify topics particularly relevant to the Singaporean context, which are not included in the Australian EAT-HC. This study was undertaken in preparation for the development of a Singaporean version of the Australian EAT-HC. Discussions from 23 focus groups involving 150 family caregivers, aged care staff, administrators, and architects were recorded and thematically analyzed to identify the characteristics of the principles underpinning the EAT-HC that are unlikely to be relevant in a Singaporean version and to identify additional topics required to tailor it to reflect the Singaporean culture. The thematic analysis was supplemented with quantitative data obtained through the use of simple Likert-type scales measuring the appropriateness of each principle in the Singaporean context. The principles of design that underpin the EAT-HC were highly accepted by participants and provided a framework for a systematic exploration of Singaporean residential care for people with dementia. Some topics of particular relevance to Singapore were identified. These can be subsumed by the principles without the need for the principles to be changed. The results support the use of the design principles underpinning the EAT-HC as the foundation of a tool for the evaluation of Singaporean dementia facilities. ","188":"This study proposes a flow mapping approach for surgical facilities that can be implemented by design teams as a component of case study tours. The provision of healthcare services involves simultaneous and closely coupled flows of people, objects, and information, and the efficiency of these flows is influenced by the spatial configuration of the buildings where these services are housed. Many architecture firms conduct case study tours to inform their design process. However, these tours often lack a structured way of documenting different flows and interpreting observations. A structured approach is needed during the design process to understand the impact of spatial configuration on healthcare flows. Site tours were conducted at four surgery centers to develop and test an evidence-based flow mapping approach. Idealized flows within surgical facilities were first identified from the literature, followed by the development of a data collection tool aimed at documenting these flows in each case study through a pre-assessment questionnaire, a physical assessment, and interviews with staff. The flow mapping tool kit was effective in allowing the design team to systematically understand the physical configuration of surgical flows across case studies. The tool also allowed the team to identify spatial configuration characteristics acting as barriers and facilitators to idealized flows. The flow mapping approach was able to provide structure for conducting these short tours more effectively via observations and staff inquiry, enabling design teams to draw more meaningful conclusions from case study tours and conduct comparisons between healthcare facilities visited. ","189":"This mixed-method study aimed to establish preliminary evidence for spatial and design features that can improve the experience and participation of Indigenous inpatients in healthcare. Disadvantaged across a range of health measures, a disproportionately high number of Indigenous people leave hospital without receiving appropriate medical care. Australian government policies to improve cultural safety of Indigenous patients have largely ignored physical settings and their potential to improve health outcomes. Despite increasing evidence on the potential of design to reduce patient stress, there is minimal research on cross-cultural design in health facilities, including for Indigenous Australians. A cross-sectional, area-based survey elicited design preferences of four healthcare settings from Indigenous participants (n = 602). On the screen-based survey, participants selected from paired images that indicated their preferences for room layout and features of inpatient rooms. Semistructured in-depth interviews (n = 55) explored meanings behind preferences. Participants showed majority preferences for the two-bed patient room, for a balcony rather than a window only, Indigenous art, and view of a park over an urban environment. Analysis of qualitative data shifted the focus from Ulrich's three supportive design components to cultural recognition, the desire for company of family members, and connection to life outdoors. Social and cultural factors were highly significant to patients for sense of control, family support, and positive distraction. In response, inpatient room size and type, views, access to outdoors and Indigenous art need to be considered in hospital design for Indigenous patients and families. ","190":"In a complex medical center environment, the occupants of newly built or renovated spaces expect everything to \"function almost perfectly\" immediately upon occupancy and for years to come. However, the reality is usually quite different. The need to remediate initial design deficiencies or problems not noted with simulated workflows may occur. In our intensive care unit (ICU), we were very committed to both short-term and long-term enhancements to improve the built and technological environments in order to correct design flaws and modernize the space to extend its operational life way beyond a decade. In this case study, we present all the improvements and their background in our 20-bed, adult medical-surgical ICU. This ICU was the recipient of the Society of Critical Care Medicine's 2009 ICU Design Award Citation. Our discussion addresses redesign and repurposing of ICU and support spaces to accommodate expanding clinical or entirely new programs, new regulations and mandates; upgrading of new technologies and informatics platforms; introducing new design initiatives; and addressing wear and tear and gaps in security and disaster management. These initiatives were all implemented while our ICU remained fully operational. Proposals that could not be implemented are also discussed. We believe this case study describing our experiences and real-life approaches to analyzing and solving challenges in a dynamic environment may offer great value to architects, designers, critical care providers, and hospital administrators whether they are involved in initial ICU design or participate in long-term ICU redesign or modernization.","191":"The public areas of the hospital built environment have hardly been investigated for their age-friendliness. This exploratory, multidisciplinary pilot study investigates the relationship between the physical environment and design of hospital spaces and older people's outpatient experience. Sixteen participants were recruited from a geriatric Outpatient Clinic at a metropolitan public hospital in Australia. Participants were engaged in a concurrent mixed-method approach, comprising a comprehensive geriatric survey, walking observation, semi-structured interview and an independent architectural audit. Several elements arising from the hospital environment were identified as facilitators and barriers for its utilization and intrinsically related to participants' physical capacity. Age-friendly hospital design needs to consider strategies to remove barriers for older adults of different capacities, thus promoting healthy aging. ","192":"This study empirically investigates the correlation between visibility and nurses and physicians' collaborative communication in emergency departments (EDs). The researchers hypothesized that higher visibility levels in EDs are associated with higher collaborative communication among nurses and physicians. The review of related literature addresses the role of communication in EDs, and more specifically, how visibility has been found to affect nurse and physician behavior in healthcare facilities. The visibility levels in four EDs within the same hospital system were quantitatively measured in this study. Also, the communication levels among medical staff were explored by two methods. Data collection included computerized floor plan analyses, observations, and surveys. The researchers found statistically significant relationships between several underlying dimensions of ED visibility and collaborative communication among the medical staff members. Understanding the role of visibility provides a critical design principle for future EDs. The enhancement of ED design helps nurses and physicians to benefit from supportive environments. ","193":"This study sought to investigate architectural and space design considerations for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anecdotal evidence suggests that urban design features could have a positive impact on the mental well-being of individuals suffering from PTSD. However, evidence-based architectural and space design guidelines for PTSD are largely absent. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 veterans diagnosed with PTSD to gain insights into their personal experiences with physical indoor and outdoor spaces, and to inquire about their needs and expectations for future architectural design. Transcripts were analyzed thematically. Architectural design features including windows, entrances and exits, walkways and hallways, open space, defensible space, and green space; interior design features including furnishings and color; and ambient features including light, air quality, and noise levels were identified as most influential design features. Our results underscore the first important step to developing comprehensive architectural and space design guidelines for veterans with PTSD. Work is in progress to solicit more feedback from veterans. ","194":"We propose a methodological framework to use immersive virtual environments (IVEs) in head-mounted displays for environmental design research. IVEs offer researchers with experimental control and realistic representations of environments with high levels of ecological validity. IVEs are also increasingly being used to visualize proposed designs. Despite these tremendous benefits, IVEs are underutilized in environmental design research. We are unaware of preexisting frameworks that synthesize the methodological decisions related to the use of IVEs to conduct environmental design research. We define the concepts necessary to conduct IVE research (virtual reality [VR], IVEs, ecological validity, visual realism, behavioral realism, and contextual realism). We also summarize the available study designs (correlational studies, experimental studies, and performance evaluations) and software systems used to create IVEs. We conclude with a conceptual framework that describes how research questions and study designs inform IVE selection and ecological validity. This framework is accompanied by a workflow that operationalizes the creation and use of IVEs in research. VR provides a robust and innovative research strategy for environmental design research because of its high degree of experimental control, rich data collection options, and opportunities for systematic evaluation of alternative design configurations. ","195":"The purpose of this study was to examine the factors impacting seating choices of care partners while conducting common tasks in an outpatient surgical center waiting room. Waiting rooms in healthcare environments have been previously studied to understand how factors such as aesthetics, privacy, comfort, and positive distractions impact user perception of quality of care. Although care partners of patients often spend long hours in the surgical waiting rooms, no studies have addressed users' seat type and location preferences in waiting areas. In this study, 92 participants made seat selections while performing scenario-based tasks in a virtual waiting area. A mixed-methods approach including a survey and semi-structured interviews was utilized to capture participants' feedback on how certain factors (e.g., visibility, accessibility, privacy, comfort, and aesthetic quality) impacted their choices. The optimal seat location and type in the waiting area varied depending on the type of task care partners were engaged in. While being able to sit with their loved one was the most important factor influencing seat selection during patient check-in, seat location was the most important factor in all other scenarios. The importance of factors such as seat comfort, seat type, visual and auditory privacy, and visibility to registration area varied across scenarios. However, the visual appearance of the seating remained equally important across all scenarios. The use of different scenarios allowed users to identify their preferences regarding seating within the context of their specific needs at different points in the waiting process.

It details the users' views regarding the existing signage and presents suggestions to improve the design and implementation of the signage systems. A questionnaire was used with 1,287 respondents. The results showed that almost all users had a positive opinion regarding the current signage. However, some of the users' answers and observed behaviors indicated that the majority tended to ignore the signs and preferred to ask staff for help. Additionally, when asked for suggestions, many of the respondents were able to point out existing problems that affected their wayfinding. Although the signage was generally evaluated as good, many of the users perceived a variety of problems and, as already mentioned, asked the staff for directions, which results in lost time and hidden costs for the institutions.","197":"","198":"In the schematic design phase of a new freestanding children's hospital, Simulation-based Hospital Design Testing (SbHDT) was used to evaluate the proposed design of 11 clinical areas. The purpose of this article is to describe the SbHDT process and how it can help identify and mitigate safety concerns during the facility design process. In the design of new healthcare facilities, the ability to mitigate risk in the preconstruction period is imperative. SbHDT in a full-scale cardboard mock-up can be used to proactively test the complex interface between people and the built environment. This study was a prospective investigation of SbHDT in the schematic design planning phase for a 400-bed freestanding children's hospital where frontline staff simulated episodes of care. Latent conditions related to design were identified through structured debriefing. Failure mode and effect analysis was used to categorize and prioritize simulation findings and was used by the architect team to inform design solutions. A second round of testing was conducted in order to validate design changes. A statistically significant reduction in criticality scores between Round 1 (n = 201, median = 16.14, SD = 5.8) and Round 2 (n = 201, median score of 7.68, SD = 5.26, p &lt; .001) was identified. Bivariate analysis also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in very high\/high criticality scores between Round 1 and Round 2. SbHDT in the schematic phase of design planning was effective in mitigating risk related to design prototypes through effective identification of latent conditions and validation of design changes.

The article shows how her famous Notes on Nursing is a positive treatment of the lessons learned, turning the sanitary defects, notably in ventilation, into chapters of the book. The importance of the pavilion model of hospital design is highlighted. There is coverage of the advances made by Semmelweis at the Vienna General Hospital. This is a purely historical study drawing on the extensive publications by Nightingale, augmented by her (massive) surviving correspondence and notes. The search for archival materials was done for the publication of the 16-volume Collected Works of Florence Nightingale, written by the author of this article.

The framework uses four dimensions that capture the experiential phenomena of users, such as visual relationships between specific sets of users\/targets, how the orientation of the seeing entity changes visibility patterns, and the unequal visibility levels of seeing and being seen. The framework particularly focuses on how the layout and the resulting patterns of visibility reflect and influence the user experience and organizational functions. By illustrating the similarities and differences of various models in the framework according to the dimensions, this article describes how various visibility analysis models, tools, and metrics can be applied to design and research.","204":"This research aimed to identify the extent to which physical features of two neurorehabilitation units appeared to support positive patient experience and recovery. Neurorehabilitation inpatient facilities must be focused on safety management and efficiency of care, as well as being supportive of the patient experience. While occupational safety and risk management is paramount, the supportive nature of the physical setting for inpatient neurorehabilitation following spinal cord injury or acquired brain injury is unclear. Structured observation of two physical environments using an adapted observational tool comprising 237 items across 8 area zones, and 3 major categories (patient safety, worker safety and efficiency, and holistic patient experience). Results indicated that across both neurorehabilitation settings, the built environment attended well to occupational safety, risk reduction, harm prevention and internal security (up to 87% in spinal injury unit [SIU] and 95% in brain injury unit [BIU] patient rooms), but with limited evidence of physical features to support psychosocial needs or promote positive user experiences (up to 30% in SIU and 45% in BIU patient rooms). The built environments observed appeared to be an underutilized resource for supporting positive psychosocial neurorehabilitation experiences (including complex behavior support) beyond hazard management.

However, the literature is diverse and provides no integrated system to identify nature scenes that provide most therapeutic benefit. The current study aimed to validate and extend results of a correlational study that found the Importance for Survival Scale (IFSS) useful for selecting generally preferred nature scenes with therapeutic potential. The correlational study that tested the usefulness of the IFSS and the current qualitative study were components of a larger mixed-methods study. For the current study, general community participants (N = 20 males, 20 females; mean age = 48 years) provided verbal responses to questions about thoughts and feelings associated with a selection of photographs of nature scenes. Data were analyzed using a content analysis approach. Themes and detailed descriptors associated with preference for, and emotional response to, most- and least-liked nature scenes were produced. A proportion of those themes is directly related to the construct of Importance for Survival (IFS), whereas other themes are better explained by alternative theoretical perspectives. Results uphold the IFSS as an effective tool for identifying generally preferred nature scenes with restorative potential, and provide information about the relative importance of IFSS subscales that may be used to further develop and refine the IFSS, as well as guide selection of restorative nature scenes. Results also provide fine-scaled descriptive information about preference for and emotional response to nature scenes. ","207":"Medical and nursing staff working in hospitals often experience exposure to extreme sound environments, and there is growing evidence of the negative impacts. Previous research highlighted various complexities regarding noise sources in hospitals; however, identifications of intrinsic noise categories that can reveal the complex mixture of existing hospital noise is still limited. The objective of this work was to identify intrinsic categories of the noise sources based on staff perceived annoyance and explore clear associations of these categorized noise sources with psychological perceptions. The staff perceptual responses regarding hospital noise were assessed by conducting surveys at the three pediatric and neonatal care units in two hospitals. Using principle component analysis (PCA), the psychological annoyance responses of 94 participants were used to derive the inherent structural patterns of the existing noise sources. The derived PCA categorization was validated on mixed-model analysis of variances, and employed on regression models to explore potential associations between the categorized noise factors and the staff's psychological perceptions. The results highlighted three intrinsic noise categories and their negative impacts on staff's psychological perceptions including work\/rest disturbance and noisiness. Taken as a whole, the findings better reveal problematic noise source categories and establish a framework for hospital noise control that is less source-specific and more broadly generalizable.","208":"The purpose of this article is to conceptually discuss moderator and mediator models in healthcare design studies. Healthcare outcomes are many times the result of meaningful interactions between multiple factors from different domains such as physical design, operations, culture, psychology, physiology, and social, among others. Simple multivariate models may not (a) capture these intricate relationships, (b) provide predictive precision, and (c) optimize arguments behind design decisions. A review of text books and publications on research methods was conducted, along with a review of completed research studies to identify appropriate examples for articulation. An analysis of a nonrandom sample of completed healthcare design studies demonstrates the potential benefits of developing and testing moderator and mediator models in healthcare design studies. Moderator and mediator models may help optimize multifaceted solutions that include simultaneous and parallel interventions in the physical, operational, cultural, psychological, physiological, social, and\/or other environments hypothesized to play a role in the outcome of interest.

Referring to biomedical ethics will provide a research logic and form a theoretical framework for healthcare designers to define patient autonomy, to master the conditions for promoting it, and to discover the potential of the environment. In modern society, it becomes the responsibility of healthcare architects to realize the design of \"benefit for patients.\" The goal of healthcare environment design and research is also gradually from a basic level of ensuring the physiological safety of patients to achieving a higher level of respecting patients and helping realize their self-realization. However, how to express respect to patients in the healthcare environment is ambiguous. In order to break through the limitation of architectural specialty, we propose to introduce biomedical ethics. Under this major premise, this article will discuss from the perspective of respect for autonomy (RA). This article combines the definition of autonomy and the discussion of the medical and nursing practice to summarize and propose the themes about RA. It draws on the top-down deductive logic of biomedical ethics from theory to application and applies the three-condition theory of Beauchamp and Childress to deduce the role of the healthcare environment on patient autonomy in each theme. Introducing biomedical ethics into the study of environmental design provides a more theoretical and systematic way of thinking about the role of the healthcare environment.

Progress requires the application of the most recent knowledge and technology. When it comes to the design and construction of healthcare facilities, the latest knowledge comes in the form of EBD research. EBD is the process of basing decisions about the built environment on credible research to achieve the best possible outcomes. The desired outcomes of EBD recommendations include improvements to enhance user control. User control factors include the individual control over bed position, air temperature, lights, sound, and natural light. A list of recommendations from existing EBD literature related to user controls was compiled. Construction documents from 30 recent healthcare facility renovation projects across the United States were obtained and analyzed. Implementation levels for the EBD categories of user controls were reported. The findings indicate relatively extensive industry use of EBD principles relating to user control of temperature, lights, and natural lighting. The findings indicate that EBD recommendations related to user controls are being adopted in practice at consistently high levels. These findings also reveal that there are still areas of potential improvement which could inform those who influence or determine building design, codes, standards, and guidelines. The results are helpful to owners, designers, and contractors by providing a glimpse into how well the industry is recognizing and implementing known best practices.

Quantitative methods are rarely employed to explore factors affecting planning and opinions on the design of ADCCs from administrators' perspective. Stratified sampling was used to collect data from managers of ADCCs in Taiwan. A mixed-method approach with an analytic hierarchy process was used to quantify the relative importance of factors affecting location and building type selections. Participants responded to open-ended interview questions followed by focus group interviews to examine the key points for spatial layout and interior design. The managers deemed support and attitudes from local residents (group weight = .208) and authorities (group weight = .187) as their first two critical location selection criteria. Regarding their opinions on the conditions of building type, those that prioritized the products and technologies of facility design were deemed the most critical (group weight = .193), followed by those that valued daylight quality (group weight = .161).

An optimal hospital environment (the \"healing environment\") can enhance patients' postoperative recovery and shorten length of stay. However, insights lack into patients' lived environmental needs for optimal healing after surgery and how these needs are being met. A qualitative study was conducted between August 2016 and August 2017 with 21 patients who underwent elective major abdominal surgery in a Dutch university hospital. Data were collected through context-mapping exercises and interviews to capture patients' lived experiences and explore the meaning of these experiences. Data were systematically analyzed according to the principles of thematic content analysis. Three themes were identified. First, participants want a sense of control over their treatment, ambient features, privacy, nutrition, and help requests. Participants described the need for positive distractions: personalizing the room, connecting with the external environment, and the ability to undertake activities. Finally, participants expressed the importance of functional, practical, and emotional support from professionals, peers, and relatives. According to participants, the hospital environment often does not meet their healing needs while being hospitalized. The hospital environment often does not meet patients' needs. Needs fulfillment can be improved by practical adjustments to the physical and interpersonal environment and considering patient's individual preferences and changing needs during recovery. Patient narratives, pictures, and drawings are valuable sources for hospital managers in their efforts to design evidence-based environments that anticipate to patient-specific needs for achieving early recovery.

We conducted a systematic review, searching 10 databases in 2016 and 2017 for published research from their inception dates, on how birthing room design influences maternal and neonate physical and emotional outcomes, using a protocol agreed a priori. The quality of selected studies was assessed, and data were extracted independently by pairs of authors and described in a narrative analysis. In total, 3,373 records were identified and screened by title and abstract; 2,063 were excluded and the full text of 278 assessed for analysis. Another 241 were excluded, leaving 15 articles presenting qualitative and quantitative data from six different countries on four continents. The results of the analysis reveal four prominent physical themes in birthing rooms that positively influence on maternal and neonate physical and emotional outcomes: (1) means of distraction, comfort, and relaxation; (2) raising the birthing room temperature; (3) features of familiarity; and (4) diminishing a technocratic environment.

Studies indicate that patients' phenomenological experiences of the built environment characteristics of healthcare buildings can impact their healing and well-being. It follows that understanding the healing effects of landscape and architecture can inform the design of healthcare settings for increased health benefits. This method comprises five search stages: (1) research question is formed; (2) key words, search terms, and search strategy are identified; (3) databases are searched, and papers are assessed via inclusion and exclusion criteria; (4) information of the selected articles is extracted and summarized; and (5) key findings are interpreted and reported via comparative tabulation. One hundred seventy-three papers were found during the first search stage. After screening and evaluating for relevance and quality, 13 articles were selected for study. Analysis indicates that the built environment characteristics of pediatric healthcare environments that have healing benefits include access to nature, music, art and natural light, reduced crowding, reduced noise, and soft, cyclical, and user-controlled artificial lighting. While it is important to understand the design variables that influence pediatric healthcare, it is also necessary to contextualize them and to distinguish these variables from each other and appreciate their interaction. In other words, a more rounded understanding of these variables is required via research so that their individual and combined impacts are reflected in holistic design recommendations. ","215":"Waiting areas in healthcare settings play an important role in reassuring or potentially further distressing service users. The effects of the designed environment on mental health service users specifically are regarded by health professionals as having a considerable influence on treatment outcomes, experiences, and perceptions of care. The purpose of this article is to explore service user and practicing therapist perspectives of waiting areas in mental health service settings and how the design of these spaces affects anxiety levels, comfort, therapeutic relationships, outcomes, and perceptions of care. The methodology for this exploratory phenomenological study was developed in order to preserve the integrity of participant voices in the essences of experiences, during explorations of their encounters with therapeutic waiting areas. Fieldwork undertaken by the author involved a series of focused in-depth interviews with service users of mental health services and practicing therapists, counselors, and psychologists. Key themes identified through data analysis include (1) space acting as symbolism, (2) interpersonal relations which are threatening, and (3) sensory modulation. Design implications in relation to each theme are presented. This study uncovered a set of findings in relation to symbolic content inferred by spatial design aspects and the ways in which design can afford, or mitigate, development of interpersonal agencies, psychological safety, and negative stigmas. Future transdisciplinary research directions are suggested, including (1) examination of other relationships, beyond the service user-therapist dyad, which may influence waiting area experiences and (2) examination of the applicability of design suggestions to different contexts. ","216":"A positive distraction is a significant environmental feature that introduces positive feelings by diverting attention from stress or anxious thoughts. Existing research has deemed the application of positive distractions in pediatric environments to be significant. This study investigated the essential positive distractions and the associated health benefits. The aims of this study were to validate and extend evidence on positive distractions and play opportunities in the design of the public spaces in pediatric healthcare environments, translate existing evidence into design suggestions, and identify research gaps in this realm. A four-phased literature review method was employed in the study, including literature search, literature screening and selection, literature appraisal, and thematic analysis and in-depth discussion. Eventually, 27 peer-reviewed publications were reviewed and discussed in detail. The gathered materials were grouped into six themes of positive distractions: (1) art and environmental aesthetics, (2) spatial arrangement and atrium, (3) considerations of socialization patterns, (4) play and interactive technologies, (5) sound and lighting interventions, and (6) access to nature. The research indicated that positive distractions in the pediatric healthcare environment provide a series of health benefits for patients, including improved behavioral and emotional well-being, reduced stress and anxiety, enhanced healthcare experience and satisfaction, and facilitated medical procedures and recovery. Yet significant research gaps emerged between positive distractions and play in garden spaces and spatial design to accommodate interactive technology and socialization in the public areas of pediatric healthcare environments. This study organized the understanding on the components of supportive environments and its outcomes for pediatric healthcare design. ","217":"This article proposes and demonstrates a design anthropological approach to hospital design and architecture and engages this approach to advance recent discussions of the question of designing for staff breaks. We respond to calls for attention to sensory and experiential dimensions of hospital architecture and design through social science approaches and to research into the sensory environments for staff breaks. Design anthropology enables us to surface the experiential and unspoken knowledge and practice of hospital staff, which is inaccessible through conventional consultations, quantitative post-occupancy evaluation surveys, or traditional interviews. We draw on ethnographic research into the everyday experience, improvisatory activity, and imagined futures of staff working in the psychiatric department of a large new architecturally designed hospital in Australia. We argue that while the sensory aspects of hospital design conventionally cited-such as light and green areas-are relevant, attention to staff priorities that emerge in practice reveals that well-being is contingent on other qualities and resources. This suggests a refocus, away from the idea that environments impact on staff to create well-being, to understanding how staff improvise to create environments of well-being. We outline the implications of this research for an agenda for design for well-being in which architects and designers are often constrained by generic design briefs to argue for a shift in policy that attends more deeply to staff as future users of hospital designs. ","218":"Focusing on environmental factors important to facility-based senior living, this research intends to identify cross-national similarities and differences in perspective on elderly care between senior-living professionals in the United States and China. American models of senior-living facility design have been introduced in China. In social and cultural context, environmental factors important to facility-based senior living are expected to be different by nation and need to be clarified. Questionnaire data were collected from 188 staff members working in senior-living facilities in the United States and China. Seven factors summarized through literature review were investigated. The frequencies of each factor selected by the participants as one of the three most important factors were ranked. The influence of personal and social factors on environmental perception was analyzed using analysis of variance tests. Common area and cross-facility home-like decoration were similarly valued by both groups as two of the three most important factors. Residential room was valued more in the United States whereas natural lighting was valued more in China. Chinese participants with more work experience valued building layout more. Amenities were valued less than expected in both countries. Environmental factors important to facility-based senior living are different between countries. American models of senior-living facility design should be adjusted for use in China. There is much to be gained from investigating the similarities and differences in perspective on elderly care. ","219":"We aimed to examine the nature and extent of theory application in studies of built environment attributes and impact on adults in healthcare facilities. Many varied theories are described when providing the rationale for research into built environments in healthcare. Uncertainty exists around the right theory to frame a research question, alignment with measurement tools, and whether healthcare setting makes a difference. This poses challenges to researchers seeking to build the evidence base for built environment design that benefits patients and staff. Our multidisciplinary review team scoped the literature to determine how theories are used to inform research investigating the impact of the built environment of healthcare on adults. When researchers recorded theory at development of the study question, in data collection, and in data analysis\/interpretation, we called this explicitly theory-based application. Synthesis occurred using a narrative approach. Overall, we found 17 diverse theories named in studies. Explicitly theory-based use occurred with eight theories, comprising 47% of all theories used. Five theories were named more frequently in studies out of all theories identified. In 20% of studies, theory was not used explicitly during the research inquiry. We argue that researchers must continue to strive toward explicit use of theories, similar to development of other health interventions that employ multifactorial components.","220":"The present study aims to contribute to current knowledge about nurses' perceived importance of lighting in patient rooms and to compare these perceptions across different ages, work shifts, (day and night), and environments of care (traditional and contemporary). Creating an environment of care in patient rooms that successfully balances energy efficiency concerns with the holistic needs of patients, families, and caregivers poses a major challenge for future lighting systems. This study adds to a growing evidence base on the effects of lighting on nurses' job performance, job satisfaction, and overall perceptions of the environment. Survey responses from 138 participants working in medical-surgical units in four hospitals were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach, with three of the hospitals having lighting systems characterized as providing a traditional environment of care (TEC) and the other hospital having lighting systems characterized as providing a contemporary environment of care (CEC). No significant differences were found based on age or work shift, but several significant differences were found between participants working in the hospital with a CEC and those working in hospitals with a TEC. Participants from the hospital with a CEC lighting system consistently reported higher lighting quality, fewer patient complaints, and less need for supplemental lighting than the participants from the three hospitals with TEC lighting systems. The results of this study provide evidence that innovative lighting approaches and technologies are worth considering as an investment by hospital administrators looking to improve perceptions of the patient room environment.

The article outlines the methodological criteria originally established for the Delphi method, as well as commonly accepted modifications, to advance guidance for evidence-based built environment considerations. Increasingly used in healthcare research, the Delphi method is a process for gaining consensus through controlled feedback from a panel-a group made up of experts or individuals knowledgeable on the subject. The method is often used where there is limited or conflicting evidence, where participants may be geographically dispersed, and where anonymity is desired to control for dominant individuals. The Delphi method consists of panel selection, development of content surveys, and iterative stages of anonymous responses to gain consensus. Panelists receive feedback after each round in the form of a statistical representation of the overall group's response. The goal of multiple iterations in the Delphi method is to reduce the range of responses and gain expert consensus, which is often seen as more credible than conjecture or individual opinion. With a geographic diversity of healthcare design expertise, and with so many aspects of healthcare design lacking a robust body of supporting empirical research, the Delphi method is well-suited to developing evidence-based design recommendations and considerations for healthcare built environments.

A contemporary healing environment may be recognized by the quality of an indoor environment in positively influencing patients' psychological comfort and supporting their recovery. Post-occupancy evaluations were conducted in Shar General Hospital and Faruk Medical City wards. A 43-item questionnaire was distributed to 312 patients, doctors, and nurses to gather their perspectives. In total, 175 valid questionnaires were retrieved. The results show that the quality of the indoor environments met patients' psychological needs and expectations, and as a result, they were generally satisfied with the indoor healing environments. The findings from the patient and medical staff surveys suggest three essential factors in creating a healing environment, which are (1) Interior appearance, (2) Privacy, and (3) Comfort and control. Significant negative correlations of some demographic characteristics, such as educational attainment and age, with patient satisfaction were observed. This study shows that exploring patients' and medical staff's experiences can reveal factors that positively influence patients' satisfaction levels, which may vary depending on their sociocultural perspectives and personal characteristics. Additionally, the findings emphasize the role of the tested factors in increasing patients' satisfaction levels, optimizing healing environments, and informing design decisions. ","227":"This mixed-methods study delivers empirical evidence on the influence of visibility on healthcare teamwork in Emergency Departments (EDs). This study researchers hypothesized that with changes of visibility in EDs, teamwork among medical staff members will be impacted. Prior research results suggest that visibility can influence health-setting efficacy. Teamwork is one of the components of each healthcare system that can be supported by environmental design. Visibility in four subject sites from the same healthcare system was objectively measured by morphology plan analyses. Teamwork among medical staff members was the behavioral variable of interest and explored through field observations, interviews, and surveys. The qualitative outcomes demonstrated that teamwork can be enhanced by improved visibility, while the quantitative findings supported the idea that some specific measures of visibility were correlated with teamwork. This study provides a model for future research on the association between healthcare staff behavior and ED plan configuration. The enhancement of ED design, considering the significance of visibility, enhances the perceptions of nurses and physicians in terms of teamwork. ","228":"The objective of this empirical research is to compare nurses' operational workflow and nurses' and patients' satisfactions of two different infusion center designs. One center has a traditional open bay design and the other has semi-private bays. This study also intends to gather baseline data to compare to a future post-occupancy evaluation of a new infusion center where the two existing centers will be combined. The increasing number of patients with cancer diagnosis who refer to infusion centers highlights the importance of design of these centers. The mixed-method approach of this study involves shadowing nurses and surveying nurses and patients. Data collection captured nurses' activities, activity durations, and nurses' and patients' satisfaction with the design of clinics. Comparison of shadowing data indicated that although the infusion centers have different layouts, there are no significant differences in the activities or time spent by nurses in different areas among the centers. Staff, however, have different satisfaction levels with visual and speech privacy, ability to concentrate without distraction, collaboration with other staff, and the process of medication delivery. Patients also had slightly different satisfaction levels with their ability to communicate with staff and design of bays. This research sheds light on operational workflows and satisfaction of staff and patients in two different infusion center design. Considering the limited studies on these settings, this study serves as baseline data to compare to other studies on cancer infusion centers and addresses issues of benchmarking and staff and patient satisfaction. ","229":"This study focused on long-term care (LTC) settings for individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI). The goals were (1) to assess the impact of facility configuration on social interactions between residents and staff and (2) obtain a better understanding of staff and resident perceptions of the built environment. A few studies have explored the relationship between the built environment and social interaction in LTC facilities, but there is little empirical data about ABI-specific LTC facilities. A literature review was conducted on the impact of the built environment on the LTC of brain injury survivors. Via a questionnaire, staff and residents in two settings, one with patient rooms off corridors and the other with patient rooms surrounding a common space, rated the effectiveness of the built environment in promoting social interaction. Behavioral observation was conducted on 18 residents for a duration of 4 hr per resident. Via questionnaires, staff rated the corridor facility as more effective in promoting social interaction, but no significant differences were found between the assessments of the two resident populations. Contrary to staff questionnaire results, residents in the open configuration facility exhibited more social behaviors. Building configuration may impact social interaction between staff and residents in ABI-specific LTC facilities and potentially impact staff and resident quality of life. However, configuration cannot be viewed in a vacuum; residents' physical and mental limitations, demographic information, and staff engagement must be also considered. ","230":"This article examines how visual exposure to patients predicts patient-related communication among staff members. Communication among healthcare professionals private from patients, or backstage communication, is critical for staff teamwork and patient care. While patients and visitors are a core group of users in healthcare settings, not much attention has been given to how patients' presence impacts staff communication. Furthermore, many healthcare facilities provide team spaces for improved staff teamwork, but the privacy levels of team areas significantly vary. This article presents an empirical study of four team-based primary care clinics where staff communication and teamwork are important. Visual exposure levels of the clinics were analyzed, and their relationships to staff members' concerns for having backstage communication, including preferred and nonpreferred locations for backstage communication, were investigated. Staff members in clinics with less visual exposure to patients reported lower concerns about having backstage communication. Staff members preferred talking in team areas that were visually less exposed to patients in the clinic, but, within team areas, the level of visual exposure did not matter. On the other hand, staff members did not prefer talking in visually exposed areas such as corridors in the clinic and visually exposed areas within team spaces. Staff members preferred talking in team areas, and they did not prefer talking in visually exposed areas. These findings identified visually exposed team areas as a potentially uncomfortable environment, with a lack of agreement between staff members' preferences toward where they had patient-related communication.

Nurses are extremely important for the quality of healthcare. The literature suggests that visibility and proximity have a substantial impact on the delivery of care and staff experience. However, few studies have empirically examined nursing units in China. Questionnaire surveys, observations, and simulations of medication administration tasks were employed. Visibility and proximity influenced communication patterns, perceptions of privacy, and efficiency. The type of wall in the medication room could impact nurses' perception of privacy and efficiency. A partial glass wall in the medication room could achieve balance between privacy and visibility. A medication room that is adjacent to and is easily accessed from the nurse station (NS) could provide efficient communication and efficient work. The partition type between the NS and the doctor's office and the layout of the medication room could impact communication patterns. The relative position of the NS, medication room, and disposal room could influence the flow of medication administration tasks, and a geographically contiguous spatial layout could enhance work efficiency. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge on the impact of visibility and proximity on nurses' communication patterns, perception of privacy, and efficiency. Recommendations to improve the design of double-corridor nursing units are also provided.

Healing environments in healthcare settings can promote patients' healing processes, outcomes, and psychological well-being. The AHR was designed as a healing environment for stroke patients and has been previously evaluated in laboratory settings. This study was the first to evaluate it in its intended context-a stroke rehabilitation unit. The UX of 10 patients residing in the AHR and 15 patients residing in SPRs were collected via structured interviews with a set of open-ended questions and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. The AHR design features (orientation screen, skylight, and nature view) were rated positively by most patients. The skylight emerged as the least favorable. Responses to open-ended questions revealed that UX may be further improved if patients have more control over some of the settings (e.g., light intensity and nature views), and if the system allowed for more stimulation for patients at later stages of their recovery. Additionally, the results suggest that patients in the AHR have better UX than patients in the SPRs. The AHR has the potential to improve UX in the stroke rehabilitation unit. Patient feedback can be used to refine the AHR before carrying out clinical trials to assess the effect of the AHR on patient outcomes (e.g., sleep, mood, and length of stay) and stroke recovery.

The field of evidence-based design has made progress in systematically investigating relationships between healthcare facility design and a range of human outcomes. Yet healthcare facility evaluation is not typically included in the scope of building contracts. Lack of clear responsibility for evaluation and limited funding have been long-term barriers that the industry has yet to overcome. Firms engaged in design research at Parkland Hospital agreed with hospital representatives to collaborate on an integrated facility evaluation. Each participating entity contributed resources toward the effort. To formalize shared goals and priorities, the group developed a Research Coalition Charter. Goals included streamlining evaluation efforts to minimize burden on the hospital, leveraging multiple expertise areas to vet research aims and approaches, contributing knowledge to inform healthcare design, and innovating a model for multi-firm collaboration. The Coalition also developed guidelines for sharing data and disseminating research findings. To date, the Research Coalition has achieved key milestones including institutional review board exemption, data use and research collaboration agreements, and data collection. The research aims encompass patient and staff outcomes hypothesized to improve in the new facility. Both primary and secondary data are being analyzed to test the hypotheses. Publications of findings are forthcoming. Collaborative research among competitors may be a viable approach to realizing evaluation that is critical to learning for healthcare facility decision makers and design practitioners.","235":"To compare the impact of single-bed versus multibed room intensive care units (ICU) architectural designs on the stress and burnout of ICU staff and on the stress and satisfaction of family visitors. There are countless architectural variations among ICUs, but all involve single-bed or multibed rooms. Although it is well known that ICU design affects important patient outcomes, the effect of ICU design on family and staff has been insufficiently studied. Among ICU staff and family visitors, stress was evaluated with Lipp's Inventory of Stress Symptoms. ICU staff burnout was evaluated with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Family visitor satisfaction was evaluated with Molter's Critical Care Family Needs Inventory. Among 156 ICU professionals who were interviewed, similar burnout rates were observed between ICU staff who worked single-bed versus multibed rooms. However, stress reported by ICU staff within the previous 24 hr was higher among the ICU staff who worked in single-bed rooms (14.3% vs. 4.7%, p = .04). Among 176 family visitors who were interviewed, a similar level of stress was reported by family members who visited patients in single-bed or multibed rooms. However, the satisfaction of family members visiting patients in single-bed rooms was higher (96.0% vs. 84.6%, p = .02). Single-bed ICU design was associated with greater satisfaction of family visitors yet with higher levels of stress for ICU staff.

To understand how they set these goals, this research explored how \"user group\" participants from diverse professional discipline backgrounds define the concepts of \"design quality\" and \"project success,\" and their connection on a healthcare facility design project. User group consultation is often time-consuming, frustrating, and expensive. Rarely are design quality or project success clearly defined, nor is the connection between them communicated well either in the literature or by project clients. Using an online survey, respondents were asked to rank frameworks of components for design quality and project success in order of importance and to indicate how they believed their project clients would assess the same items. They were asked about the connection between the terms, and how well each was achieved on their healthcare projects, both from their personal and their client's point of view. Design quality and project success were personally valued highly by respondents, with a strong connection seen between the concepts. By contrast, respondents perceived their clients saw the connection as less important. Functionality was essential to all, especially clinicians, but designers and other consultants demonstrated a broader perspective on all design outcomes. Healthcare designers should take the lead on project teams in defining design quality and its connection to project success as part of setting clear goals and objectives for more effective user group consultation.

The anticipated functions and an estimate of the space required are generally provided in a project program or project brief. The programming consultant, often part of the architect's team, will calculate the physical area (square feet or square meters) required to perform the desired functions based on an understanding of demographics in the service area, services offered, the volumes of service required, and a historical understanding of space required to perform those services. Hospitals and hospital designs in North America have been changing. Plans must now address far higher percentages of outpatient care, accommodate new equipment modalities, and provide space to account for family presence in patient rooms. A study was undertaken to better understand whether the allocation of space in recently constructed hospital projects is different from the amounts of area devoted to various departments and functions in older projects. In order to assure measurement consistency, a measurement methodology was developed and is reported elsewhere. Thirty-six recently constructed hospitals were measured. The results provide new information about the allocation of space for nondepartmental functions within the overall building gross calculation. Many of the departmental space allocations fell within an expected range.

The authors introduce a modified version of the interactive sociotechnical analysis (ISTA) model to serve as the academic foundation for the Dress Rehearsal concept. Healthcare organizations that build new medical facilities must ensure the space is ready to use and that all staff, who will deliver and support patient care, are sufficiently trained. Currently, no standardized approach exists to prepare staff on an interdisciplinary level, to work in their new environment. There are multiple articles highlighting a single hospital or department using simulations before opening, but there is a lack of literature from an aggregate perspective. The Dress Rehearsal method is examined by drawing from the author's combined experience of conducting and evaluating hundreds of Dress Rehearsals across North America. Best practices to plan, prepare, and execute events will be reviewed. Evaluations collected after each event present a positive impact related to staff feeling prepared to provide safe care in the new environment, with increased satisfaction after subsequent Dress Rehearsals. A standardized approach to ensure staff feel confident and safe to move into their new healthcare environment should be a top priority for healthcare leadership.

There is minimal research on design for MBH and no published research using mockups to evaluate a MBH design proposal. To address this gap, an interdisciplinary team developed an ideal Patient-Centered MBH Patient Room, which was built as a mockup at a Veterans Administration (VA) facility and evaluated by patients and staff in situ. The mock-up was evaluated using a structured mixed methods process that incorporates feedback using Feedback Forms and facilitated Listening Sessions. Our two primary hypotheses were that the design, as represented by the mock-up, would be positively evaluated and that there would be a difference between staff and patient perceptions, with patients rating the design higher than staff. Quantitative analysis confirmed our hypotheses, revealing an overall positive response, with a difference between patients and staff. Contrary to hypothesis, staff consistently rated the design higher than patients. Qualitative analysis found mixed reception of the design and three primary themes: safety, homeyness\/deinstitutionalization, and positive distraction\/nature. Physical mock-ups may be an effective tool for evaluation of a proposed design; however, staff perceptions of the environment may differ from those of patients. One drawback of using a physical high-fidelity mock-up is the expectation that the mock-up perfectly represents the proposed design. With this project, even small unfinished details were distracting to the participants and may have negatively affected the evaluation. ","245":"The objective of the study was to identify current practices utilized by contractors in healthcare renovation projects. Renovation in healthcare facilities comprises nearly half of all healthcare construction. Since a complete shutdown of the healthcare facility during renovation is typically not feasible, efforts must be taken to isolate ongoing functions of the hospital from activities in the construction zone. There are numerous documented cases of morbidity and mortality related to construction activities in the hospital. Hence, guidelines recommend negative pressurization of the construction zone to prevent the migration of dust and potential pathogenic agents into the functioning zone. To accomplish the paper objective, a questionnaire was developed to address pressurization strategies, the use of backup systems and anterooms, and workforce training for healthcare projects. One hundred twenty-nine project managers and superintendents from top healthcare construction companies in the United States participated in the study. Results show that owners influence pressurization strategy, but contractors typically assume a primary role in establishing pressurization levels, monitoring conformance, and training construction personnel. However, without solid evidence of effectiveness, pressurization levels often vary from Center for Disease Control standards. Further research is needed to establish evidence-based practices and to develop training modules for construction crews to support these best practices.

","246":"The objectives of the research described in this article focus on an understanding of factors that influence creativity in healthcare design. Two areas of emphasis include the personality strengths of successful healthcare architects and elements of the current project delivery process. As part of the research, 48 healthcare architects participated in a battery of personality and creativity tests including Myers\/Briggs, The Big Five, the Remote Associates Test (RAT), and an architectural creativity test. Results of the test point to strong \"openness\" for new ideas, particularly with the designers sampled. As a group, respondents scored low in \"narcistic\" bias (indicating emotional stability) and did not score high in verbal creativity. Compared to earlier studies of creative architects, the sample group included significantly fewer \"perceiver\" (Myers\/Briggs), associated with a high level of curiosity. A second interesting finding was a significant difference between younger and older architects in the architectural creativity test. One possible hypothesis is the experience of the older architects. A second, and potentially more alarming, hypothesis is that technological disruptions are interfering with the ability to stimulate divergent thinking, particularly in the younger generation raised with smart phones and other network tools. Creativity in healthcare architecture demonstrates the case for domain-specific experience and skills along with creative input from other knowledge domains. The ability to establish group creativity may be inhibited by pressures to condense project time lines and not fully implement lean and other process strategies for exploring alternative solutions. Effective participation in group creativity tasks is particularly important for the complex world of healthcare design.","247":"Designing or renovating a physical environment for healthcare is a complex process and is critical for both the staff and the patients who rely on the environment to support and facilitate patient care. Conducting a simulation-based mock-up evaluation as part of the design process can enhance patient safety, staff efficiency, as well as user experience, and can yield financial returns. A large urban tertiary care center located in Vancouver, Canada followed a framework to evaluate the proposed design template for 28 universal operating rooms (ORs) included within the OR Renewal Project scope. Simulation scenarios were enacted by nursing staff, surgeons, anesthesiologists, residents, radiology techs, and anesthesia assistants. Video and debriefing data were used to conduct link analyses, as well as analyses of observed behaviors including congestions and bumps to generate recommendations for evidence-based design changes that were presented to the project team. Recommendations incorporated into the design included relocating doors, booms, equipment, and supplies, as well as reconfigurations to workstations. These recommendations were also incorporated into the mock-up and retested to iteratively develop and evaluate the design. Findings suggest that incorporating the recommended design changes resulted in better room utilization, decreased congestion, and enhanced access to equipment.","248":"This research investigated medical\/surgical (Med\/Surg) patient room design to accommodate the needs of hospital staff, while at the same time accommodating the needs of patients and their visitors. Designing hospital patient rooms that provide a comfortable healing experience for patients, while at the same time meeting the needs of the hospital staff, is a challenging process. Prior research has shown that many hospital patient room designs adversely affect the ability of hospital staff to perform their tasks effectively, efficiently, and safely. Twenty-seven design sessions were conducted in which 104 participants, representing 24 different occupations, worked in small mixed occupational groups to design an ideal single patient Med\/Surg patient room to fit their collective needs using a full-scale mock-up. During analysis, the investigators reduced the resulting 27 room designs to 5 hybrid designs that were sequentially reviewed by patients and visitors and by staff to address design conflicts.

Traditional ICUs differ from operating rooms (ORs) in several ways including air changes per hour (ACH) and pressurization. Increased ACH and positive pressurization of ORs intend to provide more aseptic environments for surgery. Development of procedure ready ICUs that transition through unoccupied, occupied, and procedure modes is one solution to improve environmental quality when performing surgery in ICUs. This study assessed the efficacy of two airflow control systems, variable air volume (VAV) and Venturi control, in preventing contaminants from entering ICU from adjacent corridors. Controlled contaminants, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and baker's yeast (CFU\/m3), were released in the corridor adjacent to the ICU. SF6 and CFU\/m3 were detected inside the ICU at the patient bed during a dynamic simulation of code blue event. VAV and Venturi were compared as they cycled the room through unoccupied, occupied, and procedure modes. VAV and Venturi showed significantly fewer CFU\/m3 at the patient bed than corridor point of release (p &lt; .05). Although not significant, Venturi cultured 14% fewer CFU\/m3 than VAV at the patient bed. There was less SF6 detected at the patient bed with VAV and Venturi (p &lt; .05). There was less SF6 detected at the patient bed with Venturi compared to VAV (p &lt; .05). Venturi transitioned between modes faster than VAV (p &lt; .05).

A scoping review was conducted using database searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane for articles published up to July 2018. The bibliography of the included articles were manually searched for published books. This review includes 137 peer-reviewed articles and research-based books from 27 countries. A conceptual framework was developed to identify five themes that conceptualize the NE in healthcare: (1) definitions of the NE in healthcare, (2) processes of the NE in healthcare, (3) usages of the NE in healthcare, (4) opinions about the NE in healthcare, and (5) NE's impacts on health and work outcomes in healthcare. These themes are filtered by the NE's physical and programmatic designs; changes in one affect the others. Definitions of the NE are described as human-made space, located in the indoors and outdoors, containing elements of nature and designed with the purpose to positively influence humans. Processes are described as the participatory approach in NE's development and its therapeutic goals. Usages are categorized into nature contact, frequency of usage, and accessibility. Opinions are accounted for by perceptions, preference, and satisfaction. Outcomes are related to physical health, mental health and well-being and work.

An online questionnaire was sent to EDs' caregivers nationwide asking them to rate the effectiveness of nine physical design strategies, discussed in the literature, to improve caregivers' performance and patient flow during MCIs. Assessed strategies were about providing expandable departments and care areas, alternate care facilities for the least sick to maximize care areas for critical patients, care areas from nonemergency units, increased number of decontamination units, dedicated isolation units, within-hospital and close emergency operation centers, and within-hospital media areas. All suggested strategies were rated as effective. The most effective and agreed-upon solution was identified as maximizing the care area for critical patients by establishing an alternate care facility with separate entrance and exit doors from the emergency department for the least critical patients. The least effective and agreed-upon strategy was identified as locating a media unit within the hospital outside of the ED.

While able to provide valuable subjective insights, these approaches are less effective in making objective comparisons between multiple designs alternatives. A repeated measures study was conducted with nursing faculty. User feedback was captured through surveys, interviews, and the VR platform. The survey, interview, and the objective VR data converged in terms of identifying the highest performing design option. Survey data showed that Room 2 performed best in terms of perceived physical access to supplies, unobstructed movement, and availability of space to accommodate additional equipment. VR data showed that participants in Room 2 had significantly higher visibility to both patient and care partners throughout their simulated interaction. Simulation-based evaluations in VR that use a combination of users' subjective insights and objective data obtained from VR can be an effective tool for helping designers evaluate multiple design options. The use of scenario-based simulations provided a structured and clinically relevant approach to comparing three preoperative rooms, supporting a more robust assessment of users' physical response to a simulated healthcare environment. ","258":"The purpose of this article was to explore how different types of mock-ups are being used in the healthcare design process and present a methodology framework for the process. Historically, physical mock-ups have been used in healthcare design primarily to test construction techniques. Although this historic use of mock-ups assisted the design team in decision-making, newer forms of mock-ups have evolved that expand the input provided into decision-making. These newer techniques, rapid prototyping, early build-out, virtual reality, and enhancements to the traditional physical mock-up focus more on challenging the functionality of the space, testing new operational concepts, and increasing user input. This methodology article utilized five case studies in which different types and combinations of mock-ups were used in the design process and then, the methodology compares the realism, immersion, and testability of each mock-up technique. For each mock-up type, the case studies described the purpose of the technique, the advantages and disadvantages, the most appropriate phase for its use in the design process, the estimated cost, and the process logistics. These components are compared to assist in developing a methodology for a variety of design situations. The findings related to different mock-up techniques are a valuable tool for healthcare design teams to use in selecting the most appropriate mock-up technique and the proposed methodology will assist in executing the mock-up process. ","259":"","260":"Research was conducted to investigate the impact of the hospital environment on older people including patients with dementia and their accompanying persons (APs). The article presents key research findings in the case study hospital. For many patients, the hospital is challenging due to the busy, unfamiliar, and stressful nature of the environment. For a person with dementia, the hospital experience can be exacerbated by cognitive impairment and behavioral or psychological symptoms and can therefore prove to be a frightening, distressing, and disorientating place. The findings are based on a stakeholder engagement process where the research team spent approximately 150 hr observing within the hospital, administered 95 questionnaires to patients and\/or APs, and conducted 12 structured interviews with patients and APs. A thematic analysis was employed to analyze and generate key themes emerging from the process. Themes were grouped into overarching issues and design issues across spatial scales. This research confirms the negative impact of the acute hospital setting on older people with cognitive impairments including dementia and delirium. The multiple perspectives captured in this study, including most importantly people with dementia, ensure that stakeholder needs can be used to inform the design of the hospital environment. The research points to the value of understanding the lived experience of the person with dementia and APs. The voices of patients, particularly persons with dementia and their APs, are a crucial element in helping hospitals to fulfill their role as caregiving and healing facilities. ","261":"The aim of this article is to outline overall goals, recommendations, and provide practical How-To strategies for developing and facilitating patient safety and system integration (PSSI) simulations for healthcare team members and organizations. Simulation is increasingly being used as a quality improvement tool to better understand the tasks, environments, and processes that support the delivery of healthcare services. These PSSI simulations paired with system-focused debriefing can occur prior to implementing a new process or workflow to proactively identify system issues. They occur as part of a continuous cycle of quality improvement and have unique considerations for planning, implementation, and delivery of healthcare. The Delphi technique was used to develop the recommendations and How-To strategies to guide those interested in conducting a PSSI simulations. The Delphi technique is a structured communication technique and systematic process of gathering information from a group of identified experts through a series of questionnaires to gain consensus regarding judgments on complex processes, where precise information is not available in the literature. The Delphi technique permitted an iterative and multistaged approach to transform expert opinions into group consensus. The goals, recommendations, and How-To strategies include a focus on project management, stakeholder engagement, sponsorship, scenario design, prebriefing and debriefing, and evaluation metrics. The intent is to proactively identify system issues and disseminate actionable findings. This article highlights salient features to consider when using simulation as a strategy and tool for patient safety and quality improvement.

Part of the design process in Australia and New Zealand, the purpose of interdisciplinary user group consultation is to design the best healthcare facilities possible within the parameters set by project clients and funding bodies. An online survey was used to explore how user group participants viewed the process, including how well informed they felt they were about their role\/s in it, its success in achieving specific outcomes for their project, and how they felt their project client, owner, or funding body assessed these same issues. It included both closed and open-ended questions, and data were then analyzed using an interpretative methodology by an architect researcher based in practice. Emergent issues identified include governance of the process, knowledge asymmetries between participants, missed opportunities for innovation, composition and workloads of user groups, and the quality of resources available to guide the process. The interdisciplinary user group process could be improved, and future research will look at how drawing on participatory design methods used in sectors such as urban planning may support the development of new techniques for conducting user groups. ","263":"Visibility has a significant impact on health-related outcomes and experiences of users in healthcare settings. Built environments determine interpersonal visual relationships between users and control their ability to see (or be seen by) others. Despite this importance, metrics that fully and precisely describe these interpersonal visual relationships are lacking. In this article, we introduce the Agent Visibility Analysis Model and the SAVisualPower software, which enable person-centric visibility analysis for quantifying visual relationships both among users and between users and visual targets. The model precisely captures users' visibility by reflecting the orientation of users and by differentiating visual contents of the users-space, other users, and targets. By providing practical examples of the new model using layouts from previous studies, this article describes specific visibility metrics that can be analyzed by the new tool and how the tool can be applied to design and research in healthcare settings for improved user experiences.","264":"The objective of this study is to determine the optimal allocation of budgets for pairs of alterations that reduce pathogenic bacterial transmission. Three alterations of the built environment are examined: handwashing stations (HW), relative humidity control (RH), and negatively pressured treatment rooms (NP). These interventions were evaluated to minimize total cost of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), including medical and litigation costs. HAIs are largely preventable but are difficult to control because of their multiple mechanisms of transmission. Moreover, the costs of HAIs and resulting mortality are increasing with the latest estimates at US$9.8 billion annually. Using 6 years of longitudinal multidrug-resistant infection data, we simulated the transmission of pathogenic bacteria and the infection control efforts of the three alterations using Chamchod and Ruan's model. We determined the optimal budget allocations among the alterations by representing them under Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for this nonlinear optimization problem. We examined 24 scenarios using three virulence levels across three facility sizes with varying budget levels. We found that in general, most of the budget is allocated to the NP or RH alterations in each intervention. At lower budgets, however, it was necessary to use the lower cost alterations, HW or RH. Mathematical optimization offers healthcare enterprise executives and engineers a tool to assist with the design of safer healthcare facilities within a fiscally constrained environment. Herein, models were developed for the optimal allocation of funds between HW, RH, and negatively pressured treatment rooms (NP) to best reduce HAIs. Specific strategies vary by facility size and virulence. ","265":"The purpose of this methodology is to define a process for facility planning teams to use to ensure research findings are used to guide decision making in the design process. Over the past decade and a half, research in health facility design has developed and the body of knowledge has grown significantly, but at the same time, the process for incorporating these findings into the design process has been less defined. This methodology evolved out of the desire to develop a structured process to integrate recent research findings into the planning and programming process at the user group and planning team level. This two-phase methodology consists of, first, reviewing recent, relevant research on the topic, classifying the findings into positive and negative attributes and, then, summarizing the attributes by category on a summary table and in a brief narrative. The second phase consists of reviewing the research to identify operational and facility strategies that can be used to mitigate the inconsistent and negative attributes identified. In the case study, as a result of this process, one inconsistent attribute and three negative attributes were identified. In the second phase, potential research-based operational and facility strategies were identified to mitigate the inconsistent and negative attributes identified. This information served as the basis for making design decisions. This methodology presents an organized, efficient process for organizing and providing relevant research findings to a facility planning team to use in evaluating a new healthcare design concept and making research-based design decisions.

Demonstrate the actionable representations of the data that can be collected using this workflow. The design of the healthcare built environment impacts the delivery of patient care and operational efficiency. Studying this environment presents a series of challenges due to the limitations associated with existing technology such as radio-frequency identification. The authors designed a customized mapping workflow to collect high-resolution spatial, temporal, and activity data to improve healthcare environments, with emphasis on patient safety and operational efficiency. A large, urban, academic medical center ED collaborated with an architecture firm to create a data collection, and mapping workflow using ArcGIS tools and data collectors. The authors developed tools to collect data on the entire ED, as well as individual patients, physicians, and nurses. Advanced visual representations were created from the master data set. In 48 consecutive hourly snapshots, 5,113 data points were collected on patients, physicians, nurses, and other staff reflecting the operations of the ED. Separately, 84 patients, 10 attending physicians, 10 resident physicians, and 17 nurses were tracked. The data obtained from this pilot study were used to create advanced visual representations of the ED environment. This cost-effective ED mapping workflow may be applied to other healthcare settings. Further investigation to evaluate the benefits of this high-resolution data is required. ","267":"To determine whether using existing noise reduction strategies improves patients' overall satisfaction level during hospitalization on an adult outpatient cardiology unit and to assess whether noise reduction strategies were effective to decrease the ambient noise for both staff and patient environments. Excessive noise is a worldwide problem facing hospitals today. Noise has been proven to be detrimental to staff and patient well-being and hospital environment satisfaction levels. Staff noise perception online surveys, a poster presentation, and education of noise reduction strategies were completed. Two 6-week phases of pre- and postimplementation noise reduction strategies were initiated including closing of the doors, verbal and visual alarm reminders for staff, posting quiet signs, and limiting equipment through the unit. Patient telephone interviews regarding the noise environment during hospitalization in both phases and a follow-up staff noise perception online survey were completed. Staff surveys identified noise as an issue on the unit with staff communication (90%) being the main source. This correlated with patient surveys of five rooms closest to the desk considering the unit \"noisy.\" Post-implementation patient surveys noted that strategies created in helping the unit become \"quiet\/mostly quiet.\" Closing patient doors was most effective in noise reduction, increasing patient unit satisfaction. The use of visual cues and staff education are effective in reducing noise levels. Decreased noise levels improved overall patient satisfaction with their hospital experience and created a less stressful work environment.

To measure family presence at night before and after moving to an ICU with in-room family space. The safeguarding phenomenon families experience may lead to the desire to sit vigil at the bedside. Lack of dedicated family sleep space may exacerbate sleep deprivation for those who wish to be present at night. Sleep deprivation decreases cognition and capacity for decision-making. Traditionally, ICU rooms have not included dedicated family areas or sleep surfaces. National recommendations include designing new hospital ICU rooms with dedicated family space. It is not known if the built design changes family presence at night. Family presence was measured for 30 nights pre- and postmove to a newly built ICU with dedicated family space. The policy for open flexible family presence remained the same before and after the move. There was a statistically significant increase in proportion of occupied patient rooms with visitors following the move to the new ICU designed with family space (31% difference, x2= 5.675, 95% CI [5.74, 51.29], p = .0172). Families utilize the space when available. Further research is needed to quantify quality and quantity of family sleep and impact on decision-making and interactions with the care team. Sleep deprivation may decrease for families who would have remained in the unit without available family space and sleep surface. ","269":"To examine whether patients' experiences could be improved during colonoscopy by designing the examination room to include a digital screen showing calm nature films. Colonoscopy is the gold standard for examination of the large intestine and the rectum. Around 50% of individuals invited for colorectal cancer screening choose to refrain from the screening due to fear and anxiety. It is therefore important to improve patients' comfort during the procedure. One of the four endoscopy rooms was rebuilt to include a large digital screen showing calm nature films. Patients were randomized to intervention (i.e., the room showing films) or control. During the colonoscopy, pulse and oxygen saturation were measured and the patients graded the intensity of pain and anxiety. Blood samples were taken regularly during the examination and were analyzed for glucose, cortisol, and prolactin. The presence of calm nature films during colonoscopy decreased the release of cortisol, increased prolactin levels, and enhanced oxygen saturation. These effects were more apparent in patients who were unfamiliar with the procedure and the environment, patients who underwent the examination without analgesics or sedation, and patients whose examination procedure was relatively difficult and took a long time. The intervention described in this study is easy to implement and might help improve the patient experience during colonoscopy. However, this study was performed in a single health institution, and more studies are needed to further explore the role of film interventions in endoscopic and other medical procedures.

Protocols encourage healthcare team communication before and after primary care visits to support better patient care. Physical clinic environments may influence these behaviors, but limited research has been performed. We conducted observations, three interviews with clinic managers, and six focus groups with 21 providers and staff at three family medicine teaching clinics. Observational data were captured through field notes and spaghetti diagrams. Interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory-based approach to understand how aspects of the clinic environment affected communication, efficiency, and privacy. Variations in communication styles and trade-offs between patient contact and privacy emerged as differences. In the onstage\/offstage design, colocated teams had increased verbal communication but perceived being isolated from other clinic teams. In contrast, teams in PB clinics communicated with other clinic teams but had more informal patient contact within care-team stations that imposed privacy risk. Primary care clinic design appears to alter provider-team and patient-provider communication and flow. Organizations should consider aligning environmental design with desired interaction patterns when building new primary care clinics.

A current hospital design trend is to include decentralized caregiver workstations on inpatient units. A review of literature addressing decentralized unit design is needed. The systematic review methodology was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Database searches were conducted for studies published in peer-reviewed journals through October 2017. Included were empirical studies associating patient and\/or staff outcomes and unit design with decentralized caregiver workstations. Individual studies were evaluated for quality using established methods, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and GRADE-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) guided rigorous inspection of evidence quality and strength for quantitative outcomes and qualitative findings, respectively. The search yielded 1,096 records with 36 full-text articles examined and 12 articles included in the final review. This work was dominated by studies with limited analyses. Staff outcomes have been most widely studied, especially collaboration\/communication and walking. Overall, studies exploring decentralized nursing as a design intervention have produced limited results for both staff and patient outcomes. Strength of evidence of the current literature with quantitative methods as a whole was rated very low quality. Although varying degrees of caregiver workstation decentralization in inpatient units are now common, the literature addressing the impacts of such designs is of very low quality and shows inconsistency in associated outcomes. Rigorous, well-designed studies with consistently defined design and outcome measures are needed for greater confidence in determining any effects of decentralized unit design.

There is currently no consensus regarding how the design of inpatient rehabilitation facilities could be optimized for patients' learning. We used Value-Focused Thinking to develop a framework of what interdisciplinary experts consider important for inpatient stroke rehabilitation facility design. Two workshops were conducted. The following experts were invited to participate: past patients with experience of stroke rehabilitation; stroke rehabilitation clinicians; stroke rehabilitation academics; healthcare environments academics; learning environments academics; architects, designers, and wayfinders with experience designing healthcare or learning environments; and healthcare design policy makers. Thirty experts participated. The experts' final framework included 16 criteria that were considered fundamentally important for inpatient stroke rehabilitation facility design, and 14 criteria that were considered instrumentally important. Inpatient stroke rehabilitation facility design should maximize efficiency, maximize effectiveness (i.e., patients' clinical and functional outcomes), foster emotional well-being, and maximize safety. Opportunities to practice physical, cognitive, and social activity were considered important for patients' outcomes. Value-Focused Thinking was an effective and equitable means of engaging experts from multiple disciplines. Designers, planners, and developers of inpatient stroke rehabilitation facilities should consider the rehabilitation-specific framework developed in this study alongside evidence from other healthcare settings.

Due to the high degree of variation in study designs and results on this topic, the implications have been difficult to interpret. This review consolidates studies on the impact of bright light exposure on sleep to identify lighting conditions that can be applied and researched in future healthcare environments. We searched for peer-reviewed articles on the impact of light on sleep or sleep-related outcomes in healthcare settings. We provided detailed analysis of the direct links between light and sleep, and a more cursory analysis of links between light and sleep-related factors, from 34 articles which met our inclusion criteria. The current state of the literature includes evidence on how various durations and intensities of morning, midday, and evening bright light exposure, as well as whole-day light exposure interventions can improve specific aspects of sleep. Lighting interventions differed in all attributes (illuminance levels, exposure time, exposure duration, and spectral qualities) but showed promising results in improving patients' sleep. Short-term bright light exposure in the morning, up to 2 hr of moderate (3,000-10,000 lux) morning exposures, up to 4 hr of moderate evening exposure, and whole-day exposures to lower illuminance levels (&lt;3,000 lux) can improve patient sleep outcomes.

Medical interventions during childbirth have consequences for the health of women and babies in the immediate and long term. The increase in interventions is multifactorial and may be influenced by the model of care adopted, the relationships between caregivers and the organizational culture, which is made up of many factors, including the built environment. In the field of birth architecture research, there is a gap in the description of the physical characteristics of birth environments that impact users' health. A scoping review on the topic was performed to understand the direct and indirect impacts of the physical environment on birth intervention rates. The findings are organized into three tables reporting the influence that the physical characteristics of a space might have on people's behaviors, experiences, practices and birth health outcomes. Eight building spaces that require further investigation and research were highlighted: unit layout configuration, midwives' hub\/desk, social room, birth philosophy vectors, configuration of the birth room, size and shape of the birth room, filter, and sensory elements.

An observational study reporting participants' location, people present, body position, and activity type on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day using behavior mapping techniques. Fifteen participants were observed in a mixed rehabilitation unit with neurological, orthopedic, and other health conditions. Results were calculated as the proportion of observations participants spent in each location, position, and performing activities (physical, cognitive, social), and time spent alone and inactive. On average, participants were engaged in activity for 86% (standard deviation [SD] = 9) of the day, with physical activity accounting for 51% (SD = 11), cognitive activity 28% (SD = 10), and social activity 42% (SD = 16).

SHfE users include older adults, their family members, and healthcare staff. Globally, countries are experiencing the challenges of an increasingly aging population. A healthy environment is essential to support aging in place. By applying information and communications technology to building environments to support health, smart homes may be an option to provide a low-cost, comfortable, and user-friendly living environment for older adults. A pilot study was conducted in a capital city in the Yangtze River Delta Agglomerations in China to verify the feasibility of the SHfE. One female older adult participated in the pilot study, which was conducted from November 2015 to January 2016. The results indicated that the SHfE is a feasible way to analyze the behaviors (e.g., sleeping, cooking, water usage) of the elder and monitor the built environment (e.g., temperature, windows, and doors). The pilot study can be used as a baseline for further comprehensive experiments, case studies, and surveys to gain a better understanding of a smart healthy environment for older adults. On the basis of the current study, several recommendations are put forward for further implementation of the SHfE, including integrating multiple unobtrusive sensing devices; detecting fall accidents; monitoring indoor lighting, noise, and ventilation; remotely controlling electrical appliances; and developing the system with various languages.

Exam room features can affect the delivery of patient-centered care and enhance the level of communication, which has been shown to directly impact clinical outcomes. Although there has been an increasing body of literature examining design and patient-centered care, little research has evaluated the extent to which information sharing and electronic health record (EHR) interaction are impacted. The research randomly allocated 22 patients, 28 caregivers, and 59 clinicians to simulated clinical encounters in four exam room mock-ups with semi-inclusive, exclusive, and inclusive layouts (128 sessions in 32 scenarios). Video recordings of the simulations were coded for clinician gazing, talking, and EHR-interaction behaviors. Participants also completed surveys and answered open-ended questions after experiencing each scenario (N = 362). Semi-inclusive rooms with a triangular arrangement of consultation table, sharable screens, exam table, and caregiver chair were highly preferred as they supported conversation, gazing, and information sharing. The inclusive layout had higher durations of EHR interactions and enhanced viewing and sharing of EHR information. However, this layout was criticized for the lack of clinician-shared information. The exclusive layouts impeded information sharing, eye contact, and constrained simultaneous data entry and eye contact for clinicians. The distance and orientation between chair, exam table, curtain, and door were important for protecting patient and family comfort and privacy.

","285":"This postoccupancy study sought to understand whether a decentralized unit design supported a postpartum care delivery model by evaluating nurses' efficiency, staff perception, acoustical conditions, and patient satisfaction. Today, standardization and decentralization design concepts are being applied to all types of inpatient unit. There have been many studies that investigated how these concepts influence care delivery on medical-surgical units, but no study has evaluated a postpartum unit. This study utilized a mixed-method approach that involved unobtrusive shadowing (roughly 25 hr) and surveying (n = 19) of nursing staff, physical acoustic readings (eight, 24-hr readings), and comparison of patient satisfaction pre- and postmove. On average, nurses spent roughly 36.90% of their time at charting stations. Nurses were observed mostly using the central charting station located at the entry of the unit and adjacent to the well-baby nursery rather than the five decentralized chart stations. This was due to nurses operating with old workflow habits, not fully integrating electronic medical records, and needing to be near the nursery and other nurses. Nurses were satisfied with their ability to interact and their proximity to supplies, patients, and team members while in the central charting station. Additionally, patient satisfaction significantly increased postmove, particularly with the overall hospital's quietness and cleanliness. This study highlights the importance of aligning administrative operations of the unit with the design intent. Although standardization and decentralization design concepts aimed to improve nurses' workflow, misalignment with the operations may not deliver the most optimal outcomes.

Concurrently, there has been a considerable development in the field of evidence-based design (EBD) on the impact the healthcare environment has on patients and the operations of clinical staff. Although tools are being developed to assist in measuring EBD principles, they have not been universally adopted by organizations regarding how they either develop or assess healthcare facilities. This case study focuses on our attempt to implement an internal facilities evaluation process and a Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) on a major Academic Medical Center's (AMC) new bed tower. An assembled auditing team comprised of diverse professional healthcare backgrounds performed an audit on three patient rooms using a Center for Health Design POE Questionnaire. The results of this evaluation were then compared to the guiding principles developed for the hospital during its design. Results indicated that the project narrowly missed the threshold score agreed upon by the AMC's facilities leadership. This project demonstrated the difficulty in implementing a POE without prior experience, while highlighting the value of a standardized evaluation tool to assess past and future facilities projects.","288":"To provide a historical review on the evolution of contemporary Chinese nursing unit design and contextual factors that drive the design and changes. China is undergoing a major healthcare construction boom. A systematic investigation of the characteristics and development of Chinese nursing unit design is warranted to help U.S. healthcare designers to provide design that fits the local context. The investigation is developed in two phases. The first phase is a large-scale spatial analysis of 176 Chinese acute care unit layouts from three periods: 1989-1999, 1999-2004, and 2005-2015. In addition to qualitative descriptions of the nursing unit typologies, the percentage of various typologies, patient room (PR) types, the number of beds, visibility from nurse station (NS) to PRs, and access to natural light during each period were evaluated quantitatively. The second phase defined key factors that shape Chinese nursing unit design through expert interviews. Significant differences were found between design in these three periods. Chinese nursing unit size has continuously grown in the number of beds. Most PRs have shifted from three-bed to double-bed rooms. Most Chinese hospitals use single corridor, racetrack, and mutated racetrack layouts. Mutated racetrack has taken over single corridor as the dominant configuration. The access to southern sunlight remains important. The average visibility from NS to some PRs is restricted by the preferences of allocating most PRs on the south side of a unit. Chinese nursing unit design has undergone transformations to fit the local cultural, socioeconomic context and staffing model.

This article examines whether, in the context of a pediatric hospital, a distraction needs to \"hold attention\" to secure positive benefits for patient well-being. Data collected from 246 patients at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital (Australia) revealed a discrepancy between what children and young people told us they did, and valued, within the hospital, relative to the time they spent engaging in, or paying attention to, these same features. This motivated a closer interrogation of the relationship between well-being, distraction, and socialization within the pediatric context. Data were collected using a mixed-methods approach that included 178 surveys, 43 drawings contributed by patients\/siblings within the outpatient waiting room, 25 photo-elicitation interviews with patients, and 100 hr of spatial observations within public and waiting room spaces. This was supplemented by interviews with architects and hospital staff. The mechanism by which we have understood positive distraction to contribute to well-being within the pediatric hospital environment is more complex than existing models accept. Within this context, environmental features that can positively transform expectations of visiting the hospital-that can ignite the imagination and incite a desire to return-can offer significant benefits to well-being. This is particularly relevant in the context of absenteeism from outpatient appointments and in reducing patient resistance to future, or ongoing, treatments. ","291":"This article provides a set of recommendations, selected from the systematic literature review carried out, regarding signage systems for healthcare institutions that can be used for designing or redesigning more competent signage systems. The signage systems in healthcare settings are usually poorly designed due to the expansion of the original facilities, a lack of awareness of existing guidelines by the developers, and a lack of agreement between the existing recommendations. There are several guidelines and recommendations available in the literature; however, each work was developed for specific cultural contexts, so there is a lack of uniformity among them. Hence, there is a need to uniformize the guidelines for signage design in healthcare, in order to provide supportive information for developers to build and implement effective and efficient signage systems. This study examined the available literature on the subject and established a set of guidelines organized in categories to help the design process. A literature review was conducted, and 34 selected publications were analyzed from which recommendations were created. A best practices manual was also studied and used as the analytical framework to establish the design categories of the developed recommendations. This review resulted in guidelines divided into nine design categories that should be considered in the design and implementation process of signage systems in healthcare facilities.","292":"This study aims to explore the rural residents' preferences on various aspects of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model and the associated physical environment features. The PCMH model has gained popularity as an innovative care model that intends to improve patient experience and outcomes while reducing costs. Yet few studies focused on patients' perspective, even less considered the needs of the rural communities. Using a convenience sample, an exploratory survey was completed by 362 rural residents in the Midwestern region. Survey items were designed to gather information on both rural residents' preferences for five key PCMH attributes (comprehensive, patient-centered, coordinated, accessible, and quality) and of the physical environment that supports these attributes. Analyses were arranged along these key attributes. Results indicated that residents' demographics affect their preferences for spatial features for PCMH. The three most important environmental factors for PCMH for the rural residents are the privacy, extra chairs in the exam room for family, and space that supports information sharing and communication among patient, family, and healthcare staff. Through structural equation modeling analysis, residents' preferences on comprehensive care, patient-centered care, coordinated care, quality, and safety have shown to affect their preference for the space features. The open-ended survey shows that rural residents are mostly satisfied with their current healthcare environment in terms of supporting patient-centered care, while other aspects still have room for future improvement. Overall, this exploratory study identified important attributes of the physical environment that can support PCMH from rural residents' perspective. ","293":"This article describes an approach to a metrics-based evaluation of public space in hospitals using cross-disciplinary qualitative and quantitative analyses. The method, Indoor Public Space Measurement (IPSM), is well suited to researchers and designers who intend to evaluate user-centered spatial solutions in hospitals and similar facilities. Healthcare is transiting toward a value-based policy at all levels. Choosing the right set of qualitative and quantitative analyses to support value-based design solutions is not always an easy journey for healthcare design consultants. This article seeks to pull together the key analyses to evaluate the impact of the hospital indoor public space on the psychosocial well-being of the hospital users. A step-by step guide to performing key analyses to evaluate the impact of hospital indoor public space environment on the users' psychosocial well-being is provided. A case study from the authors' research is utilized to illustrate the application of the method. Interpolating the results of all the analyses, the reader can identify where in the layout most of interactions among users occur, identify their typology and evaluate the contribution to the general psychosocial well-being, and know which group of users is more exposed to a specific typology of interaction. The IPSM method can help design consultants to measure the impact of the built environment of hospital public space on its occupants' psychosocial well-being: factual knowledge about the users' behavioral response with respect to wayfinding and social interaction. The application of the method is not limited to healthcare settings only. ","294":"This review describes the facilitators and barriers impacting on passive access to green spaces within healthcare settings. A systematic mixed-studies review was undertaken to review the quantitative and qualitative evidence on access to green spaces within healthcare settings, as well as to review the methodological quality of the studies eligible for inclusion. A total of 24 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The barriers to access were grouped into three themes: \"awareness,\" \"accessibility,\" and \"comfort.\" The facilitators were grouped into 13 themes: \"flora and foliage,\" \"views,\" \"water features,\" \"sun, rain, fresh air, wind,\" \"animal life,\" \"diverse textures, heights, shapes,\" \"lawn,\" \"natural versus artificial material,\" \"rest areas,\" \"shade,\" \"private areas,\" \"play equipment,\" and \"safety.\" These findings can be explained through multiple lenses, using existing theories on contact with nature and supportive garden design. In an era of elevated stress, patient admissions, and staff turnover in hospitals, and rising costs of providing healthcare services, the creation of settings conducive to health promotion, stress reduction, and faster recovery is relevant and timely. This article, which has collated over three decades of research evidence, is invaluable in addressing this issue.","295":"The objective of this article is to identify and analyze what is known about characteristics in and around the home that support well-being for those with cognitive impairment. This could provide direction for designers of homes in general, but specifically for designers trying to meet the needs of people with cognitive impairment. It has been established that there is a relationship between psychological well-being and a person's environment. Research also shows that particular design aspects can reduce the impact of cognitive impairment. However, there is limited design expertise in the Australian housing market to create supportive spaces which will help to reduce the impact of the disability for those with cognitive impairment. A literature review was carried out to determine the extent and details of what is known about the relationship of home design and its impact on emotional, psychological, or social well-being for people with cognitive impairment. The study indicates that researchers in various disciplines understand that pragmatic design inputs such as thermal comfort and adequate lighting are important for people with cognitive impairment. In addition, some researchers have shown or surmise that there are other \"intangible\" designer-controlled elements that have beneficial impacts on people with cognitive impairment. Details of these intangible elements are sparse, and how much they might improve the quality of life for a person with cognitive impairment is not well understood. Further research is required to meet a growing need. ","296":"This study concerned optimization of an evidence-based crisis shelter garden as a setting for everyday activities and nature-based therapy. The study hereby tested the design guidelines that the garden is based on. Design guidelines for gardens intended to support health are becoming increasingly specialized, targeting different user groups. This study contributes to the knowledge concerning health-supporting garden design at crisis shelters for women and children who are exposed to domestic violence. The study included a post-occupancy evaluation (POE) consisting of landscape analyses, observation of physical traces, and interviews as well as a subsequent participatory design process. The landscape analyses and the observation of physical traces indicated a minimal level of maintenance and recurrent use being limited to a few areas of the garden. The interviews added nuance and new issues to these results, resulting in the following themes: maintenance, accessibility, safety, therapeutic setting and free space, many ways to play, and social and private spheres. The participatory design process led to an optimization of the garden, including changes to its physical design related to making the garden safer, positively distractive, and more versatile in terms of activities. Improvements were also made regarding policy for use, maintenance, and informing users. The design guidelines were tested, and the evidence was strengthened, adding nuance and new issues to consider during further development of the guidelines. Both the POE and the participatory design process were confirmed as crucial aspects of evidence-based health design. ","297":"","298":"","299":"","300":"The objective of this systematic review of literature was to critically evaluate peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effectiveness of decentralized nurse stations (DNSs). The DNS has become an important topic in healthcare design research and practice over the past decade with aims of improving staff efficiency and patient experience. Research has shown to be inconclusive, with studies reporting an assortment of mixed findings. A systematic review of literature was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses search process of electronic databases, citation tracking, and manual searches of references. All authors evaluated the studies independently. Studies included were empirical, peer-reviewed investigations of DNS in hospitals over the past 15 years. Each study was evaluated using an accepted healthcare design evaluation framework. Over 200 studies were identified. After exclusions, 21 studies published since 2003 were available for full evaluation. Key findings from this review include (a) there is a positive trend toward patient experience in units with DNS, (b) nursing teamwork was perceived to decline in units with DNS, (c) methodological issues may be responsible for the mixed and inconsistent findings, and (d) there is no consistent categorization of nurse station typology or standard definition for DNS. Based on the evaluation framework, DNS are supportive of the patient experience yet have a negative impact on nursing teamwork. Higher quality studies are needed to classify specific typologies of DNS and account for elements such as patient care models, communication, visibility, and other patient care-related factors. ","301":"To investigate whether a patient's proximity to the nurse's station or ward entrance at time of admission was associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive adult inpatients to 13 medical-surgical wards at an academic hospital from 2009 to 2013. Proximity of admission room to the nurse's station and to the ward entrance was measured using Euclidean distances. Outcomes of interest include development of critical illness (defined as cardiac arrests or transfer to an intensive care unit), inhospital mortality, and increase in length of stay (LOS). Of the 83,635 admissions, 4,129 developed critical illness and 1,316 died. The median LOS was 3 days. After adjusting for admission severity of illness, ward, shift, and year, we found no relationship between proximity at admission to nurse's station our outcomes. However, patients admitted to end of the ward had higher risk of developing critical illness (odds ratio [ OR] = 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.08, 1.23]), mortality ( OR = 1.16, 95% CI [1.03, 1.33]), and a higher LOS (13-hr increase, 95% CI [10, 15] hours) compared to patients admitted closer to the ward entrance. Similar results were observed in sensitivity analyses adjusting for isolation room patients and considering patients without room transfers in the first 48 hr. Our study suggests that being away from the nurse's station did not increase the risk of these adverse events in ward patients, but being farther from the ward entrance was associated with increase in risk of adverse outcomes. Patient safety can be improved by recognizing this additional risk factor. ","302":"The aim of this study was to explore patients' experiences of the physical environment at a newly built stroke unit. For a person who survives a stroke, life can change dramatically. The physical environment is essential for patients' health and well-being. To reduce infections, a majority of new healthcare facilities mainly have a single-room design. However, in the context of stroke care, knowledge of how patients experience the physical environment, particularly their experience of a single-room design, is scarce. This study used a qualitative design. Patients (n = 16) participated in semistructured individual interviews. Data were collected in December 2015 and February 2017 in Sweden; interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis. Two main themes were identified: (i) incongruence exists between community and privacy and (ii) connectedness with the outside world provides distraction and a sense of normality. In single rooms, social support was absent and a sense of loneliness was expressed. Patients were positively distracted when they looked at nature or activities that went on outside their windows. The physical environment is significant for patients with stroke. This study highlights potential areas for architectural improvements in stroke units, primarily around designing communal areas with meeting places and providing opportunities to participate in the world outside the unit. A future challenge is to design stroke units that support both community and privacy. Exploring patients' experiences could be a starting point when designing new healthcare environments and inform evidence-based design. ","303":"This methods column guides health care professionals engaged in design practice to write about their experiences. But it is more than an autobiographical approach. Autoethnographic writing is a scientific method which contextualizes experiences in cultural, social, political and personal history. Through an evidence based approach, professionals in academic, practice, and research can bring their past experiences to a place in the present, and provide direction for future professionals. The six steps outlined here: selecting an approach; ensuring ethical responsibility; deciding theoretical underpinnings; assembling and gathering data; reflecting and analyzing; and disseminating work with supporting drawings, photography, and other evocative formats. With autoethnography our current generation of leaders can not only better understand their own work, but plan for new directions in their future practices and those of the next generation of scholars and practitioners.","304":"To examine the magnitude of impact of two nature-themed window murals on physiological processes, as measured by heart rate and blood pressure, of pediatric patients. Many children and adolescents find at least one aspect of the hospitalization process frightening or anxiety provoking. One physical feature linked to stress reduction is access to positive distractions. Views of nature are one of the most common forms of positive distractions in healthcare environments. Patient room windows are the most common way patients are exposed to natural elements. Exposure to views of nature is linked to a number of positive impacts on physiological outcomes. Unfortunately, not every patient room will be able to provide a nature-filled window view. In situations where nature scenes do not occur, enhanced nature views may be utilized to replicate many of the same benefits as actual nature views. Pediatric patients were randomly assigned to one of the three room conditions: aquatic window mural, tree window mural, or control condition. The medical data of participants ( n = 90) who stayed in the rooms were gathered and evaluated for differences. Data analysis supports the notion that patient stress is heightened at the time of admission. Patients in the rooms with murals were found to have improvements in heart rate and systolic blood pressure in comparison to patients in control rooms, suggesting that the murals had an impact on physiological processes. Data also suggest that subject matter played a role, as patients in tree murals rooms had the most health-related outcomes. ","305":"To assess the feasibility of quantifying variation in childbirth facility design and explore the implications for childbirth service delivery across the United States. Design has been shown to impact quality of care in childbirth. However, most prior studies use qualitative data to examine associations between the design of patient rooms and patient experience. There has been limited exploration of measures of unit design and its impact on care provision. We recruited 12 childbirth facilities that were diverse with regard to facility type, location, delivery volume, cesarean delivery rate, and practice model. Each facility provided annotated floor plans and participated in a site visit or telephone interview to provide information on their design and clinical practices. These data were analyzed with self-reported primary cesarean delivery rates to assess associations between design and care delivery. We observed wide variation in childbirth unit design. Deliveries per labor room per year ranged from 75 to 479. The ratio of operating rooms to labor rooms ranged from 1:1 to 1:9. The average distance between labor rooms and workstations ranged from 23 to 114 ft, and the maximum distance between labor rooms ranged from 9 to 242 ft. More deliveries per room, fewer labor rooms per operating room, and longer distances between spaces were all associated with higher primary cesarean delivery rates. Clinically relevant differences in design can be feasibly measured across diverse childbirth facilities. The design of these facilities may not be optimally matched to service delivery needs.

The aim was to design an environment that could accommodate the wish to support professionalism while creating better and more cohesive patient treatment, improved patient safety, greater efficiency, higher quality, and stronger focus on the patient. The theoretical and analytical account is conducted within the framework of design thinking (DT), replacing the traditional evidence-based design approach with an evidence-based design thinking (EBDT) process underpinning participatory DT and co-creation. Based on a longitudinal case study on a participatory design process, interviews are conducted. DT principles are used in the analysis of the interviews. Genuineness arises when all users experience that the physical setting optimally underpins the birthing situation. It is essential to make visible the importance of the physical setting to human behavior in any situation. This study shows that midwives intuitively do EBDT. EBDT commands awareness of both research, design, midwifery care, and perspectives on space from women giving birth and their relatives. Collectively, that can provide the genuine scope of a healing birth environment. ","308":"This article aims to provide a description of fundamental elements of discrete event simulation (DES), the process and the values of applying DES in assisting healthcare design and planning decision-making. More importantly, it explores how new technology such as electronic medical records, real-time location services (RTLS), and other simulation methods such as space syntax analysis (SSA) can facilitate and complement DES. Healthcare administrators increasingly recognize DES as an effective tool for allocating resources and process improvement. However, limited studies have described specifically how DES can facilitate healthcare design. Three case studies were provided to illustrate the value of DES in supporting healthcare design. The first case study used DES to validate a surgical suite design for shorter surgeon walking distance. The second case study used DES to facilitate capacity planning in a clinic through testing the utilization of exam rooms upon various growth scenario. The detailed process data for the current clinic were captured through RTLS tracking. The third case study applied DES in an emergency department for both site selection in master planning and capacity test at various growth scenarios with seasonal volume swing. In addition, SSA was conducted to evaluate the impacts of design on visual surveillance, team communication, and co-awareness. It is recognized that the DES analysis is an effective tool to address the process aspects of healthcare environments and should be combined with post-occupancy evaluation and SSA to address behavioral aspects of operations to provide more solid evidence for future design. ","309":"To identify spatial design factors that influence informal interprofessional team-based communication within hospital emergency departments (EDs). Effective team communication in EDs is critical for interprofessional collaborative care and prevention of serious errors due to miscommunication. Limited evidence exists about how informal communication in EDs is shaped by the physical workspace and how workplace design principles can improve the quality of ED team communication. Two health services with four hospital sites in Victoria, Australia, participated. A multistage mixed-methods approach used (1) an anonymous online communication network survey ( N = 103) to collect data on patterns and locations of informal interprofessional team communication among ED staff, (2) focus groups ( N = 37) and interviews ( N = 3) using photoelicitation to understand the perspectives of ED staff about how spatial design influences team communication, and (3) validity testing of preliminary findings with executives and ED managers at the participating sites. Informal communication with peers and within discipline groups on nonspecific areas of the ED was most common. Three key factors influenced the extent to which ED workspaces facilitated informal communication: (1) staff perceptions of privacy, (2) staff perceptions of safety, and (3) staff perceptions of connectedness to ED activity. Our research supports the proposition that ED physical environments influence informal team communication patterns. To facilitate effective team communication, ED workspace spatial designs need to provide visibility and connectedness, support and capture \"case talk,\" enable privacy for \"comfort talk,\" and optimize proximity to patients without compromising safety. ","310":"The purpose of this study was to identify the role of emergency department (ED) design on ED staff satisfaction and performance. High patient volume, surging workloads, and violent behaviors are expected pressures for ED staff. Literature suggests the substantial role of the physical environment in the delivery of care and its role in staff and patient experiences. Nevertheless, limited studies have explored simultaneous interactions between ED physical design elements, attributes (security, wayfinding, visibility, privacy, and efficiency), and staff satisfaction or performance. Interviews, surveys, visibility graph analysis, and agent simulations were employed to understand the connection between ED physical design, attributes, performance, and staff satisfaction. Enhanced security, effective wayfinding, team visibility, noise reduction, adequate privacy, and accessible supplies and equipment were significant predictors of staff satisfaction and performance. Unobstructed views in waiting and triage and controlled entrances were critical for improving security. To improve wayfinding, eye-level signage, reducing surveillance obstacles, and creating direct public routes were recommended. Rectangular units with multiple perpendicularly connected corridors and linear pod arrangements enhanced movement. Including team rooms and enclosed ERs were recommended for privacy improvements. Visibility was critical for team communication and improved by including short-distanced perpendicular corridors and eliminating columns. Enhancing access to supplies or equipment and reducing noise levels improved the perception of staff efficiency. The findings contribute to the general body of knowledge on the impact of ED physical design on attributes that potentially improve staff satisfaction and work performance. ","311":"We aim to gain insight into how a dementia special care unit is used and experienced by its residents and what design aspects are important therein. In Flanders, housing for people with dementia evolves toward small-scale, homelike environments. As population aging challenges the affordability of this evolution, architects and other designers are asked to design dementia special care units that offer the advantages of small scaleness within the context of large-scale residential care facilities. How these units are used and experienced is not systematically evaluated. A case study was conducted in a recently built residential care facility where a dementia special care unit was foreseen on the ground floor, yet after a few months was moved to the top floor. The case study combined architectural analysis, participant observation, and qualitative interviews with residents and care staff. Comparing the original situation on the ground floor with the new situation on the top floor highlights how enclosure (physical and visual access to outside and the rest of the facility) and spatial organization affect how residents use and experience a dementia special care unit. Depending on the type and stage of dementia, residents may have different needs for space to move, sensory stimuli, and social contact. In order to meet these different needs, confining residents to a dementia special care unit to the top floor should be avoided unless it is carefully designed, providing sufficient freedom of movement and connection with the outside world. ","312":"The aim was to investigate the content and quality of the governing documents created in the planning and design phase of new healthcare environments and in the related healthcare strategic and operational plans. Quality deficits in buildings can often be traced back to the initial stages in the planning and design phase. Although large investments have been made to improve the process of planning new healthcare environments and linking the requirements to health service strategies, healthcare organizations rarely relate their strategy goals to the built environment. A retrospective review of documents created in the planning and design stages of new healthcare environments and the operational plans of the target organizations was conducted. The organizational operational plans did not contain any statements or information about the built environment or how a building could or should support the organization's goals. Important information was frequently absent from the documents governing the planning and design of buildings. The documents lacked information about what and how to follow-up and what to measure once a construction project had been completed. There were no references to evidence. Poor documentation might undermine the quality of the planning and design phase and ultimately the opportunity to create environments that support health outcomes. Therefore, more emphasis must be placed on the importance of documentation but above all to strengthen and clarify the relationship between the healthcare organization strategy to achieve an effective and efficient care process and the intention made in the planning and design process. ","313":"This review explored different conceptualizations of health promotion in the context of, and in relation to, outpatient building design. Today's healthcare organizations are implementing holistic healthcare approaches such as health promotion, while simultaneously increasing their outpatient services. These health promotion approaches, focused on empowering people to take control of their health, are expected to have implications for the outpatient healthcare building design. Yet there is limited knowledge what these may be. A review of the literature on the current state of the art is thus needed to enable and support dialog on future healthcare building design. A scoping review of 4,506 papers, collected from four databases and three scientific journals in 2015, resulted in 14 papers relating health promotion to building design and outpatient healthcare. From the subsequent content analysis, multiple common themes and subthemes emerged. The review reveals diverse range of health promotion interpretations, three health promotion perspectives (health behavior, health equity, and sense of coherence), associated design approaches, design objectives, health-related outcomes, building features, and solutions. While diverse health promotion perspectives might merely represent variations in focus, these differences become problematic when relating to building design. To support further dialogs on development of health promotion in, and in relation to, the build environment, there is a need to strengthen the health promotion vocabulary. Further research is needed to compare different design approaches and how these can be combined to minimize contradicting implications for building design. ","314":"The present study aims to examine the influence of environmental color hue in a lactation room at a health center on users' affective response and preference. Hospital design plays an important role in the emotional experience of patients. In this regard, many studies have attempted to find relationships between design variables and healthcare facilities users' response. Color has been frequently examined because it is always present in the environment and can be easily changed. However, most of the studies dealing with color-emotion relationships acquire users' affective response by questionnaires developed by experts which could lead to inaccurate results since nonexperts may misunderstand concepts set by experts and use nonimmersive images to simulate the environments to assess. To overcome these limitations, a Kansei Engineering-based approach was proposed. In the first phase, users' specific affective factors for lactation rooms were determined using Semantic Differential. In the second phase, the influence of nine different color hues on users' affective factors was obtained. An immersive display system was used to visualize the room altering hues in an isolated and controlled way. (1) Six user's affective factors connected to the lactation rooms were discovered: safety, elegance, coziness, spaciousness, simplicity, and luminosity, of which coziness has the most impact on the assessment of the room. (2) Warm colors like orange and yellow tend to score highly for coziness which puts them in leading positions when users' assess lactation rooms. Results provide recommendations for designers and show the advantages of using semantic differential and immersive displays to analyze user's affective response to environments. ","315":"The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of four different design communication media in helping clinical end users understand spatial and functional information and in supporting their ability to provide design feedback. It is critical to involve clinical end users early in the design process to test design solutions and ensure the design of a new healthcare facility supports their ability to deliver high-quality care. Traditional architectural design communication media such as floor plans and perspectives can be challenging for clinical design team members to understand. Physical and virtual mock-ups are becoming more popular as design communication media. However, nominal evidence exists comparing the effectiveness of different design media in supporting clinical end-user engagement and contribution during the design process. An exploratory, qualitative study was conducted with clinical end users to evaluate the effectiveness of four different media commonly used in design communication. Traditional architectural representations convey limited useful information to clinical end users, impacting the amount and type of feedback they can provide. More immersive media, such as physical and virtual mock-ups, support an increasingly holistic understanding of proposed design solutions, inciting more design solutions that range from the inclusion and exclusion of design features to location, position, and functionality of those features. When used in combination, each media can contribute to eliciting clinical end-user feedback at varying scales. The overall preference and higher effectiveness in eliciting design feedback from clinical end users highlights the importance of physical mock-up in communicating healthcare design solutions. ","316":"To identify family members' and visitors' needs with relation to the design of a hospital room. There is a trend toward incorporating family zones in hospital patient rooms in order to improve patient satisfaction and encourage family caregivers to stay longer and overnight. A mixed-method study was employed. Interviews of patients and family caregivers were conducted to understand opportunities to improve hospital room designs based on recent experiences. Features intended to support short-term and overnight visitors were embedded in five full-scale simulated room design concepts. Small groups of family caregivers and patients toured two room design concepts and reacted real time to room features. A grounded theory approach was employed to identify emerging themes. A theoretical design framework is developed for the needs of family members and visitors for a range of time periods. This framework is founded upon desires to help make the patient feel more comfortable. There are various levels of helping the patient feel more comfortable, including visiting, keeping company, providing support, providing assistance, and being a caregiver. Beyond this core need, family members and visitors must take care of their own needs in order to feel comfortable in the hospital room. Activities associated with these needs include sitting, relaxing, eating, working, tending to daily needs, and resting overnight. Potential implications for architects, healthcare planners, and interior space designers are described. Design and renovation guidance for the hospital room environment in order to support the needs and expectations of families and visitors is provided.

The majority of research performed on nursing units in China only focused on the spatial design itself, and few studies examined the nursing unit empirically based on nurses' experience. Nursing units need to be designed with understanding nurses' behavior and experience in China. A mixed-method approach was conducted in four double-corridor nursing units in China. Observation and interview data were collected to explore how physical environments for managing administrative duties, medications, and caring patient were used in nursing units. The most frequent activities were communication, medication, and patient-care activities. The places in which nurses spent the most of theirs working times were the nurse station (NS), patient room, workstation on wheels (WoW), and medication room. The important clinical work spaces were the patient room, NS, WoW, medication room, doctor's office, disposal room, examining room, and back corridor. The important traffic linkages were between NS and medication room, patient room and WoW, and medication room and patient room. This article revealed the frequency of nurse activities; how they spent their time; how they use the clinical spaces; identified important clinical spaces, linkages, and driver of inefficiency in nursing work and nursing unit design; and finally generated recommendations for double-corridor nursing unit design in China which can be used by medical planner, hospital administrator. ","321":"A study exploring facility-related barriers to healthcare participation (the level to which an individual is engaged or involved in their own healthcare activities from simply keeping appointments to following treatment regimens) in persons with disabilities in Appalachia from the perspectives of four stakeholder groups, (1) adults with disabilities, (2) caregivers of persons with disabilities, (3) advocates for persons with disabilities, and (4) providers who treat persons with disabilities. Persons with disabilities potentially face additional barriers to healthcare participation than those without disabilities. Understanding and addressing the barriers to participation could assist in improving healthcare outcomes among the disabled population. A qualitative study was conducted involving scripted focus groups with four stakeholder groups with expertise\/experience in disabilities. The objective was to assess perceptions of impacts of clinical design elements on healthcare participation. Participants identified and characterized six major categories of facility- and nonfacility-related barriers they felt impacted healthcare participation, with priority differences reported between each group. The healthcare facility is perhaps the most visible tool the provider has at his or her disposal to deliver effective healthcare. Understanding the interactions persons with different disabilities have with the physical facility and the messages, both intentional and unintentional, the state of the facility sends can provide useful insights into delivering more effective healthcare to this population. ","322":"In 2012, a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) transitioned from an open plan (OP) to a dual occupancy (DO) NICU. The DO design aimed to provide a developmental appropriate, family-centered environment for neonates and their families. During planning, staff questioned the impact DO would have on staff workflow and activity. To explore the impact of changing from an OP to a DO NICU, a prospective longitudinal study was undertaken from 2011 to 2014, using observational, time and motion, and surveys methods. Main outcome measures included distance walked by staff, minutes of staff activity, and staff perceptions of the DO design. Results highlighted no significant difference in the distances clinical nurses walked nor time spent providing direct clinical care, whereas technical support staff walked further than other staff in both designs. Staff perceived the DO design created a developmentally appropriate, family-centered environment that facilitated communication and collaboration between staff and families. Staff described the main challenges of the DO design such as effective staff communication, gaining educational opportunities, and the isolation of staff and families compared to the OP design. Our study provides new evidence that DO provides an improved developmentally environment and has similar positive benefits to single-family room for neonates and families. Such design may reduce the larger floor plan's impact on staff walking distance and work practices. Challenges of staff transition can be minimized by planning and leadership throughout the development and move to a new design.","323":"The study explored design for well-being within dementia care by investigating the adoption of well-being-focused design in real-world practice, through observing National Health Service (NHS) wards. Design for well-being is an approach that considers the psychological and physiological effects of architecture to improve health and well-being. The high psychological care requirement for dementia patients makes them a significant group to study in the evaluation of current hospital facilities. A literature review was conducted to frame the current theoretical perception of the key characteristics of a good environment for dementia care. A framework was generated to summarize and used as an assessment tool in a series of observational visits to NHS wards. Interviews with clinical staff focused on care outcomes and practicalities of implementing well-being-focused design, considering the historical and economical context. Key findings from the observations and interviews were analyzed for recurring themes. The ward observations and interviews provided insight into the current progression of well-being-led design in NHS hospitals in England. The research highlights key areas of success and factors that inhibit further progression. The case studies showed a good degree of ambition to utilize well-being-focused design, with belief among staff that the physical environment has a substantial role in the health and well-being of patients. Staff also felt that this approach is most effective for those in the less advanced stages of dementia. Despite the high level of support, the current degree of implementation appears to be varied. ","324":"The purpose of this research is to (1) investigate the impact of nursing unit design on nursing staff communication patterns and, ultimately, on patient falls in acute care nursing units; and (2) evaluate whether differences in fall rates, if found, were associated with the nursing unit physical structure (shape) or size. Nursing staff communication and nursing unit design are frequently linked to patient safety outcomes, yet little is known about the impact of specific nursing unit designs on nursing communication patterns that might affect patient falls. An exploratory longitudinal correlational design was used to measure nursing unit communication structures using social network analysis techniques. Data were collected 4 times over a 7-month period. Floor plans were used to determine nursing unit design. Fall rates were provided by hospital coordinators. An analysis of covariance controlling for hospitals resulted in a statistically significant interaction of unit shape and size (number of beds). The interaction occurred when medium- and large-sized racetrack-shaped units intersected with medium- and large-sized cross-shaped units. The results suggest that nursing unit design shape impacts nursing communication patterns, and the interaction of shape and size may impact patient falls. How those communication patterns affect patient falls should be considered when planning hospital construction of nursing care units. ","325":"The objective is to establish design strategies to help minimize nurse journeys and inform future decision-making. The impact of the ward layout was investigated through a case study ward in a multispecialty hospital in Tehran. Nurse teams have the most direct contact with ward patients. Time spent on activities not part of care provision should be minimized. Literature suggests that a significant part of nurses' time is spent moving between different places within wards, which emphasizes the importance of ward layout. The ethnographic method was adopted for observing nurses' actions based on routes that form a significant share of nurses' daily journeys. Data were collected from 42 nursing staff over 120 hr during different shifts. This provided empirical data on the frequency of each journey which revealed meaningful patterns. Approximately 1,300 room-to-room journeys were made. Conclusions were drawn about the criticality of each route. There is a significant difference between the frequencies of different routes in the case study ward. The distances between origins and destinations of the most frequently used journeys must remain minimal. Awareness of less frequent routes allows for greater flexibility in ward design. Arrangement of ward spaces can minimize journey times. Healthcare planners and designers can explore the implications of chosen systems on walking distance and, consequently, the nursing staff productivity. For existing wards, rearrangement of space utilization can improve staff productivity. The recommendations can be applied wherever productivity is influenced by walking distances. ","326":"To study the impact of hospital design on patient and family experiences during and after hospitalization. Hospitalization can be psychologically traumatic for children. Few research studies have studied the role of the design of the hospital environment in mitigating that traumatic experience. The study employs a two-group posttest and follow-up design to compare the impact of hospitalization on child anxiety and parent stress. It compares the experiences of children (ages 3-17) hospitalized at a new facility designed to support child-centered care and with family-friendly features with an older facility that did not have these features. The new facility was a replacement of the old one, so that many challenges to comparison are addressed. Controlling for the facts of hospitalization, patient demographics, and the child's typical anxiety level, children in the new facility experienced less anxiety than in the old facility. The study does not provide evidence that the hospital design reduced the psychological sequelae of hospitalization. Parents and children found different features of the hospital to be restorative. The study supports the use of Ulrich's theory of supportive design to children's healthcare environments, though what is experienced as supportive design will vary by the developmental stage of the child.

Hospitals undergo constant renovation to meet the needs of the populations they serve. Relocating to a newly renovated care area can potentially impact patient safety through workflow process changes. Simulated patient care scenarios were used to assess functionality of equipment and staff orientation to a newly renovated ward. Additionally, staff confidence to provide safe patient care was assessed prior to patient relocation. All participating staff reported feeling confident in their ability to provide safe patient care within the newly renovated ward at the conclusion of the exercise. In this case study, the use of simulated patient care scenarios was successful to orientate staff to a new clinical space. Additionally, staff were able to identify workflow changes and access the functionality of newly installed equipment. This exercise allowed staff to gain confidence in their ability to provide safe patient care in a newly renovated area.

Intended for both researchers and practitioners, this article provides multiple perspectives on both reporting and evaluating high-quality qualitative research. Two popular reporting standards exist for reporting qualitative research-the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) and the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR). Though compiled using similar procedures, they differ in their criteria and the methods to which they apply. Creating and applying reporting criteria is inherently difficult due to the undefined and fluctuating nature of qualitative research when compared to quantitative studies. Qualitative research is expansive and occasionally controversial, spanning many different methods of inquiry and epistemological approaches. A \"one-size-fits-all\" standard for reporting qualitative research can be restrictive, but COREQ and SRQR both serve as valuable tools for developing responsible qualitative research proposals, effectively communicating research decisions, and evaluating submissions. Ultimately, tailoring a set of standards specific to health design research and its frequently used methods would ensure quality research and aid reviewers in their evaluations.

Patient falls continue to be a critical concern for healthcare providers, patients, and families. While substantial literature exist on intrinsic factors, scientific evidence on the role of the physical environment is scarce. Expanded analysis of data from 180 videos of trials conducted in a physical mock-up of a medical-surgical inpatient room in a previously completed study phase. The odds of subject's exhibited postures (predictors) on fall initiation (outcome) were examined in a series of generalized linear mixed effects models. Physical design elements and attributes associated with postures exhibiting statistical significance were examined. Turning, pulling, pushing, and bending forward exhibited the highest odds of contributing to fall initiation in the bathroom. Grabbing, pushing, and sitting exhibited the highest odds of contributing to fall initiation around the patient bed. Physical design elements\/attributes associated with the above postures are the (1) bathroom door; (2) bathroom spatial configuration-relative locations of door, toilet bowl, and the sink; (3) door, toilet, and sink hardware; (4) space availability\/tightness inside the clinician zone; and (5) spatial configuration around patient bed-relative locations of bed, patient chair, and overbed table, in relation to bathroom door, and resulting obstructions originating from the configuration. Patient falls during unassisted ambulation may be reduced through appropriate examination of these five physical elements\/attributes. ","336":"This study utilizes systems theory to understand how changes to physical design structures impact communication processes and patient and staff design-related outcomes. Many scholars and researchers have noted the importance of communication and teamwork for patient care quality. Few studies have examined changes to nursing station design within a systems theory framework. This study employed a multimethod, before-and-after, quasi-experimental research design. Nurses completed surveys in centralized units and later in decentralized units ( N = 26pre, N = 51post). Patients completed surveys ( N = 62pre) in centralized units and later in decentralized units ( N = 49post). Surveys included quantitative measures and qualitative open-ended responses. Patients preferred the decentralized units because of larger single-occupancy rooms, greater privacy\/confidentiality, and overall satisfaction with design. Nurses had a more complex response. Nurses approved the patient rooms, unit environment, and noise levels in decentralized units. However, they reported reduced access to support spaces, lower levels of team\/mentoring communication, and less satisfaction with design than in centralized units. Qualitative findings supported these results. Nurses were more positive about centralized units and patients were more positive toward decentralized units. The results of this study suggest a need to understand how system components operate in concert. A major contribution of this study is the inclusion of patient satisfaction with design, an important yet overlooked fact in patient satisfaction. Healthcare design researchers and practitioners may consider how changing system interdependencies can lead to unexpected changes to communication processes and system outcomes in complex systems. ","337":"To explore the use of a rehabilitation-focused behavioral mapping method to identify changes in patient physical activity, location, and social interaction following the relocation of a rehabilitation ward. Rehabilitation wards are unique healthcare environments where patient activity is encouraged to improve recovery. Little is known about the impact of building design on patient behavior within a rehabilitation setting. We examined this issue when a rehabilitation ward was relocated without altering other aspects of the healthcare service. The setting was a publicly funded inpatient general rehabilitation ward with a separate therapy area. Before and after ward relocation, patient behavior (location, physical, and social activities) was observed at 10-min intervals between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Patients and staff performed their usual activities during data collection. Twenty-three patients participated in the old ward and 24 in the new ward, resulting in 1,150 and 1,200 observation time points, respectively. Patient location and behaviors were similar between wards ( p &gt; .05). Participants were in bedrooms for more than half of the observations (67% old ward, 58% new ward), sitting down (62.8% old ward, 59.0% new ward), and alone (42.0% old ward, 38.0% new ward). Design features, such as separation of the therapy area and ward, may have impacted on patient behavior. The rehabilitation-focused behavioral mapping method provided a rich description of relevant patient behaviors, indicating that it is a feasible and useful method for exploring the impact of the built environment in rehabilitation settings.

Attention is focusing on ways of improving the physical environment to optimize health outcomes and staff efficiency. This article explores the effects of the physical environment in three acute care settings: acute hospital site, in-patient rehabilitation hospital, and intermediate care provision (a nursing home with some beds dedicated to intermediate care) chosen to represent different steps on the acute care pathway for older people and gain the perspectives of patients, family carers, and staff. Semi structured interviews were undertaken with 40 patient\/carer dyads (where available) and three staff focus groups were conducted in each care setting with a range of staff. Multiple aspects of the physical environment were reported as important by patients, family carers, and staff. For example, visitors stressed the importance of access and parking, patients valued environments where privacy and dignity were protected, storage space was poor across all sites, and security was important to patients but visitors want easy access to wards. The physical environment is a significant component of acute care for older people, many of whom are also frail, but often comes second to organization of care, or relationships between actors in an episode of care.

While healthcare has primarily focused on fixing the body, there is a growing recognition that our healthcare system could do more by promoting overall wellness, and this requires expanding the focus to healing. This article explores how we can extend what we know from EBD about health impacts of spatial design to the more elusive goal of healing. By breaking the concept of healing into antecedent components (emotional, psychological, social, behavioral, and functional), this review of the literature presents the existing evidence to identify how healthcare spaces can foster healing. The environmental variables found to directly affect or facilitate one or more dimension of healing were organized into six groups of variables-homelike environment, access to views and nature, light, noise control, barrier-free environment, and room layout. While there is limited scientific research confirming design solutions for creating healing spaces, the literature search revealed relationships that provide a basis for a draft definition. Healing spaces evoke a sense of cohesion of the mind, body, and spirit. They support healing intention and foster healing relationships.","341":"This article presents a pilot study that employed a user-centered methodology for evaluating and quantifying neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) designs based on the needs of the primary users. The design of NICUs has begun to shift from open-bay to single-family rooms. Both designs present unique advantages and challenges that impact babies, families, and caregivers. One NICU design was analyzed using the functional scenario (FS) analysis method. For the FS, users' needs were determined through literature review, interviews with NICU providers and parents, and a review of published design guidelines. Quantitative metrics were developed for each FS, so that characteristics of the NICU design could be analyzed to determine how successful they were in meeting the users' needs. The results were graphically represented to visualize the success and considerations of the design. A total of 23 FSs and 61 spatial metrics were developed. FSs for babies focused on infection prevention, minimizing exposure to environmental stimuli, and supporting enriching care activities. FSs for family members focused on direct access to the baby, and privacy and adequate space for daily activities. FSs for providers and caregivers focused on infection prevention, care activities, care zones, and visibility. Using an FS approach highlights design characteristics in the NICU that need to be addressed during the design process to more successfully meet the needs of the different users. Additionally, using this approach can inform design professionals' decision-making by presenting them with the design characteristics that impact the needs of the user groups.

The impact of building features that promote wellness is of increasing interest to the building owners, designers, and occupants. This study performed a postoccupancy evaluation of two user groups at a healthcare facility with specific wellness features. Seventy-six staff and 62 patients of a cancer center were polled separately to determine their preferences in 11 categories. Results showed that all wellness features were viewed favorably by the two groups, with natural lighting, views of nature, and thermal comfort as top categories for both. The t-test comparisons were performed, and significant differences ( p &lt; .05) between the two groups were found for three of the features (views of nature, art and murals, and indoor plants). Discussion of these differences and the interaction of competing design goals (thermal comfort, views of nature, natural light, and desire for privacy) are included. Designers and owners will want to consider the preferred use of roof gardens, art and murals, and indoor plants for patient spaces, where their relative value is greater. Access to private and quiet spaces is the top need for caregivers. Ease of movement, thermal comfort, and natural light were top needs for patients.

Environments for cancer chemotherapy care are outpatient settings, and recommendations based on findings regarding inpatient settings may not be appropriate. Users of chemotherapy treatment environments include cancer patients, their families, and nursing staff. A questionnaire survey was conducted in an academic cancer center in Louisiana. The participants included 171 cancer patients, 145 family members, and 16 nursing staff members. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. Participants' environmental preferences were compared using analysis of variance. Reasons for preferences were analyzed through key word and content analysis. Semi-open areas were preferred by the staff, whereas the three types of treatment environments were equally popular among both patients and families (preferred by 29%\/28%\/27% of the participants). Female patients and patients receiving longer periods of treatment per occurrence were more likely to prefer private rooms ( p &lt; .05). Three common reasons for preferences were needs for privacy, social interaction, and patient-nurse access. Additional reasons for patient and family preferences included needs for sleep, openness, and access to nature. A shared environment of chemotherapy care was suggested to be appropriate for four to seven patients to occupy. Multiple types of treatment environments should be provided in chemotherapy care to incorporate varied user needs. Privacy, social interaction, patient-nurse access, and access to nature should be considered during the design of environments for cancer chemotherapy.

Previous research suggests the importance of the office space in clinical practice in regard to therapeutic alliance, client behavior, and the well-being of the therapist. However, therapist offices contain much variation in design. This study looked further into specifically how the therapy room is important through the perspective of the licensed clinical social workers in order to identify common themes. Seven licensed clinical social workers in private psychotherapy practice were interviewed in their offices. Phenomenological research methods were used to explore and analyze their experiences. While the offices contained many physical differences, the intentions behind the designs were similar. Three themes emerged regarding how participants used and designed their spaces. First, participants used their offices to provide care for clients and themselves. Second, participants used their spaces to communicate therapeutic messages and to reveal and\/or conceal aspects of themselves. Third, participants also used their space in direct practice. This phenomenological study provided insight into the importance and use of the psychotherapy office space. These findings may be helpful for therapists designing or redesigning their own practice spaces.

The review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Databases searched included MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus. Supplemental searches were performed. We included studies reporting patient outcomes or user opinion related to SPRs. Appraisal was conducted using a dual appraisal system of evidence levels and methodological quality. Forty-three studies qualified for appraisal. Three were excluded due to methodological quality (no appraisal score). One study was appraised for three individual outcomes (i.e., falls, infections, and user opinion). Eleven studies with low methodological quality scores were not included in the narrative synthesis. Overall, 87% of studies reported advantages associated with SPRs (some a combination of advantages and disadvantages or a combination of advantages and neutral results). Outcomes with the best evidence of benefit include communication, infection control, noise reduction\/perceived sleep quality, and preference\/perception. SPRs seem to result in more advantages than disadvantages. However, healthcare is a complex adaptive system, and decisions for 100% SPRs should be reviewed alongside related issues, such as necessary workflow modifications, unit configuration and other room layout decisions, patient populations, staffing models, and inherent trade-offs (e.g., the advantages of privacy compared to disadvantage of isolation).

Cancer is considered a chronic disease in the United States, and more than 1.6 million new cases are diagnosed annually. New strategies of cancer care propose patient-centered services to achieve the best outcome, and researchers have found that environmental design can be an important part of improving this care. Searches were conducted in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases as well as in specific healthcare design journals such as Health Environments Research &amp; Design, Environmental Psychology, and Environment and Behavior. The criteria for articles included in the review were (a) English-language articles related to facility design, which addressed (b) the topics of built environment in relation to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship, and were (c) published in peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2017. Finally, 10 articles were selected, and the contents were analyzed. The selected articles demonstrate that environmental design is one of the critical factors for success throughout the whole continuum of cancer care from diagnosis to end-of-treatment. Some of the specific conclusions from the review are that \"neighborhood-oriented\" design strategies can be beneficial (by providing accessibility to all facilities along the patient's path), that access to nature for patients, staff, and visitors alike is associated with better outcomes, and that provisions for natural lighting and noise reduction are associated with cancer patients' well-being.","349":"The main purpose of this research was to identify significant relationships between environmental hazards and older adults' falling. Falls can present a major health risk to older persons. Identifying potential environmental hazards that increase fall risks can be effective for developing fall prevention strategies that can create safer residential environments for older adults. The research included a retrospective analysis of 449 fall incident reports in two case-control buildings. In the homes of 88 older adults residing in independent living, an observational study was conducted to identify environmental hazards using two assessment tools including Westmead Home Safety Assessment (WeHSA) and resident interviews. A fall history analysis indicated that falls occurred in the bathroom were significantly associated with hospitalization. The observational study revealed that the bathroom was the most common place for environmental hazards. The research showed, with increasing age and use of mobility assistive aids, there was a corresponding increase in the total number of environmental hazards. Home hazards were significantly and independently associated with the incidence rate of falls. In other words, the high fall rate building included more environmental hazards compared to the low fall rate building while controlling for residents' age and mobility. The current study provides empirical evidence of the link between environmental hazards and older adults' falling, which is useful for developing effective fall intervention design strategies.

The CN plays a significant role in promoting patient safety during surgical procedures by observing, monitoring, and managing potential threats at and around the surgical field. Their work requires constant movement to different parts of the OR to support team members. The layout of the OR and crowded and cluttered environment might impact the CN's workflow and cause disruptions during the surgery. A convenience sample of 25 surgeries were video recorded and thematically coded for CN's activities, locations, and flow disruptions. The OR layout was categorized into transitional zones and functional zones (workstations, supply zones, support zones, and sterile areas around the surgical table). CN's activities were classified into patient-, equipment-, material-, and information-related activities. Flow disruptions included those related to environmental hazards and layout. The CN traveled through multiple zones during 91% of the activities. The CN's workstation acted as a main hub from which the CN made frequent trips to both sides of the surgical table, the foot of the OR table, supply zones, and support zones. Transitional zones accounted for 58.3% of all flow disruption that the CN was involved in whereas 28% occurred in areas surrounding the OR bed. The similarity of the movement and flow disruption patterns, despite variations in OR layout, highlighted the adjacencies required between major zones that CNs regularly visit. These optimum adjacencies should be considered while designing ORs such that they are more efficient and safer.

SLR provides a way to assess the quality level and magnitude of existing evidence on a question or topic of interest. It offers a broader and more accurate level of understanding than a traditional literature review. A systematic review adheres to standardized methodologies\/guidelines in systematic searching, filtering, reviewing, critiquing, interpreting, synthesizing, and reporting of findings from multiple publications on a topic\/domain of interest. The Cochrane Collaboration is the most well-known and widely respected global organization producing SLRs within the healthcare field and a standard to follow for any researcher seeking to write a transparent and methodologically sound SLR.

In high reliability, complex industries, macrocognition is an approach to develop new knowledge among interprofessional team members. Although macrocognitive functions have been analyzed in multiple healthcare settings, the effect of the HCBE on those functions has not been directly studied. The theoretical framework, \"macrocognition in the healthcare built environment\" (mHCBE) addresses this relationship. A focused ethnographic study was conducted including observation and focus groups. Architectural drawing files used to create distance matrices and isovist field view analyses were compared to panoramic photographs and ethnographic data. Neighborhoods comprised of corner configurations with maximized visibility enhanced team interactions as well as observation of patients, offering the greatest opportunity for informal situated macrocognitive interactions (SMIs). Results from this study support the intricate link between macrocognitive interactions and space syntax constructs within the HCBE.

","358":"The aim of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of visually impaired older people living independently at home. As populations are aging globally, there is now an increase in the prevalence of visual impairment. That means for ongoing and future aging-in-place strategies that seek to enable older people to remain independent for longer, more attention needs to be given to the needs of those with visual impairment. As people develop visual impairment, they use adaptive strategies including modifying long-term homes or relocating to more suitable accommodation. In the United Kingdom, aging-in-place strategies include employing statutory lifetime home standards (LTHS) in the home or relocating to sheltered housing to live independently with support available if required. To get a better understanding of the needs of the visually impaired in the home, 12 interviews with six visually impaired occupants of LTHS homes and six from sheltered accommodation were analyzed separately using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Secondly, qualitative synthesis was used to further analyze themes generated from both samples before interview results were conceptualized in two superordinate concepts, namely, \"negotiating priorities\" and \"understanding visual impairment.\" Participants from both groups had similar needs and were willing to compromise by living with some negative features. Those who coped well with moving utilized various resources. These findings will shed more understanding on providing good quality housing for those with visual impairment wanting to live either independently or within healthcare home environments.

The rationale was to gain practical insight for delineating relevant and translatable nature-based care and design opportunities in oncology contexts. Innovative cancer care services are needed to respond to growing demand and shifting healthcare needs. Engagement with nature has shown multiple health benefits and presents a promising opportunity for application in healthcare to improve outcomes. Qualitative research design using content analysis was used. Eligible adults with any cancer diagnosis participated in semistructured and audio-recorded interviews. Transcribed textual data included responses to two open-ended questions querying about participants' recommendations related to nature-based opportunities in the cancer setting. Deductive analysis used three predetermined categories: \"recommendation: features,\" \"recommendation: functions,\" and \"cautions.\" Twenty patients with cancer (nine female) participated. Broad recommendations incorporated (1) using nature for vital sensory stimulation and engagement, (2) using nature for personal space and freedom to enable private and social exploration, (3) using views to nature for distraction and comfort, and (4) accessing nature for physical activity and movement. Three critical factors were determined for avoiding adverse experiences: determining appropriate expenditure and resourcing, selection of appropriate nature-based design materials, and exercising caution around demanding nature engagement and harsh weather conditions. Cancer patients' recommendations reveal the importance of engaging with nature in their experiences of health and recovery. The findings can inform planning appropriate and safe integration of beneficial nature engagement in cancer settings and support services.

In healthcare settings, such as rehabilitation units, corridors have often been designed simply as spaces allowing movement between other locations. However, research suggests that corridors may be places where important social and care-related activities take place. How corridors are used and understood by patients and staff in inpatient rehabilitation settings is unclear, and a greater understanding of the role of corridors in these settings could help to inform more supportive design of these spaces. Independent observations of user activity were conducted at a major metropolitan inpatient spinal injury unit (SIU) and brain injury unit (BIU). Interviews were conducted with SIU patients ( n = 12), and focus groups were conducted with SIU staff ( n = 23), BIU patients ( n = 12), and BIU staff ( n = 10). Results from the observations showed that the corridors were used frequently across the day, particularly by staff. Thematic analysis of staff and patient experiences found three key themes describing how corridors were used: (1) moving around, (2) delivery and experiences of quality care, and (3) a \"spillover space.\" Results demonstrate that corridors not only have an important role as connective spaces but are also used as flexible, multipurpose spaces for delivery of quality care and patient experiences. Future design should consider how these spaces can more deliberately support and contribute to patient and staff experiences of rehabilitation.

This research explored whether with high visibility in EDs, teamwork and collaborative communication can be improved while the security issues will be reduced. Visibility has been regarded as a critical design consideration and can be directly and considerably impacted by ED's physical design. Teamwork is one of the major related operational outcomes of visibility and involves nurses, support staff, and physicians. The collaborative communication in an ED is another important factor in the process of care delivery and affects efficiency and safety. Furthermore, security is a behavioral factor in ED designs, which includes all types of safety including staff safety, patient safety, and the safety of visitors and family members. This qualitative study investigated the impact of visibility on teamwork, collaborative communication, and security issues in the ED. One-on-one interviews and on-site observation sessions were conducted in a community hospital. Corresponding data analysis was implemented by using computer plan analysis, observation and interview content, and theme analyses. The findings of this exploratory study provided a framework to identify visibility as an influential factor in ED design. High levels of visibility impact productivity and efficiency of teamwork and communication and improve the chance of lowering security issues.

Small groups of patients and caregivers toured two of the five rooms and provided verbal and written evaluations of room features. A grounded theory approach was employed to generate a codebook, identify the frequency of codes, and to group codes and memos into emerging themes. Insights from emergent themes were compared with findings from written surveys on the importance of various room design elements completed at the beginning of each session. A theoretical design framework was generated, showing patients expect a hospital room that provides them with the core components of comfort to support healing, facilitates a strong sense of connection to people and the outside world, enables quick and independent access to the patient's things, and offers suitable levels of control to the patient throughout their hospital stay. The implications for assisting architects, healthcare planners, and interior space designers are described using this framework, as well as its potential for design guidance.

In a repeated measures design, 16 older people (aged 72-99 years) living in a care home had their personal light exposure and sleep\/wake patterns monitored for 4 days. Cognitive ability, mental well-being, daytime physical activity, and visual function were assessed. Mean light levels at preset times across the day, duration in light exposure over 1,000 lux, and sleep parameters were computed. Statistical investigations included correlations exploring associations and paired means tests to detect the changes between seasons. The mean morning illuminance level in summer was 466 lux and 65 lux in winter. Duration in bright light over 1,000 lux was 46 min in summer and 3 min in winter. Light measures were significantly higher in summer. There was no statistical difference in sleep quality parameters between seasons, but there were significant difference in daytime physical activity level (i.e., this was higher in summer). The findings indicate low level of light exposures experienced in both seasons, with exposure levels being particularly low in winter. This provides new insights into the limited amount of light older people receive independent of season and the possible impacts on sleep and daytime physical activity level.

This article highlights the obstacles to overcoming this knowledge deficit in the pursuit of evidence-based guidelines to inform social provisions within the pediatric hospital setting. It will propose a working definition for psychosocial space and identify new research directions to enhance understandings of the relationship between social space and well-being. While traditional multibed ward configurations afforded opportunities for peer support relationships to develop, both for patients and caregivers, the contemporary preference for single-occupancy rooms intensifies the need to critically examine social spaces within the pediatric hospital. Research suggests a correlation between social support and well-being. This article reviews the research underpinning contemporary understandings of this relationship; it positions literature from sociology, environmental psychology, and evidence-based design to highlight the limitations of this knowledge and identify where additional research is required to inform evidence-based design guidelines for psychosocially supportive spaces within pediatric healthcare settings. Evidence regarding the therapeutic value of social support within the pediatric hospital is not sufficiently sophisticated or conclusive to inform guidelines for the provision of social space with pediatric hospitals. There is an urgent need for targeted research to inform evidence-based design guidelines; this will demand a broad disciplinary approach.

There are no published systematic reviews on the current topic. Searches were conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar databases in addition to targeted design journals including Health Environmental Research &amp; Design, Environment and Behavior, Environmental Psychology, and Applied Ergonomics. Inclusion criteria were (a) full-text English language articles related to teamwork and communication and (b) involving any healthcare built environment and space design published in peer-reviewed journals between 1984 and 2017. Studies were extracted using defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the first phase, 26 of the 195 articles most relevant to teamwork and 19 studies of the 147 were identified and reviewed to understand the impact of communication in healthcare facilities. The literature regarding the impact of built environment on teamwork and communication were reviewed and explored in detail. Eighteen studies were selected and succinctly summarized as the final product of this review. Environmental design, which involves nurses, support staff, and physicians, is one of the critical factors that promotes the efficiency of teamwork and collaborative communication. Layout design, visibility, and accessibility levels are the most cited aspects of design which can affect the level of communication and teamwork in healthcare facilities.","370":"To investigate how product design can be used to improve parent-infant bonding in a neonatal intensive care unit. Impaired parent-infant bonding is an inevitable consequence of premature birth, which negatively influences development. Products, systems, or services that support the bonding process might counter these negative influences. The first step was to trace existing products by performing a literature search in PubMed, the university library, and Google. The identified existing designs were then used in semistructured interviews with nurses and parents to get insights into their desires and recommendations for product design to enhance bonding. Interviews contained open questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire based on the literature search. In total, 17 existing design types were used in interviews with 11 parents and 23 nurses. All nurses explicitly stated that practicality was the first criterion designs aimed at enhancing bonding definitely had to meet. All parents indicated that they would like to use a design to enhance bonding if that would contribute to their child's health and development. For both parents and nurses, the most valuable way to enhance bonding seemed to be products to improve Kangaroo care; however, their specific desires varied substantially. Therefore, seven recurring themes were defined, resulting in nine general recommendations and six opportunities intended to enhance parent-infant bonding. This study provides design recommendations and opportunities based on parents' and nurses' expert opinions. Designing to enhance bonding is considered valuable; however, designs should match the stakeholders' desires and conditions. ","371":"This study aims to identify the behavioral and environmental strategies that healthcare workers view as helpful for managing sleepiness, improving alertness, and therefore optimizing workplace safety. Reduced alertness is a common issue in healthcare work environments and is associated with impaired cognitive performance and decision-making ability as well as increased errors and injuries. We surveyed 136 healthcare professionals at a primary care clinic, an acute care hospital, and a mental health clinic. Nonstructured, semistructured, and structured questionnaires were used to elicit relevant information which was analyzed using qualitative content analysis and logistic regression models, respectively. In order by frequency of endorsement: dietary intervention; physical mobility; cognitive, sensory, or social stimulation; personal lifestyle strategies; and rest\/nap opportunities were reported as behavioral strategies used to address workplace alertness. Compared to other environmental features, daylight and thermal comfort were perceived to be more important to addressing workplace alertness ( p &lt; .05). By optimizing the physical environment and organizational policies and providing education programs, we have an opportunity to support healthcare professionals in managing sleepiness and maintaining alertness at work. In addition, such system level interventions may reduce unhealthy choices such as frequent caffeine intake to keep alert. The development of multidisciplinary evidence-based guidelines is needed to address sleepiness and alertness to improve workplace safety in healthcare facilities. ","372":"The purpose of this study was to understand how two different ambulatory design modules-traditional and onstage\/offstage-impact operational efficiency, patient throughput, staff collaboration, and patient privacy. Delivery of healthcare is greatly shifting to ambulatory settings because of rapid advancement of medicine and technology, resulting in more day procedures and follow-up care occurring outside of hospitals. It is anticipated that outpatient services will grow roughly 15-23% within the next 10 years (Sg2, 2014). Nonetheless, there is limited research that evaluates how the built environment impacts care delivery and patient outcomes. This is a cross-sectional, comparative study consisted of a mixed-method approach that included shadowing clinic staff and observing and surveying patients. The linear module had shared corridors and publicly exposed workstations, whereas the onstage\/offstage module separates patient\/visitors from staff with dedicated patient corridors leading to exam rooms (onstage) and enclosed staff work cores (offstage). Roughly 35 hr of clinic staff shadowing and 55 hr of patient observations occurred. A total of 269 questionnaires were completed by patients\/visitors. The results demonstrate that the onstage\/offstage module significantly improved staff workflow, reduced travel distances, increased communication in private areas, and significantly reduced patient throughput and wait times. However, patients' perception of privacy did not change among the two modules. Compared to the linear module, this study provides evidence that the onstage\/offstage module could have helped to optimize operational efficiencies, staff workflow, and patient throughput. ","373":"To identify the optimal spatial and dimensional requirements of grab bars that support independent and assisted transfers by older adults and their care providers. Although research has demonstrated that toilet grab bars based on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Standards do not meet the needs of older adults, the specific dimensional requirements for alternative configurations are unknown. A two-phased study with older adults and care providers in residential facilities was conducted to determine the optimal requirements for grab bars. Seniors and caregivers in skilled nursing facilities performed transfers using a mock-up toilet. In Phase 1, participants evaluated three grab bar configurations to identify optimal characteristics for safety, ease of use, comfort, and helpfulness. These characteristics were then validated for using ability-matched samples in Phase 2. The optimal configuration derived in Phase 1 included fold-down grab bars on both sides of the toilet (14\" from centerline [CL] of toilet, 32\" above the floor, and extended a minimum of 6\" in front of the toilet) with one side open and a sidewall 24\" from CL of toilet on the other. Phase 2 feedback was significantly positive for independent and one-person transfers and somewhat lower, albeit still positive, for two-person transfers. The study provides substantial evidence that bilateral grab bars are significantly more effective than those that comply with current ADA Accessibility Standards. Findings provide specific spatial and dimensional attributes for grab bar configurations that would be most effective in senior facilities.

New evidence exists since the 2006 Facility Guideline Institute guideline recommended single-bedded rooms (SBRs) in low-acuity care settings. Additionally, prior studies evaluated high-acuity care settings (e.g., critical care) in their recommendations on SBRs. There is a need to reevaluate the evidence. A systematic review of the literature was completed including electronic and hand searches of references. A data extraction form was utilized. Two reviewers evaluated the studies independently. Studies that were included examined the effect of single-patient rooms on medical surgical ward beds only. Each study was graded using accepted clinical evidence grading instruments. Over 1,400 records were identified. After excluding studies, a total of 49 records were graded. The highest quality evidence identified (Center for Evidence-Based Medicine [CEBM]: 2a, 2b, and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation [GRADE] C) did not support the use of single-patient rooms for reducing infections, for minimizing patient falls, for reducing medication errors, or for patient satisfaction. Operational efficiencies were improved with SBRs but only addressed the maternity ward. The lowest quality evidence (CEBM: 4\/5 and GRADE D) supported the use of single-patient rooms. Based on CEBM and GRADE assessments, there is a lack of high-quality data supporting the use of low-acuity SBRs throughout the entire hospital. Furthermore, it is recommended that more research be conducted on the effect of SBRs, so higher quality evidence is developed. ","377":"","378":"This article proposes an approach to help designers analyze complex care processes and identify the optimal layout of an emergency department (ED) considering several objectives simultaneously. These objectives include minimizing the distances traveled by patients, maximizing design preferences, and minimizing the relocation costs. Rising demand for healthcare services leads to increasing demand for new hospital buildings as well as renovating existing ones. Operations management techniques have been successfully applied in both manufacturing and service industries to design more efficient layouts. However, high complexity of healthcare processes makes it challenging to apply these techniques in healthcare environments. Process mining techniques were applied to address the problem of complexity and to enhance healthcare process analysis. Process-related information, such as information about the clinical pathways, was extracted from the information system of an ED. A goal programming approach was then employed to find a single layout that would simultaneously satisfy several objectives. The layout identified using the proposed method improved the distances traveled by noncritical and critical patients by 42.2% and 47.6%, respectively, and minimized the relocation costs. This study has shown that an efficient placement of the clinical units yields remarkable improvements in the distances traveled by patients.

In a previous study, authors explored the effect on individuals with Alzheimer's disease of viewing an indoor Japanese garden at a nursing home in the United States and reported that viewing the garden significantly reduced the heart rate, evoked short-term and long-term memories, and improved behavioral symptoms. However, it was unclear whether these effects were caused by the design of Japanese garden or unfamiliarity of the design to Caucasians. We constructed a Japanese garden on the rooftop of a hospital in Japan and assessed with a total of 25 subjects on the following categories: (1) eye movement, (2) heart rate, and (3) behavior under four different conditions: (a) open view of the site before construction of the Japanese garden (the control space), (b) open view of the Japanese garden, (c) view of the Japanese garden through closed door, and (d) view of Japanese garden through closed door with the chrysanthemum scent. Findings\/Results: Viewers' eyes scanned larger area while viewing the Japanese garden, and viewing the Japanese garden significantly reduced heart rate and improved behavioral symptoms than the control space. We also found that the effect of viewing the same Japanese garden differed across three conditions: the view through an open door, a closed door, and a closed door with added scent.

In addition, we present a taxonomy that illustrates the wide range of terms used in connection with design quality in healthcare. High-quality physical environments can promote health and well-being. Developments in healthcare technology and methodology put high demands on the design quality of care environments, coupled with increasing expectations and demands from patients and staff that care environments be person centered, welcoming, and accessible while also supporting privacy and security. In addition, there are demands that decisions about the design of healthcare architecture be based on the best available information from credible research and the evaluation of existing building projects. The basic principles of Arksey and O'Malley's model of scoping review design were used. Data were derived from literature searches in scientific databases. A total of 18 articles and books were found that referred to design quality in a healthcare context. Design quality of physical healthcare environments involves three different themes: (i) environmental sustainability and ecological values, (ii) social and cultural interactions and values, and (iii) resilience of the engineering and building construction. Design quality was clarified herein with a definition. Awareness of what is considered design quality in relation to healthcare architecture could help to design healthcare environments based on evidence. To operationalize the concept, its definition must be clear and explicit and able to meet the complex needs of the stakeholders in a healthcare context, including patients, staff, and significant others. ","386":"This study aimed to explore people's visual preference for waiting areas in general hospital environments designed with transparency attributes that fully integrate nature. Waiting can be a tedious and frustrating experience among people seeking healthcare treatments and negatively affect their perception of the quality of care. Positive distractions and supportive designs have gained increasing attraction to improve people's waiting experience. Nature, which has shown therapeutic effects according to a growing amount of evidence, could be a distinguished positive distraction in waiting areas. Additionally, the theory of transparency was operationalized to indicate a spatial continuity between the external nature and the built interiors in general healthcare waiting area design. A survey method was adopted in the study. Twenty-one images of general healthcare waiting areas depicting three design typologies were preselected following a strict procedure, including designs with (a) no window views, (b) limited window views to nature, and (c) transparent spaces with maximum natural views. Ninety-five student participants rated the images based on their visual preference using a Likert-type scale. The results showed that transparent waiting areas were significantly preferred. A significant positive relationship existed between the level of transparency and people's preference scores. The factor analysis indicated additional supportive features that may affect people's preferences, including daylight, perceived warmth, noninstitutional furniture arrangement, visual orientation, and the use of natural materials for interior design. However, these tentative results need to be furthered tested with the real patient population as the next step of this study. ","387":"This case study explores the influence of the healthcare design studio experience on students' short-term professional goals as measured through rates of healthcare-related certification and internship\/employment. The value and relevance of interior design is evident in the healthcare design sector. However, interior design students may not perceive this value if it is not communicated through their design education. Students' experience in the design studio plays a crucial role in determining career choices, and students may be more committed to career goals when there is clear connection between major coursework and professional practice. The authors compared healthcare-related certification and internship\/employment levels between two student cohorts in a capstone undergraduate interior design healthcare design studio course. The first cohort was led by the existing curriculum. The second cohort was led by the revised curriculum that specifically aimed at encouraging students to commit to healthcare-related design practice. When measured at 3 months from graduation, the second cohort, led by the revised curriculum, saw a 30% increase in Evidence-based Design Accreditation and Certification exam pass rates and a 40% increase in healthcare-related internship\/employment. The challenge of interior design education is to instill in emerging professionals not only professional competence but also those professional attitudes that will make them better prepared to design spaces that improve quality of life, particularly in healthcare environments. The results exceeded the project goals, and so this could be considered a promising practice for courses focused on healthcare design education. ","388":"Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) remain one of the few areas in hospitals that still use an open bay (OPBY) design for patient stays greater than 24 hr, housing multiple infants, staff, and families in one large room. This creates high noise levels, contributes to the spread of infection, and affords families little privacy. These problems have given rise to the single-family room NICU. This represents a significant change in the care environment for nurses. This literature review answers the question: When compared to OPBY layout, how does a single family room layout impact neonatal nurses' work? Thirteen studies published between 2006 and 2015 were located. Many studies reported both positive and negative effects on nurses' work and were therefore sorted by their cited advantages and disadvantages. Advantages included improved quality of the physical environment; improved quality of patient care; improved parent interaction; and improvements in nurse job satisfaction, stress, and burnout. Disadvantages included decreased interaction among the NICU patient care team, increased nurse workload, decreased visibility on the unit, and difficult interactions with family. This review suggests that single-family room NICUs introduce a complex situation in which trade-offs occur for nurses, most prominently the trade-off between visibility and privacy. Additionally, the literature is clear on what elements of nurses' work are impacted, but how the built environment influences these elements, and how these elements interact during nurses' work, is not as well understood. The current level of research and directions for future research are also discussed.","389":"Research supports therapeutic use of nature scenes in healthcare settings, particularly to reduce stress. However, limited literature is available to provide a cohesive guide for selecting scenes that may provide optimal therapeutic effect. This study produced and tested a replicable process for selecting nature scenes with therapeutic potential. Psychoevolutionary theory informed the construction of the Importance for Survival Scale (IFSS), and its usefulness for identifying scenes that people generally prefer to view and that hold potential to reduce stress was tested. Relationships between Importance for Survival (IFS), preference, and restoration were tested. General community participants ( N = 20 males, 20 females; M age = 48 years) Q-sorted sets of landscape photographs (preranked by the researcher in terms of IFS using the IFSS) from most to least preferred, and then completed the Short-Version Revised Restoration Scale in response to viewing a selection of the scenes. Results showed significant positive relationships between IFS and each of scene preference (large effect), and restoration potential (medium effect), as well as between scene preference and restoration potential across the levels of IFS (medium effect), and for individual participants and scenes (large effect). IFS was supported as a framework for identifying nature scenes that people will generally prefer to view and that hold potential for restoration from emotional distress; however, greater therapeutic potential may be expected when people can choose which of the scenes they would prefer to view. Evidence for the effectiveness of the IFSS was produced. ","390":"This review of empirical literature focuses on the design of operating rooms (ORs) by investigating the physical environmental features of ORs associated with patient and staff outcomes. Many ORs built more than 30 years ago remain operational today. However, most are inadequately designed to handle the equipment, processes, and people that a contemporary OR needs to accommodate. However, the evidence base for designing ORs has been sorely lacking, and little guidance exists on how OR design can improve safety and performance outcomes. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and the university's linked databases. The inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed journal articles that reported some aspect of the physical environment of ORs along with outcomes. The study included empirical studies as well as nonempirical best practice papers. This literature review uncovered 211 articles. The main themes that emerged include OR design-related factors, ventilation, temperature and humidity, acoustical environment, lighting, and materials. Some environmental threats to patient safety in the OR include frequent door openings, clutter, poor air quality, surface contamination, and noise. Further, staff performance and satisfaction were impacted by factors such as the OR layout and equipment and furniture ergonomics. This literature review provides an overview of the research organized into design-focused topic areas to support decision-making by architects and designers. This article highlights gaps in the research and identifies areas where best practice and design assumptions need to be evaluated using rigorous design research.

Outpatient clinics play a critical role in the delivery of healthcare in rural settings in Appalachia. While the concept of patient participation in healthcare does not enjoy a widely adopted, standardized definition, it is believed that patients who are more actively engaged in their healthcare will potentially realize improved health outcomes. This study examines the role facility design could play in participation. A pilot qualitative study was conducted involving focus groups with a targeted elderly population of a rural outpatient clinic in southern West Virginia. The goal was to assess the perceptions of impacts of clinical design elements on participation. Patients identified and characterized 10 design-related elements they felt impacted participation. The design of the outpatient clinic has the potential to impact the level of engagement of patients in the healthcare process, thus providing another leverage point for improving population health in rural settings. ","392":"The focus of this research was to analyze the impact of decentralized and centralized hospital design layouts on the delivery of efficient care and the resultant level of caregiver satisfaction. An interdisciplinary team conducted a multiphased pre- and postoccupancy evaluation of a cardiovascular service line in an academic hospital that moved from a centralized to decentralized model. This study examined the impact of walkability, room usage, allocation of time, and visibility to better understand efficiency in the care environment. A mixed-methods data collection approach was utilized, which included pedometer measurements of staff walking distances, room usage data, time studies in patient rooms and nurses' stations, visibility counts, and staff questionnaires yielding qualitative and quantitative results. Overall, the data comparing the centralized and decentralized models yielded mixed results. This study's centralized design was rated significantly higher in its ability to support teamwork and efficient patient care with decreased staff walking distances. The decentralized unit design was found to positively influence proximity to patients in a larger design footprint and contribute to increased visits to and time spent in patient rooms. Among the factors contributing to caregiver efficiency and satisfaction are nursing station design, an integrated team approach, and the overall physical layout of the space on walkability, allocation of caregiver time, and visibility. However, unit design alone does not solely impact efficiency, suggesting that designers must consider the broader implications of a culture of care and processes. ","393":"This article provides critical examination and comparison of the conceptual meaning and underlying assumptions of the concepts evidence-based design (EBD) and research-informed design (RID) in order to facilitate practical use and theoretical development. In recent years, EBD has experienced broad adoption, yet it has been simultaneously critiqued for rigidity and misapplication. Many practitioners are gravitating to the term RID to describe their method of integrating knowledge into the design process. However, the term RID lacks a clear definition and the blurring of terms has the potential to weaken advances made integrating research into practice. Concept analysis methods from Walker and Avant were used to define the concepts for comparison. Conceptual definitions, process descriptions, examples (i.e., model cases), and methods of evaluation are offered for EBD and RID. Although EBD and RID share similarities in meaning, the two terms are distinct. When comparing evidence based (EB) and research informed, EB is a broad base of information types (evidence) that are narrowly applied (based), while the latter references a narrow slice of information (research) that is broadly applied (informed) to create an end product of design. Much of the confusion between the use of the concepts EBD and RID arises out of differing perspectives between the way practitioners and academics understand the underlying terms.

As designers, human factor experts, and healthcare professionals continue to work to integrate assistive human-robot technologies in healthcare, it is imperative to understand how the technology affects patient care from clinicians' perspectives. Fourteen clinical H-SMEs rated a subset of conceptual ART design ideas; participated in the iterative design process of ART; and evaluated a final cardboard prototype, the rehabilitation hospital's current over-the-bed table (OBT), an ART built with true materials, and two therapy surface prototypes. Four RD-SMEs conducted a heuristic evaluation on the ART built with true materials. Data were analyzed by frequency and content analysis. The results include a design and prototype for the next generation ART and a pneumatically controlled therapy surface, a broadened list of specifications for the future design and implementation of assistive robotic furniture, and final observations. When compared to the rehabilitation hospital's current OBT, the developed ART in this study was successful. Designing novel features is dependent upon ensuring patient safety.

The TVD process starts with the client defining an allowable cost that needs to be met by the design and construction teams. An expected cost in the TVD process is defined through multiple interactions between multiple stakeholders who define wishes and others who define ways of achieving these wishes. Finally, a target cost is defined based on the expected profit the design and construction teams are expecting to make. TVD follows a series of continuous improvement efforts aimed at reaching the desired goals for the project and its associated target value cost. The process takes advantage of rapid cycles of suggestions, analyses, and implementation that starts with the definition of value for the client. In the traditional design process, the goal is to identify user preferences and find solutions that meet the needs of the client's expressed preferences. In the lean design process, the goal is to educate users about their values and advocate for a better facility over the long run; this way owners can help contractors and designers to identify better solutions.

In addition to collecting data about the impact of these specific designs, the study provides a model for the broader implementation of POE approaches in the mental healthcare context. POEs in general healthcare settings have been shown to lead to better work environments and better outcomes for patients. Despite growing evidence of the value provided by POE studies, the industry has been somewhat slow to adopt their regular use, in part due to unfamiliarity with the POE process. This is particularly true in mental healthcare contexts, where POE studies remain virtually nonexistent. In-depth interviews and a widely distributed, anonymous survey were used to collect hospital staff perceptions and feedback regarding the impact of specific design features. The hospital staff were quite enthusiastic about two of the design innovations studied here (a new wayfinding strategy and the use of vibrant colors in specific areas of the facility). The third innovation, open-style communication centers, elicited more mixed evaluations. The results include extensive hypothesis testing about the effects of each innovation as well as narrative discussions of their pros and cons. The study generated new knowledge about three specific mental healthcare design innovations and provides a model for the practical implementation of a POE approach in mental healthcare contexts.

A sample of 467 participants (290 staff and 177 clients or community stakeholders) completed the DCE. Latent class analysis identified three segments with different design preferences. A group we termed an enhanced design (57%) segment preferred a fully featured facility with personal contacts at the start of visits (in-person check-in, personal waiting room notification, volunteer-assisted wayfinding, and visible security), a family resource center with a health librarian, and an outdoor playground equipped with covered heated pathways. The self-guided design segment (11%), in contrast, preferred a design allowing a more independent use of the facility (e.g., self-check-in at computer kiosks, color-coded wayfinding, and a self-guided family resource center). Designs affording privacy and personal contact with staff were important to the private design segment (32%). The theme and decor of the building was less important than interactive features and personal contacts.

Significant evidence points toward sleep disruption among psychiatric inpatients. It is unclear, however, how environmental factors (e.g., dorm-style rooms) impact sleep quality in this population. To assess sleep quality, a novel objective technology, actigraphy, was used before and after a facility move. Subjective daily interviews were also administered, along with the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Actigraphy revealed significant improvements in objective sleep quality following the facility move. Interestingly, subjective report of sleep quality did not correlate with the objective measures. Circadian sleep type appeared to play a role in influencing subjective attitudes toward sleep quality. Built environment has a significant effect on the sleep quality of psychiatric inpatients.

Care homes have endeavored to utilize this approach but have struggled to find a design and approach that works for this setting. Study aims were to appraise the evolving concept of MSEs from a user perspective, to study the aesthetic and functional qualities, to identify barriers to staff engagement with a sensory environment approach, and to identify design criteria to improve the potential of MSE for people with dementia. Data were collected from 16 care homes with experience of MSE using ethnographic methods, incorporating semi-structured interviews, and observations of MSE design. Analysis was undertaken using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Observations revealed equipment that predominantly stimulated vision and touch. Thematic analysis of the semi-structured interviews revealed six themes: not knowing what to do in the room, good for people in the later stages of the disease, reduces anxiety, it's a good activity, design and setting up of the space, and including relatives and care staff. Few MSEs in care homes are designed to meet needs of people with dementia, and staff receive little training in how to facilitate sessions.

LELs resulted in quantifications of key operational and design features (e.g., design preferences of employees and patients, horizontal distance travel, and elevator utilization studies), which in turn complemented the architectural design process and created an opportunities to gain buy-in and consensus from stakeholders through their active participation in many of the analyses. We found Lean tools and methods to be of most value during programming phase when focused on the high-level operational and design issues to help establish buy-in and consensus among stakeholders, while acknowledging that there is often not enough design detail to perform accurate analysis. ","412":"The objective of the present study was to describe how a specific patient flow analysis with from-to charts can be used in hospital design and layout planning. As part of a large renewal project at a university hospital, a detailed patient flow analysis was applied to planning the musculoskeletal surgery unit (orthopedics and traumatology, hand surgery, and plastic surgery). First, the main activities of the unit were determined. Next, the routes of all patients treated over the course of 1 year were studied, and their physical movements in the current hospital were calculated. An ideal layout of the new hospital was then generated to minimize transfer distances by placing the main activities with close to each other, according to the patient flow analysis. The actual architectural design was based on the ideal layout plan. Finally, we compared the current transfer distances to the distances patients will move in the new hospital. The methods enabled us to estimate an approximate 50% reduction in transfer distances for inpatients (from 3,100 km\/year to 1,600 km\/year) and 30% reduction for outpatients (from 2,100 km\/year to 1,400 km\/year). Patient transfers are nonvalue-added activities. This study demonstrates that a detailed patient flow analysis with from-to charts can substantially shorten transfer distances, thereby minimizing extraneous patient and personnel movements. This reduction supports productivity improvement, cross-professional teamwork, and patient safety by placing all patient flow activities close to each other. Thus, this method is a valuable additional tool in hospital design. ","413":"Environmental cues, such as pictures, could be helpful in improving room-finding and wayfinding abilities among older patients. The aim of this study was to identify picture categories that are preferred and easily remembered by older patients and cognitively impaired patients and which therefore might be suitable for use as environmental cues in acute care settings. Twelve pictures were presented to a sample of older patients ( n = 37). The pictures represented different categories: familiarity (familiar vs. unfamiliar), type of shot (close-up vs. wide shot), and picture content (nature vs. animal vs. urban). We tested the patients' votes of preference and abilities to identify and immediately recall pictures. Cognitively impaired patients ( n = 14) were assessed by the abbreviated mental test and the mini mental state examination and were compared with patients without cognitive impairments ( n = 23) using a repeated measures analysis of variance. The results showed a main effect of familiarity on positive vote and recall of pictures. The absence of interaction effects of familiarity and group indicated an overall impact of familiarity on the sample. Within cognitively impaired patients, a significant difference in recall of picture content between urban (20%) and animal (9%) was found. Pictures, which patients were able to relate to in terms of familiarity and the characteristics urban and nature, seem to be suitable for use as environmental cues. Besides functioning as such, we assume, based on literature, that pictures could further enhance the ambiance or serve as prompts for communication and interaction. ","414":"The purpose of this study was to determine what differences occurred in steps taken and energy expenditure among acute care nurses when their work environment moved from a hospital with centralized nurses' stations to a hospital with decentralized nurses' stations. Additional goals were to determine design features nurses perceived as contributing to or deterring from their work activities and what changes occurred in reported job satisfaction. Since design features can also affect patient outcomes, patient falls were monitored. The construction of a replacement facility for a 224-bed Level 1 trauma center provided the opportunity to compare the effects of centralized versus decentralized nurses' stations on nurses' experiences of their work environments. A pre-post quasi-experimental design was used. RN participants completed an open-ended questionnaire and recorded pedometer data at the end of each shift, working for 3-month pre-relocation and for 3-month post-relocation. Nine months passed between the move and post-relocation data collection. There were significant reductions in nurses' energy expenditure ( p &lt; .001) and steps taken ( p = .041) post-relocation. Overall, nurses' job satisfaction was high and improved post-relocation, and patient falls decreased by 55%. Post-relocation, a number of the dissatisfiers associated with the physical environment were eliminated, and nurses identified more satisfiers (in general and related to the physical environment). Patients are safer post-relocation as indicated by a decrease in falls. This decrease is even more noteworthy when considering that the numbers of patient beds on each unit is higher post-relocation.

Problems with the design, implementation, and real-world use of patient monitoring systems result in alarm fatigue. A multidisciplinary team is developing an open-source tool kit to promote bedside informatics research and mitigate alarm fatigue. Simulation, HFE, and computer science experts created a novel simulation methodology to study alarm fatigue. Featuring multiple interconnected simulated patient scenarios with scripted timeline, \"distractor\" patient care tasks, and triggered true and false alarms, the methodology incorporated objective metrics to assess provider and system performance. Developed materials were implemented during institutional review board-approved study sessions that assessed and compared an experimental multiparametric alerting system with a standard monitor telemetry system for subject response, use characteristics, and end-user feedback. A four-patient simulation setup featuring objective metrics for participant task-related performance and response to alarms was developed along with accompanying structured HFE assessment (questionnaire and interview) for monitor systems use testing. Two pilot and four study sessions with individual nurse subjects elicited true alarm and false alarm responses (including diversion from assigned tasks) as well as nonresponses to true alarms. In-simulation observation and subject questionnaires were used to test the experimental system's approach to suppressing false alarms and alerting providers. A novel investigative methodology applied simulation and HFE techniques to replicate and study alarm fatigue in controlled settings for systems assessment and experimental research purposes.

This article examines the current state of practice-based research (PBR), supports the need for EBD, illustrates PBR methods that can be applied to design work, and explores how findings can be used as a decision-making tool during design and as a validation tool during postoccupancy. As a result, design professions' body of knowledge will advance and practitioners will be better informed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the society. Furthermore, characteristics of Friedman's progressive research program are used as a framework to examine the current state of PBR in design practice. A modified EBD approach is proposed and showcased with a case study of a renovated inpatient unit. The modified approach demonstrates how a highly integrated project team, especially the role of design practitioners, contributed to the success of utilizing baseline findings and evidence in decision-making throughout the design process. Lastly, recommendations and resources for learning research concepts are provided for practitioners. It is the role of practitioners to pave the way for the next generation of design professionals, as the request and expectation for research become more prevalent in design practice.","417":"To explore how Lean can add value during the schematic phase of design through providing additional resources and support to project leadership and the architectural design team. This case study-based research took place at one large academic hospital during design efforts of surgical tower to house 19 operating rooms (ORs) and support spaces including pre- and post-op, central processing and distribution, and materials management. Surgical services project leadership asked for Lean practitioners' support during the design process. Lean Exploration Loops (LELs) were conducted to generate evidence to support stakeholders, as they made important decisions about the new building design. The analyses conducted during LELs during the schematic phase were primarily conducted using express workouts (EWOs) and were focused on the flow of patients, staff, and family throughout the pavilion. LELs resulted in recommendations for key design features (e.g., number of pre- and post-op bays per OR floor, location of doors, scrub sinks, stretcher alcoves, equipment storage, and sterile core areas). Two-sided pre- and post-op bays with an inner clinical workspace and an outer patient transport corridor were recommended. Communicating elevator and a centrally located stairwell for staff to alleviate stress on the main bank of elevators at peak usage times were also suggested. We found Lean tools and methods to be of most value during schematic phase when focused on detailed process and layout analysis, while acknowledging the usefulness of focused EWOs to generate the evidence needed for the decision-making. ","418":"Operating lamps are often seen as the most disruptive factors within the protective area in the operating theater (OT). The effect of the operation lamps (with different shapes) should be demonstrated in an OT by trial, since research on the effects of the lamps is still limited. The main aim of this study was to determine the effects of a skirt, different lamps, and the position of the lamp on the protected area. The concentration of airborne particles was measured under different circumstances, in order to determine the size and quality of the protected area. This entrainment\/segregation test is based on the deliberate and controlled emission of particles outside the zone that is protected. The degree of protection (DP) at the center of the protected area was higher for the case with the skirt. This skirt stimulates more down flow and prevents the early entry of particles into the protected area. It can also be concluded that Lamp Y, due to its open shape, has the most positive effect on the DP at the center. It has also been shown that the position of the lamp has an effect on the protected area. ","419":"To investigate what key stakeholders consider to be the advantages and the opportunities for improvement in using lean thinking and tools in the integrated project delivery (IPD) process. A detailed literature review was followed by case study of a Lean-IPD project. Interviews with members of the project leadership team, focus groups with the integrated team as well as the design team, and an online survey of all stakeholders were conducted. Statistical analysis and thematic content analysis were used to analyze the data, followed by a plus-delta analysis. (1) Learning is a large, implicit benefit of Lean-IPD that is not currently captured by any success metric; (2) the cardboard mock-up was the most successful lean strategy; (3) although a collaborative project, the level of influence of different stakeholder groups was perceived to be different by different stakeholders; (4) overall, Lean-IPD was rated as better than traditional design-bid-build methods; and (5) opportunities for improvement reported were increase in accurate cost estimating, more efficient use of time, perception of imbalance of control\/influence, and need for facilitation (which represents different points of view). While lean tools and an IPD method are preferred to traditional design-bid-build methods, the perception of different stakeholders varies and more work needs to be done to allow a truly shared decision-making model.

POEs often end with the reporting of findings rather than suggesting how this knowledge feeds forward. A design charrette presents an opportunity to engage with POE evidence and integrate research into practice. Planning for the POE resulted in a multiphased, multimethodological study. Data collection and analysis utilized objective and subjective measures yielding both qualitative and quantitative data. The design charrette then served as an interactive method to assist design practitioners in both understanding and applying the research findings in the redesign of the entry\/triage sequence of the ED. POE findings revealed four key issues impacting the ED experience. These include workflow, communication, privacy and confidentiality, and safety and security. In analyzing the use of the charrette to link POE findings to design application, it was determined that the charrette should include an all-inclusive, collaborative process, easily interpreted evidence, active participant engagement, and feasible outcomes grounded in research. Taking the POE process full cycle is a critical component in bridging the gap between research and its application to design. The charrette process offers a positive mark of completion to the POE and helps participants gain sensitivity to the importance of evidence-based decision-making.

In the hospital setting, most patients expect a certain degree of privacy but also understand that their caregivers need appropriate access to them in order to provide high-quality care. Even veteran healthcare designers may struggle to create just the right balance between privacy and accessibility. A paper-based survey was conducted with 159 participants in Hong Kong-72 (45.3%) participants had been hospitalized and 87 (54.7%) participants had not-to document their selection of high-privacy beds, given simplified plans of eight nursing units. Two types of information, comprised of six variables, were examined for each bed. These include (1) room-level variables, specifically the number of beds per room and area per bed and (2) relational variables, including walking distance, directional change, integration, and control. The results demonstrate that when asked to identify high-privacy beds, participants selected beds in patient rooms with fewer beds per room, a larger area per bed, and a longer walking distance to the care team workstation. Interestingly, the participants having been hospitalized also chose beds with a visual connection to the care team workstation as being high in privacy. The participants with hospitalization experience may be willing to accept a bed with reduced visual privacy, perhaps out of a concern for safety.

The basics of the childbirth process have not changed since the beginning of human existence; however, the environment in which women today give birth has changed significantly. Incorporating design elements and strategies that calm and reduce negative emotions may create positive experiences for women in labor. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of one such strategy, namely, the presentation of images of nature, on the labor and delivery experience. The study findings showed that the experimental condition has a higher score on the Quality of Care From the Patient's Perspective (QPP) subscale. In addition, there was an increase in the QPP scores associated with the increase in Nature TV watching time, QPP mean of watching time (less than 1 hr) group, m = 4.5 and QPP mean of watching time (more than 3 hs), m = 4.8. The mean score for the heart rate was lower in the experimental condition, m = 84.60, than in the control one, m = 90.49. For Apgar, the mean score was higher for Group A, m = 8.65, and Group B, m = 8.92. These findings support the study hypothesis which states that the nature images would influence the labor experience positively. In addition, the findings emphasize the importance of incorporating nonpharmacological techniques in the labor and delivery room (LDR) units to sooth the pain. Adding nature imagery to the LDR environment can be one of these techniques.","426":"The objective of this study was to compare the noise levels recorded in two different neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) settings: a pod and an open plan NICU located in the same hospital. The NICU is a busy environment with ambient noise levels that often exceed established recommendations. This noise deleteriously affects the physiological stability and developmental outcomes of sick and preterm infants. Pods have reduced numbers of cots (in this case, 6) compared to open plan NICUs (in this case, 11), yet the noise levels in pods have not been reported. This study compared real-time decibel (dB) levels in an A-weighted scale, captured continuously by sound dosimeters mounted in both NICU settings for a period of 4 weeks: a pod setting and an open plan NICU. Researchers also collected observational data. The average noise level recorded in the pod was 3 dBs less than in the open plan NICU. This result was statistically significant. However, dB recordings in both areas were over the recommended limits by 4-6 dBs, with isolated peaks between 74.5 dBs (NICU) and 75.9 dBs (pod). Observational data confirmed this correlation. Further research to evaluate interventions to decrease the noise levels in both settings are needed, especially during times of peak activity. Staff working in these settings need to be more aware that control of acoustic levels is important in the neuroprotection of neonates.

However, the interactions between patient safety and energy efficiency have not been adequately addressed to realize the full benefits of retrofitting healthcare facilities. To address this, an innovative integrated framework, the Patient Safety and Energy Efficiency (PATSiE) framework, was developed to simultaneously enhance patient safety and energy efficiency. The framework includes a step -: by -: step procedure for enhancing both patient safety and energy efficiency. It provides a structured overview of the different stages involved in retrofitting healthcare facilities and improves understanding of the intricacies associated with integrating patient safety improvements with energy efficiency enhancements.

Rural hospitals have served as the backbone of rural communities in the United States. Over time, these facilities have witnessed enhanced expectations, expanding their scope of operations from acute care to diversified services through linked provider networks and disaster management. Simultaneously, financial challenges, increasing emphasis on safety and quality, and the Affordable Care Act have introduced new challenges for rural hospitals. Currently, there is little empirical knowledge in this domain from a facility perspective. An exploratory qualitative study was conducted, involving semistructured interviews of upper and mid-level administrators in four rural hospitals located in West Texas. All questions attempted to obtain the subject's knowledge, ideas, and opinions concerning the physical design of the hospitals and the hospital experience. According to data on staff experiences, two classes of factors surfaced as potential influencers of hospital experience and care quality: (1) care configuration and (2) outdated building. Care configuration pertains to positioning facilities designed with inpatient care focus to a market expanding in outpatient services. Outdated buildings affect several issue including perceived provider quality and spatial accommodations for safe\/efficient care and thereby also affecting the healthcare experience.

Implementing measures to improve patient safety is essential particularly in a psychiatric hospital, where limited research has been conducted on inpatient safety. Therefore, this article aims to understand the incident patterns from the lens of the five levels of safety framework, which categorizes spaces according to the level of patient supervision in psychiatric facilities, as follows: service areas, corridors, dayrooms, patient rooms and bathrooms, seclusions and admissions. In an 81-bed psychiatric hospital, this mixed-method study drew 7 years of incident reports and caregivers' perceptions gathered through focus groups. Incident reports on physical safety were analyzed based on the five levels of safety framework ( N = 1,316). Focus groups ( n = 9) explored the caregivers' viewpoints on patient safety and five categories of spaces. Overall findings support the five levels of safety pattern, confirming that most incidents occurred in patient rooms and bathrooms; moreover, relatively fewer incidents happened in dayrooms and corridors. Elopements are higher in hallways and dayrooms. Suicide is most common in patient rooms and bathrooms, and violence is more frequent in dayrooms. Focus groups results yielded insightful recommendations.

This pilot study was a prospective, longitudinal observational study of a convenience sample of healthcare clinicians. In one inpatient room, clinicians were exposed to a hand hygiene reminder that consisted of a light turning on over the sink as they entered. A control room (the adjacent inpatient room) did not have the intervention. A total of 88 clinician encounters were monitored during the study. On the first observation day at the initial activation of the signal light system, the percentage of clinicians performing hand hygiene upon entering a room was only 7% in the control room and 23% in the intervention room. During the second observation (Day 14), those percentages were 16% in the control room and 30% in the intervention room. During the third observation (Day 21), those percentages were 23% in the control room and 23% in the intervention room.

Well-designed physical environments can positively impact on health and well-being among older persons with frail health living in RCFs and are essential for supporting person-centered care. However, the evidence base for informing the design of RCFs is weak, partly due to a lack of valid and reliable instruments that could provide important information on the environmental quality. Twenty RCFs were purposively sampled from several regions, varying in their building design, year of construction, size, and geographic location. The RCFs were assessed using S-SCEAM and the data were analyzed to examine variation in environmental quality between and within facilities. There was substantial variation in the quality of the physical environment between and within RCFs, reflected in S-SCEAM scores related to specific facility locations and with regard to domains reflecting residents' needs. In general, private apartments and dining areas had high S-SCEAM scores, while gardens had lower scores. Scores on the safety domain were high in the majority of RCFs, whereas scores for cognitive support and privacy were relatively low. Despite high building standard requirements, the substantial variations regarding environmental quality between and within RCFs indicate the potential for improvements to support the needs of older persons. We conclude that S-SCEAM is a sensitive and unique instrument representing a valuable contribution to evidence-based design that can support person-centered care.

The importance of the neonatology service and the variety of users place great demands on the space at all levels. Despite the repercussions, the emotional aspects of the environment have received less attention. To avoid incurring limitations in the user mental scheme, this study uses two complementary methodologies: focus group and semantic differential. The (qualitative) focus group methodology provides exploratory information and concepts. The (quantitative) semantic differential methodology then uses these concepts to extract the conceptual structures that users employ in their assessment of the space. Of the total 175 subjects, 31 took part in focus groups and 144 in semantic differential. Five independent concepts were identified: privacy, functionality and professional nature, spaciousness, lighting, and cleanliness. In relation to the importance of the overall positive assessment of the space, the perception of privacy and sensations of dominance and pleasure are fundamental. Six relevant design aspects were also identified: provide spacious surroundings, facilitate sufficient separation between the different posts or cots, use different colors from those usually found in health-care centers, as some aversion was found to white and especially green, design areas with childhood themes, use warm artificial light, and choose user-friendly equipment.

Several design elements and spaces were identified through the image survey as influential in eliciting feelings of calm among patients. Additionally, staff were also influenced by the new unit design, generating feelings of calm, safety, and pride in the work environment. Results suggest that design features in which patients have choice and control offer greater perceptions of calm during their stay in the unit. Staff were positively influenced by the colors and artwork throughout the unit as well as the upgraded security and safety features.

Patient experience has emerged as an important metric for quality of healthcare. A number of separate concepts have been used to measure patient experience, but psychological research suggests that subjective experience is actually a composite of several independent concepts including: (a) evaluation\/valence, (b) potency\/control, (c) activity\/arousal, and (d) novelty. The present research evaluates the reliability of a multidimensional patient experience measurement questionnaire in a clinical setting. A multidimensional semantic differential questionnaire was developed to measure the four underlying semantic dimensions of patient experience mentioned above. A group of 60 patients used the questionnaire to assess prescan expectations and postscan experience of a magnetic resonance scan. Data for one patient were deleted because their scan was interrupted. Results revealed more positive evaluation\/valence, higher potency\/control, and lower activity\/arousal for postscan ratings compared to prescan expectations. Ratings of novelty were neutral in both the prescan and the postscan conditions. Subsequent analysis suggested that internal consistency for some concepts could be improved by replacing several specific rating scales. Present results provide evidence of the utility and reliability of a multidimensional semantic questionnaire for measuring patient experience in an actual clinical setting.

The study employed mixed methods including historical review, case studies, surveys, interviews, pilot garden projects, and Geographic Information System mapping. The number of participating institutions varied by method. Benefits associated with on-site food production can be health, economic, environmental, and social. There are also institutional barriers including administrative roadblocks, perceived obstacles, and the difficulty in quantitatively, measuring the qualitatively documented benefits. The benefits of food gardens far outweigh the challenges. On-site food production has tremendous potential to improve nutrition for staff and patients, offer healing spaces, better connect institutions with the communities in which they are located, and provide the long-professed benefits of gardening for all involved-from therapeutic benefits and outdoor physical activities to developing skills and social relationships in ways that few other activities do.

This article compares three designs, the current design, an anecdotal design, and an evidence-based design, to identify how evidence-based design can improve efficiency and staff well-being by reducing walking time and distance. Data were collected from the existing building and used to measure the efficiency of the department in its current state. These data were then mapped onto an anecdotal design, produced by architects from interviews and workshops with the end users, and an evidence-based design, produced by highlighting functions with high adjacencies. This changed the view on the working processes within the department, shifting away from a focus on the existing robotic dispensing system. Using evidence-based design was found to decrease the walking time and distance for staff by 24%, as opposed to the anecdotal design, which increased these parameters by 9%, and is predicted to save the department 248 min across 2 days in staff time spent walking. ","457":"To explore inhibiting and facilitating design factors influencing childbirth supporters' experiences. Birthing women benefit from the continuous, cooperative presence of supporters. However, little research has investigated how birth room design facilitates or inhibits supporters' role navigation. We conducted an exploratory video ethnographic single case study of childbirth supporters' experiences, within an Australian hospital birth environment. Video, field notes, and video-cued reflexive interviews with the woman, her midwives, and supporters were thematically analyzed using ethnographic\/symbolic interactionist perspectives to frame supporters' understandings. Findings suggest supporters' experiences are complex, made more complicated by sparse understanding or accommodation of their needs in the built environment. Supporters' presence and roles are not facilitated by the physical space; they experience \"an unbelonging paradox\" of being needed, yet uncertain and \"in the way\" during \"tenuous nest-building\" activities. Suggested design guidelines to facilitate supporters' well-being and their roles in designed hospital birth spaces are provided. ","458":"Security, a subset of safety, is equally important in the efficient delivery of patient care. The emergency department (ED) is susceptible to violence creating concerns for the safety and security of patients, staff, and visitors and for the safe and efficient delivery of care. Although there is an implicit and growing recognition of the role of the physical environment, interventions typically have been at the microlevel. The objective of this study was to identify physical design attributes that potentially influence safety and efficiency of ED operations. An exploratory, qualitative research design was adopted to examine the efficiency and safety correlates of ED physical design attributes. The study comprised a multimeasure approach involving multidisciplinary gaming, semistructured interviews, and touring interviews of frontline staff in four EDs at three hospital systems across three states. Five macro physical design attributes (issues that need to be addressed at the design stage and expensive to rectify once built) emerged from the data as factors substantially associated with security issues. They are design issues pertaining to (a) the entry zone, (b) traffic management, (c) patient room clustering, (d) centralization versus decentralization, and (e) provisions for special populations. Data from this study suggest that ED security concerns are generally associated with three sources: (a) gang-related violence, (b) dissatisfied patients, and (c) behavioral health patients. Study data show that physical design has an important role in addressing the above-mentioned concerns. Implications for ED design are outlined in the article. ","459":"The purpose of this methodology paper is to describe an approach to qualitative design known as qualitative descriptive that is well suited to junior health sciences researchers because it can be used with a variety of theoretical approaches, sampling techniques, and data collection strategies. It is often difficult for junior qualitative researchers to pull together the tools and resources they need to embark on a high-quality qualitative research study and to manage the volumes of data they collect during qualitative studies. This paper seeks to pull together much needed resources and provide an overview of methods. A step-by-step guide to planning a qualitative descriptive study and analyzing the data is provided, utilizing exemplars from the authors' research. This paper presents steps to conducting a qualitative descriptive study under the following headings: describing the qualitative descriptive approach, designing a qualitative descriptive study, steps to data analysis, and ensuring rigor of findings. The qualitative descriptive approach results in a summary in everyday, factual language that facilitates understanding of a selected phenomenon across disciplines of health science researchers. ","460":"In this article, we explore what a different way of moving-being wheeled versus walking-means for the spatial experience of day surgery patients. Day surgery centers can be conceived in very different manners. Some are organized similar to traditional hospital admittance; others are located in a specifically designed part of the hospital and receive patients as guests who walk through the entire procedure. We conducted semistructured interviews with 37 patients at two distinct day surgery centers. Despite the different managerial concepts and corresponding spatial designs, in both centers, patients' spatial experience is shaped by the interrelation of material, social, and time-related aspects. However, the chosen concept results in a different experience throughout patients' journey. Based on an analysis of the different journeys, we conclude that patients' interpretation of a hospital's care vision is influenced not only by what the hospital communicates explicitly or how it educates its staff but also by what is implicitly told by the built environment. ","461":"To examine the impact of spatial enclosures on social interaction between older adults with early stage dementia and young children. Intergenerational interaction through meaningful activities can promote positive affects and behaviors of children and older adults. The development of social interaction is closely related to the physical environment in association with personal competence of older adults with dementia and young children. However, minimal attention has been given to the role of physical environment in influencing intergenerational interaction. A quasi-experiment examined the functional relationship between the amount of spatial enclosure and the types of social behaviors of older adults with dementia and young children. Semi-structured interviews, aided by a photographic simulation, were developed to explore the participants' perceptions of and experiences with the different degrees of spatial enclosure. Findings showed that the semienclosed spatial plan impacted both prosocial and antisocial behaviors of older adults with dementia in their interactions with young children. This apparent discrepancy was associated with two conflicting perceptions: a sense of openness and the lack of control due to distraction created by the loose visual boundary. There was no correlation between the elder-child neutral behaviors and the degrees of spatial enclosure. This study suggests that spaces with moderate openness without visual and acoustic distraction are the most desirable to promote prosocial behaviors of older adults with dementia and young children. Additionally, elder-child prosocial behaviors were likely facilitated by specific design features such as adequate personal space, the perception of openness, and possible spaces that provide both prospect and refuge in relation to spatial enclosure. ","462":"This article reviews and addresses various spatial measures that provide and facilitate accurate descriptions of different layout typologies with particular focus on healthcare facilities. Evidence-based design is a field of study that emphasizes the importance of using credible data in order to influence the design process. It addresses whether\/how the design and operation of buildings support positive health outcomes through a growing collection of solutions informed by research and practical knowledge. In order to acquire this knowledge, we must consider the environment in a very precise and measurable way, which can then be investigated quantitatively with regard to various human behaviors and cognitive processes. Space Syntax theory and methods are concerned with understanding how spaces are arranged and connected to one another. It provides quantitative measures of individual spaces and of the entire layout, thereby achieving great accuracy. Space Syntax researchers have used graph theory to define spatial measures and have produced computer tools to quantify the relational properties of spaces and to provide numerical and display values for each. Moreover, they have developed more precise tools that can be embedded within basic Space Syntax concepts in order to augment the credibility of the acquired data. The study elaborates on the effectiveness of Space Syntax and its newly developed measures for the field of healthcare facility design and research. We present a comprehensive model that brings together these measures with their correlated behavioral and perceptual consequences, thereby providing a point of departure for further investigation and exploration.

Manual washing of bedpans and other containers poses a risk of spreading infection via caregivers, the environment, and the still-contaminated bedpan. Several alternative disposal methods are available and have been tested in some countries for decades, including options such as bedpan washer-disinfector machines, macerator machines, and disposable bedpans. This article reviews methods and issues related to human waste disposal in healthcare settings. Healthcare organizations must evaluate the options thoroughly and then consistently implement the option most in line with its goals and culture. ","464":"This study analyzes 10 intensive care units (ICUs) to understand the associations between design features of space layout and nurse-to-patient visibility parameters. Previous studies have explored how different hospital units vary in their visibility relations and how such varied visibility relations result in different nurse behaviors toward patients. However, more limited research has examined the specific design attributes of the layouts that determine the varied visibility relations in the unit. Changes in size, geometry, or other attributes of design elements in nursing units, which might affect patient observation opportunities, require more research. This article reviews the literature to indicate evidence for the impact of hospital unit design on nurse\/patient visibility relations and to identify design parameters shown to affect visibility. It further focuses on 10 ICUs to investigate how different layouts diverge regarding their visibility relations using a set of metrics developed by other researchers. Shape geometry and corridor width, as two selected design features, are compared. Corridor width and shape characteristics of ICUs are positively correlated with visibility. Results suggest that floor plans, which are repeatedly broken down into smaller convex (higher convex fragmentation values), or units, which have longer distances between their rooms or between their two opposite ends (longer relative grid distances), might have lower visibility levels across the unit. The findings of this study also suggest that wider corridors positively affect visibility of patient rooms. Changes in overall shape configuration and corridor width of nursing units may have important effects on patient observation and monitoring opportunities. ","465":"To examine whether exposure to curve versus sharp contours in the built healthcare setting produces systematic and identifiable patterns of amygdala activation and behavioral response in healthy adults. Recent studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that humans prefer objects with a curved contour compared with objects that have pointed features and a sharp-angled contour. An implicit perception of threat represented by sharp objects, in humans, was hypothesized to explain this bias. The study adopted a within-subject experimental design, where 36 subjects (representing three age-groups and both sexes) were exposed to a randomized order of 312 real-life images (objects, interiors, exteriors, landscape, and a set of control images). Amygdala activation was simultaneously captured using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology. Subjects' preference (like\/dislike) data were also collected while in the scanner. Data were collected in 2013. In case of images depicting landscape and healthcare objects, brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with sharp contours. However, in relation to images depicting hospital interiors and exterior envelops, brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with curve contours. These activations pertain to exposure during the precognitive stages of the subjects' perception. Hospital forms do have systematic impact on fear response during precognitive stages of human perception. Whether this first impression colors the subsequent experience of an actual patient with real illness or injury is unknown. ","466":"There is a growing recognition that environmental design impacts health and well-being. Nature contact is a design feature or exposure that is especially important in public health and healthcare. To date, there are limited findings on the impact of nature sounds. This experimental study was designed to examine the effect of nature sounds on physiological and psychological stress. Participants were randomized into one of three groups-silence (n = 9), nature sound (n = 17), and classical music (n = 14)-and listened to the assigned sound for 15 min in an office or waiting room-like environment. Pre- and postdata were collected including muscle tension (electromyogram), pulse rate, and self-reported stress. With the exception of pulse rate, there were no statistical differences in baseline or demographics among groups. A paired t-test by group showed a decrease in muscle tension, pulse rate, and self-reported stress in the nature group and no significant differences in the control or the classical music groups. The significant reduction in muscle tension occurred at least by 7 min of listening to the nature sound. This study highlights the potential benefit of even very brief (less than 7 min) exposure to nature sounds. Brief nature sound \"booster breaks\" are a promising area for future research with important practical implications.

Universal symbols are an important innovative tool for health facility wayfinding systems. Hablamos Juntos, a universal healthcare symbol system developed in the United States, is a thoughtful, well-designed, and thoroughly tested symbol system that facilitates communication across languages and cultures. We designed a questionnaire to test how well the selected graphic symbols were understood by Taiwanese participants and determined factors related to successful symbol decoding, including participant-related factors, stimulation factors, and the interaction between stimulation and participants. Additionally, we further established a design principle for future development of localized healthcare symbols. (1) Eleven symbols were identified as highly comprehensible and effective symbols that can be directly adopted in Taiwanese healthcare settings. Sixteen symbols were deemed incomprehensible or confusing and thus had to be redesigned. Finally, 14 were identified as relatively incomprehensible and could thus be redesigned and then have their effectiveness evaluated again. (2) Three factors were found to influence the participants' differing levels of comprehension of the Hablamos Juntos symbols. In order to prevent the three aforementioned factors from causing difficulty in interpreting symbols, we suggest that the local symbol designers should (1) use more iconic images, (2) carefully evaluate the indexical and symbolic meaning of graphic symbols, and (3) collect the consensus of Taiwanese people with different educational backgrounds.

The physiological and psychological benefits of daylighting have made it an increasingly important topic in multidisciplinary research. Although multiple studies have been written about the impact of daylight on physiological responses, few investigations have been made into the nonvisual effects related to resident mood, satisfaction, and stress level. In addition, researchers typically propose recommendations for quantitative aspects of illuminance, rather than addressing the behavioural outcomes. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used to address the research questions. Thirty-four participants, who were living temporarily in the inpatient rehabilitation units of two skilled nursing facilities, were subjects in semistructured interviews and a 7-question 5-scale survey. While residents expressed the need to have direct visual access to the outdoors, they indicated that daylight was of even higher benefit. Additionally, they noted that size and location of windows impacted their stress levels, moods, and activities. More than half of the facility residents reported changing their postures for either better outdoor views or less light disturbance while sleeping. The results of this study emphasize the importance of daylighting for residents in rehabilitation units. Architects should acknowledge the role of daylighting and window views in the design of rehabilitation facilities.

The quasi-experiment was conducted on a geriatric ward of an acute care hospital. Patients with dementia were included (n = 42). To test the effectiveness of environmental cues, two rooms were enhanced with the environmental cue \"color,\" two rooms with the cue \"number,\" and two rooms with the cue \"patient's name\". Four rooms were not redesigned and were used as control rooms. For analysis, we pooled the intervention groups color and number (n = 14) and compared it with the control group (n = 22). The environmental cues color and number were significantly effective to improve the identification of the wardrobe from the third to the fifth day after admission. However, for the 10th-12th day after admission, we found no difference in results. Furthermore, results indicate improvements in the ability to identify the bed by using the environmental cues color and number. As this study indicated, the environmental cues color and number are helpful for these patients to identify their bed and wardrobe. However, these cues were most effective from the third to the fifth day after admission. To sustain their effectiveness on patients' identification abilities during their hospital stay, we discuss, whether verbal prompting and an ongoing mentioning of such cues, embedded in the daily work of nurses, could be beneficial.

Little research has explored how patients evaluate the physical environment of their hospital rooms. Most responses are captured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, which includes only two questions about the physical environment. Two hundred thirty-six orthopedic patients (78 in the United States and 158 in Portugal) listed three features of their hospital room that influenced their level of satisfaction with their hospital stay, indicating whether the feature was positive or negative. The comments were more positive (71.4%) than negative (28.6%). Using the framework of supportive design from Ulrich, over half the comments (64.31%) could be categorized in one of the three dimensions: 33.2% (positive distraction), 22.4% (perceived control), and 6.0% (social support). This total includes Internet (2.7%), which could be categorized as either social support or positive distraction. Comments called \"other aspects\" focused on overall environmental appraisals, cleanliness, and functionality and maintenance. The majority of comments could be accommodated by Ulrich's theory, but it is noteworthy that other aspects emerge from patients' comments and affect their experience. Cross-cultural differences pointed to the greater role of light and sun for Portuguese patients and health status whiteboard for U.S. Qualitative research can add significantly to our understanding of the healthcare experience and may inform design decisions. ","477":"The environment is inextricably related to mental health. Recent research replicates findings of a significant, linear correlation between a childhood exposure to the urban environment and psychosis. Related studies also correlate the urban environment and aberrant brain morphologies. These findings challenge common beliefs that the mind and brain remain neutral in the face of worldly experience. There is a signature within these neurological findings that suggests that specific features of design cause and trigger mental illness. The objective in this article is to work backward from the molecular dynamics to identify features of the designed environment that may either trigger mental illness or protect against it. This review analyzes the discrete functions putatively assigned to the affected brain areas and a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which is the primary target of most antipsychotic medications. The intention is to establish what the correlations mean in functional terms, and more specifically, how this relates to the phenomenology of urban experience. In doing so, environmental mental illness risk factors are identified. Having established these relationships, the review makes practical recommendations for those in public health who wish to use the environment itself as a tool to improve the mental health of a community through design. ","478":"To measure patients' perceptions of the environment of care (EOC), with a focus on the physical environment, in which healthcare is delivered. The EOC may impact patient experiences, care perceptions, and health outcomes. EOC may be improved through redesign of existing physical structures or spaces or by adding nurturing amenities. Demographics, health status, hospital use, and data on the environment (physical, comfort, orientation, and privacy) were collected via a mailed cross-sectional survey sent to patients seen at four hospital Centers of Innovation (COIs; that implemented many modifications to the healthcare environment to address physical, comfort, orientation, and privacy factors) and four matched controls, supplemented with checklist and VA administrative data. A modified Perceived Hospital Environment Quality Indicators instrument was used to measure patients' EOC perceptions. Respondents (3,321\/5,117; 65% response) rated, [mean (SD)], exterior space highest, 3.09 (0.73), followed by interior space, 2.96 (0.74), and privacy, 2.44 (1.01). COIs had significantly higher ratings than controls on interior space (2.99 vs. 2.96, p = .02) and privacy (2.48 vs. 2.38, p = .005) but no differences for exterior space. Subscales with significantly higher ratings in COIs (vs. controls) in interior space were \"spatial-physical comfort\" and \"orientation,\" for example, clean, good signage, spacious rooms, and for privacy included \"not too crowded\" and \"able to talk without being overheard.\" Checklist findings confirmed the presence of EOC innovations rated highly by patients. Patients identified cleanliness, good signs\/information points, adequate seating, nonovercrowding, and privacy for conversations as important. Hospital design modifications, with particular attention to the physical environment, can improve patient EOC perceptions. ","479":"To explore the existing theoretical contexts of the job and environmental demands of the nursing profession in the National Health Service (NHS) and to investigate how these job and environmental demands impact on the personal constructs of older nurses within the NHS. Nursing is the single most widely practiced profession in the healthcare sector in the United Kingdom. However, nurses contend with challenging job and environmental demands on a daily basis, which deplete them of personal constructs (or resources) required to stay in the profession. A multilevel exploratory qualitative research design was employed. Ten managers were interviewed for the preliminary study, based on which the three characteristics of an age-friendly NHS workplace were established: health, retirement, and flexibility. Then an in-depth literature review revealed that the most adversely affected job within the NHS was the nursing profession. Finally, a focus group study was undertaken with six older nurses working in the NHS. The most compelling finding of this study is that older nurses would generally not want to stay on the job if they had to work in the ward area. The physical, cognitive, and sensory constructs of older nurses are negatively affected by the job and environmental demands of the ward areas. Understanding how these job and environmental demands of the workplace affect an older nurse's personal constructs may help support a better design of nurse work and the wards and help extend the working lives of older nurses in the NHS. ","480":"This study was designed to ascertain the amount of outdoor, indoor, and indirect nature contact exposures hospital employees have in a workweek. Hospital employees have been found particularly vulnerable to work-related stress. Increasing the nature contact exposure for hospital employees can reduce perceived stress; stress-related health behaviors; and stress-related health outcomes from outdoor, indoor, and indirect exposures to nature. Staff on the fourth floor postsurgical unit of a large hospital (N = 42) were ask to participate in an employee questionnaire \"nature contact questionnaire\". This 16-item nature environment questionnaire measures the amount and types of nature contact exposures employees have during a workweek. Majority of employees reported few, if any, nature contact exposures, specifically in the area of outdoor nature contacts with limited indoor and indirect contacts. These results indicated that employees on the fourth floor postsurgical floor have limited ability to reduce stress through nature contact exposures which could impact their perceived levels of work stress and stress-related behaviors and health outcomes. Nature contact exposures are both a relatively easy and an inexpensive way to improve employee stress. These findings indicate limitations to employees' exposure to nature contacts. Healthcare environments would benefit from a concerted effort to provide increased outdoor, indoor, and indirect nature contact exposures for employees. ","481":"This post occupancy evaluation (POE) assessed the impact of architectural design on psychosocial well-being among patients and staff in the context of a new complex continuing care and rehabilitation facility. Departing from typical POEs, the hospital design intentions formed the theoretical basis to assess outcomes. Intentions included creating an environment of wellness; enhancing connection to the community, the city, and nature; enhancing opportunities for social interaction; and inspiring activity. A pretest-posttest quasi experiment, including quantitative surveys, assessed the impact of the building design on well-being outcomes across three facilities-the new hospital, the former hospital, and a comparison facility with a similar population. With the exception of connection to neighborhood (for patients) and opportunities to visit with others (for staff) and wayfinding (for patients and staff), impressions of the new hospital mirrored the design intentions relative to the former hospital and the comparison facility among patients and staff. Perceptions of improvement in mental health, self-efficacy in mobility, satisfaction, and interprofessional interactions were enhanced at the new hospital relative to the former hospital, whereas optimism, depressive symptoms, general well-being, burnout, and intention to quit did not vary. Interestingly, patients and staff with favorable impressions of the building design fared better on most well-being-related outcomes relative to those with less favorable impressions. Beyond the value of assessing the impact of the design intentions on outcomes, the approach used in this study would benefit evaluation strategies across a diversity of health and other public and large-scale buildings. ","482":"Conducting high-quality design research in a mental health setting presents significant challenges, limiting the availability of high-quality evidence to support design decisions for built environments. Here, we outline key approaches to overcoming these challenges. In conducting a rigorous post-occupancy evaluation of a newly built mental health and addictions facility, St. Joseph's Healthcare, Hamilton, we identified a number of systematic barriers associated with conducting design research in mental health settings. Our approach to overcoming these barriers relied heavily upon (i) selecting established measures and methods with demonstrated efficacy in a mental health context, (ii) navigating institutional protocols designed to protect vulnerable members of this population, and (iii) designing innovative data collection strategies to increase participation in research by individuals with mental illness. Each of these approaches drew heavily on the expert knowledge of mental health settings and the experiences with mental health, facilities management, and research of a research team that was well integrated within the parent institution. Engaging multiple stakeholders (e.g., care providers, patients, ethics board, and hospital administrators) contributed their trust and support of the research. Traditionally, post-occupancy evaluation researchers are independent of the facilities they research, yet this is not an effective approach in mental health settings. We found that, in working toward solutions to the three obstacles we described, having team members who were well \"networked\" within the parent institution was necessary. This approach can turn \"gatekeepers\" into champions for patients' engagement in the research, which is essential in generating high-quality evidence. ","483":"This study investigates the perception of nurses about their lighting environment at medical-surgical hospital units in order to understand areas of improvement for lighting at these units. The bulk of the research about nurses and lighting is focused on nighttime nursing, exploring the disruptions of nurses' circadian rhythm and maintaining alertness. The understanding of nurses' perception about lighting and its impact on nurses' task performance and patient examination remains imprecise. This study used an online survey to ask a set of questions about lighting in medical-surgical units at five key locations including centralized nurse stations, decentralized nurse stations (DCNS), patient bedsides, patient bathrooms, and corridors from 393 survey participants. It then explored the survey findings in more depth through conducting focus groups with eight volunteer nurses. Lighting conditions at patient besides and DCNSs were significantly less desirable for nurses compared to other locations. A significant relationship between nurses' access to lighting controls (switches and dimmers) and satisfaction about the lighting environment was found. No significant relationship was observed between the individual characteristics of nurses (such as age, years of experience, etc.) and findings of this study. Thoughtful design of the lighting environment can improve nurses' satisfaction and perception about their working environment.

The impact of the build environment on user value is at the core of evidence-based design, but these values are normally only experienced by users after the building is constructed. Therefore, assessment of these values during the design phase could improve the outcome for patients. An analysis of available assessment tools showed that research by drawing and the use of space syntax methods is an adequate means to visualize the strengths and weaknesses of floor plans in relation to spatial user experience. This approach is illustrated by an assessment of a nursing ward of the Deventer hospital in the Netherlands. Floor plan analysis by using space syntax techniques makes it possible to visualize various aspects of user value and supports the incorporation of usability issues in the discussion between the designer, the client, and the users during the design process. It is recommended to test the findings of the design assessment by a post-occupancy evaluation of the building-in-use and to conduct similar studies in other hospitals, as a means to build a body of knowledge for user-oriented design and management of hospital buildings.

The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of healthcare professionals participating in group modeling utilizing system dynamics in the predesign phase of new healthcare environments. We engaged healthcare professionals in a series of workshops using system dynamics to discuss the planning of healthcare environments in the beginning of a construction and then interviewed them about their experience. An explorative and qualitative design was used to describe participants' experiences of participating in the group-modeling projects. Participants (N = 20) were recruited from a larger intervention study using group modeling and system dynamics in planning and designing projects. The interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Two themes were formed, representing the experiences in the group-modeling process: \"Participation in the group modeling generated knowledge and was empowering\" and \"Participation in the group modeling differed from what was expected and required the dedication of time and skills.\" The method can support participants in design teams to focus more on their healthcare organization, their care activities, and their aims rather than focusing on detailed layout solutions.

The subjects used in the study were randomly selected from among patients treated in the surgical medical sciences' departments of the hospital. Accordingly, a research questionnaire was applied to a total of 101 subjects. Results have shown that the three-person rooms were assessed more positively for privacy, functional, and perceptual qualifications compared to the six-person rooms. An increase in the number of persons and interior units of rooms affects negatively the auditory privacy and privacy areas of other patients.

Few studies have examined how employee readiness for change relates to adjustment outcomes typically captured in post-occupancy evaluation (POE). The relationship between organizational readiness and employee adjustment is examined in the context of a POE conducted during a hospital redevelopment. Our study focuses on the redevelopment of a complex continuing care and rehabilitation hospital that underwent complete physical redevelopment and major shifts in operational and organizational processes. Using a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental research design, staff organizational readiness was assessed using surveys at four time periods: 6 months prior to the move (n = 125), 2 months prior to the move (n = 84), 3 months after the move (n = 187), and 6 months after the move (n = 194). Measures included organizational readiness, workplace satisfaction, psychological factors (well-being and optimism), and sociodemographic information. Findings suggest readiness changes from pre- to post-move, with notable drops just prior (2 months) and just post (3 months) hospital move. Employees demonstrated significant increases in workplace satisfaction and interprofessional relationships from 6 months prior to the move to 6 months after. Results suggest that higher readiness is related to improved employee adjustment. A supportive change environment was found to encourage positive employee outcomes in the face of revolutionary change. It is recommended that change management activities be tailored not only to employee need but also to the timing of the change process.

Previous studies have shown that most forms of nature exposure have a positive influence on patients. However, earlier studies have mostly focused on wall-hung nature representations. The emergence of simulated nature products has raised the question regarding the effects of the new product on patient outcomes. A between-subject experimental design was adopted, where outcomes from five inpatient rooms with sky composition ceiling fixture were compared to corresponding outcomes in five identical rooms without the intervention. Data were collected from a total of 181 subjects on 11 outcomes. Independent sample tests were performed to identify differences in mean outcomes. Significant positive outcomes were observed in environmental satisfaction and diastolic blood pressure (BP). Environmental satisfaction in the experimental group was 12.4% higher than the control group. Direction of association for diastolic BP, nausea\/indigestion medication, acute stress, anxiety, pain, and environmental satisfaction were consistent with a priori hypothesis. A post hoc exploratory assessment involving patients who did not self-request additional pain and sleep medication demonstrated confirmatory directions for all outcomes except Systolic BP, and statistically significant outcomes for Acute Stress and Anxiety-Acute Stress and Anxiety levels of the experimental group subjects was 53.4% and 34.79% lower, respectively, than that of the control group subjects.

A growing evidence base suggests that the built environment can facilitate the delivery of patient- and family-centered care (PFCC). However, few studies examine how the PFCC model impacts the delivery of care, specifically the role of design in nurse-family interactions in the adult intensive care unit (ICU) from the perspective of the bedside nurse. Two neuro ICUs with the same patient population and staff, but with different layouts, were compared. Structured observations were conducted to assess changes in the frequency, location, and content of interactions between the two units. Discussions with staff provided additional insights into nurse attitudes, perceptions, and experiences caring for families. Nurses reported challenges balancing the needs of many stakeholders in a complex clinical environment, regardless of unit layout. However, differences in communication patterns between the clinician- and family-centered units were observed. More interactions were observed in nurse workstations in the PFCC unit, with most initiated by family. While the new unit was seen as more conducive to the delivery of PFCC, some nurses reported a loss of workspace control. Patient- and family-centered design created new spatial and temporal opportunities for nurse-family interactions in the adult ICU, thus supporting PFCC goals. However, greater exposure to unplanned family encounters may increase nurse stress without adequate spatial and organizational support. ","496":"Designers can and should play a critical role in shaping a holistic healthcare experience by creating empathetic design solutions that foster a culture of care for patients, families, and staff. Using narrative inquiry as a design tool, this case study shares strategies for promoting empathy. Designing for patient-centered care infuses empathy into the creative process. Narrative inquiry offers a methodology to think about and create empathetic design that enhances awareness, responsiveness, and accountability. This article shares discoveries from a studio on empathetic design within an outpatient cancer care center. The studio engaged students in narrative techniques throughout the design process by incorporating aural, visual, and written storytelling. Benchmarking, observations, and interviews were merged with data drawn from scholarly evidence-based design literature reviews. Using an empathy-focused design process not only motivated students to be more engaged in the project but facilitated the generation of fresh and original ideas. Design solutions were innovative and impactful in supporting the whole person. Similarities as well as differences defined empathetic cancer care across projects and embodied concepts of design empowerment, design for the whole person, and design for healing. By becoming more conscious of empathy, those who create healthcare environments can better connect holistically to the user to take an experiential approach to design. Explicitly developing a mind-set that raises empathy to the forefront of the design process offers a breakthrough in design thinking that bridges the gap between what might be defined as \"good design\" and patient-centered care. ","497":"To explore how hospital real estate can add value to the healthcare organization, which values are prioritized in practice, and why. Dutch healthcare organizations are self-responsible for the costs and benefits of their accommodation. Meanwhile, a lively debate is going on about possible added values of corporate and public real estate in the fields of corporate real estate management and facility management. This article connects both worlds and compares insights from literature with experiences from practice. Added values extracted from literature have been discussed with 15 chief executive officers and project leaders of recently newly built hospitals in the Netherlands. Interviewees were asked (1) which values are included in the design and management of their hospital and why, (2) to prioritize most important values from a list of nine predefined values, and (3) to explain how the chosen real estate decisions are supposed to support organizational objectives. Stimulating innovation, user satisfaction, and improving organizational culture are most highly valued, followed by improving productivity, reducing building costs, and creating building flexibility. Image, risk control, and financing possibilities got lower rankings. The findings have been used to develop a value-impact matrix that connects nine values to various stakeholders and possible interventions. The findings and the value-impact matrix can make different stakeholders aware of many possible added values of hospital real estate, potential synergy and conflicts between different values, and how to steer on value add in different phases of the life cycle. ","498":"The study investigated the main restorative components of staff break areas in healthcare facilities, by assessing usage patterns, verbal\/visual preferences, and perceived restorative qualities of specific design features found in break areas for hospital staff. Nurses are extremely important to the healthcare industry, and maintaining the quality of nursing care is a central concern for healthcare administrators. While healthcare leaders are concerned about improving nurses' satisfaction, performance, and job retention, they may overlook the importance of respite for nurses and underestimate the value of designing staff break areas to maximize their restorative potential. A multi-method approach combined qualitative explorations (focused interviews and narrative survey questions) with quantitative measurements (discrete survey questions and a visual ranking of break-room spaces), and the results were compared and triangulated. It was found that staff break areas are more likely to be used if they are in close proximity to nurses' work areas, if they have complete privacy from patients and families, and if they provide opportunities for individual privacy as well as socialization with coworkers. Having physical access to private outdoor spaces (e.g., balconies or porches) was shown to have significantly greater perceived restorative potential, in comparison with window views, artwork, or indoor plants. The results of this empirical study support the conclusion that improvements in the restorative quality of break areas may significantly improve nurses' satisfaction and stress reduction, potentially leading to improved care for the patients they serve. ","499":"To conduct an assessment of sound, dB(A) levels, in two areas of the hospital: patient rooms and nurse stations using sound meters (SMs). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends sound levels of 35 dB(A) during the day and 30 dB(A) during the night; however, many hospitals exceed these recommended levels. Assessing post-occupancy sound levels enables hospital administrators and healthcare workers to identify whether interventions to improve sound levels are needed. Sound assessments were conducted at three healthcare facilities in both patient rooms and nursing stations, and we include information on facility characteristics. An Amprobe SM-20A Sound Level Meter was placed for a 24-hr period and recorded decibel levels every 8 min. These sound levels were averaged for each hour for reporting purposes. Averages as well as highest and lowest readings are reported for both daytime (8 a.m.-10 p.m.) and nighttime (10 p.m.-8 a.m.) for each facility. All three sites are considered urban and are classified with the highest complexity level (1a). Average daytime measurements for patient rooms and their corresponding nurses stations were as follows: Site A-63 dB(A)\/56 dB(A), Site B-52 dB(A)\/55 dB(A), and Site C-42 dB(A)\/59 dB(A). Average nighttime measurements for patient rooms and nurses stations were Site A-62 dB(A)\/55 dB(A), Site B-48 dB(A)\/55 dB(A), and Site C-42 dB(A)\/60 dB(A). Our findings, considered independently and collectively, showed that facilities in this study exceeded the WHO-recommended sound levels for patient rooms of 35 dB(A) during daytime and 30 dB(A) during nighttime. Research has reported negative patient outcomes, for example, decreased satisfaction, sleep disturbance, and higher incidence of rehospitalization in patients staying in areas with higher noise levels.

Based on pilot findings of elevated ED particulate matter (PM) levels, investigators hypothesized that unhealthy aerosol materials derive from exogenous (vehicular) sources at ambulance receiving entrances. The Aerosol Environmental Toxicity in Healthcare-related Exposure and Risk program was conducted as an observational study. Calibrated sensors monitored PM and toxic gases at Ambulance Triage Exterior (ATE), Ambulance Triage Desk (ATD), and control Public Triage Desk (PTD) on a 3\/3\/3-day cycle. Cassette sampling characterized PM; meteorological and ambulance traffic data were logged. Descriptive and multiple linear regression analyses assessed for interactions between aerosol material levels, location, temporal variables, ambulance activity, and meteorological factors. Sensors acquired 93,682 PM0.3, 90,250 PM2.5, and 93,768 PM5 measurements over 366 days to generate a data set representing at least 85.6% of planned measurements. PM0.3, PM2.5, and PM5 mean counts were lowest in PTD; 56%, 224%, and 223% higher in ATD; and 996%, 200%, and 63% higher in ATE, respectively (all p &lt; .001). Qualitative analyses showed similar PM compositions in ATD and ATE. On multiple linear regression analysis, PM0.3 counts correlated primarily with location; PM2.5 and PM5 counts correlated most strongly with location and ambulance presence. PM &lt; 2.5 and toxic gas concentrations at ATD and PTD patient care areas did not exceed hazard levels; PM0.3 counts did not have formal safety thresholds for comparison. Higher levels of PM were linked with ED ambulance areas, although their health impact is unclear.

Components made of copper alloys were also found to be efficacious in a clinical trial. There are indications that bacteria found on frequently touched environmental surfaces play a role in infection transmission. In laboratory testing, copper alloy samples were inoculated with bacteria. In clinical trials, the amount of live bacteria on the surfaces of hospital components made of copper alloys, as well as those made from standard materials, was measured. Finally, infection rates were tracked in the hospital rooms with the copper components and compared to those found in the rooms containing the standard components. Greater than a 99.9% reduction in live bacteria was realized in laboratory tests. In the clinical trials, an 83% reduction in bacteria was seen on the copper alloy components, when compared to the surfaces made from standard materials in the control rooms. Finally, the infection rates were found to be reduced by 58% in patient rooms with components made of copper, when compared to patients' rooms with components made of standard materials. Bacteria die on copper alloy surfaces in both the laboratory and the hospital rooms. Infection rates were lowered in those hospital rooms containing copper components. Thus, based on the presented information, the placement of copper alloy components, in the built environment, may have the potential to reduce not only hospital-acquired infections but also patient treatment costs.

With mounting evidence to support the healing attributes of biophilic environments, we propose a method to identify biophilic content within interior spaces. Such a strategy offers much promise to the advancement of restorative environments. The BDM was based on Stephen Kellert's biophilic design attribute list and modified to be appropriate for interior environments, specifically children's healthcare spaces. A photo-ethnographic documentation method of 24 child life play spaces within a South Atlantic state was used to determine whether the BDM could reliably reveal biophilic features (listed as attributes by Kellert in 2008). This matrix appears useful in documenting biophilia within the pediatric healthcare context, attesting to the usability and functionality of the BDM for this special population. Specifically, the BDM revealed that biophilic attributes were constantly present in some spaces while others were completely absent. When a biophilic attribute was present, the BDM indicated that they varied considerably in type and occurrence. Thus, use of the BDM in the hospital areas designed for patient recreation and play successfully provided a visual inventory of biophilic features as well as the frequency of application. Further use of the BDM as a tool for strategizing biophilic feature inclusion can thus increase the connections available with nature in the interior, beneficial for optimizing health and wellness.

In addition to providing a healing space for patients, hospital patient rooms need to serve as functional workplaces for the people who provide clinical care, to clean, or to maintain room functions. Therefore, from a design perspective, it is important to understand the needs of all the users of hospital patient rooms with regard to room design. One hundred forty-seven people, representing 23 different occupational stakeholder groups, participated in either focus groups or interviews in which they were asked to identify room design issues that affect the performance of their work tasks. Key issues shared across multiple stakeholder groups included an inability to have eye contact with the patient when entering the room, inadequate space around the bed for the equipment used by stakeholders, the physical demands experienced as stakeholders move furnishings to accomplish their activities or access equipment, and a lack of available horizontal surfaces. Unique issues were also identified for a number of stakeholder groups. There are a number of issues that should be addressed in the next generation of hospital patient rooms, or when refurbishing existing facilities, so that all occupational stakeholder groups can work effectively, efficiently, and without undue physical stress.

The medical center is gradually renewing its hospital building area of 200,000 m.(2) This redevelopment is carefully planned and because lessons learned can guide design decisions of the next phase, the medical center is keen to evaluate the performance of the new buildings. A pre- and post-study with a control group was conducted. Prior to the move to the new buildings an occupancy evaluation was carried out in the old setting (n = 729) (pre-study). Post occupation of the new buildings another occupancy evaluation (post-study) was carried out in the new setting (intervention group) and again in some old settings (control group) (n = 664). The occupancy evaluation consisted of an online survey that measured the perceived performance of different aspects of the building. Longitudinal multilevel analysis was used to compare the performance of the old buildings with the new buildings. Significant improvements were found in indoor climate, perceived safety, working environment, well-being, facilities, sustainability, and overall satisfaction. Commitment to the employer, working atmosphere, orientation, work performance, and knowledge sharing did not improve. The results were interpreted by relating them to specific design choices. We showed that it is possible to measure the performance improvements of a complex intervention being a new building design and validate design decisions. A focused design process aiming for a safe, pleasant and sustainable building resulted in actual improvements in some of the related performance measures.

The proposed framework pairs EBD with value-driven decision making and aims to improve communication among stakeholders by providing a common analytical language. Recent EBD research indicates that the design and operation of healthcare facilities contribute to an organization's operational success by improving safety, quality, and efficiency. However, because little information is available about the financial returns of evidence-based investments, such investments are readily eliminated during the capital-investment decision-making process. To model the proposed framework, we used engineering economy tools to evaluate the return on investments in six successful cases, identified by a literature review, in which facility design and operation interventions resulted in reductions in hospital-acquired infections, patient falls, staff injuries, and patient anxiety. In the evidence-based cases, calculated net present values, internal rates of return, and payback periods indicated that the long-term benefits of interventions substantially outweighed the intervention costs. This article explained a framework to develop a research-based and value-based communication language on specific interventions along the planning, design and construction, operation, and evaluation stages. Evidence-based and value-based design frameworks can be applied to communicate the life-cycle costs and savings of EBD interventions to stakeholders, thereby contributing to more informed decision makings and the optimization of healthcare infrastructures.

Staff within FQHCs face many challenges that can significantly impact their HRQoL. Design features directed toward reducing stress have been shown to improve staff health outcomes in acute care environments. However, minimal literature exists linking design features to health outcomes within FQHCs. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted involving three FQHCs that contain varying levels of enhancements to their interior features. A total of 75 staff across the sites participated in the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) survey, measuring satisfaction and perceived productivity. Measurements for staff HRQoL were captured using the quality of well-being (QWB) scale, which was administered to 10 staff at each site. Standard regression diagnostics were used to examine fit and find influential observations. QWB scores were normally distributed, and a dose-response relationship was found between QWB scores and level of enhancements. As the categories of satisfaction and perceived productivity increased, the average QWB score increased. Regression models showed overall statistical significance and predicted between a quarter to a half of the change in QWB scores. This pilot study suggests that the more enhancements included in the interior features of a FQHC, the greater the returns to staff HRQoL. Findings also suggest that staff with a lower QWB appreciate enhancements more. Design strategies associated with improved staff well-being should be evaluated in terms of the amount of HRQoL they contribute.

Using operational data and staff input, patient and staff flow models were created, identifying bottlenecks (points of inefficiency). A new flow model of emergency care delivery, physician-directed queuing, was developed. Expanding upon physicians in triage, providers passively evaluate all patients upon arrival, actively manage patients requiring fewer resources, and direct patients requiring complex resources to further evaluation in ED areas. Sustained over time, ED efficiency improved as measured by near elimination of \"left without being seen\" patients and waiting times with improvement in door to doctor, patient satisfaction, and total length of stay. All improvements were in the setting on increased patient volume and no increase in physician staffing.

Older people who wish to age in place are faced with the challenge of adapting their domestic environment to ensure independence, accessibility, and social connectivity. This is even more challenging for people with dementia who continue to live at home, given the risks of self-harm and getting lost. More imaginative and inclusive forms of collective housing are needed. For people with dementia, a move to a new environment is often a stressful experience that causes shock, withdrawal, and anger. Hence, more research is needed to develop more fitting long-term housing options for people with dementia. This article presents a brief review on housing choices and housing design for people with dementia. Interviews with managers of 22 care homes were conducted to explore housing choices and design issues. Results show that the main housing choices available to people with dementia offer different levels of care. The choice of care homes relates to the atmosphere of a home as some occupants favor a homely or relaxing environment and others prefer dynamic settings. A combination of appropriate level of care, a good atmosphere, and design quality within the care home are elements that lead to a more enabling environment.

An analysis of construction project resources (e.g., infection control regulations and room data sheets) was combined with semi-structured interviews with hospital client employees and design and construction professionals to provide valuable insights into the management of infection control issues. Infection control requirements are representationally indistinct but also omnipresent through all phases of the construction project life cycle: Failure to recognize their nature, relevance, and significance can result in delays, stoppages, and redesign work. Construction project resources (e.g., regulatory guidance and room data sheets) can mask or obscure the meaning of infection control issues.

This study provides an inventory of patient items located on the over-the-bed table and in\/on the nightstand. Understanding the functions of furnishings within the patient room is key for future preparation for designing a next-generation over-the-bed table or for redesigning a more useful nightstand. The contents on the top of the nightstand; the contents in the top, middle, and bottom drawers of the nightstand; items next to the nightstand; and the contents on the over-the-bed table within patient rooms were inventoried and placed into categories using similar, patient item categories as the Brooks et al. (2011) study, which examined the contents of the nightstand and the over-the-bed table in assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. Overall, patients in a rehabilitation hospital had a greater percentage of their belongings on the top of the nightstand as compared to their belongings located in all three combined drawers of the nightstand.

The design of the physical setting is an important and contributing factor for creating a service climate in organizations. Service climate is defined as employee perceptions of the practices, procedures, and behaviors that get rewarded, supported, and expected with regard to customer service and customer service quality. There has been research conducted which identifies antecedents within organization that promotes a positive service climate which in turn creates service-oriented behaviors by employees toward clients. The antecedent of the physical setting and its impact on perceptions of service climate has been less commonly explored. Using the concept of the physical service setting (which may be defined as aspects of the physical, built environment that facilitate the delivery of quality service), attributes of the physical setting and their relationship with service climate were explored by means of a quantitative paper survey distributed to emergency nurses (n = 180) throughout a province in Canada. The results highlight the validity and reliability of six scales measuring the physical setting and its relation to service. Respondents gave low ratings to the physical setting of their departments, in addition to low ratings of service climate. Respondents feel that the design of the physical setting in the emergency departments where they work is not conducive to providing quality service to clients. Certain attributes of the physical setting were found to be significant in influencing perceptions of service climate, hence service quality, within the emergency department setting.

Environmental factors, such as attractiveness and function, have the potential to improve patients' experiences. Participatory qualitative methods allow researchers to explore the environment and facilitate discussion. Guided tours were conducted with 25 health care providers\/employees at two Veterans Affairs (VA) health care facilities. In guided tours, participants lead the researcher through an environment, commenting on their surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. The researcher walks along with the participant, asking open-ended questions as needed to foster discussion and gain an understanding of the participant's view. Participants were asked to walk through the facility as though they were a veteran. Tours were audio recorded, with participant permission, and transcribed verbatim by research assistants. Three qualitative researchers were responsible for codebook development and coding transcripts and used data-driven coding approaches. Participants discussed physical appearance of the environment and how that influences perceptions about care. Overall, participants highlighted the need to shed the \"institutional\" appearance. Differences between VA and non-VA health care facilities were discussed, including availability of private rooms and staff to assist with navigating the facility. They reviewed resources in the facility, such as the information desk to assist patients and families. Finally, they offered suggestions for future improvements, including improvements to waiting areas and quiet areas for patients to relax and \"get away\" from their rooms.

The growth of ambulatory medical care makes outpatient facilities the primary point of health care contact for many Americans. However, the outpatient consultation room design remains largely unchanged, despite its increased use and the adoption of technology-mediated information sharing in clinical encounter. A randomized controlled trial used a postvisit questionnaire to assess six domains of interest (satisfaction with the visit and the consultation room, mutual respect, patient trust in the physician, communication quality, people-room interaction, and interpersonal-room interaction) in two different room designs (a traditional room and an experimental room in which a pedestal table had replaced the examination table). Interpersonal-room interaction was enhanced in the experimental consultation room when compared to the traditional consultation room (p = .0038). Participants in the experimental consultation room had better access to the computer screen, increased provider information sharing, and more time engaging providers in conversation about information on the monitor. Changing the layout of a consultation room has the potential to improve interpersonal communication through better information sharing. Clinicians who are interested in maximizing the benefits of their clinical encounter should consider changing the layout of their consultation room, especially the positioning of the computer screen.

More than 500 international studies and conference proceedings were incorporated in this literature review. A team of five research assistants searched multiple databases comparing approximately 16 keywords to geographic location. Some of those keywords included: evidence-based design, salutogenic design, design research, and healthcare environment. Additional articles were gathered by contacting prominent researchers and asking for their personal assessment of local health design research studies. While there are design researchers in most parts of the world, the majority of studies focus on the needs of populations in developed countries and generate guidelines that have significant cost and cultural implications that prohibit their implementation in developing countries. Additionally, the body of literature discussing the role of culture in healthcare environments is extremely limited. Design researchers must address the cultural implications of their studies.

Architects and designers will be provided with credible evidence on which they can confidently base their design decisions. Researchers will be able to determine which environmental aspects have been well investigated and where there are gaps in the current state of the research. A great number of studies have established a relationship between the design of the physical environment of long-term care settings and outcomes of people with dementia. However, the methods employed are heterogeneous and the results are often conflicting. Consequently, the process of integrating the best evidence available into architectural designs may be hindered. A systematic literature search was conducted reviewing studies that meet certain inclusion criteria. Using an evidence-based approach, the methodical quality of the studies was rated. One hundred sixty-nine studies were found. They were thematically summarized into four main categories: basic design decisions, environmental attributes, ambience, and environmental information. The effectiveness of the interventions on the behavior, cognition, function, well being, social abilities, orientation, and care outcomes on people with dementia was illustrated by matrices. Results of this review indicate that, with the exception of cognition, specific design interventions are beneficial to the outcomes of people with dementia.

Fourteen healthcare subject matter experts and eight research and design subject matter experts engaged in a participatory and iterative research and design process. A mixed methods qualitative approach used methodological triangulation to confirm the value of the findings and ratings to establish importance. Open and closed card sorts and a Delphi study were used. Data analysis methods included frequency analysis, content analysis, and a modified Kano analysis. A table demonstrating the needs that are of high importance to both groups of subject matter experts and classification of the design challenges each represents was produced. Through this process, the list of 74 needs was refined to the 37 most important need statements for both groups. Designing a more useful, usable, and actively assistive over-the-bed table is primarily about the ability to position it optimally with respect to the user for any task, as well as improving ease of use and usability.

The healthcare construction industry in China is one of the fastest growing sectors in China and, arguably, in the world. Understanding the physical design of acute care units in China is of great importance because it will influence a large population. Descriptive study was performed of unit configuration, size, patient visibility, distance to nursing station and supplies, and lighting conditions in 25 units in 19 public hospitals built after 2003. Data and information were collected based on spatial and visibility analysis. The study identified major design characteristics of the recently built (from 2003 onward) acute care units in China, comparing them, where appropriate, with those in U.S. It found there are three dominant types of unit layout: single-corridor (52%), triangular (36%), and double-corridor (12%). The number of private rooms is very low (11%), compared with two- or three-bed rooms. Centralized nursing stations are the only type of nurses' working area. China also has a large unit size in terms of number of patient beds. The average number of patient beds in a unit is 40.6 in China (versus 32.9 in U.S.). The care units in China have longer walking distance from nursing station to patient bedside. The percentage of beds visible from a nursing station is lower in China than in the U.S. The access to natural light and direct sunlight in patient rooms is greater in China compared with those in U.S.-100% of patient rooms in China have natural lighting.

We studied the perception of using the instrument on a group of space planners. The study is part of a larger project designed to ensure the quality of the planning of new healthcare environments with a focus on documents (programs or briefs) created in the early phases of the planning process. In this study, we used an instrument that measures the clarity of the mission statement for the project based on user needs and care activities that will take place in the new healthcare environment. The instrument further evaluates whether there are clear patient-related outcome measures specified and whether the information in the documents is person-oriented and evidence-based. The study used a mixed-method design where the relevance and usability of the instrument was estimated and a focus group interview was conducted. The study showed that a CQB-I is perceived to be a relevant instrument primarily as a guide for programming, but also for monitoring the produced programs.

Reorganization and redevelopment of a hospital is a complex activity that involves many stakeholders and demands. Visualization and simulation tools have proven useful for involving practitioners and eliciting relevant knowledge. More knowledge is desired about how these tools can be implemented in practice for hospital planning processes. A participatory planning process including practitioners and researchers was executed over a 3-year period to evaluate a combination of visualization and simulation tools to involve stakeholders in the planning process and to elicit knowledge about needs and requirements. The initial clinic proposal from the architect was discarded as a result of the empirical study. Much general knowledge about the needs of the organization was extracted by means of the adopted tools. Some of the tools proved to be more accessible than others for the practitioners participating in the study. The combination of tools added value to the process by presenting information in alternative ways and eliciting questions from different angles.

These facilities set important precedents for design teams seeking operational examples for achieving aggressive energy and interior environmental quality goals. This examination of operational hospitals is intended to offer hospital owners, designers, and building managers a strong case and concrete framework for strategies to achieve exceptionally high performing buildings. Energy efficient hospitals have the potential to significantly impact the U.S.'s overall energy profile, and key stakeholders in the hospital industry need specific, operationally grounded precedents in order to successfully implement informed energy reduction strategies. This study is an outgrowth of previous research evaluating high quality, low energy hospitals that serve as examples for new high performance hospital design, construction, and operation. Through extensive interviews, numerous site visits, the development of case studies, and data collection, this team has established thorough qualitative and quantitative analyses of several contemporary hospitals in Scandinavia and the Pacific Northwest. Many Scandinavian hospitals demonstrate a low energy profile, and when analyzed in comparison with U.S. hospitals, such Scandinavian precedents help define the framework required to make significant changes in the U.S. hospital building industry. Eight hospitals, four Scandinavian and four Pacific Northwest, were quantitatively compared using the Environmental Protection Agency's Portfolio Manager, allowing researchers to answer specific questions about the impact of energy source and architectural and mechanical strategies on energy efficiency in operational hospitals. Specific architectural, mechanical, and plant systems make these Scandinavian hospitals more energy efficient than their Pacific Northwest counterparts. More importantly, synergistic systems integration allows for their significant reductions in energy consumption. This quantitative comparison of operational Scandinavian and Pacific Northwest hospitals resulted in compelling evidence of the potential for deep energy savings in the U.S., and allowed researchers to outline specific strategies for achieving such reductions.

The practice of midwifery has significant influence on the experiences and health outcomes of childbearing women. In the developed world most midwifery takes place in hospitals. The design and aesthetics of the hospital birth environment have an effect on midwives and inevitably play a role in shaping their practice. Despite this, knowledge about midwives' own thoughts and feelings regarding the design of hospital birth environments is limited. An exploratory descriptive methodology was used and 16 face-to-face photo-elicitation interviews were conducted with practicing midwives. Audio recordings were made of the interviews and they were transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis, informed by the theoretical framework of critical realism, was undertaken. Midwives identified cognitive and emotional responses to varied birth environments and were able to describe the way in which these responses influenced their practice. The overarching theme of \"messages from space\" was developed along with three sub-themes: messages, feelings, and behaviors. Midwives' responses aligned with the three domains of a critical realist world-view and indicated that a relationship existed between hospital birth environments and midwifery practice.

Two units with centralized nursing stations and two units with decentralized nursing stations were compared in terms of the application of communication technologies. A total of 70 registered nurses completed the survey in a 2-week period. The results revealed no significant differences between centralized and decentralized nursing stations in terms of frequency of communication technologies used. However, a difference was found between perception of nurses toward communication technologies and perceptions of the use of communication technologies in decentralized nursing stations.

Various studies attribute healthcare outcomes (patient falls, satisfaction) to a vague notion of patient room visibility. The study by Leaf and colleagues was the first to draw an independent association between patient mortality and patient room visibility, however \"visibility\" remains imprecise. The original patient dataset was obtained from Dr. Leaf. The 664 patient sample assigned across 12 rooms at the medical ICU at Columbia University Medical Center was reanalyzed in terms of targeted visibility; the unit of analysis was the room, n = 12. Several computer-based visibility measures of patient rooms were used: patient head visibility, patient room visibility, and field of view to nursing station. Patient head visibility was defined as the percentage of area within the central nursing station from which the patient head could be seen; patient room visibility was defined as the percentage of area within the central nursing station that could see the patient room (average value of all patient room grids); field of view was defined as the maximum viewing angle from the patient head to the central nursing station. Among the sickest patients (those with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II &gt; 30), field of view accounted for 33.5% of the variance in ICU mortality, p = 0.049.

Beginning with the dominant medical culture of hospitals, coupled with a persistent skepticism of social and in particular, qualitative research and its contribution to knowledge in medical circles, restrictive contextual challenges also include attitudinal, methodological, and logistical considerations. Together, these challenges hamper good participatory research practice and the capacity to maintain quality data, as well as impede children's participation in research, which has the capacity to contribute to healthcare design, policy, and planning processes. Two studies in pediatric settings in Australia, one of which was completed in 2008 and the other which was discontinued in 2011, provide the basis for this research discussion. The discussion addresses the issues that persist in inhibiting the completion of participatory social research and the resulting impacts on research, children's right to participate, and the volume of evidence that is ultimately available from children's perspectives to support and inform healthcare design, planning, and policy in pediatric settings. Recommendations for changes that could strengthen and improve this research experience include building awareness of the potential value of this research; increasing its influence; building the capacity and knowledge of gatekeepers, ethics committees, and researchers working in this context; and recognizing and valuing children's competence and participation.

We discuss the methods in a larger framework of change process model and participatory design. Rehabilitation organizations are currently in transition; customer groups, financing, services, and the processes of rehabilitation centers are changing. The pressure for change challenges the centers to develop both their processes and facilities. There is a need for methods that support change management. Four participatory methods were developed: future workshop, change survey, multi-method assessment tool, and participatory design generator cards. They were tested and evaluated in three rehabilitation centers at the different phases of their change process. The developed methods were considered useful in creating a mutual understanding of the change goals between different stakeholders, providing a good picture of the work community's attitudes toward the change, forming an integrated overview of the built and perceived environment, inspiring new solutions, and supporting the management in steering the change process. The change process model described in this article serves as a practical framework that combined the viewpoints of organizational and facility development. However, participatory design continues to face challenges concerning communication between different stakeholders, and further development of the methods and processes is still needed.

Even though critical care practice has already undergone significant changes in the last few decades, it is still an evolving domain of medical practice. As a result, ICU design is also evolving as new regulatory standards, new technologies, and new clinical models are being introduced. A good understanding of the above issues regarding space allocation may help us better guide the evolution of ICU design. The study includes a set of 25 adult ICUs that were recognized between 1993 and 2012 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), the American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACCN), and the American Institute of Architects Academy of Architecture for Health (AIA AAH) for their efforts to promote healing of the critically ill and injured patients through the design of the critical care unit environment. The study finds notable differences in space allocation among different generic categories of functions between the ICUs of the first decade (1993-2002) and the second decade (2003-2012). The study also finds notable differences in space allocation among different generic categories of functions in relation to size, construction type, specialty type, and layout type.

The positive impact of nature images on health outcomes traditionally has been measured using behavioral and physiological indicators. However, there is a lack of understanding of the underlying neural mechanism that explains this positive influence. A combination of behavioral responses and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology was used to address research questions. Ten participants belonging to five age groups were subjected to short (25 seconds) exposures of 32 images while their brain activation was monitored via the BOLD response. In a separate run, participants were subjected to extended exposures (12 minutes) of a sky composition and an image of a traditional ceiling. The results show that the activation patterns produced by sky compositions and positive images were quite similar as compared to negative or neutral images. However, sky compositions also produced some unique areas of activation, including those associated with spatial cognition, the expanse of space, circadian rhythm, and perceived motion. In the extended exposure condition, sky compositions tended to activate regions associated with dreaming, while traditional ceiling images activated regions that are related to face processing and potentially visual hallucinations. Nature stimuli, with a combination of vegetation and sky, may produce unique beneficial effects not present in general positive stimuli.

The overview of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) tool with examples of its application in hospital building projects will demonstrate the benefit of those structured conversations. This article illustrates how two hospitals used FMEA when integrating operational processes with building projects: (1) adjacency decision for Intensive Care Unit (ICU); and (2) distance concern for handling of specimens from Surgery to Lab. Both case studies involved interviews that exposed facility solution concerns. Just-in-time studies using the FMEA followed the same risk assessment process with the same workshop facilitator involving structured conversations in analyzing risks. In both cases, participants uncovered key areas of risk enabling them to take the necessary next steps. While the focus of this article is not the actual design solution, it is apparent that the risk assessment brought clarity to the situations resulting in prompt decision making about facility solutions. Hospitals are inherently risky environments; therefore, use of the formal risk assessment process, FMEA, is an opportunity for design professionals to apply more rigor to design decision making when facility solutions impact operations in high risk areas.

Chaudhury, Mahmood, &amp; Valente (2009) reviewed a number of design considerations related to reducing errors by nursing staff in acute care settings. The Neurological Rehabilitation Unit (NRU) at one hospital served to further examine the design recommendations outlined by Chaudhury et al. (2009). Based on photographs, a site tour, interviews with the NRU manager and with the son of a patient of 5 months, comparisons were made between the NRU and the acute care setting design considerations reviewed by Chaudhury et al. (2009). The NRU appeared to comply with many recommendations: enforced noise reduction was facilitated through limiting both the number of patients per room and the number of patients admitted to the unit. Distinct rooms were used for various tasks that helped to contain activity-based noise. A combination of daylighting and artificial lighting was in place, but efforts to control glare and thermal comfort were not integrated into the design. The ergonomic needs of employees were incorporated in the design of the NRU, and the layouts of patient rooms and the layout of the NRU in general also were compatible with the design recommendations reviewed by Chaudhury et al.

By standardizing assessment, intervention, and post-fall investigation processes the goal was to decrease patient falls and falls with injury rate by 50% and 30%, respectively. Preventing patients from being injured due to a fall during their hospitalization has been a concern in healthcare for many years. Organizations around the world such as Institute of Medicine, The Joint Commission, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, National Australian Patient Safety Foundation, and the World Health Organization have been conducting research and publishing guidelines to identify evidence based interventions for fall prevention (Ulrich et al., 2008, Di Pilla, 2010). Falls are the most common cause of non-fatal injury and hospital admission for trauma. Death rates due to falls have risen sharply over the past decade due to aging of the population. A Rapid Improvement Event (RIE) technique was selected to implement the fall prevention initiative because it aligned with the hospital's lean transformation initiative. There was coordination with other departmental staff (physical and occupational therapy, pharmacy, physicians, information systems, low bed equipment vendor, and clinical operations) to achieve multidisciplinary input. A 22% decrease in total fall rate and a 37% decrease in falls with injury rate were achieved in the 16-month post-intervention period. Although a 22% decrease in total falls did not meet the goal of 50% decrease, the total falls with injury decrease of 37% did exceed the goal of 30%. Falls are a multi-faceted, complex problem that needs constant vigilance and continuous improvement to sustain patient safety. Anticipating physiologic changes in patients' conditions and implementing interventions before the fall is critical to fall prevention. While well-validated screening tools performed thoroughly and accurately can help hospital staff identify patient specific fall risk factors, risk assessment alone does not prevent falls. If the prevention of patient falls is identified as important by leadership and staff at the division level and all are invested in achieving established goals, success can be achieved and sustained.

To a large extent healthcare providers depend on their patients' willingness to disclose information. In addition to characteristics related to the physician and topic of conversation, research indicates that environmental factors influence patients' affective experiences and self-disclosure. A two-factor between-subjects experimental design was used in which participants (n = 90) were presented with a scenario describing a patient-physician encounter varying in communicated threat. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a picture in which room brightness was manipulated. Next, patient comfort, experienced spaciousness, and self-disclosure intentions were measured. An effect of brightness was found on affective experiences and self-disclosure intentions. In addition, the predicted interaction was obtained between brightness and communicated threat on these measures. Analyses confirmed that perceived spaciousness mediates the relationship between room brightness and self-disclosure intentions. The study confirms that brightness impacts self-disclosure intentions. Additionally, this relationship is influenced by psychological circumstances, with a more pronounced need for spaciousness when in an anxious state of mind.

Flexibility in healthcare construction projects is increasingly needed in order to deal with growing uncertainties. Until now, little research has been carried out on how and to what extent flexibility is incorporated in different types of project coalitions chosen by healthcare organizations. An exploratory survey was conducted among health organizations in both cure and care. Questions were asked on the position of the real estate department within the organization, the type of project coalitions chosen and the rationale behind this choice, and the extent to which flexibility in terms of a real option was considered and to what extent it had been exercised in a project coalition. Integrated project coalitions pay more attention to flexibility in advance in both the process and the product, but exercise them to a lesser extent than separated project coalitions. The economic feasibility of real options is higher in integrated project coalitions.

The evidence-based design (EBD) approach for healthcare facilities has been widely embraced by both designers and researchers in recent years; however, there are some limitations concerning knowledge categorization and acquisition of EBD. These limitations include an overemphasis on empirical knowledge gained by experimental research, a narrow focus that excludes design knowledge generated outside healthcare and allied fields, and a lack of interest in empirical knowledge gained by qualitative studies. In order to overcome these limitations, the proponents of EBD must acknowledge that design knowledge relevant to healthcare design can be found in disciplines unrelated to healthcare; that design knowledge does not always need empirical validation; and that design knowledge of the semantic kind can be more easily accessed and understood through qualitative studies. To reassess the foundations of knowledge of EBD with moderated skepticism is necessary because there are philosophical and analytical problems yet to be overcome in delivering on the promises of EBD. To question and reassess the foundations of knowledge base of EBD is not necessarily to deny its value, but rather to stimulate a judicious and balanced appraisal of its limitations so that, in future, we are able to take necessary steps to overcome these limitations.

As hospitals have become more patient-centered, there has been a trend toward including a family area inside the patient area to promote family presence, support, and involvement in patient care. There is growing evidence that family members play an important role in supporting patient care, and that the physical environment affects family involvement. However, few empirical studies have attempted to show the effectiveness of the patient-centered design on family members' presence and their behavior. This study compared the degree of family presence and family-patient and family-staff interactions in two intensive care units (ICUs) with different physical environmental conditions, but housing patients of similar acuity and disease type. The analysis identified a significant difference in family presence in patient rooms (t = -2.176; df = 79.0; p = 0.03) between the traditional and the patient-centered units.

Structured interviews incorporating both forced choice and free response questions were administered to the volunteers-healthcare providers and patients at a rehabilitation hospital. While the overbed tabletop and extendable tray are heavily used, all other features of the overbed table models are rarely used. Usability of the models exhibits the potential for improvement. Healthcare providers' and patients' feature preferences differ and occasionally conflict. Existing overbed tables are valued primarily for the top surface. Other features and functions of the overbed table present opportunities for refinement of design, durability, and usability. There are strong patterns of agreement and disagreement in the preferences of healthcare providers and patients with respect to overbed table design, use, features, and functionality. There is potential to improve overbed table designs from both the perspectives of the staff and the patient.

The focus of this study is on leveraging the synergy between organizational management strategies and environmental design interventions. This paper proposes a framework for linking the built environment with the human resource management system of healthcare organizations. The framework focuses on the impact of the built environment regarding job attitudes and behaviors of healthcare workers. Research from the disciplines of strategic human resource management, resource-based view of firms, evidence-based design, and green building are utilized to develop the framework. The positive influence of human resource practices on job attitudes and behaviors of employees is one mechanism to improve organizational performance outcomes. Organizational psychologists suggest that human resource practices are effective because they convey that the organization values employee contributions and cares about their well-being. Attention to employee socio-emotional needs can be reciprocated with higher levels of motivation and commitment toward the organization. In line with these findings, healthcare environmental studies imply that physical settings and features can have a positive influence on job attitudes and the behavior of caregivers by providing for their physical and socio-emotional needs. Adding the physical environment as a complementary resource to the array of human resource practices creates synergy in improving caregivers' job attitudes and behaviors and enhances the human capital of healthcare firms.

Previous studies have revealed that hospital medical directors-senior physicians in the management positions with high-demand jobs in clinical practices and management-had a lower self-rated health. This was a cross-sectional survey study and 737 hospital medical directors in Taiwan were included. A developed and structured questionnaire covered the dimensions of patient-related work stress (i.e., physician-patient relationship stress and patient condition stress), hospital interior amenities (i.e., indoor plants, aquarium, music, art and exhibitions, and private or personalized spaces that are common or surround the workplace of healthcare professionals), and self-rated health status and health complaints. Hierarchical regressions were performed. Hospital medical directors' physician-patient relationship stresses were found to have more negative effects on their self-reported health status and complaints than do their patient condition stresses; however, only indoor plants were found to have moderating effects on their short-term health complaints (p &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, the hospital medical directors' patient condition stresses were negatively related to their short-term health complaints; however, music, art and exhibitions, and private or personalized spaces in the workplaces had moderating effects (p &lt; 0.05). Considering the unavoidable patient-related work stresses imposed on hospital medical directors, some proposed interior amenities can produce buffering effects on work stress to some extent.

The ADA Accessibility Guidelines were developed primarily to address the needs of disabled populations, such as returning Vietnam veterans, with sufficient upper body strength to transfer independently directly from a wheelchair to the toilet. However, the majority of older persons with disabilities (90%) stand to transfer to the toilet, rather than laterally moving from the wheelchair to the toilet. The research used a repeated measures research design to evaluate caregiver responses during assisted toileting for various toilet configurations. The study included 20 patients who were transferred onto and off of a toilet for each of four different configurations by one or two caregivers. Toileting trials were videotaped and analyzed by an occupational therapist. Additionally, caregivers completed five-question, self-report surveys after each toileting trial. Survey data indicate that staff members prefer the largest of the tested configurations, where the centerline of the toilet is 30 inches from the sidewall, rather than the 18 inches required by the ADAAG, and where there are two fold-down grab bars provided. Caregivers perceived the grab bar locations as better for helping them safely transfer subjects in a modified (non-ADAAG) configuration, and also that the grab bar style in a modified configuration (non-ADAAG) improved safety when transferring subjects. Although caregivers were observed to safely transfer residents to and from the toilet for all configurations tested, regulations regarding accessibility of patient bathrooms should acknowledge the perceived benefits of increasing the distance from the sidewall to the centerline of the toilet to as much as 30 inches and allowing two fold-down grab bars instead of the required sidewall and back-wall grab bars.

Nineteen elderly but cognitively intact residents of an assisted living facility participated in the study. They were exposed to three landscaped spaces: a Japanese style garden, an herb garden, and a simple landscaped area planted with a single tree. To assess the effect of different landscaped spaces on older adults, individuals were monitored for mood and cardiac function in response to short exposures to spaces. Mood state was assessed using Profile of Mood States (POMS) before and after viewing the spaces. Cardiac output was assessed using a portable electrocardiograph monitor before and during the viewing. We found that the structured gardens evoked greater responses in all outcome measures. Scores on the POMS improved after observation of the two organized gardens compared to responses to the simple landscaped space with a single tree. During the observation period, heart rate was significantly lower in the Japanese garden than in the other environments, and sympathetic function was significantly lower as well. We conclude that exposure to organized gardens can affect both the mood and cardiac physiology of elderly individuals.

Design evidence base for one use-value: sleep. A literature review considers the evidence currently found regarding the value of sleep for hospital inpatients and the actual quality of inpatient sleep. Intrinsic and extrinsic reasons for shortened or poor sleep are reviewed, with an emphasis on environmental considerations. There are many manners in which designers and caregivers are aware that good sleeping conditions can be provided; therefore it is by choice, albeit unwittingly, that poor sleeping conditions have arisen. The value of sleep to hospital inpatients is very high, even in the short term. Inpatients' sleep is currently not as good as it could or should be.

A 2006 empirical study to identify domains of design decisions that affect flexibility on inpatient units found some indication in the context of the acuity-adaptable operational model that factors extraneous to the design process could have negatively influenced the successful implementation of the model. This raised questions regarding extraneous factors that might influence the successful optimization of flexibility. An exploratory, qualitative method was adopted to examine the question. Stakeholders from five recently built acute care inpatient units participated in the study, which involved three types of data collection: (1) verbal protocol data from a gaming session; (2) in-depth semi-structured interviews; and (3) shadowing frontline personnel. Data collection was conducted between June 2009 and November 2010. The study revealed at least nine factors extraneous to the design process that have the potential to hinder the optimization of flexibility in four domains: (1) systemic; (2) cultural; (3) human; and (4) financial. Flexibility is critical to hospital operations in the new healthcare climate, where cost reduction constitutes a vital target. From this perspective, flexibility and efficiency strategies can be influenced by (1) return on investment, (2) communication, (3) culture change, and (4) problem definition. Extraneous factors identified in this study could also affect flexibility in other care settings; therefore, these findings may be viewed from the overall context of hospital design. ","642":"To confirm a new method for the research question, \"How do different hospital unit layouts affect nurses' walking behavior and distance?\" Concern is renewed regarding nurses' long walking distances because of the trend toward larger patient rooms with family areas inside, resulting in a larger overall unit size. Studies have found unit design characteristics that support nurses' efficient walking, but few have done it in units designed for patient- and family-centered care. To examine the effect of unit design on nurses' walking behavior, the authors propose a new method of observing a specific task. The authors observed nurses during the task of medication administration. Contrary to their hypotheses, results showed: (1) Experienced nurses had more unnecessary stops and longer walking distances than new nurses because of interactions; and (2) nurses in the smaller wing of the unit walked more than those in the larger wing of the same unit. The authors posit that the closeness between the nurses' path to the medication supply room and the central nurses' station affected the frequency of interactions and prompted a deviation from the shortest and most efficient path during medication administration. Observing a specific task to identify the effect of unit layout was effective, determining that overall unit shape or unit layout type might not be a good predictor of nurses' walking behavior; instead the characteristics of the path that connects functional spaces such as patient room and medication area might better predict nurses' walking behavior.

This visual tool facilitates matching spatial flow with caregivers' workflow to reduce waste and redundancies, as recommended by Lean thinking. Providing work environments that protect caregivers from fatigue, interruptions, and redundancies can contribute to quality patient care. By studying the Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities and reviewing the literature, the authors identified the main clinical spaces supporting nursing care and their important linkages. Space syntax, a diagrammatic analysis of relationships, was used to decode spatial relationships among the clinical spaces in five case studies. The movement distributions were measured and possible conflicts with focus-demanding tasks, such as noise and interruptions, were identified. The information was summarized in a visual diagram providing the \"syntactic anatomy\" of the most important work spaces. The main clinical spaces were the following: (1) patient corridor; (2) nurses' station; (3) medication area; (4) clean room; (5) soiled room; (6) physicians' dictation area; (7) report room; (8) restricted nourishment area; (9) equipment storage; and (10) unrestricted nourishment area. The report room, nourishment area, and physician workspace showed strong linkages to the patient corridor and nurses' station, although such spaces were not clearly discussed in the design guidelines. The most caregiver movement occurs in the patient corridor and nurses' station. These areas pose the greatest possibility of interruptions by persons. The results were translated into a visual design efficiency checklist. Illustrating the spatial order of the support spaces-and comparing that to use patterns-enables designers to reduce the movement sequences nurses undertake when accessing resources and identify where the flow is disrupted by \"displaced\" functions.

Relatively little research has examined the role of the physical design of nursing units on communication patterns among care providers.

Using a pre\/post research design comparing more centralized or decentralized unit designs with a new multi-hub design, the aim of this study was to describe the relationship between the clinical spatial environment and its effect on communication patterns, nurse satisfaction, distance walked, organizational outcomes, patient safety, and patient satisfaction. Hospital institutional data indicated that patient satisfaction increased substantially.

Most staff members (89%) perceived the renovation period as louder, and 83% reported interruptions of their work. Patient outcomes were the same or more positive during construction. Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants were less likely to require 24+ hours' mechanical ventilation during construction: 54% vs. 59% before (OR = 1.6, p = 0.018) and 62% after (OR = 1.48, p = 0.065); and they required a shorter total period of mechanical ventilation: 3.6 days vs. 8.0 before (p = 0.011) and 9.5 after (p = 0.001). VLBW newborns' differences in ventilation days were mostly in the upper extremes; medians were similar in all periods: 0.6 days vs. 1 day preconstruction and 2 days postconstruction. Construction above the NICU did not cause substantially louder sound levels, but staff perceived important changes in noise and work routines.

In recent years there has been an increase in the design and construction of single-family rooms (SFRs) because they provide more privacy for families, offer better control over environmental stimuli such as lighting and noise, and possibly reduce infections. On the other hand, this model can cause staff members to feel isolated from one another, reduce their ability to respond quickly in a crisis situation, or impose additional demands on them. Few studies document the advantages and disadvantages of the SFR NICU model. This study utilized pre- and post-move surveys to investigate staff perceptions of the NICU. Overall, staff members perceive the quality of the work environment, and the safety and quality of the environment provided to patients and their families, as better in the renovated, combination NICU design (SFR and open bay) when compared to the open-bay, pre-move design.

However, an understanding of the underlying perceptual mechanisms has been lacking. In this article, neuroscience studies that use visual images to induce fear, anxiety, or pain are reviewed to gain an understanding of how the brain processes visual images in this context and to explore whether this processing can be linked to specific visual characteristics. The amygdala was identified as one of the key regions of the brain involved in the processing of fear, anxiety, and pain (induced by visual images). Other key areas included the thalamus, insula, and hippocampus. Characteristics of visual images such as the emotional dimension (valence\/arousal), subject matter (familiarity, ambiguity, novelty, realism, and facial expressions), and form (sharp and curved contours) were identified as key factors influencing emotional processing. The broad structural properties of an image and overall content were found to have a more pivotal role in the emotional response than the specific details of an image.

Sound measurements indicated a significant reduction in the unoccupied SFR to less than half of the levels in the OPBY NICU. However, respiratory support equipment generated levels well above those of the ambient environment. Illumination was significantly reduced in the SFR. Ambient illumination in nursing work areas was less than recommended. In other comparisons with the OPBY NICU the SFR NICU was shown to have: a shorter interval until full enteric feedings were established; improved parent satisfaction; improved staff perceptions of the environment and care; a decrease in nurses State-Trait Anxiety scores; an increased need for total numbers of staff and nursing staff per shift; increased walking per shift by nurses and nurse practitioners; and improved sleep time in a very small sample of patients. Analysis of the cost of construction showed comparable cost per ft(2); however, the cost per bed in the SFR NICU was much greater because of the increased area of this facility. Highly notable findings of this investigation included the same incidence of adverse outcomes of care and a reduction in the adjusted direct cost of care in the SFR NICU.

Comparing light levels independent of ICU assignment supported the hypothesis that increased light levels reduce pain perception and length of stay, but the relationship was not statistically significant. One trend, not statistically significant, suggested that view was associated with reduced pain perception. A decrease in incident filings supported the hypothesis that improved natural light and views reduced errors, but results were not statistically significant.

The study had a methodological and developmental design based on an established methodology for instrument development and validation. The development process consisted of three main phases: (1) item generation and scale construction; (2) assessment of face and content validity, and (3) testing of the reliability. To obtain face and content validity, expert panels reviewed the COB-I. Content validity was assessed using the Content Validity Index (I - CVI = item level, S - CVI = scale level). Reliability was tested by test-retest and inter-rater reliability. CQB-I was found to have good content validity (I - CVI = 0.78 - 1.0 and S - CVI = 0.98). Inter-rater reliability was acceptable (Spearman's correlation = 0.62) and stability was considered high for both raters (83% and 88%, respectively).

This model facilitated the effective implementation of = Lean principles and a joint governance model combining stakeholders under a shared vision. The healthcare facility discussed is a California healthcare district in San Diego. Because of state seismic safety legislation, the district elected to build a replacement hospital for its tertiary care trauma facility. The organization's leadership decided to pursue a course that demanded innovation in both the design and construction process. The owner, architects, construction manager, and trade contractors adopted a high-performance team model to meet this challenge. The governance and leadership of a construction project should reflect the design and ultimate intent of the facility. The vision of building the most innovative hospital under constrained resources required the implementation of an innovative approach to leading the construction process. ","681":"The aim of this pilot study was to test design interventions such as lighting, color, and spatial color patterning on nurses' stress, alertness, and satisfaction, and to provide an example of how clinical simulation centers can be used to conduct research. The application of evidence-based design research in healthcare settings requires a transdisciplinary approach. Integrating approaches from multiple fields in real-life settings often proves time consuming and experimentally difficult. However, forums for collaboration such as clinical simulation centers may offer a solution. In these settings, identical operating and patient rooms are used to deliver simulated patient care scenarios using automated mannequins. Two identical rooms were modified in the clinical simulation center. Nurses spent 30 minutes in each room performing simulated cardiac resuscitation. Subjective measures of nurses' stress, alertness, and satisfaction were collected and compared between settings and across time using matched-pair t-test analysis. Nurses reported feeling less stressed after exposure to the experimental room than nurses who were exposed to the control room (2.22, p = .03). Scores post-session indicated a significant reduction in stress and an increase in alertness after exposure to the experimental room as compared to the control room, with significance levels below .10. (Change in stress scores: 3.44, p = .069); (change in alertness scores: 3.6, p = .071). This study reinforces the use of validated survey tools to measure stress, alertness, and satisfaction. Results support human-centered design approaches by evaluating the effect on nurses in an experimental setting. ","682":"There has been an uptick in the field of emergency department (ED) operations research and data gathering, both published and unpublished. This new information has implications for ED design. The specialty suffers from an inability to have these innovations reach frontline practitioners, let alone design professionals and architects. This paper is an attempt to synthesize for design professionals the growing data regarding ED operations. The following sources were used to capture and summarize the research and data collections available regarding ED operations: the Emergency Department Benchmarking Alliance database; a literature search using both PubMed and Google Scholar search engines; and data presented at conferences and proceedings. Critical information that affects ED design strategies is summarized, organized, and presented. Data suggest an optimal size for ED functional units. The now-recognized arrival and census curves for the ED suggest a department that expands and contracts in response to changing census. Operational improvements have been dearly identified and are grouped into three categories: input, throughput, and outflow. Applications of this information are suggested. The sentinel premise of this meta-synthesis is that data derived from improvement work in the area of ED operations has applications for ED design. EDs can optimize their functioning by marrying good processes and operations to good design. This review paper is an attempt to bring this new information to the attention of the multidisciplinary team of architects, designers, and clinicians. ","683":"","684":"Hospital construction is a significant event in any health system. The financial implications are great, especially at a time of shrinking capital resources. Personnel are affected, as are the processes to perform their tasks. Often, new facilities are catalysts that change organizational culture; it has been clearly shown that new facilities have a positive impact on patient satisfaction scores. The members of the C-suite of a hospital\/health system play important roles in construction projects. However, no one is more critical to the success of such major endeavors than the chief executive officer (CEO). The CEO sets the tone for the project, giving direction to the design and construction process that may have implications for the rest of the organization. Palomar Pomerado Health (PPH) is the largest public health district in California. In 2002, the PPH governing board authorized the creation of a new facility master plan for the district, which included the construction of a replacement facility for its tertiary care trauma center. The new Palomar Medical Center is slated to open in August 2012. HERD had the opportunity to speak with PPH CEO Michael H. Covert on the role of the CEO in the building of this \"fable hospital\".","685":"In 2003, Princeton HealthCare System (PHCS) completed a strategic plan that called for replacing its 220-bed acute care hospital--a decision driven by the need to serve a growing and aging population and the demand for new programs, services, technologies, and clinical strategies. As hospitals nationwide undertake similar projects to replace aging facilities, they face many of the same challenges. Various factors must be considered when designing a new hospital. Two significant obstacles to great design exist: First, hospital executives understand the economic and clinical drivers that affect hospital care and financial performance but often lack an appreciation for how design decisions can impact these critical factors. Second, CEOs often delegate oversight to others in the organization. The CEO's direct participation is necessary to ensure that the project reflects the organization's values and strategic and operational objectives. Solutions to address this dilemma include increased use of evidence-based design and strategies such as tying payment for design services to long-term facility performance indicators. Effective partnerships among healthcare planners, facility designers, and hospital executives will result in a new facility whose design promotes improved clinical outcomes, greater patient satisfaction, and financial viability.","686":"","687":"","688":"","689":"","690":"Hospitals clean environmental surfaces to lower microbial contamination and reduce the likelihood of transmitting infections. Despite current cleaning and hand hygiene protocols, hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) continue to result in a significant loss of life and cost the U.S. healthcare system an estimated $45 billion annually. Stainless steel and chrome are often selected for hospital touch surfaces for their \"clean appearance,\" comparatively smooth finish, resistance to standard cleaners, and relative effectiveness for removing visible dirt during normal cleaning. Designers use wood surfaces for aesthetics; plastic surfaces have become increasingly endemic for their relative lower initial cost; and \"antimicrobial agents\" are being incorporated into a variety of surface finishes.This paper concentrates on environmental surface materials with a history of bactericidal control of infectious agents and focuses on the methods necessary to validate their effectiveness in healthcare situations. Research shows copper-based metals to have innate abilities to kill bacteria in laboratory settings, but their effectiveness in patient care environments has not been adequately investigated. This article presents a research methodology to expand the evidence base from the laboratory to the built environment. For such research to have a meaningful impact on the design\/specifying community, it should assess typical levels of environmental pathogens (i.e., surface \"cleanliness\") as measured by microbial burden (MB); evaluate the extent to which an intervention with copper-based materials in a randomized clinical trial affects the level of contamination; and correlate how the levels of MB affect the incidence of infections acquired during hospital stays.","691":"To substantiate the anticipated benefits of the original acuity-adaptable care delivery model as defined by innovator Ann Hendrich. In today's conveyor belt approach to healthcare, upon admission and through discharge, patients are commonly transferred based on changing acuity needs. Wasted time and money and inefficiencies in hospital operations often result-in addition to jeopardizing patient safety. In the last decade, a handful of hospitals pioneered the implementation of the acuity-adaptable care delivery model. Built on the concept of eliminating patient transfers, the projected outcomes of acuity-adaptable units-decreased average lengths of stay, increased patient safety and satisfaction, and increased nurses' satisfaction from reduced walking distances-make a good case for a model patient room. Although some hospitals experienced the projected benefits of the acuity-adaptable care delivery model, sustaining the outcomes proved to be difficult; hence, the original definition of acuity-adaptable units has not fared well. Variations on the original concept demonstrate that eliminating patient transfers has not been completely abandoned in healthcare redesign and construction initiatives. Terms such as flex-up, flex-down, universal room, and single-stay unit have since emerged. These variations convolute the search for empirical evidence to support the anticipated benefits of the original concept. To determine the future of this concept and its variants, a significant amount of outcome data must be generated by piloting the concept in different hospital settings. As further refinements and adjustments to the concept emerge, the acuity-adaptable room may find a place in future hospitals. ","692":"","693":"Continuous monitoring of patients throughout the hospital is a desirable method to ensure the continuity of quality care. Hospitals looking to improve the manner in which they maintain such continuity without compromising efficiency must explore the benefits of implementing monitoring technology to its fullest potential. This case study chronicles the journey of a level-one trauma hospital during the expansion of remote wireless telemetry monitoring and the telemetry technician role. The lives saved as a result of this expansion were primarily attributable to the installation of remote wireless telemetry monitoring in the emergency department. The expansion of the telemetry technician role improved not only the quality of the monitoring signal and recognition, but also the ability to identify changes in trended data. The next step for improving care delivery includes the addition of a patient locator system within the facility, which will provide the most accurate information regarding patient location during transfer. Accurately identifying patient location in addition to alerting staff to changes in patient status will ensure that care providers respond promptly and that the highest quality of patient care is delivered while patients are away from the nursing unit.","694":"This study determined whether a private room or open ward design better met optimal environmental conditions for a neonatal intensive care unit with regard to sound level, light level, temperature and humidity. Multiple-bed designs for hospital neonatal intensive care units were the standard until recently. Now, private room designs promise to provide better conditions for neonate development and patient care quality. The study compared an eight-bed open ward design with a private room design of a 45-bed neonatal intensive care unit, measuring the environmental parameters of sound, light, temperature, and humidity before and after the construction and occupation of a new private room unit. Average light levels were higher in the private room design because of the increased number of windows, but both designs were within the recommended levels. Mean temperature readings were two degrees cooler in the private room environment, and readings were more stable. Mean humidity readings in the two environments were the same, but humidity levels in the private room design were more stable. Median sound level in the private room design was lower than the open ward design, but the range was similar. The private room design allows for a more controlled patient care environment that can be maintained within a smaller range of variation nearer optimal environmental conditions. ","695":"This paper presents a study to gain insight into the effects of the visibility of medical equipment on the well-being of patients. Encounters with healthcare situations are characterized by stress and anxiety. The presence of wires, tubes, and monitors near the bedside may contribute to these feelings. One of the trends in healthcare design is to organize the headwalls of patient rooms in such a way as to reduce clutter and minimize the visibility of medical equipment, but no experimental studies are available that investigate the effects of the visibility of medical equipment in patient rooms. This experiment employed a single-factor between-subjects design (medical equipment visible vs. medical equipment out of sight) exposing participants (n = 42) to a scenario and a picture of a hospital room. Placing medical equipment out of sight leads to reduced feelings of stress in patients. This stress-reducing effect is mediated by feelings of pleasure. Placing medical equipment out of sight leads to a more positive emotional state, which in turn leads to feelings of reduced stress in patients. Moreover, placing equipment out of sight leads to people having more trust in the healthcare provider. The current study emphasizes the importance of the built healthcare environment and shows what role the visibility of medical equipment can play in the healing process of patients.

Few studies have focused on how the physical environment might contribute to nurses' WRS and chronic nursing shortages. The construct of EC can be used, within a Person Environment (PE)-Fit framework, to assess the fit among nurses, nursing work, the physical work environment, and WRS. EC was measured using investigator-developed, literature\/criterion-based survey instruments. Staff RNs reported WRS variables by using two single-item self-report measures. The final convenience sample consisted of 471 staff RNs from 39 medical\/surgical units from 12 hospitals in the upper Midwest. Data were collected over a 7-month period. The mean level of existing EC in the sample was roughly 70% percent of highest capacity and that of important\/desired EC in the sample was 93%. Staff RNs' mean level of WRS was 6.7; the mean contribution of the physical environment to WRS was 5.8. Moderate negative correlations were found between EC and WRS (r = -.41, p &lt; .05), and between physical environment contribution to WRS and EC (r = -.55, p &lt;.001). Staff RNs in the sampled units wanted a significantly higher level of EC. They rated their WRS moderately high and the contribution of the physical environment to it as moderate. A moderately negative relationship was found between EC and WRS. EC may be a useful construct in research that attempts to improve hospital nursing work environments. ","697":"The purpose of this investigation was to identify safety and efficiency-related design features for inclusion in operating room (OR) construction documents. Organizations are confronted with an array of challenges when planning an OR, including inefficiencies in operations, adverse events, and a variety of innovations to choose from. Currently, techniques that can be used in design practice and to inform design decision making for implementable OR solutions are limited. The project team used a structured focus group format with mixed methods to solicit 19 varying surgical team members' reactions to a three-dimensional video mock-up of a proposed OR. Data from the 19 participants were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression and content analysis of open-ended responses. Results demonstrate that several features of the proposed OR design predict meaningful outcomes, including flexibility and satisfaction with the OR setup, adverse event prevention, team performance, and distractions and interruptions. Participants' suggested solutions include universal booms to support anesthetic and perfusion capabilities, a fixed circulating nursing workstation that faces the patient and is at the foot of the operating room table, a wall-mounted monitor across from the surgeon, and wiring to support a touch-screen control arm in OR surgical fields. Findings from structured focus groups with mixed methods lead to implementable design solutions for construction documentation.

In the worst cases, the facility is demolished, incapable of accommodating cycles of change. These are well known but poorly documented realities. Today, it is not unusual for one architect to design a hospital and another to design the interior fit-out, either initially or years later. Some clients ask for \"shell space\" to be fitted out later by another firm. Architects educated to define function first and to maintain unified control find this unsettling, believing that only if one party controls everything can high-quality architecture result. This is not the case, as diverse buildings, cities, and neighborhoods show, but the belief dies hard. In fact, the educational paradigm in schools of architecture largely maintains the old myths.This article describes this reality and poses questions about habit and method that are now at odds with reality.

For the past 20 years, an intervention that has gained increasing attention has been the physical design of healthcare facilities-hospitals in particular. EBD has been advocated as one means of using research to examine the relationship between design and healthcare to improve patient safety and the quality of care.

Many health buildings become obsolete before the end of their effective physical lives, requiring extensive reconfiguration or replacement. This study sought to move beyond the oft-used buzzword flexibility to seek effective strategies to accommodate future change (future-proofing) that could be further explored in Australia and other developed countries. A systematic literature review compiled definitions of flexibility and adaptability from a range of sources. Nineteen case studies were identified that illustrated various future-proofing strategies. A matrix was developed to classify different approaches to flexibility and then used to assess the case studies. Analysis was hampered by inconsistent use of terminology and limited availability of quantifiable methods for assessing the long-term success of approaches to future-proofing. Several key strategies were identified, classified, and discussed in terms of their relevance and application. More rigorous definitions of flexibility, adaptability, and related terms are needed to enable more useful comparisons of the strategies implemented to future-proof health projects. Local conditions often affect both the strategies adopted and the degree to which they can be considered successful. Many of the case studies analyzed in this research were not operational long enough to enable assessment of their claims of being future-proofed. Therefore, review of lifetime facility costs, including the service life periods of major facility components, should be considered, and some older projects should be evaluated in terms of these criteria.

A case study and description of the methodology with which surrogate measures of chart-related patient safety were studied and subsequently used to reduce latent hazards are presented. Medical records present a challenge to patient safety in EDs. Application of HFE can improve specific aspects of existing medical chart organization systems as they pertain to patient safety in acute care environments. During 10 random audits over 5 consecutive days (573 data points), 56 (9.8%) chart binders (range 0.0-23%) were found to be either misplaced or improperly positioned relative to other chart binders; 12 (21%) were in the critical care area. HFE principles were applied to develop an experimental chart binder system with alternating color-based chart groupings, simple and prominent identifiers, and embedded visual cues.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) preceded (and inspired) the development of evidence-based design (EBD) for healthcare facilities. A key feature of debate around EBM has been the question of interpretation of the guidance by experienced clinicians, to achieve maximum efficacy for individual patients. This interpretation and translation of guidelines-avoiding a formulaic approach, allowing for divergent cultural and geographical exigencies, creating innovative, context-specific solutions-is the subject of this discussion, which examines the potential for integration of evidence-based and experience-based approaches in the development of creative solutions to healthcare services in England. This paper examines Practice-Based Commissioning (PBC) in England, which devolves responsibility for commissioning new services for patients to frontline clinicians, relying on their understanding of patient needs at the local level. An 18-month project, funded by the Health and Care Infrastructure Research and Innovation Centre (HaCIRIC), examined PBC frameworks in England, investigating the impact of different models of governance on the development of service redesign proposals to answer the following questions: How do clinicians interpret the multiplicity of guidance from government agencies and translate this into knowledge that can be effectively used to redesign patient care pathways aligned with local healthcare priorities?

People spend a considerable proportion of time waiting in hospitals. Studies show that the quality of waiting environments influences the perception of quality of care and caregivers, that perception of waiting time is a better indicator of patient satisfaction than actual waiting time, and that the waiting environment contributes to the perception of wait time. In fact, the attractiveness of the physical environment in waiting areas has been shown to be significantly associated with higher perceived quality of care, less anxiety, and higher reported positive interaction with staff. Can positive distractions in waiting areas improve the waiting experience, as indicated by the behavior and activities of children waiting for treatment? Five distraction conditions were randomly introduced in the waiting area of the dental and cardiac clinics of a major pediatric tertiary care center through a single plasma screen intervention. The attention, behavior, and activities of waiting children were recorded. Data on 158 pediatric patients were collected over 12 days during December 2008 and January 2009. Data analysis shows that the introduction of distraction conditions was associated with more calm behavior and less fine and gross movement, suggesting significant calming effects associated with the distraction conditions. Data also suggest that positive distraction conditions are significant attention grabbers and could be an important contributor to improving the waiting experience for children in hospitals by improving environmental attractiveness.

This investigation was a prospective cohort study comparing satisfaction survey results for parents who responded to a commercially available parent NICU satisfaction survey following the provision of NICU care in open-bay and single-family room facilities. A subset of 16 items indicative of family-centered care was also computed and compared for these two NICU facilities. Parents whose babies received care in the single-family room facility expressed significantly improved survey responses in regard to the NICU environment, overall assessment of care, and total survey score than did parents of neonates in the open-bay facility. With the exception of the section on nursing in which scores in both facilities were high, nonsignificant improvement in median scores for the sections on delivery, physicians, discharge planning, and personal issues were noted. The total median item score for family-centered care was significantly greater in the single-family room than the open-bay facility. Parental satisfaction with care in the single-family room NICU was improved in comparison with the traditional open-bay NICU.

Although numerous studies evoke overwhelming support for lactation initiation in hospitals, few designers may understand the importance of such spaces. Furthermore, many designers may be unaware of the contributions they may make to this initiative. Countless studies that support the philosophy that breast milk is the best nutritional option for babies have been conducted. There are many health and economic advantages of breastfeeding for babies, mothers, and communities. Research suggests that exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life reduces the rate of illness throughout infancy and beyond, saves lives, and could save billions of dollars in the United States each year.The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative is a global program established to promote within healthcare facilities the facilitation of breastfeeding infants from birth. Results of this initiative show a significant increase in breastfeeding rates in many countries. The intuitive design response to such favorable research is to enhance the lactation environment, assuming that mothers who feel comfortable in lactation spaces will use them more frequently, which promotes lactation in healthcare facilities. Considering the numerous research-supported advantages of breastfeeding, designers would be prudent to seek and apply knowledge of the environmental needs to the design of lactation spaces. This may be achieved by becoming familiar with lactation procedures to understand the circulation, adjacencies, and spatial requirements of lactation programs.

Yet other important design considerations, such as caregiver interaction, discomfort at bedside, and harmful materials, often are overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to consider the effects of existing incubator designs and to suggest criteria for the next generation of infant incubators. Incubators of the mid-1940s established an industry standard that exists to this day: portholes in an infant chamber positioned over a mechanical system, resting on top of storage cabinets or drawers. This design is unresponsive to many of the infants' needs and significantly influences parent\/infant interaction. The physical effects and social barriers that the incubator presents to the health and well-being of infants are compounded by the use of unhealthful substances and materials such as formaldehyde. Collectively, these conditions call for an incubator that not only ameliorates physical and social obstacles, but also uses benign materials. Simple alterations to existing incubator design, such as introducing color and pattern, providing arm rests, and freeing space beneath the infant chamber to accommodate seated caregivers, would encourage more prolonged periods of contact with the infant occupants, thereby improving their behavioral organization and recovery. Replacing harmful materials with alternatives such as formaldehyde-free substrates in the cabinetry also will improve the developmental outcomes of the infant occupants. These types of recommended changes embrace the intent of the incubator to provide a controlled, secure environment while acknowledging that incubators are not merely medical equipment, but the living spaces of their infant occupants.

Following the addition of wireless communication, response time to patient calls and the number of nurse-initiated communications were compared to pre-wireless calls and response time sampling period. In the baseline study, nurse-initiated communications and response time to patient calls were investigated for a team nursing model (Guarascio-Howard &amp; Malloch, 2007). At this time, technology consisted of a nurse call system and telephones located at each decentralized nurse station and health unit coordinator (HUC) station. For this follow-up study, a wireless device was given to nurses and their team members following training on device use and privacy issues. Four registered nurses (RNs) were shadowed for 8 hours (32 hours total) before and after the introduction of the wireless devices. Data were collected regarding patient room visits, number of patient calls, bed status calls, response time to calls, and the initiator of the communication episodes. Follow-up study response time to calls significantly decreased (t-test p = .03). RNs and licensed practical nurses responded to bed status calls in less than 1 minute-62% of the 37 calls. Communication results indicated a significant shift (One Proportion Z Test) in RN-initiated communications, suggesting an enhanced ability to communicate with team members and to assist in monitoring patient status. Patient falls trended downward, although not significantly (p &gt; .05), for a 6-month period of wireless technology use compared to the same period the previous year. The addition of a wireless device has advantages in team nursing, namely increasing communication with staff members and decreasing response time to patient and bed status calls.

Study 1 allowed for the development of a structured inventory of nightstand use today in assisted living and rehabilitation facilities. Study 1 led to Study 2, demonstrating the need to conceptualize new ideas for smart nightstands. Feedback was obtained from intergenerational participants who could discuss their needs and preferences for a smart nightstand. In Study 1, more than 150 items were recorded and categorized into 25 different groups. The authors found that participants utilized the top portion of their nightstand as opposed to the lower sections; most items were found on top of the nightstand or in the top drawer.

The results were to be summarized and substantiated through an interdisciplinary interpretation, taking into account changes in the orientation process of people with dementia. Spatial disorientation and declining wayfinding abilities are among the early symptoms of dementia, limiting a person's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) independently and ultimately, perhaps leading to institutionalization. A prerequisite to maintaining residents' quality of life in a nursing home is their ability to orient themselves within their new environment. The available literature on wayfinding design for people with dementia in nursing homes was reviewed. Two aspects of interventions for residents' wayfinding abilities were identified: the design of the floor plan typology and environmental cues. The design of the physical environment plays a major role in supporting the wayfinding abilities of people with dementia. The floor plan design of a nursing home in particular has a significant influence on residents' spatial orientation and wayfinding. Additional interventions such as signage, furnishing, lighting, and colors are additional supporting features but they cannot compensate for an adverse architectural design. For the creation of a supportive, dementia-friendly environment, both aspects of architectural design must be considered.

Reactions to density and proximity are complex. Greater density intensifies people's reaction to a situation in the direction (positive or negative) that they would react if the situation were to occur under less dense conditions. People with dementia are especially reactive to the environment. Using a cross-sectional correlational design in nursing homes and assisted living facilities involving 185 participants, multiple observations (N = 6,455) of crowding and other environmental variables were made. Crowding, location, and sound were measured three times per observation; ambiance was measured once. Data analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance. Crowding estimates were higher for nursing homes and in dining and activity rooms. Crowding also varied across settings and locations by time of day. Overall, the interaction of location and time affected crowding significantly (N = 5,559, df [47, 511], F = 105.69, p &lt; .0001); effects were greater within location-by-hour than between location-by-hour, but the effect explained slightly less variance in Long-Term Care Crowding Index (LTC-CI) estimates (47.41%) than location alone. Crowding had small, direct, and highly significant correlations with sound and with the engaging subscale for ambiance; a similar, though inverse, correlation was seen with the soothing subscale for ambiance. Crowding fluctuates consistent with routine activities such as meals in long-term care settings. Furthermore, a relationship between crowding and other physical characteristics of the environment was found. The LTC-CI is likely to be more sensitive than simple people counts when seeking to evaluate the effects of crowding on the behavior of elders-particularly those with dementia-in long-term care settings. aging in place. ","729":"To pilot test the Birth Unit Design Spatial Evaluation Tool (BUDSET) in an Australian maternity care setting to determine whether such an instrument can measure the optimality of different birth settings. Optimally designed spaces to give birth are likely to influence a woman's ability to experience physiologically normal labor and birth. This is important in the current industrialized environment, where increased caesarean section rates are causing concerns. The measurement of an optimal birth space is currently impossible, because there are limited tools available. A quantitative study was undertaken to pilot test the discriminant ability of the BUDSET in eight maternity units in New South Wales, Australia. Five auditors trained in the use of the BUDSET assessed the birth units using the BUDSET, which is based on 18 design principles and is divided into four domains (Fear Cascade, Facility, Aesthetics, and Support) with three to eight assessable items in each. Data were independently collected in eight birth units. Values for each of the domains were aggregated to provide an overall Optimality Score for each birth unit. A range of Optimality Scores was derived for each of the birth units (from 51 to 77 out of a possible 100 points). The BUDSET identified units with low-scoring domains. Essentially these were older units and conventional labor ward settings. The BUDSET provides a way to assess the optimality of birth units and determine which domain areas may need improvement. There is potential for improvements to existing birth spaces, and considerable improvement can be made with simple low-cost modifications. Further research is needed to validate the tool. ","730":"To determine differences in the rate of falls, healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs), and the degree of social isolation in hospitalized older adults admitted to private versus semi-private rooms. The American Institute of Architects recommends that private rooms become the industry standard for all new construction of acute care hospitals. Healthcare design researchers contend that private rooms decrease infection, facilitate healthcare workers' efficiency, provide space for families, and afford greater access to privacy. Although links between room type and health outcomes have been described in the literature, the actual relationship between these two variables has not been determined, nor is it clear whether a one-size-fits-all approach to hospital design is appropriate for all patient populations, particularly older adults. This retrospective case comparative design utilized a sample of patients admitted to the University Medical Center of Princeton in 2006 and received full internal review board approval. Patient records were randomly selected through the admission\/discharge\/transfer system of the hospital and then divided into two groups based on room type. Data collected included demographics, incidence of falls, HAIs, and risk of social isolation. All patients were more than 65 years old and had been admitted to the hospital for a variety of diagnoses. Length of stay was between 3 and 10 days. There was no significant difference between the type of room and the likelihood of falling (p = .37), however the relative risk of falling in a private room was 4.01. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of HAIs based on room type (p = 1.0). The risk-of-social-isolation variable was unable to significantly affect which hospitalized older adults would suffer a negative outcome, fall, or HAI (p = .52). Room type may play a role in the occurrence of falls in hospitalized older adults, but room type alone does not increase the chance of acquiring an infection in the hospital. Nor does the risk of social isolation affect the likelihood of an adverse outcome.

Not only are new healthcare-related services being provided to the community, but also there is increasing concern for providing services to extend the life cycle of built facilities. This trend is similar to what has been observed in manufacturing, where different approaches are used to combine products and services, generating high-value integrated solutions.This article analyzes integrated-solution approaches that have been adopted in the manufacturing sector and compares them to trends that are emerging in the healthcare sector. The practical implications of these trends in the UK healthcare sector are also pointed out. This study discusses how to improve value generation by combining products and services; it also addresses the need for a value-creating system that is capable of developing and sustaining new healthcare infrastructures.Some of the major changes needed to achieve fully integrated solutions in healthcare-such as supporting policies for innovation and stakeholder engagement-are pointed out. However, understanding the theoretical concept behind such approaches (and thus how value can be generated) and the challenges associated with introducing them into practice seem to be the first steps toward achieving integrated solutions in the healthcare context.","741":"Using the environment as a strategic tool is one of the most cost-effective and enduring approaches for improving public health; however, it is one that requires multiple perspectives. The purpose of this article is to highlight an innovative methodology that has been developed for conducting comprehensive performance evaluations in public sector health facilities in Canada. The building performance evaluation methodology described in this paper is a government initiative. The project team developed a comprehensive building evaluation process for all new capital health projects that would respond to the aforementioned need for stakeholders to be more accountable and to better integrate the larger organizational strategy of facilities. The Balanced Scorecard, which is a multiparadigmatic, performance-based business framework, serves as the underlying theoretical framework for this initiative. It was applied in the development of the conceptual model entitled the Building Performance Evaluation Scorecard, which provides the following benefits: (1) It illustrates a process to link facilities more effectively to the overall mission and goals of an organization; (2) It is both a measurement and a management system that has the ability to link regional facilities to measures of success and larger business goals; (3) It provides a standardized methodology that ensures consistency in assessing building performance; and (4) It is more comprehensive than traditional building evaluations. The methodology presented in this paper is both a measurement and management system that integrates the principles of evidence-based design with the practices of pre- and post-occupancy evaluation. It promotes accountability and continues throughout the life cycle of a project. The advantage of applying this framework is that it engages health organizations in clarifying a vision and strategy for their facilities and helps translate those strategies into action and measurable performance outcomes. ","742":"","743":"The purpose of this study was to develop quantitative measures of the structure of visual fields in nursing units. The structure of visual fields in nursing units-especially visibility toward patient beds-is believed to have a direct influence on the routine use of space by medical staff and patient outcomes within units. Although previous studies are suggestive, none has developed rigorous measures of the visibility within nursing units. To compare the degree of visibility toward patient beds among different nursing units, the targeted visibility index (TVI) was introduced. The TVI measures the degree to which an observer can see all targets in a nursing unit. It provided a comparative spatial quality evaluation of various nursing unit configurations with differing numbers of patient beds. It was developed and programmed on the ArcGIS version 9.2 platform (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA) with component object model-based ArcObjects and Visual Basic for Application language (Microsoft). The assessment of three nursing unit designs by TVI aligned exactly with empirical evaluations conducted in previous studies. This study provided an opportunity and supplied relevant measures for healthcare facility designers to specify the visual structures of important behavioral effects. It is anticipated that the TVI will contribute to the understanding of healthcare design and the resulting outcomes. ","744":"This paper analyzes the dynamics relating to flexibility in a hospital project context. Three research questions are addressed: (1) When is flexibility used in the life cycle of a project? (2) What are the stakeholders' perspectives on project flexibility? And (3) What is the nature of the interaction between flexibility in the process of a project and flexibility in terms of the characteristics of a building? Flexibility is discussed from both a project management point of view and from a hospital architecture perspective. Flexibility in project life cycle and from a stakeholder perspective is examined, and the interaction between flexibility in scope lock-in and building flexibility is investigated. The results are based on case studies of four Norwegian hospital projects. Information relating to the projects has been obtained from evaluation reports, other relevant documents, and interviews. Observations were codified and analyzed based on selected parameters that represent different aspects of flexibility. One of the cases illustrates how late changes can have a significant negative impact on the project itself, contributing to delays and cost overruns. Another case illustrates that late scope lock-in on a limited part of the project, in this case related to medical equipment, can be done in a controlled manner. Project owners and users appear to have given flexibility high priority. Project management teams are less likely to embrace changes and late scope lock-in. Architects and consultants are important for translating program requirements into physical design. A highly flexible building did not stop some stakeholders from pushing for significant changes and extensions during construction.

The theoretical background for a Lean asset approach and a high-level analysis of data from hospital trusts in England have been published elsewhere. This paper reports on the first uses of that approach in operational settings. Observations are drawn primarily from three case studies. The individual studies support the premise that the conventional emphasis on cost per square meter (m(2)) as a preeminent measure of FM disguises a portfolio of too much underutilized space. They provide a means of putting a healthcare estates strategy in terms that will engage business users.

This article outlines a framework for a performance-based measurement tool that can provide the necessary decision support during the design or evaluation of a healthcare environment by estimating the overall design performance of multiple variables. New knowledge in EBD adds continuously to complexity (the \"information explosion\"), and it becomes impossible to consider all aspects (design features) at the same time, much less their impact on final building performance. How can existing knowledge and the information explosion in healthcare-specifically the domain of EBD-be rendered manageable? Is it feasible to create a computational model that considers many design features and deals with them in an integrated way, rather than one at a time? The found evidence is structured and readied for computation through a \"fuzzification\" process. The weights are calculated using an analytical hierarchy process. Actual knowledge modeling is accomplished through a fuzzy neural tree structure. The impact of all inputs on the outcome-in this case, patient recovery-is calculated using sensitivity analysis. Finally, the added value of the model is discussed using a hypothetical case study of a patient room. The proposed model can deal with the complexities of various aspects and the relationships among variables in a coordinated way, allowing existing and new pieces of evidence to be integrated in a knowledge tree structure that facilitates understanding of the effects of various design interventions on overall design performance. ","749":"Although the importance of the environment in relation to healing processes has been well established, empirical evidence for environmental effects on patient well-being and behavior is sparse. In addition, few attempts have been made to integrate insights from related fields of research such as retailing and services marketing with findings from healthcare studies. In this paper, relevant findings and insights from these domains are discussed. What insights and findings from retailing and services marketing are (potentially) of interest to the healthcare context, and how should one interpret and follow up on these results in healthcare environments? Research in retailing and services marketing indicates that physical environmental factors (i.e., music and scent) and social environmental factors (i.e., crowded conditions) may affect consumer satisfaction and well-being. In addition, environmental effects have been shown to vary with contextual factors (e.g., the type of environment) and consumer needs (e.g., the extent to which consumers value social contact or stimulation in a specific setting). Although the evidence base for environmental factors in health environments is steadily growing, few attempts have been made to integrate findings from both domains. The findings presented indicate that environmental variables such as music and scent can contribute to patient well-being and overall satisfaction. In addition, findings suggest that these variables may be used to counteract the negative effects resulting from crowded conditions in different healthcare units. Taking into account recent developments in the healthcare industry, the importance of creating memorable and pleasant patient experiences is likely to grow in the years to come. Hence, the finding that subtle and relatively inexpensive manipulations may affect patient well-being in profound ways should inspire follow-up research aimed at unraveling the specifics of environmental influences in health environments. ","750":"This article explores lessons to be learned from three different healthcare systems and the possible implications for the management of healthcare real estate, in particular in connection to the Dutch system. It discusses similarities and differences among the different systems, in search of possible consequences on cost, financing, and design innovation. To keep healthcare affordable in the future, the Dutch government is currently in the process of changing legislation to move from a centrally directed system to a so-called regulated market system. The deregulation of real estate investment that accompanies the new healthcare delivery system offers healthcare organizations new opportunities, but also more responsibility and greater risk in return on investment. Consequently, healthcare organizations must find new methods of financing. Private investment is one of the options. Three healthcare systems were analyzed on the basis of a literature review and document analysis, then schematized to show similarities and dissimilarities with regard to private investment in hospitals. Observations are based on a selection of recently published articles on private-sector financing and its implications for healthcare real estate decision making in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The strengths and weaknesses of three healthcare systems with differing proportions of private and public investment in hospitals were explored. Research revealed a gap between intended effects and actual effects with regard to quality and cost. Costly private finance does not necessarily lead to \"value for money.\" Transferring real estate decisions to private investors decreases the influence of the healthcare organization on future costs and quality. The three healthcare systems show substantial differences between public and private responsibilities. Less governmental involvement affords both opportunities and risks for hospitals. Private investment may lead to innovation, improved efficiency, and cost reduction, provided that the costs and benefits of decisions are not separated between different stakeholders. A missing link between infrastructure provision and healthcare delivery may impede design innovation and optimal adaptation to work processes and could lead to an inefficient allocation of risks and benefits. ","751":"Nature images are frequently used for therapeutic purposes in hospital settings. Nature images may distract people from pain and promote psychological and physiological well-being, yet limited research is available to guide the selection process of nature images. The hypothesis is that higher degrees of presence and\/or influence in the still photograph make it more effective at holding the viewer's attention, which therefore may distract the viewer from pain, and therefore be considered therapeutic. Research questions include: (1) Is there a significant difference in the level of perceived presence among the selected images? (2) Is there a significant difference in the level of perceived influence among the selected images? (3) Is there a correlation between levels of presence and levels of influence? 109 college students were randomly assigned to one of four different image categories defined by Appleton's prospect refuge theory of landscape preference. Categories included prospect, refuge, hazard, and mixed prospect and refuge. A control group was also included. Each investigation was divided into five periods: prereporting, rest, a pain stressor (hand in ice water for up to 120 seconds), recovery, and postreporting. Physiological readings (vital signs) were measured repeatedly using a Dinamap automatic vital sign tracking machine. Psychological responses (mood) to the image were collected using a reliable instrument, the Profile of Mood States. No significant statistical difference in levels of presence was found among the four image categories. However, levels of influence differed and the hazard nature image category had significantly higher influence ratings and lower diastolic blood pressure readings during the pain treatment. A correlation (r = .62) between presence and influence was identified; as one rose, so did the other. Mood state was significantly low for the hazard nature image after the pain stressor experience. Though the hazard image caused distraction from pain, it is nontherapeutic because of the low mood ratings it received. These preliminary findings contribute methodology to the research field and stimulate interest for additional research into the visual effects of nature images on pain. ","752":"Views of nature have been reported to relieve stress and pain, making nature an ideal medium for use in healthcare settings. In hospitals whose design does not allow for a view of nature, virtual and surrogate views of nature may be viable therapeutic options. This study tests the effects of specific nature images, as defined by Appleton's prospect refuge theory of landscape preference, on participants experiencing pain. The hypotheses were: (1) Nature views are variable in their impact on specific psychological and physiological health status indicators; and (2) Prospect and refuge nature scenes are more therapeutic than hazard nature scenes. The research question was (1) Which nature image categories are most therapeutic as evidenced by reduced pain and positive mood? An experiment using mixed methods assessed the effects of four different nature scenes on physiological (blood pressure, heart rate) and psychological (mood) responses when a person was subjected to a pain stressor. Four groups were subjected to a specific nature image category of prospect, refuge, hazard, or mixed prospect and refuge; the fifth group viewed no image. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire and the Profile of Mood States survey instruments were used to assess pain and mood, respectively. Continuous physiological readings of heart rate and blood pressure were collected. Pain was induced through a cold pressor task, which required participants to immerse their nondominant hand in ice water for up to 120 seconds. The mixed prospect and refuge image treatment showed significantly lower sensory pain responses, and the no-image treatment indicated significantly higher affective pain perception responses. The hazard image treatment had significantly lower diastolic blood pressure readings during the pain treatment, but it also had significantly high total mood disturbance. Although there was no clear \"most\" therapeutic image, the mixed prospect and refuge image showed significant potential to reduce sensory pain. The hazard image was the most effective at distracting participants from pain, but it should not be considered a positive distraction because it also received the highest mood disturbance scores of all groups. ","753":"The goal of this project was to create an easy-to-administer and inexpensive tool that can help identify usability issues in a patient room bathroom during the design process so improvements can be made before the final product is constructed and put into operation. The bathroom is an essential part of any hospital patient room, yet it is associated with nurse dissatisfaction and patient falls. Minimal literature has examined whether the physical structure of various elements within the bathroom are efficient, safe, and satisfactory for the majority of users. Furthermore, there is a paucity of human factor guidelines for architects and designers to follow to ensure the usability of bathroom space for a wide variety of users. The authors adapted a common technique used in software usability: the heuristic evaluation. A heuristic evaluation is a \"discount\" evaluation method used to quickly and efficiently evaluate the usability flaws of user interfaces. Three methods were used to provide input for the heuristic evaluation: (1) Review of existing heuristic evaluations, reported hospital bathroom problems, and safety checklists; (2) Interviews with nurses and nursing assistants; and (3) Focus groups with nurses. Analysis of the interview and focus group transcripts enabled the categorization of the types of problems nurses encounter in the patient room bathroom. These categories served as the basis for the heuristics in the heuristic evaluation tool. Eleven major heuristics (or categories of problems in the bathroom) were identified initially. The authors then went through several iterations of designing and refining the heuristic evaluation to form parsimonious categories and subcategories. Each of the eventual six major heuristic categories contains a general description as well as specific exemplar questions. These detailed subcategories enable an evaluator to easily gauge whether a bathroom adheres to the guideline, to write any comments about a particular issue, and to rate the severity of any problems. The bathroom heuristic evaluation was designed to be a discount usability evaluation tool. It can be used to assess a hospital bathroom during the design process for major usability issues, enabling necessary alterations before a final product is developed.

Interventions have predominantly focused on staff and organizational changes, for example monitoring (observation) and communication, possibly in response to increased patient privacy (isolation) in single rooms. The clinical response has been to modify the patient by means of medication review, continence management, and impact protectors.

However, this overshadows another essential component of EBD-the change agent, namely the designer. EBD introduced a new skill set to the practitioner: the ability to interact with scientific evidence. Industry sources suggest adoption of the EBD approach across a large number of design firms. How comfortable are these designers in integrating research with design decision making? Optimizing the interaction between the primary change agent (the designer) and the evidence is crucial to producing the desired outcomes. Preliminary to examining this question, an architectural design studio was used as a surrogate environment to examine how designers interact with evidence. Twelve students enrolled in a healthcare EBD studio during the spring of 2009. A three-phase didactic structure was adopted: knowing a hospital, knowing the evidence, and designing with knowledge and evidence. Products of the studio and questionnaire responses from the students were used as the data for analysis. The data suggest that optimization of the research-design relationship warrants consideration in four domains: (1) a knowledge structure that is easy to comprehend; (2) phase-complemented representation of evidence; (3) access to context and precedence information; and (4) a designer-friendly vocabulary.","760":"This study explores assisted living residents' walking behaviors, locations where residents prefer to walk, and walking environments in and around assisted living facilities. Regular walking is beneficial to older adults' physical and psychological health. Yet frail older residents in assisted living are usually too sedentary to achieve these benefits.

The researcher visited 34 assisted living facilities in a major Texas city. Methods included walk-through observation with the Assisted Living Facility Walking Environment Checklist, and interviews with administrators by open- and close-ended questions. The data from 26 facilities were analyzed using descriptive statistics (for quantitative data) and content analysis (for qualitative data). The results indicate that (a) residents were walking both indoors and outdoors for exercise or other purposes (e.g., going to destinations); (b) assisted living facility planning and design details-such as neighborhood sidewalk conditions, facility site selection, availability of seating, walking path configuration (e.g., looped\/nonlooped path), amount of shading along the path, presence of handrails, existence of signage, etc.-may influence residents' walking behaviors; and (c) current assisted living facilities need improvement in all aspects to make their environments more walkable for residents. Findings of the study provide recommendations for assisted living facilities to improve the walkability of environments and to create environmental interventions to promote regular walking among their residents.

","762":"Evidence-based findings of the effects of nursing station design on nurses' work environment and work behavior are essential to improve conditions and increase retention among these fundamental members of the healthcare delivery team. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate how nursing station design (i.e., centralized and decentralized nursing station layouts) affected nurses' use of space, patient visibility, noise levels, and perceptions of the work environment. Advances in information technology have enabled nurses to move away from traditional centralized paper-charting stations to smaller decentralized work stations and charting substations located closer to, or inside of, patient rooms. Improved understanding of the trade-offs presented by centralized and decentralized nursing station design has the potential to provide useful information for future nursing station layouts. This information will be critical for understanding the nurse environment \"fit.\" The study used an exploratory design with both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative data regarding the effects of nursing station design on nurses' health and work environment were gathered by means of focus group interviews. Quantitative data-gathering techniques included place- and person-centered space use observations, patient visibility assessments, sound level measurements, and an online questionnaire regarding perceptions of the work environment. Nurses on all units were observed most frequently performing telephone, computer, and administrative duties. Time spent using telephones, computers, and performing other administrative duties was significantly higher in the centralized nursing stations. Consultations with medical staff and social interactions were significantly less frequent in decentralized nursing stations. There were no indications that either centralized or decentralized nursing station designs resulted in superior visibility. Sound levels measured in all nursing stations exceeded recommended levels during all shifts. No significant differences were identified in nurses' perceptions of work control-demand-support in centralized and decentralized nursing station designs. The \"hybrid\" nursing design model in which decentralized nursing stations are coupled with centralized meeting rooms for consultation between staff members may strike a balance between the increase in computer duties and the ongoing need for communication and consultation that addresses the conflicting demands of technology and direct patient care.

Space syntax theory has typically been used to study communication in office environments; more recently, it has been applied to the study of healthcare environments. The purpose of this study was to explore the applicability of space syntax theory as a theoretical framework for studying nurses' communication in medical-surgical nursing units in urban hospitals. The nursing profession is rapidly changing, and nurses' work is psychologically and physically intense. At the same time, nurses are responsible for patient safety, optimal care delivery, and patient outcomes (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009; Clarke, 2007; Clarke &amp; Donaldson, 2008; Institute of Medicine, 2000; Institute of Medicine, 2004). Nurses are central to the delivery of care and act as a conduit for communication among members of the patient care team. Some of the design characteristics that create a more appealing environment for patients, such as views of nature and single-patient rooms, may not be fully understood as they relate to nurses' tasks and responsibilities, and they could be detrimental to nursing communication. This study analyzed three medical-surgical nursing unit floor plans using two constructs of space syntax theory, and it verified analysis through three semi-structured interviews with end users. The use of space syntax theory for analyzing medical-surgical nursing unit floor plans is complex. Findings indicated that nurses' perceptions of two constructs of space syntax theory, visibility and accessibility, did not consistently match the anticipated benefits of the floor plan designs. Understanding how and when nurses communicate with each other could help designers of healthcare spaces create more effective environments that support nurses' work and personal health and welfare. The findings of this study suggest that further exploration is needed to confirm this theory's application to healthcare environments.

Based on a framework that physical environment standardization supports process and workflow standardization, thus contributing to safety and efficiency, the study examined the comparative effectiveness of the standardized same-handed configuration and the standardized mirror-image configuration. Patient room handedness has emerged as an important issue in inpatient unit design, with many hospitals adopting the standardized same-handed room concept at all levels of patient acuity. Although it is argued that standardized same-handed rooms offer greater levels of safety and efficiency in comparison to standardized mirror-image rooms, there is little empirical evidence either to support or refute these contentions. An experimental setting was developed where elements of the physical environment and approach to the caregiver zone were systematically manipulated. Twenty registered nurses (10 left-handed and 10 right-handed) provided three types of care to a patient-actor across nine physical design configurations, which were videotaped in 540 separate segments. Structured interviews of the subjects were conducted at the end of each individual set of simulation runs to obtain triangulation data. Video segments were coded by nursing experts. Statistical and content analyses of the data were conducted. Study data show that standardized same-handed configurations may not contribute to process and workflow standardization--hence, to safety and efficiency--any more than standardized mirror-image configurations in acute medical-surgical settings. Data suggest that a global view of the patient care environment upon entry is the most sought-after familiarization factor to reduce cognitive load.

An increasing number of hospitals are being designed using the principles of evidence-based design to improve patient safety and patient satisfaction. Few studies have examined the impact of new hospital design models on providers' attitudes or work performance. The goal of this study was to determine how providers' attitudes at one children's hospital changed over a 2-year period. It was hypothesized that clinicians' attitudes about their work environment would be significantly more positive 2 years after opening. In 2004 a children's hospital within a hospital was replaced with a free-standing facility, which was designed on the theme of family-centered care. The hospital quality improvement team developed and administered the Environment of Work survey to measure providers' initial impressions of the hospital design on job function, patient safety, and personal well-being. The survey was readministered approximately 2 years later to measure changes in providers' perceptions about the same issues. A 25-item survey was administered to a convenience sample of clinical staff to measure their attitudes about the effects of family-centered hospital design on providers and patients. Chi-square tests were used to compare subjective ratings collected from the two surveys on pooled samples and on samples stratified by clinical unit. Surveys were collected from 270 clinicians (a 25% response rate) in 2004 and 544 clinicians (a 51% response rate) in 2006. Nurses accounted for a higher percentage of total respondents (78% versus 57%). Most domain areas garnered improved and overall positive ratings from clinicians in 2006. Providers' ratings of elevated mental fatigue, physical fatigue, and walking burden remained high in 2006 despite improvements. Ratings of noise levels increased on all units except the neonatal intensive care unit. Fewer respondents rated the new hospital \"somewhat to much better\" than the former hospital. Moving into a new healthcare facility is a stressful event for healthcare providers and adapting to a new work environment requires a lengthy period of transition. Providers' initial ratings of a new workspace are likely to change over time as they adjust their work practices to the physical environment. ","782":"The design of the consultation room remains largely unaltered despite major changes in clinical practice, such as the electronic medical record and patient-centered care. The value of redesigning the consultation room to accommodate these changes and the effect of a redesign on patient-clinician interaction are unclear. The authors randomly allocated 65 patient-physician dyads to consultations in a standard room (n = 30) or in an experimental room designed with a semicircular table around which the clinician and the patient sat, with equal access to the computer screen (n = 35). Participant responses to post-visit surveys, assessing patient experiences in these rooms, were compared in an intention-to-treat fashion. The authors found no differences between the rooms in terms of patient satisfaction with the consultation, mutual respect, or communication quality. Compared to the standard room, patients in the experimental room were better able to interact with the computer monitor (24 [75%] vs. 17 [59%], P = 0.07) and had a greater ability to look at the screen at any time (22 [73%] vs. 8 [28%], P &lt; 0.001); and they reported that clinicians allowed them to review the medical record on the screen (22 [71%] vs. 13 [45%], P = 0.012), shared information on the computer screen (24 [80%] vs. 18 [60%], P = 0.037), and reviewed information on the Internet with the patient (13 [43%] vs. 7 [26%], P = 0.010) more than those in the standard room. The design of the consultation room affects the clinical encounter. In particular, ready access to a computer screen using the electronic medical record and the Internet may enhance information sharing.

Gone are the straightforward days of designing a hospital based solely on the programming and function of the space. Now, architects must evolve not only to understand healthcare financing and its availability to clients, but to work in a more collaborative way to design projects. Today, fewer projects are moving forward, creating increased competition among architects. This is also generating more scrutiny in regard to cost control and risk management, which has forced architects to consider alternatives to contractual relationships and design\/delivery methods. New ways of thinking about bringing a hospital to life foster creativity in both the design and delivery processes. Although these changes can be somewhat uncomfortable, they foster learning, collaboration, and ultimately, benefits for all who participate in the process.","786":"Few sectors of the economy have been left unscathed in these economic times. Healthcare construction has been less affected than residential and nonresidential construction sectors, but driven by re-evaluation of healthcare system capital plans, projects are now being put on hold or canceled. The industry is searching for ways to improve the value proposition for project delivery and process controls. In other industries, benchmarking component costs has led to significant, sustainable reductions in costs and cost variations. Kaiser Permanente and the Construction Industry Institute (CII), a research component of the University of Texas at Austin, an industry leader in benchmarking, have joined with several other organizations to work on a national benchmarking and metrics program to gauge the performance of healthcare facility projects. This initiative will capture cost, schedule, delivery method, change, functional, operational, and best practice metrics. This program is the only one of its kind. The CII Web-based interactive reporting system enables a company to view its information and mine industry data. Benchmarking is a tool for continuous improvement that is capable not only of grading outcomes; it can inform all aspects of the healthcare design and construction process and ultimately help moderate the increasing cost of delivering healthcare.","787":"","788":"","789":"","790":"","791":"","792":"The construction trend in healthcare remains strong compared to other construction markets due to the stability of the forces driving the growth.

Successful planning and activation greatly enhance the outcome of any project. Working with an operational point of view throughout the building activation process, beginning with design, benefits both the construction and operational teams. The result is a more positive outcome for the institution, fewer changes during the project for the construction team, and the ability to minimize costly renovations and\/or change orders. Focused and intentional communication throughout the design and construction phase is vital to the activation and success of any project. Developing a communication plan early in the project supports the development of trust and organizational participation. Activation planning must link design and operations to improve project outcomes.","793":"Daylight is usually mentioned immediately after reduced energy use in conversations about sustainable building design, yet in North America, daylight remains the most-asked-for\/least-delivered aspect of the caregiver work environment. In Europe, essentially the same care practices continue to be accommodated in daylit building configurations. Recognizing that the daylighting credits in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for new construction (NC) are more difficult for large healthcare projects to achieve during the design process, and that two daylighting credits are probably not enough of an incentive to change North American healthcare design practice, the Green Guide for Health Care (GGHC) has both simplified the process of calculating daylight achievement levels and increased the number of daylighting credits available from two to five.","794":"","795":"A growing body of literature suggests that face-to-face interaction among clinicians in hospitals affects patient outcomes. How can face-to-face interaction among clinicians be influenced positively to improve patient outcomes in hospitals? So far, most strategies for improving face-to-face interaction in hospitals have focused on changing organizational culture. In contrast, this paper proposes a theoretical model that shows how spatial program and structure can help face-to-face interaction fulfill its purposes in hospitals by controlling the interfaces among different communities of clinicians.","796":"To determine the stated art preferences of pediatric patients through an art survey and determine whether preferences vary, with different age groups associated with different stages of cognitive development. Exposure to visual art has been shown to have an impact on improved health and satisfaction outcomes. However, there is little literature on the effect of art on pediatric patients. While designing pediatric wards, a common assumption is to use fantasy and Disney-like themes; but research across all age groups on whether children prefer these themes is limited. A survey including 20 images with a variety of subject matter and styles was administered to 64 pediatric inpatients (ages 5-17) at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, TX. Children were asked to rate the selection of, and their emotional response to, the images in the survey. Qualitative comments were recorded. Results were analyzed for each of the three age groups (5-6, 7-10, and 11-17 years) according to Piaget's developmental stages, as well as across all age groups. There were significant differences in art preferences across the different age groups, especially with respect to child art (art created by children). Overall, the results for 5-10-year-olds were more significant than those for 11-17-year-olds (adolescents). Nature elements were preferred across all age groups, but all nature images were not rated similarly. Images that were bright and colorful were rated better than images that were pale. The presence of a strong context that children could associate with was a defining feature of preferred images. Content drove preference more than style, though color was a key determinant. Comments on the artwork tended to be more objective\/absolute for the youngest patients and more subjective\/relative for the oldest. The combination of bright colors, engaging themes, and nature content is consistently highly rated by pediatric patients. However, pediatric preferences vary significantly among the three operational stages, so one should be careful before using the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Child art, typically used in pediatric wards, is better suited for younger children than for older children.

This analysis covers both perceived and realized costs across a range of projects in this sector, leading to the following conclusions: Construction first-cost premiums may be lower than is generally perceived, and they appear to be independent of both building size and level of \"green\" achievement; projects are using financial incentives and philanthropy to drive higher levels of achievement; premiums are decreasing over time; and projects are benefiting from improvements in health and productivity which, although difficult to monetize, are universally valued.","798":"","799":"","800":"","801":"An increasing number of clinical treatment modalities feature the therapeutic application of light in wavelengths that correspond to specific colors. How do design professionals connect light and color with form? Until now, such relationships remained largely unexplored.

By describing modalities that combine specific light wavelengths with color and form, this investigation probes material that does not conform neatly to the research data. By exploring Plato's concepts in the form of an environmental experiment, this paper applies ancient theories of healing to current medical applications in conceptualizing the design of a hypothetical spa. The hypothesis is that patients who visit a spa designed to connect form with light and color will experience more effective and timely outcomes than the same patients who visit an ordinary spa.","802":"The quality of the built environment and the public health and well-being of its inhabitants are profoundly interwoven. Among all age groups, the aged are particularly susceptible to disengagement or avoidance of the built environment and the physical exercise options it affords; this can have a deleterious influence on personal health. In this discussion, concepts drawn from the fields of architecture, landscape research, urban and regional planning, and environmental gerontology are drawn together in the context of a hybrid conceptual and operative model. This model is put forth to assist in the acquisition of knowledge in the field to further understanding of how chronic diseases among the aged can be reduced through the provision and utilization of sufficiently supportive outdoor physical activity options in the everyday environment. This hybrid model, the Prospect-Refuge Competency Index (PRCI), combines key elements of prospect-refuge theory and environmental press-competency theory. It can be applied to diverse settings and user constituencies.

EED addresses whether\/how the design and operation of buildings improve ecological value and enhance human health. EBD addresses whether\/how the design and operation of buildings support positive health outcomes in the built environment through a growing collection of solutions informed by research and practical knowledge. The primary hypothesis of this study was that EBD and EED are compatible approaches to health facility design, especially when addressing the impact of the environment on human health. To explore this hypothesis, healthcare facility administrators were surveyed regarding their perceptions of the relationship between EED and EBD. Input from focus groups and EED and EBD experts was used to formulate the administrator questionnaire. The study concluded that the relationship between EED and EBD typically was synergistic.","804":"","805":null,"806":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of color as a component of a healing environment for pediatric patient rooms. Color preferences from pediatric inpatient, pediatric outpatient, and healthy children groups were investigated and compared for group and gender differences. Positive environmental stimulation can promote patient well-being by reducing stress or negative feelings. If environmental colors can have positive influences, then those colors will make patients more comfortable, reducing their stress. Although previous color studies are suggestive, none has focused on pediatric healthcare environments. Patients' health status may affect their reaction to environmental stimulation. There was a gap in the body of knowledge regarding the consistency of color preferences with regard to patient health status. A simulation method was used because of its reliability and feasibility. It allowed for investigating the value of color in real contexts and controlling confounding variables. Previous color preference studies typically have been done with small colored squares of paper, which are visually different from seeing a color applied on wall surfaces. In addition, they failed to control confounding variables such as color attributes and light sources. Group differences were not significant. This refuted the hypothesis that the color preferences of pediatric patients are different from those of healthy children. However, overall color preferences showed that the healthy children group had higher mean scores of color preferences than both pediatric outpatients and inpatients groups. Gender effects were identified across all three groups. All three groups showed similar color preference patterns, except for yellow. Both pediatric outpatients and inpatients preferred yellow less than healthy children did. Healthy children's mean scores of color preferences were higher than the pediatric outpatients; the pediatric outpatients group had higher mean scores of color preferences than the pediatric inpatients group. Although this observation was not statistically significant, it raised the question of whether the sickest pediatric patients respond differently to color than healthy children do. Gender effects indicated that girls preferred red and purple more than boys do. Regardless of gender effects, healthy children and pediatric patients preferred blue and green the most and white the least. These results can help healthcare providers and professionals better understand appropriate colors for pediatric populations.

Hence it is often one of the first items to be value engineered. Aesthetics has (rightfully) been provided preferential consideration in such pleasure settings such as museums and recreational facilities; but in healthcare settings it is often considered expendable. Should it be? In this paper the authors share evidence that visual stimuli undergo an aesthetic evaluation process in the human brain by default, even when not prompted; that responses to visual stimuli may be immediate and emotional; and that aesthetics can be a source of pleasure, a fundamental perceptual reward that can help mitigate the stress of a healthcare environment. The authors also provide examples of studies that address the role of specific visual elements and visual principles in aesthetic evaluations and emotional responses.

Twenty-three issues are considered and categorized under six domains of assessment: (1) patient safety, (2) staff efficiency, (3) circulation, (4) infection control, (5) patient considerations, and (6) family amenities. Use of the framework to rank issues by importance and assess six alternative patient room configurations by a diverse group of experts in a symposium is described. One of the key questions posed during inpatient room design is the location of the bathroom. What issues are affected by the variations in room configuration that arise from bathroom location? A complete articulation of the issues that potentially are affected by room configuration is not available in the literature. The list of issues was developed by the authors in preparation for a symposium. The symposium was organized in May 2007 and attended by 14 experts from four institutions. Six alternative room configurations were used. Variations in the configurations included: (1) three same-handed and three mirror-image rooms; (2) three outboard, two inboard, and one nested bathroom; and (3) three rooms with footwall bathrooms and three with headwall bathrooms. In a four-step process, the attendees ranked the issues, discussed them in detail, rated each room configuration against each issue on a seven-point suitability scale, and conducted an overall assessment of the six configurations. Based on the ratings and rankings provided by the symposium participants, outboard bathroom locations were found to be most suitable, followed by nested and inboard configurations. Furthermore, configurations with patient bathrooms located on the footwall were rated as more suitable than headwall locations. The authors recommend, however, that the framework be used to determine a suitable room configuration in a specific context, rather than to identify configurations that will perform well universally.

As part of a hospital refurbishment program, the planning team of a United Kingdom National Health Service hospital requested a review of a proposed standardized room design. A 7-day observational study was conducted in five clinical departments at three hospitals. Link analysis was used to record and analyze the movements among components, i.e., nursing staff, equipment\/devices, and furniture. Fifty-four observations were recorded for 18 clinical tasks. The most frequent tasks were the disposal of urine and used urine bottles, and returning used commode chairs. Minor recommendations were made to improve the proposed design, and major revisions were suggested to address functionality problems. It was found that the proposed design did not offer the optimal layout for efficient and safe clinical activities. Link analysis was found to be effective for plotting the movements of the staff and accounting for the complexity of tasks. This ergonomic method, in combination with observational field studies, provided a simple and effective way to determine functional space requirements for clinical activities and should be used in all healthcare building design projects.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a review and synthesis of the literature on the effect of physical and organizational aspects of the environment on medication and nursing errors in long-term care environments. Extensive database searches were conducted for relevant publications. In total, 46 empirical and 19 nonempirical (descriptive and conceptual) journal articles, books, book chapters, and reports were analyzed. Environmental variables related to medication and nursing errors are: lighting\/illumination, noise, inefficient layout or use of space, disorganized medication storage or administration areas, look-alike or sound-alike drugs, and equipment. A supportive physical environment is important to reduce factors that may directly or indirectly contribute to errors.

","816":"This report of empirical literature on ambulatory care centers (ACCs) addresses a gap in the healthcare field by exploring physical features of ACC settings that have been associated with favorable patient outcomes. Growing numbers of ACCs correspond with an increasing shift from inpatient to outpatient services. As the focus of ACCs shifts from treating episodes of illnesses to comprehensive, longitudinal, patient-centered care, different types of ACC settings seek to accommodate a variety of patient groups from different demographics. Given the range of ACC settings and population types and the paucity of literature focused on any one of these settings, the literature search process was broad based to include not only peer-reviewed literature, but also \"gray literature\" on ACC design. The primary focus was on research studies and reports that centered on some aspect of the physical environment in ACCs and their relationship to outcomes in these settings. The following patient outcomes were identified in different phases of ACC patient experience: improved access and wayfinding, enhanced waiting experience, enhanced privacy, enhanced physician\/staff-patient communication, reduced patient anxiety, and reduced risk of infection. This article identifies physical design features of ACCs that can promote favorable patient outcomes. However, most literature reviewed adheres to a physician-centered model of episodic illness in which care ends with the experience in the exam room of the ACC. A more patient-centered approach has not been explored fully in the literature. The results indicate that there are many opportunities for future inquiry. ","817":"The primary goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that nurses adopt distinct movement strategies based on features of unit topology and nurse assignments. The secondary goal was to identify aspects of unit layout or organization that influence the amount of time nurses spend in the patient room. Previous research has demonstrated a link between nursing hours and patient outcomes. Unit layout may affect direct patient care time by determining aspects of nurse behavior, such as the amount of time nurses spend walking. The recent nurses' Time and Motion study employed multiple technologies to track the movements and activities of 767 medical-surgical nurses. With regard to unit layout, initial analysis of the data set did not detect differences between types of units and time spent in the patient room. The analysis reported here applies novel techniques to this data set to examine the relationship between unit layout and nurse behavior. Techniques of spatial analysis, borrowed from the architectural theory of spatial syntax, were applied to the Time and Motion data set. Motion data from radio-frequency identification tracking of nurses was combined with architectural drawings of the study units and clinical information such as nurse-patient assignment. Spatial analytic techniques were used to determine the average integration or centrality of nurse assignments for each shift. Nurse assignments with greater average centrality to all assigned rooms were associated with a higher number of entries to patient rooms, as well as to the nurse station. Number of entries to patient rooms was negatively correlated with average time per visit, but positively correlated with total time spent in patient rooms. The data describe two overall strategies of nurse mobility patterns: fewer, longer visits versus more frequent, shorter visits. Results suggest that the spatial qualities of nurse assignments and unit layout affect nurse strategies for moving through units and affect how frequently nurses enter patient rooms and the nurse station.

The first objective of this study was to identify the physical, social, and spiritual attributes of an existing courtyard to determine which features encouraged or discouraged use. A site-specific design concept and user-specific survey instrument were developed to gather data directly from the nursing staff on campus. There has been growing evidence that landscapes for renewal have measurable characteristics. Physical, social, and spiritual characteristics of the landscape interrelate to determine the appropriateness of a landscape for a particular health outcome. Increasingly, evidence demonstrates that contact with the living world around us is an important part of healing and recovery. This design project created a natural opportunity to research the effect of landscape improvements on renewal. The method combined standard landscape architecture ecological site design process with a qualitative empirical study of staff characteristics and landscape preferences. The transparency of the landscape design process provided the basis for a post-occupancy evaluation in the future. Sixty-one nurses participated in the qualitative phase of the design process. Preferences for contact with nature and privacy were significant among the staff. The spatial structure of the concepts was revised to include private table-and-chair places for one or two people and features that would encourage a contemplative pedestrian walk along existing shortcuts. To encourage the benefits of the typical staff's very short exposure to the garden, archetypal landscape features-thresholds, contemplative paths, garden benches, a symbolic creek, and sacred springs-were arranged to shift the spiritual dimension of the place from that of an exposed, dry gulley ravine to a green, fertile oasis.

Simulation allows clients, designers, and researchers to visualize how users might interact with a proposed design before actual construction of the design. This study used mock-ups as a simulation technique during a study of the VA inpatient room standards. The participants used the inpatient room mock-ups as \"interactive laboratory\" environments to maximize opportunities for participatory design, qualitative research, and quantitative research of project-specific EBD solutions. The research used questionnaires, scenarios, on-demand modifications, and observations to evaluate and confirm EBD solutions for inpatient room mock-ups. A total of 71 participants responded to a questionnaire administered across five mock-up work sessions. These 71 participants consisted of administrators, nurses, physicians, support staff, environment and maintenance staff, and patient and staff safety representatives from throughout the VA healthcare system. EBD solutions were tested, evaluated, and modified for each inpatient room type and were applicable to two or more of the inpatient room types. The latter included the location of patient beds and standard headwall position, technology and spaces for nurse charting activities, clearances (e.g., equipment, wheelchair, and bariatric patient), universal rooms, and patient and family amenities. Also, EBD solutions were tested, validated, and modified to the needs of each inpatient room. The mock-ups allowed researchers and designers to evaluate and confirm EBD solutions and strategies for the development of VA inpatient room standards. When used as a means for mixed-methods research, mock-ups can successfully integrate research and design during project-related work. EBD research using mock-ups not only addresses project- or organization-specific concerns, but it may contribute to the knowledge base of the healthcare design community.

A further allowance of up to 28% for Travel and Engineering is then assumed (University of NSW &amp; Health Capital Asset Managers' Consortium, 2005). Therefore the \"circulation\" and \"travel\" space manifested as the corridors and similar movement spaces within health facilities is both extensive and expensive. Consequently, such space often becomes regarded as a necessary evil and, in the name of efficiency, is often minimized wherever possible. This paper revisits the view that corridor space allocations (circulation) must always be minimized to achieve design or functional efficiencies. Minimizing circulation or travel inevitably assumes that the realized space savings will then be reallocated to \"more important\" areas of the facility. Yet the corridors and other movement spaces also are very important to the functioning of multidisciplinary clinical teams and the quality of care delivery. Ultimately, inflexibly reducing the space allocated to such spaces may be regarded as a false economy.","828":"The objective was to review the literature on the use of ceiling lifts to perform patient transfers in healthcare settings. Manual patient transfers present a high risk of injury. Ceiling lifts are increasingly used in healthcare facilities. Despite this, little is known about the effects of this new technology.

Literature citations in the articles and gray literature (e.g., technical reports, conference proceedings, magazine articles, Web sites) were also evaluated when relevant for this review. Experts in this area were contacted regarding information on the topic, potential literature, and for their suggestions. Few studies evaluated the use of ceiling lifts in healthcare. The studies available and the experiences of the experts contacted support the use of ceiling lifts. The musculoskeletal safety of healthcare workers and patients can be improved by the use of ceiling lifts. Having lifts available, organizing the workflow, and reducing the steps required during transfers and handling tasks can significantly lessen the risk of musculoskeletal injuries. Evidence supports the installation of ceiling lifts in patient rooms and recommends their use in bathrooms.

Muslim patients who enter the healthcare environment are often weak and likely to experience feelings of vulnerability. Because of the complex and interwoven nature of culture and religion in a person's identity, it is important to consider patient belief systems and values when designing a patient's immediate environment. Through an exploration of literature related to culture and diversity and the beliefs and value system of the Muslim population, the authors were able to identify flexible design initiatives that could accommodate an array of cultural and spiritual practices. Islam and the Muslim population were chosen as the points of reference for this study because of the strong influence of the religion on the culture, and because of the many nuances that differ from the dominant culture within the United States. From these points of reference, a hypothetical design was developed for a patient room that considers differing notions of privacy, alternatives for cultural and religious practices, and ways to include symbolic meaning derived from attributes such as color.","836":"There is a clear call for a single-source knowledge base linking literature on architecture and human outcomes. However, this seemingly simple need relies upon a vast source of information from multiple disciplines, each with their own vocabulary, structures, and modes of disciplinary thought. The \"Information Age\" provides an abundance of research from the sciences as well as the humanities. Despite unprecedented access via public and licensed databases, searching across knowledge repositories remains a labor-intensive and skilled task. It therefore behooves the design profession to collaborate with experts in research, and to seek new skills for searching, interpreting, and applying evidence to design. The pattern of database usage by 71 professionals involved with evidence-based design in healthcare facilities was studied.

Findings revealed that, during the 28-year period, incremental growth occurred in both room size and departmental square feet in adult inpatient units as well as interventional services. This observed growth and-in many instances- super-sized or excessive growth may be attributed to various factors, depending on the year of construction, regional variability, or level of urbanization. However, at a macro level, growth may be attributed to changes in patient care and operational models; consumer-driven healthcare and market competition; demographics and patient acuity; technology; and regulations and building codes. In the future, forces including but not limited to capital availability, an increased desire for efficiency, and continued escalation in the cost of construction are likely to play an increasing role in offsetting the desire for sizing excess.","841":null,"842":"This research examines whether the physical attractiveness of an outpatient practice influences patients' perceptions of healthcare quality, including patient and staff perceptions of the quality of staff-patient interaction. Despite the high and increasing percentage of healthcare dollars for care delivered on an outpatient basis, relatively little research has examined the relationship between the design of ambulatory facilities and patient outcomes. Few studies have examined how patients' perceptions of healthcare quality differ in the same outpatient practice before and after a move to a new facility designed to be patient-centered. This study is the second phase of a study comparing patients' perceived quality of care in ambulatory facilities that differ markedly in physical attractiveness. Using both a patient and staff survey, and structured interviews, this study compared staff and patient perceptions of healthcare quality (including staff-patient interactions) before and after a move to a new facility designed to be patient-centered. Patients' perceived quality of care, and their perceptions of the quality of interaction with staff, was significantly better in the patient-centered facility. Few differences were found in actual patient-staff interaction behaviors. This study is consistent with other studies that examined the relationship among the physical attractiveness of healthcare settings, patient satisfaction, and perceived quality of care. For this reason, the results are more credible than they would be were they inconsistent with other research or were this the only study examining these issues. These results support the value of investing in the physical attractiveness of patient areas in the ambulatory care setting. Further research is needed to identify specific physical elements that contribute to positive attributions related to quality of care, as well as where the \"tipping point\" is in investments to improve physical attractiveness.

Although no comprehensive theory of the social implications of building design has been developed, these theorists provide concepts that are useful for understanding the organizational processes of shaping and being shaped by the built environment. Insights from the modernist, symbolic-interpretive, and postmodernist perspectives are applied to the experience of design and construction of a medical center in the creation of the Center for Advanced Healing.","845":"The purpose of this article is to (1) demonstrate the utility of the Systems Research Organizing Model (SROM) for evidence-based design; (2) explicate the SROM; and (3) demonstrate how the SROM can advance the science of healthcare design. Grounded in systems science and adapted from the Quality Health Outcomes Model, the SROM was originally designed to assist in the organization of nursing systems research. It is useful for research in other fields as well because it serves as a potential framework for new investigations, allows delineation of key factors in previous research studies, and allows for the synthesis of a body of research knowledge. By means of the latter function, it helps identify knowledge that is ready to be translated to the practice environment. MODEL DESIGN: The SROM is a fully justified model with four core constructs: client, context, action focus, and outcomes. Feedback loops in the model reflect the interrelatedness of the core constructs and recognize the complex nature of the healthcare environment. The SROM may be useful for organizing research studies of interest to healthcare design scientists and practitioners. This framework has promise for organizing studies, identifying gaps in current research studies, and synthesizing multiple studies for application to practice.

It builds on a literature review conducted by researchers in 2004. Research teams conducted a new and more exhaustive search for rigorous empirical studies that link the design of hospital physical environments with healthcare outcomes. The review followed a two-step process, including an extensive search for existing literature and a screening of each identified study for the relevance and quality of evidence. This review found a growing body of rigorous studies to guide healthcare design, especially with respect to reducing the frequency of hospital-acquired infections. Results are organized according to three general types of outcomes: patient safety, other patient outcomes, and staff outcomes. The findings further support the importance of improving outcomes for a range of design characteristics or interventions, including single-bed rooms rather than multibed rooms, effective ventilation systems, a good acoustic environment, nature distractions and daylight, appropriate lighting, better ergonomic design, acuity-adaptable rooms, and improved floor layouts and work settings. Directions for future research are also identified. The state of knowledge of evidence-based healthcare design has grown rapidly in recent years. The evidence indicates that well-designed physical settings play an important role in making hospitals safer and more healing for patients, and better places for staff to work. ","852":"Healthcare organizations face continuous and accelerating external change and thus must be prepared to manage their own change initiatives proactively. Given that many believe that the U.S. healthcare system is broken and most healthcare organizations are dealing with pervasive problems, some organizations may choose to seek transformational change to achieve the six aims identified by the Institute of Medicine: healthcare that is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. Transformational change will almost certainly involve organizational culture. Culture change may be most effective when linked to other organizational change initiatives such as organizational strategy, structure, policies, procedures, and recruiting. Significant organizational change often requires accompanying facility change. There is an interdependent relationship between facility design and organizational culture. They affect each other and both impact organizational performance. Sociotechnical theory promotes joint optimization of the social (culture) and technical (facilities) aspects of an organization to achieve sustained positive change. To achieve organizational transformation and to sustain positive change, organizations must be prepared to adopt collaborative efforts in culture change and facility design. The authors propose a model for accomplishing joint optimization of culture change and evidence-based facility design.","853":"After establishing the connection between building well-designed evidence-based facilities and improved safety and quality for patients, families, and staff, this article presents the compelling business case for doing so. It demonstrates why ongoing operating savings and initial capital costs must be analyzed and describes specific steps to ensure that design innovations are implemented effectively. Hospital leaders and boards are now beginning to face a new reality: They can no longer tolerate preventable hospital-acquired conditions such as infections, falls, and injuries to staff or unnecessary intra-hospital patient transfers that can increase errors. Nor can they subject patients and families to noisy, confusing environments that increase anxiety and stress. They must effectively deploy all reasonable quality improvement techniques available. To be optimally effective, a variety of tactics must be combined and implemented in an integrated way. Hospital leadership must understand the clear connection between building well-designed healing environments and improved healthcare safety and quality for patients, families, and staff, as well as the compelling business case for doing so. Emerging pay-for-performance (P4P) methodologies that reward hospitals for quality and refuse to pay hospitals for the harm they cause (e.g., infections and falls) further strengthen this business case. When planning to build a new hospital or to renovate an existing facility, healthcare leaders should address a key question: Will the proposed project incorporate all relevant and proven evidence-based design innovations to optimize patient safety, quality, and satisfaction as well as workforce safety, satisfaction, productivity, and energy efficiency? When conducting a business case analysis for a new project, hospital leaders should consider ongoing operating savings and the market share impact of evidence-based design interventions as well as initial capital costs. They should consider taking the 10 steps recommended to ensure an optimal, cost-effective hospital environment. A return-on-investment (ROI) framework is put forward for the use of individual organizations.

Based on a series of interviews and case studies and the experience of the authors as researchers, consultants, and CEOs, this paper provides a model for EBD and recommends actions that a CEO can undertake to create an effective project over the life cycle of a building. TOPICAL HEADINGS: Evidence-Based Design: A Performance-Based Approach to Achieving Key Goals; Key Approaches to Executing Evidence-Based Design; Overcoming Barriers to Innovation: The CEO's Vital Role in Implementing Evidence-Based Design The CEO bears special responsibility for successful facility project implementation. Only the CEO possesses the responsibility and authority to articulate the strategy, vision, goals, and resource constraints that frame every project. With the support of their boards, CEOs set the stage for the transformation of an organization's culture and fuel clinical and business process reengineering by encouraging and, if necessary, forcing collaboration between the strong disciplinary and departmental divisions found in healthcare systems.

Katrina stands as the costliest catastrophe in U.S. history, and the city's healthcare infrastructure is similarly striving to resuscitate itself. The incorporation of evidence-based design and research (EBD&amp;R) in the reconstitution of the city's healthcare infrastructure offers a promising direction to improve healthcare outcomes. Recent efforts to incorporate EBD&amp;R in New Orleans' recovery are summarized. EBD&amp;R interventions are needed that take certain key dilemmas into consideration-embracing the adaptive reuse possibilities of historic healthcare facilities, private-public sector collaborations in acute care and in neighborhood-based outpatient care environments, and interventions to serve the city's growing population of medically underserved residents.","858":"","859":"","860":"","861":"Biological and medical research offer rigorous techniques and scientific methodologies to explore how features of the built environment influence human health, performance, and well-being. Practice guidelines from evidence-based medicine and translational science provide models for translating biomedical information into design principles applicable to healthcare environments. Examples from recent scientific discoveries highlight how scientific evidence may inform healthcare design. The interaction between stress and environmental stimuli such as light, sound, and location are relevant to patients, visitors, and staff, influencing cardiac and stress responses as well as cognitive functions such as memory and navigation abilities. Research demonstrating the pervasive influence of light on human biological systems includes epidemiological and laboratory studies that suggest an association between light exposure and increased cardiac or cancer risk. Advances in laboratory research and the development of wearable devices that may be used on-site in healthcare settings facilitate more precise measurement of the environmental features that influence healthcare users and providers. The data derived may serve as the foundation for new evidence-based performance criteria, supporting the use of existing materials and methods, as well as the creation of new design solutions to meet health needs in addition to operational outcomes.","862":"","863":"","864":"The healthcare design community is adopting evidence-based design (EBD) at a startling rate. However, the role of research within an architectural practice is unclear. Reasons for the lack of clarity include multiple connotations of EBD, the tension between a research-driven market and market-driven research, and the competing expectations and standards of design practitioners and researchers. Research as part of EBD should be integral with the design process so that research directly contributes to building projects. Characteristics of a comprehensive programming methodology to close the gap between design and EBD are suggested.","865":"Examine the relationships between acute stress and alertness of nurse, and duration and content of exterior views from nurse work areas. Nursing is a stressful job, and the impacts of stress on performance are well documented. Nursing stress, however, has been typically addressed through operational interventions, although the ability of the physical environment to modulate stress in humans is well known. This study explores the outcomes of exposure to exterior views from nurse work areas. A survey-based method was used to collect data on acute stress, chronic stress, and alertness of nurses before and after 12-hour shifts. Control measures included physical environment stressors (that is, lighting, noise, thermal, and ergonomic), organizational stressors, workload, and personal characteristics (that is, age, experience, and income). Data were collected from 32 nurses on 19 different units at two hospitals (part of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta) in November 2006. Among the variables considered in the study view duration is the second most influential factor affecting alertness and acute stress. The association between view duration and alertness and stress is conditional on the exterior view content (that is, nature view, non-nature view). Of all the nurses whose alertness level remained the same or improved, almost 60% had exposure to exterior and nature view. In contrast, of all nurses whose alertness levels deteriorated, 67% were exposed to no view or to only non-nature view. Similarly, of all nurses whose acute stress condition remained the same or reduced, 64% had exposure to views (71% of that 64% were exposed to a nature view). Of nurses whose acute stress levels increased, 56% had no view or only a non-nature view. Although long working hours, overtime, and sleep deprivation are problems in healthcare operations, the physical design of units is only now beginning to be considered seriously in evaluating patient outcomes. Access to a nature view and natural light for care-giving staff could bear direct as well as indirect effects on patient outcomes. ","866":"The purpose of this project was to understand the nature of an architect's professional power. The central questions were: (1) What is the impact of specialized knowledge on the professional autonomy of architects in general? and (2) What are the relationships between task complexity, specialized knowledge, and the professional autonomy of healthcare architects in particular? To answer these questions, this research utilized interviews and focus groups. Focus groups provided in-depth knowledge on a sub-question: How do real-world situations restrict or reinforce the professional autonomy of healthcare architects? The interviews on this sub-question were project-specific to help gain an understanding of the impact that healthcare design complexity and research utilization have on practice and professional autonomy. Two main relationships were discovered from the interviews and focus groups. One was the relationship between the context of healthcare design complexity and the culture of healthcare design practice. The other was the relationship between changing professional attitudes and the consequences of changes in the profession.","867":"The primary purpose of the research was to assess differences in nurses' perceptions of their job, hospital, and building features following the opening of a new hospital wing. Secondary purposes included assessing the impact on nurses left behind in the existing facility after the new wing opened and considering ways that nurses could more effectively contribute to facility design decisions that directly affect them. Research related to the design of healthcare facilities is growing, yet studies of the impact of facility features on hospital staff is far less common than studies of the impact on patients. Survey data were collected from a hospital's nurses six months before (N=235) and six months after (N=238) some of the nurses (N=65) moved to a new wing. Response rates were 49% and 55% for rounds 1 and 2, respectively. A test study also was conducted two months post-move (N=206) to enable assessment of a novelty effect. Focus groups also were conducted following the completion of round 2 data collection. Significant differences were found between the round 1 and 2 samples for quality of patient rooms, safety, pleasantness, quality of workspace, job stress, job satisfaction, and service quality. Findings from the test study held up in round 2. The design of the hospital impacts nurses and may impact their job satisfaction and stress, even the decision whether or not to remain a hospital nurse. A well-designed hospital is not only important to patients; it also is important to those who serve them.

Yet the literature consistently cites communication among diverse caregivers as a critical component for improving quality of care. This paper reviews relevant literature related to nursing unit design and communication patterns, and suggests an evidence-based design research agenda grounded in the concept of \"organizational ecology\" for increasing our understanding of how hospital design can contribute to improved quality of care.Key Words Evidence-based design, physical design, communication, job stress, nurses.","870":"The healthcare construction boom requires evidence for effective design of nurse stations, including evidence supporting workflow processes, computerization, integration of technology, communication of caregivers, and optimal patient outcomes.

The article focuses on the effects of IHTs on patient complications and outcomes, and the implications of such impacts for designing safer, better hospitals. A review of 22 scientific studies indicates that IHTs are subject to a wide range of complications, many of which occur frequently and have distinctly detrimental effects on patient stability and outcomes. The research suggests that higher patient acuity and longer transport durations are associated with more frequent and serious IHT-related complications and outcome effects. It appears no rigorous research has compared different hospital designs and layouts with respect to having possibly differential effects on transport-related complications and worsened outcomes. Nonetheless, certain design implications can be extracted from the existing research literature, including the importance of minimizing transport delays due to restricted space and congestion, and creating layouts that shorten IHT times for high-acuity patients. Limited evidence raises the possibility that elevator-dependent vertical building layouts may increase susceptibility to transport delays that worsen complications. The strong evidence indicating that IHTs trigger complications and worsen outcomes suggests a powerful justification for adopting acuity-adaptable rooms and care models that substantially reduce transports. A program of studies is outlined to address gaps in knowledge.Key WordsPatient transports, transports within hospitals, patient safety, evidence-based design, hospital design, healthcare architecture, intra-hospital transport complications, acuity-adaptable care, elevators, outcomes.","872":"","873":"","874":"","875":"","876":"","877":"","878":"","879":"","880":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Analyzing the Layout of Long-Term Care Facilities: A Psycho-Spatial Approach.","1":"Executive Summary of Key Concepts.","2":"Evidence, Bioethics, and Design for Health.","3":"Toward Building Surge Capacity: Potentially Effective Spatial Configurations in Emergency Departments.","4":"SPECTRa: An Online Tool for Simulating Prehospital Patient Care.","5":"Physical Environment as a Tool in Caring for the Hospitalized Patient: A Qualitative Study of Nurses' Experiences in Hospitals.","6":"COVID-19 in Long-Term Care Facilities: A Rapid Review of Infection Correlates and Impacts on Mental Health and Behaviors.","7":"Understanding \"Work as Done\": Using a Structured Video-Based Observational Method to Understand and Model the Role of the Physical Environment in Complex Clinical Work Systems.","8":"Postoccupancy Evaluation of a Neighborhood Concept Redesign of an Acute Care Nursing Unit in a Planetree Hospital.","9":"The Demand for Specialization and Its Influence on the Design of Inpatient Nursing Units: Can Standardized Design Be Done Once and for All?","10":"Clinic Design for Safety During the Pandemic: Safety or Teamwork, Can We Only Pick One?","11":"Mapping Healthcare Spaces: A Systematic Scoping Review of Spatial and Behavioral Observation Methods.","12":"Generating Plan Layouts: A Case Study on Visualization of Implicit Knowledge by \"Doctor Architects\".","13":"Patient-Flow Analysis for Planning a Focused Hospital Layout: Tampere Heart Hospital Case.","14":"Drive-Through Urgent Care Centers: Could They Be the Future of Healthcare Facilities?","15":"Study on Collision Detection Techniques for the Informed Design of Natural Views in Healthcare Environments.","16":"A Comparison of Hospital Area Measurement in Germany, Canada, Australia, and the United States: Part 1.","17":"Women's Experiences of Physical Features in a Specially Designed Birthing Room: A Mixed-Methods Study in Sweden.","18":"Unlimited Surrounding: A Scoping Review on the Impact of the Built Environment on Health, Behavior, and Quality of Life of Individuals With Intellectual Disabilities in Long-Term Care.","19":"Healthcare Goes Digital: Designing for the Convergence of the Digital and Physical Environment-Implications for Design Professionals.","20":"Do Home and Community Environments Explain Self-Rated Health Among Older Canadians?
