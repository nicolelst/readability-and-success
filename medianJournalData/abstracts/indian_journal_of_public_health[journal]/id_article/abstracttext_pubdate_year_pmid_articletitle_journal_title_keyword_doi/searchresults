since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, science has unraveled much knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 which has led to extraordinary and unprecedented progress in developing COVID-19 vaccines. Several adverse cutaneous reactions, ranging from more common local injection site reaction, neutrophilic and pustular drug reactions to flare-up of preexisting dermatoses, have been reported with currently available vaccines. We report a case series of 7 patients who developed herpes zoster (HZ) following the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 coronavirus vaccine (recombinant). HZ following vaccination is a rare entity. The occurrence of HZ in the patients presented in this series within the time window 1-21 days after vaccination defined for increased risk and postulated dysregulation of T-cell-mediated immunity, suggests that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 coronavirus vaccine (recombinant) could probably be a trigger for reactivation of varicella zoster virus to cause HZ in them.","2":"Congregate work settings are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and predispose to super spreader events. We investigated a COVID-19 outbreak among security guards to identify the risk factors and propose recommendations. We defined a COVID-19 case as a laboratory-confirmed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive case. We traced the contacts actively and described the cases by time, place, and person. We conducted a case-control study and collected data on potential exposures. We identified 20 (27%) COVID-19 cases among 75 security guards. Among the cases, 17 (85%) were male and 12 (60%) were symptomatic. We recruited all the 20 COVID-19-confirmed cases and 55 COVID-19-negative controls for the case-control study. SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among those had high-risk exposure (60%, [12\/20]) than who did not (16%, [9\/55], adjusted odds ratio = 5.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.6-22.1). Having had high-risk exposure with COVID-19 cases led to COVID-19 outbreak among the security guards. We recommended avoiding the activities predisposed to high-risk exposure.","3":"Managing a pandemic offers lessons for preparing for similar episodes in future. The importance of surveillance in One World-One Health mode and the need to share information expeditiously to mobilize national and international resources has been evident. Pandemics cause disruption to normal social and economic activity, which would be tolerated better if there is trust in authorities. Governments need to guard against over centralization in a health crisis as it discourages community involvement and willing compliance with pandemic-related restrictions. Health emergencies can be managed effectively if health systems have been strengthened during normal times. Financial flexibility needs to be built into the public financial management systems to fund the unanticipated expenditure. The pandemic has underscored the global interdependence and the need to have systems for a global response to health emergencies. Health systems have to be reengineered to better deal with future pandemics.","4":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, differences in health-care system and policies among countries worldwide meant that each country had to come up with their own strategies for containment, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease - \"no one size fits all.\" India being the second populous country in the world with modern and traditional systems of health care has its own challenges to face during the pandemic. Among the increased cacophony of information regarding the COVID-19 disease and controversies surrounding the usage of various radiological modalities for its diagnosis, we are trying to present a sane perspective from an Indian radiologist viewpoint. Knowing the strengths and shortcomings of the Indian health-care system, we have suggested plausible solutions which may be the answers to the issues raised by the Indian media.","5":"India, as a member of the World Health Organization South-East Asia Region, had committed to measles elimination by 2020. Efforts to increase immunization coverage, special immunization activities, and case-based surveillance have been implemented rigorously over the last 7 years, but India has not been able to eliminate measles. Multiple factors led to this namely inadequate vaccination coverage and COVID pandemic and others. The pandemic added its contribution in disruption of vaccine delivery services under Intensified Mission Indradhanush preventing the achievement of the elimination target, in stipulated time. India may need to think beyond strengthening the routine immunization activities and increasing the geographical coverage under Intensified Mission Indradhanush. Promising the future in the measles vaccine delivery system in the form of Measles-Micro-Array-Patches is seen on the horizon may prove to be a game-changer for targeting measles elimination, in the current decade.","6":"India started Point of entry (PoE) surveillance at Mumbai International Airport, screening passengers returning from coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-affected countries using infrared thermometers. We evaluated in July 2020 for March 1-22 with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention evaluation framework. We conducted key informant interviews, reviewed passenger self-reporting forms (SRFs) (randomly selected) and relevant Airport Health Organization and Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) records. Of screened 165,882 passengers, three suspects were detected and all were reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction negative. Passengers under-quarantine line-listing not available in paper-based PoE system, eight written complaints: 6\/8 SRF filling inconvenience, 3\/8 no SRF filling inflight announcements, and standing in long queues for their submission. Outside staff deployed 128\/150 (85.3%), and staff: passenger ratio was 1:300. IDSP reported 59 COVID-19 confirmed cases against zero detected at PoE. It was simple, timely, flexible, and useful in providing information to IDSP but missed cases at PoE and had poor stability. We recommended dedicated workforce and data integration with IDSP.","7":"With 1st case being reported in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, COVID-19 infection cases made their way to every corner of the world. Then, on January 07, 2020, laboratory results led to pneumonia being named as COVID-19. Scant data is available from Northern India, thus to reveal the trend of COVID-19 infection since last year of COVID-19 pandemic onset, this study took shape. The unit of analysis of our study was District Anantnag, Jammu and Kashmir. Till February 05, 2021, a total of 4625 cases of COVID-19 virus were reported in District Anantnag, Jammu and Kashmir. Negative history of close contact with COVID-19 patient (66.1%) constituted the most common exposure, majority (84.4%) were asymptomatic and comorbidities were present in 68 (1.5%). COVID-19 infection was more prevalent among younger age group, with higher male predominance, with comorbid being at higher risk, hence most stringent measures must be adopted.","8":"Multimedia, being more attention-getting and attention-holding, is a powerful tool for mass awareness creation and is used for intervention among students in many studies. Our aim was to see the effectiveness of an educational short film in tobacco awareness generation and to compare it with the traditional lecture-based awareness. Selected schools were divided into two groups as per convenience. Short film was used as intervention in Group 1 and PowerPoint-based lecture in Group 2. The increase in awareness was assessed by a pre and posttest. On analysis, though both methods increased awareness as given by higher posttest score, it is found that the awareness levels showed a statistically significant difference between educational short film on hazards of tobacco and power point-based lecture using Mann-Whitney test. Our study proves that an educational short film carefully scripted and picturized can be used effectively in imparting awareness in school-based tobacco control programs.","9":"Substance use disorder impacts the lives of significant others, more especially the wives of individuals using substances. However, the physical and mental health issues among wives of people who inject drugs (PWID) are less studied. The current cross-sectional, multisite study assessed the physical and mental health of wives of 433 PWID across six sites in Delhi. The mean age of the participants was 32.7 years (standard deviation: 9.7). More than 50% of the participants reported menstrual problems, most commonly dysmenorrhea. Around 55.9% had adverse pregnancy outcomes (abortion, miscarriage, or stillbirth). Around one out of four participants reported at least one specific sexually transmitted infection symptom. Around 11% were diagnosed with tuberculosis and 35% with a major medical illness in their lifetime. More than 90% of the participants had depressive and anxiety symptoms. The study showed that there is a huge burden of physical and mental health issues among the wives of PWID.","10":"This study aims to assess the preventive measures and self-protective rights of employees at the workplace. A survey has been conducted in a steel and power industry of Angul district of Odisha (India) using a semi-structured interview schedule to assess the determinants of occupational hazards. Occupational health practices among 425 male workers were assessed from the steel and power industry using the population proportion to sample technique (PPS). Respondents from the higher educational background, skilled workers, Hindu religious group, general category, and employees with high-household income were significantly associated (P &lt; 0.05) with self-protective rights at the workplace. Industrial workers are considered a vulnerable group with respect to the power of self-protective rights in the industry. The factors such as job insecurity, financial hardship, less education, and unskilled profession make them vulnerable, which forces them to settle with a lower level of rights at the workplace.","11":"The Government of India released operational guidelines for Maternal Near Miss-Review (MNM-R) in December 2014 for implementation at all the tertiary hospitals in India. An implementation research study was conducted at two selected tertiary hospitals in Maharashtra to assess the feasibility of implementation of the MNM-R guidelines at these hospitals and document the experiences and challenges during this process. The study findings suggest that for implementation of MNMR guidelines at these tertiary hospitals, there is need of dedicated staff; revision of MNM facility based form and critical review of the criteria for identification of MNM cases. MNM meetings could not be conducted with Maternal Death Review Committee meetings as mentioned in the guidelines. More efforts are needed for follow-up of the implementation of the corrective measures recommended by the MNM Committee. The study findings indicate that it is feasible to implement the MNM-R guidelines at the tertiary hospitals, if the above points are considered at these hospitals.","12":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), produced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic, giving rise to a serious health threat globally. Many countries have seen a two-wave pattern in there reported cases during the period of pandemic. Similarly, our country has reported the first peak between March and October 2020 followed by the second peak between April and June 2021. The objective of this study was conducted to describe the spatiotemporal patterns and early epidemiological features of COVID-19 cases from November 2020 to May 2021 in the central (Majha) region of Punjab state of India which was considered as the epicenter of the infection. The multiplexed real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was used to detect SARS-CoV-2, with co-amplification of specific target genes using real-time PCR kits. During the second wave, test positivity rate for COVID-19 in our laboratory (the central region of Punjab) was recorded as 4.8%. The study revealed that an increased sustained proportion of COVID-19 incidence is present in young adult age group (20-39 years) with 8.65% positive rate followed by the older age group and least in young ones. It was observed that during the second wave, more symptomatic individuals are positive (10.26%) alongside it was also observed that male population (5.61%) was more prone to infection in comparison to females (3.78%). Whole-genome sequencing carried out on 120 random samples selected from all the districts of Majha region of Punjab state showed two prominent strains, namely alpha variant (95 cases) and delta variant (19 cases). A higher positivity rate in the second wave demonstrates the rapid spread of the new emerging virus variants and warrants the implementation of strict vaccination regimes and quarantine in the affected region. ","13":"Available evidence shows that India's ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response has adversely affected the national tuberculosis elimination program. The study attempted to understand the barriers to successful treatment adherence for female tuberculosis (TB) patients due to disruptions caused by the pandemic. The study draws on qualitative in-depth interviews conducted with patients and TB health visitors from Bengaluru city before and during the pandemic period using a grounded theory approach. While TB has the potential to push female patients who worked in informal arrangements to joblessness and poverty, the pandemic situation has exacerbated these vulnerabilities. The pandemic situation slowed down or suspended vital frontline interventions such as active case finding, distribution of medicine, follow-up of sputum examination, monitoring of medicine intake, and patient support measures. The pandemic-induced barriers to treatment adherence for the vulnerable TB patients can lead to adverse treatment outcomes including disease relapse and drug resistance. It is hence suggested that there is an urgent need for recasting the frontline TB interventions in India in the context of the pandemic in order to achieve the goal of TB elimination. ","14":"Since 1976, several JE outbreaks have been reported from most of the districts of Assam. The present study aims to conduct a descriptive and spatial analysis to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of JE cases of Dibrugarh district. Spatiotemporal distribution of JE cases from 2014 to 2018 at village level was described in maps using Geographical Information System. Spatial association between JE reporting places in the study area has been analyzed using spatial statistics analytical techniques. Temporal distribution of JE cases from 2014 to 2018 for different variable were described in tables. During the period 2014-2018, incidence rate of JE cases ranged between 2.7\/100,000 and 5.9\/100,000 population and highest case fatality rate was 18.3% in 2014. Highest numbers of JE cases were reported in the age group 0-10 years. Most of the JE cases were from rural areas (84.2%). There was a seasonal pattern of JE which peaked in July. There were hotspots around Dibrugarh Municipality area, Duliajan oil town, Hatiali gaon, Naharkatiya chah bagicha, Nagaon Dhadumia gaon, and Nahortoli Tea Estate. On the basis of the study, JE hotspots can be identified that would help health authorities to further investigate and identify the factors responsible for its occurrence. ","15":"Extensive evidence of elevated chromium (Cr) in the surface and groundwater exists. However, the importance of exposure toward Cr-associated health risks in areas with tanneries is still often neglected. These situations prompted an independent research study to investigate the views of those close-knit communities who are being directly affected by this tannery village. To establish an understanding of the local demographics and; exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discover patterns in the occurrence of diseases; measure the awareness of residents of the presence of Cr and its harmful health effects. The EDA technique was used to conduct survey studies on data to uncover patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and validate assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. Out of 14 diseases directly linked to high Cr toxicity, the study reported high levels of diarrhea, epigastric pain, and moderate-to-severe cases of vertigo among those aged more than 22 years. With over 90 active tanneries and toxic Cr released to the environment in a town of &lt;78 km2 area (1.2 tannery\/km), there are only 15 hospitals (0.2 hospitals\/km) for the population currently accommodating more than a quarter-million people daily (3205 people\/km). New mitigation strategies must be put forth to alleviate the negative impacts of the tanneries on the residents and nature most affected as well as the population as a whole. ","16":"Diarrhea and typhoid, ancient water-borne diseases which are highly connected to rainfall are serious public health challenges in the blocks of Kalahandi district of Odisha, India. Corroboration of rainfall and waterborne diseases are available in abundance; therefore, the objective of this article is to calculate the climate and disease vulnerability index (CDVI) value for each block of Kalahandi. We have applied the livelihood vulnerability index with some modifications and classify the three major categories, i.e., exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity into six subcategories. These six subcategories are further divided into 26 vulnerability indicators based on a detailed literature review. The result indicated that the Thuamul Rampur block, the southernmost part of the district is highly exposed to the annual and seasonal mean rainfall, and the Madanpur Rampur block lies in the northernmost part of the district is highly exposed to diarrhea and typhoid. Based on the calculation of the final CDVI value, nearly 50% of blocks of the Kalahandi district fall in the category of very high to high vulnerable zones. Furthermore, it has been observed that factors such as rainfall and disease distribution, vulnerable population and infrastructure, and education and health-care capacities had a notable influence on vulnerability. It is rare to find a health vulnerability-related study in India at this microlevel based on the suitable indicators selected for a tribal and backward region. ","17":"Globally in 2015, 2.6 million stillbirths occurred with estimated stillbirth rate (SBR) of 18.4\/1000 births. India is the world capital of stillbirth accounting for 22.6% of world's stillbirths. The objective of the study is to study the demographic profile of women experiencing stillbirth, to understand the risk factors for stillbirth in low resource settings, and to find the etiology of stillbirth so as to facilitate designing of a stillbirth prevention strategy. This was a cross-sectional observational study done at a tertiary care hospital of Delhi from June 2017 to December 2019. All babies delivered after 20 weeks of gestation showing no sign of life after birth were considered stillborn. Prestructured proforma was filled for each case and data were analyzed. A total of 50,461 births took place during the study period, out of which 1824 were stillborn, making SBR of 36.15\/1000 births of our institution. Most of the women belonged to age group 21-25 years and more than 50% of women were illiterate. Twenty-nine percent of women were completely unbooked, 48% were referred from other centers and 23% were registered at our hospital. Placental causes accounted for 22%, hypertension for 23%, and labor complications for 9% of cases while in 22% cases, cause could not be found. Stillbirth remains a neglected issue. A significant proportion of stillbirths are preventable by adequate antenatal care. Notification of stillbirths will give us the exact figures and realization of the seriousness of the problem which will help us work towards the solutions.

It has become increasingly prevalent with the advancing chronological age and developing of noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory diseases. The paper aims to determine the prevalence of obesity and hypertension and their associated risk factors among the Chiru females of Manipur. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 207 Chiru females of Manipur, whose ages ranged from 20 to 79 years. Anthropometric and blood pressure were measured using standard procedures. Statistical methods such as Chi-square, Pearson correlation, and odds ratio (OR) were employed. The nutritional status of the overweight and the obese are 33.3% and 11.6%. The overall prevalence of high blood pressure was 22.2%. This study observed a significant Pearson correlation between blood pressure and body mass index (BMI), age, physical activity, salt intake, smoking, and alcohol. The binary logistic regression, in terms of OR and coefficient of correlation, shows enough shreds of evidence that BMI and lifestyle factors are strongly associated and correlated with hypertension. The present study found a high prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chiru females, which might have contributed to the overall moderate prevalence of hypertension. Smoking, physical inactivity, and salt intake involve a significant risk of hypertension. Therefore, lifestyle has dramatically influenced the Chiru females of Manipur in terms of hypertension and obesity.

One of the widely used scales for measuring socioeconomic status is the Kuppuswamy scale originally developed in 1976. It must be updated with time as it takes family income into account. The revision of income can be done by using Consumer price index for industrial workers. Conversion factors were given by earlier researchers whenever the base year changed to update the scale. Since the base year has now been changed to 2016, we are giving conversion factor to be multiplied with income categories of 2001 to get the updated scale. We have shown how to calculate the conversion factors and when they are required. We have deducted a conversion factor of 3.26 which is to be multiplied with income categories of 2001 to get the updated scale for February 2021.","23":"Precision medicine (PM) in public health offers a new paradigm. Over a past few decades, there has been very rapid development in science and technology, especially in medical-clinical research to enhance the likelihood of preventive treatment which is personalized to an individual. This combined with digital health and accessibility of environmental and behavioral data offers a unique opportunity for specific prevention advice to individuals and thus to population at large. Indian with its 1.3 billion population and its ethnic diversity with high burden of disease offers a unique opportunity for the role of PM in public health. The article further explores the status and way forward for PM in India.","24":"Generation Z has seen drastic changes in the medical sector with the health-care industry constantly updating itself with newer tools to provide quality treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly tested the services in every aspect of life and has led to an unprecedented increase in the online storage of patient data. Electronic health records (EHRs) are real-time records that make health information of any patient available securely to authorized users. EHRs in the Indian scenario are still in their budding stages, described as \"islands of excellence in an ocean of inadequacy.\" The central institutes and corporate hospitals have implemented it, but the state medical colleges and peripheral health centers have miles to go. These patient data records become an essential tool in physician's decision-making, expertise, and management. One can review the data which is just a click away even after the patients have been discharged, especially in the follow-up period. The current scenario is such that health-care workers and nonhealth-care workers alike share the data of the patients in respect to their records, radiographs, and laboratory data using social media such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram. In the absence of adequate regulations, the reliability of the EHRs is questionable and doubt creates a preference for the traditional medical services among the health-care workers. To conclude, a clear and precise guideline that can enlighten the patient and health-care workers is the need of the hour. The concerns of online storage of data need to be alleviated and privacy regulations need to be addressed.","25":"\"Adivasi\" is the collective term for tribes, an indigenous population, and ethnic minorities of India. In general, tribal populations live in harmony with nature and resources within their habitat and largely reside in segregates in an unpolluted and natural environment away from modern civilization. As per the 2011 census, India contains 705 scheduled tribes (STs) and subtribes and 75 primitive tribal clusters. The ST population of Tamil Nadu, India, was found to be 794,697 and broadly spread in 38 districts constituting 36 tribes, among which 6 tribes were grouped as \"particularly vulnerable tribal groups\" (PVTGs), namely (1) Todas, (2) Kotas, (3) Kurumbas, (4) Irulas, (5) Paniyas, and (6) Kattunayakas, as the number of population in these tribal communities is either declining or remaining static. The state government is offering lots of benefit schemes for the STs, but they have not reached the tribal groups. Health problems of tribal communities have been profoundly influenced by different factors such as social, cultural, educational, economic, and political practices. The tribal peoples are exceedingly disease prone as they do not have access to basic health-care facilities. Therefore, concerned policymakers should focus on the changing health needs of tribal communities. In this regard, the current review article has been focused on the complete details (language, occupation, worship or deity, subdivisions or other names, etc.) of these six PVTGs and also to concentrate on the kind of problems they face while living in the societies. Therefore, the government and nongovernmental organizations need to find a way to improve their livelihoods and health status.","26":"Poisoning is the fourth leading cause of unintentional injuries in children. With continuously changing environment, the epidemiology of poisoning keeps on changing. The present study was undertaken to describe the clinical and epidemiological profile of childhood poisoning in a tertiary care center of New Delhi, India. All children &lt;12 years of age admitted to pediatric ward with a history of ingestion of poison or envenomation between January 2019 and June 2020 were identified, and their medical records were obtained from medical records department. A total of 203 patients were enrolled in the study. Drugs and medications were the most common agents (19.2% cases), followed by prallethrin (13.7% cases). Majority of the cases were asymptomatic. Vomiting (25%) was the most common symptom. Drugs and medications were the leading cause of poisoning, followed by liquid mosquito repellant. This study highlights the change in characteristics of acute poisoning in Indian children.","27":"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a collection of physical, cognitive, affective, and behavioral cyclically occurring symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle which resolves later. The study aims to find the prevalence and symptoms of PMS and risk factors associated with it among school-going adolescent girls in Aligarh. A total of 422 girls (Class 6th to 12th) were taken by systematic random sampling with probability proportionate to size. 37.7% (159) of the girls reported PMS with abdominal bloating (35.2%) as the most common somatic symptom and social withdrawal (69.2%) as the most common effective symptom. The multivariable analysis showed that occurrences of PMS were significantly associated with age, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) (95% confidence interval [CI]): 2.19 (1.22-3.93); education status of participants, AOR (95% CI): 2.97 (1.37-6.45); mothers who are graduate and above, AOR (95% CI): 2.59 (1.40-4.77); working mothers, AOR (95% CI): 1.81 (1.04-3.14); long menstrual cycle (&gt;35 days), AOR (95% CI): 0.40 (0.19-0.85); and irregular cycle, AOR (95% CI): 2.83 (1.48-5.38).

A longitudinal study was conducted among 110 CHO trainees from August 2019 to January 2020. The trainees undertook field visits and survey with lectures and clinical postings. Evaluation was based on pre- and post-Multiple Choice Question tests, the WHO Education of Health Personnel Checklist, Journals, and Logbooks. MannWhitney U-test, Wilcoxon-rank test were used to compare nonnormal variables while t-test was used for comparison of age. Initially, nursing graduates performed better than Ayurveda graduates, especially in punctuality, grasp on problems, and problem-solving ability. Nursing graduates kept better journals and logbooks. Female trainees performed better than male trainees. Ayurveda and nursing graduates were comparable at the end of the training. Need-based training and upskilling of mid-level healthcare providers can be done at scale by roping in medical colleges.","29":"Seasonal variation plays an important role in the occurrence of diarrheal diseases and distinct seasonal occurrence of diarrheal diseases, with bacterial diarrhea occurring more during the warm seasons and viral diarrhea occurring during the drier cool months, has been observed due to seasonal variation. Time-series cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2018 among 553 under-five children to assess seasonal variation of diarrheal diseases and its association with the drinking water quality in a resettlement colony of Delhi. The prevalence of diarrhea was 40.7% and was highest during the rainy season (67.6%). Majority of the water samples were found to be unsatisfactory for human consumption during the rainy and summer seasons. Significant and moderate relationship was found between the seasonal variation and occurrence of diarrhea (r = 0.728, P &lt; 0.05) and most probable number count (r = 0.50, P &lt; 0.05), respectively.

The characteristics of highly cited articles help us to identify important advances and their scientific impact. In the present study, we have identified and analyzed the top 100 most highly-cited articles of COVID-19 research published in the year 2020. A cross-sectional bibliometric analysis was using the search terms \"severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2,\" \"COVID,\" \"nCoV,\" \"Coronavirus,\" and \"HCoV\" querying the Google Scholar database using the program \"Publish or Perish.\" The first 100 English language articles with the maximum number of citations were identified and evaluated in detail. The top 100 COVID-19 articles in 2020 had citations ranging from 1147 to 20,440. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of citations was 1970 (1456-2939). The number of authors ranged from 1 to 79 (median 10; IQR 5.25-19). The majority of first authors was from China (58%), followed by the United States of America (16%) and the United Kingdom (7%). The top three journals in terms of the number of published articles (37%) were the New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet. Most of the top-cited COVID-19 literature were descriptive studies focusing on epidemiology (48%) and clinical course (60%) of COVID-19. Clinical course and epidemiology have been the predominant areas of research interest in COVID-19 in 2020. Citation analysis of COVID-19 literature helps us to map out the most important focus for research in this pandemic and to identify gaps in knowledge which would guide further research.

One of the epidemics which threaten the overall human welfare is human immunodeficiency virus\/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV\/AIDS). In Manipur, the cases of HIV\/AIDS have been reported at significant level. The study aimed to detect the hotspot regions of HIV\/AIDS prevalence in Manipur and to identify the significant factors which influence the HIV prevalence. This study evaluates the spatial variations of HIV\/AIDS prevalence in the state of Manipur, India, from 2011 to 2018. In this study, Getis-Ord Gi* statistic was used to detect the HIV\/AIDS prevalent regions. The ordinary least square (OLS) spatial statistics embedded in the ArcGIS were employed for exploring the spatial relation between HIV\/AIDS occurrence and the predictors. It was observed from the hotspot results that Churachandpur, Ukhrul, and Thoubal are the blocks where HIV\/AIDS is more prevalent. Six factors associated with the prevalence of HIV\/AIDS were found to be significant. The most obvious factor influencing HIV in the region is illiteracy. The constructed OLS model has the highest value of adjusted R2 statistic equals to 0.67 and the lowest value of the Akaike Information Criterion statistic equals to 474.55. The use of hotspot analysis, regression analysis, spatial autocorrelation, and GIS can aid health planners in properly assessing and identifying spatial prevalence of diseases among the masses to better guide evidence-based health planning decisions. ","35":"Rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) for animal bite victims is usually administered around the wound without the use of any anesthetic. Theoretically, the topical use of 2% lignocaine can reduce the pain during the procedure. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of 2% lignocaine medicated pad (LMP) for reducing pain during administration of RIG. A randomized triple-blind controlled trial was done in a tertiary care setting in Kerala, India. The proximal and distal wounds of the patient with minimum two, Category III animal bite wounds were randomized to intervention and placebo arms, based on a previously generated random number sequence. Sterile gauze pads soaked with 2% lignocaine and normal saline were the intervention and placebo, respectively. Pain was the primary outcome measure and was assessed using numeric rating scale (NRS) and sound, eye, and motor pain (SEM) scale. The patient, outcome assessor, and statistician were blinded. The wound sites and size of 100 intervention and 100 control wounds were comparable. The score of all elements of the SEM, total SEM, and NRS score were significantly lower in the wounds, which were given LMP compared to the control wounds. The number needed to treat for satisfactory pain relief and immediate pain relief was 25 and 14, respectively. No serious or minor adverse events were reported in the trial. The use of a proven drug in a topical route optimizes pain reduction from iatrogenic cause for millions of animal bite victims around the world with very little additional financial burden. ","36":"Childhood injury has been identified as a grave public health problem globally as well as in India. Most studies have reported injuries to have occurred while the child was at home, though injuries while on road, school, or playground also commonly occurred. The objective of the study is to find the association between unintentional childhood injury and the activity and location of the child at the time of injury. The present study is part of a larger study for preventing childhood injuries, conducted from August 2017 to January 2019 in Delhi, and reports the activity and location of the children at the time of injury. A total of 173 injuries that occurred during the total study duration were included in the analysis. Data regarding activity and location of the subjects were collected and analyzed by case-crossover study design, during \"case\/hazard period\" and two \"control\/reference periods.\" Majority of the injuries occurred while the subjects were at home and engaged in activities other than normal activity. When various locations and activities were combined, unmatched odds ratios (ORs) were raised for activity other than normal activity (statistically significant) and for location other than at home. Similar results were obtained for matched Mantel-Haenszel OR, with activity other than normal being significantly more risk for injury (P = 0.000). Majority of unintentional injuries occurred in children and adolescents, while the subjects were away from home and engaged in any activity other than normal daily activities. This indicates the importance of teaching safety behavior to children so that they can prevent being injured wherever they go and whatever activity they perform.

Nowadays, we do not just use our smartphones, but we rely on them. The present study aims to develop and validate an instrument measuring the problematic use of smartphones among adults in a rural area of West Bengal, India. The questionnaire on problematic use of smartphone is a self-designed tool. The items were selected by literature review. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire were assessed by content validity, construct validity, and reliability. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to identify the factors. Forty-two items were generated by literature review. After final analysis, the main questionnaire contained 28 items with 5 domains, namely \"impulsive use of phone,\" \"dependence,\" \"impaired control,\" \"denial,\" \"decreased productivity,\" and \"emotional attachment.\" The Cronbach's alpha value for three domains was found to be &gt;0.7 and &gt;0.8 for the other three domains.

","39":"The debate around approaches to health sector reform is one of the foundational questions around which the discipline of health policy and systems research has grown. In the immediate postwar period, health and health care were recognized as areas of market failure, requiring state action in the provision of free or subsidized services. In the eighties and nineties, due to both geopolitical and ideological reasons, this understanding changed, leading to a wave of market-based health sector reforms. An academic discourse built around neoliberal economics initiated, shaped, and legitimized these reforms. Faced with worsening health outcomes and costs of care after a decade of such reforms, there was a partial reversal of policy toward improving health sector performance that relied on nonmarket solutions built around notions of solidarity, trust, and rights. In India, this took the form of the National Rural Health Mission. Examples of health systems research that supported this direction of change are discussed. In the last decade, a second wave of health sector reforms sought to make markets work by repositioning government as purchaser of health care from private providers through insurance and contracts. There is little evidence that this worked. The need to rely on public services to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, further questioned this direction of reform. We emphasize the need to expand and develop a framework of health systems and policy studies that are more appropriate to the achievement of universal health care, health equity, and health rights in the Indian context.","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"There were many challenges faced by both health-care workers and the common population during the COVID-19 pandemic.

India ranks first with an estimated 675,188 number of cases and 20,256 number of deaths annually with one-third of its population at risk. The two broad approaches for cholera control are improving sanitation and vaccination. Now both live and killed oral vaccines are available. Live vaccines are advantageous in respect of intestinal colonization and rapid immune response and also lead to in vivo exposure of bacterial products leading to good immunological response against wild Vibrio cholerae infection. The three major delivery strategies which can be considered for the implementation of oral cholera vaccine are preemptive vaccination, reactive vaccinations, and National Immunization Program. We propose the use of cholera live oral vaccines for achieving control of this disease by repeated vaccination of the susceptible population in a series of pulses to control it from the entire population.","47":null,"48":"Citarum River in West Java, Indonesia, is the most polluted river in the world which pollutes the ocean. This is caused by lack of community empowerment for domestic waste prevention and management.

The present study aimed at determining factors associated with late antenatal care (ANC) initiation among pregnant women attending a comprehensive health clinic in Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Of the 420 pregnant women, 281 (66.9%) presented late (&gt;12 weeks) for their first ANC visit. The multivariable analysis showed that women with lack of knowledge on when to start ANC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =4.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.63-8.84), not planned last pregnancy (AOR = 3.07; 95% CI: 1.72-5.5), and no ANC visit in the past (AOR = 17.56; 95% CI: 5.89-52.3) were significantly associated with late ANC initiation. Cox and Snell R2 was 0.2 and Nagelkerke R2 was 0.4. This study has found high rates of late ANC initiation among pregnant women in the study area. The factors associated with late ANC initiation should be addressed to contribute to the reduction of late ANC initiation, and this in turn can improve maternal and fetal health.","50":"Postmenopausal women are routinely prescribed calcium and Vitamin-D supplements in view of their increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

An exploratory qualitative study was conducted among 75 Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery students who underwent the training program as part of their undergraduate medical training using \"most significant change\" technique. The responses collected were analyzed using the inductive approach of thematic analysis. Majority of the participants opined that the program not only has enabled them to better understand their academic learning but also has provided a social learning experience. The student feedback throws light on the potential of such community-based learning programs to inspire the students to become a more humane version of themselves. This study observed that the remote hospital-based training has positively influenced the students.","52":"India despite progress in tobacco cessation delivery in government sector has lagged in private health sector. Adopting a two-fold approach of intensive intervention-based counseling with (or without) pharmacotherapy; and prescheduled proactive follow-ups over the subsequent year, this study reports 337 tobacco patients, each followed for a period of 1 year. It observed a quit rate (QR) of 40.9% for total abstinence at 1 year but with a drop of 15.9% when patients were followed up, up to 6 months (49.6%) versus 6-12 months (34.7%). The pharmacotherapy did not benefit to whom it was prescribed (196 [58.2%] patients; QR: 34.7%) versus the rest to who it was either not prescribed or was declined (141 [41.8%] patients; QR 49.6%). Countrywide tobacco cessation clinics (TCCs) may be established in private sector hospitals, and the component of quitline methodology of making proactive calls may be integrated to improve QR in India.","53":"The high prevalence of diabetes, urinary tract infection (UTI) in persons with diabetes, and antibiotic resistance throughout the world including India is a cause of concern for health-care providers. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of uropathogens, their resistance pattern, and associated factors of UTI among adults with diabetes. A cross-sectional study was conducted during the year 2018-2019 among 504 adult diabetic patients attending a tertiary care hospital of Bhubaneswar, Eastern India. Using recommended culture methods, clean-catch midstream urine samples were examined for the presence of pathogenic bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The prevalence of UTI was 75.4% and the predominant isolates were Escherichia coli (25.6%), Enterococcus spp. (18.7%), and Klebsiella spp. (8.1%). Most of the bacteria isolates were sensitive to nitrofurantoin (80.8%), gentamicin (76.8%), and amikacin (72.1%) whereas resistant to cefpodoxime (77.6%), cefixime (70.8%), and cefadroxil (65.0%). The overall multidrug resistance (MDR) to two or more antimicrobial agents was observed in 87.4% bacterial isolates. The odds of developing UTIs were significantly higher in females with diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.04; 95% confidence interval CI: 1.33-3.13), those with Stage I\/II hypertension (AOR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.04-3.008), and those having glycated hemoglobin level &gt;9% (75 mmol) (AOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.13-4.10) compared with their counterparts. The prevalence of UTI and MDR to commonly used antibiotics among diabetic patients is alarming, and thus, isolation of uropathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is crucial for the treatment of UTI in persons with diabetes. ","54":"The Government of India introduced a new cadre of Community Health Officers (CHOs) in the primary health-care system through the Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) program. The study aimed to assess the activities performed and time spent by the existing and new primary health-care team members at the HWC level. A time and motion study was undertaken in four HWCs in Punjab over a period of 3 months, to assess the time spent by auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and CHOs on different services and activities. Data were collected through direct continuous observation of four CHOs and four ANMs during working hours for a period of 6 consecutive days of a week, along with structured time allocation interviews of all participants. The CHOs spent 5.7 (5.6-5.9) hours per day on duty of which 57% was productively involved in service delivery. The average time spent by ANMs was 4.9 (4.5-5.3) hours per day, with nearly 62% productive time. While the CHOs spent nearly 40% of their time on services for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the ANMs spent 51% of their time on maternal, infant, child, and adolescent health services. The introduction of HWCs and CHOs has nudged the health system toward comprehensive primary health care by placing a renewed emphasis on NCDs.

However, little is known about the age-and sex-specific mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) cut-offs for identifying overweight and obese adolescents. The present study was planned to assess diagnostic performance of MUAC in identifying overweight and obese adolescents and estimating age specific MUAC cut-offs, separately for males and females, taking body mass index for age Z-score (BAZ) as the gold standard. The present study is secondary data analysis using Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey, India, on 31,471 adolescents. The, area under curve receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and Youden Index were used to estimate MUAC cut-offs for overweight (BAZ &gt; +1) and obesity (BAZ &gt; +2). The MUAC cut-offs to identify overweight were: For 10-14 years- 22.9\/23.4 cm, for 15-19 years - 27.0\/25.6 cm for males and females, respectively; and for obesity were: For 10-14 years - 24.5\/25.1, for 15-19 years - 28.5\/28.0 cm for males and females, respectively. For overweight, among males, the age-specific cut-off ranged between 21.2 cm (10 years) and 29.8 (19 years), and for females ranged between 21.2 cm (10 years) and 26.7 cm (19 years). For obesity, it ranged between 22.4 cm (10 years) and 31.1 cm (18 years) for males, and 23.9 cm (10 years) to 26.9 cm (19 years) for females. For obesity, AUC ranged between 0.81 and 0.92, indicating good to excellent diagnostic accuracy.

Pimpri-Chinchwad township with a population of over 25 lakhs is located in Maharashtra, one of the worst affected states in India. After the incidence peaked in the township in mid-September 2020, cases started declining even as lockdown restrictions were eased. A seroprevalence study was conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of the pandemic in this region. We carried out a population-based seroprevalence study for IgG antibodies for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) among 5000 residents 12 years and above selected by the cluster random sampling. We selected 50 clusters in slums, 80 clusters in tenements, and 70 clusters from housing societies. The field work for collection of samples was carried out from October 07 to October 17, 2020. We used kit from Abbott (SARS-CoV-2 IgG), which employs chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology. The prevalence of IgG antibodies was expressed as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). These were weighted for areas and cluster effect and further adjusted for test performance. The overall seropositivity for IgG was 34.04% (95% CIl 31.3%-36.8%). Slum dwellers had 40.9% positivity rate (95% CI 37.0%-44.7%), those in tenements 41.2% (95% CI 37.7%-44.8%) and people living in housing societies had 29.8% positivity (95% CI 25.8%-33.8%).

The study was conducted to find out the coverage of health insurance and its determinants among MIH. It was a community-based sequential exploratory mixed methods study. Group interview and key informant interview were conducted among various stakeholders related to insurance coverage. The quantitative survey was done among 400 randomly selected head of households (HoHs) in an urban area of Puducherry. Manual content analysis was done for qualitative data. Generalized linear model with Poisson distribution was used to calculate the adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) using Stata software. The coverage of health insurance among the MIH was 41% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 36.1-50). The major reasons reported for not having insurance were poor financial status (63.7%) and lack of felt needs (59.4%). The significant determinants for the lack of health insurance among MIH were unskilled occupation (aPR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.13-2.34) and lower education status (aPR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.22-2.64) of HoH and less monthly family income (aPR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.18-4.08). The health insurance coverage of 41% among MIH is better despite the fact that there was no public insurance scheme available for them in Puducherry.

This aimed to estimate the prevalence of dietary diversity and to assess factors associated with it from caregivers' perceptions by quantitative and qualitative participatory techniques. A mixed-method study comprising community-based cross-sectional quantitative and participatory rural appraisal qualitative components was conducted in 25 villages from the field practice area of medical institute in South India during 2017. Caregivers of eligible children 6-23 months from villages were interviewed regarding various food groups consumed in the last 24 h using a validated checklist. Association of demographic-, child, and mother-related characteristics with inappropriate dietary diversity was identified using multivariate negative log-binomial model. Of the 603 eligible children, 75.1% had inappropriate dietary diversity. Although inappropriate dietary diversity prevailed across all categories, mothers with less than primary education (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.26) children &lt;1 year (adjusted PR: 1.29) and not on current breastfeeding (adjusted PR: 1.15) had significantly more inappropriate diversity. Restraining and motivating forces for dietary diversity were initially recorded from free listing and subjected to force-field analysis. Ignorance, lack of literacy, affordability issues, nuclear family pattern, and influence of junk foods are restraining forces. Inappropriate dietary diversity among 6-23 months children in the rural block of Tamil Nadu, South India, is extensive (75%).

Despite more than three decades of fluorosis prevention efforts, fluorosis continues to be a widely prevalent disease in India. The debilitating effects of skeletal fluorosis are well documented and pose a serious health risk to people who consume excess fluoride. In order to understand whether fluorosis was being given importance as a public health problem by elected politicians, we analyzed parliamentary questions posed in both the houses of the Indian parliament during the question hour. Thematic analysis revealed three major themes, namely health hazards, fluorosis control, and magnitude of fluorosis. The analysis revealed that politicians have posed questions regarding all the aspects that are necessary for fluorosis control in India. However, we have identified the certain key issues which have to be improved and certain obligations that the Government of India has to fulfill for successful fluorosis mitigation in India.","95":"In the COVID era, medical education has been hit hard. Paradoxically, the need for health professionals has increased. Online methods are being widely used, but its efficacy is rarely measured. This study was conducted to find the efficacy of an online course in developing competency among medical students to prescribe balanced diet. An online module was hosted at https:\/\/drzinia.moodlecloud.com\/. A noninferiority trial was conducted among voluntary participants of the third MBBS students, in 2019. Stratified block randomization was done, so that ten students were allocated to the intervention arm of online sessions and ten students were allocated to the control arm of classroom sessions. Pretest assessments, seven assessments related to sessions conducted, and a postassessment were done. Generalized estimating equations were done to adjust for the effects of other confounders and see whether the intervention was a significant determinant of ability to prescribe balanced diet. Baseline variables were comparable in the two groups. The pretest scores were not significantly different in the two groups. The mean total marks scored by the online group (47.33\/70) was not significantly different (t=0.68; p=0.50) from that of the class room group (45.70\/70). The posttest scores were significantly higher than the pretest scores. Ninety-percent of students in the online course agreed that they could effectively learn through an online course. Online teaching is effective to learn the prescription of balanced diet. Similar efforts in other domains can make medical education evidence based in the current scenario.

This study aimed to ascertain the resource requirement for establishing an OR health-care facility and patient satisfaction with regard to the services being provided. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 at an OR Outpatient Department (OPD) of AIIMS, New Delhi, at Jhajjar. Service delivery model adopted for health-care delivery was hub and spoke. Traditional method of costing was used for economic evaluation. Feedback pro forma of 400 patients who attended OPD services was analyzed to measure health service accessibility. Capital expenditure to set up the facility was calculated to be approximately INR 17,57,49,074\/- ($ 2,703,832) and operational cost per year was approximately INR 8,73,86,370\/- ($ 1,344,406). Approximate per-patient cost for single OPD consultation was calculated to be INR 874 ($13.45) which included medicines and investigations. High scores for all domains of accessibility of health care were observed. The study provides a preliminary evidence that OR health-care facilities can be instrumental in increasing access to health-care delivery with lesser capital outlays, however, large-scale multicentric studies are needed to arrive at any conclusion. The services have been very well accepted by the local community members being quality medical care with highly subsidized health-care services.

To assess the perception of smokers about their quitting behavior on price increase in smoke tobacco product. A population-based cross-sectional study among people who were 18 years of age and above was conducted in 2017 among 277 participants in Haryana. Global adult tobacco survey 2009 questionnaire with objective oriented modification was used to examine the willingness to pay (WLP) for a smoked tobacco product, maximum price for quitting smoking, reinitiating smoking, and the knowledge about harmful effects of using tobacco products. Descriptive statistics and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to find the relationship among various demographic characteristics and price of quitting smoking. Among the participants, 65 (23.4%) were found to be current smoker and of them 48 (74%) smokers responded to quit smoking on increasing the price of smoked tobacco products. Average daily price paid by the smokers was Rs. 23 and Rs. 8 for cigarettes and bidis, respectively. The odds of quitting smoking among cigarette smokers were higher than those of among bidi smokers (OR = 5.2, 95% CI 2.877-10.04). The odds of quitting smoking among those spending more than Rs. 10\/day were lower than those spending &lt;Rs. 10 on these products (OR = 4.8, 95% CI 1.1-22.3). 72.9% of the smokers declared &gt;100% increase in current price for quitting smoking.

Globally, depression and anxiety cause immense suffering and disability among mothers who later contribute to compromise parenting practices and increased unmet needs of their newborn and young children. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and determinants of maternal common mental disorders (CMDs) among the study population. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India, from July 2016 to June 2017, among 415 women of child-bearing age who had one or more children in the age group of 0-23 months. A World Health Organization prequalified questionnaire Self-Reporting Questionnaire 20 was used to assess the CMD of mothers. Binary logistic regression was used for finding out predictors of mental disorders. Overall prevalence of maternal CMDs was 38.8%. The prevalence of maternal CMD was significantly higher among mothers in a higher age group, belonging to low socioeconomic class, nuclear type of family, living in the urban locality, having lower or no education, being single mothers, housewives, and having higher parity. Substantially, high prevalence of CMD among mothers suggests for further research to explore the factors affecting the mental health of mothers. Measures for the early identification, treatment, and prevention of maternal mental disorders should be taken.

The objective is to estimate COVID-19 seropositivity among contacts of COVID-19 cases and to compare the seropositivity between types of contact for the assessment of differential risk and transmission dynamics. Large scale population-based serosurveillance on contacts of COVID-19 cases was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the COVID-Kavach. The seropositivity among contacts was estimated and correlated-compared with type of contact and other demographic factors. With 1268 positive for IgG antibodies from 3973 samples, the seropositivity against COVID-19 among contacts of cases in Ahmedabad was 31.92% (95% confidence interval 30.48%-33.38%). The seropositivity among family contacts was significantly higher (39.36%) as compared to other contacts (28.72%) (Z = 6.60, P &lt; 0.01). This trend is seen across all age groups and both the sex groups. The seropositivity has increasing trend with increasing age and is significantly higher among females (35.11%) than males (28.95%) (Z = 4.16, P &lt; 0.01). Seropositivity of 31.92% among contacts indicates that a large proportion of contacts have already acquired immunity on account of their contact with the case. Higher seropositivity among family contacts justifies the risk categorization and testing strategy adopted for the contacts of the cases. This also reaffirms the need for contact tracing strategy for controlling the inevitable spread of pandemic.

Most of the risk factors for death in children between 6 and 59 months of age are directly or indirectly related to health service delivery and can be ameliorated through proper structural and administrative measures. ","129":"Combustion of kerosene and biomass fuel in the kitchen as cooking medium is one of the major sources of indoor air pollution. Such contaminated indoor air quality adversely affects the respiratory health of exposed individuals over a period of time. Homemaker women especially residing in slum areas are always vulnerable to indoor air-pollution-related health hazards. The objective is to assess the relationship between various socio-demographic factors and usage patterns of cooking fuel; and to determine the effect of cooking medium namely biomass, kerosene on pulmonary function parameters. A cross-sectional observational study was carried out during April 2012 - April 2016 among 531 nontobacco addicted adult primary homemaker women residing in slums of Ahmedabad city of Gujarat. Basic information-related socio-demographic parameters were collected on a pretested questionnaire. Pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters were evaluated with standard techniques. The statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS software (version 17.0). Statistical tests of significance between groups and mean along with multivariate linear regression analysis were applied. Predominant cooking medium for nearly 40% of slum households were kerosene and biomass. Mean value of forced expiratory volume in the 1st s (FEV1) and FEV1\/forced vital capacity (FVC) were significantly lower among Kerosene and biomass users compared to LPG users. Multivariate regression analysis with involvement of PFT parameters, cooking medium, and environmental tobacco smoke exposure (ETS) shows, deprivation of both FEV1 and FEV1\/FVC were significantly related with the usage of kerosene and biomass; whereas no relation found with ETS. Reduction of pulmonary function parameters among the study participants were related with kerosene and biomass fuel usage in the kitchen. ","130":"Ensuring universal access to sanitation in households is essential for public health. The objective of the study was to assess the availability of sanitary latrine at the household level and its use at the individual level in a rural area and factors associated with availability and use of sanitary latrine. This cross-sectional study was conducted from December, 2016 to January 2017 (mention month and year) at the rural Health and Demographic Surveillance Site, Ballabgarh, in district Faridabad, Haryana, North India. A total of 16,896 households were studied. House-to-house visits were made by trained health workers who conducted interviews regarding availability and pattern of use of sanitary latrine in the household. The health worker also observed the type of sanitation facility, its functional status, availability of water, and hand-washing facility. Individual household latrine (IHL) was present in 87.3% of the households. An improved sanitation facility was available in 84.8% of the households, while 15.2% of the households had unimproved or no sanitation facility. Hand-washing facility along with improved sanitation was present in 70.4% of the households. Nonavailability of latrine among socially disadvantaged communities (scheduled caste households) was significantly higher (19.4%) as compared to other castes (10.4%) (P &lt; 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of households below poverty line (28.9%) lacked IHL as compared to those above the poverty line (11.0%) (P &lt; 0.001). Nearly 11% of the individuals reported open defecation. The availability of sanitary latrines in the study area was high. Nonavailability of in-house sanitary latrine was higher among economically poor households and those belonging to socially disadvantaged communities.

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence, level, and sources of occupational stress among CHWs and coping strategies adopted by the CHWs. This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to April 2019 among 347 CHWs in 16 Primary Health Centres of Mangalore taluk, Karnataka. Occupational Stress Index and the Brief COPE scale were used to assess the stress level and coping strategy, respectively. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used. The P = 0.05 was considered as significant. The prevalence of occupational stress was found to be 40.5%. Stressors such as under participation, powerlessness, low status, and unprofitability were significantly associated with occupational stress. CHWs used various coping strategies such as self-distraction, active coping, denial, substance use, behavioral disengagement, venting, positive reframing, humor, and self-blame to manage their stress. Stress intercession programs could be conducted on a regular interval to make CHWs \"stress-free\". Higher stress level might impede the performance of the workers, and hence addressing this is necessary. Similarly, positive coping strategies, such as active coping, should be promoted to manage stress. ","132":"Village health sanitation and nutrition day (VHSND) was conceived under the National Rural Health Mission to deliver maternal and child health and nutrition services at the village level in the anganwadi center. Multiple challenges, including a lack of convergence of frontline workers, were affecting service delivery at VHSND. As a public-private partnership Piramal Foundation proposed to revive the concept of VHSND. The present study was aimed to demonstrate a model of VHSND to provide primary care related to maternal and child health and nutrition at the village level in 25 aspirational districts across seven states of India. The descriptive study was undertaken as a pilot phase. Of the purposively identified 506 VHSND sites, monitoring data on delivery of six basic primary care services at VHSND, collected as part of routine operations were compared for 229 sites for the month of September 2018 (baseline) and January 2019 (endline). In model sites, there was the increased availability of drinking water and functional toilets; a significant improvement of availability of equipment for providing antenatal care services, immunization, and growth monitoring. However, the supply of drugs at these sites did not show a statistically significant change. There was also a significant improvement in the engagement of the Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC) in the villages of the model VHSND sites. The model demonstrated the significant changes with effective supervision and participation of VHSNC members, demand generation activities complemented with improved supplies and widening range of services at the VHSND are required to be undertaken.

This study aimed to determine the pattern of bacterial contamination of surfaces of OPD tables in relation to existing cleaning\/disinfection practices. The descriptive study was conducted during July 2018-September 2018. A total of 128 swabs were collected from 32 OPD table surfaces immediately after cleaning or disinfection and then at 30 min, 2 h, and 4 h interval after cleaning or disinfection. Type and concentration of cleaner or disinfectant, number of cleaning strokes on table, and time of last washing of cleaning cloth with detergent were also noted from each location. Isolation, identification, and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by standard microbiological techniques. A total of 337 bacterial isolates were recovered from 126 samples. Multidrug resistant Staphylococci, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Escherichia coli were isolated. The mean bacterial colony count increased with time (P &lt; 0.0001). Hand rub use, cleaning of OPD table surfaces with disinfectant, and more number of strokes with cleaning cloth resulted in decrease in colony count of bacteria isolated. High bacterial contamination of frequently touched OPD table surfaces with variety of potential pathogens like Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and E. coli was detected. Hand hygiene among health-care workers and regular and frequent cleaning and disinfection of OPD table surfaces are highly recommended to prevent cross-transmission.

The causative role of acidic nature of drinking water has not yet been investigated in Kerala. We attempted to determine the spatial association between the occurrence of self-reported hypothyroidism and pH of ground water using the geographic information system. The cross-sectional study was conducted among 1649 individuals residing in the subcenter area in urban Trivandrum. Self-reported hypothyroidism was obtained by the interview. Differential Global Positioning System was used to record the location of each house and its drinking water source. PH of 50 open-well water samples was estimated. The prevalence of self-reported hypothyroidism was 4.24%. Maps depicting pH distribution and occurrence of hypothyroidism were prepared. Most of the areas had acidic ground water. Geo-statistical analysis revealed the occurrence of statistically significant clustering of hypothyroid individuals in areas having acidic ground water. The study brings out possible linkage between hypothyroidism and acidic water intake necessitating detailed epidemiological investigations for drawing more robust associations.","141":"The so-called protected tribal population are also facing burden of noncommunicable diseases. The high altitude tribes are thought to be genetically and environmentally protected from hypertension (HTN) like diseases. The objective is to estimate the prevalence of HTN among tribes residing at high altitudes (&gt;6000 feet above sea level) of India. The meta-analysis was undertaken during March to August 2018. National Library of Medicine's PubMed database, and Google scholar were comprehensively searched including search terms such as \"blood pressure, hypertension and prevalence\" combined with \"tribal, tribes, high altitude, India.\" Articles on the prevalence of HTN were searched first and then were segregated on the basis of high altitude (&gt;6000 ft). Initially, 69 references and a total of 16 abstracts were screened. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria on 16, eight studies were included. Meta-analysis of the prevalence of selected studies resulted in a pooled estimate mean prevalence of HTN among tribal population to be 11.43% (95% confidence interval: 6.72%-17.21%). The role of epidemiological transition needs to be read in the context of social anthropology to identify factors preventing HTN among high altitude tribes. ","142":"Infant and child feeding practices are a prevalent challenge in Haryana. The present study aimed to determine factors associated with non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and no continued breastfeeding in Haryana. National Family Health Survey-4 data for the state of Haryana was used for analysis. The outcomes were non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no EBF, and no continued breastfeeding. Independent variables were categorized as sociodemographic, maternal, and child level factors. Each category of factors was added step-by-step to the logistic regression model for multivariable analysis. Delayed initiation of breastfeeding was higher among poorer wealth quintiles. Home deliveries (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]-1.27-2.84), cesarean section (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI-1.46-3.40), body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg\/m2 (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI-1.13-2.33), and not receiving postnatal check-up (AOR 1.36, 95% CI-1.40-1.78) increases likelihood of delayed initiation of breastfeeding beyond 1 h of birth. Increased risk of non-EBF was associated with no postnatal check-ups and BMI &gt;25 kg\/m2. Risk of discontinuation of breastfeeding was significantly high with birth interval of &lt;2 years (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI-1.08-2.14) and if babies did not receive postnatal check-up (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI-1.04-2.27). The study highlighted need for focused approach to counsel overweight\/obese mothers, cesarean section, and home delivered mothers. Community awareness, adequate birth spacing, and postnatal visits are vital for improving exclusive and continued breastfeeding practices. Communities and health-care providers should provide adequate support to mothers for breastfeeding during the antenatal and postnatal periods.

A mixed-methods study was conducted during July 2017-March 2018. Data were collected through desk review, field visits, in-depth interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and focused group discussions (FGDs). A total of 24 variables were identified by the experts to review the training curricula. Seven states, 28 institutes, and 42 health-care facilities were visited. A total of 516 staff from different health cadres participated in the study through 54 interviews, 156 self-administered questionnaires, and 24 FGDs. Of 24 patient safety variables considered, 16 were covered in the medical and nursing, 9 in laboratory technician and pharmacist, and 5 in midwives' curricula. The teaching material on the patient safety, for most categories of staff, was not available in consolidated form, and there was no standardization. There is a need for the development of comprehensive training material cum operational modules on patient safety, suitably adopted as per the learning needs of different subgroups of health staff. The need for strengthening patient safety has been further underscored as the health workforce is fighting the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The initiatives on patient safety will contribute to improved overall quality of health services, which in turn would advance universal health coverage.

There are very few community-based studies on malnutrition among the elderly, especially in India. The objective was to find out the prevalence of malnutrition and its associated risk factors among the elderly in urbanized villages of Delhi. A cross-sectional study was conducted during November 2015 to April 2017 in two urbanized villages of East Delhi among 353 elderly (&gt;60 years) individuals. A semi-structured interview schedule was used to record the sociodemographic and relevant personal details of the elderly. To determine the prevalence of malnutrition, Mini Nutritional Assessment scale was used. Statistical analysis included simple descriptive analysis and tests of significance such as Chi-square test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of malnutrition. The prevalence of possible malnutrition was found to be 49.3%. On bivariate analysis, age, gender, education status, marital and residential status, per capita income, financial dependency, and family size were found to be associated with malnutrition (P &lt; 0.05). Age &gt;70 years, being tenant, and financial dependency were observed to be significant predictors of possible malnutrition in multiple logistic regression. Malnutrition needs to be identified at an early stage using appropriate tools so that proper interventions can be directed to those who need it to ensure healthy aging. Social and economic parameters are linked with the occurrence of malnutrition among the elderly and must be considered in the development of preventive strategies.

To examine the factors associated with inequality in undernutrition between Paniya and Kurichiya tribal communities in Wayanad district of Kerala. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted during August to October 2018 among 314 children aged 2-5 years belonging to Paniya (151) and Kurichiya (163) communities. Participants were selected using multistage cluster sampling. Data were collected using structured interview schedule based on household food insecurity access scale; relevant individual, parental, and household factors were ascertained; child nutritional status was assessed based on anthropometric measurements. The composite index of anthropometric failure (CIAF) was used as an aggregate indicator of undernutrition. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test and univariate and multivariable logistic regression. There were significant differences in the prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting between Paniya (52.3%, 58.9%, and 25.2%, respectively) and Kurichiya (28.2%, 31.1%, and 12.3%, respectively) tribal children. Based on the CIAF, 66.9% and 41.1% of Paniya and Kurichiya children, respectively, were undernourished. Intratribal difference was observed to exist in all three forms of anthropometric failures simultaneously. Significant factors associated with CIAF were community identity, household food insecurity, and maternal early marriage. Significant factor associated with all three forms of undernutrition was maternal experience of domestic violence. This study demonstrates the child nutritional inequality within the tribal communities and indicates the need for more focused policies and programs among vulnerable tribal groups to ensure food security and empowerment of women.

The aim of this study is to determine the out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrhoeal illness among the under-five children in in-patient and out-patient cases. A cross-sectional study was conducted during January-April 2018 among 60 under-five children with diarrheal illness reporting to pediatric outpatient department (OPD) and 60 under-five children admitted to pediatric ward of a tertiary care teaching hospital. For determining the out-of-pocket health expenditure, both direct and indirect costs for the management of diarrheal illness were estimated both for out-patient and in-patient cases. The cost of the treatment has been presented as the cost of prehospital visits, during a hospital visit and posthospital visit. Overall, median out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrheal illness for out-patient and in-patient cases were Rs. 1186 (interquartile range [IQR]: Rs. 510) and Rs. 6385 (IQR: Rs. 5889), respectively. The median direct expenditure for OPD cases was Rs. 778.50 (IQR: Rs. 263) and indirect expenditure for OPD cases were Rs. 407.50 (IQR: Rs. 336) The median direct and indirect expenditure for inpatient cases were Rs. 3823 (IQR: Rs. 1942) and Rs. 2237 (IQR: Rs. 4256) respectively. Only 13% of in-patient cases had some kind of medical insurance. A considerable economic burden is faced by the families for treating diarrhea in under-five children. Improved access to safe drinking water and sanitation, promotion of hand hygiene, exclusive breastfeeding, rotavirus vaccination, and use of oral rehydration therapy will reduce hospitalization and out-of-pocket expenditure.

This can be improved by increasing awareness of foodstuffs that are rich in iron and ensuring their availability. The objective of the study was to assess the quality of information available on iron-rich foods and to assess their production and consumption in India. This was a review of common textbooks for medical, nursing, and home science students; related policy and program documents; and government publications on production and consumption of various foodstuffs in India. Details of specific foods that are rich in iron have not been provided. Instead, food groups such as pulses, cereals, nuts, and green leafy vegetables (GLVs) have been mentioned that are good sources of non-heme iron. This is in spite of the fact that all the foodstuffs in these groups are not uniformly iron rich. Among cereals and pulses, rice and red gram dal (arhar) are the most commonly produced and consumed, though they have the lowest iron content. Spinach and mustard leaves believed to be iron rich and commonly consumed are among those GLVs having lowest iron content. Details of 5-10 foodstuffs which have the highest iron content within each food group should be available in relevant books and documents meant for education, production, and consumption data.

This not only undermines the effectiveness of PHP but also undermines the credibility of public health as a specialty. Jim Collin's five levels of leadership are useful to understand the various levels of leadership for a PHP. Technical excellence which denotes first level of leadership is necessary but not sufficient to become a leader. One needs team work, emotional competencies, prioritization ( first things first), listening skills, advocacy, negotiation, networking skills, along with conviction, commitment, and courage to do what one thinks is right.

Existing weekly reporting of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) was modified to report 17 diseases or events from 22 public hospitals and three private hospitals in Ujjain. Water samples were also tested for fecal contamination in areas reporting diarrhea. We identified 56,600 ill persons (92% from government hospitals and 8% from private hospitals): 33% had fever, 28% acute respiratory infection, and 26% acute diarrheal diseases. There were 15 deaths (12 injury and 3 drowning). We detected two diarrhea outbreaks (Mahakaal Zone with 9 cases and Dutta Akhara Zone with 42 cases). Among 26 water samples, eight showed fecal contamination. This was a large implementation of daily disease surveillance in a religious mass gathering in India by IDSP. We recommended laboratory confirmation for diseases and similar daily surveillance in future mass gatherings in India.","159":"Built environment characteristics in the neighborhood are of utmost priority for a healthy lifestyle in the fast-urbanizing countries. These characteristics are closely linked to the disease burden and challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which have been unexplored using open-source data. The present technology offers online resources and open source software that enable researchers to explore built environment characteristics with health and allied phenomena. This article intends to delineate methods to capture available and accessible objective built environment variables for a state in India and determine their distribution across the state. Built environment variables such as population density and residential density were collated from the Census of India. Safety from crime and traffic were captured as crime rates and pedestrian accident rates, respectively, acquired from State Crime Records Bureau. Greenness, built-up density, and land slope were gathered from open-source satellite imagery repository. Road intersection density was derived from OpenStreetMap. Processing and analysis differed for each dataset depending on its source and nature. Each variable showed a distinct pattern across the state. Population and residential density were found to be closely related to each other across both districts and subdistricts. They were both positively related to crime rates, pedestrian accident rates, built-up density, and intersection density, whereas negatively related to land slope and greenness across the subdistricts. Delineating the distribution of built environment variables using available and open-source data in resource-poor settings is a first in public health research among LMICs. Cost-effectiveness and reproducible nature of open-source solutions could equip researchers in resource-poor settings to identify built environment characteristics and patterns across regions. ","160":"Alcohol increases risk of cancer of oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, colorectal, liver, larynx, and female breast. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of alcohol and cancer in India by meta-analysis. Systematic Medline searches were performed to identify all the published literature associating alcohol and cancer in India. Initially, we retrieved 1509 studies, but after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 29 studies were found eligible for our meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis shows that alcohol consumption increases the risk of cancer with the odds ratio (OR) of 2.32 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-3.47) in case-control studies and relative risk of 1.52 (95% CI: 0.97-2.51) in cohort studies. It also shows that risk of oral cavity cancer increases by two times (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.54-3.96) in the population consuming alcohol. Publication analysis showed that studies included in the meta-analysis had wide variation, suggesting good representation all over the country. The result from our meta-analysis supports our hypothesis that alcohol consumption increases the risk of cancer, implying immediate cessation of the habit for cancer risk reduction. ","161":"Unplanned pregnancies are a major public health concern. In India, 33% of an estimated 48.1 million pregnancies end in induced abortions. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) can prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse, have been part of India's family planning program since 2002-2003 and are available as over-the-counter drugs. While there are concerns about the overuse of ECPs, the pattern of use of ECPs in India is unknown. The objective is to determine the proportion of women who have ever used ECPs and repeatedly used ECPs and also to assess the reasons for use and nonuse of EC pills along with factors associated with the use. A systematic review of ECP use in India was conducted by electronically searching three databases-PubMed, Popline, and Google Scholar. All studies were published between 2001 and 2017, and the electronic search was last conducted in July 2018. The proportion of use was calculated using meta-analysis, and the other factors were assessed by narratively synthesizing the findings. Thirty-three articles met the inclusion criteria. The pooled proportion of women who ever used ECPs was 6% (95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.10). The proportion of repeat use ranged from 12% to 69%. Five studies reported reasons for not using ECPs, and the most common reasons were religious\/cultural beliefs followed by fear of side effects and inadequate knowledge. Studies to understand sociodemographic and other factors affecting the use of ECPs in India are lacking. There are significant concerns about the quality of the studies. The definition of repeat use of ECPs is inconsistent across papers. Furthermore, judgmental attitudes of health-care providers were apparent in some papers. The review highlights important research and program gaps. ","162":"In India, the measles-rubella (MR) vaccination campaign was conducted with the purpose of vaccinating all children of 9 months-15 years of age with a single dose of MR vaccine. However, it encountered various challenges which may hamper with the coverage. This study was conducted to evaluate the recently conducted MR campaign in Manipur pertaining to its coverage and factors for not vaccinating. The cross-sectional study was conducted in Imphal East district of Manipur during May and June 2018 among 1551 children from two communities. The study tool was adapted from the rapid convenience monitoring tool of the WHO. Descriptive statistics were generated, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed with vaccination status as dependent with selected independent variables. Among the study children, 38% were in the age group of 5-10 years, males constituting 51.3%. Only two-third (68.8%) of the children had received the MR vaccine, coverage among Muslim children was 40.4% only, and 6.5% of the respondents reported some forms of adverse events following immunization. Children from the Meitei community were (odds ratio: 14.35, 95% confidence interval: 10.22-20.16) significantly more likely to receive the MR vaccination as compared to children belonging to the Muslim community (P = 0.001). Vaccination coverage of only 68.8% highlighted the need for increased sensitization and involvement of local and religious leaders in generating necessary awareness for improved coverage of the campaign. ","163":"Postpartum anemia is associated with postpartum anxiety, depression, poor cognitive interaction, and delayed infant development. Oral iron is the currently recommended therapy but is associated with gastrointestinal complaints and poor compliance. Parenteral iron dextran may cause serious side effects, whereas iron sucrose requires repeated visits. Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is given as an infusion in a single setting, which is logistically convenient both to patients and health system. It can be particularly beneficial for postpartum women who are usually discharged from health facility 48 h after delivery. The objectives of this study were to estimate the change in mean hemoglobin (Hb) level 6 weeks after administration of intravenous FCM and to document any adverse events following administration among postpartum women. A prospective, interventional follow-up study was conducted from August to December 2018. One hundred eligible postpartum women with Hb level of 5-9.9 g\/dl were administered a calculated dose of intravenous FCM based on Ganzoni's formula with Hb target of 12 g\/dl. Hb and serum ferritin were measured at baseline and at 6 weeks after FCM infusion and compared for mean increase. There was a significant increase in Hb and serum ferritin levels after administration of FCM. The mean (95% confidence interval) increase in the Hb and serum ferritin after 6 weeks was 4.2 (3.9-4.5) g\/dl and 137.3 (113.6-161.0) ng\/ml, respectively. No major adverse events were reported. Administration of FCM was safe and effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe anemia among postpartum women. ","164":"Nutrition epidemiology initially focused on few nutrients thought to be responsible for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The database of Indian Nutrition Survey is based majorly on calorie intake. The objective was to compare the change in the average calorie intake from 1990 to 2012 with the emerging epidemic of diabetes and hypertension (HTN) in India since 1990. A comprehensive search was made in National Library of Medicine's PubMed database and Google Scholar from March to August 2018, on the above-mentioned subjects. Reports of national surveys (National Sample Survey Office and National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau) were included for average calorie intake among different states from year 1990 onward. Region-wise search depicted by national nutrition surveys resulted in 277 and 587 abstracts on the prevalence of HTN and diabetes mellitus, respectively. There were 51 full-text articles and abstracts on the prevalence of HTN and diabetes from the above regions. The average calorie intake per capita per day in the four zones of country in rural areas decreased from 1990 to 2012. An increasing trend in the prevalence of diabetes from rural areas was observed from 1994 to 2012. The per capita average calorie intake per day in urban areas from 1999 through 2011 in all zones except the eastern part of country was on rise. There was no consistent trend in the prevalence of HTN in any of the zones. It is not just an increase in calories, but a trade-off between the demand for calories and the demand for healthy lifestyles determines the prevalence of NCDs.

The objective of the study was to explore health-care professionals' knowledge base and characteristics on the utilization of the frequency, intensity, time (duration), and type principle (FITT) of PA as an MD prevention program in the Ethiopian public health-care system. A mixed-method research design was used with data collected from 13 public referral hospitals in Ethiopia. In Phase I, quantitative data were collected from 312 health professionals (99 physicians and 213 nurses) using a survey. In Phase II, qualitative data were collected by interviewing health officers (n = 13 physician-hospital managers) and conducting one focus group discussion (n = 6 national health bureau officers). A quarter (28%) of practitioners working in referral hospitals are using PA as an MD prevention program.

Thus, the disparities in coverage of MCH services need to be assessed and addressed. The objective of this study was to examine the variation in coverage rates for a key set of interventions in MCH services and to assess the relationship between coverage gap and socioeconomic development across the districts of Jammu and Kashmir. Data from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4), 2015-2016, Census of India 2011, and Digest of Statistics Jammu and Kashmir were used to construct two composite indexes of coverage gap and socioeconomic development at district level. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the internal consistency of indicators used in the two indexes. The overall coverage gap in the state was 28.17%, and the size of coverage gap was largest for family planning interventions (55.8%), followed by treatment of sick children (26.95%) and maternal and newborn care (18.75%), and was smallest for immunization (10.5%). There is a moderate negative correlation between coverage gap and socioeconomic development (r = -0.63, P = 0.01). Coverage of MCH services and socioeconomic development has a significant disparity in the districts of Jammu and Kashmir. Resource-rich and more urbanized districts are much ahead of the poor and less urbanized districts in terms of the usage of MCH services. ","170":"Although air pollution and weather changes have been identified as putative risk factors that precipitate acute attacks of bronchial asthma, so far there have been no studies that could conclusively establisha clear association. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of the concentrations of NO2, SO2, and particulate matter on exacerbation of bronchial asthma. A longitudinal study was conducted during February 2014-January 2015. Sixty-one known cases of asthma were recruited from the outpatient department of a chest hospital. Data regarding weather parameter (temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity) and environmental pollution (SO2and NO2) and respirable suspended particulate matter were procured from the Indian Meteorological Department and Delhi Pollution Control Committee, respectively. Association was examined using the generalized estimation equation (GEE). Separate models were developed for weather parameter and pollution parameters. This study could not find a significant association between any of the weather parameters and occurrence of asthmatic attacks. In the GEE model, where average values of SO2, NO2, and PM were used, the PM was found to be significantly associated with asthmatic attacks. PM was found to increase the risk of exacerbation of asthma three folds. ","171":"Successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) mainly depends on sustaining high rates of adherence. In the context of Indonesia, none of the previous studies have looked at determinants of HIV adherence among transgender populations. This study aimed to explore factors associated with the adherence to ART among HIV-positive transgender women in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Face-to-face in-depth interviews with 29 transgender women, also known as Waria, living with HIV were conducted from December 2017 to February 2018. Participants were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Data were analyzed thematically using a qualitative data analysis framework. Factors associated with ART adherence among transgender participants were divided into three major levels as follows: (i) individual factors, (ii) social factors, and (iii) structural factors. Feeling tired and lazy due to work, falling asleep before taking medicine, schedule to take the medicine, healthy physical condition of other HIV-positive friends who did not take antiretrovirals, and the lack of finances to travel to health facilities were the influencers of the participants' ART adherence. These findings indicate the need for the development of HIV\/AIDS-related health service supporting system in health-care facilities and the dissemination of knowledge and information of HIV\/AIDS and its related service for HIV-positive transgender women and other people living with HIV and general populations in other parts of the country and other similar settings globally. ","172":"The geriatric depression scale - short form (GDS-SF) considered an important preliminary screening tool, requires translation in different regional languages and validation, to become of utmost use in Indian context especially in the field level. The current study aimed to evaluate the psychometric validity of the GDS-SF translated into Bengali among rural elderly population. The 15-item GDS-SF translated to Bengali language was administered to 206 Bengali speaking geriatrics selected maintaining predecided inclusion and exclusion criteria from villages under a rural block in West Bengal. Latent trait modelling was used to evaluate the psychometric properties of this translated tool. Differential item functioning (DIF) was assessed to measure invariance. The mean age of the participants was 68.77 years (standard deviation 6.81 years). Majority being female (57.77%), Hindu (87.38%), from a joint family background (90.78%). The highest discrimination was observed with item 8 (coefficient 3.682, P &lt; 0.001) followed by item 14 (coefficient 3.020, P &lt; 0.001). Question 2 had least coefficient for difficulty (-1.344, P = 0.013) while item 15 had highest (0.775, P = 0.001). The questionnaire provided maximum information (discrimination) around mean value of latent trait. The total cutoff score of 5 was related nearly to mean latent trait (-0.111). Items 10 and 13 showed consistent DIF across different demographic groups. Psychometric properties of GDS-SF (Bengali) established overall construct and content validity of the tool in this community-based study.

While on the one hand, the government has to struggle with the strategies for control of COVID-19, on the other hand, other routine health services also need to be managed. Second, the infrastructure needs to be augmented to meet the potential epidemic surge of cases. Third, economic welfare and household income need to be guaranteed. All of these have complicated the routine ways in which the governments have dealt with various trade-offs to determine the health and public policies. In this paper, we outline key economic principles for the government to consider for policymaking, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic rightfully places long due attention of policymakers for investing in health sector. The policy entrepreneurs and public health community should not miss this once-in-a-lifetime \"policy window\" to raise the level of advocacy for appropriate investment in health sector.","186":"The mHealth app Arogya Setu can substantially contribute to the containment and management of COVID-19.

To document COVID-19 coverage in Kannada daily newspapers, hardcopies of 455 editions were methodically reviewed. Content analysis and data coding of 11 of the possible 60 terms\/concepts related to COVID-19 epidemiology, was undertaken. Across dailies, five different dimensions in reporting documented: reporting of statistics - both numbers and manner of reporting, reporting of epidemiological concepts\/terms (frequency of use and frequency of reporting), focus of reporting, density of reporting and finally what is not reported which could have been reported (desirable reporting). Numbers were reported as headlines; &gt;25% of listed items were covered; however, 20% of terms not covered would have helped. We looked at \"News\" as epidemiological information and identified the gaps in reporting. We conclude that vernacular print media in Karnataka has done a commendable job.

The article outlines an assessment of health systems based on World Health Organization's building blocks for select countries. It also compares these with the findings from a more comprehensive analysis of Global Health Security (GHS) Index, which assesses the preparedness of the health system for such pandemics. The GHS report (2019) spelt out very objectively that none of the countries of the world was prepared to effectively handle such emergencies, should they arise. Observations emerging from different countries highlight these findings although some of them seem to be discordant. Overall, it appears that Asian countries could fight the battle better than most developed nations in the Europe and America during the current pandemic, despite having poor GHS scores. Experiences of these countries in facing similar crisis in the past probably sensitized their strained health systems for a greater good.

About half (50.8%) of the participants reported that their gaming behavior had increased, whereas 14.6% reported a decrease in their gaming during the lockdown period. In binary logistic regression analysis, hours of gaming per day (odds ratio [OR] 1.75 [1.29-2.36]), increase in gaming due to examination related stress (OR 4.96 [1.12-21.98]), and belief that gaming helps managing stress (OR 4.27 [1.65-11.04]), were found to be independently associated with gaming behavior during lockdown period. In the lockdown period following COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in gaming behavior was associated with examination-related stress and the belief that gaming helps combat stress. These observations highlight the need to focus on the coping style of the students to ascertain the likelihood of them engaging in gaming behavior as a coping mechanism against stress. ","198":"Mumbai is facing the full brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic epidemiologically and economically. The objective was to understand the spatial distribution and trends of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Mumbai during the lockdown period and draw insights for effective actions. Spatial and trend analysis was conducted to trace the spread of the virus during the lockdown period in April 2020. The administrative divisions of Mumbai, in the form of wards and zones, have been used as units of analysis. Greater Mumbai area occupies only 0.015% of the landmass of India, but is contributing to over 20% of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in India. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have increased over 375 times within 50 days of the lockdown. An analysis of trends across the wards during the 3-week period (April 4 to April 25) shows a skewed pattern, with three zones out of six contributing to the vast majority of cases in Mumbai. The wards with higher formal economic activity are relatively less affected than the other wards. The test positivity rate in Mumbai is much higher than the rest of India. The study suggests that the virus had already spread to the community in Mumbai before the lockdown started. ","199":"In the absence of any approved treatment or vaccine against novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) are the cornerstone to prevent the disease, especially in a populous country like India. To understand the effectiveness of NPIs reported in the contemporary literatures describing prediction models for prevention of the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 specifically in Indian population. Original research articles in English obtained through keyword search in PubMed, WHO Global Database for COVID19, and pre-print servers were included in the review. Thematic synthesis of extracted data from articles were done. Twenty-four articles were found eligible for the review - four published articles and twenty pre-print articles. Compartmental model was found to be the most commonly used mathematical model; along with exponential, time varying, neural network and cluster kinetic models. Social distancing, specifically lockdown, was the most commonly modelled intervention strategy. Additionally, contact tracing using smartphone application, international travel restriction, increasing hospital\/ICU beds, changes in testing strategy were also dealt with. Social distancing along with increasing testing seemed to be effective in delaying the peak of the epidemic and reducing the peak prevalence. Although there is mathematical rationality behind implementation of social distancing measures including lockdown, this study also emphasised the importance of other associated measures like increasing tests and increasing the number of hospital and ICU beds. The later components are particularly important during the social mixing period to be observed after lifting of lockdown. ","200":"The origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still a debatable topic. The association of the virus spread from the market is supported by the close relation of genome sequences of environmental surface samples with virus samples from earliest patients by phylogenetic analysis. To have an insight into the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences reported from India for better understanding on their epidemiology and virulence. Genome sequences of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand their phylogeny and divergence with respect to other isolates reported from other countries. Amino acid sequences of individual open reading frames (ORFs) from SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates were aligned with sequences of isolates reported from other countries to identify the mutations occurred in Indian isolates. Our analysis suggests that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates are closely related to isolates reported from other parts of the world. Most ORFs are highly conserved; mutations were also detected in some ORFs. We found that most isolates reported from India have key mutations at 614th position of the S protein and 84th position of the ORF 8, which has been reported to be associated with high virulence and high transmission rate. An attempt was made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus reported from India. SARS-CoV-2 reported from India was closely similar to other SARS-CoV-2 reported from other parts of the world, which suggests that vaccines and other therapeutic methods generated from other countries might work well in India. In addition, available sequence data suggest that majority of Indian isolates are capable of high transmission and virulence. ","201":"As of May 4, 2020, India has reported 42,836 confirmed cases and 1,389 deaths from COVID-19. India's multipronged response included nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) like intensive case-based surveillance, expanding testing capacity, social distancing, health promotion, and progressive travel restrictions leading to a complete halt of international and domestic movements (lockdown). We studied the impact of NPI on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India and estimated the minimum level of herd immunity required to halt it. We plotted time distribution, estimated basic (R0) and time-dependent effective (Rt) reproduction numbers using software R, and calculated doubling time, the growth rate for confirmed cases from January 30 to May 4, 2020. Herd immunity was estimated using the latest Rtvalue. Time distribution showed a propagated epidemic with subexponential growth. Average growth rate, 21% in the beginning, reduced to 6% after an extended lockdown (May 3). Based on early transmission dynamics, R0was 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.79-3.07). Early, unmitigated Rt= 2.51 (95% CI = 2.05-3.14) (March 15) reduced to 1.28 (95% CI = 1.22-1.32) and was 1.83 (95% CI = 1.71-1.93) at the end of lockdown Phase 1 (April 14) and 2 (May 3), respectively. Similarly, average early doubling time (4.3 days) (standard deviation [SD] = 1.86) increased to 5.4 days (SD = 1.03) and 10.9 days (SD = 2.19). Estimated minimum 621 million recoveries are required to halt COVID-19 spread if Rtremains below 2. India's early response, especially stringent lockdown, has slowed COVID-19 epidemic. Increased testing, intensive case-based surveillance and containment efforts, modulated movement restrictions while protecting the vulnerable population, and continuous monitoring of transmission dynamics should be a way forward in the absence of effective treatment, vaccine, and undetermined postinfection immunity. ","202":"The number of secondary cases from each primary case determines how fast an epidemic grows. It is known that all cases do not spread the infection equally; super spreaders play an important role as they contribute disproportionately to a much larger number of cases including in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Super spreaders have been reported for more than a century, but limited information is available in scientific literature. An epidemic containment strategy needs to include early identification of super spreaders to limit an explosive growth. Super spreaders tend to get stigmatized, resulting in late reporting and hiding of cases. It is important for program managers to be sensitive to the manner in which related information is shared with media and general public.","203":"Pandemics like COVID-19 warrant an urgent implementation of the one health surveillance (OHS) system to the focus on multisectoral, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, and multispecialty coordination, in all aspects of the response to outbreaks that might involve humans, animals, and their environment. The Indian system so far has evolved in conducting surveillance and monitoring of parameters within the domain of human health, animal health, and the environment, but in silos. This commentary piece provides an opinion to boost the existing surveillance activities for early detection and ways to develop an integrated OHS to prevent future COVID-19 like pandemics in India. It also attempts to provide possible solutions at the interface of human-animal-environment, from the simpler to the complex system integration with the principles of one health.","204":"Primary route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is droplets and direct contact. Airborne transmission of this virus is not established conclusively and so is the role of airborne particulate matter. This commentary examines the existing evidence about the role of particulate matter pollutants in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. PM2.5and other small particulate matter have been shown to carry viable virus particles in the air and incriminated in spread of measles and SARS coronavirus. Empirical evidence has been provided regarding role of air pollution in accelerated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy as well as Wuhan. Lockdown-related reduction in PM2.5levels in ambient air may have contributed to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. High PM2.5levels in the past might have added to SARS-CoV-2 related mortality due to air pollution relate comorbidities. Post-lockdown increase in PM2.5levels may accelerate covid-19 transmission and can add to the burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","205":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted (at the time of writing) in over 3.3 million cases and 233,000 deaths globally and ~33,000 cases and ~1,100 deaths in India. The mainstay of the diagnosis is a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The accurate diagnosis is contingent on appropriate specimen choice, time of collection, and assay employed. In this commentary, we highlight the role of laboratory diagnostic tests used in the different stages of India's COVID-19 pandemic response.","206":"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial has been proposed as possible treatment for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). India has approved the use of HCQ for prophylaxis of asymptomatic health workers treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, and asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued Emergency Use Authorization for the use of HCQ to treat COVID-19 in adolescents and adults. In this review, we go over the available evidence for and against HCQ's use as prophylaxis or treatment for COVID-19, especially in the Indian context.","207":"Digital health interventions are globally playing a significant role to combat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Here, we present a very brief overview of the multifaceted digital interventions, globally, and in India, for maintaining health and health-care delivery, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","208":"A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has become a global pandemic. Currently, the management of COVID-19 infection is mainly supportive. Several clinical trials worldwide are evaluating several drugs approved for other indications, as well as multiple investigational agents for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we give a brief overview of pharmacological agents and other therapies which are under investigation as treatment options or adjunctive agents for patients infected with COVID-19 and for chemoprophylaxis for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. At the time of writing this commentary, there is no peer-reviewed published evidence from randomized clinical trials of any pharmacological agents improving outcomes in COVID-19 patients. However, it was reported that remdesivir an investigational antiviral agent hastens clinical recovery, but a study is yet to be published in peer-reviewed medical journal.","209":"The whole globe is reeling under the COVID-19 pandemic now. With the scale and severity of infection, number of deaths and lack of any definite therapeutic armamentarium, the vaccine development has been accelerated at a never-before pace. A wide variety of vaccine technologies and platforms are being attempted. Out of the over 108 efforts, 100 are in preclinical and eight in Phase 1 or 2 trial stage. While the availability of newer technologies has facilitated development, there are several challenges on the way including limited understanding of the pathophysiology, targeting humoral or mucosal immunity, lack of suitable animal model, poor success of human severe acute respiratory syndrome\/Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines, limited efficacy of influenza vaccines, and immune exaggeration with animal coronavirus vaccines. With the current scenario with political, funding, research, and regulatory supports, if everything sails through smoothly, the successful vaccine is expected in 12-18 months. Modestly efficacious vaccine may be also a good achievement.","210":"There is a lot of discussion on COVID-19 control strategies from the mainstream approaches, but it is also necessary to examine the contributions of the Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Riga and Homeopathy (AYUSH) sector, which is now being brought into public health interventions nationally. Although the AYUSH sector had previously joined the management of dengue and chikungunya outbreaks in some Indian states, its participation has remained contentious and there is reluctance in mainstream public health discourses to seriously examine their interventions. This is a commentary on the efforts made by the Ministry of AYUSH, state AYUSH directorates, AYUSH research institutions, and public hospitals, based on official documents as well as official statements reported in the media, with the aim of bringing out concerns in the process of adapting traditional textual knowledge and practices to public health requirements of the current age.","211":"At the end of April 2020, there had already been three million cases of COVID-19 in the world pandemic. Chhattisgarh might expect 90,000 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the end. The first step taken in March was to ensure a simple checklist of activities that needed to continue. Handbills were given with the basic information on the symptoms and what to do in the community. In urban areas, the lockdown affected the poorer section of the society, especially who are not having BPL card and no other means of availing necessary eatables. Issues that arose affecting regular activities such as tuberculosis and immunization. Residents of informal settlements are also vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Frontline workers such as Mitanins in the community are an important asset in the capacity building and preparedness strategies.","212":"The response of Kerala state to COVID-19, led by the health department, was nested in larger social mobilization. Kerala has developed a strong government health system. Learning from managing the Nipah outbreaks, Kerala took effective prevention measures early. Local governments, actively involved in public health in Kerala, played an active role in controlling the epidemic and in cushioning the impact on the poor. Transparency in information and willingness of the government to take the people into confidence has contributed to enhancing trust in the government. These strengths will stand Kerala in good stead as it prepares to manage the next wave of COVID-19 infections.","213":"This commentary reviews the health systems preparedness during the COVID-19 epidemic in China and India. It provides insight into how nonmedical measures were employed to contain and control the epidemic in Wuhan which was the epicenter. The methods employed by the Chinese provided the roadmap for the countries as the epidemic became pandemic. It provides contrasts in health system preparedness between China and India.","214":"The Indian Armed Forces have always responded to the Nation's call and the COVID-19 pandemic response has been no different. On instructions from the Government of India, the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) pitched in right from the initial stages of the epidemic in India as part of a coordinated national response. Be it the execution of medical quarantine for Indian citizens evacuated from China and other COVID affected countries or establishing dedicated and mixed COVID hospitals for its own clientele as well as civilian patients, the AFMS worked in tandem with the national policies. The Armed Forces ensured force preservation and protection of its own troops and families by timely implementation of public health measures, even as it played its designated role in the national strategy. With vision, understanding and clarity, the AFMS continue to lend shoulder to India's response to this global public health challenge.","215":"Some nations in the world and some states in India have had more success in containing this pandemic. Recent efforts in strengthening the health sector have focused largely on reforms in modes of financing, but as the pandemic brings home to us, the main challenge in India remains the challenge of the organization of public services using a health systems understanding. A close to community comprehensive primary health care, quality assurance, and planned excess capacity in public health systems, a more robust disease surveillance systems that can integrate data on new outbreaks and the indigenous technological capacity to scale up innovation and manufacture of essential health commodities are some of our most important requirements for both epidemic preparedness and response.","216":"The COVID-19 pandemic behaves like many other viruses spread through respiratory routes. This is generally a mild disease for those aged less than 50 years.

The qualitative study was conducted in 2019 with the objective to explore the motivating factors for adherence to ART treatment among TG people living with HIV (PLHIV) in an ART center. Respondents were motivated PLHIVs on ART with suitable treatment adherence recorded. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence. Five themes emerged with prime acknowledgment of respondents that ART medication is lifelong for their survival with receiving support.

The objective of this study was to assess whether the inclusion of informed consent affects the HIV positivity rate among the participants and nonparticipants injecting drug users (IDU) in HSS 2017 in four states of Central Zone of India. This study was a cross-sectional study. All sentinel sites from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Uttarakhand located at targeted intervention facilities in 2017 were included in the study. Information about the participation and nonparticipation of each high-risk individual at the sentinel site was gathered from the master list, respective registers, and website portal of the National AIDS Control Organization. A total of 8639 individuals were included in the analysis. Overall, 16 sites in four states were included in the study. Overall, the nonparticipation rate of IDUs was 14.3%; highest being for Delhi (17.2%), followed by Uttar Pradesh (14.6%), Uttarakhand (10.9%), and Jharkhand (4.4%). Overall, the HIV-positivity rate among nonparticipants (9.6%) was significantly higher (P = 0.009) compared to the participants (6.7%). Change in methodology and seeking written informed consent might have an effect on the nonparticipation in all four states. This, in turn, could have led to the underestimation of HIV-positivity rates among IDU in the states. ","224":"The proximity of Northeast India to the Golden Triangle facilitates easy accessibility to illicit drugs, resulting in a higher proportion of injecting drug users (IDUs) in the states of Northeast India. The estimated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence among IDU in Manipur which is 1.43% is higher than that of the national figure. The objectives of the study were to find the factors associated with HIV infection and correlate the association between HIV status and self-assessed risk to HIV among IDUs in Manipur. National Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance (2014-2015) data were used for the study; all analyses done were weighted. In Manipur, information was collected from 1594 IDUs during the surveillance between 2014 and 2015 across four domains, namely Chandel (396), Imphal East (397), Thoubal (401), and Senapati (400). Chi-square test was performed to test the association between the independent and dependent variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with HIV positivity. Higher age, unsafe injecting practice, low education status, and low-income status were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) associated with HIV infection among IDUs in Manipur. Self-assessed risk of HIV infection by IDU was significantly associated with HIV positivity. Interventions among IDUs in Manipur should focus on emphasizing safe injecting practices along with creating awareness on HIV prevention and management. ","225":"Hijra or transgender (H\/TG) people are significantly affected by HIV in India. HIV prevalence among H\/TG is the second highest after people who inject drugs. Effective interventions require understanding about various risk behaviors and associated factors for high prevalence. This study analyzes the known risk behaviors and vulnerabilities of HIV-positive and HIV-negative H\/TG people to identify the determinants of HIV seropositivity in this high-risk group. Using secondary data from India's 2014 to 2015 Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance survey, this analysis was conducted among 3325 H\/TG people across seven states. Probability-based sampling methods were used to recruit H\/TG people. Informed consent was obtained for the collection of behavioral information and blood samples for HIV testing. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was undertaken to identify the determinants of HIV seropositivity. HIV prevalence for this group of respondents was 9.5%. Multivariable analysis of survey data revealed higher odds of HIV infection if H\/TG had regular male partners (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.81, confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-3.06), were living in the states of Maharashtra (AOR: 6.08, CI: 3.02-12.22) and Odisha (AOR: 2.91, CI: 1.05-8.06), and were members of self-help groups (AOR: 2.08, CI: 1.04-4.14). None of the demographic or behavioral correlates of risk were found to be associated with HIV infection. The findings suggest that community and structural factors, which are inadequately covered in surveys such as IBBS, play a more important role than individual behavioral factors. ","226":"Female sex workers (FSWs) have been identified as an important target group for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\/sexually transmitted infections prevention. This study aimed to describe sociodemographic and sex work characteristics and to identify the risk factors for HIV infection with special focus on the variations between home-based (HB) and non-HB (NHB) FSWs in three high-prevalent North-Eastern states of India: Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Data from the National Integrated Bio-Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS) conducted in India during 2014-2015 were utilized in the study. IBBS is a quantitative survey conducted among identified high risk sub within India. Logistic regression analyses were performed using SAS 9.3.2 to determine the distribution and associations of sociodemographics and risk behaviors with HIV seropositivity of HB and NHB FSWs. HIV prevalence was found higher among NHB FSWs compared to HB FSW (7.3% vs. 4.6%). The proportions of FSW among HB (66.7%) were in sex work for longer duration are significantly higher than for NHB (60.2%) while risk of HIV infection due to injecting drug use was higher in NHB FSW (11.7% vs. 8.7%). Reference to FSW who were currently married, those who were widowed\/divorced\/separated had 2.73-fold risk of HIV. FSW who did not have any other income source were associated with 1.73 times more risk of HIV infection. Injecting drugs user among FSW respondents had four times higher likelihood to be HIV positive. A substantial proportion of NHB FSWs is mobile in nature. Targeted interventions are required urgently to minimize HIV risk among those FSWs especially the widowed\/divorced\/separated, sex work is only income source and who used injecting drugs for nonmedical purpose. ","227":"Targeted interventions (TIs) are one of the most effective strategies to control HIV\/AIDS transmission, especially among the high-risk groups (HRGs). Implementation of HIV\/AIDS control strategies relies heavily on estimation of the size of HRG population. Size estimation for key populations such as female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and injecting drug users (IDUs) is a crucial component of national HIV strategic planning. The objective of this study was to estimate the size of FSWs, MSM, and IDUs in various states of India. The program multiplier method was used to estimate the size of FSWs, MSM, and IDUs across the country using two distinct but overlapping data sources - Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance and TI program from the same geographical area at the same time period. In India, as on 2018-2019, there were nearly 18.2 lakhs estimated FSWs accounting to 0.53% among female population aged 15-49 years, with a highest in West Bengal (4.5 lakhs); 5.7 lakhs estimated MSM accounting to 0.16% among male population aged 15-49 years, with a highest in Gujarat (0.7 lakh); and 3.9 lakhs estimated IDUs accounting to 0.11% among male population aged 15-49 years, with a highest in Uttar Pradesh (0.5 lakh). The current size estimates on HRGs will support the development of projections and estimations of the HIV epidemic at national and state levels. These estimates also help in framing national guidelines such as HIV strategic planning, program design, allocation of resources, prioritizing the interventions, and monitoring and evaluation. ","228":"The mobilization of resources to prevent and treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is unparalleled in the history of public health. The uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been rapid and unprecedented and made possible by the availability of funding - external and domestic. To justify continuous funding of ART in resource-scarce settings, a spate of cost-effectiveness studies has been undertaken in a number of countries. This paper is based on a systematic review of global studies on cost-effectiveness analysis of ART. The major objective was to review the existing literature on cost-effectiveness of ART to determine whether ART has been cost-effective (CE) in different settings. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles published between 2008 and 2017. We included studies that measured costs as well as effectiveness of HIV treatment - specifically ART - using incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as one of the outcomes. We identified 15 studies that met the search criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. The review confirms that ART programs have been CE across different settings, contexts, and strategies. The review would be useful for countries that are straining to raise funds for the health sector, generally, and for AIDS prevention and control program, specifically. This would also be beneficial for carrying out similar studies, if necessary, and as an advocacy tool for garnering additional funding. ","229":"HIV\/AIDS is a global public health issue and its transmission in a defined geographic region is influenced by the interplay of sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Better understanding of sociodemographic characteristics of HIV-positive individuals is required to prevent the spread of HIV among the general population. The objective of the study was to find the association between HIV prevalence and sociodemographic characteristics of pregnant women aged 15-49 years attending the antenatal clinics (ANCs) in six Southern states of India. The data from the latest round of HIV sentinel surveillance, a cross-sectional study, conducted during January-March 2017 among ANC attendees were considered for this analysis. Blood samples along with other relevant information were collected from 98,634 pregnant women from 248 sites across the states. The association between HIV prevalence and sociodemographic variables was examined using multivariable logistic regression. The highest HIV prevalence was reported in Karnataka (0.38%) and Andhra Pradesh (0.38%), followed by Telangana (0.33%), Odisha (0.28%), Tamil Nadu (0.27%), and Kerala (0.05%). In all states, the prevalence was highest among illiterate pregnant women exception being Kerala, wherein the prevalence was highest in pregnant women with schooling up to primary education. A significant association was found between HIV prevalence and spouse occupation in Karnataka and Odisha and spouse migration in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Need for improvising the interventions for the young, illiterates, having a migrant spouse, and spouse occupation as truckers\/hotel staff is recommended to the stakeholders involved in HIV management of the six southern states of India. ","230":"During round 2017 of HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) for men who have sex with men (MSM) in India, sampling strategy was changed from consecutive sampling to random sampling, and recruitment was conditioned on informed written consent. The study aimed to explore whether inclusion of informed consent is associated with HIV seropositivity rates among MSM population in select four states of Central India. The cross-sectional study was conducted in four states of Delhi, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand that were supervised by All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. We did analysis of data collected during 2017 HSS, supplemented with additional program data from targeted intervention (TI) sites. All nine MSM sites in four states were included. Participants were defined as all those MSM who participated in HSS 2017 irrespective of whether they were mentioned in the random list or were selected by the TI partner. The MSM in the random list who either refused to participate or could not be contacted even after three attempts were classified as \"nonparticipants.\" Seropositivity of both groups was compared. Descriptive statistics were derived. Overall nonparticipation rate was 14.7%, the highest being in Jharkhand (26%) and lowest in Uttarakhand (6.8%). Overall HIV positivity rate was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) in nonparticipants (4.2%) when compared to participants (1.42%). The change in sampling strategy and introduction of written informed consent for recruitment of high-risk groups in HSS 2017 round could have led to an underestimation of HIV seropositivity rate among MSM in the states in Central Zone.

The objective is to estimate the prevalence of HIV and identifies its sociodemographic correlates among a representative population of LDTs in West Bengal, India. Between May and July 2017, HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) was conducted in West Bengal by the National AIDS Control Organization. A total of 749 LDTs were recruited for the study, were interviewed, and tested for HIV. Descriptive and logistic regression analysis of socio-demographics, sexual risk behavior, and HIV serostatus were performed using SAS 9.3.2. The prevalence of HIV among LDT was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4-2.0). Mean age was 32.8 years (standard deviation 8.5), 77.1% were currently married, 89.9% were literate, 85.7% visited HSS site for collecting condoms or seeking medical care and treatment, 53.1% were rural residents, 86.7% had sex at least once with a female partner other than wife in the past 6 months, 2.7% had sex with a male partner and 1.7% injected drugs for recreational purpose. Higher age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1 [95% CI = 1.0-1.1]), literate (OR = 0.3 [95% CI = 0.1-0.9]), visiting HSS sites for collecting condoms or seeking medical care and treatment (adjusted OR [AOR] = 0.2 [95% CI = 0.1-0.6]), rural residence (OR = 0.2 [95% CI = 0.1-0.3]) and duration of stay in home (AOR = 1.3 [95% CI = 1.1-1.5]) were found to be significant predictors of having sex with a female partner other than wife. High HIV burden calls for urgency in the implementation of targeted intervention to minimize HIV risk among LDTs in West Bengal to fight against HIV\/AIDS. ","233":"Quality of HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) depends on preparedness of the site and adherence to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for HSS. A designated sentinel site is considered prepared for the round of sentinel surveillance based on the availability of infrastructure, human resource, and consumables. The study objectives were to describe the site level preparedness and adherence to SOP of antenatal care clinic (ANC) sites during the 16th round of HSS in India. This was a cross-sectional study based on the findings of the supervisory visits conducted by public health specialists in ANC sites during the 16th round of HSS from January to March 2019. Semi-structured checklists were used to assess site-preparedness and adherence to the SOP for HSS. All supervisors were expected to upload the filled pro forma to the HSS management information system (MIS). We present here a descriptive analysis of the uploaded visit reports. Of 870 HSS sites, 783 (90%) were visited, and 479 (61.2%) reports were uploaded to MIS. Preround HSS training was not attended by one-fifth (22.6%) of the site in-charges; 35.8% of them had never received any HSS training. SOP was followed at most (94%) of the sites. The most frequently reported problem at the sites was inadequate or delayed availability of consumables. The overall quality of site-level preparedness at antenatal clinic sites in India was good. Attention needs to be given to timely and adequate availability of consumables at sentinel sites along with proper administrative support and preround training of site in-charges. ","234":"","235":"We report the case of a 22-year-old primigravida detected as having sickle cell disease (SCD), initially presenting in the third trimester (30th week) of pregnancy. The patient came to our center with a complaint of severe lower limb pain. The peripheral smear showed marked anisopoikilocytosis, numerous leptocytes, sickle cells, and target cells. High-performance liquid chromatography corroborated the diagnosis of SCD, showing a significant peak in the sickle window. The patient was conservatively managed and delivered a healthy baby through normal vaginal delivery. Delayed presentation of SCD in the third trimester of pregnancy is unusual. This report aims to bring attention to the possible causes of such a lag in detection. We also suggest measures to refine the antenatal healthcare screening at multiple levels, with regard to the detection of sickle cell hemoglobinopathy.","236":"Strongyloides stercoralis is unique among the nematodes, in which it completes its life cycle inside a single human host by causing autoinfection in the host, and it causes hyperinfection leading to persistent and fatal disseminated infections in immunocompromised hosts. The present case report is about strongyloidiasis fatal hyperinfection in a patient with malignant tumor of the tongue on radiotherapy treatment, to highlight the need for clinical suspicion of strongyloidiasis in an immunocompromised host. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality in strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome is alarmingly high, a case fatality rate that is almost 90%. Hence, the clinicians should be well equipped to diagnose, treat, and also prevent the fatal consequences of this lethal nematode. Detailed workup for this parasitic infection is crucial, and this case report emphasizes that a simple wet mount stool microscopic examination can clinch the diagnosis.","237":"The impact of scholarly journals has increased with invent of Internet due to improved access, faster dissemination, and ease of searching a variety of publications. With the increasing trend of research, open access (OA) publishing has increased intensely over the last few years. The core intent of OA is faster dissemination of research by making it available to readers free of cost. However, some publishers exploited this novel idea for their own benefit. Beall termed them as predatory publishers\/journals. In this article, authors have made efforts to understand the predatory publishers\/journal, reasons behind their upsurge, their modus operandi, their common targets, and the points which will help readers to identify them. The aim of this article is to expose facts behind the predatory journal and to create awareness among not only budding researchers but also faculty members, authors, and editors about the threat predatory journals carry toward scientific world and to their own curricula.","238":"Prenatal testing and diagnosis are gaining a strong foothold in a progressively developing country like India, and an estimated boom in the market of noninvasive prenatal testing is predicted by the year 2024. Having said this, every technique needs an adequate amount of supplementation to increase its worth and that is where genetic counseling proves to be indispensable. Postdiagnosis, the women classified as high-risk individuals likely to give birth to infants inflicted with congenital and structural anomalies are appropriately counseled regarding the clinical aspects of the disease, life expectancy associated with the same, and the consequences associated with the decision to go ahead and conceive the child. Genetic counseling is majorly done for Down syndrome as the other aneuploidies have a highly reduced life expectancy. Although there are a variety of techniques available for testing various chromosomal anomalies, information regarding the appropriate time of the test and emphasis on pre- and posttest counseling is usually not supplied to primary physicians. A considerable amount of confusion dominates the decision of which test should be employed for testing of which anomaly as an array of rather efficient techniques has been identified. Furthermore, there is no nation-wide consensus of the timing and nature of these screening protocols. Moreover, ambiguous guidelines along with an impending lacuna in terms of awareness have led to India being at the backseat of the era that has ushered in tons of technological advancement in this field.","239":"In India, the number of people with disabilities is continuously growing over the past few decades. The figure is expected to increase due to population aging, with a resultant increase in chronic health conditions. The health of people with disabilities is a relatively neglected and ignored area. Further, the disabled face poor access to healthcare and frequently encounter discrimination or stigmatization. These situations make them more vulnerable to many comorbidities in their health, making severe compromises in their quality of life. Therefore, people with disabilities need special healthcare than people without disabilities. There is a need for sensitization of all health-care providers to ensure quality, affordable, and accessible health-care services for people with disabilities. To address the health-care needs of people with disabilities to the maximum, Ministry of Health, Government of India should incorporate appropriate guidelines in various national health programs and work together with a relevant ministry.","240":null,"241":null,"242":"An innovative home-based newborn care (HBNC) voucher system has been introduced in Assam to improve home visits of accredited social health activists (ASHAs), make them more accountable, and empower the community. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of HBNC voucher initiative in Assam. A mixed methodology study was conducted in 2018 including 4 districts of Assam. A quantitative study was done among a sample of 836 lactating mothers by interviewing them through house-to-house visits. A qualitative study was done by in-depth interview of various health-care service providers. Of 836 lactating mothers, 65% received HBNC voucher; 45.6% received at the time of discharge, and 5.3% during antenatal care. The purpose of HBNC vouchers as a tool of validating ASHAs' home visits was explained to only 14.5% of lactating mothers. Examination of newborn (44.6%), counseling on breastfeeding (57.1%), counseling on care of baby (39.2%), and counseling on immunization (49.2%) were the services commonly provided by ASHA during HBNC visits. Voucher system improved incentive payment system, but uninterrupted supply was a problem area as stated by ASHAs. Auxiliary nurse midwives and ASHA supervisors told that voucher system had improved ASHA home visits, payment system, and increased identification of danger signs of newborns. HBNC voucher system as an innovative approach was found to be effective. Coverage of services varied among different districts. Uninterrupted supply of the vouchers, periodic resensitization of health workers on its use, and increasing awareness among the community is needed to be sustained.

The objective of the study was to assess the morbidity profile of children from birth to 18 years of age screened in the district early intervention center (DEIC). A record-based descriptive study was done in the DEIC in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh. The data were retrieved for 1-year from April 2017 to March 2018 into the excel sheet, and the combined master sheet was prepared for analysis. The analysis was done with SPSS 21.0 Version. A total of 10571 children were screened and referred to the DEIC during the period. Out of them, 5679 (53.7%) were male and 4892 (46.3%) were female. Among all the four types of morbidities screened, majority 4847 (45.9%) were having the childhood diseases, 4177 (39.5%) had developmental delays including disabilities, 1067 (10.1%) had different deficiencies, and 361 (3.4%) had birth defects. Among the adolescent health issues, 119 (1.1%) were screened and sent for the early intervention to the district hospital. A huge number of children were screened and referred to the DEIC every year for intervention. The health sector has to focus more on the resources like workforce, training of peripheral health workers at regular intervals about the different morbidities screened, that would help in identifying the morbidities at the earliest possible time and receive the intervention at the best center. ","245":"The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasing dramatically of late, across all ages irrespective of gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. People with MetS have twice the likelihood of developing and dying from cardiovascular disease and more than seven times the risk of developing diabetes. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of MetS among adults who were in their first three decades of adulthood and to find out the risk factors of MetS among them. This was a community based cross-sectional study among 388 subjects aged 18-49 years selected by multistage random sampling in an area of Kolkata, India, from November 2016 to October 2018 over 2 years. Data collection was done using a structured questionnaire along with anthropometry, blood pressure measurement, and relevant blood tests. Physical activity was classified by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-Form questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 16.0), and descriptive statistics were calculated as frequency and percentage. Logistic regression was done to determine the strength of association between MetS and different risk factors. The prevalence of MetS was 44.6% (35.4% in males and 55.6% in females), and female gender, poor economic status, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and addiction of tobacco were found to be the risk factors of MetS in the final model using multivariable logistic regression. This research revealed the high prevalence of MetS in the community. The effective primordial and primary level of prevention along with prevailing secondary or tertiary level of prevention should have been employed to curtail the epidemic of MetS. ","246":"Immunization prevents over 2-3 million deaths each year worldwide. In India, even though vaccines are offered free of cost at public health facilities the coverage remains low. Limited scrutiny has been conducted at health service and client interface for routine immunization (RI) services, which may have been affecting the acceptance of vaccines. This emphasizes the importance of assessing the level of satisfaction and perceived quality of clients regarding RI services. This study aimed to assess the perceived quality and level of overall general satisfaction with RI services of clients. In addition, determine the association of factors influencing clients perceived quality and overall general satisfaction with RI services. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in an urbanized village of Delhi from November 2015 to April 2017. A total of 279 RI visits were covered in the study, and the clients were interviewed at their residence using a pretested tool. The dissatisfaction toward the domains of perceived quality of RI services was reported to be 3.2% for vaccine availability, 9.7% for vaccine information, 3.2% for staff behavior, 6.1% for doctor behavior, and 7.5% for infrastructure. Multivariable-regression analysis indicated that distance to health facility, literacy and age of the client, doctor behavior, staff behavior, and infrastructure had an effect on overall general satisfaction of client toward RI services. The client's perception is multidimensional; improvement in one domain is likely to strengthen the other. By understanding the client's perspective toward quality of RI service, the health-care mangers may improve the level of overall satisfaction. ","247":"Children are vulnerable to injuries, and childhood injury is a complex phenomenon precipitated by a set of factors. In India, the magnitude and nature of childhood injury are not clearly known owing to the absence of a proper injury surveillance system. However, in recent days few studies demonstrated a substantially high burden of childhood injury. To find out the prevalence, pattern, and the factors associated with injury among children of 0-14 years in the Siliguri city of West Bengal. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 780 children aged 0-14 years residing in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation area selected through cluster sampling technique (30 clusters [wards] with a cluster size of 26). Relevant data were collected by interviewing the mothers of children as respondents and was analyzed using SPSS software, binary logistic regression was applied to test the association between injury and other risk factors. Of total 780 children, 165 had reported a total of 220 injury events with an overall period prevalence of 21.2% and a mean of 0.28 injury events per child. Majority of injuries were superficial in nature (53.2%); due to fall (56.4%), extremities were mostly involved (62.3%), and 12.8% cases were moderate-to-severe grade. Under-five children were most vulnerable. Injury was significantly related to socioeconomic status, presence of siblings, outdoor activities, and the presence of supervising person during travelling. Childhood injury is still highly prevalent in the area with its unique pattern and few preventable risk factors requiring a multifaceted comprehensive approach. ","248":"For women living with HIV who do not want to become pregnant or who wish to delay pregnancy, contraception has the added public health benefit of reducing the number of infants who might acquire HIV. The unmet need for contraception must be addressed to prevent unintended pregnancies among HIV-positive women and consequently mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The objectives of this study were to assess the contraceptive usage and its various determinants and to find out the unmet need for family planning among HIV-positive women. This was a cross-sectional descriptive hospital-based study conducted among 235 HIV-positive women attending the ART center of a medical college. Data were collected using a questionnaire-containing sociodemographic details, obstetric history, treatment information, contraceptive usage, and their fertility desires. Data analysis was performed using MS Excel and the SPSS version 20.0 using frequencies, Chi-squared test, and multiple logistic regression. The mean (standard deviation) age of the study participants was 28.8 (5.5) years. Majority (96.6%) of them were married and were illiterate (34.4%). The prevalence of unmet need for family planning was found to be 17%, and the prevalence of consistent contraceptive use was 74.5%. The most common family planning method used by women was male condom. Not having HIV-positive children, HIV-negative partner, and discussing contraceptive with partner were observed to be significant predictor of consistent contraceptive use on multiple logistic regression. There is a need to boost family planning counseling and address the unmet need and contraceptive use among HIV-infected women. ","249":"Scrub typhus infection is endemic in India and reported to be the major cause for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in humans. Periodic occurrence of scrub typhus cases and presence of pathogen in rodents were also reported in areas with human cases of scrub typhus in Puducherry. This study was carried out to screen Orientia tsutsugamushi in rodent\/shrew reservoirs and vectors in villages of Puducherry with no reports of human scrub typhus cases. This study was conducted during October 2017 to January 2018 in ten randomly selected villages in Puducherry. Rodents\/shrews in the peridomestic area were trapped using Sherman traps. Screening of O. tsutsugamushi in rodents\/shrews and mite vectors was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Weil-Felix test was done to screen antibodies against O. tsutsugamushi in rodent serum samples. Among the 54 rodents trapped, Suncus murinus was the major small animal and Leptotrombidium deliense was the major mite species retrieved. PCR screening revealed pathogen positivity in 8 rodent blood and 3 pooled mite samples. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that Kato was the circulating serotype of O. tsutsugamushi. None of the rodent serum samples was tested positive for antibodies against O. tsutsugamushi by Weil-Felix test. The presence of pathogen in both vectors and reservoir animal hosts imposes a risk for scrub typhus transmission to the inhabitants; hence, initiation of vector control measures before the start of winter is recommended in the study area. It is also recommended to screen scrub typhus in patients with undifferentiated acute febrile illness and AES.

The CCEs in government HFs of Delhi were never assessed using the World Health Organization-United Nations Children's Fund (WHO-UNICEF) Effective Vaccine Management (EVM) tool except that of state vaccine store during National EVM assessment 2013. The objective of the study was to assess the CCEs and their management in government HFs using the WHO-UNICEF EVM tool in a district of Delhi. The assessment was done during December 2017-March 2018 in one randomly selected district of Delhi. Sample size and site selection were done using the WHO EVM site selection tool. A total of 29 HFs were assessed along with District Vaccine Store. Questions on CCEs in EVM tool 1.0.9 were used for data collection. Out of 56 electrical CCEs, 8.9% were nonfunctional, 48.2% were noncompliant with WHO standards, 5.4% were not chlorofluorocarbon free, 4.7% did not have temperature monitoring device, and 18.8% did not have stabilizer. Eighty-six percent of passive containers were compliant with the WHO standards. The storage capacity of electrical vaccine storage equipment was insufficient in 3.4%, passive container capacity in 65.5%, and ice packs preparation and storage capacity in 24.1% of HFs. There was no planned preventive maintenance of CCEs and no standard operating procedures for emergency event management. There was a shortage of vaccine storage, ice packs preparation and storage, and passive container capacity. Many CCEs used in ISC of assessed sites were noncompliant to the WHO standards. There was no PPM of CCEs and no guidelines for emergency event management. ","251":"It is necessary to understand the way women think about their health. There is a \"culture of silence\" among women regarding urinary incontinence (UI). Physiotherapy is proven effective mode of therapy in case of UI. This study aimed to explore the attitude of the women toward UI, to understand the related sociocultural factors and health-seeking behavior, and to ascertain the challenges encountered in community-based physiotherapy interventions. A qualitative study was conducted among women who refused to participate in a physiotherapy intervention for UI in the rural community of Gujarat, India. Fourteen in-depth key informant interviews were conducted using an interview guide. The responses were noted and compiled into a composite interview script. Interviews were not recorded due to nonavailability of consent. Interviews were reviewed by investigators and content analysis was carried out. Key themes were identified after multiple iterations. Most of the women were unaware of the UI and believed that it may be due to their gender or due to aging. Physiotherapy interventions were disregarded due to various reasons such as shy nature, lack of priority and privacy, dependency, self-neglect, and influence of social and cultural norms. Cultural and social systems were more important determinants of health seeking than health systems themselves particularly when sensitive issue such as UI in women of rural Western India was concerned. ","252":"Intravenous iron is associated with oxidative stress, and very few studies have assessed change in oxidative stress markers post infusion. The study aimed to measure the change in levels of hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin, and select oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde [MDA], superoxide dismutase [SOD], and ferric reducing ability of plasma [FRAP]) 4 weeks following the administration of intravenous iron sucrose (IVIS) among moderately anemic pregnant women who were attending a secondary-level health-care facility, Haryana, North India. An observational study was conducted (May 2016 to Jan 2018) among pregnant women receiving intravenous iron sucrose i.e., IVIS (300 mg per dose) diluted in 300 mL of normal saline over 20-45 min and were followed up for a period of 4 weeks after the last dose of IVIS (end line). The study outcomes were measured in the levels of Hb, serum ferritin, MDA, SOD, and FRAP from the baseline to the end line. The mean (95% confidence interval) change in the Hb and serum ferritin level 4 weeks after the last dose of IVIS was an increase of 2.5 (2.1-3.0) g\/dL (P &lt; 0.001) and 63.0 (44.7-81.3) ng\/mL (P &lt; 0.001), respectively. There were no significant changes (baseline to end line) in mean (standard deviation [SD]) MDA level and mean (SD) FRAP level. The mean (SD) SOD level declined significantly (2.2 [0.4] U\/mL to 1.6 [0.5] U\/mL [P &lt; 0.001]). No life-threatening adverse events were encountered during the study. IVIS was well tolerated and effective in treating moderate anemia in pregnancy. Body iron store was replenished following IVIS administration. There was no increase in oxidative stress following IVIS therapy. ","253":"HIV serostatus disclosure plays an important role in reducing the risk of HIV transmission. However, its negative effects may include rejection, assault, separation, divorce, stigma, and discrimination. This study was undertaken to find out the proportion of HIV-positive serostatus disclosure to any family member and different factors influencing disclosure among people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA). A cross-sectional study was conducted among all patients aged 18-49 years with confirmed HIV infection registered at the antiretroviral therapy center of a tertiary care hospital in eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, India, for the duration of 1 year, from July 2017 to June 2018. Most of the respondents were aged 30-49 years (79.9%), male (63.2%), married (85.4%), rural residents (60.4%), Hindu (96.5%), literate (84%), employed\/driver (61.8%), and belonged to lower\/lower middle class (62.6%). The rate of disclosure of HIV-positive status to any family member was quite high in this study (238\/288 or 82.6%), among which 92.9% (221\/238) to the spouse only. The number of sexual partners before disclosure, educational status, and socioeconomic status of the respondents were found to be independent predictors of disclosure of HIV-positive status to any family member (P &lt; 0.05). This study indicates the need of giving more emphasis on creating awareness regarding the importance of HIV serostatus disclosure to any family member, especially to spouse, and encourage all PLWHA in the community to disclose their status. Effective strategies also need to be evolved that will target those not likely to disclose their status to anybody.

Delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation are frequently observed among patients with DR-TB, resulting in an increased risk of disease complications and high mortality and pretreatment lost to follow-up rates. To understand the factors associated with delays between the diagnosis and treatment, the study was carried out in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation Area. A total of 177 DR-TB patients diagnosed in the year 2014 who had a delay in the initiation of treatment, and 23 initial defaulters were studied using a structured questionnaire. Fifty-four DOTS providers were also interviewed. Of 177 patients, 62.15% initiated treatment between 7 and 15 days and nearly 12% of them started the treatment after a month. The median duration of delay was 12 days (range: 8-144 days and interquartile range: 9-20 days). The most common reason for the delay in the initiation and initial default was the social and personal factors (48.80%), and in 34 (20%) of the patients, the delay was attributed to the effect of the previous treatment.","257":"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is of paramount importance to achieve the optimum control of viral load and progression of disease among people living with HIV (PLHIV). An overview of systematic reviews to summarize the factors influencing adherence to ART was not found in the literature; hence, the systematic review of systematic reviews was conducted to provide global view of factors influencing adherence to ART. Systematic reviews ever published till May 2018 were searched and retrieved between May 2015 and May 2018 from Cochrane and PubMed databases. Among 88 studies initially chosen based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 were selected for further analysis. Qualitative analysis of included reviews was made through narrative synthesis approach. Results of the study show that among the 60 factors enlisted, 5 were most highly significant, 7 were highly significant, 19 were moderately significant, and 29 were emerged as significant factors. Substance abuse, financial constraints, social support, HIV stigma, and depressive symptoms were the most highly significant factors influencing the adherence, whereas age, employment status, long distance, side effects of drugs, pill burden, education, and mental health were regarded as highly significant factors influencing ART. Fatigue, away from home, being too busy in other things, simply forgot, and beliefs about the necessity of ART emerged as significant factors. The study concludes that findings from the overview give global insight into the factors determining adherence to ART which would further influence the innovations, program, and policy-making to mitigate the problem of nonadherence.","258":"The purpose of the present review is to examine the new competency-based undergraduate curriculum in community medicine against the established frameworks and criteria and suggest the way forward for achieving competencies expected of the Indian Medical Graduate (IMG). The new Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2018, is based on Harden's concept of the curriculum. Hence, we reviewed the components of new curriculum against Harden's conceptualization of various components of the curriculum, and since it claims it is competency-based, we used Tyler's Goal\/Objective-Based Evaluation. The new undergraduate curriculum has shown a move toward integration of course content and defined the competencies in more measurable terms. However, it appears that the earlier information-based curriculum corresponding to book chapters (\"topics\") has been modified to specify higher cognitive domains with no explicit link between the IMG level curriculum outcomes to subject level intended learning outcomes (ILOs). The mechanism to link ILOs to assessment is also not clear and so needs more clarity. The assessment system hinted at in the current document is mostly based on the existing conventional system of 50% as pass cutoff, etc., against criterion-referenced assessment applicable to competencies that need to be performed. Furthermore, there is no guidance on the creation of educational opportunities and environment for students and faculty - perhaps it is left to \"Curriculum Implementation Support Programme (CISP) Workshops.\" Hence, the need for preparing a roadmap\/blueprint to learning experiences and assessment methods and levels and milestones to be reached at various phases of MBBS and during internship is required.","259":"It has been possible to set up special newborn care units (SNCUs) and to improve the survival of newborns in India. However, several challenges remain affecting their effective functioning. Different approaches have been attempted and several policies have also been implemented to address this issue. To evaluate the feasibility of implementing best practices in neonatal care by onsite mentoring in an SNCU over 4 months. The mentoring team was from a tertiary care hospital in Karnataka. The SNCU was functioning at the district hospital, catering to approximately 3500 live births per year. Onsite mentoring was carried out from August 2016 to November 2016. This was a prospective implementation research. Framework focused on infection control, preterm care, care at birth, advocacy for infrastructure and resources, and facility-based refresher training. A total of 16 visits were done by the mentoring team and 2 weeks of in-house residency. There were improvements in hand hygiene compliance from 0% to 87.5%, in cleaner IV site (from 50% to 100%), decreased unnecessary oxygen administration (from 75% to 33.3%), decreased antibiotic usage (from 70.5% to 35.5%), decrease in the number of babies receiving &gt;5 days of antibiotics (from 41.6% to 0%), and increased kangaroo mother care initiation rate from 0% to 41.6%. The facility got level IIA accreditation by the end of the intervention period. Onsite mentorship program of SNCU is feasible and planning should be contextual.

The issue is not limited only to people having limited access to health-care services, but for a variety of reasons, a typical pattern of nonadherence is being seen. The objective was to assess the compliance and to find out the reasons of noncompliance to treatment of diabetes\/hypertension among previously diagnosed patients from urban slums. This is a community-based, cross-sectional study conducted during October 2017-February 2018 in urban slums of Belapur, Navi Mumbai, selecting all cases of diabetes and hypertension diagnosed for &gt;1 year by house-to-house survey, covering a population of 4125. A structured and pretested questionnaire including sociodemographic details, treatment details, and compliance pattern was administered. The study included 208 individuals, of which 164 were under treatment for hypertension and 85 for diabetes. All the patients revealed discontinuation of medication for a significant period at some point since diagnosis. The most common reasons of noncompliance were lack of money (50.58% patients with diabetes, 73.78% patients with hypertension) and difficulty to remember to take daily medication due to work or forgetfulness (49.41% patients with diabetes, 26.21% patients with hypertension). Only 56.5% of patients with diabetes and 64.6% of patients with hypertension were aware that discontinuation of treatment can cause complications, whereas 95.3% of patients with diabetes and 99.4% of patients with hypertension feel that remembering medication at work is difficult. As the nonadherence is too high, there is an urgent need of attention to this aspect, and remedial measures such as proper counseling to the patient, involvement of family members, and use of low-cost drugs for treatment should be sought.

Nutrition and growth are important aspects of this age group. This study aims to estimate average macronutrient intakes in private and public ashram schools and to compare the growth of tribal with urban children and national standards. This is a cross-sectional cluster-based study in Nashik district of Maharashtra in ashram schools with an urban day school for comparison. The study was conducted from November 2017 to February 2018. The study includes 1510 students in four rural ashram schools and 322 urban school day scholars. Daily food amounts used by the school kitchens were analyzed. Height and weight of students were recorded with standard methods. Excel was used to estimate nutrient intakes and Epi Info for analysis of growth parameters. Protein intakes were 76.5 g\/student (2.9-3.1 g\/kg body weight), with staples contributing 42%-50% and legumes and pulses contributing 22%-25%. Energy intakes were 2519 kcal\/student (100-120 kcal\/kg body weight) with oils contributing 13%. Boys ate 1.5-2 times than girls going by average intake of Chapattis. Height and weight of students at entry and exit age, respectively, of 7 and 15 years were significantly lower than urban students, ICMR and IAP standards. However, entry-level stunting had reduced by 15 years by 40%-50% in girls and boys. Macronutrient intakes in the ashram schoolchildren were sufficient, but growth gap persisted till adolescence.

Background, household, entomological, and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) surveys were undertaken post- and premonsoon showers from May to June 2016 in urban and rural practice area of medical college. A total of 181 and 204 households, 131 and 137 individuals, and 1250 and 1268 water-holding containers were included in household survey, KAP survey, and larval survey in urban slum and rural area, respectively. In both locations, maximum water-holding containers were indoors (41.4% and 61.8%, respectively); however, maximum positivity was peridomestic (63.6% and 83.1%, respectively). Pupae per container were 0.9 and 1.9 in respective locations and pupae per person were 1.2 and 2.3, respectively. Container positivity was seen in containers with rain as water source (8.8%) as well as among those who were never used (10.7%). Irregular water supply was significantly more in rural area (P &lt; 0.05). KAP survey revealed that majority (90.1% and 71.5%, respectively) had heard about dengue, with significantly higher knowledge in urban slum, and television was the main source of information. Majority (89% and 83%, respectively) were unaware that peak biting time of Aedes is daytime. Use of mosquito repellent coils was the predominant preventive practice (46.6% and 61.2%, respectively). Pupae were reared; all were found to be Aedes aegypti. Despite enhanced awareness campaigns, an integrated vector management approach is required for prevention of dengue. ","266":"India recently launched Ayushman Bharat - National Health Protection Mission - an upgraded version of Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna (RSBY), which is projected as world's largest public insurance scheme by numbers. The new scheme can certainly draw learning from the former (RSBY) to ensure better reach and success. RSBY has been extensively analyzed for supply-side barriers but sparsely for demand and supply-side barriers simultaneously. Through this study, authors intend to determine causality as well as configurations (pathways) of demand and supply barriers that make beneficiary vulnerable even under the scheme. The study explores the interaction of barriers that lead to patient dis\/satisfaction, overcharging for a medical procedure and high disease severity among beneficiaries. The study uses RSBY insurance claim records from 2013 to 2015 backed up by posthospitalization survey of the state of Chhattisgarh, India. It employs a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to determine causality and configuration (path-way) of parameters leading to the outcome. Provision of medicine emerges as a necessary condition for patient satisfaction. Waiting time did not appear as a necessary parameter of satisfaction. Overcharging the cashless card in case of minor surgical procedures is observed irrespective of beneficiaries' education and occupation status. Urban male and rural female appear to bear high disease severity. Results have implication for policymakers and implementors to recognize the segment that remains vulnerable under the scheme and gain insights on the parameters of patient satisfaction. ","267":"The internet and smartphones have a strong potential for addiction. Excessive use of these technologies can have adverse effects on psychological well-being of the users. The objective of the study is to find out the effects of internet addiction (IA) and smartphone addiction (SA) on psychological outcomes of dental students in an Indian institute. In this cross-sectional study, 320 dental students were assessed for their internet and smartphone habits using the Young's IA test (YIAT) and the SA scale (SAS), respectively. Psychological outcomes were evaluated using the insomnia severity index, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The median YIAT score was 35 and interquartile range (IQR) of 24-49 with 23% subjects reporting potential IA. The median SAS score was 108 (IQR 91.25-128). Both IA and SA were significantly associated with participants' year of the study. Significant correlations were observed between IA and SA with psychological parameters. The association of IA and SA with psychological parameters shows how these habits can affect the users' mental well-being. Public especially young adults should be made aware about potential harmful effects of the internet and smartphones. ","268":"High-quality data are of prime importance in any health survey because survey data are considered as a gold standard for nationally representative data. The quality of data collection largely depends on the design of the questionnaire, training, and skills of the interviewer. In the present study, we tried to evaluate three key components, such as questionnaire design, human resource and training of the field staff for Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance carried out among the HIV high-risk subpopulation. A mixed-methods approach was used. Qualitative and quantitative data collection was carried out in the year 2015 with cross-sectional survey design in western states of India. The in-depth interviews of 10 stakeholders, structured interviews of the survey respondents (n = 560), and field investigators (n = 71) were conducted. Data triangulation was used to find out the concurrence of the qualitative and quantitative data. Comprehensive and standardized survey questionnaire, structured training agenda, and strategic preparation for recruiting human resources were the overall strengths of the survey. However, during the implementation of the survey, there were some difficulties reported in data collection process. Overall, the respondents and investigators felt that the questionnaire was long and exhaustive. Difficulties were faced while collecting data on sexual history. The field staffs were not adequately experienced to work with sensitive population. In order to have accurate, reliable data, especially on sexual behavior; emphasis should be given on simple questionnaire with the use of community-friendly language, skilled and experienced interviewers for data collection, and extensive field training. ","269":"Despite being a sensitive and less explored issue, abortion is a major preventable cause of maternal morbidity and mortality affecting millions of women in developing countries. The study aimed to determine the occurrence, nature, and predictors of abortion among women in the reproductive age group in Naxalbari block of Darjeeling district. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Naxalbari block of Darjeeling district, West Bengal, India, from May 2015 to April 2016, among 420 women aged 15-49 years selected from 30 villages by cluster sampling technique. A predesigned, pretested interview schedule validated in the local vernacular was used. Binary logistic regression was used for finding out predictors of abortion among ever-pregnant women. Lifetime occurrence of abortion was 33.6%. Among total 178 events of abortion, 51.7% were spontaneous and 48.3% induced. Majority of spontaneous abortions events were attended by a doctor (73.9%). About 59.3% of induced abortions were illegal, and unwanted pregnancy was major reason (62.4%) for induced abortion. Private facilities and over the counter drugs were preferred. Lower education, nuclear family, number of children &lt;2, not having male child, domestic violence during pregnancy were significant predictors of abortion. Illegal abortions were highly prevalent in the area. Unwanted pregnancies hint toward unmet needs of family planning. Stigma and poor awareness were the root cause of not visiting a health facility in case of abortions. Building up of better infrastructure, better orientation of frontline workers, non-judgemental and confidential services will attract women to in government facilities. ","270":"Adolescence is a period of transition where independence in thinking and behavior is established and food choices that are made are followed for several years, and this can influence their health in adulthood. Hence, understanding the eating habits are necessary to plan effective nutritional interventions in adolescents. The main objective of the study is to find out the extent of malnutrition among rural adolescents as well as evaluate their eating habits against recommended dietary food groups and to compare eating habits across gender and age groups. A cross-sectional study was done among 1425 adolescents from 13 rural schools from 2014 to 2015, and the variables considered in this study were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and the eating habits of the adolescents. Undernutrition was seen among 23% and overweight\/obesity among 8% of adolescents. The habit of taking milk and milk products, fruits, and green leafy vegetables were very poor among the adolescents. Significant association was found between eating habits and BMI. Furthermore, late adolescents had better eating habits, and significant gender difference was seen in certain eating habits. The study shows that it is possible to understand the gaps in eating habits of adolescents, and this can be used to plan tailor-made nutritional interventions to adolescent groups as their eating habits are different and have long-term nutritional and health implications.

Perceived burden and care for the child with autism, available forms of social support, and the interactions between the autistic child and other family members are areas of significant concern for families. The objective of this study was to determine the burden of care perceived by the principal caregivers of autistic children or adolescent visiting health facilities in Lucknow city. The cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2016 to September 2017 with a sample of 90 principal caregivers (aged &lt;60 years) of autistic children and adolescents aged 3-19 years and diagnosed with autism, attending government and private health facilities providing treatment for autism in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. Validated tools were used to assess the burden of care and disability level of autistic children. Data were analyzed using the software SPSS version 16. The caregivers of autistic children and adolescents perceived the burden of care in different domains in varying extent with \"caregiver's routine\" and \"taking responsibility\" domains affected the most. The burden perceived was found to be affected by the permanent residence of caregiver, rural\/urban dwelling, type of family, socioeconomic status, age at which diagnosis was made, knowledge about autism and the severity of autism. Availability and easy accessibility of autism treatment facilities must be the most probable reason for less burden perceived in three domains, by caregivers of urban settings and those belonging to Lucknow. Furthermore, better knowledge on autism and family and friends' support led to decrease in the burden perceived by the caregivers in various domains. Thus, it was found that the burden perceived can be reduced by universal availability of evidence-based early diagnosis and treatment of autism and improving the knowledge of caregivers about autism.

The objective of the study is to develop and validate appropriate assessment tools for the community medicine entrustable professional activities (EPAs) and to assess the usefulness of the validated tools in the assessment of postgraduate (PG) students. An interventional study for 14 months was done in the department of community medicine. After the sensitization of faculty members and PGs, three EPAs were selected through consensus between faculty members and appropriate assessment tools mini-clinical evaluation exercise (Mini-CEX), case-based discussion (CBD), and direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS). Rubrics of milestones were formulated for the selected tools, and the designed tools were validated. These three validated tools were used for the quarterly assessment. The item-content validity index for all three assessment tools was one, while Scale Content Validity Index for Mini-CEX and CBD were 1, and for DOPS, it was 0.87. Three PG students were assessed using the validated tools thrice for the three selected EPAs. The PGs opined that assessment using rubrics made their task-specific, while faculties were quite satisfied with the assessment process as it removed subjectivity. The developed and selected tools of EPAs were found to have a substantial level of both face validity and content validity. The tools were also found to useful for periodic assessment in workplace settings and acceptable to both PG students and internal\/external faculty members.

An effort was made to develop a draft policy paper which can help the Government of India to develop a national rabies vaccination policy for humans and for achieving the goal of zero dog-mediated human rabies deaths by the year 2030. A technical stakeholders meeting was held under the chairmanship of the Drug Controller General of India at New Delhi in December 2017 to discuss the problems and solutions for providing essential rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). The following problems and dilemmas were identified: frequent shortages of life-saving rabies vaccines and rabies immunoglobulin for PEP; as rabies vaccines are mostly procured by the state governments that often face resource crunch and hurdles in logistics within the states; production levels of rabies biologicals in the public sector are low; and the export of rabies biologicals from the private sector needs to be critically evaluated in the context of frequent stock-outs in the domestic market and also the national vaccine security.","276":"The Indian Islands of Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep have been historically rabies-free. However, reliable laboratory evidence to substantiate rabies-free status was lacking. In this background, the study was conducted as a component of the World Health Organization-Association for Prevention and Control of Rabies in India, Indian Multi-Centric Rabies Survey; to assess the rabies-free status of the two Islands and to examine the feasibility of initiating laboratory surveillance for rabies in dogs in Andaman, Nicobar, and Cats in Lakshadweep Islands. A team of medical and veterinary investigators visited these Islands in 2017. A review of 10 years records (2007-2017) in medical and veterinary institutes and interviews with different stakeholders were conducted. Based on the review of records, there was no evidence of human\/animal rabies in the Islands. Eight dog brain samples from Andaman, Nicobar Islands, and ten cat brain samples from Lakshadweep Islands were tested negative for rabies by fluorescent antibody test at two rabies diagnostic laboratories at Bengaluru.","277":"The expenditure for rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is substantial, especially for the poor who are affected the most. The present study was conducted to determine the cost incurred to a patient and the healthcare facility for providing PEP in different healthcare settings. A multicentric, health facility-based study was conducted from May 2017 to January 2018 in the six states involving 18 healthcare facilities. The study included 529 animal bite cases; most of them belonged to either category III (54.4%) or category II (43.1%) exposures and all of them received complete PEP. The total median cost incurred to the patients for complete PEP in the government health facility was INR 1400 (USD 22) and in private hospitals was INR 3685 (USD 58). The cost of PEP for the bite victims is considerable; therefore, it has to be provided free of charge at all healthcare facilities.","278":"Rabies vaccines and immunoglobulins are lifesaving in humans following animal exposures. These biologicals should continuously be available throughout the year to prevent and eliminate human rabies by 2030. The present study aimed at assessing availability of different kinds of human rabies biologicals in the country and undertaking market mapping and landscape analysis of human rabies biologicals in India. The study comprising both quantitative and qualitative approach was conducted from May to November 2017 as a part of the Indian multicentric rabies survey by Association for Prevention and Control of Rabies in India. All stakeholders (agencies\/personnel) associated with rabies biologicals were the study units\/participants. Required data were generated through brainstorming sessions with key stakeholders; reviewing of databases\/existing literature; conducting in-depth surveys; interviewing; focused group discussions, etc. Two types of cell culture rabies vaccines are available in the country manufactured by different pharmaceutical companies; most of the vaccines are indigenously produced and the market size of the rabies vaccines is about INR 125 crores with highest sales in the northern region followed by South. Likewise, there are 2 types of immunoglobulin available, i.e., equine rabies immunoglobulins (RIGs), which are indigenously produced and human RIGs, which are imported. The market value of RIGs is about INR 83 crores. A novel rabies monoclonal antibody is also been marketed in the country from November 2017. There are many lacunas in the market availability of rabies biologicals in different parts of the country; therefore, a significant expansion\/shift in focus must be considered, through rigorous strategic planning process. ","279":"To achieve the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies by 2030, all bite victims shall have access to life-saving rabies biologicals across the country. The information on procurement, distribution, availability, and utilization of rabies biologicals for postexposure prophylaxis is insufficient. The objective of the study is to assess the demand, procurement, distribution, availability, storage, and utilization of rabies biologicals and to appraise the monitoring and reporting of rabies biologicals at all the levels. A multicentric survey was conducted from July to December 2017 in seven regional representative states across the country. The survey team visited the offices in-charge for logistics of rabies biologicals at the survey states and districts; information was collected using structured pro formas and perusing relevant records. District vaccine stores and health institutions in urban and rural areas were visited to assess the availability and stock-outs of rabies biologicals. Procurement, distribution, and availability of rabies biologicals grossly vary between states, since it is the state subject. In Gujarat, both vaccines and immunoglobulins were available even at the Primary Health Centre level; paradoxically, there was a scarcity of both at the district level in Manipur. Immunoglobulins were used only in nine of the surveyed 27 government health-care facilities (33.3%) and two of the eight private facilities (25%). The cold chain facility for storage of rabies biologicals was satisfactory; however, the monitoring and reporting of rabies biologicals were not complete. The procurement, distribution, availability, and utilization of rabies biologicals were not universal across the states. Frequent shortages of supply have to be improved to attain universal coverage.

It was considered important to assess their facilities under a nationwide multi-centric survey. The objective of this study is to assess the facilities available for PEP at the anti-rabies clinics and to ascertain the PEP provided at the anti-rabies clinics. The cross-sectional assessment was made from May 2017 to January 2018 in selected seven states of India. Thirty-five anti-rabies clinics from both Government and private; urban and rural areas from the states were assessed by an expert team using a pretested checklist for facilities and services available for PEP. On an average, 10 new animal bite cases were attended at each anti-rabies clinic per day. The cold chain facilities for rabies biologicals were satisfactory. The facilities for wound washing (54.3%) and the use of antiseptics to animal bite wounds were not adequate. Rabies vaccines were administered by intramuscular in 54.3% and by intradermal route in 45.7% of the cases. The vaccine stock-outs were reported only in the government sector (18.5%). The type of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) used was equine (63.2%) and human (36.8%); given free of cost in 40% of Anti rabies clinics. The local wound infiltration of RIG was in practice at 58.6% of anti-rabies clinics. The stock-out of RIG was more in private (50%) hospitals than in Government (40.7%) hospitals. The facilities available for PEP at the anti-rabies clinics were inadequate and have to be improved across the country. ","281":"In rabies endemic countries, where every animal bite is potentially a suspected rabid exposure, the exposed individuals should seek early and proper health care. It is also essential to complete the full course of postexposure vaccination to protect against rabies. The study aimed at determining the health-seeking behavior of animal bite victims; assessing the perceived risk of rabies transmission from different animals and knowledge on its prevention and finding out the compliance to complete course of rabies vaccination and associated factors. A multi-centric, health facility-based survey was conducted during May 2017 to January 2018 in six regional-representative states involving 18 health facilities. Study participants were animal bite victims attending the health facilities. The data from all the study participants across the country were compiled and analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square test to find out the association of factors influencing compliance. Among a total of 529 animal bite victims, 83.6% sought postexposure prophylaxis coming directly to health facility; others visited nonallopathic\/traditional healers\/veterinarians\/Auxiliary Nursing Midwifery before coming to health facility. The perceived risk of disease transmission and knowledge on the prevention of rabies was insufficient among the exposed victims. All participants were started with anti-rabies vaccination; the compliance rate for the full course of intramuscular rabies vaccination was 65.9% and for intra-dermal rabies vaccination, it was 85.1%. Among Category III exposures, only 46.2% received rabies immunoglobulin. Health-seeking behavior and compliance to complete course of anti-rabies vaccination is unsatisfactory, which has to be improved to prevent rabies. ","282":"Rabies is a fatal but preventable disease. Around the world, awareness studies about rabies have been widely used to understand the disease and in its preventive measures. The present study was conducted to assess the awareness of rabies as a disease, its transmission, and prevention among the general population and also to assess the perceived health risks associated with exposure to animals. A cross-sectional study was undertaken across seven representative states in India between July and November 2017. Multistage sampling methodology was followed to select 1012 households as the primary sampling unit, and one adult responsible respondent from each household was interviewed as study participants. Six hundred and eleven (60.4%) participants had heard of rabies. Only 0.2% had extensive knowledge of rabies. Majority (440, 72.0%) of the participants considered rabies as a fatal disease; 77.3% opined that risk of rabies from dogs was high compared to 41.6% who believed that there was little or no risk of rabies from cats. Only 37 (3.7%) participants were aware about preexposure prophylaxis. The awareness on rabies and its prevention in the study population was not satisfactory. ","283":"Rabies is a 100% fatal disease. There are inadequate data on animal exposures and rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) from community-based field surveys in India. : The main objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of animal exposures (bite, scratch, or lick) in the study population and to describe the rabies PEP among the cases. A descriptive survey was conducted in seven states of India between July and November, 2017. In each state, multistage sampling methodology was followed for selection of district, taluka\/tehsil, block, and clusters within the block. The primary sampling unit was a household (HH). A case was a patient with animal exposure (bite, scratch, or lick) in the last 1 year from the date of survey. The animal exposure was categorized based on the WHO guidelines (Category-I, Category-II, and Category-III). The patients with the history of multiple animal exposures any time during the survey period was considered as a single case. A total of 1012 HHs were surveyed covering a population of 4294. 3016 (70.2%) participants were from rural settings and 1278 (29.8%) were living in urban settings. 2181 (50.8%) participants were male and 2113 (49.2%) were female. The annual incidence of animal exposure was 1.26% (confidence interval [CI]: 0.93%-1.59%). The annual incidence in urban setting was 1.33% (0.70 - 1.96) and rural settings were 1.23% (CI: 0.84 - 1.62). Majority (68.5%) of the cases were from rural settings, 61.2% of the cases were in the age group of 15-60 years. Among the 43 cases who had received PEP, 21 had Category-II exposures, of whom 66.7% had completed vaccination with either five doses intramuscular or four doses intradermal route. Similarly, 22 had Category-III exposures and only 4 (18.2%) cases had received rabies immunoglobulin and completed rabies vaccination. Six ( 11.1%) cases did not receive PEP. There was no report of human rabies case. The incidence of animal exposure was 1.26%. Rabies PEP in the cases was not satisfactory. ","284":"The key to understanding the burden of animal bites and rabies lies in accurate and timely data with the help of proper surveillance system across the country. Such a surveillance system needs to be evaluated also for a programmatic purpose. The present study was conducted to appraise the surveillance system of human rabies and animal bites in seven states of India and also to describe the characteristics of human rabies cases in the states. The record-based study was conducted from July to December 2017. The survey team collected information about the surveillance status of human rabies from the infectious diseases hospitals and animal bites from integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) offices of the respective states for 2012-2016. At the national level, also number of animal exposures and the human rabies cases were collected from the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence and IDSP and compared for concordance. There was a gross underreporting of human rabies from the states to Government of India, and there was no concordance in the reports of animal bites between the IDSP offices of the states and NCDC, New Delhi, India. There was a gradual decline in the reported cases of human rabies from the states during the 5-year period of 2012-2016, attributable to improvement in the overall rabies postexposure prophylaxis services. The documentation of information of the human rabies cases was poor in the infectious disease hospitals.

This is the time when habits are inculcated which will carry forward to adult life. Sleeping patterns among adolescents have an impact on their overall health. Early substance use initiation is a serious concern because it is associated with significantly increased risks for developing substance use disorders. In general, aggressive behaviors progress from less to more severe over the course of adolescent development. The objectives of this study are to determine the lifestyle behaviors of young adolescents focusing on sleep pattern, aggressive behavior, and substance use. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 739 students of Class VII and VIII in both government and private schools in Imphal West and Kangpokpi districts of Manipur between August 27 and September 25, 2017. A pretested, structured questionnaire was used, which included the modified version of Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire. The data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS software (IBM SPSS for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY, USA). Only 56.2% of the students had adequate sleep. The proportion of adolescents using alcohol, tobacco, cigarettes, and Ganja was 4.6%, 9.5%, 5.7%, and 1.6%, respectively. Aggressive behavior was shown by 35.3%. Male students were getting more sleep (60.7%), were more aggressive (38.8%), and were using tobacco and cigarettes (82.4%) more than female students.

The study was conducted to assess whole-grain intake pattern and factors influencing intake among Malaysian medical students. A cross-sectional study investigating whole-grain intake among 151 medical students in a private medical university in Malaysia was conducted from January to June 2018. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess sociodemographic variables, the whole-grain intake pattern and the knowledge and attitudes toward whole-grain intake. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software. Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression were used. The prevalence of reported whole-grain intake in the past 3 months was 51%. Chinese ethnicity, readiness to adhere to Malaysian food pyramid, and self-preparation of food, and eating at home were significantly associated with whole-grain consumption. However, the primary determinants of food choice such as education, knowledge, and affordability did not seem to influence whole-grain consumption. Whole-grain consumption is relatively low among Malaysian medical students. Cultural background and self-belief influence this practice despite being from the medical fraternity.

","297":"Pregnancy is a state, which is often associated with extreme joy and happiness. Women undergo a number of physiological and psychological changes during pregnancy, which are often stressful if aligned with other adverse life events, compromising their health and well-being. However, there exists no comprehensive psychological instruments for measuring this stress. The study was conducted to develop a multidimensional scale to assess prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) comprehensively. The initial phase of the study focuses on developing items and assessing the content validity of these items. The second phase focuses on pilot-testing and field-testing the newly developed perceived PNMS scale (PPNMSS) among 356 pregnant women belonging to different parity and trimester from November 2015 to October 2016. The underlying factor structure of the 28-item PPNMSS had explored using exploratory factor analysis. The final scale is retained with 15 items having considerable item loading under four major factors as follows: perceived social support, pregnancy-specific concerns, intimate partner relations, and financial concerns. Reliability of each of these dimensions was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Convergent and divergent validity of the scale was assessed by correlating the scores with perceived stress scale and the World Health Organization (five) well-being index (1998 version). As a comprehensive scale, PPNMSS is efficient to measure PNMS, which facilitates an early detection of stress and depression among pregnant women and timely intervention by health care professionals. ","298":"Research on different measures of food security and their interrelation in order to identify vulnerable households are scarce in India. The objective was to assess household food security (HHFS), nutrient adequacy, dietary diversity, and nutritional status of under-five children along with their interrelation in the slums of Bankura Municipality, West Bengal. A cross-sectional study was conducted during 2016-2017 among 240 households using two-stage 30-cluster random sampling. Information regarding socioeconomic characteristics, availability, and utilization of different poverty alleviation schemes was collected. HHFS was assessed by a validated HHFS scale-short form in Bengali and nutrient adequacy with 24-h recall method. The eldest under-five child in the family was measured for anthropometry using standard procedure and for dietary diversity with the Individual Dietary Diversity Score. Overall, 74 (29.1%) households had \"food security,\" whereas 102 (44.3%) and 64 (26.6%) had, respectively, low and very low food security. Among 190 under-five children, 63 (35.3%) had single and 50 (25.5%) had multiple anthropometric failures. Overall, 89 (36.1%) households were deficient for both energy and protein and 111 (47.6%) had deficiency of either of these two. Indicators on the utilization of different poverty alleviation schemes were associated with low\/very low food security. A \"Composite Index of Food Scarcity\" comprising of HHFS, nutrient adequacy, and dietary diversity was proposed which was found to have dose-response relationship with grades of anthropometric failure of under-five children. An index comprising of three indicators might help identify the vulnerable households in relation to food security more effectively than a single indicator. ","299":"Iodine deficiency is one of the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies globally. Women in reproductive age group are vulnerable to develop iodine deficiency as there is an increase in demand for iodine, especially during pregnancy. The objective is to assess the prevalence of goiter and its association with iodine status and salt usage practices among the women of reproductive age group. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2015 to July 2017 among 1500 women of reproductive age group in five villages of Udupi Taluk. Stratified sampling design and proportion to population size of the reproductive age women in the study area was used to select the study participants. A pretested semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Goiter was assessed clinically and graded as per the recommended criteria of the WHO. Salt samples from every household were collected for iodine estimation. Blood and urine samples were collected from subsample to estimate thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and urinary iodine excretion levels, respectively. The overall prevalence of goiter was 13% with 11.5% being Grade 1 and 1.5% being Grade 2. No significant association of goiter with urinary iodine, salt iodine levels, and salt usage practices was found. Median urinary iodine among the women with goiter indicates iodine sufficiency and no significant difference observed in urinary iodine levels between women with and without goiter.

The study aimed to find out the surgical consumables using always, better, and control (ABC) and vital, essential, and desirable (VED) technique as well as calculating the lead time of specific category A and vital surgical consumables. This was a descriptive, record-based study conducted from January to March 2016 in the surgical stores of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The study comprised all the surgical consumables which were procured during the financial year 2014-2015. Stores ledger containing details of the consumption of the items, supply orders, and procurement files of the items were studied for performing ABC analysis and calculating the lead time. A list of surgical consumables was distributed to the doctors, nursing staff, technical staff, and hospital stores personnel to categorize them into VED categories after explaining them the basis for the classification. ABC analysis revealed that 35 items (14%), 52 items (21%), and 171 items (69%) were categorized into A (70% annual consumption value [ACV]), B (20% ACV), and C (10% ACV) category, respectively. In the current study, vital items comprised the majority of the items, i.e., 73% of the total items and essential (E) category of items comprised 26% of all the items. The average internal, external, and total lead time was 17 days (range 3-30 days), 25 days (range 5-38) and 44 days (range 18-98 days), respectively. Hospitals stores need to implement inventory management techniques to reduce the number of stock-outs and internal lead time. ","301":"The concurrent occurrence of many noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factors is common, and it can play a synergistic role in occurrence of NCDs. This study aimed to identify the magnitude of clustering of NCD risk factors, patterns of risk factors emerged in clustering, and variations in clustering of risk factors based on socioeconomic factors. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in an urban area of Puducherry among 2399 adults during 2014-2015. Sociodemographic and behavioral risk factors were assessed through a validated STEPS survey tool. Individuals with three or more risk factors were classified to have clustering of NCD risk factors. Socioeconomic positions in relation to clustering were identified through Chi-square analysis followed by multiple logistic regression where clustering at family and area was adjusted through multilevel modeling techniques. Of the 2399 adults, 1741 (73%) had clustering of NCD risk factors. Inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, high salt intake, and high waist circumference are the three predominant risk factors across all subgroups. Adults belonging to Christian religion (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR]: 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-5.2), aged 35 years and over (adjOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-6.0), and illiterates (adjOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-5.5) are more likely to have clustered NCD risk factors compared to others. Clustering of NCD risk factors is highly prevalent in this region and mainly driven by dietary practices and obesity measures. There is an urgent need to reorient the health system toward integrated approach with mandated inclusion of nutritionist in NCD health service delivery.

Understanding local community perspectives is essential to strengthen ongoing program activities. The study aimed to assess the community perceptions and risk reduction practices toward prevention and control of malaria and dengue at slums of Chetla in South Kolkata and to explore the perspectives of relevant local stakeholders in this regard. This cross-sectional study with mixed-method design was conducted from June to September 2018. Quantitative data were collected in 288 sampled households through face-to-face interview of respondents and environmental checklist, whereas, qualitative exploration was done with five key informant interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 Software. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically using \"cut and sort\" processing technique. In household survey, majority had unsatisfactory knowledge (68.4%), attitude (64.2%), and practices (62.8%) regarding diseases prevention\/control, which was further substantiated by qualitative findings. The use of electric fans (79.5%), mosquito repellents (53.8%) were predominant practices; however, only a few used bed nets regularly (26.0%). Reportedly, \"heat\" and \"poor ventilation\" were key reasons behind reluctance to use bed nets. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that increasing age, proximity to a nearby canal, and unsatisfactory knowledge significantly predicted unfavorable attitude, whereas, respondents' gender and unfavorable attitude significantly predicted poor practices. Intensified social behavior change communication with active community participation is the need of the hour to prevent malaria and dengue occurrence and future outbreaks.

Depression was not found to be associated with religion, gender, marital status, HIV status, presence of diabetes, DOTS category nor with the phase of treatment. Depression among TB patients is common, affecting almost one in four TB patients. Physicians and DOTS providers should have a high index of suspicion for depression when assessing TB patients. ","332":"Tobacco products are the major contributors for various cancers and other diseases. In India, tobacco-related cancers (TRCs) contribute nearly half of the total cancers in males and one-fifth in females. The objective of the study is to investigate 25-year trends and projection of TRCs for 2018-2022. Joinpoint analysis was performed to assess the trends of TRCs on world age-adjusted rates. Age-period-cohort model with power link function was performed to project the future incidence burden of TRCs in urban Delhi. During the 25 years, a total of 67,129 TRCs (53,125 males and 14,004 females) were registered which was 25.4% of total cancer cases registered. Males contributed 39.1% and females 10.8% of total cases. In males, TRCs declined significantly from 1988 to 2003 with estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) = -0.91% and thereafter increasing trend was observed with EAPC = 3.42%, while in females, the EAPC values were 2.2% and 3.54% respectively for the same period. The total burden of TRCs will be doubled in 2018-2022 with around 46% change due to cancer risk and around 54% due to population age and size in both the genders. The average annual count in males will be 7310 in 2018-2022 as compared to 3571 in 2008-2012 while in females this count will be increased to 2066 from 955 based on recent slope. The incidence of TRCs is increasing due to increase in population age, size, and factors other than population. TRCs are the preventable cancers, and load of these cancers can be controlled with strictly adhering the policy and acts. ","333":null,"334":"Falls is one of the common problems faced by elderly population and in preventing falls in India, research has largely focused on identification and management of risk factors, but the circumstances of the fall and its associated factors are sparsely researched. The primary objective is to find the prevalence of fall, investigate risk factors, and its circumstances for falls and level of functional independence in elderly population. The secondary objective is to find out fear of fall (FOF) and its association of demographic factors on elderly population. This was a cross-sectional study; 2049 elderly population of 60 years and above were recruited by one-stage cluster sampling technique within Mumbai, Panvel, and Thane cities, Maharashtra. Data were collected using a questionnaire, Fall Efficacy Scale-International, Barthel Index, and Kuppuswamy Scale. Obtained responses were analyzed using SPSS software; descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were applied. The prevalence of falls in this study found as 24.98%. Demographic factors such as age group, education, marital status, and socio-economic status had demonstrated a significant association with older adults (P &lt; 0.05); 44.92% of falls occurred in the morning, the majority of falls (65.43%) occurred indoors, 56.45% of the fallers reported to had slips, and 60.55% of the fallers had sustained injuries. From the total participants, 34.70% of the fallers reported FOF, 23.67% of the fallers expressed reduced functional activities, and 18.06% of the fallers demonstrated affection in activities of daily living. This study reveals fall as a significant health problem and provides insight into the influencing risk factors for falls among older adults. ","335":"Oral health is recognized as an integral component of general health, and poor oral health is reflected in general health and quality of life (QoL). India has seen a profound shift in the elderly population and is currently home to 103.9 million elders. General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) is a self-reported oral health assessment index used in elderly population and has been tested in multiple countries. The study aimed to assess the oral health-related QoL (OHRQoL) using GOHAI and various factors affecting it, among elderly patients visiting special Sunday geriatric clinics at Delhi public hospitals. A cross-sectional study was conducted among four purposively selected special geriatric public clinics in Delhi, India, and a convenience sample of 145 elderly patients was obtained. OHRQoL was measured using a prevalidated instrument (GOHAI) along with other variables (sociodemographic factors, self-perceived oral health, utilization of medical\/dental services, dental problems in the past 12 months, and prosthetic status\/need). Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 21, and descriptive results were obtained. The sample consisted of 66 males (45.5%) and 79 females (55.5%), and around 58% (n = 84) of the participants were illiterate. Around 39% (n = 57) of the elderly had never visited a dentist and 48% (n = 69) were financially dependent (no income) on others. The mean GOHAI score for the population was 26.69 + 4.44 (median = 25, interquartile range = 23-27). GOHAI score was compared for age, oral hygiene practices, dental problems in the past 12 months, self-reported oral health, and prosthetic need, and a statistically significant difference was observed. The current study assessed GOHAI score and highlighted important determinants of OHRQoL in elderly population visiting the special clinics in Delhi. Thus, OHRQoL should be considered as a surrogate measure to clinical oral examination. ","336":"Uttar Pradesh is the most populated state of the country having population of 199.581 million and total fertility rate of 3.3 (annual health survey [AHS] 2012-2013) with high fertile trajectory. Currently, female sterilization accounts for about 18.4% and male sterilization for 0.3% of all sterilizations in Uttar Pradesh (AHS 2012-2013). A strategy to promote men's involvement in effective birth control is needed to reduce the population growth. Since no scalpel vasectomy (NSV) is an easy method but still not being utilized; hence, the purpose of this research is to ascertain various factors of nonutilization of NSV. The objective of the study is (i) to determine the barriers among married males for adopting NSV as a method of family planning, (ii) to determine the awareness about NSV, (iii) to suggest measures to increase uptake of NSV by the people. A cross-sectional study was carried out. A two-staged multistage random sampling technique was used. Lucknow is divided into eight Nagar Nigam zones. In the first stage, two urban slums from each geographical zone were selected randomly. In the second stage, from each selected slum a sample of 24 eligible households was selected at random to achieve the desired sample size. It was observed that among the study participants maximum 89.2% perceived Sociocultural barriers, while 0.6% of the participants perceived service delivery barriers. However, 14% of the participants also perceived procedure-related barriers as the most important cause for not accepting NSV. Measures should be taken to remove these barriers, and increase uptake of NSV.

Adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth have been reported to be associated with anemia. However, different studies have shown inconsistent results. In the present study, we report the association between maternal hemoglobin levels at the time of delivery and outcomes among women at a secondary care hospital in northern India. Secondary analysis of routinely collected hospital data from January 2015 to December 2016 was carried out. Sociodemographic details, hemoglobin levels at the time of admission, and birth outcomes were retrieved from the records of women admitted for delivery. The outcomes were compared among anemic and nonanemic women. About 78% of the women were found to have anemia at the time of delivery. A significantly higher proportion of anemic women had preterm labor.","341":"Adolescent population is the major demographic and economic force of a nation. Adolescent mental health not only affects overall health at present but also in future life. In this cross-sectional study, 461 rural adolescent students studying in Pune city and the rural area from a block in Nanded district, Maharashtra, were administered a prevalidated, pretested Marathi depression anxiety and stress scale-21 tool including correlated factors to assess the magnitude of depression, anxiety, and stress and its stressors. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among these students was 54%, 60%, and 44%, respectively. Rural students in Pune city were having significantly higher levels of stress than the students studying in the rural area. Disturbed family, harsh parenting, past adverse event experiences, negative feeling about academic performance and tobacco use were significantly associated with higher rates. Findings indicate that the mental health status of these students is alarming needing prompt measures.","342":"A study of sources of finance which the household resorts to, in order to meet the hospitalization expense can be of use to policy makers who may want to work in the direction of providing financial security against hospitalization expenses to the masses. In this view, an attempt has been made to study the sources of finance for hospitalized treatment at an individual level based on criteria such as level of living, socio-economic background, level of care in India, as well as at state level through unit level data of the survey on \"Social Consumption related to Health\", conducted by National Sample Survey (NSS) during January, 2014 to June, 2014. It has been found that the household's income or saving is not sufficient to meet the expenditure for hospitalized treatment and people have to borrow or arrange finance by other means for hospitalized treatment across the country. The results thereby suggest inputs to policy makers and re-establish the necessity of appropriate policy in order to provide financial security against escalating medical expenses.","343":"Dental diseases and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) share common risks. Omnipresent and easily available sugars are a contributing risk factor for overweight, obesity, and diabetes. In addition, sugar consumption is known to cause dental caries in early childhood (early childhood caries) and in adults. It has been noticed that the prevalence of NCDs is increasing each year, leading to 70% of deaths. A symposium of diverse academicians was convened to identify the gaps in evidence, policy, and advocacy for action on sugars, emphasizing on its detrimental effects on oral health. Existence of policies on sugars, experiences of other countries, feasibility in India, and the role of public health dentists, public, and stakeholders were discussed. Policy priorities in India and advocacy to strengthen action against inappropriate sugar intake could help address the growing burden of sugar-related NCDs. Recommendations to this end were put forth by the panel of experts.","344":"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have become a major public health problem in India accounting for 62% of the total burden of foregone DALYs and 53% of total deaths. Out-of-pocket expenditure associated with the acute and long-term effects of NCDs is high resulting in catastrophic health expenditure for the households. A large national survey in India found that spending on NCDs accounted for 5.17% of household expenditure. According to a macroeconomic analysis, it is estimated that each 10% increase in NCDs is associated with a 0.5% lower rate of annual economic growth. The income loss due to hypertension is the highest, followed by diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The macroeconomic impact of NCDs is profound as they cause loss of productivity and decrease in gross domestic product. Since the health sector alone cannot deal with the \"chronic emergency\" of NCDs, a multisectoral action addressing the social determinants and strengthening of health systems for universal coverage to population and individual services is required.","345":"In the era of the sustainable development goals, India is committed to reduce its maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per one lakh live births by 2030. An important strategy that was adopted in the Reproductive and Child Health Programme in 2010 was maternal death review. Analysis of the progress so far has brought to light certain gaps which have prompted the paradigm shift toward Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR), which focuses on taking action on information obtained from every maternal death so as to prevent further maternal deaths. The new guidelines on MDSR were released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2017.","346":"Social capital has been recognized as part of the WHO's Social Determinants of Health model given that social connections and relationships may serve as resources of information and tangible support. While the association between socioeconomic position and health is relatively well established, scant empirical research has been conducted in developing countries on the association between social capital and health. Based on the WHO's Social Determinants of Health framework, we tested whether social capital mediates the effect of socioeconomic position on mental and physical health. A population-based study was conducted among a representative sample (n = 1563) of men and women in Chandigarh, India. We used standardized scales for measuring social capital (mediator variable) and self-rated mental and physical health (outcome variable). A socioeconomic position index (independent variable) was computed from education, occupation, and caste categories. Mediation model was tested using path analysis in IBM SPSS-Amos. Participants' mean age was 40.1 years. About half of the participants were women (49.3%), and most were relatively well educated. The results showed that socioeconomic position was a significant predictor of physical and mental health. Social capital was a significant mediator of the effect of socioeconomic position on mental health but not physical health. Besides removing socioeconomic barriers through poverty alleviation programs, interventions to improve social capital, especially in economically disadvantaged communities, may help in improving population health. ","347":"In India, more than half of the pregnant women suffer from anemia. Low compliance to iron supplementation is one of the important reasons. The objective of the study is to estimate the reduction in the prevalence of anemia, improvement in iron status, and to compare the compliance to oral iron supplementation during pregnancy between directly observed iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation group and control group. This was a community-based open labeled parallel block-randomized controlled trial including 400 pregnant women in a rural setting of north India. In the intervention group, the first dose of IFA every week was supervised by ASHA and women were instructed to take the remaining tablets during the week as per the prescription. In control group, IFA tablets were supplemented without direct supervision. After 100 days of IFA supplementation, the reduction in anemia in the intervention group was 6% higher as compared to control group (P = 0.219). The increase in the mean hemoglobin level over and above control group was 0.52 g\/dl in intervention group (P &lt; 0.001). However, the mean increase in serum ferritin level in the intervention group was similar to the control group. The mean percentage compliance in the intervention group was almost 9% higher than that of control group (P = 0.001). Directly supervised oral iron (IFA) supplementation improves compliance to oral iron (IFA) supplementation and also improves hemoglobin status among pregnant women. However, the mean increase in serum ferritin and reduction in the prevalence of anemia in the intervention group were not higher than the control group. ","348":"Smokeless tobacco use in the Indian subcontinent is a part of many religious and cultural rituals and has gained a degree of social acceptance. The deleterious effects of smokeless tobacco are not as well-known as those produced by smoking. The study was carried out to assess the influence of tobacco chewing on the oral health of adult patients attending the dental outpatients department of Khordha district headquarter, Odisha. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 25-64-year-old patients attending the dental outpatient department of Gopabandhu Khordha district headquarter hospital. A total of 512 study participants, who were age and sex matched, were stratified into four age groups such as 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, and 55-64 years old. Oral health status of the participants was assessed using modified WHO Oral Health Assessment Form (2013). Pearson's Chi-square test, binary and multinomial logistic regression was performed to determine the relationship between oral health problems and tobacco chewing. Among the tobacco chewers, 59.8% had gingival bleeding, 40.6% had periodontal pockets, 30.1% had loss of attachment, 48.4% had attrition, and 4.3% had potentially malignant disorders. Compared to the nonchewers, these oral problems were significantly higher among the chewers. Whereas dental caries experience was significantly lower among the chewers (40.6%) compared to the nonchewers (54.7%). Compared to the nonchewers, chewers had 1.71 times increased odds for gingival bleeding, 1.71 times increased odds for periodontal pockets, 2.39 times increased odds for loss of attachment, and 2.49 times increased odds for attrition, which were statistically significant. Hence, the study revealed that tobacco chewing definitely had an influence on oral health, with statistically significant increase in oral health problems in chewers compared to nonchewers. Moreover, loss of attachment and potentially malignant disorders increased significantly with the frequency of tobacco chewing. Periodontal pockets, attrition, and loss of attachment significantly increased with the duration of the chewing habit. ","349":"Body mass index (BMI) is one of the most commonly used indices to measure the weight status of an individual. However, it takes only height and weight of individual into account. The relative body composition can be calculated regardless of height and weight by body fat percentage (BF%). The objectives of the study are (1) To assess the prevalence of obesity using BMI and BF% among early adolescents studying in schools of Dibrugarh. (2) To assess the relationship between BMI and BF%. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 1200 school going adolescents of 10-14 years in Dibrugarh town for 1 year. Weight status was assessed using the World Health Organization-2007 reference for BMI and the McCarthy's body fat reference. Data were presented using percentages and mean with standard deviation. The correlation between the anthropometric variables was calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Kappa statistics was used to analyze the agreement. Total participants included in the analysis were 1096 with a response rate of 91.3%. The prevalence of overweight and obesity by BMI was 20.9% and 10.2%, respectively. According to BF%, overweight was present in 16.4% participants and 10.9% were obese. Of the 625 normal weight participants (according to their BMI), 9.0% were overweight and 1% were obese under BF% criteria. Again, of 682 participants who were normal by BF%, 15.2% were categorized as obese by BMI criteria. BMI and BF% had a significant high positive correlation (r = 0.70 and P &lt; 0.001). The measurement of agreement by Kappa statistics was 0.621 which was significant (P &lt; 0.001). BMI and BF% positively correlate with each other. BMI accompanied by BF% in the studies might give a better picture of the adiposity of an adolescent. ","350":null,"351":"Unintentional injuries have become a major noncommunicable disease burden, especially among the adolescents. The current study was conducted to estimate the effect of different aspects of daily activities of adolescence for sustaining serious unintentional injuries in the past 1 year. A cross-sectional survey with multistage sampling with validated pretested questionnaire was done among the school-going adolescent boys in Kolkata. Poisson regression was used to model the counts of serious injuries. To account for the excess of zero in the outcome, zero-inflated Poisson regression was performed. Among the participants, 73.5% did not report any serious unintentional injury sustained in the past 1 year, 11.9% reported to have sustained serious unintentional injury once in the past 1 year, and rest had more than one count. Statistically significant higher chance of sustaining an episode of injury was found among frequent users of motorbike (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.183), frequently walking on roads (IRR: 1.910), and frequently crossing major roads on bicycle (IRR: 2.181) were observed. A statistically significant protective rate ratio was also obtained for those frequently obeying traffic signals while crossing roads (IRR: 0.493) and frequent users of bicycles (IRR: 0.384). Significantly lower rate ratio for sustaining a serious injury was observed with frequently getting into fight at home (IRR: 0.343) and getting beaten up at school (IRR: 0.595). The study revealed traveling in a car and obeying traffic rules were protective from sustaining serious injury. However, walking and participation in sports appeared to be risky, especially for sustaining another episode of serious injury. ","352":"In 2005, the Government of India implemented the National Rural Health Mission for reduction of maternal mortality. One of the major impediments in improving maternal health since then has been a poor management of the Health Management Information System (HMIS) at grass-roots level which could integrate data collection, processing, reporting, and use of information for necessary improvement of health services. The paper identifies the challenges in generating information for HMIS and its utilization for improvement of maternal health program in the tribal-dominated Jaleswar block in Odisha, India. It also aims to understand the nature and orientation of the HMIS data generated by the government for the year 2013-2014. The study is a cross-sectional type which used observation and interview methods. Primary data were gathered from health professionals to understand the challenges in generating information for HMIS and its utilization. Next, to understand the nature and orientation of HMIS, data pertaining to tribal block were analyzed. The findings show that there are challenges in generation of quality data, capacity building of workforce, and monitoring of vulnerable tribal population. The discrepancies between HMIS data and field reality display the gap in formulation of policy and its implementation. The study unearths the existing politics of knowledge generation. This shows highly standardized procedures and information gathering by use of dominant biomedical concepts of maternal health with limited inclusion of local birthing conceptions and needs of vulnerable tribal pregnant women. ","353":"Despite evidence regarding the beneficial effects of vaccines, vaccination uptake has not been up to the mark across the globe in various sociocultural and sociodemographic groups. Logistics and workforce have been issues of concern to public health managers, but the latent issue of vaccine hesitancy leading to vaccine delays and refusals has not been widely addressed particularly in the Indian context. The present study was conducted to find out the proportion and factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy for childhood vaccinations in slums of Siliguri, India. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 194, 0-59 months' children residing in slums of Siliguri in 2016. Data were collected at the household with interviews of mothers\/primary caregivers using a predesigned pretested interview schedule developed based on the validated version of vaccine hesitancy survey questionnaire originally developed by the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts working group on vaccine hesitancy. Associations were analyzed using logistic regression. Majority 161 (83%) of the families were vaccine-hesitant and only 33 (17%) were not hesitant. Nuclear families and mothers of lower educational status had significantly higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. Reluctance to vaccinate (26.1%) and to be unaware\/having no reliable information (20.5%) were the major reasons cited for vaccine hesitancy. Most of the families of the children were vaccine-hesitant in the area. Uniformity in schedules in different health facilities in slum areas, appropriate antenatal information, and counseling regarding childhood vaccinations, widespread awareness, and improving mothers' education can address the issue of vaccine hesitancy. ","354":"","355":"In humans, Pthirus pubis or crab louse usually infests hair of pubic region. Phthiriasis palpebrarum (infestation of the eyelashes and eyelids) is not as rare as is reported in literature, especially in low socioeconomic communities. It is possible that the disease is being perhaps missed due to its clinical similarity with anterior blepharitis. The nits and adult lice adhering to the eyelashes can easily be overlooked. This study presents five cases of phthiriasis palpebrarum, coming from the same locality and socioeconomic background, presenting with itching, hyperemia of lids, and excoriation of skin. Two patients were misdiagnosed elsewhere. All were successfully treated. The presence of P. pubis reflects the low level of health and hygiene of that stratum of the society. Higher prevalence could be related to rapid urbanization, overcrowding, and extreme poverty. The health-care providers and policymakers should give more merit to this not so uncommon disease having high morbidity.","356":"Near-miss obstetric events (NMEs) refers to the situations where women experience severe, life-threatening obstetric complications during pregnancy, delivery, or postpregnancy (up to 42 days) which they survive either by chance or because they receive good care at a facility. A cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June 2016 at the subdivisional hospital of West Bengal. The WHO near-miss criteria were followed for case identification. Data were collected by interview and record review. No maternal deaths were reported during data collection period; however, the frequency of NMEs was quite high (38%). Maternal near-miss ratio was 379.51\/1000 live births, and maternal mortality index was 0%. Higher age group, below poverty line status, term pregnancy, and higher gravid and higher parity significantly favored the occurrence of NMEs, while ANC registration and Iron and Folic Acid consumption were significantly protective against it. Early identification of risk factors for NMEs and prompt initiation of treatment plays a critical role in the management of NMEs.","357":"Up to 25% of hepatitis E virus (HEV)-infected pregnant women in their third trimester die. Despite HEV being an important cause of viral hepatitis, no robust surveillance exists in India. We reviewed jaundice outbreaks records and hospital records from jaundiced individuals seeking treatment and linked those records to laboratory results (HEV immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for January 2012 to September 2013 in Odisha state. A total of 14 HEV confirmed outbreaks were identified, of which 33% of 139 jaundiced cases were HEV positive. There were two deaths. An additional 495 jaundiced cases were identified through hospital records, of which 18% were HEV positive. Among HEV-positive women (n = 35), 34% were of childbearing age. While one may not be able to generalize our results, this finding suggests HE is widespread in Odisha and may represent hidden disease burden in this region. The policymakers should monitor HEV infections in similar geographical areas, especially among population of childbearing age women to initiate evidence-based control measures.","358":"Safe drinking water is a basic element of primary health care. The government of India in its Indian Public Health Standards recommends the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) strip test as a desirable component at primary health centers for screening water for fecal coliforms. The objective of the present study was to conduct a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) survey followed by a H2S strip test of drinking water in a village with ninety households. The test was positive in 88% at the source and the point of consumption, with 100% concordance between both the points of test. A subsample of water samples was subjected to testing in microbiology laboratory, and fecal contamination was confirmed in all of them. To conclude, H2S strip test can be conveniently used at field level, and its ease of use and visual nature of results make it a useful point-of-care test of environmental and public health.","359":"Limited availability of randomized control trial warranted the conduct of a present study to demonstrate the effectiveness of mobile phone-based short message services (SMSs) on reduction in mean fasting blood glucose (FBG) in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 955 patients were recruited from primary and secondary health-care facilities and randomized to intervention (479) and control (476) group. Messages were delivered to patients for 12 months tailoring to their recent FBG values. SMS included information to maintain the desired FBG levels and next due date for FBG assessment. Patients were statistically similar for their age, socioeconomic status, smoking, and alcohol use. After the intervention, an average FBG declined from 163.7 to 152.8 mg\/dl (P = 0.019) in intervention and from 150.5 to 149.2 mg\/dl (P = 0.859) in control group. Adjusted for the baseline FBG, the intervention was found to be significantly effective (odds ratio: 1.7; 95 confidence interval: 1.2-2.6).","360":"There is a constant rise in cancer cases, but the trends and pattern vary according to the geographical region. The aim of this brief research was to present an update of all cancer incidences through age-adjusted rates and their changes in different regions of the country. The data for this study were obtained from published reports of 28 population-based cancer registries (2005-2014) in India. Among males, currently, East\/Northeast region ranked first, on the basis of incidence of cancer cases. Out of 28 registries, 11 registries encountered lung cancer as the leading site. Currently, East\/Northeast regions were ranked first on the basis of incidence of cancer cases among females. Our study showed that 20 registries among the 28 had breast cancer as the leading one. Thus, the present overview revealed that all cancers in both males and females are consistent and had a high incidence in East\/Northeast region of the country.","361":"Alcoholism is one of the major health problems seen all over the world. The risk of relapse was estimated among 94 clients with alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS) who attended both in- and out-patient units of a tertiary care hospital. The tools used were the sociodemographic and clinical variables, Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol-revised (CIWA-Ar), Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), and Advanced Warning of Relapse (AWARE) scale. Out of the 94 clients, 63 (67.7%) were in the low-risk group for getting relapse, 26 (27.7%) were in the moderate-risk group, and 5 (5.3%) were in the high-risk group. Family history of alcohol use was significantly associated with the AWARE score (P &lt; 0.05). Nicotine use was reported by 56 (59.6%) clients. Clients with a positive family history of alcohol use, disturbed sleep pattern, and higher total score (&gt;20) of AUDIT scale were at higher risk of relapse.","362":"Urban population in our country has increased at an annual rate of 2.7% during the last decade and it is estimated that by 2031, there would be about 600 million people living in urban India. The fast pace of urbanization has come to stay with increasing proportion of urban poor and vulnerable with health indicators much worse than their rural counterparts. The need to provide health care to urban poor has been emphasized in the past in various health committees' reports and National 5-year Development Plans, but no significant dent was made to improve the urban health scenario of the country. The National Urban Health Mission launched in May 2013 provides us a concrete mechanism to address special health needs of urban population with focus on urban poor. There is a strong need to set up primary healthcare system in urban areas and systematically deal with urban health challenges in terms of vector-borne diseases, rising incidence of noncommunicable diseases, air pollution and acute respiratory infections, road traffic accidents, trauma, and injuries. The initiatives to address these challenges do not remain confined to health sector alone but also need to be supported by sectors other than health such as social welfare, women and child development, road transport and highways, school education, drinking water, and sanitation. We really need to address wider and social determinants of health to effectively improve the urban health scenario.","363":"The burden of surgical conditions is large, though unrecognized. Surgical interventions are cost - effective, but thought to be otherwise. Investments aimed at including surgery at primary care level are affordable. Globally, a momentum is being created to strengthen surgery infrastructure especially for the poor in the low and middle income countries - who bear the burden most. In India, the Association of Rural Surgeons of India, and a body for implementing Lancet Commission of Global Surgery, India are taking lead. A blue print of activities needed to bring surgery on the centre stage of public health in India has been developed. The IPHA can play a catalytic role and use its convening power in getting various associations of public health professionals in India to partner surgeons in this effort. Integration of surgery in public health has the potential to improve equity, access, and universal health coverage.","364":"Problematic Internet use (PIU) among students has become a significant mental health concern. Our goals were to review the existing studies on problematic Internet from Southeast Asian Region and examine: the prevalence for PIU among students; explore for sociodemographic and clinical correlates; and assess the physical, mental, and psychosocial impact of PIU in this population. All studies conducted among population of the Southeast Asia, involving students (school students to postgraduate students) of any age which explored etiological factors and\/or the prevalence or any other factor associated with PIU\/Internet addiction were considered eligible for the present review. The electronic databases of PubMed and Google Scholar were systematically searched for the relevant published studies up to and including October 2016. Our search strategy yielded 549 articles, 295 of which were eligible for screening based on their publication in English language in a peer-reviewed journal. Of these, a total of 38 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.

Its magnitude and pattern reportedly vary over time and across geographical locations. The objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of CAs in community development block RS Pura of District Jammu. The present study is a community-based prospective study. The field workers were trained with the help of \"Birth Defect Surveillance\" Atlas issued by WHO and ICBDMS (International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Monitoring Systems) 2014. Pregnant women (registered or unregistered) with all health institutions in RS Pura Block on or after April 1, 2014, were followed till September 2015 for the ascertainment of CAs. All CAs detected during antenatal period (by ultrasonography), after delivery and abortion at any site were counted as events and classified by organ system according to the 10th version of the WHO International Classification of Diseases-10. A total of 1670 mothers were followed till their pregnancy outcome was recorded. Among 1600 live births recorded, 54 babies had CAs resulting in the incidence rate of 33.7\/1000 live births. The incidence rate was comparatively higher among women aged &lt;20 years (71.4\/1000 live births) and with Para 4 (43.5\/1000 live births) as compared to other women. Digestive system was the most common system involved (35%) followed by the Central nervous system (26.6%). The U-shaped pattern in the incidence of CAs with regards to parity and maternal age was observed. The study demonstrated that the CAs continue to occur in Jammu at a similar magnitude as reported from other parts of the country.

Indoor air pollution (IAP) means the presence of unwanted substances in the indoor air at concentration toxic to health. The objective of this study is to study the presence of IAP, its associated factors and impact on health of women residing in an urban slum of Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It was a cross-sectional study done from January 2017 to March 2017 among 120 households of a slum. Data were collected using a pre-designed pre-tested schedule from the homemaker of the households. All analyses were conducted with R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. About 60% households used kerosene as cooking fuel predominantly. Smoke from the neighbouring houses troubled 57.5% respondents. More than 60% houses were overcrowded and more than 70% houses were poorly ventilated. IAP-related symptoms such as irritation in the eye, suffocation, dry cough significantly correlated with the presence of IAP sources and its contributory factors. Of 120, 78 (65%) perceived the presence of IAP in their houses. Lower per capita income (PCI), ground floor, and joint family were found to have higher odds of sources of IAP. Younger age, lower PCI, and ground floor were found to be strongly associated with higher contributory factors of IAP. The present study found that the majority of the households were exposed to IAP due to kerosene, neighborhood smoke while overcrowding and ill-ventilation accentuated it. Effective intervention with intersectoral coordination is the need of the hour. ","368":"Vitamin D deficiency\/Vitamin D Insufficiency (VDI) is now recognized as a pandemic. Cutaneous exposure to ultraviolet-B causes photolysis of epidermal 7-dehydrocholesterol, converting it to pre-Vitamin D3 (precholecalciferol), which then undergoes isomerization to form the stable hormone Vitamin D3. The objectives of the study is to determine the status of Vitamin D level among the adults residing in a rural area of West Bengal and to find out the optimal cutoff of the sun exposure for Vitamin D sufficiency. This study was a rural community based cross-sectional study. It was done from May 2016 to April 2017 among 197 adults residing in a rural block of West Bengal. Data were collected by interviewing the respondents with the help of a structured pre-tested pre-designed schedule. After interviewing, every individual was examined for height and weight and blood was collected for serum Vitamin 25-(OH) D. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to find out optimum cut-off for sun exposure using Youden's index. Binary logistic regression was performed to find out the associates of high sun exposure. All analysis was done using R. Overall VDI was found in 133 (67.5%). Among them, 102 (51.8%) were female. On ROC curve for veritable sun exposure for Vitamin D sufficiency, area under curve was 0.7841 which signifies veritable sun exposure as a good screening tool. Proper information, education, and communication material regarding various aspects of sun exposure and Vitamin D should be prepared with due consultation of field experts and disseminated to increase awareness among the community.

Conventionally, inadequate public healthcare financing and the lack of skilled human resources are considered as the major barriers towards achieving UHC in India. To strengthen the Indian healthcare system, there has been significant increase budgetary allocation towards healthcare, a national health protection scheme targeting low-income households, upgrading of primary health-care and expansion of the health work-force. Nevertheless, an evolving paradigm for improving holistic health, sanitation, nutrition, gender equity, drug accessibility and affordability, innovative initiatives in national health programs for reduction of maternal deaths, tuberculosis and HIV burden and the utilization of information technology in healthcare provision of the underserved and the marginalized is gaining rapid acceleration. These represent a genuine innovation towards fulfillment of UHC goals for India.","371":"","372":"Anthropometric changes take place with increasing age. Progressive loss of height makes it difficult to use height for calculation of body mass index in nutritional screening of elderly persons. There is a need to find other alternative methods which could be used as proxy measurements of height in them. To assess the relationship of height and arm span and among elderly persons. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among elderly persons in urban colony of Delhi. Height and arm span of persons aged 60 years and above (n = 711) were measured according to standard methods. Correlation between arm span and height was calculated. The mean arm span was seen to be more than the mean height in all age-groups and both sexes. There was a linear relationship between height and arm-span in all age-groups. There was a strong correlation between arm span and height in all age groups. Arm span could be used instead of height as an alternative in the conventional body mass index in elderly persons.","373":"This cross-sectional study was carried out to assess drug prescribing pattern at a tertiary care teaching medical institute. One thousand prescriptions were randomly collected and analyzed using the world health organization prescribing indicators. The average number of drugs per prescription was 2.91.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity among girls was 9.76% and 1.22%; and among boys, it was 10.97% and 3.23%, respectively. Overweight and obesity were more common among boys as compared to girls under the age of 13 years but trend changed afterwards. Lower prevalence of overweight and obesity found in our study could be because of availability of healthful environment in schools.","375":"As the adage, \"Garbage in, Garbage out\" goes, data entry errors may lead to erroneous results and conclusions. Quality assurance during data entry is one of the most neglected components of research and is conspicuously missing in most of the reporting standards. In this study, we reviewed research studies published in Indian Journal of Public Health and Indian Journal of Community Medicine during 2014-2016 and determined the proportion of papers reporting on quality assurance during data entry. Of 110 papers, only 6 (5.5%) papers explicitly included a statement about data quality assurance, with two studies reported to have performed double entry and validation, considered the gold standard in quality-assurance of data entry. This is highly unacceptable. We hereby appeal to the community of researchers, peer reviewers, and journal editors in India to pay attention to this important aspect of research and make reporting of quality assurance of data entry mandatory in every published paper.","376":"Compared to adults, assessment of dietary intake of school children has always been a great challenge in public health practice.

Data were analyzed from a total of 1,885,207 ANC attendees recruited at ANC sites. The consistent sites were grouped by years of initiation (Group 1: 2003-2005 and Group 2: 2006-2008) and according to six regions. Chi-square test for linear trend was applied to test the statistical significance of the trend. Nationally, at Group 1 sites, HIV prevalence was 0.93% in 2003, which declined to 0.36% in 2015 (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, at Group 2 sites, prevalence ranged from 0.25% to 0.23% during 2006-2015 (P &gt; 0.05). The findings suggest that HIV is conclusively declining at old sites, nationally as well as in most of the other regions but increasing in the northern region. At newer sites, the conclusive declining trend is evident only in the southern region. National AIDS response must consider these variations to allow locally appropriate responses to the epidemic.","379":"Obesity and hyperuricemia are the precipitating factors of multiple disease processes. Studies on the relationship between obesity and hyperuricemia in Thai adolescents are limited. The objective is to investigate the gender differences in obesity and serum uric acid as well as the relationship between obesity and serum uric acid levels in secondary school-age students. A cross-sectional study conducted among 689 secondary school-age students; 313 boys and 376 girls. Body composition and fasting serum uric acid were assessed. This study defined hyperuricemia as serum uric acid &gt;6 mg\/dL in girls and &gt;7 mg\/dL in boys. By body mass index (BMI) for age and percentage of body fat classification, the prevalences of obesity were 11.5% and 9.0%, respectively. Prevalence of obesity by BMI for age, 15.3% and percentage of body fat, 12.4% in boys were statistically significantly higher than those in girls, 8.2% and 6.1%, respectively. Boys in all age groups had statistically significantly higher serum uric acid levels than those in girls as well as serum uric acid levels at late adolescent period in both sexes were statistically significantly higher than those at early adolescent period. On multivariate analysis, the demographic factors studied showed that boys, late adolescence period, and excess body fat adolescents had higher prevalence of hyperuricemia in secondary school-age students who have their birthplace in 8 provinces of Northern Thailand. This indicated that early nutritional management and encourage obese adolescents to weight and serum uric acid reductions are important for the prevention of diet-related chronic diseases in their adult period.

Section 4 of Indian legislation, Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, prohibits smoking at public places, thus protecting people from SHS. The objective of present study was to assess the exposure to SHS at home and working areas in Punjab, India. The present cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2015 to March 2016. A three-stage sampling technique was used for collecting data from three randomly selected districts representing three major regions of Punjab, India. A sample size of 510 individuals was divided equally into an urban and rural area with proportionate sampling on the basis of subsets of age groups and gender. The questionnaire based on tobacco questions for the survey, a subset of key questions from global adult tobacco survey was used. At home, the odds of exposure to SHS exposure was higher (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-7.3) in urban area, females, low educational status, and nongovernment employee as compared to their counterparts. At workplace, (OR = 3.9 and 95% CI = 1.11-14.3) SHS exposure was higher in rural area, among males, primary and middle education and nongovernment or self-employed occupation. SHS exposure was low in Punjab, India especially in females as compared to other states of the country. The socio-economic disadvantaged groups and people with low education were more likely to experience exposure to SHS at workplace, which should be targeted to reduce tobacco consumption. ","381":"The right to health is a fundamental part of human rights. Ensuring right to health is not straightforward; there are several challenges. Factors such as capacity of right holders and duty-bearers and practices of providing and utilizing services among others determine to ensure health rights for the whole population. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the health policies and programs follow a human rights-based approach (HRBA) and assess the situation of rights to health among the poor and vulnerable population. The study assessed domestic instruments against human rights policies and analyzed the implementation status of the policies and programs. An analytical case study method is used by utilizing qualitative and quantitative data. Around 90% medicines are available in the facilities; however, 22% of health worker posts are vacant. Persistence of unequal distribution of health facilities, high out-of-pocket payment, and cultural and language barriers does not ensure accessibility of health services. Acceptability of health-care services in terms of utilization rate and client satisfaction is improved after introduction of new policy. Nepal has made significant progress in improving maternal mortality ratio, infant\/child mortality, immunization rates, and life expectancy at birth. Although a progressive realization of the right to health is being achieved, more efforts are still needed to follow HRBA so as to achieve quality and equity in health-care services.

It is an important determinant of short- and long-term morbidities in infants and children. Unfortunately, risk factors of majority of preterm births (PTBs) remain unexplained which calls for appropriate action. There is a dearth of community-based research on PTB and its risk factors, especially in high burden countries like India. The objective of the study was to explore different risk factors for PTB. A cohort of 1977 antenatal mothers was enrolled at household level by trained field investigators and was followed up in four districts of Gujarat, India, to document the outcome of pregnancy. Pretested and structured questionnaires were used to collect information. A hierarchical regression model was used to analyze the risk factors for PTB. Proportion of PTB was 9% among the enrolled cohort. Risk factors which were found to be significant on applying the hierarchical model were periodontal disease, long sleep duration, and sex during any trimester. The study suggests an urgent need for strengthening of existing guidelines for effective, evidence-based, and culturally appropriate interventions for prevention of PTB. Maintenance of good oral hygiene should find a place in routine recommendations for pregnant women, and antenatal examinations should include screening for oral hygiene also.

","388":"Bangladesh has been struggling to reduce the prevalence of childhood undernutrition, which impedes physical and mental capability and accelerates morbidity and mortality. The objective of the paper is to examine the changes over time in the association between potential covariates and nutritional status of Bangladeshi children. The study combined and analyzed data from six waves of Demographic and Health Surveys between 1997 and 2014. Multivariable binary logistic regression models have been fitted to data from individual waves. Overall association has been investigated using forest plots, and meta-regression has been utilized to assess the pace of change in the association over time. Parental education and place of residence showed a consistent association with nutritional status of children. Children from parents with no little education were more likely to be undernourished than those from parents with secondary or higher level of education (odds ratio [OR] in 1997 = 3.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.65-4.22, OR in 2004 = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.58-2.37). On the other hand, gaps in the association of wealth and childhood nutrition have been widening consistently so that in 2014 children from households from the lowest 40% wealth category were 2.66 times (OR = 2.66, 95% CI = 2.13-3.33) as likely as to be undernourished than those from upper 20%. The findings have policy implications in terms of developing programs directed to mothers with a relatively poor socioeconomic background. A specific example would be providing nutritional education in relation to importance of childhood nutrition or cheaper nutritious food.

The objective of this study is to find out the role of work-related perceived stress on burnout and influence of EI on it. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April 2016 among 63 resident doctors of different departments of Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire for background characteristics and work-related variables. Cohen perceived stress scale, Trait EI, and Shirom-Melamed burnout questionnaire were applied for measuring perceived stress, EI, and burnout, respectively. Statistical analysis was done with of SPSS version 22.0, and for mediation analysis, Andrew F. Hyne's SPSS macro was adopted. Nonparametric bootstrapping was done assuming small sample. Out of complete responses, 67%, 22.9%, and 9.8% were from clinical, paraclinical, and preclinical specialties, respectively. Burnout had a significant positive correlation with perceived stress and in negative correlation with EI-well-being and positive correlation with EI-self-control and sociability. Physical fatigue factor of burnout had a significant positive correlation with EI-emotionality. Perceived stress had a negative correlation with EI-well-being. On mediation analysis, assuming EI as a mediator, total, direct, and indirect effects of perceived stress on burnout were significant (&lt;0.05). Mediation was proved to act with percent mediation of 0.07. There was definite mitigating effect of EI on burnout by perceived stress among resident doctors. This necessitates more attention by decision-makers toward this burning problem for the sake of care of caregivers. ","402":"Increasing antisocial and violent behaviors in adolescents and young adults present serious challenges for public health. Children with persistent high levels of aggressiveness are often associated with developing conduct disorders later in life. Early detection of highly aggressive children and sociodemographic risk-modifying factors are important for developing effective preventive strategies. The present study was undertaken to assess levels of aggressiveness for detecting highly aggressive children in sample populations of primary school children in an urban setting and determine significant biosociocultural risk-modifying factors in this scenario. The study was conducted during August-September, 2015 in 5 primary schools of South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Sociodemographic data on 2080 students were collected. Overall aggressiveness scores (OA-Scores) were estimated using a self-report questionnaire in Hindi. Categorizing students according to their OA-Scores, the data revealed that highly aggressive children constituted 4.3% of the study population. Analysis showed significant influence of (a) gender: boys displayed higher levels of aggressiveness compared to girls; (b) dietary pattern: omnivores showed higher aggressiveness than vegetarians; and (c) school environment: boys in mixed-sex (coeducational) schools displayed lower aggressiveness than from single-sex schools. Statistically significant influences of religion (Hindu\/Muslim) and family type (joint\/nuclear) on aggressiveness profiles were not noticeable. Vegetarian diets and mixed-sex education act as protective factors in the development of aggressiveness in children, especially among boys. Extending investigations to populations differing in geography and cultural backgrounds are warranted to verify present results.

Though there are many factors responsible for injury in the home, the environment plays an important role. The objectives were to study the magnitude and pattern of home injuries in children aged 0-14 years and to assess the environmental risk associated with home injuries. A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015 in a ward of Mehrauli containing 20,800 households, and the total sample of children was selected from 400 households by systematic random sampling, with sampling interval being 52. Information was taken using a predesigned, semi-structured, pretested proforma from both the parents and children. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS version 12. The prevalence of home injury was found to be 39.7% in the last 1 year, significantly higher in the age group of 1-3 years (54.3%) followed by 5-10 years (45.1%) (P = 0.000). The total number of injuries and the average number of injuries in girls were significantly higher than those of boys. The most common type of home injury was falls (59.5%) followed by injury with sharps and burn injury. The environmental risk was assessed using standard and working definitions and found unsafe electrical points (95.3%), unsafe stairs (100%), unsafe kitchen with access to sharps (29.3%), access to active fire (19.3%), and unsafe furniture and objects (22.8%). Though home injury did not occur in 60% of the children during the study period, the risk of injury in the future is high.

A cross-sectional mix method study was conducted in the year 2015 in all 22 VHSNCs of Chandigarh. The data of VHSNCs' members were obtained using interview schedule and in-depth interview checklist, while record review checklist was used to assess functioning of VHSNCs. A scoring sheet was developed based on sociodemographic profile, public services monitoring, training status, untied funds utilization, and regularity of monthly meetings. The comparison of VHSNC indicators was done between villages under Panchayat and Municipal Corporation (MC). Most VHSNCs' members are trained (except medical officers) and had their joint bank account (95.4%). Maximum fund is utilized for administrative purposes, leaving less for health and nutrition-related activities. Most villages (68.9%) got 25-30 score depicting that implementation status of VHSNCs under these villages is \"promising,\" while one and six villages were \"low performing\" and \"good performing,\" respectively. Public service monitoring indicator's implementation was better in villages under Panchayat as compared to those under MC.

However, there is no published literature on inpatient waiting time before elective surgical procedures. This study aims to measure the inpatient waiting time, identify the factors that affect the inpatient waiting time, and recommend the ways of reducing the waiting time of inpatients before elective surgical procedures, at a state government teaching hospital in India. Descriptive research methods and quality control tools were used for this prospective observational study. Descriptive statistics, Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used. Pareto charts were used to highlight the most important modifiable factors among the set of factors causing increased waiting time. We also applied the M\/M\/c model (Erlang - A model) of queue theory to analyze the traffic intensity and system congestion. The median waiting time of inpatients before elective surgery was 12 days (interquartile range = 11.5 days). The waiting time was influenced significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by the patient's age, physical status, and the financial status. The surgical specialty, blood product booking and procurement, cross-specialty consultation before surgery, and Intensive Care Unit booking were the other important factors.

The objective of the study was to examine the incidence and pattern of morbidities among HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) Nigerian infants and determine any relationship with infant feeding methods. A review of the hospital records of all HEU infants attending the Virology Clinic of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Nigeria, between July 2013 and June 2015, was done. The recorded data included biodemographic profile, social parameters, feeding methods, anthropometry, and morbidities. The feeding method groups were statistically compared in relation to the various morbidities. Out of 119 children, 81.5% were exclusively breastfed, whereas 18.5% had exclusive breast milk substitute feeding. About half had various morbidities which included upper airway infections (UAIs) (16.8%), malaria (15.9%), malnutrition (8.4%), diarrhea (8.4%), and pneumonia (2.5%). The frequencies of these conditions were similar among infant groups irrespective of feeding method. The infants with and without morbidities were comparable in terms of the frequency of exclusive breastfeeding (80.3% vs. 82.8%). Low family socioeconomic status (SES) (odds ratio [OR] = 7.7) and ARV use (OR = 0.4) among infants were predictors of morbidities among HEU infants. The incidence and pattern of morbidities among HEU infants showed no relation to the mode of feeding.

These figures highlighted the fact that India already faces a dual burden of chronic malnutrition, i.e., obesity, besides undernutrition. Higher BMI, especially, increased abdominal fat is an important determinant of the development of diabetes. This study aims to understand the effect of health education on obesity status of adult women above the age of 20 years in an urban slum area. Community-based, interventional study, to assess select epidemiological factors associated with obesity-including measurement of anthropometry and assessing random blood sugar level; followed by an intervention (health education to only obese women by means of flip-chart); followed by a follow-up 6 months later. About 22.6% women were found to be obese. Almost, all dietary and physical activity parameters as well as weight improved for the better after the intervention, and the change was statistically significant.

A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among 796 slum households in Siliguri from January to March 2016 by interviewing one member from each household using a predesigned and pretested questionnaire based on the WHO\/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program Core questions on drinking water and sanitation for household surveys. A majority 733 (92.1%) of slum households used an improved drinking water source; 565 (71%) used public tap. About two-thirds (65.7%) household used improved sanitation facilities. About 15.8% households had reported diarrheal events in children in the previous month. Unimproved drinking water sources (AOR = 4.13; 1.91, 8.96), houses without piped water supply (AOR = 4.43; 1.31, 15.00), and latrines located outside houses (AOR = 3.61; 1.44, 9.07) were significantly associated with the diarrheal events in children. The utilization of improved drinking water source was high but piped water connection and improved sanitary toilet used was low. Association between diarrheal events and type of drinking water sources and place of sanitation might suggest fecal contamination of water sources.

It is essential to estimate the cost of managing T2DM to the society, especially in developing countries. Economic studies of T2DM as a primary diagnosis would assist efficient health-care resource allocation for disease management. This study aims to measure the economic burden of T2DM as the primary diagnosis for hospitalization from provider's perspective. A retrospective prevalence-based costing study was conducted in a teaching hospital. Financial administrative data and inpatient medical records of patients with primary diagnosis (International Classification Disease-10 coding) E11 in the year 2013 were included in costing analysis. Average cost per episode of care and average cost per outpatient visit were calculated using gross direct costing allocation approach. Total admissions for T2DM as primary diagnosis in 2013 were 217 with total outpatient visits of 3214. Average cost per episode of care was RM 901.51 (US$ 286.20) and the average cost per outpatient visit was RM 641.02 (US$ 203.50) from provider's perspective. The annual economic burden of T2DM for hospitalized patients was RM 195,627.67 (US$ 62,104) and RM 2,061,520.32 (US$ 654,450) for those being treated in the outpatient setting. Economic burden to provide T2DM care was higher in the outpatient setting due to the higher utilization of the health-care service in this setting. Thus, more focus toward improving T2DM outpatient service could mitigate further increase in health-care cost from this chronic disease. ","423":"In November 2015, death due to fever and increased number of fever cases were reported from Baranagar Municipality of North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. The episode was investigated with the objective to (1) confirm the existence of an outbreak, (2) describe it in terms of time, place, and person, (3) determine the cause of outbreak, and (4) recommend control measures. Monthly incidence of dengue from 2012 to 2014 was calculated and compared with 2015 to confirm the outbreak. We used Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme definition and searched for suspect dengue cases going door-to-door in ward number one of Baranagar Municipality. Active case search was done in health facilities also. Information on date of onset, symptoms, sociodemographic, serological reports, and clinical outcome for suspected and confirmed dengue cases was collected.

The primary objective of our work was to ascertain whether the provision of nutritious meals through centralized kitchens improves the proportion of underweight and stunted children. We used a cluster trial with parallel intervention and control arms. The allocation ratio was 1:1 for participants in the intervention and control areas. The pilot was undertaken between 2015 and 2017. Tribal dominant Nashik and Palghar districts in Maharashtra were selected by the state government to implement the centralized kitchen plan. At the baseline, the percentage of underweight children in the intervention group was 36.9% and 31.9% in the control groups. The percentage of stunting in the intervention group was 30.0% and 38.2% in the control group. At the endline, 21.9% and 26.3% of the children were underweight. Both groups showed an improvement as compared to the baseline. However, the difference in reduction between the intervention and the control group was insignificant. Similarly, stunting also reduced to 12.9% and 14.6% in the intervention and control groups, respectively.

We selected 31 public and private secondary schools using random sampling based on probability proportional to school enrolment. In each school, we selected 1-3 classes (Grades 7-9) by random sampling. All students in these classes from 30 schools (one school declined) completed a self-administered standard questionnaire in the Thai language. The association between tobacco use and independent variables was examined using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Of 1876 students, 1721 were aged 13-15 years. Overall, 15% of students currently used tobacco; boys 21.8% and girls 8.1%. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking was 11.3%; 3.3% students currently used electronic cigarettes. Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) at home, school, and in enclosed public places was reported by 33.8%, 47.9%, and 38.6%, respectively. Among current smokers, 44% were not stopped from purchasing cigarettes despite being underage. Higher tobacco use was associated with being older, male, exposed to SHS, in possession of an object with a tobacco logo, and being offered a free tobacco product by a tobacco company. Tobacco and cigarette use among Thai students remains high. Underage current smokers have easy access to cigarettes. Urgent steps are needed to curb the access of youth to tobacco. ","431":"The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Article 5.3 requires governments to protect tobacco control policies from the commercial interest of the tobacco industry (TI). TI interference is the biggest barrier to implementing comprehensive tobacco control measures. This paper reviews the extent of the TI's interference in tobacco control policy development in three countries, Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia, and the governments' efforts to protect these policies. The paper draws on incidents of TI interference reported in the 2016 Tobacco Industry Interference Index: ASEAN Report on Implementation of the WHO FCTC Article 5.3. Base data were obtained through a questionnaire on twenty most commonly reported incidents of interference from the FCTC Article 5.3 Guidelines recommendations. A scoring system was developed. All three countries faced varying levels of TI interference. Thailand, though known for its stringent tobacco control measures, still faced interference while Myanmar remains vulnerable. Indonesia faced the highest industry interference which may explain why it is lagging behind in tobacco control and remains a nonparty to the WHO FCTC. The TI gains access to government officials through offers of technical assistance and its corporate social responsibility activities. Transparency in dealing with the TI is needed in all three countries. Most governments have not set up disclosure procedures when dealing with the TI. Outside the Department\/Ministry of Health, other departments remain unaware of Article 5.3, not utilizing its strength to regulate the TI.

To find the effectiveness of Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST)-based brief intervention for alcohol and tobacco in a primary health-care setting in Karnataka. This study was conducted in 2012 where one primary health center (PHC) in Karnataka was an intervention site and other the control site. One hundred patients each in both control and intervention PHCs took part in the study. In the control PHC, patients were administered the ASSIST questionnaire and given an information pamphlet on tobacco- and alcohol-related harm. In the intervention PHC, ASSIST-based brief intervention was provided for both tobacco and alcohol cessation. At the 3rd month, ASSIST questionnaire was re-administered to record their follow-up score. Chi-square test, paired t-test, and independent sample t-test were used for statistical analysis. Following the initial assessment and intervention, there was statistically significant reduction in mean ASSIST scores for tobacco in both the PHCs. For alcohol, though there was reduction in scores in both PHCs, it was statistically significant only in intervention PHC. There was also a significant reduction in the number of heavy alcohol users in the intervention PHC following assessment and intervention.

","433":"The Indian notion of \"Public Interest Litigation (PIL)\" represents a moral and humane process for providing justice to an individual or a group in matters relating to infringement of fundamental rights or denial of civil privileges. The goal of PIL in India is to counter governmental lawlessness, administrative deviance, and exploitation of disadvantaged groups by denying them their rights and entitlements. Although this paper selectively describes the use of the PIL mechanism for ensuring implementation of large graphic health warnings on packages of tobacco products in India, there is a sufficient published literature to corroborate the successful use of this mechanism in India in different tobacco control settings. In fact, over the years, this legal tool has allowed the tobacco control community in India, to extensively promote human rights approach to tobacco control. In the wake of growing interference of tobacco industry worldwide, this paper explores PIL as a potent and effective tool for claiming public health rights related to tobacco control. The PIL has considerable potential to be used for enforcement of tobacco control measures and for stopping tobacco industry from engaging in activities which are detrimental to the health of the people at large. It is important to continuously identify potential avenues through which lessons and recommendations pertaining to PIL could be incorporated into the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control implementation plans and guidelines, with special focus on different intercessional mechanisms that are available from time to time.

Information on SLT use among Bangladeshi people is inadequate for policymaking and implementing effective control measures. With the aim to identify the prevalence and trends of different SLT products, health and economic impacts, manufacture, and sale of and policies related to SLT in Bangladesh, we carried out a literature review, which involved literature search, data extraction, and synthesis. Evidence suggests that in Bangladesh, SLTs range from unprocessed to processed or manufactured products including Sada Pata, Zarda, Gul, and Khoinee. Over 27% of Bangladeshi adults aged 15 years and older use SLT in one form or other. SLT use is associated with age, sex, education, and socioeconomic status. SLT consumption has reportedly been associated with increased prevalence of heart diseases, stroke, and oral cancer and led to around 320,000 disability adjusted life years lost in Bangladesh in 2010. No cessation service is available for SLT users in public facilities. Compared to cigarettes, taxation on SLT remains low in Bangladesh. The amendment made in Tobacco Control Law in 2013 requires graphic health warnings to cover 50% of SLT packaging, ban on advertisement of SLT products, and restriction to sale to minors. However, implementation of the law is weak. As the use of SLT is culturally accepted in Bangladesh, culturally appropriate public awareness program is required to curb SLT use along with increased tax and cessation services.","435":"Nearly half of all male population and two in every five females in the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR) consume some form of tobacco. Preventing initiation among adolescents is critical for overall tobacco control. We assessed the trends in youth tobacco use and policies in SEAR. Data are used from school-based youth (Global Youth Tobacco Survey and global school student-based health survey) and adult (Global Adult Tobacco Survey, STEPS) tobacco surveys and the WHO Framework of Convention of Tobacco Control (FCTC) implementation database. More than 10% of 13-15-year-old adolescent students reported tobacco use in 8 out of 11 countries. The prevalence of smokeless tobacco exceeded that of cigarettes except in Indonesia, Thailand, and Timor-Leste. No consistent declining trends in tobacco use were observed in any of the countries with 3 or more data points. More than half of all daily smokers aged 20-34 years initiated \"daily\" smoking before 20 years of age. 19% (Bangladesh) to 55% (Timor-Leste) of 13-17-year old students tried their first cigarette before their 14th birthday. Majority of adolescent students in most of the SEAR countries reported purchasing their cigarettes from store\/shop\/vendor and as single sticks, with few exceptions and purchased them as \"single\" cigarette. There is a limited change in affordability of cigarettes in SEAR over time. Tobacco use remains high among youth in SEAR. Efforts should be strengthened to fully implement\/enforce recommended policy measures (legal minimum age, fiscal measures to reduce tobacco affordability; prohibiting sale of single cigarettes, etc.) and to explore new measures (e.g., tobacco-free generation).","436":"Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are being marketed to tobacco smokers for use in places where smoking is not allowed or as aids similar to pharmaceutical nicotine products to help cigarette smokers quit tobacco use. These are often flavored to make them more attractive for youth - ENDS use may lead young nonsmokers to take up tobacco products. Neither safety nor efficacy as a cessation aid of ENDS has been scientifically demonstrated. The adverse health effects of secondhand aerosol cannot be ruled out. Weak regulation of these products might contribute to the expansion of the ENDS market - in which tobacco companies have a substantial stake - potentially renormalizing smoking habits and negating years of intense tobacco control campaigning. The current situation calls for galvanizing policy makers to gear up to this challenge in the Southeast Asia Region (SEAR) where the high burden of tobacco use is compounded by large proportion of young vulnerable population and limited established tobacco cessation facilities. Banning ENDS in the SEAR seems to be the most plausible approach at present. In the SEAR, Timor-Leste, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Thailand have taken the lead in banning these products. The other countries of the SEAR should follow suit. The SEAR countries may, however, choose to revise their strategy if unbiased scientific evidence emerges about efficacy of ENDS as a tobacco cessation aid. ENDS industry must show true motivation and willingness to develop and test ENDS as effective pharmaceutical tools in the regional context before asking for market authorization.","437":"South-East Asia Region (SEAR) has more smokeless tobacco users as compared to smokers. The growing prevalence and cultural acceptance of consumption of flavored areca nut and related products, for example, supari and pan masala in many countries are confounding the scenario. The prevalence of a variety of tobacco products makes regulation a challenge which gets more complicated in view of weak enforcement of regulatory policies aggressive marketing of such products by the tobacco industry. Some countries have attempted to regulate smokeless tobacco and related products by enforcing bans. However, limited evidence base along with lack of technical and regulatory capacities have restricted the SEAR countries to effectively implement product regulation in respect of smokeless tobacco and related products. This paper lays out specific priorities for research and need to enhance regulatory capacity for smokeless tobacco and processed areca nut in the SEAR countries. A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted to identify all original published literature related to regulating smokeless tobacco and processed areca nut. Studies reporting on the same were obtained through searches in relevant academic databases. Relevant World Health Organization (WHO) documents and reports on tobacco products regulation were consulted. Generating the right evidence along with the need to build the capacity of the countries to test the smokeless tobacco and processed areca nut products by establishing testing facilities and providing practical guidelines is of paramount importance. The countries of the SEAR need to prioritize the implementation of Articles 9 and 10 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to strengthen the regulation of smokeless tobacco and processed areca nut products.","438":"","439":"","440":"","441":"Parental perception of safe and risk-free environment is critical in the prevention of unintentional childhood injury. In this cross-sectional study, hundred mothers from 13 clusters were interviewed to assess the perception of mothers regarding the risks and hazards leading to unintentional childhood injuries from March to April 2013. A tool developed by Glik et al. was used. Mothers' perception of likelihood of injury from hazards such as household door and drawers, small toys, plastic bags, and cribs was poor. Mothers had a poor perception of injury by entrapment in refrigerators, choking, and strangulation by a rope. Age, education, and literacy (P &lt; 0.05) were found to be significant predictors of perception of risk and hazard. Very few mothers (9%) believed injuries can be completely prevented and illiteracy (P &lt; 0.05) was associated with poor perception on prevention. Health education should focus on improving maternal perception which may bring positive impact on prevention.","442":"Cardiometabolic health status of 356 women (age 25-65 years) from Tripuri tribal community of Tripura, a Northeastern state of India was evaluated. The height, weight, waist, hip circumference and blood pressure, blood sugar, total cholesterol, triglyceride; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were recorded. Cardiometabolic risk was assessed according to the recent definition for Asian Indians. The overall prevalence of cardiometabolic risk was found to be 27.24%. Postmenopausal women showed a higher prevalence of risk than premenopausal women. Central obesity was the most prevalent risk component among all the subjects. The urban population with high income and higher education level with sedentary lifestyle were more prone to cardiometabolic risk. The study revealed that a substantial proportion of ethnic Tripuri women are having prevalence of different cardiometabolic risk factors. The fact needs to be taken into consideration while considering strategies to mitigate noncommunicable disease burden of the population.","443":"Globally, alcohol has become the most common risk factor for death and disability in the young age group of 15-49 years. Its use has been rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is a critical time wherein if effective preventive measures are not undertaken urgently, damage done will be difficult to reverse. However, health professionals are not responding to the alcohol epidemic in the manner that they responded to the tobacco epidemic. The article discusses two beliefs which are making us accept the use of alcohol as normal. Recent evidence indicates that it is not advisable to drink alcohol even in moderation. Furthermore, social drinking has failed to decrease alcohol-related harm in western countries. Because of its addictive nature, many people end up drinking excessively though they do not intend to. Hence, we need to shift our focus from only \"reducing harmful use of alcohol\" to \"reducing use of alcohol\" in general.","444":"Growing smartphone usage among global and Indian college students has resulted in considerable issues of \"nomophobia\" (NMP) or feelings of discomfort or anxiety experienced by individuals whenever unable to use their smartphones. This significantly impacts their health, work, and study. The objective of this study is to find out the prevalence of NMP among smartphone using medical and engineering undergraduates of West Bengal and to compare the nomophobic behaviors, its predictors, and smartphone usage among them. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 303 medical and 305 engineering undergraduates in West Bengal using a validated NMP questionnaire consisting of four factors. Comparison of means of individual questions and factor scores was done. Nomophobic clusters among the two groups were identified using two-stage cluster analysis. Binary logistic regression was used for comparison of predictors of NMP. Engineering students showed a higher proportion of nomophobics (44.6%) than medical students (42.6%). Significant higher means was observed among engineering students for the factor \"giving upconvenience\" and individual variables like \"scared due to running out of battery,\" \"nervous due to disconnection from online identity,\" \"uncomfortable when unable stay up-to-date with social media\" and \"anxious when unable to check E-mails.\" A Higher proportion of nomophobics among both groups were females, those owning smartphone beyond 2 years, having monthly mobile bill above Rs. 200 and spending over 4 h daily on smartphone. NMP has emerged as a significant cause of concern among both the groups. Standardized measures for identification and appropriate psychobehavioral therapy for those seeking help might alleviate the problem. ","445":"Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is widespread, yet it is the most underdiagnosed and undertreated nutritional deficiency in the world. The prevalence of VDD is estimated to affect over 1 billion people worldwide. The present study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of VDD among adult females aged 20-60 years residing in a rural community of North India, and to find its association with various sociobehavioral risk factors. The present study is an analytical cross-sectional study conducted among females aged 20-60 years in rural Ballabgarh. Four hundred women were randomly selected from one of the villages of the Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Semi-structured, pretested interview schedule was administered to the study participants. Fasting venous blood sample was collected for the measurement of plasma sugar level and Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D). The prevalence of VDD was 90.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] - 87.5-93.3), while that of Vitamin D insufficiency was 8.9% (95% CI - 6.4-12.2). On logistic regression analysis, 24 h calorie intake, protein intake, and prediabetes status of the participants were significantly associated with VDD. Very high prevalence of VDD was observed among the females (20-60 years) residing in rural Ballabgarh.

To assess dietary patterns of 2-16-year-old children with special reference to calcium and suggest strategies and develop recipes suitable to identified patterns to increase dietary calcium intake. We studied 220 schoolchildren (2-16 years) around Pune city, India. The study duration was June 2013-July 2014. Height and weight were measured using standard protocols. Dietary intake was assessed by 24-h diet recall on 3 nonconsecutive days. Dietary patterns were derived by cluster analysis in two age groups; children (2-9 years) and adolescents (10-16 years). As per the dietary patterns, calcium-rich recipes were developed. Among children, \"rice-pulse\" (RP) and \"wheat, milk, and milk products\" (WM) patterns were observed. Among adolescents, RP, \"wheat, milk, and bakery\" (WMB), and \"mixed food\" patterns were observed. Children who consumed \"WM\" and \"WMB\" patterns had greater intake of calcium (P &lt; 0.05) than children consuming other dietary patterns. The daily calcium intake of whole group was 53% of the recommended dietary allowance. From this, 30% calcium came from milk. Each serve of the developed recipe provided an average of 254 mg of calcium. Majority of children had cereal-pulse-based dietary patterns. By replacing foods from existing dietary patterns with calcium-rich foods, the dietary calcium content may be increased in a sustainable manner. ","447":"The current belief of availability of doctors in India is based on the registration stock of doctors accumulated since the early 20th century. This has not been adjusted to attrition of the strength occurring due to retirement, emigration, etc. To estimate the number of practicing doctors currently available in India and will be available in 2030 after adjustments made for attrition of the stock. The paper used Medical Council of India's historical data (1960-2015) on registration stock of doctors obtained from the Indian medical registers available on its website and other data on emigration of doctors accessed from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and destination country sources. The paper found that there were only 4.8 practicing doctors per 10,000 population available in India in 2014, in contrast to the belief of having 7 doctors per 10,000 people. Rest of the registered doctors have either retired or emigrated from the country to practice abroad. It is estimated that the country would be able to achieve a ratio of about 6.9 practicing doctors per 10,000 people only by 2030. Given these findings of the current availability of doctors per 10,000 people and their growth prospects over the next 15-year period, it looks like an impossible task to achieve even a moderate doctor-population ratio of 1:1000 by 2030. Therefore, a genuine commitment to provide equitable healthcare to the rural population must innovate and experiment a special cadre of practitioners for rural areas on a pan-India basis. ","448":"The global resurgence of rickettsial diseases and their potential to impact the fitness of military personnel and inflict widespread casualties amongst civil populations has emerged as a major cause of public health concern. Absence of surveillance system, lack of awareness amongst medical fraternity to rickettsial activity along with the difficulty in diagnosis because of their protean clinical manifestations are reasons for the outbreaks of these diseases. To determine rickettsial activity amongst rodents and study vector diversity, abundance and their distribution to enable mapping of rickettsial hotspots. Zoonotic surveillance was undertaken in six selected study areas in India - Jammu, Akhnoor, Rajouri-Poonch, Udhampur-Nagrota, Dehradun and Pune. Weil-Felix test was used for rickettsial sero-surveillance amongst rodents and standard identification keys were used for mapping vector diversity and database preparation. Serological findings revealed positivity to all the three rickettsial antigens (OXK, OX19 and OX2) in Jammu, OX19 in Dehradun and OXK and OX2 positivity in Udhampur-Nagrota belt. The vector database records presence of 16 species of trombiculid mites from three important genera - Leptotrombidium, Schoengastiella and Gahrliepia with ticks from five genera and 8 species of fleas from four genera. Mite fauna of study sites has been enriched with addition of new records of mite species (five mite species at Pune, two at Akhnoor with one mite species each at Jammu and Dehradun). The study reveals rickettsial activity amongst rodents at Jammu, Dehradun and Udhampur-Nagrota belt. The results correlate well with the presence of vectors of scrub and tick typhus and corroborate the occurrence of outbreaks of these diseases in the respective areas. ","449":"The discourse of mental health is getting its due attention after all these years in India. A major threat to the mental health system is the demand side factors, namely, knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of the general population toward this. In spite of growing concern regarding mental health in India, this kind of study to assess the mental health status has been very few in India, more so in West Bengal. With this background, this study was carried out with the objectives to validate the Community Attitude to Mental Illness (CAMI), to assess the different sociodemographic factors among the study population, to assess the KAP regarding mental illness among the study population. It was an observational, descriptive study with cross-sectional design done at Amdanga Community Development Block, North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India, in 2015-16. Questionnaire validation to assess the KAP was the primary objective with obtaining the descriptive data were the second one. CAMI questionnaire was used which was validated for the given area by validation methods such as Cronbach's alpha and structural equation modeling. The resultant questionnaire was used in the field on adult population after a single-stage survey design to collect 730 samples. The test statistics showed that the questionnaire was reasonably valid after a few tweakings. SEM identified well-define domains in the attitude part. 94.9% says that they are willing to live with a people with mental illness. 14.9% has actually done so. Health-care seeking behavior shows that 19.2% will go to a GP in case of any mental illness. Furthermore, attitude toward mental illness showed mixed picture as also knowledge. This study correlated with various studies of developing countries and it was seen that these population showed markedly different attitudes for probability of the patients getting cured than many other countries. Furthermore, stigma was gradually decreasing, as evident from various other studies. This study will provide valuable insights into the cognitive and affective aspect of mental illness among these population and thus help in implementing better policies in this regard, as this is fast becoming the talk of the day. ","450":"Multisectoral approach (MSA) refers to deliberate collaboration among various stakeholder groups (e.g., government, civil society, and private sector) and sectors (e.g., health, environment, and economy) to jointly achieve a policy outcome. By engaging multiple sectors, partners can leverage knowledge, expertise, reach, and resources, benefiting from their combined and varied strengths as they work toward the shared goal of producing better health outcomes. Improving public health (PH) is challenging because of the size of its population and wide variation in geography. MSA help in addressing identified health issues in focused way as it helps in pooling the resources and formulating the common objectives. One of the major advantages is optimization of usage of resources by avoiding duplication of inputs and activities which tremendously improve program effectiveness and efficiency. Willingness at the leadership and mandate at the policy level are necessary to plan and execute the successful multisectoral coordination. All the major stakeholders require to share the common vision and perspective. Developing institutional mechanism is utmost requirement as it will standardize the processes of intersectoral coordination (ISC). Creation of PH cadre is strategic move to meet the major health challenges being faced by the health system, and it would be anchor of establishing systematic ISC. There are many national and international examples of MSA applications such as for malaria elimination, tobacco control, HIV\/AIDS prevention, Finland's community-based cardiovascular disease prevention project (North Karelia Project), and Singapore's Health Promotion Board. Promotion of MSA within the health system and with other ministries is seen as an important measure for effective implementation and improving efficiency.","451":"In spite of great efforts done by the Government of India to tackle the problem of malnutrition, proportion of population normal on nutrition scale has been stationary; nearly half of them have been a victim of under- and over-nutrition. Over a period, undernutrition has declined but this has been compensated by overnutrition. Hidden hunger is a still an unfinished agendum. The achievement of food grain security at the national level did not percolate down, and households' food insecurity and level of chronic food insecurity are still high. High economic growth rates have failed to improve food security in India. There is a need and scope for organizational, financial, and managerial reforms in this direction. The repercussion of malnutrition is not limited to physical deterioration, but it also affects the psychological level of victims.

Demographics, pattern of skin lightener use and incidence of side effects, perceptions of lighter skin tones were the main outcomes and measures studied. The use of skin lighteners was highly prevalent in our study population. Believing that lighter skin is beneficial for self-esteem is a predictor for skin lightener use. Higher education was associated with lower perceived benefits of fairer skin and therefore reduced skin lightener use. Further education and increased community awareness are important to address the issues surrounding potential over-use of skin-lightening products.","459":"Global health diplomacy (GHD) is relatively a very new field that has yet to be clearly defined and developed though there are various definitions given by different experts from foreign policy, global health, diplomacy, international relations, governance, and law. With the intensification of globalization and increasing gaps between countries, new and reemerging health threats such as HIV\/AIDS, tuberculosis, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and Zika and a gradual rethinking on security concepts framed a new political context. The health problems addressed diplomatically have also become diverse ranging from neglected tropical diseases, infectious diseases, sale of unsafe, counterfeit drugs to brain drain crisis. We see that global health has become more diverse as the actors widened and also the interests appealing not only to the traditional humanitarian ideals associated with health but also to the principles grounded in national and global security. Recently, we are witnessing the increased priority given to the GHD because the issue of health is discussed by various actors outside the WHO to shape the global policy for health determinants. In fact, the area of health has become the part of UN Summit Diplomacy involving the G8, G20, BRICS, and the EU.

Despite these advances, a large number of HIV-infected children are born in every year. A thorough literature review has been done by retrieving related studies (published from the year 2000 onward); using a Medline search and by extracting recent findings from the official websites of the National AIDS Control Organization, UNAIDS, UNICEF, and World Health Organization. The efforts that are made to control pediatric HIV are challenged by a large range of factors such as low health service utilization, poor drug adherence, delayed infant diagnosis, discriminatory attitude of health providers, loss to follow-up, and poor coordination in managing continuum of care. These challenges may be addressed by adopting innovative and effective strategies and strengthening the existing health system. This would bring about a significant reduction in pediatric HIV incidence and improve the outcomes in children who are HIV infected.","462":"Urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy is frequently associated with complications. Currently, in India, there is no regular screening for UTI, and facility for diagnosis of UTI is not available at peripheral government health centers. To estimate the proportion of pregnant women with UTI among antenatal clinic attendees in rural Haryana. Eligible participants were pregnant women attending antenatal clinic of secondary care center of rural Haryana from March to May 2015. Consecutive sampling was done to select pregnant women. Interview schedule was administered to the selected women, and midstream urine sample was collected. Urine sample was plated on MacConkey agar, and colony count was done using standard methods. A total of 1253 pregnant women were included in the study. The proportion of women with symptoms of UTI on the basis of history was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] - 30.7, 35.9), and UTI by colony count was 3.3% (95% CI - 2.4, 4.5). The presence of UTI was found to be significantly associated with the presence of any symptom of UTI on multivariate analysis (odds ratio [95% CI] - 7.35 [1.95, 27.77]). The burden of UTI among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic of a sub-district hospital was considerable, more so among the women that presented with symptoms suggestive of UTI. The study suggested that considering the burden of UTI and its complications, diagnosis of UTI at a resource-constrained setting like a secondary care hospital can be done after screening women for symptoms suggestive of UTI.

This community-based cross-sectional study combined with a qualitative component was conducted among 3438 couples chosen by multistage sampling. Quantitative data were collected by a structured interview schedule. Data were analyzed by computer using SPSS version 15.0. Chi-square test was applied for testing the significance of study findings and P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Qualitative data were collected by Focus Group Discussions and analyzed by qualitative free listing and pile sorting considering Smith's S value. Sex ratio at birth in West and South Tripura districts during 2013 was found to be 972 and 829 respectively. Son preference was higher among couples irrespective of their literacy, residence, occupation, family type and religion except Christianity. Expenditure at marriage, lesser contribution to parent's family and fears of adverse situations at in law's house after marriage etc. were causes for lesser daughter preference. Very few pregnant women underwent ultrasonography for sex determination of fetus. Girls had differential or delayed medical care and higher death rate. The desire for children was found to be limited after male births. Low daughter preference was mostly due to economic reasons and prolonged contraception following male birth.

India adopted the skills laboratories model for capacity building of health workers in maternal and child health in Bihar state. Current economic evaluation was performed with the objective of assessing the financial and economic cost of implementing skills laboratories. Data on all resources spent for the development of skill laboratory and implementing training during financial year 2011 were collected from Patna district in Bihar state. We used standard methods to estimate the full financial and economic costs of implementing the skills laboratories from a health system perspective. Overall cost of implementing 20 permanent and 10 mobile skills laboratory training in Bihar was Indian Rupee (INR) 8849895 from a financial perspective. The cost was nearly two times higher when using an economic perspective to account for opportunity cost of all resources used. The unit cost of training a participant using permanent and mobile laboratory was INR 6856 and INR 7474, respectively assuming an annual volume of 90 training. The optimum number of training which should be operated annually in a skills laboratory to make it most efficient is about 70-80 training per annum. Economic implications of skills laboratory organization should be borne while planning scale up in Bihar and other states. Further research on the effectiveness of two models of skill laboratory, that is, permanent and mobile and their cost is recommended.

Information on background, details of delivery, expenditure on delivery and on morbidities, and sources of funding was collected using a structured interview schedule. Only 29.6% of the households incurred OOPE, and the others incurred either nil OOPE or had a net income because of benefits received from Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK), Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), and \"Mamata\" schemes of the government. The median total OOPE was found to be 2100 INR (100-38,620). Multivariate analysis found parity, place of delivery, type of delivery, and presence of morbidity to be significantly associated with incurring any OOPE. Nearly 15% of the households incurred OOPE exceeding 40% of the reported monthly household income including 9%, whose OOPE was 100% or more of the reported household monthly income. While mechanisms such as JSSK, JSY, and Mamata had benefitted the vast majority, around half of those who did incur OOPE experienced CE.

The area across which risk exists of contracting the disease through transfer from the hosts or vectors, however, has never been mapped in detail, such that the area that surveillance, education, and investment in diagnostic facilities should cover remains unknown. This contribution uses known occurrences of the disease from the year 2000 till date to create and test a correlational ecological niche model that translates into preliminary transmission risk maps, which are summarized in terms of risk presented in each district in the region, as well as across peninsular India.","482":"Cancer cervix is the second common cause of cancer death in India. It is the most curable form of any human cancer if detected at the precancerous stage. Although several factors determine the survival of the disease, the clinical stage at presentation is the single most important predictor of long-term survival. The present study aimed to describe the performance and follow-up status and 5-year survival experience of the cervical cancer patients registered between 2010 and 2011 by the hospital registry of Malabar Cancer Centre, Kerala, and factors affecting lost to follow-up and survival among them. The case sheets of 227 patients retrospectively scrutinized during May-July 2014. The mean age of patients was 58.8 years (standard deviation = 11.67 years). The majority of the patients completed the initially planned treatment, but a low proportion of patients were likely to be on regular follow-up. This study revealed that most of the patients registered at the hospital only at an advanced stage. Using Kaplan-Meier method, the estimated 5 years survival rate was found to be 66.8%. It was noted that performance status before treatment and Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging were significantly associated with lost to follow-up and survival rate majority of the cervical cancer patients are observed to be highly noncomplaint to complete treatment and on follow-up. Thus, these findings stress the importance of counseling family members regarding the importance of follow-up and formulating public health policies aimed at increasing the awareness and implementation of cervical cancer screening programs in North Malabar.","483":"Anemia is major public health problem affecting 1.6 billion people worldwide. The poor compliance of iron supplementation remains main contributor for high prevalence of anemia. The current paper reviewed the effectiveness of direct observation of oral iron supplementation on anemia. A systematic search was performed through electronic databases and local libraries. Search strategies used subject headings and key words \"directly observed\" and \"iron supplementation.\" Searches were sought through April 2014. A total of 14 articles were included in the study. Findings were presented in three categories. First, all of those reported an improvement in compliance of iron supplementation. Second, reduction in the prevalence of anemia was reported by all and third, all except one reported increased blood hemoglobin level. Directly observed an iron supplementation is an effective approach for prevention and management of anemia in vulnerable groups. However, larger trials are needed before concluding that scaling up directly observed iron supplementation through community health volunteers would be beneficial.","484":"Truthfulness and honesty are absolute essentials of research. But to sustain in the not-so-pleasant \"publish-or-perish\" environment and \"cut-throat\" competition to increase the credibility associated with one's name, many individual researchers as well as research groups are turning towards research misconduct and this plague is gradually reaching epidemic and pandemic proportions.

The aim of the present cross-sectional study is to assess the awareness level of legal and social issues related to reproductive health and its association with the various individual and family\/household level characteristics. 650 adolescent girls in the age group of 15-19 years were interviewed with the help of pretested and semistructured questionnaire and focus group discussions were also conducted for qualitative findings in Chiraigaon block of district Varanasi. It was observed that 42.9% of the respondents were aware of legal age of marriage, 14.9% knew about the right age of childbearing. Dowry prohibition act and domestic violence act were known to 46% and 27% respondents, respectively, and only 2.6% were aware of medical termination of pregnancy act. Logistic regression analysis shows the significant effect of education on awareness of legal age of marriage, right age of childbearing, domestic violence, and dowry prohibition acts, which is also supported by qualitative findings. All the important legal issues\/acts should be included in high school curriculum and female teachers should be involved in training program for adolescents. Role of mass media in creating awareness about these issues in their routine programs should be ascertained. Accredited Social Health Activist and Anganwadi workers should be aware of and include these issues\/acts in adolescent meetings.

The project designed tools, processes and provided mentoring to frontline workers, community structures, and facilities to improve demand generation and quality of MNCH services. To assess over time changes in selected MNCH care indicators among women who had delivered in the past 2 months in Bagalkot and Koppal districts. An innovative strategy was designed to collect routine monitoring data, namely community behavior tracking survey using mobile technology. The catchment area of an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) was the primary sampling unit, and in each district 200, ASHA areas were selected. Women from these selected ASHA areas were interviewed and information collected on various MNCH care outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess changes in selected MNCH care indicators. Gradual increase was noticed in institutional delivery, hospital stay for 48 or more hours, initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour and continuum of MNCH care. Forty-eight hours stay and initiation of breastfeeding improved marginally possibly due to health systems and cultural norms. Results indicated that the interventions were successful in changing the critical MNCH care indicators and hence have potential for replication in similar high priority district settings.

To describe cases and deaths of 2013 pH1N1 positives, to evaluate the high case fatality ratio and risk factors for pH1N1-associated mortality among the hospitalized cases in Punjab for 2013. A case-control study was conducted and compared those who died from confirmed pH1N1 with those who survived in the hospital between January 1, 2013, and April 30, 2013. Sociodemographic and clinical details were extracted from hospital records and from telephone interviews with controls and next of kin of cases using pretested questionnaires. Logistic regression analysis was performed. A total of 182 laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases (99 males and 83 females) were hospitalized in 30 hospitals in Punjab; 42 (23%) patients died. Those who died were significantly more likely to be younger than 50 years of age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =10.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.8-21.1), be obese (AOR = 16.7, 95% CI = 1.6-170.7), and have visited more than two health-care facilities before laboratory confirmation (AOR = 25.8, 95% CI = 5.4-121.6). The health-care community should have a high index of suspicion for influenza, and general community should be sensitized about risk factors and to seek medical advice early in the illness. ","489":"New permanent contraceptive methods are in development, including nonsurgical permanent contraception (NSPC). In the present study, perceptions of NSPC in India among married women, married men, mothers-in-law, providers, and health advocates in Eastern Maharashtra (Wardha district) and New Delhi were examined. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 married women and 20 mothers-in-law; surveys with 150 married men; and focus group discussions with obstetrics\/gynecology providers and advocates. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using a grounded theory approach, where emerging themes are analyzed during the data collection period. The majority of female respondents expressed support of permanent contraception and interest in NSPC, stating the importance of avoiding surgery and minimizing recovery time. They expressed concerns about safety and efficacy; many felt that a confirmation test would be necessary regardless of the failure rate. Most male respondents were supportive of female permanent contraception (PC) and preferred NSPC to a surgical method, as long as it was safe and effective. Providers were interested in NSPC yet had specific concerns about safety, efficacy, cost, uptake, and government pressure. They also had concerns that a nonsurgical approach could undermine the inherent seriousness of choosing PC. Advocates were interested in NSPC but had concerns about safety and potential misuse in the Indian context. Although perceptions of NSPC were varied, all study populations indicated interest in NSPC. Concerns about safety, efficacy, appropriate patient counseling, and ethics emerged from the present study and should be considered as NSPC methods continue to be developed.

NBCC provides an acceptable environment for all infants at birth, and it is mandatory for all delivery points at all levels in the health system including operation theaters. The objective of this study was to find the status of availability of NBCCs and service provision in selected public health facilities of Bihar. A total of 57 NBCCs, having high delivery load (&gt;100 deliveries\/month), across 25 high-priority districts in Bihar, were selected purposively in consultation with the State Health Society, Bihar, for the assessment. These facilities were assessed for the availability and\/or functioning of infrastructure, equipment maintenance, human resource, supply of drugs and consumables, adherence to protocols, and record keeping. Only 22.8% of the NBCCs were found to be fully functional, majority (68.4%) were partially functional, and 9% were nonfunctional. Thirty-seven (64.9%) NBCCs were located inside the labor room premises. Approximately, one-third of the neonates delivered were kept in NBCCs. Equipment though available lacked the provision of annual maintenance contract. Essential drugs such as adrenaline (24.6%) and Vitamin K injection (42.1%) were not available in many facilities. Only 6.2% of the newborns had low birth weight, indicating underreporting. Majority of the health-care staff available were trained but possessed poor skills. Data recording and reporting was also suboptimal. The network of NBCCs needs to be strengthened across the state and linked with higher facilities to achieve the desired reduction in neonatal morbidity and mortality. ","492":"UNICEF launched the mobile-based Effective Vaccine Management (EVM) system in Bihar in 2014 along with the state government to electronically capture information and identify gaps in the existing vaccine management system for appropriate action. This study accessed the implementation process of this initiative. Quantitative data related to vaccine supply chain management indicators were collected in November-December 2015 using factsheets and dashboards, representing the situation of the vaccine supply and cold chain management system at regular intervals since the launch. In-depth interviews were conducted with the program specialists to understand the initiative's genesis, its challenges and strengths. This initiative resulted in an increased cold chain space from 49% (July 2014) to 87% (September 2015), deployment of sufficient human resource; 38 cold chain technicians for regular maintenance of the machines and equipment, installation of necessary equipment, and upgradation of state and regional vaccine stores. In health facilities, district vaccine stores, and regional vaccine stores, marked improvements were observed in the overall EVM criteria indicators (82%, 84%, and 80% in September 2015, respectively, as against 51%, 46%, and 43% in July 2014, respectively) as well as EVM category indicators (83%, 84%, and 76% in September 2015, respectively, as compared to 54%, 53%, and 54% in July 2014, respectively). The EVM mobile initiative was successfully implemented and it complies with its objective of providing experienced guidance to the human resource responsible for vaccine cold chain management.

","493":"UNICEF along with the State Government of Bihar launched a computer tablet-based Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS) in 2014, to capture real-time data online and to minimize the challenges faced with the conventional MCTS. The article reports the process of implementation of tablet-based MCTS in Bihar. In-depth interviews with medical officers, program managers, data managers, auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), and a monitoring and evaluation specialist were conducted in October 2015 to understand the process of implementation, challenges and possibility for sustainability, and scale-up of the innovation. MCTS innovation was introduced initially in one Primary Health Centre each in Gaya and Purnia districts. The device, supported with Android MCTS software and connected to a dummy server, was given to ANMs. ANMs were trained in its application. The innovation allows real-time data entry, instant uploading, and generation of day-to-day work plans for easy tracking of beneficiaries for providing in-time health-care services. The nonlinking of the dummy server to the national MCTS portal has not lessened the burden of data entry operators, who continue to enter data into the national portal as before. The innovation has been successfully implemented to meet its objective of tracking the beneficiaries. The national database should be linked to the dummy server or visible impact. The model is sustainable if the challenges can be met. Mobile technology offers a tremendous opportunity to strengthen the capacity of frontline workers and clinicians and increase the quality, completeness, and timeliness of delivery of critical health services. ","494":"Quality of care at the facilities during childbirth remains a major concern. Improved quality could have the greatest dividend in saving maternal and newborn lives. The objective of this study was to implement quality assurance measures in the labor rooms of select public health facilities in two districts of Bihar. The labor room quality assurance intervention was implemented in two districts, Gaya and Purnea in Bihar. Health facilities having &gt;200 deliveries\/month were assessed using labor room quality assurance checklist developed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The critical gaps affecting service delivery were identified, and a list of priority actions for quality improvement was developed. An intervention model was rolled out in consultation with the district authorities focusing on the building blocks of the health system. The interventions were implemented from August 2014 to March 2016 in selected facilities after which an assessment was conducted. Initial assessment of labor room was conducted in 24 facilities. After 2 years of intervention, there was a definite improvement in quality assurance scores in most facilities. The infection control scores increased by 20 points in Gaya (from 40 to 59.9) and 10 points in Purnea (from 57.6 to 67.1). The highest gain in scores was observed in quality management component in Gaya (from 6.2 to 58.2). The model attempted to incorporate all the elements of the health system to ensure scalability and sustainability.

","495":"Nonpneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG) is a first-aid device that can save lives of women experiencing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The aim was to explore the feasibility of implementation of NASG intervention at select public health primary care facilities in two high priority districts of Bihar. Qualitative design was used to document the NASG implementation process. In-depth interviews were conducted with health-care providers in November-December 2015. These healthcare providers were chosen purposively based on their involvement in the use of NASG. The implementation process of NASG, process of training for its use, challenges faced during the rollout of implementation and the recommendations for improving the implementation were explored. Initially, a baseline study was conducted to assess the knowledge and skills of health-care providers regarding diagnosis and management of PPH. Implementation consisted of orientation and training of service providers on the identification of PPH cases and usage of the NASG garment during referrals. The interviews with stakeholders reflected that even after training and appropriate introduction of the practice of using the NASG bag, the initiative did not make a difference in ameliorating the situation of PPH management in the health facilities over 6 months. This study provides lessons for implementation and scaling up of NASG in public health systems, not only in Bihar but also other similar settings. It also calls for robust implementation research studies to generate evidence on the use of NASG at the primary health-care facilities as an intervention in program settings. ","496":"Several programmatic and logistic issues affect the overall performance of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). Bihar Government provided bicycles to ASHAs in West Champaran district for increasing coverage of services by improving their mobility. To assess the use of bicycles by ASHAs and it's effect on service delivery. It also captures the perspectives of ASHAs in terms of its utilization for performing tasks. A community-based quasi-experimental study was undertaken during March-May 2016. Proportion of newborn babies visited within 24 h of birth was the primary outcome. Data were collected from two intervention blocks (West Champaran district) and a control block from the neighboring East Champaran district. A total of 323 (177 from intervention blocks and 146 from control block) mothers having children &lt;3 years of age and who had delivered at home were interviewed. Besides, 88 ASHAs working in intervention blocks were also interviewed. Significantly higher proportion of mothers and newborn babies (44%) received postnatal care within 24 h of delivery in intervention blocks as compared to the control block (16%, P &lt; 0.001). Nearly 73.1% of ASHAs were using the bicycle themselves. ASHAs were twice more likely to visit a newborn on the day of delivery if she was provided with mobility support. However, the likelihood of continuing visits after the 1st day was not statistically significant. The intervention demonstrated the potential of ASHAs to improve their functioning at the grass-root level. The scale-up of bicycle intervention should be supplemented with reforms in financial incentives disbursement and better system support. ","497":"Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of under-five child deaths worldwide and in India. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a powerful and easy-to-use method to promote health and well-being and reduce morbidity and mortality in preterm\/low birth weight (LBW) babies. As the part of the roll-out of India Newborn Action Plan interventions, we implemented KMC in select facilities with an objective to assess the responsiveness of public health system to roll out KMC. KMC intervention was implemented in two select high priority districts, Gaya and Purnea in Bihar over the duration of 8 months from August 2015 to March 2016. The implementation of intervention was phased out into; situation analysis, implementation of intervention, and interim assessment. KMC model, as envisaged keeping in mind the building blocks of health system, was established in 6 identified health-care facilities. A pretested simple checklist was used to assess the awareness, knowledge, skills, and practice of KMC during baseline situational analysis and interim assessment phases for comparison. The intervention clearly seemed to improve the awareness among auxiliary nurse midwives\/nurses about KMC. Improvements were also observed in the availability of infrastructure required for KMC and support logistics like facility for manual expression of breast milk, cups\/suitable devices such as paladi cups for feeding small babies and digital weighing scale. Although the recording of information regarding LBW babies and KMC practice improved, still there is scope for much improvement. There is a commitment at the national level to promote KMC in every facility. The present experience shows the possibility of rolling out KMC in secondary level facilities with support from government functionaries. ","498":"Hypertension is a public health problem with low detection and treatment rates in India. We resurveyed 1284 patients with hypertension already identified in baseline survey of the cohort in Thiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu, India. The objective was to estimate the proportion of patients with drug treatment, hypertension control and lifestyle modification at follow-up (median follow-up 27 months). Overall, only 19.9% of the patients took drugs and 45.3% had blood pressure under control. Among 256 patients on drugs, 179 (69.9%) were on a single drug, 71 (27.7%) on two drugs, and six (2.3%) on three drugs. Commonly prescribed drugs based on the prescription review were beta blockers (50.4%), calcium channel blockers (36.7%), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (18.4%), and diuretics (11.7%). Salt reduction was reported by 49.7% of the patients. There is a need for strengthening the health systems for effective management of hypertension and patient education to ensure active involvement in the long-term care.","499":"Country- and state-wise maternal mortality shows the highest disparity among health statistics. The erstwhile National Rural Health Mission. (NRHM) in India aimed reduction in maternal mortality ratio. (MMR) to &lt;100 per lakh live births. Accordingly, many new initiatives were planned and started. This analysis was carried out using data from the Sample Registration System. The data from 1997 to 1998 are available which dates 8 years prior to the launching of NRHM. Hence, comparison period was considered as 8 years of implementation of NRHM. The overall decline in MMR prior to NRHM was 36% and after NRHM implementation 30%. The difference is not significant. The best states and lowest states had changed, but the disparity also has remained almost at the ratio of 1:5. The pace of decline has not increased after NRHM. As well disparity ratio has not reduced indicating the differentially better treatment to the vulnerable states was not adequate.","500":"Rapid pace of unplanned urbanization in the developing countries has resulted in a large proportion of children becoming homeless, leading to multiple children living on the streets. These children are highly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Against this background, studies on the situational analysis of street children across India are needed; therefore, a study to assess the condition of street children in the city of Varanasi was planned. Street children registered with a nongovernmental organization were contacted. Four hundred and fifteen children were selected by random sampling, and this group was administered a semi-structured interview containing 35 items. It was found that all forms of abuse were common, but physical abuse (74%) was highest and the police (25.5%) was an important perpetrator. Younger children were much more vulnerable. The sample commonly had boys and between the ages of 10 and 15 years. It was concluded that these children need policies to be incorporated into the mainstream.","501":"Premarital Health Counseling (PMHC) is emerging as a growing trend worldwide. The couples are provided with accurate and unbiased information and assistance, who are planning to get marry with the aim of screening, educating, and counseling about nutritional disorders, communicable diseases, medical conditions, hereditary\/genetic disorders, and guiding for a healthy pregnancy. Premarital screening and adequate counseling are essential for changing attitudes toward consanguineous marriage particularly in places where consanguineous and \"tribal\" marriages are common, resulting in a high incidence of genetic disorders. Although making PMHC obligatory in India may appear to be a very exciting and promising proposal, its implementation still has various ethical issues and other barriers that need to be addressed.","502":"Human studies on the effects of probiotics on lowering blood cholesterol levels have not yielded conclusive results.

There is a lack of organized surveillance system to measure the incidence of animal bite and human rabies as well as to evaluate cost-saving of different routes, regimen, and types of antirabies vaccines (ARV)\/immunoglobulin available in India. The objective of this study is to know dropout rate in intradermal (i.d.) ARV regimen among animal bite and to analyze the utilized volume of ARV by a different route of vaccine administration. A total of 250 animal bite victims were followed up at ARV Clinic (ARVC). Volume utilization of i.d. route over intramuscular (i.m.) route was analyzed among the patients who attended ARVC during the past 2 years. Total dropout and delayed compliance rates of ARV regimen among different group were compared by Chi-square test. The i.d. route was about five times more volume and cost-saving than i.m. route. The majority of victims belonged to 15-30 years (27.60%) and children &lt;15 years (26.40%) and had wound at their lower limbs (85%) mainly bitten by dogs (98%). Thirty-four percent total dropout and 31.5% delayed compliance observed particularly during the last dose of i.d. regimen. There was no significant difference in dropout rates among different demographic groups. Half of the victims practiced wound toilet on the same day of bite. Only 68% received the first dose of ARV within 24 h of the exposure. Children and young adults are at higher risk of having dog bite. I.d. ARV regimen is more volume and cost-saving than i.m. one and proper counseling and follow-up should be arranged to complete the vaccination schedule.

To understand sexual practices and contraceptive use of people living with HIV (PLHIV) before and after being diagnosed with the infection and assess the providers' perspectives on provision of contraceptives to PLHIV, the quality of services provided and linkages between reproductive health and HIV services. A mix method design study using a purposive sampling was undertaken enrolling PLHIV from ART centers and PLHIV networks across three cities in India. Doctors and counselors providing HIV services at public hospitals were also interviewed. Use of condoms increased from 35% to 81% after being diagnosed with HIV. Consistent condom use was 69% compared to only 8.7% before being diagnosed with HIV. Nearly 41% (297) of participants indulged in one or more forms of risky sexual behaviors. Significant correlates of risky sexual practices were: participants who were middle-aged (25-33 years), formerly married, currently not on antiretroviral therapy, and received negligible information on contraception from service providers leading to poor knowledge on safe sex and dual protection. Information from service providers reveals a lack of specific program guidelines to comprehensively address family planning (FP) issues through HIV programs. The study throws light on missed opportunities to address contraceptive needs of PLHIV and recommends training service providers and operationalizing a strategy to link HIV and FP services.

Such inequalities are unnecessary and unjust and may exist between and within nations, societies, and population groups. Social determinants such as wealth, income, occupation, education, gender, and racial\/ethnic groups are the principal drivers of this inequality since they determine the health risks and preventive behaviors, access to, and affordability of health care. Within this framework, there is a debate on assigning a personal responsibility factor over and above societal responsibility to issues of ill health. One school of philosophy argues that when individuals are worse-off than others for no fault of their own, it is unjust, as opposed to health disparities that arise due to avoidable personal choices such as smoking and drug addiction for which there should (can) be a personal responsibility. Opposing thoughts have pointed out that the relative socioeconomic position of an individual dictates how his\/her life may progress from education to working conditions and aging, susceptibility to diseases and infirmity, and the consequences thereof. The existence of a social gradient in health outcomes across populations throughout the world is a testimony to this truth. It has been emphasized that assuming personal responsibility for health in public policy-making can only have a peripheral place. Instead, the concept of individual responsibility should be promoted as a positive concept of enabling people to gain control over the determinants of health through conscious, informed, and healthy choices.

A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted among medical and paramedical personnel working at primary health-care institutions in two districts of West Bengal. Knowledge was assessed using a structured questionnaire while diagnostic skill and logistic support were assessed with structured checklists. Clinical skill was assessed with case vignettes. Requisite knowledge on diagnostic procedure was found in two-third to three-fourth of health personnel while only 26.7% and 12.4%, respectively, knew the correct treatment of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Median standardized score for knowledge was 50.0 while the scores for skill of preparing blood slide and for rapid diagnostic test were 70.0 and 57.1, respectively. Education and work experience were related to diagnostic skill but had little effect on knowledge. In clinical skill, medical personnel scored 50% or more in investigation and treatment aspects only. In another case vignette, health workers excelled over medical officers and other staff in all axes other than history taking and clinical examination although their performance was also suboptimal. Formal training on malaria did not show any bearing on median knowledge and skill score. Supply of diagnostics and drugs was insufficient in majority of SCs.

Vaccines can be viewed from a public health perspective as well as scientific perspective. Public health experts would focus epidemiological relevance, immunological competency, and technological feasibility. Scientists however will look for a good immune response as well as long-lived immunity, stability considerations, and safety issues such as danger of reversion to virulence. In India, the vaccine coverage is far from satisfactory, national average for full immunization being only 65%. Presently, nine vaccines are being used in the Universal Immunization Program. However, some more have started in pilot, and some are still in the pipeline. Although administrative, logistic and operational challenges have to be faced when introducing a new vaccine into the public health system; these are solvable and should not be a hindrance to the introduction. A real-life example of nonintroduction of a lifesaving vaccine is - the oral cholera vaccine. This vaccine which is manufactured and licensed in India has been the World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified, and it is being used worldwide. Although the disease is a major threat, the disease has its stigma and has led to its low reporting even from cholera endemic areas of the country. Thus, in spite of the WHO recommendations, the vaccine is not being introduced into the national program which would take it to people who need it the most only because of apparent lack of sufficient disease burden data and political commitment.

This cross-sectional study was conducted in the rural and urban areas of the district of Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, India among children of 1-10 years of age. In the first phase, the children in the age group of 1-10 years were screened for mental retardation using the Ten Questions Screen, whereas in the second phase the suspects were evaluated clinically. The prevalence of mental retardation was found to be 1.71% in the study population with higher prevalence (3.3%) in the 73-120 months age group. The prevalence was higher among the males in all study populations [rural: 1.9%, urban (nonslum): 1.6%, and urban slum: 7.14%). The prevalence was similar among the urban (nonslum) (1.75%) and rural (1.11%) populations, whereas it was higher (4%) in the urban slum population. A prevalence of 2% was seen in families from the lower middle class and 1.8% among families from the lower class in the rural population, whereas a prevalence of 2% was seen among lower middle class families of urban (nonslum) areas.

Males were the HIV-infected partners in 72% of the serodiscordant partnerships analyzed. Seroconcordance was significantly associated with the occupation status of being a housewife (P = 0.009). The contribution of discordant partnerships to the burden of HIV\/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is significant, warranting novel couple-targeted counselling strategies and preventive measures, including safe sexual behavior and possibly preexposure HIV prophylaxis of the uninfected partner.

Two decades of research has provided detailed information on multiple aspects of exposure assessment and risk characterization. However, policy paralysis due to lack of finances and lack of any administrative coordination between the Central and State Governments has hampered the implementation of long-term solutions. Household- and community-level arsenic removal units have provided some relief to the suffering population. In view of the increased funding through the 12th Five-Year Plan period, it is the responsibility of the authorities to implement piped water supply schemes with single-point treatment facilities as the permanent solution to this three-decade-long crisis. Incorporating research evidence into policy and focusing on behavior change communication would be crucial to that end. ","566":"The strategy for prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in India is based on syndromic case management delivered through designated STI\/reproductive tract infection (RTI) centers (DSRCs) situated in medical colleges, district hospitals, and STI-clinics of targeted interventions programs. Laboratory tests for enhanced syndromic management are available at some sites. To ensure country-level planning and effective local implementation of STI services, reliable and consistent epidemiologic information is required on the distribution of STI cases, rate and trends of newly acquired infections, and STI prevalence in specific population groups. The present STI management information system is inadequate to meet these requirements because it is based on syndromic data and limited laboratory investigations on STIs reported passively by DSRCs and laboratories. Geographically representative information on the etiology of STI syndromes and antimicrobial susceptibility of STI pathogens although essential for optimizing available treatment options, is deficient. Surveillance must provide high quality information on: (a) prevalence of STIs such as syphilis, trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia among high-risk groups; syphilis in the general population and pregnant antenatal women; (b) demographic characteristics such as age, sex, new\/recurrent episode, and type of syndromically diagnosed STI cases; (c) proportion of acute infections such as urethral discharge (UD) in men and nonherpetic genital ulcer disease (GUD) in men and women; (d) etiology of STI syndromes; and (e) gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility.

GOHAI was translated into the Hindi language and self-administered to 420 subjects aged 55 years or above. The measures for reliability, and concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity were assessed. The questionnaire sought information about sociodemographic details, habits related to tobacco, dental visits, tooth brushing, and self-reported perceptions of general and oral health. Cronbach's alpha (0.774) showed high internal consistency and homogeneity between items. Low GOHAI scores were associated with the perceptions of poor oral and general health, low satisfaction with oral health, and a perceived need for dental care. Respondents with high socioeconomic status were likely to have high GOHAI scores. The Hindi version of the GOHAI demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability, and will be an important instrument to measure oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) for people in this region.

However, there is a lack of adequate information about guideline development process, review, and update. This paper reports on the systematic appraisal of Indian guidelines related to maternity management (MM) and family planning (FP) using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument, which was one of the components of a pilot research in 2012-13. Forty-four selected guidelines about MM and FP, identified through a consensus building workshop, were independently appraised by two appraisers with AGREE instrument having six different domains. Mean item scores, domain scores, and standardized scores were calculated by averaging the scores across the two appraisers. Most guidelines scored high in scope and purpose and clarity of presentation. However, they had little documentation about the development group member details, incorporation of patient views, evidence search method, method chosen for formulating recommendations, tools for application, potential barriers, cost implications, and information about the funding body. Nonclinical guidelines scored higher than clinical guidelines (P = 0.01) for MM in the domain applicability. Clinical FP guidelines scored higher than nonclinical guidelines in the domain of rigor of development (0.01). Despite being clinically sound, Indian guidelines score poorly due to weak documentation about their development process. It is recommended that the guideline development process be improved with systematic documentation for achieving standardization.

All licensed long-distance commercial vehicle drivers who travel a distance of at least 500 km from the city metropolis were recruited. Each fourth consecutive driver who was to load his vehicle for the day was interviewed at the 10 long-distance motor parks. They responded to a sociodemographic and semi-structured pro forma requesting the type of drug used and the reason and pattern of use. The data obtained were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 16. All the respondents were males with a mean age of 43.4 years. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean age of substance users and nonusers (t = 0.491, P = 0.853). The reasons given for drug use were to keep awake while driving, for pleasure, as part of the culture, peer influence, as a substitute for food and for no obvious reason. The pattern of use tended to be related to the reason given for the use. The reason for drug use in long-distance drivers could be used to modify the pattern of use to minimize the risk associated with drugged driving.

The objective of this exploratory study was to document the perceptions and perspectives of practicing pediatricians with regard to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in selected metropolitan areas of India. A qualitative study was conducted to generate evidence on the perspective of pediatricians practicing in the private sector regarding pneumococcal vaccination. The pediatricians were identified from 11 metropolitan areas on the basis of PCV vaccine sales in India through multilevel stratified sampling method. Relevant information was collected through in-depth personal interviews. Finally, qualitative data analysis was carried out through standard techniques such as the identification of key domains, words, phrases, and concepts from the respondents. We observed that the majority (67.7%) of the pediatricians recommended pneumococcal vaccination to their clients, whereas 32.2% recommended it to only those who could afford it. More than half (62.9%) of the pediatricians had no preference for any brand and recommended both a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) and a 13-valent PCV (PCV13), whereas 8.0% recommended none. An overwhelming majority (97.3%) of the pediatricians reported that the main reason for a patient not following the pediatrician's advice for pneumococcal vaccination was the price of PCV. To reduce childhood pneumonia-related burden and mortality, pediatricians should use every opportunity to increase awareness about vaccine-preventable diseases, especially vaccine-preventable childhood pneumonia among their patients.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out using the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), 2011 data to explore the association between communication and the current use of contraception. After adjusting the related socioeconomic and demographic factors, the mass media did not seem to have any role in predicting contraceptive use behavior while the findings revealed that interpersonal communication [prevalence ratio (PR): 1.0984, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0801-1.1170] is a strong positive predictor of the current contraceptive use. It is a well-known fact that mass media performs only the knowledge function while interpersonal communication performs an additional function of persuasion. This analysis corroborates the statement that the role of interpersonal communication is quite important in predicting contraceptive use.

This article using NFHS-3 data is an attempt to bring out the impact of economic status, i.e., the wealth index on maternal health. The study was based on an analysis of the NFHS-3 data. Independent variables taken were the wealth index, literacy, and age at first child birth. Effects of these variables on the maternal health care services were investigated. Out of the total 124,385 women aged 15-49 years included in the NFHS-3 dataset, 36,850 (29.6%) had one or more childbirth during the past 5 years. The number of antenatal care (ANC) visits increased as the wealth index increased and there was a pattern for choice of place of delivery (for all deliveries during the last 5 years) according to the wealth index. Logistic regression analysis of the abovementioned variables were sought to find out the independent role of key determinants of the different aspects of maternal health care. It showed that the wealth index is the leading key independent determinant for three or more ANC received: Tetanus toxoid (TT) received before delivery, iron tablet\/syrup taken for more than 100 days, and institutional delivery. Mother's literacy was the leading independent key determinant for early antenatal registration. The study suggested that along with the mother's literacy, the wealth index that is an important predictor of maternal health care can be added for categorization of the districts for providing differential approach for maternal health care services.

Though the overall dentist population ratio in India is 1:10,000, at present in rural India, one dentist is serving 2.5 lakhs of people. Only 15-20% of people in India are able to get dental services through national schemes, and 80-85% are spending money from their pockets, providing an ideal breeding ground for quackery into dental practice in India. Dental quacks cater to the lower-middle and lower socioeconomic classes that cannot afford qualified dental practitioners. A large number of people visiting these quacks seek care only when in pain, have a restricted budget, and are not very quality conscious. Dentistry has come a long way in the last one and a half century; today it is ranked as one of the most respected professions. It is incumbent upon dentists everywhere to protect this hard-earned reputation by weeding out quacks from among them. The government should urge fresh graduates to practice in rural areas and provide more incentives to them. Public health dentists should take the initiative of adopting more community-oriented oral health programs to increase the awareness among rural populations.

Validation of the device was conducted in the laboratory of the South Asia regional office of the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD). The validity of the device was assessed using device specific indicators, comparison of iCheck Iodine device with the iodometric titration, and comparison between iodine estimation using 1 g and 10 g salt by iCheck Iodine using 116 salt samples procured from various small-, medium-, and large-scale salt processors across India. The intra- and interassay imprecision for 10 parts per million (ppm), 30 ppm, and 50 ppm concentrations of iodized salt were 2.8%, 6.1%, and 3.1%, and 2.4%, 2.2%, and 2.1%, respectively. Interoperator imprecision was 6.2%, 6.3%, and 4.6% for the salt with iodine concentrations of 10 ppm, 30 ppm, and 50 ppm respectively. The correlation coefficient between measurements by the two methods was 0.934 and the correlation coefficient between measurements using 1 g of iodized salt and 10 g of iodized salt by the iCheck Iodine device was 0.983.

To measure the spiritual health status of the study population, describe the coping skills used by them in crisis situations, identify the sociodemographic factors associated with their spiritual health, and to determine the association of spiritual health status of the study population and their coping skills. An institution-based cross-sectional study was performed among the third semester medical students in government medical colleges of Kolkata, West Bengal, India. The study was conducted among 362 medical students by the survey questionnaire method. The Spiritual Health Scale 2011 (SHS 2011) and the Brief COPE Scale were used to measure the spiritual health and coping status, respectively. Of all the respondents, 75.7% had refined spiritual health. The mean spiritual health score of the female students was significantly higher than that of the males. Of all the students, 66.1% showed good coping scores. Of all the respondents, 86.2% and 24.5% had higher adaptive and maladaptive coping scores, respectively. Refined spiritual categories were seen more among those students whose fathers had higher education and whose families arranged rituals at their homes. The spiritual health, self-evolution, and self-actualization scores of the respondents were significantly related to the adaptive coping scores and the fathers' education. The coping skills and hence, the spiritual health of the medical students were greatly influenced by the education of the father and cultural factor(s) like arranging annual rituals at home. ","584":"To address the acute shortages of health workers in underserved, remote, and difficult-to-access areas, the Government of Chhattisgarh and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) launched the Chhattisgarh Rural Medical Corps (CRMC) in 2009. CRMC has enabled provisions such as financial incentives, residential accommodation, life insurance, and extra marks during admission at the postgraduate (PG) level to eligible doctors for the attraction and retention of health workers, i.e., doctors, staff nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), and rural medical assistants (RMAs) in underserved areas. This study aims to understand the CRMC scheme in terms of implementation, challenges, gaps, and outcome in achieving the attraction and retention of health workers in the remote and difficult-to-access areas of Chhattisgarh. The study adopts a mix of both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The purposive sampling method was used for the selection of three districts having normal, difficult, and inaccessible areas. Data were collected through key informant (KI) interviews with beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of CRMC or district and state government officials, and reviews of document were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. CRMC has made positive outcome as 1319 health workers, including doctors, have joined the service in 2010-11, reducing the vacancy of doctors from 90% to 45%. The scope of CRMC was primarily limited to payment of monthly financial incentives. The fund utilization rate of CRMC has increased (from 27% in 2009-10 to 98% in 2011-12), though there are delays in payment of incentives. The majority of staff lack awareness about CRMC during job applications. The payment of incentives based on facility performance has demotivated staff. Establishment of a performance management system, activating the CRMC cell to make it functional, and wide publicity of CRMC benefits are likely to improve attraction and retention of staff.

It is essential for the bite victims to complete the full course of vaccination as recommended for complete protection. The present study was conducted to determine the compliance rate for anti-rabies vaccination by both intramuscular route and intradermal route and to determine the major constraints. The study was done at two municipal corporation hospitals in Bangalore, India. The compliance rate for intramuscular rabies vaccination was 60.0% and for intradermal rabies vaccination 77.0%. The major constraints were loss of wages, forgotten dates, cost incurred and distance from the hospital. Hence, the present study showed that the compliance to anti-rabies vaccination for post-exposure prophylaxis is low and is a cause of concern, as animal bite victims who do not complete the full course of vaccination are still at risk of developing rabies.

Most encephalitis cases occur in rural areas due to poor environmental sanitation, high-vector density, shortage of protected water supplies and lack of health education. Vaccination, environmental sanitation, vector control, health education and attention to prompt diagnosis and treatment in rural hospitals are the four essential pillars for reducing case fatality rate (CFR) of encephalitis. Frequently, virulence of the virus, immunological state of the host, unavailability of antiviral drugs and lack of enough tertiary care hospitals (TCH) are not responsible for the high CFR. Basic supportive care is not being practiced meticulously in Primary and Secondary Care Hospitals (PSCH), and their services are not being utilized fully. Main causes of high mortality and morbidity rates are hypoxia and ischemia of brain and other organs precipitated by preventable, controllable or treatable complications due to lack of basic medical and nursing care during transport to the TCH. Undiagnosed Rickettsial infections are suspected to be partly responsible for the high CFR in some areas. Improving rural hospitals and their ambulance services are the most economical way to reduce CFR. \"Treatment facilities must be made available at places where cases occur.\" The best way to reduce CFR of encephalitis in developing and underdeveloped countries is to increase and improve PSCH and sensitize politicians, administrators, medical\/nursing professionals and more importantly to impress and convince the public to utilize them.

Geographical and physical differences necessitate using national growth curves. This study aims to construct growth curves using anthropometric measurements namely weight and height for Indian children using cross-sectional data from National Family and Health Surveys. Box-Cox power exponential, a flexible distribution, was used that offers to adjust kurtosis and improves the estimation of extreme percentiles. LMS-methods that fit skewed data adequately and generate fitted curves that follow closely the empirical data, with maximum penalized likelihood, Akaike information criteria (AIC) and generalized AIC with penalty 3 were used to construct the growth curves. Before fittings this model factors which influence the nutritional status of children were examined, similar to World Health Organization (WHO) (2006) factors, namely standard infant feeding practices, sanitation, non-smoking mothers additionally poverty (household consumable assets based). Model fitted in LMS-model and standard based on height and weight for children aged 0-60 months was obtained after iteration for degrees of freedom for the parameters. Growth curves for mean Z-scores and percentiles were constructed for both sexes and significant lower values were noticeably found to set as growth-standard compared to WHO-standards. Study showed the prospect of constructing regional\/national growth curve and their need for the assessment of children's growth, which could help to identify undernourished-children at national level. There is an urgent need to collect longitudinal data of children to fit the growth curve of children in India. ","668":"It is hypothesized that exposure to transportation noise is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease among adult population. The present study further explores this association in the light of new findings. The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of studies reported during the last 3 decades on the association of transportation noise exposure with cardiovascular disease endpoints among adult population in cross-sectional studies. Relative risks were pooled from 12 studies by using an inverse-variance weighted fixed-effects model. The cardiovascular health outcomes included ischemic heart disease, myocardial infraction, angina pectoris, electrocardiogram-ischemia and cardiovascular medication. The pooled risk estimate (95% confidence interval) of 1.04 (0.96-1.12), shows a positive but nonsignificant association. The sensitivity analysis, conducted by excluding studies one by one, resulted in a positive and significant risk estimate. Contrary to the earlier meta-analysis, this study observed heterogeneity among subgroups and produced significant positive results to show that there exists an association between air traffic noise exposure and cardiovascular disease. It was also observed that the risk of cardiovascular disease due to exposure to transportation noise has increase to significant levels over the last 30 years. It can be concluded that though the association between transportation noise exposure and cardiovascular disease is evident, but not at a significant level. This study although provides evidence that air traffic noise is a serious cause of concern.

At present, the Public Health Education in India is offered through medical colleges and also outside the corridors of medical colleges which was not the scenario earlier. Traditionally, Public Health Education has been a domain of medical colleges and was open for medical graduates only. In order to standardize the Postgraduate Medical Education in India, the National Board of Examinations (NBE) was set up as an independent autonomous body of its kind in the country in the field of medical sciences with the prime objective of improving the quality of the medical education. NBE has also played a significant role in enhancing Public Health Education in India through its Diplomat of National Board (DNB) Programs in Social and Preventive Medicine, Health and Hospital Administration, Maternal and Child Health, Family Medicine and Field Epidemiology. It envisions creating a cadre of skilled and motivated public health professionals and also developing a roadmap for postgraduate career pathways. However, there still exists gamut of opportunities for it to engage in expanding the scope of Public Health Education. It can play a key role in accreditation of public health programs and institutions which can transform the present landscape of education of health professionals. It also needs to revisit and re-initiate programs like DNB in Tropical Medicine and Occupational Health which were discontinued.

This study was examined the factors associated with utilization of maternal and child health services in Kapilvastu District of Nepal. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2010 by interviewing 190 mothers having children of aged 12-23 months using the standardized questionnaire. Immunization status (97.4%) and vitamin A supplementation (98.4%) was high. However, initiation of breastfeeding within an hour of birth was low (45.3%) and 63.2% had practiced exclusive breastfeeding. Majority (69.5%) of respondents delivered their child at home and 39.5% sought assistance from health workers. The mothers who did not have any education, mothers from Dalit\/Janjati and the Terai origin were less likely to deliver at the health facility and to seek the assistance of health workers during childbirth. The immunization program coverage was high, whereas maternal health service utilization remained poor. Interventions that focus on mothers from Dalit\/Janjati group and with lower education are likely to increase utilization of maternal health services.

Hence, need exists for a simple and easily applicable intervention, which may counter these challenges. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of very early skin-to-skin contact (SSC), in term babies with their mothers, on success of breastfeeding and neonatal well-being. Randomized control trial conducted over 2 years' period in a tertiary care hospital. Healthy babies delivered normally were included. Very early SSC between mothers and their newborns was initiated in the study group. We studied effective suckling (using modified infant breastfeeding assessment tool [IBFAT]), breastfeeding status at 6 weeks, maternal satisfaction, thermal regulation, baby's weight and morbidity. T-test, Pearson Chi-square test and non-parametric Mann-Whitney test were used through relevant Windows SPSS software version 16.0. We observed that SSC contributed to better suckling competence as measured by IBFAT score (P &lt; 0.0001). More babies in the SSC group were exclusively breastfed at first follow-up visit (P = 0.002) and at 6 weeks (P &lt; 0.0001). SSC led to higher maternal satisfaction rates, better temperature gain in immediate post-partum period, lesser weight loss was at discharge and at first follow-up (all P &lt; 0.0001) and lesser morbidity than the study group (P = 0.006). Very early SSC is an effective intervention that improves baby's suckling competence, maternal satisfaction, breastfeeding rates and temperature control and weight patterns.

Disability is an important indicator to measure disease burden in this group. While some chronic conditions may not be amenable to complete cure, their functional disabilities can be improved with timely and appropriate management. The objective of the following study is to estimate the prevalence of functional disability and study its association with socio-demographic variables and self-reported chronic conditions among elderly persons in a rural area of Haryana. All persons aged 60 years and above in the randomly selected six clusters were included in this community-based cross-sectional study. Information was collected on socio-demographic variables and self-reported chronic conditions. Functional disability was defined as having disability in activities of daily living, or blindness or hearing impairment, or a combination of these. In multivariate analysis, backward stepwise logistic regression was carried out to study the association between the independent and dependent variables, after adjusting for confounding variables. Among the 836 participants studied, the prevalence of functional disability was estimated to be 37.4% (95% confidence interval: 34.2, 40.7). The prevalence was less among men (35.9%) than women (38.8%). The prevalence increased with age, was more common among persons who were not currently married, had diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Functional disability is common among elderly persons in the rural area. Community-based interventions are needed to address them. Management of chronic conditions should include prevention and control of associated disability. ","684":"Breast and cervical cancers are two major cancers among Indian women. Analysis of trends would help in planning and organization of programs for control of these cancers.

The reform era during the post-nineties is replete with many new trends in organizational strategies which could have led to crises in health services. The salient crises need to be dissected from a larger societal crisis and the specific crises in the health services system. It is evident that non-accessibility and non-availability and the sub-optimal functioning of the primary health centers are perennial issues which could not be addressed by indigenous, imposed or cocktail reforms (such as National Rural Health Mission) and by targeting as these only tinker with the health services. Needless to reiterate that there is a need to address the social dimensions which fall outside the technical sphere of health services.

However even before the declaration and more so since, countries have diverse interpretations of Universalism, each setting it in the context of its own health care model. These have ranged from the minimalist to the more comprehensive welfare state. Today, as health statistics reveal, the crisis has deepened, not only in the developing world but also in the developed world. It is important to debate the nature of the crisis and understand current policy initiatives and their ideological legitimations. The paper attempts to trace, clarify and account for the shifts in international discourse on universal health care (UHC). It argues that the idea of UHC is still with us, but there have occurred substantial shifts in discourse and meaning, shaped by changing international and national contexts and social forces impinging on health systems. The current concept of universal health coverage has only a notional allusion to universality of Alma Ata and disregards its fundamental principles.

Child feeding practices were measured with Composite Child Feeding Index comprising of age-appropriate, multiple, infant and young child feeding (IYCF) indicators and expressed in standardized IYCF score. Weight and length of the children were measured and the nutritional status was assessed using World Health Organization Growth Standard 2006. Standardized IYCF score was significantly lower in undernourished children than those with normal grades. Per unit increase in standardized IYCF score was likely to reduce the prevalence of underweight, stunting and wasting by 2-3% after adjusting for other variables. Low\/ very low HFS, low SLI and female gender were associated with underweight and stunting.

Subsequently, all suspected cases seeking treatment from A (H1N1) treatment centers and their contacts were tested. Laboratory confirmed cases were hospitalized and treated with antivirals according to national guidelines. We reviewed the surveillance data to assess the morbidity and mortality due to A (H1N1) in the state of Andhra Pradesh (population-76,210,007) during the period from May 2009 to December 2010. We obtained the line-list of suspected (influenza like illness as per World Health Organization case definition) and laboratory confirmed cases of A (H1N1) from the state unit of integrated disease surveillance project. We analyzed the data to describe the distribution of case-patients by time, place and person. During May 2009 to December 2010, a total of 6527 suspected (attack rate: 8.6\/100,000) and 1480 (attack rate: 1.9\/100,000) laboratory confirmed cases were reported from the State. Nearly 90% of the suspected and 93% of the confirmed cases was from nine districts of Telangana region, which includes Hyderabad. Nearly 65% of total confirmed cases were reported from Hyderabad. The attack rate was maximum (2.6\/100,000) in the age group of 25-49 years. The cases peaked during August-October. 109 case-patients died (Case fatality ratio: 7%) and most (80%) of these patients had comorbid conditions such as diabetes (24%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20%), hypertension (11%) and pregnancy (11%). Case fatality was higher (16%) among patients who were older than 60 years of age compared with other age groups. In Andhra Pradesh, H1N1 transmission peaked during August-October months and predominately affected adults. Case fatality was higher in patients older than 60 years with comorbid conditions.

However, apart from the shortages and unequal distribution, the workforce has fallen short of responding to the public health challenges of 21 st century also because of primarily the traditional training of health professionals. Although, health professionals have made enormous contributions to health and development over the past century, the 20 th century educational strategies are unfit to tackle 21 st century challenges. One of the key recommendations of the Lancet Commission on Education of Health Professionals is to improve health through reforms of professional education by establishing networks and partnerships which takes advantage of information and communication linkages. The primary goal of this manuscript is to highlight the potential of networks and partnerships in advancing the agenda of educational reforms to revitalize public health education in India. It outlines the current status and expanding scope of public health education in India, existing networks of public health professionals and public health education institutions in the country, and opportunities, advantages and challenges for such networks. Although, we have networks of individuals and institutions in the country, there potential to bring about change has still not being utilized fully and effectively. Immediate collaborative efforts could be directed towards designing and adaptation of competency driven curriculum frameworks suitable of addressing public health challenges of 21 st century, shifting the current focus of curriculum to multidisciplinary public health outlook, developing accreditation mechanisms for both the programs and institutions, engaging in creating job opportunities and designing career pathways for public health professionals in public and private sector. These efforts could certainly be facilitated through existing networks.

There are numerous reasons why it is important to improve quality of healthcare, including enhancing the accountability of health practitioners and managers, resource efficiency, identifying, and minimizing medical errors while maximizing the use of effective care and improving outcomes, and aligning care to what users\/patients want in addition to what they need. \"Quality in health is doing the right things for the right people at the right time, and doing them right first time and every time.\" Quality can also refer to the technical quality of care, to nontechnical aspects of service delivery such as clients' waiting time and staff's attitudes, and to programmatic elements such as policies, infrastructure, access, and management. In this oration\/article quality initiatives like Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) and National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) of Government of India (GOI), which concentrate on improving the quality of infrastructure of vast rural health facilities including sub-center, primary health center, and community health center has been taken into account with focus on improving quality of health services also. United Nation Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with the GOI has proposed introducing quality assurance program for accessing and improving the quality of services at public sector health facilities.

As India becomes more and more developed and we have greater means at our disposal, our response to our health challenges must reflect our changing health and socio-economic status. India faces enormous challenges in the area of women's and children's health. India is one of the few countries that have recorded substantial decline in maternal mortality. India is still far from achieving the target set in the millennium development goals. Despite several growth-orientated policies adopted by the government, the widening economic, regional, and gender disparities are posing challenges for the health sector. About 75% of health infrastructure, medical manpower, and other health resources are concentrated in urban areas where 27% of the populations live. To reduce this double burden of diseases, public health has to focus on health promotion, and disease prevention and control, while taking into consideration the social determinant of health. The focus of public health is to bring about change at the policy level not only for preventing disease but also for the health promotion through organized action at societal level.

However, geological factors like frequent glaciations, flooding, and changing of course of rivers has led to iodine deficiency in soil. As a result everyone remains at risk of IDD, if optimum intake of iodine is not sustained. Evolution of the IDD control program in India has been a dynamic process. The model of IDD control program in India provides important lessons for successful implementation of a national health program. In formulating National Health Programs; policy environment, scientific inputs, political will, and institutional structure for decision making are necessary but not sufficient. Continuous and dynamic generation of reliable and representative state and national level data, proactive recognition of values of key stakeholders and addressing them through sustained advocacy, development of partnerships among stakeholders, institutional continuity, and mentorship are critical for achieving sustainability of results.

Subjects were interviewed for the tobacco usage status, followed by clinical assessment of periodontal status. Prevalence of calculus, periodontal pockets of 4-5 mm depth and loss of attachment of 0-3 mm and 4-5 mm was significantly more frequent among current tobacco users. The subject with smoking and chewing tobacco has an odds ratio (OR) 1.6 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.14-2.31) and OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.38-2.28) respectively.

The knowledge on the modes of transmission and methods of prevention of HIV was high. Although, 53.0% of the study participants perceived themselves not to be at risk of contracting HIV infection, 80.6% were engaged in risky sexual practices within a year preceding the study. Significantly more participants with multiple sexual partners, past and present history of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) perceived themselves not to be at risk (P= 0.001, 0.008 and 0.001 respectively).

Hence, it is important to evaluate the awareness of health-care providers of the association between periodontal diseases and pre-term birth. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to random samples representing general medical practitioners (GMPs), general dental practitioners (GDPs) and Gynecologists for this study. A knowledge score was calculated for correct answers to 11 survey questions related to oral health effects during pregnancy and compared among the three groups. In this study, 133 physicians, 135 dentists and 100 Gynecologists completed the questionnaire. More GDPs (67.4%) than GMPs (56.4%) and Gynecologists (63%) reported there was an association between periodontal disease and pre-term low birth weight.

Evidence shows that such sexual behavior pre-disposes to sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. This paper tried to investigate the correlates of premarital sexual behavior among male and female business process outsourcing (BPO) employees to highlight the gender differences that exist in relation to it. Data were collected from 526 unmarried BPO employees during behavioral surveillance survey in Chennai, in the year 2009. The results showed that about one-third of respondents (males - 39.6%, females - 26.1%) had experienced premarital sex. Men reported having had their first sexual intercourse at 12 years and women at 16 years of age. While the prevalence of premarital sex was found to be high, the percentage using a condom during last sex was also high, especially, among the female employees (82.4%). Logistic regression showed that monthly individual income, work in shifts, migration, peer influence and friends with previous sexual experience were significant predictors of premarital sex among the male BPO employees. Visit to night clubs was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of premarital sex among the female employees. The study concludes that there is a significant gender dimension in the premarital sexual behavior among the BPO employees and that even as the sexual behavior of the young people is transitioning; their ability to negotiate safe sex behavior is also increasing. It is recommended to enhance efforts to advocate safe sex behavior among young adults employed in the BPO industry.

Estimated costs of care in published literature do not reflect the actual expenses of individual households. Hence, a household budget approach was undertaken to arrive at the costs of dementia care in India. We identified and listed the different components of care, classified the applicability of care for the different components with respect to mild, moderate, and severe cases. This framework was utilized to assign costs of care and arrive at the household costs of care for a Person with Dementia (PwD) in both urban and rural areas. The total expense was similar to that reported by individual households. The annual household cost of caring for a person with dementia in India, depending on the severity of the disease, ranged between INR 45,600 to INR 2,02,450 in urban areas and INR 20,300 to INR 66,025 in rural areas. Costs increased with increasing severity of the disease process. The costs of informal care contributed to nearly half of the total costs either in rural or urban area. With increasing severity, proportion of medical costs decreased while social cost increased. Medical costs in rural areas were nearly one-third of the total costs as against less than one-fifth in urban areas. The household budget model realistically estimated the household costs of care. It is hoped that the comprehensive and generic framework would prompt health professionals, researchers, and policy makers in India to catalyze geriatric health services, particularly for care for PwD.

The future of child birth in the form of test tube babies, surrogate motherhood through new reproductive and cloning technology will introduce undreamt of possibilities in the sexual arena. Surrogacy is a method of assisted reproduction whereby a woman agrees to become pregnant for the purpose of gestating and giving birth to a child for others to raise. In some jurisdictions the possibility of surrogacy has been allowed and the intended parents may be recognized as the legal parents from birth. Commercial surrogacy, or \"Womb for rent\", is a growing business in India. In our rapidly globalizing world, the growth of reproductive tourism is a fairly recent phenomenon. Surrogacy business is exploiting poor women in country like India already having with an alarmingly high maternal death rate. This paper talks about paternity issues and women's right to health in context of surrogacy. Government must seriously consider enacting a law to regulate surrogacy in India in order to protect and guide couples going in for such an option. Without a foolproof legal framework, patients will invariably be misled and the surrogates exploited. ","736":"Inequity and poverty are the root causes of ill health. Access to quality health services on an affordable and equitable basis in many parts of the country remains an unfulfilled aspiration. Disparity in health care is interpreted as compromise in 'Right to Life.' It is imperative to define 'essential health care,' which should be made available to all citizens to facilitate inclusivity in health care. The suggested methods for this include optimal utilization of public resources and increasing public spending on health care. Capacity building through training, especially training of paramedical personnel, is proposed as an essential ingredient, to reduce cost, especially in tertiary care. Another aspect which is considered very important is improvement in delivery system of health care. Increasing the role of 'family physician' in health care delivery system will improve preventive care and reduce cost of tertiary care. These observations underlie the relevance and role of Primary health care as a key to deliver inclusive health care. The advantages of a primary health care model for health service delivery are greater access to needed services; better quality of care; a greater focus on prevention; early management of health problems; and cumulative improvements in health and lower morbidity as a result of primary health care delivery.

Studies reveal that tobacco abuse is rising in this age group in India. A cross sectional survey was carried out in two coeducational high schools of Anandanagar village of Singur block, Hooghly district, West Bengal among 276 students of VIII-IX standard to study the knowledge and abuse of tobacco and to find out influencing socio-demographic factors. Knowledge score was higher in females, students from nuclear families, and those with literate parents. Low prevalence of tobacco intake was obtained among the students, with 9.8% reported having ever used smokeless tobacco and 4.3% ever smoked. Tobacco intake was higher among those with a history of parental tobacco intake. Continued information education and communication (IEC) activities should be conducted by the school authorities, with involvement of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and parents for primary prevention.","761":"To develop a prediction model for dengue fever\/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF\/DHF) using time series data over the past decade in Rajasthan and to forecast monthly DF\/DHF incidence for 2011. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model was used for statistical modeling. During January 2001 to December 2010, the reported DF\/DHF cases showed a cyclical pattern with seasonal variation. SARIMA (0,0,1) (0,1,1) 12 model had the lowest normalized Bayesian information criteria (BIC) of 9.426 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 263.361 and appeared to be the best model. The proportion of variance explained by the model was 54.3%. Adequacy of the model was established through Ljung-Box test (Q statistic 4.910 and P-value 0.996), which showed no significant correlation between residuals at different lag times. The forecast for the year 2011 showed a seasonal peak in the month of October with an estimated 546 cases. Application of SARIMA model may be useful for forecast of cases and impending outbreaks of DF\/DHF and other infectious diseases, which exhibit seasonal pattern. ","762":"Biostatistics plays an important role in measuring, understanding, and describing the overall health and well-being of a population. Biostatistics as a subject evolved from the application of statistics in various research aspects of biology, biomedical care, and public health. However, with a recent increase in number of health and pharmacy related research, the demand for trained biostatisticians is also increasing. The present paper is an attempt to undertake a situational analysis of biostatistics education in India. A systematic, predefined approach, with three parallel strategies was used to collect and assemble the data regarding training in biostatistics in India. Our study results show that there is paucity of programs providing specialized training in biostatistics in India. Only about 19 institutions in India are offering various courses in biostatistics\/medical statistics\/health statistics\/biometry. It is important to look into the current capacity building initiatives in this domain. Some other means for giving importance to biostatistics could be by making it a separate branch\/specialization in a majority of the institutions, particularly in medical colleges.","763":"Rubella is an acute, usually mild viral disease. However, when rubella infection occurs just before conception or during the first 8-10 weeks of gestation, it causes multiple fetal defects in up to 90% of cases, known as Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). It may result in fetal wastage, stillbirths and sensorineural hearing deficit up to 20 weeks of gestation. Rubella vaccine (RA 27\/3) is highly effective and has resulted in elimination of rubella and CRS from the western hemisphere and several European countries. Review of several studies documents the duration of protection over 10-21 years following one dose of RA27\/3 vaccination, and persistent seropositivity in over 95% cases. Studies in India show seronegativity to rubella among adolescent girls to vary from 10% to 36%. Although due to early age of infection resulting in protection in the reproductive age group, incidence of rubella in India is not very high. However, due to severity of CRS coupled with introduction of RCV in private sector and in some of the states which is likely to lead to sub-optimal coverage and resulting higher risk of rubella during pregnancy in the coming decades, it is imperative to adopt the goal of rubella elimination. As in order to control measles, the country has adopted strategy of delivering second dose of measles through measles campaigns covering children 9 months to 10 years of age in 14 states, it is recommended to synergize efforts for elimination of rubella with these campaigns by replacing measles vaccine by MR or MMR vaccine. Other states which are to give second dose of measles through routine immunization will also have to adopt campaign mode in order to eliminate rubella from the country over 10-20 years. Subsequently, measles vaccine can be replaced by MR or MMR vaccine in the national schedule.","764":"Home to 25% of the world's population and bearing 30% of the Global disease burden, the South-East Asia Region [1] of the World Health Organization has an important role in the progress of global health. Three of the eight million development goal (MDG) goals that relate to health are MDG 4, 5, and 6. There is progress in all three goals within the countries of the region, although the progress varies across countries and even within countries. With concerted and accelerated efforts in some countries and certain specific areas, the region will achieve the targets of the three health MDGs. The key challenges are in sustainable scaling up of evidence-based interventions to improve maternal and child health and controlling communicable diseases. This will require continued focus and investments in strengthening health systems that provide individual and family centered comprehensive package of interventions with equitable reach and that which is provided free at the point of service delivery. Important lessons that have been learnt in implementing the MDG agenda in the past two decades will inform setting up of the post MDG global health agenda. This article provides a snap shot of progress thus far, key challenges and opportunities in WHO South-East Asia Region and lays down the way forward for the global health agenda post 2015.","765":"","766":"","767":"","768":"Swine-flu is a viral fever caused by a new mutated strain Influenza A virus subtype H1N1, which infects humans. Pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1\/2009) virus was detected in the first quarter of 2009 in the west coastal region of North America and spread very rapidly to the other countries during April-June, 2009. This study was conducted to assess the epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 strains using a cross-sectional study design in a tertiary hospital. The symptomatic patients attending the flu outpatient department (OPD)\/emergency from August 2009 to April 2011 at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Nagpur were included using a standard case definition. A total of 67 (27.01%) samples from 247 patients were pandemic influenza A\/H1N1 positive. None of the patients had a history of foreign travel, whereas 23.88% of the patients gave history of travel to an endemic area. Overall, 22.38% of the patients came in contact with proven cases of pandemic H1N1. pH1N1 transmission activity has increased since May 2010.","769":"A community-based, longitudinal interventional study was conducted in a slum in north-east (NE) Mumbai, using a pretested, semi-structured proforma and a pre- and follow-up interview schedule to assess the male health clinic (MHC) strategy as an approach for the control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in males. The focus groups that emerged for behavior change communication (BCC) activities were clients in second and third decades of life, unmarried and married but not staying with wife, clients with no permanent place of occupation, clients with habit of alcohol, and illiterate clients. Postintervention, there was an overall increase in STI knowledge score, alcohol habit score, and high-risk sexual activity score. Less than 50% of the clients received advice on substance abuse and information on consequences of STI\/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study concluded that MHC strategy is an effective approach for control of STIs in males and recommended strengthening of the weaker components of the strategy with focus on the important client groups.","770":"Domestic accidents are worldwide health problems. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the rural field practice area of Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences, Bangalore. A total of 5419 individuals were selected from 30 clusters (villages) using cluster sampling technique. Of the 5419 study population, 50.9% (2748) were males and the rest were females. The prevalence of domestic accidents in the rural community was found to be 9.6% (522 individuals who had sustained domestic accidents), was found to be more in females compared with males, which was statistically significant with P-value =0.0077 (Z value =9.09).

Past sexual practice of PLWHAs revealed that 93.4% males were polygamous, compared to 16.4% females. Of them, 45.7% males and 92.8% females reported sex with a nonregular sex partner (NRSP) in 1 year. Consistent condom use was low in both sexes. Current sexual practice showed that more than four-fifth (87.9%) of the new patients and two-thirds (68.9%) of the indoor patients were currently sexually active in 1 month recall period (P=3.79, Z=0.0000). However, consistent condom use was found only in 35.5% indoor patients and 15.5% of new patients and the difference was statistically significant.","772":"The burden of neurological illness is much higher in developing countries. Neurological disorders in these countries are mainly due to poverty and malnutrition. Spectrums of diseases are also different in comparison with developed countries. Lack of resources, ignorance, and overpopulation make it very difficult and challenging to tackle this problem. Majority of the patients are seen by general practitioners who have little knowledge about neurological illnesses. Most of the countries have very few or no neurologist. There is a greater need of taking neurological care at primary care level where majority of the patients struggle with epilepsy, stroke and neuroinfections.","773":"Chronic arsenic toxicity due to drinking of arsenic-contaminated water has been a major environmental health hazard throughout the world including India. Although a lot of information is available on health effects due to chronic arsenic toxicity in adults, knowledge of such effect on children is scanty. A review of the available literature has been made to highlight the problem in children. Scientific publications on health effects of chronic arsenic toxicity in children with special reference to psychological issues are reviewed. The prevalence of skin abnormalities such as pigmentation change and keratosis, the diagnostic signs of chronic arsenic toxicity, vary in various arsenic-exposed children population in different regions of the world. The occurrence of chronic lung disease including pulmonary interstitial fibrosis has been described in arsenic-exposed children in Chile. Affection of intellectual function has also been reported to occur in arsenic-exposed children studied in Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. Methylation patterns of arsenic in children aggregate in families and are correlated in siblings, providing evidence of a genetic basis for the variation in arsenic methylation. Chronic arsenic toxicity due to drinking of arsenic-contaminated water causes significant morbidity in children resulting in skin lesions, lung disease, and defect in intellectual function.","774":"Iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs) are the most common cause of preventable brain damage globally. The strategy of prevention and control of iodine deficiency is based on iodine supplementation. Edible salt iodization and iodized oil injections are the two most commonly used vehicles for iodine supplementation. The objective of the study was to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the two programs of iodine supplementation, i.e., iodized salt program (ISP) and iodized oil program (IOP) against no preventive program (NPP) option. The study was conducted in 1990 in the state of Sikkim in India. The costs were calculated on the assumption of universal coverage of ISP and coverage of IOP among all children aged 0-14 years and women in the age group of 15-44 years. Direct and indirect cost of ISP and direct cost of IOP was computed based on the costs of year 1991. The discount rate taken was 10% and all the costs were converted to the year 2010 using wholesale price index (WPI) data. Consequences in terms of health effects, Social\/emotional effects, and resource use were included. The discounted cost of ISP and IOP was Rs. 59,225,964 and Rs. 46,145,491, respectively. In ISP, 64.1% of the total cost was required for salt iodization, 17.6% for monitoring, and 18.3% for communication. In IOP, 50.9% of the costs were required for iodized oil; rest was for syringes and needles, manpower expenses, travel, and communication. Total resource saving was Rs. 95,566,220 for ISP and Rs. 92,177,548 for IOP. Incremental benefit for ISP was Rs. 36,340,256 and Rs. 46,032,057 for IOP. The cost-benefit ratio for ISP was 1.61 and 2.00 for IOP. IOP has a higher cost-benefit ratio for prevention of IDDs than ISP in the state of Sikkim, India. ","775":"The core functions of public health agencies at all levels of government are identified as assessment, policy development, and assurance. However, the public health agencies in India are struggling with issues of access, inefficiency, and inequity. There has been failure in terms of health service delivery by public sector. Health Policy is being increasingly recognized as a discipline that has much to offer developing countries in addressing the problems related to policy, governance, and regulatory failure. However, the information about skill-oriented courses on health policy especially from the context of translating public health science into policy action is incomplete and limited. This paper attempts to address this knowledge gap and stimulate discussion in this direction.","776":"Reproductive tract infection (RTI) represents a major public health problem in India. Women are either not aware of the symptoms of RTI or refuse to seek health care due to economic and time constrains unless suffering from alarming symptoms. To find out the prevalence of women with suggestive symptoms of RTI; to identify clinical and cytological abnormalities among the symptomatic women and to find out association between socio-demographic profile and risk factors with RTI symptomatic and cytology positive patients. A total of 385 married women in reproductive age group residing in Baligori sub-center area in Tarakeswar block of Hooghly district, West Bengal, India, were screened for symptom suggestive of RTI; symptomatic women went through gynecological examination and cancer cervix screening by Pap smear. Analysis of results was done by Odds ratio and multivariate logistic regression. Overall, 23.6% of the study population had symptoms suggestive of RTI. Most of them (68.1%) had abnormal vaginal discharge. Among the symptomatic women, cytology proved that 24.4% were suffering from acute cervicitis, 4.7% from A Squamous Cell of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS) and 2.3% from Low Grade Intra epithelial Lesion (LSIL) Squamous. Statistically significant association was observed for age, number of children, contact history of husband, pond bathing, menstrual hygiene, intra uterine device insertion, non-usage of barrier method, and history of abortion among women symptomatic for RTI and asymptomatic women. Prevalence of suggestive symptoms of RTI in women was found to be high (23.6%), and among them 7% had cervical dysplasia. Therefore, enhancing awareness and organizing screening camps are absolute necessity and must be held at frequent intervals to curb the menace due to cervical cancer. ","777":"Reducing maternal mortality is one of the major challenges to health systems worldwide, more so in developing countries that account for nearly 99% of these maternal deaths. Lack of a standard method for reporting of maternal death poses a major hurdle in making global comparisons. Currently much of the focus is on documenting the \"number\" of maternal deaths and delineating the \"medical causes\" behind these deaths. There is a need to acknowledge the social correlates of maternal deaths as well. Investigating and in-depth understanding of each maternal death can provide indications on practical ways of addressing the problem. Death of a mother has serious implications for the child as well as other family members and to prevent the same, a comprehensive approach is required. This could include providing essential maternal care, early management of complications and good quality intrapartum care through the involvement of skilled birth attendants. Ensuring the availability, affordability, and accessibility of quality maternal health services, including emergency obstetric care (EmOC) would prove pivotal in reducing the maternal deaths. To increase perceived seriousness of the community regarding maternal health, a well-structured awareness campaign is needed with importance be given to avoid adolescent pregnancy as well. Initiatives like Janani Surakhsha Yojna (JSY) that have the potential to improve maternal health needs to be strengthened. Quality assessments should form an essential part of all services that are directed toward improving maternal health. Further, emphasis needs to be given on research by involving multiple allied partners, with the aim to develop a prioritized, coordinated, and innovative research agenda for women's health.","778":"Advances in medicine have increased the life expectancy resulting in an increase in the geriatric population all over the world, and their proportion will only continue to rise in the coming years. It is known that the elderly bear a significant burden of morbidity, which is why health systems globally spearheaded by the WHO are waking up to the need for better geriatric health services. This includes India, whose health system continues to grapple with the health challenges of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. This article enumerates the various government policies and programs, constitutional and legal provisions available for the care of the elderly, and concludes that they are grossly inadequate to deal with the various physical, psychological, and emotional needs of the aging population. Mainstreaming of geriatric health to address the health needs of the elderly at all levels of health care, both in the public and the private sectors, giving due importance to multidimensional rehabilitative services and terminal care, involving NGOs and voluntary organizations, and stepping up social security in old age are the recommended measures for improving geriatric health in India.","779":"The updated Thai Red Cross Intradermal (TRC-ID) regimen is the most effective strategy for India as it uses only 40% volume of vaccines in comparison with intramuscular (IM) when 0.5 ml vial is used and 20% when 1-ml vial is used; hence, the cost-effectiveness of intradermal (ID) regimen further increases when 1 ml vial is used. To improve the compliance of ID, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) given free of cost is the ideal solution. For availability and avoiding administrative delays, universal ID delivery of PEP is the answer. ID is safe, effective, and well tolerated. Technique of ID can be learned easily. Universal ID with 1 ml is the ethical solution, which is easy to administer and monitor, economical, effective, and imparts early immunity (Five E's).","780":"The magnitude of Non Communicable diseases demands urgent attention. Common, preventable risk factors underlie most NCDs. These include behavioural risk factors and metabolic risk factors. The prevalence of these, varies between income groups and differs with gender. Majority of events occur in individuals with modest elevations of multiple risks rather than with significant elevation of a single risk factor. The need of the hour is to adopt a process which addresses the upstream determinants through enabling people, to increase control over their health and its determinants, thereby promoting and sustaining good health The answer lies in Health Promotion which involves changing behaviour at multiple levels. In order to change, there is need to understand and apply the models which have been widely used to empower people to make healthy choices. These include the Health Belief, Self-Efficacy, Social Learning and Self-empowerment models.Changing behaviour, however, is a process, not an event. Different strategies are most effective at different Stages of Change. The contextual determinants of health and health behaviour also significantly influence the risks of NCDs.Till date, there has been limited focus on these issues. We urgently, need a close look at policies and their impact on health. With increasing burden of NCDs, the Health Sector will face strain on services delivery and budgets. Special policies and programs are necessary for the disadvantaged poor to address their differential vulnerabilities and risks. The unfinished agenda of NCD prevention and control needs to be addressed urgently with an integrated comprehensive framework of Health Promotion.","781":"","782":"","783":"","784":"","785":"To evaluate pattern of visual impairment in school children from low-income families in Kolkata, India, an institutional cross-sectional study was conducted among 2570 children of 10 primary schools.

The Global Youth Tobacco Survey was completed by secondary school students (N = 534) from municipal and private schools in Mumbai. Overall, the number of students who reported ever use of tobacco was quite low (5.1%). There was no significant difference in exposure to media messages between users of tobacco, areca nut, and nonusers. There were significantly higher numbers of ever users of tobacco in private compared to municipal schools. There was a significant association between exposure to marketing and promotions and intention to quit, but not with the other exposure variables. Media exposure may be related to intention to quit but not to quitting behavior.","787":"A cross-sectional study was conducted among 199 (104 urban, 95 rural) male students of classes VIII and IX, of two schools, in urban and rural areas of West Bengal to compare the prevalence of protective factors, mental health issues, and violence among the urban and rural adolescents using a self-administered questionnaire. Higher proportion of urban students than rural (67.3% vs. 62.5%) reported that their guardians understood their problems. Mental health issues like loneliness (17.3% vs. 9.8%), worry (17.3% vs. 10.7%), and suicidal thoughts (19.2% vs. 14.1%) were higher among urban students.

The scientific and technological revolution of the last century ushered in major and important advances in preventive and curative medical technology which fired a new hope in the fight against communicable diseases. However, the experience over centuries shows that major decline in communicable diseases began much before the advent of modern technology due to advances in the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the people. There has been an attempt by the multilateral and unilateral agencies to supplant the expedient of technological interventions like vaccination campaigns as a substitute to socio-economic advancement in the third world countries. The dividends of this approach have been equivocal and have had an effect of distorting public health priorities in the third world. There seems to be an obsession with technology among the policy planners - a phenomenon that we call as techno-centrism; the latest example of which is the pulse polio campaign. This paper draws upon an epidemiological approach to vaccination programs as a tool to unravel this phenomenon.","792":"Oral health is an essential component of health throughout life.

Primarily, milk get contaminated before milching, from the cattle feed, from sources\/materials used during the processing of milk as well as improper handling of the milk during the pre- and postprocessing period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of household practices on milk contaminants. Samples of pasteurized as well as unpasteurized milk (Vendor's milk) were analyzed for AFM1, pesticide residues, and heavy metals. Simulating the household practices, the impact of boiling on these contaminants was assessed. The contaminant Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) was detected at a concentration ranging from 0.071-0.075 ppb in unpasteurized as well as pasteurized milk samples analyzed during the course of study. Moreover, boiling had no impact on the quantity of AFM1 present in the milk. Pesticides and heavy metal contents were found to be within acceptable limits in all the milk samples tested. Mycotoxins especially aflatoxins in cattle feed and their consequential presence in milk and milk products is a serious concern world over as they are reported carcinogens. These fungal toxins are resistant to high temperatures and may lead to various health hazards.

Various processes including pasteurization, boiling or storage under refrigerated conditions are undertaken to minimize the microbial contamination of milk. This study was undertaken with an objective to evaluate the effect of household practices on the microbiological profile of milk. Milk samples of pasteurized, ultra heat treated (UHT) as well as unpasteurized milk (Vendor's milk) were collected. The effect of different storage practices and treatments on the microbiological profile (standard plate count (SPC), coliform, E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus, yeast and moulds, anaerobic spore count, and Listeria monocytogenes) of milk was studied using National\/ International Standard Test Methods. Average SPC in vendor's milk was found very high as compared to pasteurized milk. Coliform, yeast and moulds, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in the samples of vendor's as well as pasteurized milk. Boiling the milk reduces SPC and kills the other microorganisms. Storage of boiled milk under room temperature or refrigerated condition resulted in a similar increase in SPC at the end of 24 h, but storage of un-boiled milk even under refrigerated conditions increased SPC manifold after 24 h. The pasteurization process and hygienic conditions at the milk processing units along with cold chain of milk from suppliers to end users needs improvement. Currently, even pasteurized milk does not match the microbiological standards. It is recommended that milk should be boiled before consumption and refrigerated for storage to improve its shelf life\/keeping quality. ","802":"It is a common practice to process milk before consumption. Processing generally involves boiling, addition of sugar and\/or condiments, dilution with water, etc. The boiled milk is stored for subsequent use either at room temperature or under refrigerated conditions. The purpose of this study was to see the effect of household practices on the nutritional profile of milk. Different types of pasteurized milk samples: standardized, double toned, full cream, and unpasteurized milk were analyzed. The effect of household practices on the nutritional profile of all these milk samples was studied using National\/International methods. Boiling of milk increased the concentration of most of the components and minerals except for vitamins A, B 3 , B 5 , and B 12 where the decrease observed was 21%, 13%, 3%, and 21%, respectively. Addition of water decreased the concentration of minerals and vitamins. Addition of sugar increased the energy and condiments increased total solids, carbohydrate and minerals content but led to a decrease in the vitamin content. Storage of milk led to a decrease in total solids by 19% and vitamins A, B 3 , B 5 , and B 12 by 26%, 17-19%, 23%, and 18-26%, respectively. The pH was not influenced by any of the household practices. Every step during household practices in the handling of milk reduces its nutritional profile and significantly affects the quality. Vitamins play a very important role in health and loss during household processing becomes an interesting attribute that requires further research in detail. ","803":"Milk and dairy products from animal sources (cow's milk or buffalo's milk) are an important part of Indian diet and its consumption starts at an early age. The purpose of this study is to understand the processing, storage and modifications carried out before bovine milk is fed to the infants and compare it with recommendations by Health Care Professionals (HCPs). The study involved assessments involving HCPs and mothers of children below 1 year of age through both qualitative and quantitative methods. Feeding recommendations by HCPs were assessed through a quantitative method. The children are commonly initiated on bovine milk post 3 months of age. The milk is not covered while boiling in 70% cases and boiled at suboptimal temperature (moderate: 62% or low: 31%). Half of the families store milk outside refrigerators openly in the kitchen or rooms. The milk is modified in the majority of cases (81%) before being fed. Modification of the milk was often done with sugar (85%), followed by water (49%), biscuits, fennel seeds, cardamom or infant cereals before feeding the baby. Addition of water was more prevalent among mothers of infants between 3 and 6 months. HCPs do not advise consumption of bovine milk by infants unless there is no other option available. A clear gap exists between recommended and actual practices for infant feeding in India. There is a huge opportunity to educate mothers on importance of breast feeding and benefits of implementing appropriate processing, storage, and consumption practices of bovine milk. ","804":"","805":"'Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)' was implemented in India to promote institutional deliveries among the poorer section of the society. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Bankura district among 324 women who delivered in last 12 months selected through 40 cluster technique to find out institutional delivery rate, utilization of JSY during antenatal period and relation between cash benefit under JSY during antenatal period and institutional delivery. Overall institutional delivery rate was 73.1% and utilization of JSY among eligible women was 50.5%. Institutional delivery (84.0%), consumption of 100 iron-folic acid tablets (46.0%) and three or more antenatal check-ups (91.0%) were better in women who received financial assistance from JSY during antenatal period than other women. After adjustment for socio-demographic factors, JSY utilization came out to be significantly (P=0.031) associated with institutional deliveries. The study showed that cash incentive under JSY in antenatal period had positive association on institutional deliveries.","806":"Community based study on health expenditure is a rarity in India. A Rural Community based longitudinal study was undertaken in Jaulgaon village of Maharashtra, with objectives of finding out the health expenditure contributed by direct treatment, related travel and relevant loss of wages with certain pertinent associated factors. 50% of the village population was studied (N = 256) by pre-designed, pre-tested schedule following WHO guidelines. A monthly house to house interview was conducted over 12 months. During study period, 78% study subjects suffered some illness with mean illness episode 1.74\/person and 6.37\/family without any sex difference. The annual health expenditure of the community was Rs 1,576\/family, 4,31\/person and 2,42\/episode, which was about 4.3% of their income. The major part of the expenditure (82%) was for direct treatment cost, followed by loss of wages (12%) and travel related cost (6%). Expenditure was seen to be significantly associated with family income (P = 0.000) and education (P = 0.006).","807":"Pictorial warnings are effective in promoting smoking cessation as shown by research in the developed countries. This study aims to determine perceptions of Indians about the effectiveness of pictorial health warnings on tobacco packs which existed from May 31, 2009, to December 1, 2011. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in five states of India with 1897 participants (56% males; 54% tobacco users). More tobacco users expressed that the pictorial warnings are inadequate to convey the health impact of tobacco use when compared with nonusers (71.50% vs. 62.75%; P &lt; 0.001). More illiterates when compared with literates expressed their concern that the current pictorial warnings will not motivate them to quit (61.17% vs. 51.01%; P &lt; 0.001). The new warnings implemented from December 1, 2011, in India are also not field-tested. Field testing and assessment of effectiveness of health warnings should be a mandatory requirement for Parties reporting on Article 11 of Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).","808":"Oral cancer is one of the most common life threatening diseases in India. Tobacco and alcohol are considered to be the most risk factors for oral cancer. This study was conducted to investigate the association of tobacco and poly-ingredient oral dip products with oral cancer. A case-control study of 350 cases and 350 controls, over a period of 19 months, between February 2005 and September 2006 was carried out in Pune, India. The self-reported information about the consumption of tobacco, poly-ingredient oral dip products, alcohol, dietary habits and demographic status were collected by a researcher made questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify the risk of substances abuse. The frequency of smoking, smokeless and oral dip products in cases were significantly higher than controls (P &lt; 0.0001). Among smoking types, bidi (P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 4.1 95% CI = 2.4 - 6.9), of smokeless types, chewing tobacco (P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 8.3, 95% CI = 5.4 - 13.0) and mishiri (P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 3.3, 95% CI =2.1 - 5.4), and of oral dip products, consumption of gutkha (P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 12.8, 95% CI =7.0 - 23.7) and supari (P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 6.6, 95% CI =3.0 - 14.8) indicated strong association with oral cancer upon adjustment. This study provides strong evidence that gutkha, supari -areca nut- chewing tobacco (tobacco flakes), bidi smoking and mishiri (tobacco powder, which applied as a tooth and gum cleaner) are independent risk for oral cancer.","809":"A cross-sectional study was conducted on Lucknow highway in Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh to study the knowledge of truck drivers about HIV transmission and prevention and to study the sexual behaviour of these drivers with reference to HIV\/AIDS. Age, marital status, education, income, drinking alcohol, length of stay away from home, knowledge about transmission and prevention of HIV, and HIV-prone behavior of truck drivers were studied. Chi-square, mean, and SD were calculated. In all, 289 (97.6%) drivers had heard about HIV\/AIDS. Only 242 (81.8%) were aware of HIV transmission by heterosexual route. Misconceptions such as HIV transmission by mosquito bites, living in same room, shaking hands, and sharing food were found. Out of 174 (58.8%) who visited Commercial Sex Workers (CSW), 146 (83.9%) used a condom. 38 (12.8%) visited more than 5 CSW in the last 3 months. Time away from home on the road, marital status, alcohol use, and income class were associated with visiting CSW. High-risk behavior was established in the study population. Safe sex and use of condoms need to be promoted among the truck drivers and better condom availability needs to be assured on highways.","810":"A cross sectional study was conducted from February - May 2009 with the objectives to find out profile of injuries among municipal primary school children in Siliguri, West Bengal and to identify the related factor associated with injury. 20% of total primary schools under municipal corporation of the town were selected and a pre-designed, pre-tested schedule was used to assess the profile of injury and associated factors. The Chi square test was usedto determine statistical significance at the 0.05 significance level. Out of 956 participants, a significantly higher injury was observed among males (68%). Open wound injuries were commonest (59.6%) occurring mainly at the extremities. Falls were mainly responsible for overall injuries. Injury at home (41.8%) was also found to be more. Mother education, number of siblings and presence of caregiver were significant related factors to injury.","811":null,"812":"Edible salt iodization and iodized oil injections are the two most commonly used vehicles for iodine supplementation. In year 1989, the state government of Sikkim was planning to implement Iodine Deficiency Disorder control program in state and had following two options to choose from, based on existing knowledge; a) a salt iodization program, b) an iodized oil injection program. No information was available at that point of time on comparative advantages of the above stated two approaches. To identify the most cost-effective alternative for IDD elimination in Sikkim, amongst the following 3 alternatives: a) Iodized salt program (ISP), b) Iodized oil injection program (IOP) to high risk group, c) no preventive program. Study population was the general population of state of Sikkim, India in year 1990. Cost- effective analysis was undertaken comparing 3 alternative programs, targeted towards IDD elimination in state of Sikkim. Identification, measurement and valuation of the costs of ISP and IOP and identification and measurement of the consequences of IDD were done to carry out the cost-effective analysis. Visible goiter person years (VGPY), endemic cretinism, IDD attributable death were used to assess the health consequences\/disease burden of IDD. The cost per VGPY, endemic cretinism and IDD attributable death were Rs 76.67, Rs 24,469 and Rs 9,720, respectively for ISP. The cost per VGPY, endemic cretinism and IDD attributable death were Rs 75.82, Rs 19,106 and Rs 7,709, respectively for IOP. The results of the analysis showed that iodized oil program is more cost-effective for prevention of irreversible IDDs than the iodated salt program in state of Sikkim, India.

To assess the prevalence of domestic violence among the ever married women in reproductive age group and to find out the types of domestic violence and factors associated with it. The study was a community based cross-sectional study, conducted in a slum area of Kolkata. Overall prevalence of domestic violence was 54%, of which 41.9% suffered from both current and lifetime physical and psychological violence. Presence of property, higher per capita income and social support were protective factors against domestic violence, whereas alcohol addiction and multiple sex partners were the important contributory factors for it. The study recommended more social support, awareness and income generation for women in the slum areas. ","814":"This paper analyzes the present processes, products and needs of post-graduate public health education for the health programming, implementation and oversight responsibilities at field level and suggests some solutions for the institutes to adopt or adapt for improving the quality of their scholars. Large number of institutions has cropped up in India in the recent years to meet the growing demand of public health specialists\/practitioners in various national health projects, international development partners, national and international NGOs. Throwing open MPH courses to multi-disciplinary graduate's is a new phenomenon in India and may be a two edged sword. On one hand it is advantageous to produce multi-faceted Public health postgraduates to meet the multi tasking required, on the other hand getting all of them to a common basic understanding, demystifying technical teaching and churning out products that are acceptable to the traditional health system. These Institutions can and must influence public health in the country through producing professionals of MPH\/ MD degree with right attitude and skill-mix. Engaging learners in experimentation, experience sharing projects, stepping into health professionals' roles and similar activities lead to development of relatively clear and permanent neural traces in the brain. The MPH institutes may not have all efficient faculties, for which they should try to achieve this by inviting veterans in public health and professionals from corporate health industry for interface with students on a regular basis. The corporate and public health stalwarts have the capacities to transmit the winning skills and knowledge and also inspire them to adopt or adapt in order to achieve the desired goals.","815":null,"816":"In order to respond to the changing paradigm of public health challenges, India needs adequately trained public health professionals. Public health education is a tool to create public health professionals. Public health education in India is at cross-roads on several fronts. Traditionally, public health education in India was offered through medical schools and was open for medical graduates only. However, recently the country has witnessed an emergence of institutions offering public health programs to nonmedical background graduates. An examination of the history and current status of public health education can provide us with an insight into the evolution of the discipline in the country. This is important as in order to respond to the public health education challenges in the present time, we need to understand the historical directions taken by the discipline in the past. This review captures how the public health education efforts in the country have been aided by concerted actions within the discipline and by an enabling environment and a positive intent at the national level, whereby we can better understand the context for the recent developments in Indian public health.","817":"Traditionally, qualitative studies are founded on interpretative and constructive epistemology. The process of data collection in these studies is longer and intensive. This helps to build a strong rapport with the community, hence enabling to capture the field as naturally as possible. These characteristics provide an ample scope to take care of quality and validity of data. However, in applied situations, data collection is often a truncated activity. This robs away a number of taken-for-granted strengths of traditional qualitative research methods: No time is spent on rapport building; holism is left behind, instead we engage in selection; we focus narrowly on specific phenomenon of concern, divorced from its context; analysis does not evolve out of an iterative process.

The purpose of the study was to determine the association with known risk factors for motor disabilities in two remote villages of North Karnataka (India), where an increased number of disabled people among select communities had been reported. A community based survey was conducted. The selection of study subjects was done through screening, history related with occurrence of musculoskeletal disability, screening and general examination of the affected joints and muscles. Data analysis was done by estimation of percentages. Among the physical disabilities identified, the most common was post-polio residual paralysis. 35.65% (n = 41) subjects had developed paralysis following the administration of an intramuscular injection when they had acute viremia in childhood, indicating that (probably) muscle paralysis would have been provoked by intramuscular injections, resulting in provocative poliomyelitis. Unnecessary injection must be avoided in children during acute viremia state and use of oral polio vaccine should be encouraged.","832":"The problem of high fluoride concentration in groundwater resources has become one of the most important toxicological and geo-environmental issues in India. Excessive fluoride in drinking water causes dental and skeletal fluorosis, which is encountered in endemic proportions in several parts of the world. World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value and the permissible limit of fluoride as per Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) is 1.5 mg\/L. About 20 states of India, including 43 blocks of seven districts of West Bengal, were identified as endemic for fluorosis and about 66 million people in these regions are at risk of fluoride contamination. Studies showed that withdrawal of sources identified for fluoride often leads reduction of fluoride in the body fluids (re-testing urine and serum after a week or 10 days) and results in the disappearance of non-skeletal fluorosis within a short duration of 10-15 days. To determine the prevalence of signs and symptoms of suspected dental, skeletal, and non-skeletal fluorosis, along with food habits, addictions, and use of fluoride containing toothpaste among participants taking water with fluoride concentration above the permissible limit, and to assess the changes in clinical manifestations of the above participants after they started consuming safe drinking water. A longitudinal intervention study was conducted in three villages in Rampurhat Block I of Birbhum district of West Bengal to assess the occurrence of various dental, skeletal, and non-skeletal manifestations of fluorosis, along with food habits, addictions, and use of fluoride containing toothpaste among the study population and the impact of taking safe water from the supplied domestic and community filters on these clinical manifestations. The impact was studied by follow-up examination of the participants for 5 months to determine the changes in clinical manifestations of the above participants after they started consuming safe drinking water from supplied domestic filters and community filter with fluoride concentration below the permissible limit. The data obtained were compared with the collected data from the baseline survey. The prevalence of signs of dental, skeletal, and non-skeletal fluorosis was 66.7%, 4.8-23.8%, and 9.5-38.1%, respectively, among the study population. Withdrawal of source(s) identified for fluoride by providing domestic and community filters supplying safe water led to 9.6% decrease in manifestation of dental fluorosis, 2.4-14.3% decrease in various manifestations of skeletal fluorosis, and 7.1-21.5% decrease in various non-skeletal manifestations within 5 months. Following repeated motivation of participants during visit, there was also 9.7-38.1% decrease in the usage of fluoride containing toothpaste, and 9.8-45.3% and 7.3-11.9% decrease in the consumption of black lemon tea and tobacco, respectively, which are known sources of fluoride ingestion in our body and have an effect on the occurrence of various manifestations of fluorosis following drinking of safe water from domestic and community filters. Increased prevalence of dental, skeletal, and non-skeletal fluorosis was found among the study population. Withdrawal of source(s) identified for fluoride by supplying domestic and community filters, dietary restriction, and other nutritional interventions led to decrease in manifestation of the three types of fluorosis within 5 months. ","833":"The primary health care workers of a district in northern India were trained in the year 2006 for Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) using two different training methods: conventional 8-day training and new interrupted 5-day training. Knowledge and skills may decline over a period of time. Rate of decline may be associated with the type of training. A study was thus conducted to see the retention of knowledge and skills in the two training groups, 3 years after the initial training. This study was done in the Panchkula district of Haryana state in northern India. In the year 2006, 50 primary health care workers were given new interrupted 5-day training and another 35 workers were given conventional 8-day training on IMNCI. Knowledge and skills of the same workers were evaluated in the year 2009, using the same methodology and tools as were used in the year 2006. Data analysis was done to see the extent of decline in knowledge and skills in these 3 years and whether decline was more in any particular training group. Compared to post-training score in the year 2006, composite knowledge and skill scores for Auxilliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and Anganwari workers (AWWs) together declined significantly in the year 2009 from 74.6 to 58.0 in 8-day training group and from 73.2 to 57.0 in 5-day training group (P &lt; 0.001). Follow-up composite scores in the two training groups were similar. Whereas the decline was more for knowledge scores in 8-day training group and for skill score in 5-day training group, the pattern of decline was inconsistent for different health conditions and among ANMs and AWWs. Long-term retention of knowledge and skills in 5-day group was equivalent to that in 8-day training group. Refresher trainings may boost up the decline in the knowledge and skills.

In 1847, Dr Semmelweis Ignac pointed to the link between infection and unclean hands, and demonstrated that washing hands could reduce transmission of puerperal fever (child birth fever), a dreaded disease with high mortality in those days. A cross-sectional study was conducted to find out the extent of germs present in hand, and also the students' perception on hand washing. This was assessed by questionnaire as well as by collection of swab from hand and performing bacteriological culture in the laboratory. In regard to students' perception about the dirty areas of the hands, it was observed that majority (78%) felt palm was likely to be more dirty while less than 70% felt that web spaces could harbor dirt. Almost 86% reported that they washed hands before eating lunch, but only 21.3% said they always used soap while 47.3% never used it. Availability of soap all the time in the school was reported by only 18.4% students. The swabs of 61% children showed potential pathogens. The commonest of these was Staphylococcus aureus which was seen in 44% samples. The students' hands were contaminated before taking food. Although they washed hands before meals, they hardly used soap due to non-availability of soap. The school authority should be asked to keep soaps in the toilets for hand washing.

Data were collected from service providers at CHC through well structured questionnaire at thirteen CHCs situated at Bharatpur District of Rajasthan State. It was found that infrastructure facilities were available in almost all the CHCs, but shortage of manpower especially specialists was observed. Availability of investigative services was found quite satisfactory except ECG. It was also observed that none of the CHCs have fully equipped facility based newborn care services (including newborn corner and newborn care stabilization unit). As per IPHS suggested in the revised draft (2010) important deficiencies were revealed in the studied CHCs of Bharatpur district and by additional inputs such as recruiting staff, improving infrastructure facilities, CHCs can be upgraded.","839":"Preventing maternal death associated with pregnancy and child birth is one of the greatest challenges for India. Approximately 55,000 women die in India due to pregnancy- and childbirth- related conditions each year. Increasing the coverage of maternal and newborn interventions is essential if Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 4 and 5 are to be reached. With a view to accelerate the reduction in maternal and neonatal mortality through institutional deliveries, Government of India initiated a scheme in 2005 called Janani Suraksha Yojna (JSY) under its National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). In Jharkhand the scheme is called the Mukhya Mantri Janani Shishu Swasthya Abhiyan (MMJSSA). This paper focuses on community perspectives, for indentifying key areas that require improvement for proper implementation of the MMJSSA in Jharkhand. Qualitative research method was used to collect data through in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) in six districts of Jharkhand- Gumla, West Singhbhum, Koderma, Deoghar, Garhwa, and Ranchi. Total 300 IDIs (24 IDIs each from mother given birth at home and institution respectively; two IDIs each with members of Village Health and Sanitation Committees (VHSC) \/ Rogi Kalyan Samitis (RKS) from each district) and 24 FGDs (four FGDs were conducted from pools of husbands, mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law in each district) were conducted. Although people indicated willingness for institutional deliveries (generally perceived to be safe deliveries), several barriers emerged as critical obstacles. These included poor infrastructure, lack of quality of care, difficulties while availing incentives, corruption in disbursement of incentives, behavior of the healthcare personnel and lack of information about MMJSSA. Poor (and expensive) transport facilities and difficult terrain made geographical access difficult. The level of utilization of maternal healthcare among women in Jharkhand is low. There was an overwhelming demand for energizing sub-centers (including for deliveries) in order to increase access to maternal and child health services. Having second ANMs will go a long way in achieving this end. The MMJSSA scheme will thus have to re-invent itself within the overall framework of the NRHM.","840":"With changing demographic profile India has more older women than men as life expectancy for women is 67.57 as against 65.46 for men. Gender differences in the aging process reflect biological, economic, and social differences. Both social and health needs of the older women are unique and distinctive as they are vulnerable. The social problems revolve around widowhood, dependency, illiteracy and lack of awareness about the policies and programmes from which they can benefit. Among the medical problems, vision (cataract) and degenerative joint disease top the list, followed by neurological problems. Lifestyle diseases form another single-most important group of health problems in the elderly women. The risk of cardiovascular disease doubles with the outcome being poorer than men. The most common causes of death among women above the age of 60 years are stroke, ischemic heart disease and COPD. Hypertensive heart disease and lower respiratory tract infections contribute to mortality in these women. Common malignancies viz. Cervical, breast and uterus in women are specific to them and account for a sizeable morbidity and mortality. In a study done at Lady Hardinge medical college in Delhi, Hypertension (39.6%) and obesity (12-46.8%) were very common in postmenopausal women. Half or more women had high salt and fat intake, low fruit and vegetable intake and stress. There is a need to recognize the special health needs of the women beyond the reproductive age, to be met through strengthening and reorienting the public health services at all levels starting from primary health care to secondary till tertiary care level with adequate referral linkages. All policies and programs need to have a gender perspective. At present there is lack of sensitization and appropriate training of the health personnel in dealing with the needs of elderly. Women too need to be aware to adopt healthy lifestyle and seek timely care.","841":"","842":"Smoke-free legislation is gaining popularity; however, it must accompany effective implementation to protect people from secondhand smoke (SHS) which causes 600,000 deaths annually. Increasing numbers of smoke-free cities in the world indicate that municipalities have an important role in promoting smoke-free environments. The objectives were to describe the local initiative to promote smoke-free environments and identify the key factors that contributed to the process. Observations were based on a case study on the municipal smoke-free initiatives in Chandigarh and Chennai, India. India adopted the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act in 2003, the first national tobacco control law including smoke-free provisions. In an effort to enforce the Act at the local level, a civil society organization in Chandigarh initiated activities urging the city to support the implementation of the provisions of the Act which led to the initiation of city-wide law enforcement. After the smoke-free declaration of Chandigarh in 2007, Chennai also initiated a smoke-free intervention led by civil society in 2008, following the strategies used in Chandigarh. These experiences resonate with other cases in Asian cities, such as Jakarta, Davao, and Kanagawa as well as cities in other areas of the world including Mexico City, New York City, Mecca and Medina. The cases of Chandigarh and Chennai demonstrate that civil society can make a great contribution to the enforcement of smoke-free laws in cities, and that cities can learn from their peers to protect people from SHS.","843":"This review of legislation, obstacles faced, and challenges to be met, outlines present tobacco control lessons learnt in Thailand. A review of over twenty years of tobacco control experience in Thailand is provided in seven areas including policy formulation and the role of civil society, as well as in essential WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control areas. A descriptive, historical review shows how stakeholders, policies and resources were mobilized in Thailand, and what lessons resource-challenged countries might use from the Thai experience.","844":"Tobacco use is a major public health challenge in India with 275 million adults consuming different tobacco products. Government of India has taken various initiatives for tobacco control in the country. Besides enacting comprehensive tobacco control legislation (COTPA, 2003), India was among the first few countries to ratify WHO the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2004. The National Tobacco Control Programme was piloted during the 11 th Five Year Plan which is under implementation in 42 districts of 21 states in the country. The advocacy for tobacco control by the civil society and community led initiatives has acted in synergy with tobacco control policies of the Government. Although different levels of success have been achieved by the states, non prioritization of tobacco control at the sub national level still exists and effective implementation of tobacco control policies remains largely a challenge.","845":"To examine exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) at home, in workplace, and in various public places in Bangladesh. Data from 2009 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) conducted in Bangladesh was analyzed. The data consists of 9,629 respondents from a nationally representative multi-stage probability sample of adults aged 15 years and above. Exposure to second-hand smoke was defined as respondents who reported being exposed to tobacco smoke in the following locations: Indoor workplaces, homes, government building or office, health care facilities, public transportation, schools, universities, restaurants, and cafes, coffee shops or tea houses. Exposure to tobacco smoke in these places was examined by gender across various socioeconomic and demographic sub-groups that include age, residence, education and wealth index using SPSS 17.0 for complex samples. The study shows high prevalence of SHS exposure at home and in workplace and in public places. Exposure to SHS among adults was reported high at home (54.9%) (male-58.2% and female-51.7%), in workplace (63%) (male-67.8% and female-30.4%), and in any public place (57.8%) (male-90.4% and female-25.1%) 30 days preceding the survey. Among the public places examined exposure was low in the educational institutions (schools-4.3%) and health care facilities (5.8%); however, exposure was high in public transportation (26.3%), and restaurants (27.6%). SHS exposure levels at home, in workplace and public places were varied widely across various socioeconomic and demographic sub-groups. Exposure was reported high in settings having partial ban as compared to settings having a complete ban. Following the WHO FCTC and MPOWER measures, strengthening smoke-free legislation may further the efforts in Bangladesh towards creating and enforcing 100% smoke-free areas and educating the public about the dangers of SHS. Combining these efforts can have a complementary effect on protecting the people from hazardous effect of SHS as well as reducing the social acceptance of smoking both at home and in public and workplaces. Ongoing surveillance in Bangladesh is necessary to measure progress towards monitoring SHS exposure. ","846":"Smokeless tobacco use is on the upswing in some parts of the world, including parts of SEAR. It is therefore important to monitor this problem and understand the possible consequences on public health. Material for this review was obtained from documents and data of the World Health Organization, co-authors, colleagues, and searches on key words in PubMed and on Google. Smokeless tobacco use in SEAR, as betel quid with tobacco, declined with increased marketing of cigarettes from the early twentieth century. Smokeless tobacco use began to increase in the 1970s in South Asia, with the marketing of new products made from areca nut and tobacco and convenient packaging. As a consequence, oral precancerous conditions and cancer incidence in young adults have increased significantly. Thailand's successful policies in reducing betel quid use through school health education from the 1920s and in preventing imports of smokeless tobacco products from 1992 are worth emulating by many SEAR countries. India, the largest manufacturing country of smokeless tobacco in the Region, is considering ways to regulate its production. Best practices require the simultaneous control of smokeless and smoking forms of tobacco. Governments in SEAR would do well to adopt strong measures now to control this problem.","847":"Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) causes an estimated 5% of the global burden of disease, slightly higher than the burden from direct use of tobacco. This review highlights the urgent need to address this ignored public health issue by presenting the evidence and impact of SHS on those exposed using global studies including those from the South-East Asia Region. The burden of morbidity from SHS exposure is higher in low-income countries in Southeast Asia region compared to the rest of the world. SHS exposure affects those most vulnerable, especially women and children. While several countries in the region have enacted legislation which offer protection to those exposed to SHS, most measures are partial and inadequate. As a result, implementation and compliance at national and sub-national level within the countries of the Southeast Asia region is variable. Governments must ensure that legislation mandates comprehensive smoke-free environments in order to provide public health benefit which offers universal protection to everyone and everywhere. Where comprehensive legislation exists, stringent implementation and enforcement, along with awareness building, education and monitoring through regular compliance studies must be done to sustain smokefree status of public places within jurisdictions.","848":"The birth of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) took place in response to the global tobacco epidemic and it became the most important global tobacco control instrument. Duly recognizing tobacco use as an important public health problem and in the wake of rising prevalence of and mortality related to tobacco use, almost all Member States of the South-East Asia Region signed and ratified the WHO FCTC. Following the ratification, Member countries have enacted comprehensive national tobacco control laws and regulations. Most countries have covered some important provisions, such as tax and price measures, smoke-free places, health warnings, a ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, and a ban on tobacco sales to minors. In spite of innumerable constraints and challenges, particularly human, infrastructural and financial resources, Member countries have been doing their best to enforce those legislations and regulations as effectively as possible. In order to educate the general public on the harmful effects of tobacco, mass health campaigns have been organized which are being continued and sustained. However, some of the important areas that need attention in due course of time are tax raises, illicit trade, tobacco industry interference and alternate cropping systems. All Member States in the Region are striving harder to achieving the goals and provisions of the Framework Convention through actively engaging all relevant sectors and addressing the tobacco issue holistically, and thus protecting the present and future generations from the devastating health, social, economic and environmental consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke.","849":"India is at a crucial juncture relating to tobacco control and implementing the recommendations of the WHO FCTC. Tobacco consumption in the country remains alarmingly high in urban as well as rural areas. Smokeless tobacco consumption is very popular among larger masses, including the youth. Cigarette smoking has declined, but bidi use has increased concomitantly. Youth continue to be lured to initiate tobacco consumption through efficient marketing strategies of tobacco companies. The epidemiology of tobacco consumption is markedly varied across the country, with high rates in 15 States. Progress has been made towards tobacco control by the enactment of laws and regulations and the National Tobacco Control Program. Strengthening their implementation and enforcement is the biggest challenge and requires resource inputs. Evidence generation and its translation and utilisation for policy interventions would be useful.","850":"This paper examines the prevalence of current tobacco use among youth and adults in selected member countries of the South-East Asia Region using the data from school and household-based surveys included in the Global Tobacco Surveillance System. Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) data (years 2007-2009) were used to examine current tobacco use prevalence among youth, whereas Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) data (years 2009-2010) were used to examine the prevalence among adults. GYTS is a school-based survey of students aged 13-15, using a two-stage cluster sample design, and GATS is a household survey of adults age 15 and above using a multi-stage stratified cluster design. Both surveys used a standard protocol for the questionnaire, data collection and analysis. Prevalence of current tobacco use among students aged 13-15 varied from 5.9% in Bangladesh to 56.5% in Timor-Leste, and the prevalence among adults aged 15 and above was highest in Bangladesh (43.3%), followed by India (34.6%) and Thailand (27.2%). Reported prevalence was significantly higher among males than females for adults and youth in all countries except Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste. Current use of tobacco other than manufactured cigarettes was notably higher than current cigarette smoking among youth aged 13-15 years in most countries of the Region, while the same was observed among adults in Bangladesh, India and Thailand, with most women in those countries, and 49% of men in India, using smokeless tobacco. Tobacco use among youth and adults in member countries of the region is high and the pattern of tobacco consumption is complex. Tobacco products other than cigarettes are commonly used by youth and adults, as those products are relatively cheaper than cigarettes and affordable for almost all segments of the population. As a result, use of locally produced smoked and smokeless tobacco products is high in the region. Generating reliable data on tobacco use and key tobacco control measures at regular intervals is essential to better understand and respond with effective tobacco control intervention. ","851":"This paper examines the social, cultural, economic and legal dimensions of tobacco control in the South-East Asia Region in a holistic view through the review of findings from various studies on prevalence, tobacco economics, poverty alleviation, women and tobacco and tobacco control laws and regulations. Methods were Literature review of peer reviewed publications, country reports, WHO publications, and reports of national and international meetings on tobacco and findings from national level surveys and studies. Tobacco use has been a social and cultural part of the people of South-East Asia Region. Survey findings show that 30% to 60% of men and 1.8% to 15.6% of women in the Region use one or the other forms of tobacco products. The complex nature of tobacco use with both smoking and smokeless forms is a major challenge for implementing tobacco control measures. Prevalence of tobacco use is high among the poor and the illiterate. It is higher among males than females but studies show a rising trend among girls and women due to intensive marketing of tobacco products by the tobacco industry. Tobacco users spend a huge percent of their income on tobacco which deprives them and their families of proper nutrition, good education and health care. Some studies of the Region show that cost of treatment of diseases attributable to tobacco use was more than double the revenue that governments received from tobacco taxation. Another challenge the Region faces is the application of uniform tax to all forms of tobacco, which will reduce not only the availability of tobacco products in the market but also control people switching over to cheaper tobacco products. Ten out of eleven countries are Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and nine countries have tobacco control legislation. Enforcement of control measures is weak, particularly in areas such as smoke-free environments, advertisement at the point of sale and sale of tobacco to minors. Socio-cultural acceptance of tobacco use is still a major challenge in tobacco control efforts for the governments and stakeholders in the South-East Asia Region. The myth that chewing tobacco is less harmful than smoking tobacco needs to be addressed with public awareness campaigns. Advocacy on the integration of tobacco control with poverty alleviation campaigns and development programs is urgently required. Law enforcement is a critical area to be strengthened and supported by WHO and the civil society organizations working in the area of tobacco control.","852":"Tobacco use is a serious public health problem in the South East Asia Region where use of both smoking and smokeless form of tobacco is widely prevalent. The region has almost one quarter of the global population and about one quarter of all smokers in the world. Smoking among men is high in the Region and women usually take to chewing tobacco. The prevalence across countries varies significantly with smoking among adult men ranges from 24.3% (India) to 63.1% (Indonesia) and among adult women from 0.4% (Sri Lanka) to 15% (Myanmar and Nepal). The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men varies from 1.3% (Thailand) to 31.8% (Myanmar), while for women it is from 4.6% (Nepal) to 27.9% (Bangladesh). About 55% of total deaths are due to Non communicable diseases (NCDs) with 53.4% among females with highest in Maldives (79.4%) and low in Timor-Leste (34.4%). Premature mortality due to NCDs in young age is high in the region with 60.7% deaths in Timor Leste and 60.6% deaths in Bangladesh occurring below the age of 70 years. Age standardized death rate per 100,000 populations due to NCDs ranges from 793 (Bhutan) and 612 (Maldives) among males and 654 (Bhutan) and 461 (Sri Lanka) among females respectively. Out of 5.1 millions tobacco attributable deaths in the world, more than 1 million are in South East Asia Region (SEAR) countries. Reducing tobacco use is one of the best buys along with harmful use of alcohol, salt reduction and promotion of physical activity for preventing NCDs. Integrating tobacco control with broader population services in the health system framework is crucial to achieve control of NCDs and sustain development in SEAR countries.","853":"","854":"","855":"","856":"A multi-cluster study (survey) was carried out by department of ENT KG Medical University, Lucknow from July 2003 to August 2004 in rural and urban population of Lucknow district to estimate prevalence and causes of hearing impairment in the community.

Overall hearing impairment was seen in 15.14% of rural as opposed to 5.9% of urban population. A higher prevalence of disabling hearing impairment (DHI) in elderly and deafness in 0-10 years age group was seen. The prevalence of sensorineural deafness necessitating hearing aids was 20% in rural and 50% in urban areas respectively. The presence of DHI was seen in 1\/2 urban subjects and 1\/3rd of rural counterparts.

Information were collected on the sex of new born babies and other socio demographic characteristics of selected couples, including number of births, history of spontaneous and induced abortions and the preferred sex of siblings. Data were collected from a total of 302 families using a pre-tested interview schedule. There were 698 births of which 351(50.3%) were males and 347 females. The sex ratio at birth was 988 females for 1000 males. There were 84 abortions of which 60(71.4%) were induced and 24 (28.6%) were spontaneous. The reason stated for induced abortions was related to sex of the child in 31(51.7%) of the cases and in 26(83.9%) of these, the abortions were induced to prevent the birth of a female child. There was a preference for male children in the study families. Gender bias and its implications are discussed.","858":"World Health Organization global disease update (2004) points out injuries as the sixth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood. A descriptive hospital based study was conducted to find out the common types of unintentional injuries among children admitted for management of unintentional injuries in Pediatric Surgery department and Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary care hospital of North Kerala and to find out the contributing risk factors. A total of 400 children admitted during the study period of 6 months of 2009 constituted the study population. Mechanical injuries comprising of Road traffic accidents and accidental fall were the major cause of unintentional injuries (36%), followed by Poisoning (22.3%). A higher proportion of unintentional injuries were noted to occur among children of younger mothers, overactive child, children belonging to extended or joint families, child left alone or with friends, pre-school children, male child and from urban dwellings. The study highlights the need to identify the different types of unintentional injuries and the risk factors of childhood injuries which require hospitalisation. Identification of risk factors will help to formulate strategies aimed at risk reduction and prevention of childhood injuries.","859":"A cross-sectional study among 701 school children (12-16 years) was conducted in Aligarh to find out the prevalence of hypertension and to correlate school going adolescent's blood pressure with age, sex, height and weight. The weight was taken by a standardized weighing machine while height was measured using a standard stediometer. Blood pressure measurements were taken by a mercury sphygmomanometer. The distribution of blood pressure by anthropometric characteristics were studied. Mean, standard deviation and correlation coefficient were used for statistical analysis. The overall prevalence of hypertension was found to be 9.4%. Blood pressure of both gender appear to have positive correlation with anthropometric characteristics. Study recommends that children must be screened regularly for blood pressure so that remedial measure can be initiated as early as possible.","860":"Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) schemes have shown largely favorable changes in the health seeking behavior. This evaluation study assesses the process and performance of an Additional Cash Incentive (ACI) scheme within an ongoing CCT scheme in India, and document lessons. A controlled before and during design study was conducted in Madhya Pradesh state of India, from August 2007 to March 2008, with increased in institutional deliveries as a primary outcome. In depth interviews, focus group discussions and household surveys were done for data collection. Lack of awareness about ACI scheme amongst general population and beneficiaries, cumbersome cash disbursement procedure, intricate eligibility criteria, extensive paper work, and insufficient focus on community involvement were the major implementation challenges. There were anecdotal reports of political interference and possible scope for corruption. At the end of implementation period, overall rate of institutional deliveries had increased in both target and control populations; however, the differences were not statistically significant. No cause and effect association could be proven by this study. Poor planning and coordination, and lack of public awareness about the scheme resulted in low utilization. Thus, proper IEC and training, detailed implementation plan, orientation training for implementer, sufficient budgetary allocation, and community participation should be an integral part for successful implementation of any such scheme. The lesson learned this evaluation study may be useful in any developing country setting and may be utilized for planning and implementation of any ACI scheme in future. ","861":"The main objective of the study has been to identify trajectories of health seeking behaviour of the urban poor, particularly their use of the private health sector, with the aim to identify strategies to improve quality of health care for this burgeoning population. This article presents findings from a slum settlement in Delhi where ethnographic sub-studies were carried out over two years among private health providers and selected households alongside a survey of household expenditure patterns. The primary research tools were in-depth interviews with practitioners and key informants as well as observations of clinical interactions. Illness narratives and case studies were documented over two years. The software package q.s.r. Nvivo was used for coding and content analysis. It was found that almost 90% of the respondents exclusively depend on local unlicensed and unregistered practitioners for basic primary health care. Long distances, time-consuming procedures, rude behaviour and, in many cases, bribes that had to be paid to staff in the hospitals were cited as major deterrents to utilising government facilities. Despite the public health consequences of inappropriate treatment protocols and misuse of drugs by these untrained private providers, in the absence of a structured urban primary health care system in the country, they seem to be the only alternative for the burgeoning urban poor in vast metros such as Delhi.","862":"Public health engineering can play an important and significant role in solving environmental health issues. In order to confront public health challenges emerging out of environmental problems we need adequately trained public health engineers \/ environmental engineers. Considering the current burden of disease attributable to environmental factors and expansion in scope of applications of public health \/ environmental engineering science, it is essential to understand the present scenario of teaching, training and capacity building programs in these areas. Against this background the present research was carried out to know the current teaching and training programs in public health engineering and related disciplines in India and to understand the potential opportunities and challenges available. A systematic, predefined approach was used to collect and assemble the data related to various teaching and training programs in public health engineering \/ environmental engineering in India. Public health engineering \/ environmental engineering education and training in the country is mainly offered through engineering institutions, as pre-service and in-service training. Pre-service programs include diploma, degree (graduate) and post-graduate courses affiliated to various state technical boards, institutes and universities, whereas in-service training is mainly provided by Government of India recognized engineering and public health training institutes. Though trainees of these programs acquire skills related to engineering sciences, they significantly lack in public health skills. The teaching and training of public health engineering \/ environmental engineering is limited as a part of public health programs (MD Community Medicine, MPH, DPH) in India. There is need for developing teaching and training of public health engineering or environmental engineering as an interdisciplinary subject. Public health institutes can play an important and significant role in this regard by engaging themselves in initiating specialized programs in this domain.","863":"Following a suspected outbreak of scrub typhus in Kurseong, Darjeeling, the Armed Forces Medical College, Pune was requested by the National Institute of Epidemiology and the State authorities to undertake investigation of the ongoing scrub typhus outbreak and suggest containment measures. The epidemic team undertook clinical, entomological and serological studies to understand the local disease pattern and delineate high risk areas, host diversity by rodent trapping using Sherman traps, mite fauna diversity, abundance and vector species identification by phase contrast microscopy for preparation of electronic database and rodent and human serological studies by Weil Felix and PCR. The results indicate no association of scrub typhus with age and sex (P=0.37 and 0.74 respectively). The maximum cases occurred amongst the tea garden workers (73%) in the age group of 25-44 years. The predominant clinical presentation was fever (100%) with headache (75%), lymphadenopathy (45%) and presence of eschar (76.7%). The dominant host species (50% of trapped rodents) was shrew Suncus murinus, the index animal for scrub typhus, which contributed maximally to the vector abundance (52.96%) with a chigger index of 61.56. The trombiculid mite Schoengastiella ligula was the vector species much against the expected mite vector Leptotrombidium deliense, in the area. The study found the presence and abundance of vector species which corroborated well with the occurrence of cases in the various localities within the subdivisions. The study thus establishes Schoengastiella ligula as the vector of scrub typhus outbreak in Kurseong, Darjeeling. Preventive and containment measures with emphasis on reduction of man - vector contact were suggested to the state authorities to contain the outbreak. ","864":"Health is determined not only by medical care but also by determinants outside the medical sector. Public health approach is to deal with all these determinants of health which requires multi sectoral collaboration and inter-disciplinary coordination. Although there have been major improvements in public health since 1950s, India is passing through demographic and environmental transition which is adding to burden of diseases. There is triple burden of diseases, viz. communicable, non-communicable and emerging infectious diseases. This high burden of disease, disability and death can only be addressed through an effective public health system. However, the growth of public health in India has been very slow due to low public expenditure on health, very few public health institutes in India and inadequate national standards for public health education. Recent years have seen efforts towards strengthening public health in India in the form of launch of NRHM, upgradation of health care infrastructure as per IPHS, initiation of more public health courses in some medical colleges and public health institutions and strengthening of public health functional capacity of states and districts under IDSP.","865":"During the past 60 years, a number of infectious diseases have been targeted for eradication or elimination, with mixed results. While smallpox is the only one successfully eradicated so far, campaigns on yaws and malaria brought about a dramatic reduction in the incidence in the beginning of the campaign but ultimately could not achieve the desired goal. There is again a renewed interest in disease eradication. The World Health assembly in May 2010 passed a resolution calling for eradication of measles by 2015; the target of polio eradication still remains elusive. In view of these developments, it is appropriate time to revisit the concept of disease eradication and elimination, the achievements and failures of past eradication programmes and reasons thereof, and possibly apply these lessons while planning for the future activities. This paper based on the Dr. A.L.Saha Memorial Oration describes various infectious diseases that have been targeted for eradication or elimination since 1950s, the potential direct and indirect benefits from disease eradication, and the issues and opportunities for the future.","866":"A cross sectional observational study was carried out in three districts of West Bengal by following observational, quantitative and qualitative methods during July to December 2006 to find out the extent of utilization, strengths, weaknesses and gap as well as suggest recommendations in connection with health care delivery system for the state of West Bengal, India. A total of 672 episodes of illnesses were reported (2 weeks recall) by the study population of the three selected districts in three geographically separated divisions of West Bengal. None did seek care from any health facilities for treatment in case of 221 (32.89%) episodes; especially from tribal areas where in case of 76.19% none sought any health care from any facilities depended on their home remedies. In rest of episodes the (451), majority preferred government health facilities (38.58%), followed by Unqualified quacks (29.27%) due to low cost as well as living in close proximity, 27.27% preferred qualified Private practitioners and only 4.88% preferred AYUSH, as a first choice. Referral was mostly by self or by close relatives\/families (61%) and not by a doctor. Awareness is required to avoid unnecessary referral. Cleanliness of the premises, face-lift, and clean toilet with privacy and availability of safe drinking water facilities could have an improved client satisfaction in rural health care delivery systems. This could be achieved through community participation with the involvement of PRI. However, as observed in the study RCH services including Family Planning as well as immunization services (preventive services) were utilized much better while there was a strong need of improvement of Post Natal Care, otherwise, Neonatal and Maternal mortality and morbidity will continue to be high.","867":"","868":"","869":"","870":"","871":"","872":"Structural and qualitative evaluation of Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) is important to determine actual status of the programme in the field settings and to uncover the concealed gaps.

Adolescence is the critical period when the first initiation of substance use takes place. Interventions at the adolescent age are effective to bring about lifestyle modifications. A community-based, cross-sectional study was carried out among 260 randomly selected adolescents in an urban slum area, with the objective of studying the prevalence and determinants of substance use among adolescents. The adolescent age group was selected as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) (10 - 19 years). The overall prevalence of substance use was 32.7%. About 31% initiated substance use at 13 - 15 years of age, and the reason was peer pressure in 52.9%. Education of the study subject, education of parents, and substance use by parents and by peers were significantly associated with substance use. Children and parents should be educated to prevent substance use.

Prevalence of (Reproductive tract infection) RTI \/ STI (Sexually transmitted infections) symptoms in the last 12 months was found to be 13.9 and 13.6% among males and females, respectively. The most common symptom was dysuria and vaginal discharge among males and females, respectively. Almost half of the STI symptomatics (52% male, 50% female) did nothing for their symptoms. Better health-seeking behavior was observed among females. About 9.4% of the males and 47% of the females sought advice from the clinic \/ hospital \/ health workers. Strengthening of activities of the existing national program among the general population is needed to build a positive health-seeking behavior that will ensure success of the syndromic management of RTI \/ STI.","875":"Diabetes has emerged as one of the world's biggest health problems and its prevalence is increasing at an alarming rate. This study was conducted to find out the magnitude of frank and undetected diabetes mellitus, including impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) among persons in rural Karnataka, and its relationship with associated risk factors like hypertension and anthropometry. This was a population-based, cross-sectional study on 1370 participants in the field practice area of KBN Medical College, conducted from April 2009 to March, 2010. Diabetes mellitus was noted among 19.78% of the participants, with an additional 12.04% with impaired glucose tolerance. Hypertension observed among participants with diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance was 65.13 and 53.94%, respectively.

This was a cross-sectional, two-site, hospital-based study. The study was undertaken in 2005; as a result of phased roll out of free HAART as part of National AIDS Control Program, patients at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) hospital were receiving free HAART, while patients at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had to bear out-of-pocket expenses for HAART. Adherence was defined as not having missed even a single pill over the previous 4-day period on self-reporting. Adherence at AIIMS was 47%, whereas it was 90% at LNJP. The difference was statistically significant. Multivariate analysis showed that nonadherence was associated with not having been told about the importance of HAART, having to pay out-of-pocket for HAART and reported continued risk behavior post HAART. With the provision of free HAART, adherence is likely to be high. Emphasis should be given on simultaneous recruitment of counselors, and physicians should be made aware about the need to inquire and counsel patients against continued risk behavior.

This study was conducted during September 2005 to February 2006 to develop rapid detection system for Salmonella from poultry samples. In the present study 300 poultry samples were screened for Salmonella. Earlier, isolation and identification of Salmonella from clinical samples by traditional cultural techniques required laborious procedures which can last upto 7 days, whereas amplification of DNA sequences unique to an organism using the PCR improves both the speed of detection and the level of sensitivity at which organisms can be detected and has been increasingly used to identify several bacterial species from food and clinical samples. In this study Salmonella were rapidly detected by targeting invA gene, giving PCR product of 284 bp size. Therefore this technique can be used for the screening of Salmonella in the routine testing.","954":"A community based study in a village of Delhi was carried out during February 2004-May 2005 to assess visual outcomes in population more than 40 years age utilizing a paramedical worker.

Since the specialist referral service was also available within the same village, very high success rate in the current study may not be replicated to the same extent in other settings.","955":"Re-orientation of medical education in India has not been fully successful because the development of medical teacher, a critical component has not been adequately addressed. Faculty development is a key factor. We have identified six shifting trends in faculty development that can contribute to the development of a medical educator in India. These include a shift from: One time training to continuing professional development; information based approach to project based approach; training to scholarship; lack of accountability to accountability and recognition; individual efforts to networking; and role of treatment providers to health promoters. We have discussed how these shifts are in tune with the global trends. We recommend that the initiatives taken in India in the recent past, viz., constitution of a Task Force by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, establishment of several medical education centers should be harnessed by forming a national working group. Such a group would provide policy directions for faculty development which will lead to a concrete plan for implementation and thereby addressing a critical component of the re-orientation of medical education.","956":"Noise is a major health threat in occupations where its level exceeds the permissible level (90dB). Most serious health effect is Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Objective of the present study was to find out any relationship between occupational noise exposure and hearing impairment of the employees in a heavy engineering industry. A cross-sectional study was conducted during May 2005 to April 2006 in a selected heavy engineering industry in Kolkata. All the employees working in the factory were included in the study. Data were collected through interview, physical examination, audiometry and environmental noise survey. Among the total of 278 employees of this study, 235 employees were exposed above the permissible occupational noise level (90dB), out of whom 82 (34.90%) employees were deaf which was much more than the deafness among the nonexposed workers 3 (6.98%). Hearing impairment increased as exposure level increased and this was statistically significant (chi2 = 17.97, df = 2, p = 0.0001). Hearing impairment also increased with duration of exposure (chi2 = 7.12, df = 2, p = 0.0284). Hearing impairment is associated with occupational noise exposure and thus pre-placement and periodical medical examination is of vital importance.

Methicillin Resistant Staphylococci constituted 4.16% of the Staphylococcus aureus strains. Colonization rate of MRSA in the pediatric population in the community was detected to be 0.31%. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus nasopharyngeal carriage, though not at very high rate, is prevalent in the pediatric population in the community.","961":"Public health importance of hand washing was known since 19th century. Many researchers also highlighted how hand washing could bring down the incidence of diarrhea, ARI &amp; other diseases. To find out the extent of hand washing as practiced by the community, to what extent suggested steps of hand washing was followed and to assess the changes in bacteriological count of hand before and after hand washing. A community based cross sectional study was carried out during January-February 2007 among 161 respondents in and around Kolkata through interview, observation of hand washing in some situations as well as carrying out microbiological test. 100% respondents interviewed practiced hand washing after defecation either with soap (59%) or with plain water, ash &amp; mud (41%). But 64%, 51.6% and only 21.7% practiced hand washing before preparation of food; after using urinals; after changing the babies' nappies and disposing their feces respectively. Only 16.1% respondents washed their hands as per the recommended time of 15-30 seconds. Majority (75%) dried hands with apparently unclean materials. 90.7% followed step1 but none followed all the steps. Swab collection before and after hand washing revealed a decrease in colony count in 60% of the samples. It can be concluded that extent of desirable practices regarding hand washing is still lacking and needs to be emphasized. ","962":"","963":"To assess the various factors influencing utilization and non-utilization of RCH services and extent of client satisfaction. A cross-sectional study was conducted during October to December 2008 at two selected blocks of Varanasi district, Uttar Pradesh. Principal study subjects were 509 women having children less than 12 months old, selected through a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected through in-depth interview and Focus Group Discussions conducted among the beneficiaries of the services. The study revealed that utilisation of the RCH services in the government facilities was higher among the backward classes than the general category; higher the level of education the lower was the utilisation of government services. Over all, 16% of the respondents were not satisfied with government facilities. 25% of the SC category was not satisfied with the services in spite of being the main users. Among RCH services utilization was highest (89%) for antenatal care services (ANC). 41.6% respondents did not receive any Post Natal Care (PNC) after their most recent birth. About 30% deliveries were at home out of which only 10% received PNC whereas out of 70% institutional deliveries about 80% received PNC. Overall 16.3 % of the respondents were not satisfied with the services provided by government health facilities. Around 16% and 14% were not satisfied with the behavior of medical officer and the health workers respectively and non-satisfaction was highest among SC category. All health facilities need to be made functional according to Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) of NRHM. ","964":"Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) has been implemented in the country to enhance institutional deliveries. This study assess the gaps in delivery services and utilization of resources at Basic and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care Centers (BEmOCs, &amp; CEmOCs), accredited sub centers and private hospitals in district Jaipur, Rajasthan. The study was undertaken during October-December 2008 in 31 selected health facilities (5 CEmOCs, 4 BEmOCs, 14 accredited subcentres and 8 accredited private hospitals) in district Jaipur. Both primary and secondary data was collected using qualitative and quantitative techniques, by facility survey, interview of service providers (specialists, medical officers, and paramedical staff) and beneficiaries. There is an increase in institutional deliveries following implementation of JSY. Though the normal deliveries were conducted 24 hours by the BEmOCs and CEmOCs however the necessary drugs like parental antibiotics, mesoprostol, magsulf etc were in short supply and use of partograph was absent at the health facilities. The quality of emergency obstetric care services was still poor due to the lack of blood storage units and anesthetists in CEmOCs. Private accredited hospitals fared better as they had the manpower and managed more complicated cases as compared to government facilities, for caesarean sections. The accredited sub centers were nonfunctional negating the very objective of accreditation. Community is still unaware of the 24 hour stay post delivery and provision of grievance redressal system. The quality aspects of institutional deliveries are far from desired level mostly because of lack of resources, both manpower and materials; non achievement of IPHS standards etc. The service quality related to antenatal, intranatal and postnatal care need to be improved. The JSY is perceived as an effective scheme by the beneficiaries but gaps in resources and lack of quality of services needs to be adequately dealt with. ","965":"To study the structure and functioning of Rogi Kalyan Samitis (RKS) in community health centers of Uttarakhand state and observe the availability and utilization of funds by RKS. A cross-sectional study was conducted during September - December 2008 in two districts of the state. Eight community health centers (CHC), four from each district were selected by simple random sampling. In-depth interview of all member secretaries and members of RKS, 20% of in-patients and exit interview of 10% OPD patients of selected CHCs was done with interview schedules. In each CHC, two focus group discussions were conducted (one for males and one for females). RKS was established in all selected CHCs, according to the guidelines issued under the NRHM. The main functions performed by the RKS included infrastructural strengthening of the CHCs, improvement in basic facilities, ensuring provision of emergency medical care, free medicines, basic laboratory and radiological investigation, transport facilities and hospital waste management. The flow of the central grant was found to be smooth. The expenditure however is below the mark in absence of predefined protocols. Only 53.30% of total funds available were utilized during the study period. Approximately three-fourth of the funds was utilized in civil work (32.70%), furniture and electrical works (28.28%) and in fuel (12.98%). More than 80% of all patients informed about availability of medicines, drinking water facilities, clean toilets and rooms in CHCs. However, most of the community members were not aware regarding the existence, objectives and the activities of RKS.

This cross-sectional study was conducted in three blocks (one each from rural, urban and tribal area) of Udaipur district during October-December 2008. From each block 60 ASHAs were selected randomly, thus a tola of 180 ASHAs were included. Besides interviewing the ASHAs, focus group discussions were also conducted for primary data collection. The study assessed the performance based incentives system to ASHAs during the last six months. The study revealed that almost 50% ASHA's in the studied blocks were covering population ranging from 1000-1500. All the ASHA has good coordination with local community and they are participating in community meetings regularly. All the ASHAs received incentives for the cases of sterilization; 55.5 percent urban, 85.7 percent rural and 82.7% tribal ASHAs received it on the same day when sterilization was done. Half of the urban, 35% of the rural and 56.7% of tribal ASHAs got incentive less than Rs. 250 in last 6 months (less than 50\/- per month). Common cause identified for dissatisfaction was less incentives compared to their work, especially for the ASHA working in tribal areas. Timely release of incentives, adequate cooperation from staff such as ANMs, AWW, hospital staff and improved community awareness are needed for better performance of ASHAs. ","967":"To find out the status of utilization of MCH services after the induction of the indigenous system of medicine (ISM) lady doctors and CNMs for 24 x 7 services and the acceptance of this innovation by the health system and the community. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted during October to November 2008 in 10 blocks of 5 selected districts in Uttar Pradesh. Study subjects (CMO, MO I\/C, ISM lady doctors, GNMs, PRI members) were interviewed and FGDs were also conducted. Shortages of medical and paramedical staff as well as facilities for institutional delivery at the district and block level were revealed. Only 6 out of 16 ISMs were trained. Knowledge of the ISMs\/GNMs was lacking in many essential components of MCH including identifying high-risk pregnancy, high-risk newborn for urgent and timely referral. 36% could identify high-risk pregnancy and only 18% used partograph during labour. About 68% of the ISMs\/GNMs were dissatisfied regarding honorarium, 59% with work conditions and 55% with delivery instrument. Induction of ISMs\/GNMs were welcomed and accepted by medical officers and panchayets. Delay in payment of honorarium and pay disparity between MBBS doctors and ISM lady doctors and lack of proper logistic support were some of the problems facing the ISMs\/GNMs. For sustenance, in service training, provision of transport and accommodation, logistic support, well equipped labour room, timely monitoring and supervision, removal of pay disparities need to be ensured. The contractual appointment should also be made permanent and lucrative.

A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted in three selected districts of Jharkhand state during September-December 2008. Data was collected through in-depth interview using semistructured schedules with State Programme Managers, Chief Medical Officers, District programme managers, staff of MMU and beneficiaries. The scheme provided curative and diagnostic facilities like X-ray, ultra sound, and blood test to the poor and under-served areas. More than 90% of clients reported availability of medicines in MMUs. However, more than 90% of them had no prior information about the day and time of visits by the MMUs. Some of the operational difficulties being faced by the scheme were reported to be vibrations of generator disturbing the lab investigations, poor condition of the road, unwillingness of doctors to go in far-off areas and heavy workload. The scheme of MMUs has been successful in providing health services to the poor and under-served areas. ","969":"To study the functioning of District Programme Management Units in the delivery of health services in various districts of Madhya Pradesh.

The study subjects were Chief Medical and Health Officers, programme managers, assistant managers and data officers at state and district levels. Datawas collected from the respondents in a pre-designed, pre-tested in-depth interview schedule. Around 70% of districts submitted their Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) on time, 30% were unable to do so because of inadequate staff and frequent changing of the reporting format. The District Programme Managers (DPMs) were not satisfied with their fixed salary. But they were satisfied with their job. In some districts the space available for the functioning of District Programme Management Unit (DPMU) are rather too small. Standardized uniform formats and guidelines should be made available to all DPMUs at the beginning of planning process. A comprehensive pre-service training for the DPMU staff including practical sessions, field exposure on district health planning, financial management, technical and administrative issues needs to be ensured. ","970":"To understand the logistics and supply management system of drugs at different levels within the district health care delivery system of Dharbanga in Bihar. This was a cross-sectional study in 3 Primary Health Centres (PHCs), 3 Additional Primary Health Centres (APHCs) and 6 Subcentres (SCs) during September-December 2008. The study subjects were Civil Surgeon, Pharmacists, Medical Officers, ANMs. Data was collected using qualitative and quantitative techniques from different stakeholders. The health centers were severely understaffed and drug stores are managed by unqualified\/untrained pharmacists. Drug list available was not fully matching with the need\/requirement of the population. The vital and essential drugs required for various health centers were of short supply or unavailable in medical stores. MOs were unaware of budget allocation\/allotment for their centers. Demand estimation of the drug items were not done scientifically hence quantity of drugs supplied was not in consonance with community needs. The existing guidelines were not followed as a result drugs like Zinc, Misoprostol and Magsulf were not available at the PHCs or APHCs. The storage and transportation facilities of drugs were found to be poor. Community members were not satisfied with the availability of drugs. The logistic and supply system of drugs in Darbhanga district is very weak, hence the needs of the catering population related to medicines was not fully met. ","971":"The key objective of the study was to evaluate the coverage and functioning of the referral transport system under NRHM in block PHCs of district Patna in Bihar. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted during October-November, 2008 in 16 block PHCs in Patna. In-depth interviews were conducted at 811 households where there was an occasion to transfer a patient to a hospital in the previous two months time. Medical officer in-charge and civil surgeon of the district were also interviewed. Besides, focus group discussions were conducted with the community members and leaders regarding the functioning of referral transport. Availability of the referral transport services was irregular mainly due to deputation of the vehicles for flood relief activities or other purposes. 93 (11.5%) of respondents used the PHC transport facilities, of which 52.7% got it instantaneously. 'Dial an ambulance 102' services were mainly used by urban clients. The system was following an arbitrary cost structure. 84.2% of the clients belonging to below poverty line had to pay for the service and are afraid of availing the services. Inadequate number of ambulances in PHCs, unequipped ambulances, lack of life saving equipments, 24 hours duty by single driver, arbitrary cost frame work and urban preference for services were some of the factors leading to unpopularity of the scheme. ","972":"To seek opinion regarding the procurement and spending of untied fund provided to health centers and Village Health and Sanitation Committees (VHSCs) in selected districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh. It was a cross sectional descriptive study conducted during September-December 2008. The multi-stage random sampling technique was adopted to select the districts, health facilities and VHSCs. The data was collected using semi structured interview schedule, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with ANMs for qualitative information, review of the records of health centers and VHSCs. The concept of untied fund was perceived to be a very good one at all levels. Guideline for utilization of untied fund was either not available or if available, was not clear to concerned personnel. The decision of expenditure of untied funds of CHCs and PHCs was taken in the meeting of Rogi Kalyan Samiti (RKS), but members from other sectors such as PRI, education, revenue department etc. usually did not attend the meeting. Most of Medical Officer in charges (MOICs) were not aware regarding availability of untied fund. About 50% of ANMs were not able to expend the money due to non co-operation of Pradhan. In majority of the cases the decision regarding the utilization of untied fund was taken by ANM herself instead of VHSC meeting. Regular update and orientation to the service providers about the untied fund and its efficient utilization, strict monitoring of utilization of untied fund at each and every level is needed.

An analysis for treatment seeking behavior of 5989 inpatients which implied to 6726 hospitalized cases due to five ailments namely, heart, diarrhea, tuberculosis, urinary and gynecology diseases in India during the last 365 days prior to survey date has been revealed in this paper using data from the 60th round of National Sample Survey, 2004. Multivariate logistic regression model has been adopted to understand the correlates of being inpatients and of opting private hospitals. It is evident that crowded household, being female, having higher educational level, living in lower income households, and living in urban residents have lower chances of being hospitalized compared to their respective counterparts. Maximum people opted for expensive private health sector which accounts for around 59 per cent. This study also reveals that many people had some form of treatment before being an inpatient where 59 per cent had past treatment. Patients from the highest quintile of MPCE have higher chances of being hospitalized and also of choosing costly private health care sector. Significant differences were found within age, sex, education, residence and monthly per capita consumption expenditure for hospitalization. Older age groups, highly educated and urban patients have higher instances of choosing a private sector.

It has traditionally been difficult to monitor disease burden and trends in India, even more difficult to detect, diagnose, and control outbreaks until they had become quite large. In an effort to improve the surveillance and response infrastructure in the country, in November 2004 the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) was initiated with funding from the World Bank. Given the surveillance challenges in India, the project seeks to accomplish its goals through, having a small list of priority conditions, many of which are syndrome-based at community and sub center level and easily recognizable at the out patients and inpatients care of facilities at lowest levels of the health care system, a simplified battery of laboratory tests and rapid test kits, and reporting of largely aggregate data rather than individual case reporting. The project also includes activities that are relatively high technology, such as computerization, electronic data transmission, and video conferencing links for communication and training. The project is planned to be implemented all over the country in a phased manner with a stress on 14 focus states for intensive follow-up to demonstrate successful implementation of IDSP. The National Institute of Communicable Diseases chosen to provide national leadership may have to immediately address five issues. First, promote surveillance through major hospitals (both in public and private sector) and active surveillance through health system staff and community, second, build capacity for data collation, analysis, interpretation to recognize warning signal of outbreak, and institute public health action, third, develop a system which allows availability of quality test kits at district and state laboratories and\/or culture facilities at identified laboratories and a national training program to build capacities for performing testing and obtaining high quality results, fourth, there must be a process established by which an appropriate quality assurance program can be implemented and fifth, encourage use of IT infrastructure for data transmission, analysis, routine communication (E-mail etc) and videoconferencing for troubleshooting, consultations and epidemiological investigations. These five activities must be addressed at the national level and cannot be left up to individual states\/districts.","1010":"Towards sustainable elimination of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), the existing programme needs to be monitored through recommended methods and indicators. Thus, we conducted the study to assess the current status of IDD in Purba Medinipur district, West Bengal. It was a community based cross-sectional study; undertaken from October 2006-April 2007. 2400 school children, aged 8-10 years were selected by '30 cluster' sampling technique. Indicators recommended by the WHO\/UNICEF\/ICCIDD were used. Subjects were clinically examined by standard palpation technique for goitre, urinary iodine excretion was estimated by wet digestion method and salt samples were tested by spot iodine testing kit. The total goitre rate (TGR) was 19.7% (95% CI = 18.1-21.3 %) with grade I and grade II (visible goitre) being 16.7% and 3% respectively. Goitre prevalence did not differ by age but significant difference was observed in respect of sex. Median urinary iodine excretion level was 11.5 mcg\/dL and none had value less than 5 mcg\/dL. Only 50.4% of the salt samples tested were adequately iodised (&gt; or = 15 ppm). The district is in a phase of transition from iodine deficiency to iodine sufficiency as evident from the high goitre prevalence (19.7%) and median urinary iodine excretion (11.5 mcg\/dL) within optimum limit. But, salt iodisation level far below the recommended goal highlights the need for intensified efforts towards successful transition.

However, the seriousness of this public health problem has remained largely under-recognized so far. Luckily the preventive measures are simple and not difficult to implement. Public health strategies are essential to control the burgeoning problem. Lifestyle modifications can reduce the incidence of obesity, hypertension and diabetes. These diseases account for a significant proportion of CKD cases. Active involvement of the primary care physicians is vital for early detection of CKD with retardation of its progress, since nephrologists do not see the patients in the early stages. The role of community health specialists is essential to organize health education programs and screening camps, form active patient support groups; and incorporate the prevention program in the various tiers of the health-care system. Availability of optimal nephrology services in peripheral hospitals can rehabilitate most cases of end-stage renal disease, and also prevent the illegal organ trade, which keeps rearing its ugly head at regular intervals in India.","1016":"An outbreak of measles was reported from Shivpuri district of Madhya Pradesh, India.

On the other hand, 22.6% distinctly expressed their unwillingness in this regard. Main reasons cited by unwilling\/not sure students were: 'low level of personal interest in population-based research' (39.7); 'such activity was not contributory in getting admission to postgraduate courses' (33.2%); and 'Not so useful in likely job responsibilities' (21.2%). Almost half (48.9%) of the students chose para-clinical phase as most suitable period of MBBS for such learning exposure. Pre-clinical; clinical; and internship phases were preferred by 19.7%, 13.9%, and 10.7% respectively. Present feedback provides us a broad direction in opting for the para-clinical phase where exposure to population-based research can be effectively placed on a systematic basis, without extra resources. ","1028":"To ascertain time taken for cataract surgery by ophthalmologists in the National Capital Region of Delhi and neighbouring districts, to determine what work output is feasible with the available ophthalmologists. The time-motion study was conducted during January to June 2006 in the National Capital Region of Delhi and neighbouring districts in North India. Data was collected by observing all activities from entry of a patient into the operating theatre to exit. A total of 156 cataract surgeries performed by 45 ophthalmologists in 38 hospitals were observed. A stop watch was used to record activity time, rounded off to the nearest 10 seconds. Case duration, surgical and clinical times were calculated. Ninety percent ophthalmologists completed surgery in 41.3 minutes. The 10th and 90th percentile for case duration time was 15.5 and 78.4 minutes respectively. Median surgical time was lowest for ophthalmologists working in the NGO sector (10 minutes), compared to the government (23.5 minutes), and private sector (17.3 minutes). Cataract surgical output can be increased in the country if operation theatre time is utilized optimally.

This paper assesses the current estimations of adverse health outcomes of climate change and explores methodological issues. The study is essentially based on literature review. The estimation of disease burden does not portray an accurate picture of the problem due to methodological constraints on account of de-linking several non-climatic factors. In particular, the developing nations face greater challenges due to poor infrastructure, and lack of institutions and health services. The concept of climate epidemiology can minimize the existing research gap by adapting trans-disciplinary approach and it can establish as a new frontier for health advocacy in the larger context of global environmental change.","1034":"","1035":"To study whether individual susceptibility plays a role in the occurrence of summer associated symptoms (dizziness, giddiness, fainting and weakness) among women 18-40 years of age and their effect on the quality of life. It was a prospective community based study carried out in an urban slum of Delhi as a follow up of an earlier study. All women who had \"given symptoms\" during summer in the earlier study and a sample of those who were asymptomatic were included in the current study. Both the groups were studied for the occurrence of \"given symptoms\" and quality of life during next summer and winter using a pre structured questionnaire and WHOQOL-BREF. Incidence of \"given symptoms\" during summer was more than three times among women who were symptomatic earlier compared to women who were asymptomatic. The incidence of these symptoms was significantly higher among the former across different age groups and BMI categories. Their physical domain of quality of life was also adversely affected. Continued high incidence of summer associated symptoms with adverse effect on their physical quality of life, among women who were symptomatic earlier too, points to individual susceptibility rather than random occurrence. This aspect requires for further studies. ","1036":"A community-based epidemiological study on birth weight of newborns was undertaken in the rural domain of a backward district of West Bengal. To find out the magnitude of low birth weight (&lt; 2.5 kg.) newborns and to highlight association, if any, of the socio-demographic, maternal and obstetric factors with birth weight of newborns. The study was undertaken in 30 sub-centre areas (cluster), selected by '30 clusters sampling technique', in the rural area of Puruliya district. An adequate sample of 512 newborns (466 plus 10% extra allowance) delivered in those selected clusters (17 consecutive deliveries in each cluster) were to be studied. But, due to inability to record birth weight within 48 hours (in home deliveries) and other reasons, 487 newborns were included in assessing magnitude of the LBW problem. In-depth information on several variables was obtained from 439 mothers of the newborns. Health Workers (F), Anganwadi Workers, Trained dais and Health Supervisors -(F), specially trained for the survey, collected information by using pre-designed and pre-tested proforma.

While detection of HIV\/AIDS cases remains a problem, ascertainment of AIDS deaths has emerged as a bigger challenge and concern. Despite a plethora of literature focusing on the methods to estimate AIDS deaths, none seems to be fulfilling the requirements for universal acceptance. In this paper, we give a systematic review of various methods used by experts to have a reliable estimate of the number of deaths due to AIDS. Initial assessments were derived from morgue based estimates in Africa which showed that AIDS was a leading cause of death. Its impact on demography was noticed in some of the studies conducted wherein age and sex specific mortality rates, standardized mortality ratios, potential years of life lost and decrease in life expectancy were calculated. \"Excess mortality factor\" as observed in 1980s and 1990s also indicated the approximate number of AIDS deaths. Besides, orphan hood method and verbal autopsy technique too, emerged as reliable means to identify mortality due to AIDS. Some indirect methods like estimation of deaths due to opportunistic infections like tuberculosis could also be a good indicator. The paper reviews the merits and possible biases encountered with each of the methods.","1049":"To study the catch up growth among low birth weight infants in relation to the normal birth weight counterparts in first six months of age.

The present study examined the media coverage of a judicial hanging and its immediate social effect. In a qualitative study the media coverage of a case of a judicial hanging was thoroughly discussed and the media influence, for over a period of ten weeks of the incident, in terms of suicide and copying of hanging among children, was collected and analysed. Eighteen cases were reported as an aftermath of this hanging: 1 suicide and 17 imitative hanging in children with 5 deaths. This report calls for attention that media should be cautious and responsible in presenting the news items that have potential social impact.","1082":"Cervical cancer is the commonest cancer among Indian women. The predominant risk factor is persistent infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) which is now well established. Despite being the commonest cancer, and the fact that it is a type of cancer, which can be detected early by sensitive screening methods there is no effective screening programme or preventive strategy for reducing its burden. This article reviewed the published studies that has been carried out in India during 1965-2005 on cervical cancer with emphasis on screening by Pap smear and other alternative methods. Conventionally, Pap smear cytology is the only method for screening; but recently various studies have been carried out to explore alternative methods like visual inspection methods. Due to the operational difficulties by Pap smear, these alternative screening methods could be more feasible for organized population based screening in a low resource country. There is therefore a need for initiating screening programmes within the existing health system in India.","1083":"To assess the status of iodine deficiency in the population of Orissa and track progress of the elimination efforts. A community based field survey was conducted. Data was collected using quantitative and qualitative research methods. Standard internationally recommended protocol and methodology was followed. Thirty clusters were selected using population proportionate to size sampling technique. School children aged 6 to 12 years were selected as target group. Goiter prevalence, urinary iodine excretion in the target group and iodine content of the salt at household were used as outcome variables. A total of 1200 children were studied. The total goiter rate was found to be 8.0%, of which 7.6% were grade I and 0.4% was grade-II goiter. The median urinary iodine excretion was found to be 85.4 microg\/L and 32.2% of the subjects had urinary iodine levels less than 50 microg\/L. Estimation of iodine content by titration method revealed that in only 45% of households salt was found to be adequately iodised. (Salt with iodine level 15 ppm). Iodine deficiency continues to be a public health problem in Orissa and the need to accelerate efforts to iodine sufficiency cannot be overemphasized. ","1084":"To study association between the geographic location (latitude) of studies evaluating protective effect of BCG vaccine and it's efficacy \/ effectiveness against tuberculosis. A comprehensive literature search was carried out to identify relevant studies. Data extraction from these studies included place of study (geographic latitude), study design and reported point estimate of protective effect of BCG vaccine against tuberculosis. Information on latitude was obtained from Oxford School Atlas for World Geography. A spearman rank correlation coefficient was estimated to study the association between the latitude of studies and protective effect of BCG vaccine. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was significant for all studies grouped together &amp; trials and marginally non-significant for other observational studies. However it was not statistically significant for case-control studies and cohort studies. Overall rho (for 80 studies) between latitude and protective effect of BCG was calculated to be 0.3853 (p = 0.0004). The results thus demonstrated that, in general BCG appeared to provide greater protection at higher latitudes. Thus a correlation coefficient of 0.3853 between latitude and protective effect would indicate that (0.3853)(2) or 15% of the variance in protective effect was accounted for by latitude. The study recognized an association between geographic locations of studies and reported protective effects of BCG vaccine against tuberculosis.

Participants of the study included 500 cases of induced abortion and the equal number of normal delivered women during the same period and in the same area as comparison group. Having two children, domestic problems and unwanted pregnancy were conditions acceptable to study subjects to terminate the pregnancy. Family and domestic problems, poor socio-economic status, short inter-pregnancy interval and completed family size were some of the important reasons quoted by study subjects for not desiring to continue the current pregnancy. Majority of the subjects felt that the decision to terminate or keep pregnancy is usually taken jointly by both the husband and wife. Family and domestic problems, poor socioeconomic status and short inter pregnancy interval were the important reasons quoted by abortion cases for seeking abortion in the current pregnancy. Only 1.80% of the cases reported failure of contraceptive method as a cause of seeking abortion services. In 78.4% of abortion cases as compared to 5.4% subjects from the comparison group, pregnancy was un-planned.","1091":"A cross-sectional study conducted among 400 'consumers' at G.M.C.

The study covered 35 districts spreading over 19 States of India. In this article, results for the State of West Bengal are being presented. Selected districts in West Bengal were Midnapore and Darjeeling where about 2400 sick persons from 2000 households were studied. About 20% sick persons actually availed ISM&amp;H treatment in the State. Majority availed Homeopathy followed by Ayurvedic medicines. Use of Unani and Siddha is negligible in this State. In case of minor ailments, ISM&amp;H was preferred by about 15% in Darjeeling district and 42% in Midnapore district. In case of serious illnesses, about 12% in Darjeeling district preferred ISM&amp;H, but very few (about 5%) preferred this in Midnapore. 39.4% and 20.8% of sick persons sought treatment from traditional healers in Midnapore and Darjeeling district respectively. Jaundice, snakebite, dog bite and 'bone setting' were some of the conditions for which traditional healers were mostly visited.

","1101":"A significant part of nosocomial infections are caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Nosocomial MRSA are known to be multidrug resistant and thus difficult to treat. A 2 year study was conducted between January 2001 and December 2002 at Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, Hubli to assess the prevalence of MRSA and its antibiotic susceptibility pattern in various wards. S. aureus was isolated from 714 patients, 283 (37.53%) of which exhibited methicillin resistance. Although these MRSA were multidrug resistant in all the wards, the problem was more severe in NICU and orthopedic wards. The results highlight the need for effective implementation of infection control measures in the hospital. There is a need for the judicious use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital and outside as their indiscriminate use can exert pressure in selecting out MRSA and other multidrug resistant organisms.

However, the average monthly number of direct walk-in persons and follow up, attending the centre at district hospital were higher than that of teaching hospital. Thus optimal use of information, education and communication (IEC) techniques needs to be strengthened to improve the utilization of ICTC services at the tertiary care teaching hospital.","1104":"To assess HIV serostatus, knowledge, behaviour and practices regarding HIV\/AIDS among blood donors, pregnant women and the general population in Ludhiana and to find out any association between these factors. The descriptive cross sectional study was conducted among blood donors attending the blood bank, pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics of the peripheral health centres of the department of Community Medicine, Christian Medical College Ludhiana, and the general population of the field practice areas of the Department, aged 15 years or more and willing to join the investigation. The study subjects were interviewed through a self-administered questionnaire and screened for HIV using ELISA technique. Seropositivity rates in the population groups and possible risk factors were compared, using EpiInfo 6.04d software. Prevalence of HIV infection was found to be 0.30 % (95 % CI 0.10 - 0.70) in the general population studied, 0.12 % (95 % CI 0.05 - 0.28) in the blood donors, and nil in the pregnant women. The respondents were deficient in knowledge about the modes of spread of HIV\/AIDS. No significant association was established between HIV sero-positivity and gender, age group, education, occupation, HbsAg status, or knowledge about the modes of spread of HIV\/AIDS. Sexually active unmarried young people 15-24 years old, those indulging in extra-marital sex, and those addicted to opium\/poppy-husk were observed to be at higher risk of HIV infection. The studied population groups have very low HIV seroprevalence. Misconceptions and lack of knowledge need to be corrected through education and awareness to avoid high-risk behaviour and prevent HIV infection. ","1105":"National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) identified five regional institutes (RIs) to monitor and supervise the 2006 round of annual HIV sentinel surveillance. The task mandated was quality control of both epidemiological data collection and HIV testing. The team at RI consisted of epidemiologist and microbiologist. We describe here the process of quality control and the quality of surveillance in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkand, and Delhi. The supervisors visited almost 90% of the sentinel sites. Performance of vast majority of the sentinel sites (92%) was satisfactory. The testing laboratories were found to be adhering to standard operating procedures. Concordance rate of test results between testing laboratory and the designated reference laboratory was high. Overall, the quality of sentinel surveillance was good. The lacunae found during the visit have been enumerated along with the recommendations for future surveillance round.","1106":"HIV surveillance has been held in the country since 1986,but the procedure has been standardized and adopted uniformly across the country since 1998 and is known as Annual Sentinel Surveillance for HIV infection. The method conforming to method laid down by WHO\/UNAIDS follows the Unlinked Anonymous Strategy for blood collection from attendees of STD, ANC clinics or female sex workers (FSW), men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IVDU) coming to drop in centres. The sites have been increasing over the years and at 703 in 2005, still lack coverage and adequate representation from all segments of the population and rural areas. The challenges are being addressed in the next round.","1107":"Surveillance of HIV epidemic serves the important purposes of situation analysis for programme design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. For HIV surveillance among general population, HIV prevalence data from pregnant women attending sentinel sero-surveillance sites, and prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT) services as well as data from population based surveys are used. Data on HIV prevalence among voluntary donors can be yet another source of information on the prevalence and progress of HIV infection. HIV prevalence data from 10 PPTCT centers, 58 Government blood banks and 9-13 sentinel sero-surveillance sites during 2004-2006 in West Bengal were analyzed. During this period, estimated HIV prevalence ranged between 0.40% to 0.86% among the ANC attendees of sentinel sero-surveillance sites, between 0.15-0.18% at PPTCT centers, and between 0.29-0.49% among voluntary blood donors. Data on HIV prevalence among voluntary blood donors can provide a fairly good understanding of trends and patterns of HIV prevalence among the general population specially among young males. For making meaningful inferences from such analysis, standardization in terms of blood collection, testing for HIV infection, reporting and analysis is called for. This is a very cost-effective method of estimating HIV prevalence, and is amenable to detailed analysis of spatial and temporal trends of HIV infection in the general population. ","1108":"This article attempts to appraise the methodology of estimating the people living with AIDS in India. In this estimation, the primary demographic data were obtained from Registrar General of India and Sample Registration System. HIV prevalence data was drawn from HIV Sentinel Surveillance conducted at 704 sites in 2005. The HIV prevalence at each site was estimated using the formula p +\/- 1.645O(pq\/n), where p represents the proportion of HIV positives and n the number of attendees at the site. Statewise prevalence for each risk group was estimated with the help of the formula giving 90% confidence internal for median prevalence as Median of the proportion positive +\/- 1.645 x 1.2533O(pq\/n), where 1.2533 was the adjustment for large variations involved. If the estimated median prevalence comes out to be zero, it was replaced by the actual prevalence of the low prevalent states for each risk group. In case of general population, the urban-rural ratio came out to be 1:1 in case of high prevalence states and 2.4:1 in case of other states. Having adjusted for age, the sex differential was 1.2:1 in gereralised epidemic states, 2:1 in concentrated epidemic states and 3:1 in low epidemic states. Overall additions were made for FSW by applying to them the HIV prevalence observed in FSWsites under TI. Prevalence in child population was done by applying the GFR to the women with HIV and then multiplying it by 0.3 (percentage infected).","1109":"","1110":"","1111":"The present study was undertaken to determine the seroprevalence of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in patients attending medical clinics or admitted in ICU with febrile signs and symptoms of heamorrhages. 168 (39.4%) out of 426 samples were tested positive for IgM antibodies.

The present study was designed as hospital-based pair-matched case-control study and was carried out at Government Medical College Hospital, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. It included 877 cases of tuberculosis and 292 cases of leprosy (diagnosed by WHO criteria), born onwards 1962. Each case was pair-matched with one control for age, sex and socio-economic status. BCG vaccination status was assessed by examination for the presence of BCG scar, immunisation records if available and information from subjects\/parents of children. Subjects uncertain about BCG vaccination were not included. The diameter of the BCG scar was measured both across and along the arm in millimeters using a plastic ruler. The average was then calculated. A significant protective association between BCG vaccination and tuberculosis (OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.31-0.47) and leprosy (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.26-0.55) was observed. The overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 62% (95% CI 53-69) against tuberculosis and 62% (95% CI 45- against leprosy. Vaccine effectiveness against tuberculosis and leprosy was non-significantly greater in the group who had BCG scar size &lt; or =5 mm as compared to subjects who had BCG scar size &gt; 5 mm. Thus there was no clear association between BCG scar size and its effectiveness. The current study did not identify any significant association between BCG scar size and its effectiveness against tuberculosis or leprosy.

Many references revealed that tobacco dust exposure induces mutations, damage to DNA etc. which are supposed to be the consequences of free radical generation. In present study attempt have been made to evaluate the status of oxidants and antioxidants and their relation with nicotine. 90 bidi workers were screened for serum lipid peroxide (MDA) and serum nitric oxide (NO*) as oxidant and erythrocytic-Superoxide Dismutase (RBC-SOD), Vitamin-C as antioxidant. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and urinary cotinine were also measured. These bidi workers were further divided in 3 groups, Group 1, 11 and III exposed to tobacco dust for about 10 to 14 yrs, 15 to 19 yrs and 20 to 24 yrs of exposure respectively. Highly significant excretion of Urinary cotinine was found in all groups of bidi workers as compared with control (p &lt; 0.001). The levels of MDA, and NO* were found to be significantly elevated in all the three groups with progression of exposure, than the control (p &lt; 0.001), where as the levels of RBC-SOD, Vitamin-C and TAC were significantly decreased in all the three groups as compared with controls (p &lt; 0.001).

The mean birth weight showed a gradual increase in these years. There was a gain of 88.9 g in 2000 since 1986 in term deliveries. There were significant differences in the mean birth weights among the four years, even after stratifying for gestation. However, there was no significant decrease in the percentage of low birth weight babies in these years. Low birth weight showed significant association with parity, age of the mother, booking status, haemoglobin level, and literacy of the mother. Since there was no significant decrease in low birth weight babies in spite of increasing birth weight, there is a need for continued and committed effort to realize the goals of RCH.","1131":"In developing countries, children of 0-5 years of age form a large as well as \"high risk\" group. Malnutrition poses a grave risk to the health of these children. The main objectives of this study were to assess the health &amp; nutritional status of children of 0-5 years of age group &amp; to study the influence of various epidemiological factors on health &amp; nutritional status of children on 0-5 years of age group. It is a community based cross sectional study done in randomly selected three wards of Petlad town, district Anand in Gujarat state. 300 children of age group 0-5 years selected by systematic sampling method. Mother of each child included in the study was subjected to personal interview in her own house followed by clinical examination &amp; anthropometric measurements of the child. The three indices of nutritional status namely, weight for age, height for age, &amp; weight for height were expressed in standard deviation units from the median for the international reference populations as per WHONCHS standards &amp; were compared with WHONCHS growth reference data. The prevalence of under weight (wt. for age below 2SD) was 43.67%. 50.3% children were found stunted (ht. 1br age below -2 SID) with higher prevalence in 2nd and 5th year of life. Prevalence of wasting (wt. for ht. below 2SD) was comparatively low (23.2% with a peak in 3rd year of life). These nutritional parameters showed a significant association with parental education, socio-economic status, family size, environmental conditions (safe drink water, sanitary waste disposal &amp; overcrowding), &amp; episodes of common diseases.","1132":"","1133":"","1134":"The prevalence of RTIs in 600 married females (15-44 yrs.) representing 12 subcentre villages of Daurala block of Meerut was 35.3%.

Smoking had a significant (p&lt; or =0.01) correlation with serum LDL-C, triglycerides and systolic blood pressure. 84% had sedentary life style. 36% and 7% of the subjects were overweight and obese. The body mass index was positively and significantly (p&lt; or =0.01) correlated with serum triglycerides. 32% and 20% of the subjects had systolic and diastolic blood pressure above normal. 22% were diagnosed for hyperglycemia. 6% suffered from hypercholesterolemia and 28% had borderline high values of serum cholesterol. 22% and 6% had high triglyceride and LDL-C levels, respectively. The study concluded that the etiology of CVD is multifactorial and no single factor is an absolute cause among the rural Punjabi male patients. Therefore, desirable modification in diet and life style can significantly reduce the risk of CVD among rural males of Punjab.","1155":"A prospective descriptive interview based hospital study was carried on 47 women admitted with septic abortion to evaluate their psychosocial, demographic and clinical profile These women were predominantly parous (75%), hindus (60%), between 20-30 years of age (60%) and mostly married (91.4%) house wives (63.8%). More than 90% already had one or more male child. The contraceptive use was dismally low (23.4%). Their knowledge about legalisation, place and persons authorized to conduct abortions was very less, however large majority (87%) underwent abortions within 3 months of pregnancy. Large family, poverty and spacing were the main reasons cited for abortions. Abdominal pain, fever, genital bleeding, diarhoea and abdominal distension were presenting clinical features in order of frequency. Advanced sepsis and associated medical and surgical complications were present in more than half the patients and 6% succumbed to these problems. The current experience was an eye opener for most of them and changed their future attitude. Hence education, economic prosperity, easy access to reproductive health facilities and institutional management of sepsis is the key to make abortions safe.","1156":"A verbal autopsy (VA) questionnaire, which had an open-ended description of the deceased's illness followed by a series of close-ended questions on specific symptoms and signs, was used by three trained field workers to interview relatives of the deceased who had died in a Chandigarh hospital in previous year. The sensitivity and specificity of the cause of death assigned by physician from the verbal autopsy was calculated against the cause of death derived from the hospital records. Of the 262 verbal autopsies, 60% were males and 23% belonged to rural area. Specificity of VA cause of death was high (&gt;95%) for all broad cause groups except cardiovascular (79%) diseases. Sensitivity was highest for injuries (85%) and it was in the range of 60% to 65% for circulatory diseases, neoplasms, and infectious diseases. Sensitivity was low (20% to 40%) for respiratory, digestive and endocrine diseases. Cause specific proportionate mortality for major cause groups by the VA were statistically similar to the causes of deaths derived from the hospital records (p&gt;0.05). Therefore, VA can be used for determining causes of adult deaths.","1157":"India ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) on February 27, 2005. The WHO FCTC is the world's first public health treaty that aims to promote and protect public health and reduce the devastating health and economic impacts of tobacco. Post ratification, each member state as part of general obligation has agreed to develop, implement, periodically update and review comprehensive multisectoral national tobacco control strategies, plans and programmes in accordance with this Convention and the protocols to which it is a Party. The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) was developed to track tobacco use among young people across countries and the GYTS surveillance system intends to enhance the capacity of countries to design, implement, and evaluate tobacco control and prevention programs. The South-East Asia Region of WHO has developed the \"Regional Strategy for Utilization of the GYTS\" to meet this need for countries in the Region. In 2003, India has passed its national tobacco control legislation (India Tobacco Control Act [ITCA]), which includes provisions designed to reduce tobacco consumption and protect citizens from exposure to second hand smoke. Data in the GYTS (India) report can be used as a baseline measure for future evaluation of the tobacco control programs implemented by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. India has to upscale some provisions of its National Law to accommodate all of the requirements of FCTC. Using determinants measured by GYTS in India, the government can monitor the impact of enforcing various provisions of the ITCA and the progress made in achieving the goals of the WHO FCTC and the Regional Strategies. Effective enforcement of the provisions of ITCA will show in the receding numbers of tobacco use prevalence figures and reduction in the expenditures associated with tobacco use in India.","1158":"","1159":"","1160":"Campylobacteriosis is a leading cause of zoonotic diarrhoea in the developed as well as developing countries.

The available information on maternal mortality in rural India is inadequate and scanty. This study presented maternal mortality data from the demographically and developmentally (including for health) poor performing state of Uttar Pradesh. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted utilizing a stratified cluster sampling design between 1989-90 in eight districts of Uttar Pradesh. Four good performing districts namely, Agra, Farrukhabad, Ghaziabad and Badaun from the western region and four poor performing districts from the eastern region namely, Gorakhpur, Basti, Varanasi and Pratapgarh were chosen. A door-to-door household interview survey was carried out in the selected villages covering a population of 11.67 lakhs in 889 villages. Maternal mortality rates during 1989 ranged between 533745 per 100,000 live births except in Ghaziabad district where the rate was as low as 101 per 100,000 live births. The rate in Eastern U.P. was higher (573 per 100,000 live births) as compared to that in Western U.P. (472 per 100,000 live births). A total of 286 maternal deaths were reported during the study period. The direct obstetric causes accounted for 55.7% of maternal deaths with haemorrhage (26.4%) being the most prevalent. Anaemia and jaundice (17.4%) were the most prevalent indirect causes of maternal deaths. Most of the maternal deaths could have been prevented if timely medical care was available.","1163":"Five blocks of Nasik district in Maharashtra were surveyed in 1999-2000 for distribution and academic degrees of doctors of all kinds. The five blocks have 84 % villages without any health care provider (read doctor) no matter qualified or quack. All the 555 doctors including Govt. doctors are concentrated in 16 % of villages, mainly in small townships and market centers. Physical access to any doctor is thus tedious. Often it requires travelling and hidden costs like loss of wages for the accompanying person. It also involves a hidden cost of deferred treatment.

Hence the present study was carried out to analyze the trend of SSPE over the past ten years in and around Chandigarh. A total of 205 patients with clinical features suggestive of SSPE were enrolled for the study during Jan'92 to Dec. 2001. Measles specific antibodies were detected in blood and CSF by HAI method. 114 patients were found to be positive for measles specific HAI antibody with a male preponderance. The number of SSPE cases were found to be more during the period 1992-95 in comparison to the next 6 years (p &lt; 0.05). The high incidence of SSPE in our country could be due to improper vaccine coverage, poor cold chain maintenance or circulation of atypical measles virus strain.","1182":"The recent biotechnological revolution in Molecular Entomology explores new promising tools for the control of vector borne diseases through genetic manipulation of vectorial competence. The gene transfer technology is hoped to make the malaria vectors incapable of supporting the development of malaria parasite which will ultimately lead to eradication of the parasites and the disease.","1183":"A series of Community Psychiatric Clinics were conducted in different blocks of Sundarban region of West Bengal. One of the primary objectives of this was to collect clinical epidemiological data on psychiatric morbidity in the region. A total of 26 clinics were conducted in Sagar, Kakdwip, Canning and Gosaba block of the Sundarban region during the period from end 1998 to end 2000. A total of 451 psychiatric cases with diagnostic categories (male 239, female 212) and 215 non-psychiatric cases (male 107 and female 108) were seen in these clinics. Diagnostic Interview Schedules (SCID) and Clinical rating scales like Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scales were used to ascertain clinical diagnosis quantitatively. Special emphasis was given on common psychiatric disorders.","1184":"The study was conducted at Birbhum and Purba Medinipur districts of West Bengal to assess the routine primary immunization coverage following 40 cluster sampling technique was used to study 320 children in each of the districts. BCG coverage was found to be 79.69% at Birbhum and 84.38% at Purba Medinipur. Only 62.81% children at Birbhum and 67.81% children at Purba Medinipur received all the three primary doses of DPT. Regarding OPV, coverage with three primary doses were only 65% and 66.88% at Birbhum and Purba Medinipur respectively. Measles vaccine coverage was very poor at both the districts, 55.94% at Birbhum and 62.5% at Purba Medinipur. Full primary immunization was observed 53.13% and 61.56% in Birbhum and Purba Medinipur respectively. High drop-out rate was identified as a major deficiency in both the districts. Of the children who received at least one routine vaccine, more than 1\/3rd at Birbhum and more than 1\/4 th at Purba Medinipur did not turn up later for completion of their primary vaccine doses. It is evident that routine immunization coverage was poor in both the districts and it seems there has been no improvement in situation for last few years. It will influence not only the child morbidity and mortality situation but also will jeopardize the paralytic polio eradication programme. Urgent intervention should be undertaken to address the large number of non-immunized children as well as high proportion of drop-outs.","1185":"The present pair-matched case control study was carried out at Government Medical College Hospital, Nagpur, India, a tertiary care hospital with the objective to devise and validate a risk scoring system for prediction of hemorrhagic stroke. The study consisted of 166 hospitalized CT scan proved cases of hemorrhagic stroke (ICD 9, 431-432), and a age and sex matched control per case. The controls were selected from patients who attended the study hospital for conditions other than stroke. On conditional multiple logistic regression five risk factors- hypertension (OR = 1.9. 95% Cl = 1.5-2.5). raised scrum total cholesterol (OR = 2.3, 95% Cl = 1.1-4.9). use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents (OR = 3.4, 95% Cl =1.1-10.4). past history of transient ischaemic attack (OR = 8.4, 95% Cl = 2.1- 33.6) and alcohol intake (OR = 2.1, 95% Cl = 1.3-3.6) were significant. These factors were ascribed statistical weights (based on regression coefficients) of 6, 8, 12, 21 and 8 respectively. The nonsignificant factors (diabetes mellitus, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, type A personality, history of claudication, family history of stroke, history of cardiac diseases and oral contraceptive use in females) were not included in the development of scoring system. ROC curve suggested a total score of 21 to be the best cut-off for predicting haemorrhag stroke. At this cut-off the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictivity and Cohen's kappa were 0.74, 0.74, 0.74 and 0.48 respectively. The overall predictive accuracy of this additive risk scoring system (area under ROC curve by Wilcoxon statistic) was 0.79 (95% Cl = 0.73-0.84). Thus to conclude, if substantiated by further validation, this scorincy system can be used to predict haemorrhagic stroke, thereby helping to devise effective risk factor intervention strategy.","1186":"Malnutrition is an important Public Health problem globally as well as in India. Mortality is a multi-causal phenomenon in which malnutrition is but one factor directly or indirectly contributing 55% mortality of children under-five years of age. Authors observed higher prevalence of severe degree of Malnutrition in the underserved section of population with specific reference to girl child, under 3 years of age, where there were large number of children in the family, repeated infections and Measles. Growth monitoring Services in the ICDS scheme meant only weight recording and was not at all satisfactory. Even the majority of the Anganwadi workers (AWW) stated that it meant monthly weight recording of children while only few knew it is in addition plotting these on growth charts and advising mothers if growth was not proper. Around 60% of caregivers did not know about growth monitoring. The concept of growth monitoring should be changed to Growth surveillance to emphasize more on the action components of it.","1187":"There are 11.1 million children in the age group 0-6 years in West Bengal. Of these, every second child under 3 years of age is underweight, more than four out of ten are stunted, and one out of eight are wasted. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme in West Bengal has 355 operational projects covering 53,064 operational anganwadi centers reaching out to more than four million beneficiaries--approximately half of whom are children in the age group 0-3 years. The Department of Women and Child Development (DWCD) is trying to identify and replicate innovative, community-based, sustainable approaches. One such innovative initiative has been the \"Keno Parbo Na\" project based on the Positive Deviance (PD) approach which aims to reduce and prevent malnutrition among children under 3 years of age by focusing on local solutions and resources, local behaviors and practices. Behavior change is emphasized through participatory learning and community mobilization. The pilot phase of the project has been completed in two districts [Four blocks (2 in each District) and 32 villages\/AWCs (8 in each block)] of West Bengal (Murshidabad and South 24 Parganas). The analysis of the project activities so far reveals that the issue of malnutrition and its prevention is now visible in the villages covered. Acceptance of desirable behavioral practices is observed within the community. A steady reduction in the moderate and severe level of malnutrition was noted across four districts. A general preponderance of girl children was noted at the entry stage indicating higher levels of severe and moderate malnutrition among girl children to begin with but also suggesting PD as an important strategy in reducing the gender gap in malnutrition. The boys gain in terms of nutritional status faster than the girls so in the intermediate phase malnourished girls are more in number. However, by the sixth \/ ninth round, as the malnutrition levels decline substantially, the gender gap tends to close.","1188":"Rajasthan is the largest state in the country frequently affected by droughts. The year 2002 happened to be the fifth consecutive year of drought. Almost all districts of the State were hit by it. The district of Baran located in South-East of Rajasthan has 'Sahariya' tribal population concentrated in its Kishanganj and Shahabad blocks. Press reports of starvation deaths amongst tribal children in these blocks created a stir in the local district and the State Government set ups. The paper describes an objective and professional approach to deal with the situation. Rapid nutritional assessment indicated very high prevalence of severe under weight (28.3%) and wasting (4.7%) amongst under five children. Nutrition Care Centres (NCC) were set up in selected villages to provide targeted feeding and care to these children as per WHO guidelines. Local 'Sahariya' community was involved to run these NCC. Intensive public education campaign was carried out to promote improved child caring practices and referral of malnourished children with complication to hospitals. Orientation of press and electronic media on factual details regarding the situation helped create an enabling environment to implement remedial measures. The impact of 'Nutrition Care Centres' assessed after six months was found to be positive in terms of reduction in prevalence of under nutrition in children from 66.7% to 59.6%. Successful management of severe malnutrition amongst children by workers at Nutrition Care Centes and in family settings using standard protocols led to the wide scale replication of the approach by Anganwadi centres in different district of Rajasthan. The State Government also created an additional cadre of worker called 'Sahayogini' to support Anganwadi worker and promote better child caring practices at family level.","1189":"","1190":"","1191":"Indian Public Health Association (IPHA) welcomes the release of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) documents. It suggests that manpower requirements of the Community Health Centre (CHC) should be rationally determined on the basis of work and patient load of the CHC. Importance should be given on availability of simple &amp; life saving equipment, female staff when male staff is not available. Safe drinking water, an adequate sanitation and excreta disposal facility through Panchayet Raj Institution (PRI) or privatization was proposed. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) has been accepted more streamlining based on the community was suggested. Capacity building or training should be CHC based for grass-root level functionaries with incentive to Medical officer (MO). IPHA proposes to extend support in capacity building, development of manual for ASHA &amp; other categories of health professional as well as Program Implementation Plan (PIP).","1192":"National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) launched by Government of India holds great hopes and promises to serve the deprived and underserved communities of rural areas. The backbone of the programme is Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA), which will play major role in the implementation of the programme. The invariable existence of socio-cultural clusters in the community has always been a major challenge to the health care efforts made by the government. Though ASHA is a novel concept to melt the ice in the culture of silence among the various cluster community groups, it is important to emphasize that inter-cluster communication may still pose a problem, which ASHA may be unable to address. Considering the constraints of ASHA and success of cluster community approach in Unicef supported community based Maternal Child Health &amp; Nutrition (MCHN) Project, it is quite reasonable to state that inclusion of community mobilisers (Bal Parivar Mitra) from within the cluster community group might well be an asset to the programme, who may actually bring about the task of spreading the spirit of NRHM. These set of functionaries may work in coordination to bring about the desired behaviour changes and decrease the social delays responsible for maternal and childhood mortality. It will also bring about the feeling of community participation and ownership. The programme is in its initial phase but has years ahead of it to bring visible changes at community level to make it a reality.","1193":"Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) continues to remain high in our country without showing any declining trend over a period of two decades. The proportions of maternal deaths contributed by direct obstetric causes have also remained more or less the same in rural areas. There is a strong need to improve coverage of antenatal care, promote institutional deliveries and provide emergency obstetric care. Delays occur in seeking care for obstetric complications and levels of 'met obstetric need' continue to be low in many parts of the country. Most of the First Referral Units (FRUs) and CHCs function at sub-optimal level in the country. National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) offers institutional mechanism and strategic options to reduce high MMR. 'Janani Suraksha Yojna', strengthening of CHCs (as per Indian Public Health standards) to offer 24 hours quality services including that of anesthetists and Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) are important proposals in this regard. District Health Mission can play an important role in monitoring maternal deaths occurring in hospitals or in community and thus create a social momentum to prevent and reduce maternal deaths. NRHM, however, depends largely on Panchayati Raj Institutions for effective implementation of proposed interventions and utilization of resources. In most parts of our country, State Governments have not empowered PRIs with real devolution of power. Therefore, much needs to be done locally to build the capacity of PRIs and develop state-specific guidelines in operational terms to implement interventions under NRHM for reducing maternal mortality ratio.","1194":"The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), launched by the present government as part of its honouring the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) commitment, had its content shaped by an active process of dialogue between many stakeholders. This article traces the contours of the discussions on three key concerns of civil society that influenced their contributions to the shaping of the National Rural Health Mission agenda. These three concerns were promotion of targeted sterilisation, a retreat of the state from its commitments to the health sector and that the NRHM agenda would lead to privatisation of public health facilities. Whereas fears on targeted sterilisation and retreat of the state may be unrealistic, there is a thrust to increased involvement of the private sector, which needs to be understood in its entirety. There is need for continued engagement byequity concerned public health professionals and health activists at all levels of implementation and not merely community monitoring to influence and shape the National Rural Health Mission in a pro-poor direction.","1195":"National Rural Health Mission is strategic framework to implement the National Health Policy 2002. The scheme of Accredited Social Health Activist is an improvement over the earlier Community Health Guide Scheme. Integration of various health and family welfare programmes will result in economy and allocation of resources as per needs of the districts. Decentralised planning with the involvement of Panchayati Raj Institutions is likely to make health as people's programme. Converging water supply, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition with health planning is a logical step. The proposal to strenthen institutions of primary health care and Community Health Centres as functional Rural Hospitals alongwith introduction of Indian Public Health Standards and accountability of public health institutions to the public is likely to revolutionise the status of health care in rural India.","1196":"National Rural Health Mission represents an important public health initiative to address essential health needs of the country's underserved population. For the Mission to achieve its goals, urban population needs to be included in its scope. Urban poor population constitutes nearly a third of India's urban population and is growing at three times the national population growth rate. Health status and access of reproductive and child health services of slum dwellers are poor and comparable to the rural population. Efforts to improve the conditions of urban poor necessitate strengthening national policy and fiscal mandate, augmenting and strengthening the urban health delivery system, coordinating among multiple stakeholders, involving private sector, strengthening municipal functioning and building community capacities. National Rural Health Mission should be broadened to National Public Health Mission. This paper discusses issues pertaining to health conditions of the urban poor, present status of services, challenges and suggests options for NRHM to bridge the large gap.","1197":"This paper explores the forces that led to the conceptualisation of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) including the role of the Common Minimum Programme and the Structural Adjustment Programme. The paper analyses the key components of the NRHM in terms of the theoretical frameworks of decentralisation, integration of programmes, primary health care, community health workers and standards.","1198":"Training plays a key role in health manpower development and management of health care system. Since NRHM is a new concept, due weight-age has to be given to various components of the Mission. For the efficient and effective performance of medical and paramedical workers a certain level of competence in the form of knowledge, skill and attitude are essential. Various aspects of training activities to be included in training programmes have been discussed in the paper.","1199":"The recently declared National Rural Health Mission has aroused significant interest, being both welcomed and closely scrutinized, since there is a long overdue and outstanding need to strengthen weak and dysfunctional public health systems in rural India. In this setting, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA) has been involved in analysing various aspects of the Mission. The concern has been that it should develop in a manner that actually strengthens public health systems in an integrated manner, and that it should empower communities to be involved in the planning and utilization of these systems in a Rights-based framework. In this article, one will draw upon and reflect on a few of the major concerns about NRHM that have emerged during the insightful discussions in JSA.","1200":"The health care system in India has expanded considerably over the last few decades but the quality of the services is not up to the mark due to various reasons. Hence standards are being introduced in order to improve the quality of services. A task group under the chairmanship of Director General of Health Services, Government of India was constituted to recommend the standards to be called as Indian Public Health Standards. IPHS are a set of standards envisaged to improve the quality of health care delivery in the country under the National Rural Health Mission.","1201":"The setting up of the National Rural Health Mission is yet another political move by the present government of India to make yet another promise to the long suffering rural population to improve their health status. As has happened so often in the past, it is based on questionable premises. It adopts a simplistic approach to a highly complex problem. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and its advisors, either because of ignorance or otherwise, have doggedly refused to learn from the many experiences of the past, both in terms of the efforts to earlier somewhat sincere efforts to develop endogenous mechanisms to offer access to health services as well as from the devastative impact on the painstakingly built rural health services of the imposition of prefabricated, ill-conceived, ill-formulated, techno-centric vertical programmes on the people of India. The also ignore some of the basic postulates of public health practice in a country like India. That did not substantiate the bases of some of their substantive contentions with scientific data obtained from health systems research reveals that they are not serious about their promise to rural population.

Existing programme to control IDD needs to be continuously monitored through recommended methods and indicators. Thus we undertook the study to assess the prevalence of goiter, status of urinary iodine excretion (UIE) level and to estimate iodine content of salts at the household level in Dakshin Dinajpur district, West Bengal. We conducted a community-based, cross-sectional study in 2004; among 2250 school children, aged 8-10 years. The '30 cluster' sampling methodology and indicators for assessment of IDD, as recommended by the joint WHO\/UNICEF\/ICCIDD consultation, were used for the study. Goitre was assessed by standard palpation technique, UIE was analyzed by wet digestion method and salt samples were tested by spot iodine testing kit. Of the 2250 children, 419 (18.6%) had goitre (95% CI = 17.0 - 20.2%). Total goitre rate (TGR) was not significantly different in respect of gender, age and religion. Visible goitre rate was 2.5%. Median urinary iodine excretion level was 16 mcg\/dL (normal: &gt; or = 10 mcg\/dl.) and 16.5% children had value less than 5 mcg\/dL.

Current daily smoking, and smokeless tobacco use reported by 20.4%, and 5.8% school personnel respectively. Men reported significantly more for all kinds of daily tobacco use as compared to women. School tobacco control policy on three scales was reported poor (17.7-30%). However most of the school personnel felt need for such policies (82.7-93.6%). Teaching and training on tobacco was reported low (29.9%-50.4%). However most of the school personnel (79.1-93.6%) were supportive on different measures of tobacco control. Training of school personnel may provide students with essential tools to help them adopt and maintain a smoke free lifestyle.","1230":"Tobacco use prevalence, knowledge and attitude was assessed among school personnel in Orissa. A single cluster sample design with probability proportional to the enrolment in grades VIII-X was used. Statistical analysis was clone using SUDAAN and the C-sample procedure in Epi-Info. The school response rate was 100%. Over 72% of school personals participated in the survey, the proportion of men being 84%. Current cigarette smoking, bidi smoking and smokeless tobacco use was reported by 26.8%, 30.1% and 38.8% school personnel respectively. Current daily cigarette smoking, bidi smoking and smokeless tobacco use reported by 18.3%, 16.6% and 24.2% school personnel respectively. Men reported significantly more all kinds of daily tobacco use as compared to women. School tobacco control policy on three scales was reported poor (25-39%). However most of the school personnel felt need for such policies (88-98%). Teaching and training on tobacco was reported low (22.7%-35.9%). Most of the school personnel (87-95%) were supportive on different measures on tobacco control issues. Introduction of comprehensive school policies and enforcement on tobacco use may help to reduce adolescent and school personnel tobacco use.","1231":"The association between school tobacco policies and tobacco use prevalence among students were examined. A two stage cluster sample design with probability proportional to the enrolment in grades VIII-X was used. Comparison was made between schools with a tobacco policy (Federal schools) and schools without a policy (State schools). Stratified probability samples of 50 schools each were selected. SUDAAN and the C-sample procedure in Epi-Info was used for statistical analysis. Students from State schools (without tobacco policy) reported significantly higher ever and current any tobacco use, current smokeless tobacco use and current smoking compared to Federal schools (with tobacco policy) both in rural and urban areas. Classroom teaching on the harmful effects of tobacco was significantly higher (17-24 times) in Federal schools than State schools both in rural and urban areas. Parental tobacco use was similar for students in Federal and State schools. Students attending state schools were more likely than students attending Federal schools to have friends who smoke or chew tobacco. These findings suggest that the wider introduction of comprehensive school policies may help to reduce adolescent tobacco use.","1232":"Determination of the prevalence and attitudes toward tobacco use was assessed among 13-15 years school students in Bihar (India). Schools having grade 8-10 in Bihar. A two stage cluster sample design was used. SUDAAN and the C-sample procedure in Epi-Info was used for statistical analysis. Of the 2636 respondents, 71.8% (76.5% boys, 57.2% girls) were ever tobacco users; of them 48.9% had used tobacco before 10 years of age. Current use was reported by 58.9% (Boys 61.4%, Girls 51.2%); smokeless tobacco by 55.6% (Boys 57.6%, Girls 49.2%); and smoking by 19.4% (23.0% boys, 7.8% girls). Nearly one third (29%) students were exposed to ETS inside their homes and nearly half (48%) outside their homes. Almost all students reported watching cigarette and gutka advertisements in almost all kinds of media and events. Tobacco use by parents and friends, knowledge on harmful effects of chewing tobacco, smoking and environmental smoke, and attitudes on tobacco use by others were strongly associated with student tobacco use. Current tobacco use was reported significantly more by students who received pocket money\/or were earning than by students who did not receive any pocket money\/or did not earn (p value for trend &lt;0.0001). Over half of current users (56%) bought their tobacco products from stores; of these, over 3\/4th (77.2%) of them despite their age, had no difficulty in procuring these products. Teaching in schools regarding harmful effects of tobacco use was non-existent (3%). This urgently requires a comprehensive prevention program in schools and the community especially targeted towards girls.

It was observed that in the recent rounds of IPPI, more than 95% coverage was observed in all the surveyed districts excepting in 24 Parganas South where coverage was around 92%. Situation at the Goalpara district further needed attention, as the coverage during February 03 as well as in the past two rounds were 90.13%, 88.13%, and 91.04% respectively. In all these districts booths were the main sites for IPPI dose though 1\/3rd to 1\/4th of the beneficiaries received immunization at home also. It was also observed that around 10% of the beneficiaries were not administered any PPI dose in the either of the rounds, in 24 Parganas (south) &amp; Murshidabad districts, from where maximum number of Poliomyelitis cases were reported. At Goalpara it was 19%. Main reason for not being covered with PPI doses in either of the rounds in all the districts excepting Kolkata was \"Not aware of the need for additional doses\". In Kolkata \"child sick\" was the main reason. Health workers were main source of information of PPI in South 24 Parganas (67.13%), Malda (58.25%) &amp; West Midnapur (54%). At Murshidabad \"announcement through mike\" (61.25%) was the main source of information while in Kolkata, TV was the main source (67.13%). Miking (56.38%) was the main source of information for PPI at Goalpara district of Assam. It was observed that involvement of multiple methods &amp; media of communication was helpful in disseminating dates &amp; other information of PPI.","1237":"A coverage evaluation survey was carried out in the five districts of West Bengal and Goalpara district of Assam during the period from November 2002 to April 2003 through 40 clusters sampling technique. Results revealed that highest coverage with routine immunization was in Paschim Medinipur (82.5%) followed by Kolkata (71.6%), Malda (65.3%), 24 Parganas South (61.9%) districts of West Bengal. Murshidabad district of West Bengal had only 41.3% coverage while poorest coverage was observed in Goalpara district (27.2%) of Assam. \"Not aware of the need for routine immunization\" was the main reason for not being vaccinated with all the UIP vaccines. Vaccination was given mainly through government hospitals in Kolkata while it was administered mainly through subcentres in the other rural districts.","1238":"Neonatal Tetanus (NNT) elimination has been defined as an annual incidence of &lt;1 case of NNT per 1,000 live births in each district of a province, state, or country. Reported incidence of NNT does not always reflect the true dimension of the problem. Thus, NNT mortality survey was planned during November 2003 to validate NNT elimination in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Firstly, based on review of records and recommended standard algorithm, two highest risk districts, namely Kurnool and Mahbubnagar were identified. In the second stage, NNT mortality survey was conducted in these two districts using lot quality assurance-cluster sampling (LQA-CS) methodology. In each of the two districts, 62 neonatal deaths were detected with no deaths due to NN, indicating incidence of NNT below 1\/1000 LB. Thus, validation of NNT elimination may be concluded.","1239":"BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guerin) vaccine remains a highly controversial method of preventing tuberculosis and leprosy despite more than eighty years of use. The protective effect against tuberculosis observed in various studies ranged from -56% to 98%. Case-control studies carried out at Nagpur reported moderate effectiveness of BCG vaccination in prevention of tuberculosis. Its effectiveness was higher against extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. The summary protective effects obtained from meta-analysis of trials, cohort studies and case-control studies of BCG vaccination and tuberculosis were 51 (33-64), 76 (63-85), and 65 (57-72) percent respectively. The case-control studies carried out at Nagpur also demonstrated a significant protective association between BCG vaccination and leprosy. The summary protective effects obtained from meta-analysis of trials, cohort studies and case-control studies of BCG vaccination and leprosy were 43 (27-55), 62 (53-69), and 59 (46-68) percent respectively. The results of the current study and systematic review thus supported arguments favoring use of BCG vaccine for prevention of tuberculosis and leprosy.","1240":"Andhra Pradesh has built a model immunization program over the last few years. Main accomplishments include the state's adoption of hepatitis B for all its newborns and now, for the first time, the Indian government is offering universal coverage of all Indian infants with Hepatitis B vaccine. The AP government, working in partnership with PATH, an international, nonprofit organization based out of Seattle, Washington, USA, has made a series of improvements to the health system. The partnership fostered widespread adoption of safe injection practices and technologies, and improved immunization systems through responsive, supportive management. Japanese encephalitis (JE) control was greatly enhanced through the AP government partnership with PATH, resulting in a 90 percent reduction in cases of JE within the first year of joint efforts.","1241":"Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver and is serious global public health problem with a high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer, diseases that kill about one million persons each year globally. Globally, of the 2 billion people who have been infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), more than 350 million have chronic (lifelong) infections. It is preventable with safe and effective vaccines that have been available since 1982. Although the vaccine will not cure chronic hepatitis, it is 95% effective in preventing chronic infections from developing, and is the first vaccine against a major human cancer. More than 160 countries have already added this vaccine to their routine immunization programmes. Available epidemiologic studies in India and AP indicate that India is in intermediate endemic status (with a prevalence of 2 to 7%) and the best way to reduce the prevalence as per the strategies outlined by WHO is to introduce Hep-B vaccine into routine immunization. AP is the first State in India to introduce Hep-B vaccine in the routine immunization in a phased manner. In-spite of the initial apprehensions and slow take up, the program is proven to be successful and Govt. of India has made budgetary provisions in the 10th plan for introduction in rest of India.","1242":"The partnership project with Gates foundation grant in 2001 was rolled out in a phased manner to strengthen routine immunization with introduction of Hepatitis B and AD syringes into immunization program. Initial success lead to reworking of plans for fast expansion, in three years with consolidation and strengthening in last two years. With introduction of AD Syringes the issue of safe disposal became prominent. Operational research on the safety box led to modifications in the prototype, introduced new challenges to find local manufacturers to make the product for wider introduction. This improved scope to coordinate with other projects to integrate safe injection pits into the disposal system, try out new solutions for sharps waste management in light of new pollution control guidelines. Study at Mehboobnagar district point towards feasibility of introducing small puncture proof containers and needle cutters as a solution for sharps waste management at the rural settings. Injection safety has been introduced in immunization sector and the challenge still remains to extend this to the curative sector, which contributes to more than 90% of the problem.","1243":"The GOAP-PATH partnership project provided an opportunity to carryout situational analysis of the cold chain system in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Apart from identifying areas of work many quality issues like freezing of vaccine were brought to light, which lead to development of a comprehensive plan of action for total overhauling of cold chain system. Introduction of new technologies, training, infrastructure and software development has reformed the cold chain system. The EVSM (Effective vaccine stores management initiative) self assessment was done recently for the Central vaccine stores at Hyderabad and the results of this self assessment has raised the confidence of health personnel to aim for WHO, EVSM accreditation for central vaccine store at Hyderabad.","1244":"Japanese encephalitis is demonstrated to be a significant public health problem in India and throughout Asia. JE primarily affects children between the ages of one and 15 years. Of those who contract the disease, approximately 70% either die or are left with a long-term neurological disability. JE vaccines have existed for a very long time, however due to cost and unstable supply, they have not been able to meet the needs of developing country health systems. In addition, alternative JE control measures have proven insufficient to control disease. As a result, 68 percent of babies born in the poorest countries of Asia are at risk for JE. Against this background, future directions for JE activities in India include control through vaccination when an affordable vaccine is available (at risk areas), strengthening surveillance data on disease patterns including age and geographic distribution, involvement of the private sector and incorporation of newer diagnostics as they become available and to focus on control efforts and prevent this debilitating disease now and in the future. Recent work, both internationally and in India, offers hope to help solve this public health problem and protect children from this disease.","1245":"The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and The Vaccine Fund are two major global initiatives adopted with the objectives of improving access to immunization services particularly in the underdeveloped and developing countries and introduction of new but under-used vaccines in the developing countries in particular where these diseases are highly prevalent. GAVI is a collaborative mission that brings together governments in developing and industrialized countries, UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, vaccine manufacturers and all other stake holders to harness the strengths and experiences of multiple partners in immunization. The Vaccine Fund is a financing mechanism established to mobilize resources to serve the mission of GAVI. This article reviews the objectives, strategies, organization and the funding issues of this global initiative. In the Indian perspective, GAVI is presently playing a major role in introduction of Hepatitis-B vaccine for infants in India.

A Cross sectional time bound study was conducted in seven centres, where OPV vials were stored prior to IPPI and 20 IPPI Booths in UT, Chandigarh. Booths were selected by stratified random sampling technique. The status of cold chain equipments was assessed at headquarter of IPPI, 6 regional (distribution) centres, 20 IPPI posts and 5 house to house teams. The cold chain sickness rate was found to be 9.7% in January, 2002. There were reports of breakdown of cold chain maintenance due to defective plugs and sockets, faults in thermostat, leakage of gas. But all vaccine samples picked up randomly were reported potent, as per the test reports provided by Central Research Institute (CRI), Kasauli during the period of study. Temperature charting and cold chain maintenance was found satisfactory, but necessity of improvement, specially regarding the handling of vaccines by the female health worker. Lids of vaccine carriers not closed tightly, frequent opening of lids during immunization, direct exposure of vaccine to atmospheric temperature, keeping the vaccine vial in hand or pocket.

Mean arsenic concentration in nail and hair samples of exposed group was also found higher than the prescribed limit.","1260":"Leptospirosis is an important occupational disease affecting people coming in contact with animals and their discharges. The occurrence of infection in ones workplaces is linked to the environment to which the worker is exposed and the adaptability of the organism in that working environment. Rodents usually abound in underground sewers and are carriers of leptospira. The urine of rodents and other animals present in that area is likely to contaminate these sewers. Leptospira are excreted in the urine of infected animals. Thus sewer workers are at a potential risk of leptospirosis. The prevalence of leptospirosis in these workers could thus indirectly predict the presence of the disease in animals in a particular geographical niche. Total seventy-eight sewer workers from 5 different municipal wards in Pune were examined to find out the evidence of past infection with leptospira using microagglutination test (MAT). The prevalence rate was found to be 16.6%. The serovars to which antibodies were detected include autumnalis (38.4%), pyrogenes (23.0%), canicola (15.3%) and pomona (15.3%). Evidence of leptospiral infection was found to be maximum in sewer workers in the areas of the city that were infested with rodents and stray animals.","1261":"A study was conducted in 12 First Referral Units (FRUs), selected through multistage sampling, from 6 districts of West Bengal. Infrastructure facilities, record keeping, referral system and MCH indicators related to newborn care were documented.

Inadequate infrastructure facilities (e.g. no sanctioned posts of specialists, no blood bank at rural hospitals declared as First Referral Units etc.); poor utilization of equipment like neonatal resuscitation sets, radiant warmer etc, lack of training of the service providers were evident. Records\/registers were available but incomplete. Referral system was found to be almost nonexistent. Most of the deliveries (86.1%) were normal delivery. Deliveries (87.71%) and immediate neonatal resuscitation (94.9%) were done mostly by nursing personnel. Institution based maternal, perinatal and early neonatal mortality rates were found to be 5.6, 62.4 and 25.2 per 1000 live births respectively. Eclampsia (48.9%), hemorrhage (17.7%), puerperal sepsis (7.1%) were reported to be major causes of maternal mortality. Common causes of early neonatal mortality were birth asphyxia (54.3%), sepsis (14.6%) and prematurity\/LBW (12.4%).","1262":"The determinants of utilisation of subcentre services in a random sample of 247 subcentres from three out of 14 districts of Kerala were investigated.

About 30 per cent of the beneficiaries utilised services of the subcentres during the reference period. The relationship of selected predictor variables on utilisation of the services was found out. The district in which a subcentre was physically present was found to be the most important correlate of its utilisation.","1263":"The purpose of the study was to discuss the interpretation of epidemiological trends in leprosy, using currently available indicators. A number of leprosy-endemic countries and regions were chosen for which epidemiological data have been published for a period of at least 15 years. Using these examples, relative merit of the registered prevalence rate, the case detection rate, the children proportion among new cases and proportion of new cases with grade 2 disability will examined for interpreting the leprosy situation in these countries. Considerable drop of the registered prevalence rates (PR) were evident in all endemic countries. However, this decline was due largely to shortening of treatment and 'cleaning' of leprosy registers and has not been reflected in the annual case detection rates (CDR), except in a few countries. The proportion of new cases with grade 2 impairment had decreased substantially, which indicates earlier case finding. However, the proportion of children among new cases did not change much in the past decade. It is indicate that transmission is still continuing. We reiterate the conclusion of the ILA Technical Forum that the (annual) case detection rate is the most appropriate indicator for monitoring of leprosy situation in a given country or area. Two additional indicators that helped to interpret the CDR were the proportion of new cases with grade 2 impairments, reflecting the delay between occurrence and diagnosis of the disease, and the proportion of children among new cases, which is used as a proxy indicator for recent transmission.","1264":"","1265":"A training programme was developed and implemented for 56 primary school teachers of Barasat II block in North 24 Parganas district as per their recommended roles and responsibilities in School health service.

Data on ninetten covariates of infant and child mortality for twenty major Indian states were used for the analysis. The covariates were based on socio-economic, demographic and mother's health care variables, morbidity and mortality indicators. An index for each state was obtained using statistical technique of factor analysis. Thie index measure health care needs of a state relative to the difference between the best and the worst states. Mapping of twenty states was done using cluster analysis. Eleven states had an inded of above 50, which shows greater care should be emphasized on health care variables to reduce mortality. Mapping using cluster analysis revealed a picture of natural clusters. The map with the index could help the health managers, social scientists and policy makers to identify areas that require more interventions. It could also help to comapre the various health intervention schemes that have been followed in the states, to devise more effective strategies for control of mortality and improvement of survival of young children.","1294":"The present study revealed perception of forty-five patients and fifty nine family members selected from the outpatinet deptt. of a Psychiatric hospital.

Unfortunately, complexity, cost and need of skilled personnel limit the use of screening tools of high validity in developing countries. The disease load estimated with tools of low validity differs considerably from true disease load, particularly for diseases of extreme levels of prevalence\/incidence. A tool of 70% sensitivity and specificity may yield a prevalence\/incidence rate of 34% (CI: 32.23-35.67%) for a disease whose true rate is only 10.0% (CI: 8.94-11.06%). We proposed a procedure to derive the true estimate in such cases, based on the concepts of sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic\/screening test. It is applied on two sets of real data--one pertaining to incidence rate of low birth weight (LBW) and the other to prevalence rate of obesity--where multiple screening tests of varying validity were used to estimate the magnitude. Different screening tests yielded widely varying incidence\/prevalence rates of LBW\/obesity. The prevalence\/incidence rates derived by using the proposed estimation procedure are similar and close to the true estimate obtained by screening tests considered as gold standard. Further, sample size determined on the basis of the results of a tool of low validity may be either larger or smaller than the required sample size. Estimation of true disease load enables determination of correct sample size, thus improving the precision of the estimate and, in some instances, reducing the cost of investigation.","1344":"","1345":"","1346":"","1347":"","1348":"Geriatric population forms a significant proportion of our total population.

Data on socio-demographic factors was collected using an open ended questionnaire. Nutritional status was assessed using anthropometric measurements of height, weight, mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and body mass index (BMI). Information on dietary profile was collected by 24 hour dietary recall method. Fasting practices were also studied. Socio-demographic data of geriatric men of high, middle and low income groups revealed that majority of the subjects were married. A greater percentage of high income group (HIG) men had nuclear family whereas majority of low income groups (LIG) elderly men resided in a joint family. Socio-demographic profile of elderly women of all the 3 income groups revealed that most of the subjects were Hindus. The percentage of widowhood, illiteracy and joint family system were higher in LIG as compared to the elderly women in middle and high income groups (MIG and HIG). Nutrient intake data of elderly men of all the income groups revealed lower consumption of energy, protein, iron and beta-carotene as compared to the RDA whereas fats and vitamin C intakes were higher as compared to the RDA (p &lt; 0.05). The mean nutrient intake, by the LIG elderly women, in terms of energy, protein, iron, calcium, beta-carotene and vitamin C were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than the RDA as well as when compared to the elderly women of MIG and HIG. Mean anthropometric measurements of weight and BMI were higher in elderly HIG and MIG men as compared to the elderly men from LIG. Significant difference was found in all the anthropometric measurements of elderly women of LIG as compared to HIG and MIG.

Seventy three percent of them reported participation in continuing training sessions. However, analysis of attendance register showed that only 35.4% had attended more than 50% sessions in year 1993. Most (83.5%) of the TBAs gave advice to pregnant women for increased food intake, 47% advised tetanus toxoid, 16.5% for more rest, and 31.6% for iron tablets. Many of them were aware of maternal complications i.e. anaemia (64.6%), oedema (26.6%), bleeding per veginum (39.2%), abnormal presentation (77.2%) and high fever (48.1%). Risks to newborn like low birth weight, fever, cough\/rapid breathing and hypothermia were known to 20.2%, 31.6%, 17.7% and 1.3% of the TBAs respectively. Knowledge regarding causes of low birth weight baby like 'weak' mother, less diet in pregnancy, short birth interval and preterm delivery were reported by 69.6%, 63.3%, 12.6% and 3.8% respectively. About two fifth of TBAs advised referral to hospital in case of prolonged labour and 88.6% for very low birth weight babies. Disposable Dai Kit and weighing machine were available with 32% and 73% TBAs. Significantly higher proportion of TBAs participating in continuing training advised tetanus toxoid vaccination, appropriate feeding practices of the newborn, hospital referral in case of prolonged labour and were less inclined to advise injection to speed up labour. Therefore, efforts should be made to increase the attendance of TBAs in continuing training sessions so as to sustain modern maternal and newborn care practices acquired after initial training.","1350":"A community based study to examine the extent of contamination of supplementary milk feeds of 149 children aged 6-24 months was conducted in a semi urban slum of Varanasi, India. Out of 201 children, 149 top milk samples were collected directly from the feeding utensils into a sterile vial and subjected to bacteriological analysis. Overall, 53.7% of milk samples were contaminated by bacteria and among them 16.1% were potentially enteropathogenic in nature. The distribution of pathogens was E. coli (13.4%), Klebsiella spp (5.4%), Enterobacter spp. (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.7%), Shigella spp. (2.7%) and others (22.1%). The rate of contamination was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) in lower income group (73.4%), lower caste (69.6%) and in case of illiterate mothers (69.3%).

The prevalence of bilateral blindness (vision &lt; 6\/60 in the better eye) was 11.68 percent (95% C.I. 10.54-12.81). The age-gender adjusted blindness prevalence rate was 11.04 percent (95% C.I. 11.033-11.044). Age and occupational status were associated with blindness prevalence. Cataract was the commonest cause of low vision and blindness in this population. Respondents aged 60-69 years had a 2.74 times higher risk, while those aged 70 years+ had a 4.86 times higher risk of being blind, compared to those 50-59 years. Productively employed individuals had lowest blindness rates. Blindness rates were five times higher among respondents who were not working and two times higher among those engaged solely in household activities. The prevalence of cataract was 43.32 percent (95% C.I. 41.14-45.50) among those aged 50+ years. The prevalence increased with increasing age. Gender did not influence the prevalence of cataract in the present survey.

The basic strategies to eradicate polio are: attaining high routine coverage with at least three doses of OPV; conducting national immunization days (NIDs) in polio endemic countries; establishing a sensitive system of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance to track wild poliovirus circulation; and conducting \"mopping-up\" immunization when polio is reduced to focal transmission. By the end of 2000. India was in the midst of the sixth National Immunization Days (NIDs). Surveillance system for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) continued to achieve the recommended non-polio AFP rate of at least 1 per 100,000 population &lt; 15 years per year (1.88 for week 51 ending 23rd December 2000), the adequate stool specimen collection rate was 83% that met the target of &gt; 80%. Some States in the south and west have started to implement mopping-up immunization campaigns as the end-stage strategy to eliminate the last remaining foci of transmission. While most of India appears to be well placed to eradicate polio by the end of 2000 or shortly thereafter, concerns remain about low coverage in parts of the densely populated northern States of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where high intensity transmission persists. The Government of India has embarked upon an intensified strategy that relies on extra rounds of NIDs; house-to-house immunization to reach previously missed children; and aggressive mopping-up campaigns including pre-emptive mopping-up in the known reservoirs in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Extensive microplanning and supervision of the supplementary immunization activities is critical to achieve the target of polio eradication.","1365":"","1366":"","1367":"","1368":"To Detect the risk of still birth in different maternal age, five year (1st January 1993 to 31st December 1997) record of Government Medical College, Nagpur were analysed.

Data reveals that out of 15, 10 states have more than 95% coverage for at least 3 doses, MP and Gujarat at the top with 99% coverage. Despite this high coverage level, huge number of children is still unreached. Nearly 5 lakh children are left out in UP alone. Ironically, higher proportion of urban clusters have zero dose children. Apart from lack of awareness about date and need of additional doses, lack of positive attitude among parents are major cause of not getting any of the doses.

The perception of state level officers about important job responsibilities of other departments in relation to disaster management and its intersectoral co-ordination was found mostly satisfactory; but this desired status did not prevail at district level. Lack of co-ordination among some sectors at district levels persisted in Murshidabad district, indicating comparatively better intersectoral co-ordination in Midnapore district. Thus, 'early response following flood' the most important indicator of adequacy of pre-disaster preparedness was found significantly better in Midnapore district. On the contrary, due to liberal use of Radio transmission set for flood warning, a significantly higher proportion of affected families in Murshidabad district received early flood warning compared to Midnapore.

Paucity of information about nutritional status of street children compared to that among urban slum dwellers, squatters or rural\/tribal population is quite evident. The present study revealed the magnitude of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and few associated factors among a sample of 435 underfives belonging to pavement dweller families and selected randomly from clusters of such families, from each of the five geographical sectors of Calcutta city. Overall prevalence of PEM was found almost similar (about 70%) to that among other 'urban poor' children viz. slum dwellers etc., but about 16% of them were found severely undernourished (Grade III &amp; V of IAP classification of PEM). About 35% and 70% of street dweller children had wasting and stunting respectively. Severe PEM (Grade III &amp; IV) was more prevalent among 12-23 months old, girl child, those belonged to illiterate parents and housewife mothers rather than wage earners. It also did increase with increase of birth rate of decrease of birth interval. This document presents a cross-sectional survey concerning the magnitude of protein energy  malnutrition (PEM) and its associated factors among 435 under-5 pavement-dwelling children in  Calcutta.  Results revealed that 69.43% were undernourished and that 16% of them were  suffering from severe malnutrition (grade III and IV of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics criteria  for PEM).  The 24-35 month age group had the highest prevalence of malnutrition (82.93%)  followed by the 36-47 and 12-23 month age groups with prevalences of 76.19% and 74.03%,  respectively.  Prevalence of severe grade malnutrition was noted to be three times higher in  females (24.76%) than males (8.45%), and among families it increased in direct proportion to  birth rate and inverse proportion to birth interval.  Moreover, children of illiterate parents and  nonworking mothers had a higher incidence of severe PEM.

The children were physically examined for 3 grades of goiter.  Urine  samples were collected to estimate iodine excretion.  Various types of salts were gathered from   retailers' outlets located within a 0.5 km radius of the school that the children attended.  Spot test  kit and iodimetric titration methods were used in monitoring the availability of iodized salt.   Results showed that all packed salts were iodized and that a majority of them (98.1% at the  household level and 93.6% at the retailers' outlet level) had iodine levels of 15 ppm or higher.   Only a small percentage of salts (0.5% at the household level and 1.0% at the retailers' outlet  level) had no iodine content.  As to the urinary iodine content among school children, 22.95% of  males and 31.81% of females had urinary iodine level less than 50 mcg\/l.  77% of male children  and 69% of female children had satisfactory urinary iodine levels (50 mcg\/l).

The program solicits the support of  various departments in implementing the dietary modification and supplementation measures.   Pregnant women are recommended to have one big tablet per day for 100 days after the first  trimester of pregnancy; a similar dose applies to lactating women and IUD acceptors.  Preschool  children (ages 1-5 years) are recommended to take one small tablet per day for 100 days every  year.  Adult tablets contain 100 mg iron and 500 mg folic acid, while pediatric tablets contain 20  mg iron and 100 mg folic acid.  For treatment of severe anemia, women in the reproductive age  group are recommended to take three adult tablets per day for a minimum of 100 days.  Drinking  tea is discouraged, as it may inhibit the absorption of iron in the stomach.  There are proposed  initiatives to improve coverage, quality, and efficiency of the NNACP in the Ninth Plan period.

The package of services provided by the ICDS scheme includes supplementary nutrition, immunization, health check-up, referral services, nutrition and health education, and pre-school education. The distribution of iron and folic acid tablets and megadose of vitamin A is also undertaken, to prevent iron deficiency anaemia and xerophthalmia respectively. The scheme services are rendered essentially through the Anganwadi worker (AWW) at a village centre called \"Anganwadi\". The ICDS had led to (i) reduction in prevalence of severe grades of malnutrition and (ii) better utilization of services of national nutritional anaemia prophylaxis programme and the national programme for prevention of nutritional blindness due to vitamin A deficiency by ICDS beneficiaries. The ICDS scheme is being modified continuously to strengthen the programme. This article presents the impact of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) on the  nutritional status of mothers and of children under 6 years old in India.  ICDS is the first and  probably the only program in the country that aims at the holistic development of an individual.   The reduction in prevalence of severe malnutrition is comparatively more significant in ICDS  scheme population than in other population groups.  There has been an extensive improvement in  the nutritional status of children living in rural, urban and tribal areas and in those belonging to  depressed sections of the community.  The new initiative schemes for supplementary nutrition  include: (a) improved monitoring mechanisms, (b) increased and improved norms of nutrition,  (c) improved acceptability of supplementary recipes, (d) care of the severely malnourished, (e)  the formation of a state level committee of experts, (f) inspection of quality, and (g) the  introduction of community growth charts for malnourished children.

Approximately two thirds received parenteral therapy.","1401":"In India, lymphatic filariasis persists as a major cause of clinical morbidity and as an impediment to socio-economic development. The direct costs incurred for the treatment of adeno-lymphangitis (ADL) episodes and the consequent indirect costs due to loss of income were determined from selected agricultural labour-intensive rural endemic pockets in Tamil Nadu. Information on the occurrence of ADL, its frequency and duration were collected using semi-structured questionnaire from randomly selected patients afflicted with chronic manifestations of bancroftian filariasis. Direct (treatment) cost per year per patient was found to range from Rs. 30 to 101 among patients with different manifestations. Income foregone (indirect cost) annually by each patient, which is a function of frequency and duration of ADL ranged from Rs. 182 to 702. ADL episodes among filarial patients alone cost a minimum of Rs. 4515 million for the nation every year. Cost benefit analysis of filariasis control programme in India showed that the benefits in terms of savings on treatment and work lost due ADL alone exceeded the cost by 24%. The per capita cost of the National Filaria Control Programme was calculated to be Rs. 2.6 per annuam.","1402":"","1403":"A study was conducted in Sunderpur, Varanasi to study the magnitude of the problem of acute Respiratory Infections among under five children in an urban slum and the clinical profile of it in order to understand the pattern of disease presentation for identifying methods of early diagnosis and timely intervention. 150 under five children were selected by stratified random sampling method and were observed for 52 weeks at weekly interval to record the illnesses. In total 661 episodes were observed in 5623 child-weeks of observation giving an episode rate of 6.11 per child per year. ARI accounted for 67% of all morbidities. Mean duration of all the episodes taken together was 8.15 + 5.44 days. Majority of the episodes (88.96%) were confined to the Upper Respiratory Tract only. Most commonly occurring clinical features were rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness and cough. 61.4% of all the episodes terminated within seven days, and only 26.2% continued for two weeks.","1404":"The efficacy evaluation of three formulations; wettable powder (W.P.) floating pellet and beads of Bacillus thuringiensis Var israelensis (Bti), revealed a greater susceptibility of the early larval instars of mosquitoes to Bti, sensitivity of anophelines to floating pellet, culicines to bead and equal efficacy and faster kill of W.P. to all the mosquitoes tested. A greater persistence of the slow release formulations, floating pellet and beads for 49 and 28 days against anophelines and culicines respectively was observed in contrast to a maximum persistence for 21 days in case of W.P. formulation.","1405":"Missed opportunity for immunisation is one of the hurdles in the achievement of 85 percent or more immunisation coverage. It is essential to screen every child for immunisation status and advise necessary immunisation at every opportunity otherwise full immunisation coverage may not be possible. Present survey was carried out at Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Nagpur to study the sociomedical correlates of missed opportunities for immunisation in children below 2 years of age attending the hospital. Missed opportunities for immunisation in these children was found to be 39.9%. It is mostly for B. C. G. (21.8%) and measles (9.8%) and maximum for booster doses of DPT and polio (43%).","1406":"In India breast feeding in rural areas appears to be shaped by the health beliefs of a community, which are further influenced by social, cultural and economic factors. One of such tradition is prelacteal feeding which is widely prevalent since ancient times. The present study was aimed to find out the practice of prelacteal feeding and various factors which influence this practice. The study on analysis showed that 45% (90) mothers gave prelacteal feeds to their newborns in the form of sugar water, gur water or cow's milk. Sugar water was common amongst mothers belonging to nuclear family (49%) whereas gur water was given mostly by joint family mothers (75.70%). Parity and family type had no significant effect on this practice, however the effect of literacy was found to be significantly related to the practice.","1407":"Two hundred sixty eight antenatal mothers were observed for the quality of services provided by Auxillary Nurse Midwives (ANMs). History taking was found to be satisfactory in only 2.6% women. Obstetric examination was done unsatisfactorily in majority (52.6%) of the mothers. General physical examination was not done in 69% women. ANMs in all 31 sub-centres were not performing investigation like haemoglobin estimation, urine testing, foetal heart sound monitoring and blood pressure recording.","1408":"Data collected on 689 infants, in a study to assess the incidence of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections during infancy, is used here to quantify the extent of under-reporting in diarrhoea morbidity surveys. The study area consisted of two contiguous primary health centres in Villupuram health unit district in Tamil Nadu, South India. Each day of infancy was assigned a recal period and proportion of diarrhoeal days for various recall period computed. The proportion of diarrhoea was 11.3%, 12.0% and 11.2% for zero, one and two days of recall period, respectively, after which the proportion decreased. The under-reporting of diarrhoea was approximately 15%, 26% and 45% with three, six and 7-13 days of recall period, respectively. As there is considerable under-reporting of diarrhoea morbidity when recall period exceeds three days, it would be best to collect information on diarrhoea at least twice a week in diarrhoeal morbidity surveys.","1409":"The objective of this study was to assess the correlation between waist circumference and waist hip ratio and body mass index. Also to assess if a simple measurement like the waist circumference can be used as an independent indicator for detecting health risk and management. 500 men and 500 women were included in this study from the out patient department and indoor wards of Medical College, Calcutta. Only 7% of the males and 16% of the females had body mass index &gt; or = 25. About 50% of both males and females had waist hip ratio above the desirable range (0.80 for females and 0.95 for males). About 99% of females with, waist circumference &gt; or = 72 cm. had either body mass index &gt; or = 25 or high waist hip ratio &gt; or = 0.80 or both. Similarly 99% of males with waist circumference &gt; or = 80 cm. had either high body mass index &gt; or = 25 or high waist hip ratio &gt; or = 0.90 or both. Waist circumference is simple to assess and can be used as an independent measurement to identify those at risk from either increased body weight or central fat distribution or both.","1410":"Children attending the anganwadi centres were fed with Ready to eat (RTE) food containing 2g of Red Palm Oil (RPO). Daily children's attendance, their participation in the feeding programme, quantity of food supplement consumed were recorded. Heights, weights, clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency and morbidity pattern of the beneficiary children were assessed. There was increase in attendance of the children in the feeding programme after introduction of RPO. Quantity of the food supplement consumed by the children also increased. An improvement in the nutritional grades of children was observed. Signs of vitamin A deficiency were absent. Anganwadi teachers, helpers and parents accepted the inclusion of RPO in the supplementary feeding programme.","1411":"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) was exposed to different adverse conditions for varying period of time to assess its survival under such circumstances.

Total seventeen villages were selected around KAPS, which were divided into four clusters. Total population was 14,976, of which 7540 were male and 7436 were female. Door to door 100% survey was conducted with the help of Medical doctor. Health survey was conducted specially to find out the prevalence of radiation related diseases such as congenital deformity, mental retardation, cataract, goiter (grade II &amp; IV), reproductive disorders, and cancer, besides study of morbidity pattern and age and sex specific deaths. Results revealed that prevalent diseases pattern fell well within the range of natural incidences of diseases of rural population.","1413":"The present study has been conducted to assess social and behavioural factors predisposing individuals suffering from sexually transmitted diseases to seek treatment and the role of the health provider in them. Out results showed that the demographic, socio-economic and behavioural characteristics of patients seeking treatment at alternative places and those attending the referral hospital in the first instance were comparable. Inhibition, time and distance were important considerations for selecting a health facility. Private clinics were the most preferred (72.4%) source of treatment. In 60.3% of cases written prescriptions were not given and advice regarding treatment of sexual partner was not there in any of the cases. 98.3% of the patients lacked awareness about their disease and 91.4% patients about the treatment they were receiving. The prospective study was conducted on 100 patients attending the Dermatology and Venereal  Diseases Department of Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi, to investigate the socioeconomic and  behavioral factors that may influence treatment-seeking behavior for sexually transmitted diseases  (STDs).  All the subjects were interviewed using a pretested, semistructured questionnaire.  Results  showed that socioeconomic factors affect the utilization of STD services in many individuals.   Accessibility to health care services in terms of time and money were important determinants of  treatment-seeking behavior of the patient.  This present study clearly documents that the majority of  patients (98%) were unaware of their diagnosis, treatment and the seriousness of their illnesses.   Furthermore, the media failed to charge the treatment-seeking behavior of STD patients, though it  was considered as an important source of public education on the various aspects of STD. ","1414":"Presterilized (disposable) syringes and needles were subjected to sterility testing for aerobic cultures. It was found that 56.3% of the samples were contaminated indicating failure of the sterilisation process.

Primary drug resistance to Isoniazid was 45% to Rifampicin was 27%, to Ethambutol was 9%, and to Streptomycin was 54%. Secondary drug resistance to Isoniazid was 68% to Rifampicin was 60%, to Ethambutol was 8% and to Streptomycin was 36%. Secondary drug resistance to Isoniazid and Rifampicin is rising as compared to primary drug resistance to Isoniazid and Rifampicin. This is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). 11 out of 36 cases (30%) showed multi drug resistance to Isoniazid and Rifampicin.","1416":"A 5 year sentinel surveillance (1989-93) of paralytic poliomyelitis and neonatal tetanus was undertaken at a rural Medical College Hospital at Burdwan, West Bengal. Poliomyelitis incidence showed an overall declining trend, which corroborated with the increased OPV coverage over the years. Incidence was more in males than females. Male:female ratio varied between 2.31:1 to 1.2:1. From 1989 to 1992, age-shift in poliomyelitis was observed when more cases were occurring above 1 year subjects. Cases were reported to be high during the months June to September every year. Incidence of neonatal tetanus (NNT) also showed a declining trend during the 5 year study period. A male preponderance was observed. NNT cases were more prevalent during the months between August and November. In an attempt for eradication of paralytic poliomyelitis and elimination of NNT, containment and other public health measures were undertaken a part of surveillance activities. The obstacles encountered in the surveillance system, as well as lacunae identified in undertaking appropriate health measures was discussed. The authors report on the 5-year sentinel surveillance (1989-93) of paralytic poliomyelitis and  neonatal tetanus (NNT) undertaken at the rural Medical College Hospital at Burdwan, West Bengal.   Overall, the incidence of poliomyelitis showed a declining trend in relation to increased OPV  coverage over the years.  From 1989 to 1992, an age shift in poliomyelitis was observed among  children over 1 year old.  Similarly to poliomyelitis, NNT also showed a declining trend during the  5-year study period.  The NNT cases were observed to increased during the months from August to  November.  While performing the surveillance activities, a number of obstacles were encountered  in data collection, data recording, and data transmission.  Some of these problems include lack of  motivation with concerned personnel, shortage of manpower particularly in the pediatric  department and erroneous recording of address, nonrecording of immunization status and final  diagnosis in the admission registry.  As part of the surveillance activities, public health measures  were undertaken to eliminate paralytic poliomyelitis and NNT. ","1417":"A Comparative study of three types of measles vaccines was undertaken among 1005 children. Of these 527 were vaccinated with the Serum Institute of India (SII) vaccine, 230 with Schwarz (SC) and 248 were vaccinated with Edmonston-Zegreb (EZ) vaccine (imported from Zegreb). Though the majority of children reacted favourably with all the three vaccines (SII: 98.43%; SC: 93.40%; EZ: 93.0%) with a rise in titre, but the percentage of seroconversion was significantly higher with the SII vaccine (p &lt; 0.01). The Schwarz and Edmonston Zagreb vaccines showed significantly less GM titre as compared with the other age group i.e. 9-12 months (p &lt; 0.05). With Serum Institute of India (SII) vaccine the GM titres were almost similar in the different age groups. The overall GM titre obtained with the SII vaccine was significantly higher than the SC vaccine (p &gt; 0.001) as well as the EZ vaccine (p &gt; 0.001). It is of interest to note that among the infants, 22.5% children had measles antibody in them before vaccination. This study compares the efficacy of the three types of measles vaccines undertaken among 1005  children at the General Hospital pediatrics department in Pune, India.  Of these children, 527 were  vaccinated with the Serum Institute of India (SII) vaccine, 230 with Schwarz (SC), and 258 were  vaccinated with Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) vaccine.  Results showed that the percentage of  seroconversion was significantly higher with SII vaccine (98.43%) when compared with the SC  (93.40%) or the EZ vaccines (93.0%).  Majority of the children reacted favorably with the 3  vaccines after the rise in titer.  The GM titer in the age group less than 9 months of the Schawarz  vaccine was significantly less as compared with 9-12 months.  The EZ vaccine also showed  significantly less GM titer in the age group less than 9 months compared with the 13-18 month  group.  The SII vaccine and the GM titer were almost similar in different age groups.  The overall  GM titer obtained in the SII vaccine was significantly higher than the SC and the EZ vaccines.   From this study, a direction to the strategy of measles vaccination was enlightened. ","1418":"450 hospitalised cases of hepatic and non hepatic disorders and 100 normal individuals were examined for serum Hepatitis B Surface antigen and Delta Virus antigen by ELISA to find out its association with different clinical disorders. 105 patients (23.3%) and 2 control (2%) were positive for HBsAG. 60 cases with jaundice (26%) were HBsAg positive. 65% of HBsAg positive jaundiced patients had serum bilirubin level more than 2 mg per dl with a mean SGPT level of 488 iu\/L. Only two cases were positive for HDV antigen among 60 HBsAg positive jaundice patients indicating a lower rate of prevalence of infection (3.3%). 62 (59%) out of 105 HBsAg positive cases did not show any history of blood transfusion or surgical interference indicating a positive HBV transmission through needle prick during investigative procedures. This study was carried out at Nil Ratan Sarkar Medical College, Calcutta from December 1993-95  among 450 patients with hepatic and nonhepatic disorders and 100 normal individuals.  The study  was conducted to examine the association between serum Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and  Delta virus (HDV) antigen, and different clinical disorders.  Serum was tested for bilirubin and  serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and detection of HBsAg and HDV antigen.  Results  showed that the presence of HBsAg was found highest in cirrhosis of liver (42.3%), followed by  leukemia (32.1%), hepatitis (29.1%), and jaundice (26%).  About 65% of HBsAg positive  jaundiced patients had a serum bilirubin level of more than 2mg\/dl, with a mean SGPT level of  488iu\/l.  Only two cases were positive for HDV antigen among 60 HBsAg positive jaundice  patients, indicating a lower prevalence rate of infection.

The probability for duodenal ulcer was within confidence limits among all social groups.","1421":"","1422":"Thalassaemia patients receiving repeated blood transfusions are vulnerable to transfusion related infections. HIV infection is the most life threatening of them all. Blood being the most efficient mode of transmission of HIV, increases the risk of infection even further. Although the National AIDS Control programme has laid down stringent rules regarding blood safety, it remained to be seen whether they were being followed meticulously especially in rural areas. The present study was conducted to identify the HIV status of multi-transfused thalassaemia patients attending hospital blood banks of rural Bengal. Only 3 (0.9%) of the 330 thalassaemia patients examined were found to be HIV positive. Although the situation has not reached alarming proportions, yet appropriate control measures must be adopted on a mass scale to prevent further spread of the world wide pandemic.","1423":"Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) is a major public health problem. Surveys conducted by the National Goitre Survey team of the Directorate General of Health Services during the past three decades have revealed a high prevalence of endemic goitre in different states. Out of a total of 267 districts surveyed till date, 226 have been reported to be endemic to iodine deficiency. A successful measure for the prevention of IDD is salt iodisation. The Salt department, Government of India has taken an intensive programme of production of iodised salt in the country. The production has increased from 1.5 lakh metric tonnes in 1984 to 40 lakh metric tonnes in 1996. To assess the impact of increased production of iodised salt on the availability of iodised salt at the beneficiary and trader level and also on the status of iodine deficiency, surveys were undertaken in selected districts of 10 states and 2 union territories of the country.

Use of intrauterine device (OR = 3.98, p &lt; 0.0001), sexual activity with multiple partners and younger age (ORs = 3.97, 1.9 and p = 0.0003, 0.0034, respectively), history of previous PID (OR = 4.08, p = 0.004) and history of minor gynecologic operation (OR = 3.07, p = 0.0158) were significant risk factors for PID. Pregnancy was a significant protective factor (OR = 0.25, p = .0074). Sterilisation had a significant protective effect (OR = 0.37, p = 0.0443) on multivariate analysis but not significant on univariate analysis. The results indicated that, almost half of the PID load on the population can be reduced by proper handling of four risk factors namely, use of IUD, sexual activity with multiple partners, history of previous PID and history of minor gynecologic operation (PARP = 0.2146, 0.1101, 0.0824 and 0.0794, respectively).","1433":"In the present study 625 females above 15 years of age residing in affluent localities of Varanasi city were selected by multi-stage stratified random sampling technique. Body Mass Index (BMI) and Skin-Fold Thickness (SFT) were compared as indices of obesity. Prevalence of obesity by BMI and SFT was 30.24 and 49.12 respectively. SFT gave significantly higher prevalence rate of obesity as compared to BMI. It is possible that western population based SFT cut-off points may not be truly applicable to Indian study. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of 'sum of SFT at four sites' were calculated at different cut-off points, and it was observed, that values &gt; or = 90 mm is the best cut-off point instead of 80 mm, for detecting obesity in the Indian context.","1434":"A pilot survey was undertaken in an urban district population of West Bengal, to study the magnitude of problems of Neurological disorders in the Community.

Dengue outbreaks occur almost regularly and sometimes reach epidemic proportions in cities and towns.  Dengue endemicity in Calcutta was established for the first time in 1960, then re-established by another serosurvey in 1966.  An outbreak of dengue was recently reported in the Bankura district of the city, where it has not previously been reported.  With the literature suggesting a recent change in the epidemiology of dengue, probably due to the invasion of suburban and urban areas by A. aegypti and A. albopictus, respectively, a preliminary study was conducted to determine whether A. albopictus has gained a foothold in Calcutta.  A larval and adult survey of Aedes species conducted from October 1995 to September 1996 in crowded areas of the city and an urban garden in central city found both A. aegypti and A. albopictus present in the surveyed areas as larvae and adults.  A. albopictus, however, is competing with, and attempting to displace, A. aegypti.","1438":"There has been a growing interest during recent years in the role of free radicals and lipid-peroxidation at tissue-level for the causation of cancer and other age-related diseases like atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, cataract etc. Free radicals and increased lipid peroxidation play a significant role for causation of human diseases by oxidative damage and functional degeneration of the tissues. Vitamin C, a well-known dietary antioxidant, and other enzymatic antioxidants like glutathione can protect the lipids of lipoproteins and other biomembranes against peroxidative damage by intercepting oxidants before they can attack the tissues. But cigarette smoking was found to affect the antioxidant protective action of Vitamin C, glutathione etc. A group of adult male smokers in this study were found to have lowered Vitamin 'C' &amp; glutathione levels, but increased lipid-peroxide levels in their blood. Thus the increased pathogenicity of the smoking may also be due to indirect biochemical effect of enhanced oxidative stress by increased lipid-peroxidation and lowered Vitamin C &amp; other antioxidants at tissue-level.","1439":"","1440":"Hospitalization, especially for chronic diseases, can have a number of varied effects upon a patient and his or her family members.

The proportion of diarrhoea was 11.3%, 12.0% and 11.2% for zero, one and two days of recall period, respectively, (mean 11.5%) after which the proportion decreased. The under-reporting of diarrhoea was approximately 15%, 26% and 45% with three, six and 7-13 days of recall period, respectively compared to mean. As there is considerable under-reporting of diarrhoea morbidity when recall period exceeds three days, it would be better to collect information on diarrhoea twice a week in diarrhoeal morbidity surveys. Diarrhea morbidity is an indicator commonly used to assess the health status of young children and to measure the impact of a number of health-related interventions.  In longitudinal studies, information is usually collected orally anywhere from daily to every few weeks.  However, as the recall period lengthens, the likelihood increases that episodes of diarrhea will be forgotten and subsequently not reported, leading to overall underestimates of diarrhea incidence.  Data collected on 689 infants in a 1991-93 study of vitamin A supplementation in mothers and infants were used to quantify the extent of under-reporting in diarrhea morbidity surveys in 2 contiguous primary health centers in Villupuram health unit district in Tamil Nadu, India.  Each day of infancy was assigned a recall period and proportion of diarrheal days for the various recall period computed.  The proportion of diarrhea was 11.3%, 12.0%, and 11.2% for 0, 1, and 2 days of recall period, respectively, after which the proportion decreased.  The under-reporting of diarrhea was approximately 15%, 26%, and 45% with 3, 6, and 7-13 days of recall, respectively, compared to the mean.  Given the high degree of under-reporting of diarrhea morbidity when the recall period exceeds 3 days, it is better to collect data on diarrhea twice a week in diarrheal morbidity surveys.

The study design was a hybrid design using a retrospective Case-Control method superimposed on a population based cross-sectional approach. A total of 9 cases of cholera, confirmed in the laboratory as Vibrio cholerae, 0-1, Eltor, Ogawa were identified using population based survey and compared with 33 controls from the same source population. The overall Incidence rate was 0.71% and showed a significant rising trend with age. There was no morality. Assessment of water supply, sanitary conditions of cook houses and disposal system of night soil could not provide any clue to the source of infection. Subsequently, all the food handlers were subjected to rectal swab examination. Two of them, working in the same messes from where cases had occurred, were found positive for Vibrio cholerae (0-1, Eltor, Ogawa). Immediate control measures by way of isolation and treatment of carriers promptly abated the outbreak. Role of carriers in outbreak of cholera has been highlighted.","1446":"The overall prevalence of dental caries was found to be 57.47 percent in an urban slum irrespective of sex, with a maximum of 75.88 percent in the age group of 5-9 years. Habit of taking hard and sticky food, bad oral hygiene were some of the important epidemiological correlates. Fluoride content of drinking water did not show any significant role.","1447":"A review of history sheets of obstetric cases recorded in a district hospital in 1992 was done to compare the obstetric outcome in 200 teenage first pregnancies (Study group) with that in Control group i.e. 20 years to 29 years. It revealed that incidence of complications of pregnancy like anaemia, pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preterm labour were significantly higher among teenage mothers. The normal mode of delivery was commoner in teenagers (82.5%) in comparison to control group (76.5%), probably because of higher number of low birth weight babies. The fetal outcome was significantly worse in teenage mothers with high incidence of perinatal mortality (8%) and low birth weight babies (35%). There was not a single newborn with birthweight above 3500 gms, in teenage group, whereas, control group had 5 babies (2.5%) in the category.","1448":"Earlier study reported that about 1% of general population or urban Manipur was injecting drug users (IDUs). A study was conducted to observe the IDU prevalence in rural Manipur and the role of national highway (NH) in determining the IDU prevalence if any. It was also aimed to study the HIV prevalence among IDUs of different villages. Villages were startified in to 3 categories based on distance and communication facilities from the national highway, which cuts across the villages to the neighboring state, Nagaland. Villages close to NH had the highest IDU prevalence of 1.3% and remote villages had the least prevalence of 0.2% whereas villages in between the above mentioned two groups had a prevalence of 0.9%. It was surprisingly observed that HIV was uniformly distributed among the IDUs of all villages and ranged from 50-51%. This indicates that IDU prevalence at distance is predominantly determined by the presence of drug trafficking route\/s like national highway whereas HIV prevalence is mainly determined by the needle sharing behaviour of IDUs. A previous study found a 1% prevalence of injecting drug use among the population of urban Manipur, India.  The present study measured this prevalence in different villages in Manipur and assessed the impact of the National Highway on drug use.  Pure injectable heroin is known to be transported along this highway.  Villages were stratified into three groups on the basis of their proximity to the highway.  The prevalence of injecting drug use was estimated as 1.3% in villages within 2 km of the highway, 0.9% in those located 2-10 km from the highway, and 0.2% in those situated at a distance of more than 10 km from the highway.  The rates of HIV positivity among injecting drug users identified through this study were 50.0%, 51.4%, and 50.0%, respectively.  Most injecting drug users were 25-30 years of age.  Needle sharing was widespread.  48% of identified users expressed a desire to stop drug injection, primarily because of concerns about the associated HIV\/AIDS risk, economic pressures, and loss of social prestige.  AIDS prevention campaigns should be initiated as soon as a geographic connection (e.g., a major highway) to injecting drug use is identified. ","1449":"Most of the old persons staying in rural areas are illiterate with physical disabilities and are psychologically disturbed due to the loss of income and hence they are unable to lead a productive life. The present study was thus undertaken in a rural area of Wardha district, with the objective of studying the sociomedical aspects and psychological perceptions of the elderly population. Out of 10,000 population, 600 individuals of age 60 years and above were studied. Proportion of females was 330 (55%) and males 270 (45%) respectively. 300 (66.5%) of them were illiterate, and majority were agricultural labourer (238, 39.66%) and daily labourers (172, 28.66%). 244 individuals (40.67%) were still the head of the family and rest were related to the head of the family. 91 (15.17%) felt the change in attitude of the family members. 139 (31.5%) felt neglected and 146 (24.33%) loneliness respectively.","1450":"Ratnagiri, a coastal district situated in the western part of Maharashtra, is stratified as 'Non-Problem District' as far as Malaria is concerned based on API, topography, rainfall, vector species, Vulnerability etc. Konkan rail project was launched in 1991 and 6 out of 9 blocks of districts Ratnagiri are penetrated by the rail-line. The local ecology of the district is disturbed on account of the project, which is expected to favor malarial transmission. A study based on secondary data was undertaken with following objectives: To assess various operational indicators under NMEP during 1988-93 in the district with respect to their quantitative and qualitative fulfillment. To assess API in the district during same period in the context of inception of Konkan rail. It disclosed that the operational indicators like SPR, SFR &amp; Pf Percentage showed upward trend since 1991 i.e. the year of inception of the Konkan rail project. With ABER consistently above 10% &amp; concordance of the cross-checking results above 96%, the estimate of API becomes more meaningful. Though API shows upward trend, it was never above 2 during 1988-93. Less number of positive cases were found in Active Surveillance during 1988 to 1993. The contribution of Drug Distribution Centres (DDCs) is almost negligible in the district. In-depth analysis of positive cases revealed that the immigrants suffered more &amp; May to July was the season for malaria transmission in the district during the said period. More people above 15 yrs. and more males were found malaria positive which may be because of more outdoor life of this group. Block wise analysis revealed that Mandanged &amp; Khed Blocks showed API more than 2 since 1992. Paradoxically, Mandangad is a coastal block without rail-line, while Khed block is situated away from seashore but has rail-line. More irrigation, less adequate surveillance because of staff vacancy &amp; nonfunctional Drug Distribution Centres (DDCs), more losses to radical treatment are the probable factors responsible for higher API in Mandangad and Khed blocks as compared with the rest of the blocks from the District Ratnagiri.","1451":"","1452":"One of the principles of primary health care is intersectoral co-ordination. A cross sectional study done at the primary health center revealed existence of unsatisfactory co-ordination between health and education department. According to the 1991 census, more than half of India's population is illiterate.  In this context, education can have an enormous effect upon health.  Efforts need to be taken to incorporate the principles and practice of good health among school-goers at all levels.  106 teachers of mean age 40 years from 52 schools and 21 health staff of mean age 30 years from K. Gollahally, Primary Health Center area, Bangalore urban district, were interviewed to assess their health-related knowledge, attitudes, and practice.  Although 70 (66%) teachers had heard of the Health for All by the Year 2000 slogan, only 32 could satisfactorily explain what the slogan means.  46% of teachers and 50% of health staff were aware of intersectoral coordination (ISC).  All teachers and 90% of health staff favor ISC and believe that education improves health and that health improves education.  All teachers endorse cleanliness at school, general personal hygiene, and the provision of recreational facilities, but only 45% had been taught about such topics.  50% of teachers could satisfactorily explain why children should be immunized, and the majority of teachers believe that a nutritious diet is needed to promote health or for specific protection or both.  Teachers were poorly informed regarding health and although the study participants were aware of the need for ISC, they did not regularly attend primary health care\/school meetings. ","1453":"The present study carried out in Calcutta National Medical College, Calcutta, has revealed problem of missed opportunities of immunisation in children and pregnant women and factors contributing to the problem. The percentage of missed opportunity in children and pregnant woman are 30% and 7% respectively. The major cause in case of children were that all the vaccines are not administered in all the days of week (71.05%) and in pregnant woman were wrong ideas about contraindication (42.86%) and indifferent attitude of the health worker (42.86%). All the missed opportunities were attributed to the health care providers. A missed opportunity for immunization is defined as any visit to a health facility by a child or eligible woman who is partially immunized, not up-to-date with their vaccinations, and free of contraindications to immunization, which does not result in the child or woman receiving all the vaccine doses for which he or she is eligible.  Over the course of 2 months, 100 children aged 0-23 months were surveyed as they were about to leave Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital clinic health facilities which either provide or do not provide vaccinations with the goal of assessing the problem of missed opportunities to immunize children and pregnant women and the contributing factors.  100 pregnant women exiting various health facilities were also interviewed.  The percentages of missed opportunities to immunize children and pregnant women are 30% and 7%, respectively.  71.05% of the reason for missed opportunities was that the appropriate vaccines were not available.  Among pregnant women, 42.86% of failure was due to misperceptions about contraindications and 42.86% because of the indifferent attitudes of health workers.  All missed opportunities were attributed to health care providers. ","1454":"","1455":"Environmental cum medical study was conducted in asbestos cement factory. The environment was evaluated for asbestos fiber by the methods recommended by BIS. Total 355 exposed and 312 suitably matched control workers were investigated by spirometer, Wright's peak flow meter and full sized postero-anterior chest radiograph. The levels of asbestos fiber were 2 to 3 times higher than TLV i.e. 2 f\/ml in pipe cutting dept., crude fiber grinding inlet count was more than the ACGIH recommended limit i.e. 5 mpccf of air in pipe cutting dept. and silica mill. In the rest of the department, fiber level as well as dust particle count were below prescribed limit. The comparison of mean values of PFT parameters of workers with 16-20 years exposure history with control one was showing statistically significant decline in mean values of FVC only suggesting restrictive type of PFT impairment in this group of workers. But in workers with more than 20 years exposure, the mean values of all the parameters studied were reduced as compared to control one suggesting combined type of PFT impairment. When the mean values of PFT parameters of exposed smokers were compared with exposed non-smokers there was statistically no significant difference. This can be due to marginal contribution of smoking habit in impairment of PFT parameters of exposed smokers. The percentages of workers with parenchymal and pleural changes due to asbestos exposure were nearly two times more in more than 20 years exposure groups as compared to 11-20 years exposure groups. The parenchymal and pleural changes due to asbestos exposure were more common in exposed smokers as compared exposed non-smokers. However the detailed analysis revealed that if smoking contributes to the development of interstitial fibrosis, the contribution is a marginal one in comparison to the effect of asbestos dust exposure.","1456":"It is well felt that community participation, local planning, development of self reliance and manpower resource within the community itself can strengthen the effort of disaster preparedness and response. The present study was intended to bring out the salient features about perception and opinion of community leaders and community members about existing preparedness programme and appropriateness of mitigatory exercise against flood disaster in four eastern states of India viz.

Body Mass Index (BMI), an age-independent index was used to grade the nutritional status according to which, 36.7% of the boys were found to be malnourished. Signs of specific nutritional deficiencies were observed in 13.5% of the boys. Morbidity in some form or the other was present in 148 (60%) boys. Skin disease was the commonest morbidity (31.7%), followed by diseases of the oral cavity (16.1%), acute respiratory infections (8.6%) and diseases of the ear (9.9%). Need for health promotional activities is stressed to reduce the morbidity and improve the health status of these children. The government of India is responsible for caring for India's destitute children.  Findings are reported from the July 1992 study of nutritional status and morbidity among 192 boys aged 6-12 years living in a Children Observation Home in North West Delhi.  The facility is run by the state's Department of Social Welfare and is comprised of classrooms, a dining room, a kitchen, a medical care unit, and a playground.  The children sleep in dormitories and each child is entitled to a balanced diet of cereals, pulses, and vegetables.  Welfare officers and attendants are employed to care for the children.  In reality, the facilities tend to be inadequate and unhygienic.  Using body mass index (BMI) to grade the boys' nutritional status, 36.7% were found to be malnourished, 16.7% severely.  Signs of specific nutritional deficiencies were seen in 13.5% and some type of morbidity was observed in 60%.  Skin disease was the most common morbidity, with 31.7% afflicted, followed by diseases of the oral cavity (16.1%), acute respiratory infections (8.6%), and diseases of the ear (9.9%).

The tribal mothers of 462 children in the age group of 0-24 months were interviewed for breast-feeding practices. 69.69% of the children received their first breast feed after 24 hrs. of birth, however none of the children was breast fed within 2 hrs. of birth. The exclusive breast-feeding rate was 0.22 and the predominant breast-feeding rate was 0.79. Timely complementary feeding rate was 0.22. The continued breast-feeding rates at 1 year and 2 years were 0.88 and 0.64, respectively. The ever breast-fed rate, timely first-suckling rate and exclusive breast-feeding rate were 1.00, 0.00 and 0.22 respectively. The median duration of breast-feeding was 23 months.

Targets for the year 2000 A.D. have been fixed for different programmes. Some programmes are getting more emphasis, perhaps at the cost of others. The study area has already achieved most of the targets set for 2000 A.D. Studying the time utilisation pattern of the workers of these PHCs can give valuable information for planning of working of other PHCs. To study the time utilisation pattern of the staff of the two PHCs run by Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS. The multipurpose workers (MPWs) and the health assistants (HAs) were accompanied by investigators and information collected regarding their utilisation of time in the field. The Medical Officers were asked to maintain a diary from which this information was collected The MPWs spend about 3.3 minutes in each house. Child care (immunisation, Vit. A and folifer distribution) is the main activity being carried out by both male as well as female worker. Other important activities for male worker are: family welfare (18%), malaria work (11%) and collection of vital statistics (10%). For the female worker Antenatal care (25%) and family welfare (20%) were other important activities. For the HAs also child care was an important activity. However for the male HA malaria related work was the most important. The Medical Officer spends about 60% of this time in administrative and supervisory work. Immunisation programme is getting the maximum input from workers, which is reflected in &gt; 90% coverage of all vaccines.

There were significant increase in the average gain monthly weight throughout infancy (P &lt; 0.01) and preponement of age at which weaning started (P &lt; 0.001) in infants born to mothers who registered themselves early during same gestation for antenatal care programme, the same infants being followed in an under-five clinic till one year of age. Though there was hardly any difference in average birth weights of infants of the study and control groups (P &gt; 0.05), antenatal care programme was definitely helpful in promoting their babies for early registration for an under-five clinic (P &lt; 0.001). Birth weight reflects mother's health and nutritional status, and predicts the future growth and development of the child.  Antenatal care visits are important to the timely detection of risks and subsequent treatment.  While an infant grows 300,000-fold inside of the womb, he or she grows by a factor of only 20 from infancy to adulthood.  The authors report their findings from a study conducted to assess the effects of antenatal care given to pregnant women upon infant birth weight and average monthly weight gain during the first year of life.  Findings are based upon 210 singleton babies born in maternity homes and registered latest by 5 months of age for under-5 clinic at Shivajinagar Urban Health Center (UHC), Deonar.  Deonar is a lower socioeconomic status, periurban area of Bombay.  Significant increases were observed in the average monthly weight gain throughout infancy and preponement of age at which weaning started in infants born to mothers who registered themselves early during gestation for antenatal care programs.

Three high schools in an urban area and three in the villages of a district of North India were included in the study. A pretested closed-ended questionnaire was administered to 336 students available. Overall level of knowledge about AIDS was found to be high. However, there were significant differences in knowledge among rural-urban and male-female students. There were some misconceptions in knowledge regarding transmission, prognosis and prevention. Books and media were the most common sources of information. Most of the students wanted to learn more about AIDS. Since overall knowledge levels were high we conclude that AIDS education should concentrate on clarifying areas of misconceptions. To assess current levels of knowledge about AIDS among secondary school students in India, a questionnaire was administered to 336 ninth and tenth graders (mean age, 15 years) in three rural and three urban schools in Haryana State's Ambala District in 1993.  A brief paragraph on HIV\/AIDS is included in textbooks for ninth and tenth graders in Haryana.  85% of students had heard of AIDS; of these, 56% cited sex with an infected partner as a means of HIV transmission and 38% identified use of unsterilized drug-injecting equipment.  Sexual monogamy (49%), condom use (44%), and use of sterilized needles (40%) were the main strategies identified for prevention of HIV transmission.  Of concern was widespread misinformation about HIV transmission and control.  For example, 23% of students believed HIV can be transmitted by drinking from a glass used by an infected person and 22% thought mosquito bites spread the virus.  57% believed persons with AIDS can be detected by their physical appearance and 38% considered AIDS to be a treatable disease.  The most popular sources of knowledge were textbooks (51%), television (50%), and newspapers (34%).  Urban students were significantly more informed about AIDS than their rural counterparts.  Since textbooks are an important source of information in this population, it is recommended that the current paragraph on AIDS be expanded to a separate chapter on AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  In addition, state medical officers are urged to deliver talks on AIDS during routine school health examinations.

Overall incidence of Diarrhoea was 29.1 per thousand persons, and was selectively predominant among under fives (60.2 per thousand). This low incidence of diarrhoea could be attributed to safe drinking water availability and common practice of handwashing by most of the people. But unsafe storage of drinking water at household level (70.5%) and peridomestic open air defaecation by children (22.9%) are potential threat for transmission of the disease. The incidence of diarrhea was assessed in a survey conducted among 6285 persons living in 1090 households in 3 Jhuggi clusters in Delhi, India.  The survey revealed an overall incidence of diarrhea in the 2 weeks preceding the interview of 29.1\/1000.  This rate was higher among children under 5 years of age (60.2\/1000) than among adults (13.8\/1000).  Dysentery was present in 13.1% of cases.  Drinking water sources identified by respondents were community tap (53.0%), municipal water tankers (34.4%), and hand pumps (12.6%).  Water was stored in open buckets kept on the floor without a ladle to draw it in 70.5% of households.  68.9% of adults were using public latrines and 22.9% defecated in open fields.  Only 20.8% of children used latrines, however.  Hand washing after defecation was practiced by 96.2%, while 76.5% washed their hands before meals.  Although this survey documented substantial improvements in sources of water supply and hand-washing practices, the unsafe household storage of water and defecation by children in fields and drains remain problematic.

Out of all deaths, more than 50% occurred after delivery of a child. Besides, the study indicates poor trend in following antenatal care and family planning among maternal mortality cases. Recommendations are made for detailed wide scale study to generate policy issues on the subject. To develop reliable measures of the rate and causes of maternal mortality in south-west Ethiopia, a cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted in Jimma town.  During the 5-year study period (September 1986-August 1990), 100 deaths occurred among women 15-49 years of age in the 5832 households from 10 kebeles included in the study.  15 of these deaths were maternal mortalities, for a rate of 4.02\/100 live births.  The causes of these deaths were sepsis (7 cases), eclampsia (3 cases), abortion (3 cases), and uterine rupture (2 cases).  Eight maternal deaths occurred after delivery.  Although 13 deaths took place in a health center or hospital, 8 of the 15 women received no antenatal care and 12 were not family planning acceptors.

The study revealed that on an average a child suffered from 5.9 episodes of ARI in one year period. Children who were undernourished or showed signs of vitamin A deficiency had significantly greater risk of AIR attacks. Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children under age 5 years.  Host factors such as undernutrition and vitamin A deficiency appear to play a dominant role in the incidence of ARI.  The authors followed fortnightly a sample of 200 randomly selected under-fives for the calendar year January-December 1991 to determine the influence of undernutrition and vitamin A deficiency upon the incidence of ARI.  The children collectively experienced 1172 episodes during the course of the year for an average 5.9 episodes of ARI each.  Each ARI episode lasted for a mean period of 7.2 days.  Children who were undernourished or showed signs of vitamin A deficiency were at significantly greater risk of ARI attacks. ","1486":"In the present study, attempt has been made to study the spectrum of the iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) in a sub Himalayan hyperendemic area. Iodine deficiency has been found to enhance the conditions like abortion, still birth, higher infant mortality, neonatal chemical hypothyroidism, congenital anomalies, retarded growth, hypothyroidism, endemic goitre and endemic cretinism. Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) affects approximately 200 million people worldwide.  An estimated 150 million people in India are at risk of IDD.  The authors studied the full spectrum of IDD in the Colonelganj community development block of Gonda district, an area in which the prevalence of goiter has been reported to be 60-80%.  Findings are based upon interview and clinical examination findings for 500 subjects contacted in a door-to-door survey.  Data were confirmed with auxiliary nurse midwife and primary health center records.  IDD was found to enhance conditions such as abortion, still birth, infant mortality, neonatal chemical hyponyroidism, congenital anomalies, retarded growth, hypothyroidism, endemic goiter, and endemic cretinism. ","1487":"A study was carried out in a slum area of South Calcutta to assess the impact of the current mass education programme against AIDS. Two hundred and six residents, mainly of lower middle class, aged 18-60 years of both sexes were selected at random. They were interviewed to know their perception and sources of information about AIDS. Two-third of them had their own TV and radio, which they watched\/heard for about three and half hours each day. Another 28% watched TV outside for about one and half hours a day. About 46% were daily readers and 20% occasional readers of newspapers. Fifty nine percent knew about persons vulnerable to get AIDS, but most of them associated it to promiscuity only. Avoiding it was the main means known to them for preventing AIDS. The role of condom in it was known to only 2.5% residents. The source of their knowledge was mainly TV, either alone or with other mass media (67%). Such knowledge was related to higher education. To make perception about AIDS more effective, it is suggested that local health and voluntary agencies should involve the community in the AIDS education programme along with the back-up of mass media. An apex agency solely responsible for AIDS education should be set up for each big city to co-ordinate the activities of local agencies. 206 mainly poor and lower middle-class residents of the Chetla slum of South Calcutta were interviewed with regard to their perceptions and sources of information about AIDS.  The goal was to assess the impact of the current mass education program against AIDS.  One member was randomly selected from each of 206 families to participate in the study.  Respondents were aged 16-80 years, of mean age 35-42 years, 43.7% male, 80% married, 19% illiterate, and 94% Hindu.  66% had their own television and radio which they watched\/heard for approximately 3.5 hours daily.  Another 28% watched television outside for approximately 1.5 hours each day.  Approximately 46% and 20% were daily and occasional newspaper readers, respectively.  59% knew about people vulnerable to contracting AIDS, but most associated HIV risk only with promiscuity and prostitution.  Avoiding such behavior was deemed to be the best way to avoid contracting HIV.  Only 2.5% knew that condom use can protect against HIV infection.  The source of that knowledge was mainly television, either alone or with other mass media.  Such knowledge was related to higher education.  The authors suggest that local health and voluntary agencies involve the community in the AIDS education program, backed up by the mass media.  An agency solely responsible for AIDS education should be established in each major city to coordinate local agency activities. ","1488":"","1489":"","1490":"Iodine deficiency disorders are prevalent in all the States and Union Territories in India. Under the National Iodine Deficiency Disorders control programme, the Government of India has adopted a strategy to iodisation of all edible salt in the country which is a long term and sustainable preventive solution to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders. The benefits to be derived from universal salt iodisation are more to the population. Iodised salt is safe and does not cause any side effect. In India, about 167 million people are at risk of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD).  54 million have a goiter, 2.2 million have cretinism, and 6.6 million have mild neurological disorders.  Iodization of all edible salt in India is expected to be achieved by 1996.  A safe daily intake of iodine is between 50 mcg and 1000 mcg.  Yet, in India, daily iodine intake may be as low as 100-160 mcg\/day compared to 3000 mcg\/day in Japan.  Since iodine is concentrated in the top soil and the environment continues to be degraded, supplementary dietary iodine is needed.  In areas endemic to goiter, the iodine content of drinking water is 3-16 mcg\/l, while it is 5-64 mcg\/l in nonendemic areas.  Regardless of food type, iodine content was higher in nonendemic areas than in areas endemic to goiter (e.g., lentils: 13 vs. 4 mcg\/1000g).  Iodine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed rapidly throughout the body.  The thyroid takes up about 30% of the iodine entering the body for hormone synthesis.  The kidneys excrete the rest.  The iodine content of regional diets in India ranges from 170-300 mcg\/day.  The loss of iodine in cooking practices ranges from 30-70%.  The National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) aims to eliminate IDD by the year 2000.  The Food Adulteration Act states that iodized salt at the manufacturing level should have no less than 30 ppm and at the consumer level no less than 15 ppm.  One of the greatest obstacles to NICCDP is poor iodine stability.  Appropriate technologies now produce iodized salt with a long shelf life in some factories in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat.  An important component of NIDDCP is monitoring of iodized salt.  Susceptible people and people with pre-existing abnormalities of the thyroid gland may have adverse effects of excess iodine intake.  It appears that iodine rarely causes an allergic reaction.  The lethal dose low (LDLO) for potassium iodate may be 531 mg\/kg of body weight.  Thus, 32 g is the LDLO for an Indian of average body weight of 60 kg.  A review of case reports show that iodine intake of less than 1000 mcg\/day is safe for most people. ","1491":"","1492":"","1493":"Iodine Deficiency Disorders are one of the biggest worldwide public health problem of today. Their effect is hidden and profound affecting the quality of human life. An attempt has been made to describe the various aspects of the National Iodine Deficiency Disorders control Programme (NIDDCP) being implemented in the country. The paper also focuses about the problems associated in implementing this national programme. In India, 167 million people are at risk of iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs).  54.4 million people have a goiter.  About 8.8 million people have IDD-related mental\/motor handicaps.  IDD is a problem in every state and union territory.  It is a major public health problem in 211 of the 245 districts surveyed.  Even though IDDs cannot be cured, they can be easily prevented.  Daily consumption of iodized\/iodated salt is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent IDD.  In 1962, the government of India implemented the National Goitre Control Programme, now called the National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP).  In 1982, the government made a policy decision to iodate all edible salt in India by 1992.  During 1994-1995, India's private sector produced 34 lakh metric tons of iodated salt per year.  The government expects iodated salt production to increase to 50 lakh metric tons in the near future.  Iodated salt is transported on the railways under a priority category that is second only to defense.  In 19 states and 6 union territories, the sale of noniodated salt has been completely banned.  The remaining state governments have been urged to ban the sale of noniodated salt and to include iodated salt under the public distribution system.  Each State Health Directorate has been advised to set up an IDD Control Cell.  The biochemistry division of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases has a national reference laboratory for monitoring of IDD, and it also trains medical and paramedical personnel.  District health officers in all endemic states have test kits to conduct on-the-spot qualitative testing to ensure quality control of iodated salt at the consumption level.  NIDDCP provides IDD surveys, health education, and publicity campaigns.  Its information, education, and campaign activities include video films, posters, and radio\/TV spots. ","1494":"Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) are widely prevalent in our country and their consequences for human development are well known. The scope of National Goitre Control Programme (NGCP) launched in 1962 was expanded and the programme was renamed as National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) to connote wider implications of iodine deficiency in population. It is necessary to monitor the progress of NIDDCP using quantifiable indicators to ensure achievement of programme objectives. Prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders, status of iodised salt and level of knowledge. Attitude &amp; practice (KAP) of community regarding IDD and iodised salt are a few such indicators. Children in the age group of 8-10 years are considered most appropriate target group to monitor IDD prevalence. The quality of iodised salt assessed at various levels in West Bengal (using field testing kit) indicated 'satisfactory' iodine content (i.e. &gt; or = 15 ppm) at wholesalers (84.3 per cent), retailers (74.3 per cent) and consumers (71.2 per cent) level. It is suggested that the quality of iodised salt should be periodically assessed and intensive educational campaigns on IDD be launched to create increased demand for consumption of iodised salt in the community. In India, the goal of the National Iodine Deficiency Disorder Control Programme (NIDDCP) is elimination of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) by 2000.  It aims to supply iodized salt to all of India and to assess the impact of the supply of iodized salt.  Quantifiable indicators used to monitor its progress include the prevalence of IDD, iodine content of salt, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding iodized salt.  The program targets school children 8-10 years old for assessing IDD prevalence.  It prefers the community-based survey to the school-based survey, since the former includes children not enrolled in school.  The indicators health workers use to assess IDD prevalence are thyroid size (palpation and ultrasonography), urinary iodine, and level of thyroid-stimulating hormones in serum.  Spot testing kits and iodometric titration method are used to measure iodine content in salt.  Salt with at least 15 ppm iodine is classified as satisfactory.  A goiter survey requires a minimum of 5 salt samples (about 20 g).  The KAP survey needs a minimum of 5 different households in each cluster site.  Issues related to salt addressed in the KAP survey include existence of iodized salt, importance of iodized salt consumption, consequences of IDD (e.g., poor physical and mental growth of children, still births, cretinism), packaging of iodized salt, price, storage of iodized salt, use of bagara salt, prior washing of salt, and source of iodized salt.  In West Bengal, only iodized salt can be sold.  In 1994, West Bengal met its annual requirement of edible salt.  A survey at rake unloading points in West Bengal in 1994 revealed that most salt from Gujarat had adequate iodine levels, while all but 5.3% of the salt from Rajasthan had insufficient iodine levels.  Health workers and food inspectors in West Bengal routinely monitor different districts at various levels (household, retailers, and wholesalers).  In 1995, 84.3% of samples at wholesalers, 74.3% at retailers, and 71.2% at households had satisfactory levels of iodine.  The Goitre Cell of the West Bengal government has an IDD educational program involving teachers and panchayats. ","1495":"During 1992-1993 in India, a UNICEF-supported survey was conducted in Dibrugarh District of Assam State to determine the prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), especially goiter.  The prevalence of goiter remained high (42.2%) in Dibrugarh District (65.8% in 1989).  46.95% of all iodated salts had less than the optimum level of iodine (15-29.99 ppm).  Storage practices affected the iodine content of the salt.  For example, within a month and a half, the iodine content of salt stored in earthenware pots is reduced to about 25%.  82.4% of all women 14-45 years old did not perceive goiter as a disease.  98.13% did not know that iodized salt was available in their neighborhood.  Yet, the sale of non-iodized salt has been banned in Assam since 1989.  An in-depth study was conducted in Sonitpur and Tinsukia districts to determine whether raw salt was imported from the west coast (e.g., Gujarat) to Assam.  Transport of iodized salt in remote areas (e.g., Sadia and Lido) took a long time in Tinsukia and storage in earthenware pots, resulting in deterioration of the quality of salt.  Salt is transported to Assam in open wagons, which exposes the salt to the sun and the rains.  Wholesalers store salt in thick polythene bags which are in turn kept in covered godowns.  Retailers sell the salt from open verandas, which exposes the salt to rain and sun.  Household storage practices include plastic or glass jars with or without a cover (80.89% and 12.15%, respectively), gourd shells (1.5%), bamboo containers (2.05%), and earthenware pots (3.41%).  The quality of iodized salt sold by fraudulent traders was much lower than that sold by reputed firms.  The government of India's IDD program monitors the quality of iodized salt.  It provides feedback to the state government.  Monitoring should be a systematic and continuous process.  Assam's government has set up its own monitoring program, focusing on the household level (salt samples: 64.8%).  During 1993-1994, 79.7% of salt samples had a satisfactory level of iodine and 2.7% had no iodine at all.","1496":"","1497":"A baseline evaluation of the quality of STD case management was conducted in five areas of Madras city in 1992, using HIV prevention indicators recommended by the World Health Organization. Eighty-four interviews and 108 observations of private and public clinic practitioners were conducted. Sixty-one percent of interviewed doctors reported making only specific \"clinical\" diagnoses and 17% reported making only the WHO recommended syndrome-based diagnoses while 22% reported making both types of diagnosis. The adequacy of treatment was compared against various standards, including the Indian National Guidelines for STD management. Almost half of the health care providers (HCP) reported using a treatment effective against the two main pathogens that may cause male urethritis, while 20% reported using a treatment that was not effective against either. For male ulcers only 12% of HCPs reported using treatment effective against both syphilis and chancroid. Seventy-nine percent of the HCP reported that they advised their patients to use condoms, but in 30% only of observed consultations, condoms were promoted for STD or HIV\/AIDS prevention. As information concerning the relative prevalence of pathogens in different areas is unlikely to be available, there is an urgent need for the syndromic approach to STD treatment be adopted by health care providers. During November-December 1992, in Madras, India, interviews were conducted with 84 public and private physicians who treated at least five sexually transmitted disease (STD) patients each week in Royapuram, Washerman, Evr High Road, T. Nagar, and Adyar regions of the city.  Field workers also observed 108 medical consultations of 48 of the physicians interviewed.  Researchers aimed to use the findings of this baseline survey to optimize STD services in order to reduce the population at risk of HIV\/AIDS.  61% of the physicians interviewed made specific clinical diagnoses.  17% made only syndrome-based diagnoses.  22% used both types of diagnoses.  48% used a treatment effective against the two main pathogens for male urethritis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis.  20% used a treatment that was not effective against either of these pathogens.  Only 12% used a treatment effective against chancroid and syphilis for men with genital ulcers.  29% did not use a treatment effective against chancroid or syphilis.  For female genital ulcers, only 10.7% of physicians used an effective treatment against chancroid or syphilis.  21.4% provided treatment effective against neither chancroid nor syphilis in female STD patients with genital ulcers.  79% claimed to counsel their STD patients to use condoms, but only 30% were observed actually promoting condoms for STD or HIV\/AIDS prevention.  Physicians instructed only 6% of STD patients how to use condoms.  Condoms were given to only one STD patient.  These findings highlight the need for physicians and other health care providers to adopt the syndromic approach to STD treatment and for developing and evaluating innovative and effective programs of patient education in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection. ","1498":"In India, a steep increase in the prevalence of HIV (0% to 50% within six months) among the IDUs has been reported in Manipur, a north eastern state in 1990. In spite of large scale intervention program like educational campaign and widespread voluntary HIV testing in this state, the infection has quickly spread to the heterosexual population at large. The determinants of risk taking behaviors like sharing of unclean needle among the IDU population has been explored in this paper. A cross sectional study has been carried out among all of the 488 IDUs who attended any detoxification centers and prison during last two years at Imphal, the capital city of this state. Self reported behaviors based on the pre-scheduled interview were recorded and participation rate was satisfactory. The data was compared to a similar survey carried out by us in 1990. Although there has been decline in risk behavior among the IDUs, a logistic regression analysis reveals that unsafe needle sharing behavior is not influenced by the knowledge on HIV transmission, educational status or history of HIV testing or serostatus of the individual. The limitation of cross sectional nature of the study, bias due to collection of data in prison, self reported behavior, possible differences with street samples of the addict are discussed. During August 1991 to July 1993, in Manipur State, India, social workers interviewed 488 intravenous drug users (IDUs) who were drug-free for at least 7 days and who had been institutionalized within the previous 6 months in 1 of 9 detoxification centers (the largest being the Manipur Central Jail) in Imphal city.  They aimed to examine the extent of risky injecting behavior, determinants of safer injecting behavior, and any change in risky behavior since 1990.  The research team provided HIV counseling after the interview.  This counseling was in addition to routine counseling provided by the centers.  Almost all (99%) subjects were male.  The median age was 26 years.  IDUs in this study were less likely to currently share needles than in 1990 (70% vs. 96%; p  0.01).  IDUs in 1993 were less likely to report never cleaning needles than in 1990 (10% vs. 62%; p  0.01).  Nevertheless, only 69% knew specifically the protective role of any type of cleaning.  No IDU knew about the use of bleach to clean needles.  The HIV prevalence rate among IDUs has increased from 56% to 80%.  IDUs in 1993 were more likely to know that HIV is transmitted via sexual intercourse and by needle sharing than in 1990 (95% vs. 70% and 93% vs. 75%, respectively; p  0.01).  About 70% of all IDUs in 1993 had undergone HIV testing.  Knowing one's HIV status did not influence needle sharing (69.4% vs. 71% for not knowing).  Knowledge of HIV transmission, educational status, or history of HIV testing or HIV status influenced unsafe needle sharing practices.  When the researchers controlled for education, ethnicity, duration of drug use, and awareness about their HIV test result, only age less than 30 years was associated with sharing of unclean needles (83.4% vs. 16.6% for 30-44 year olds; odds ratio = 2.2; p = 0.0016).  These findings suggest urgent and appropriate intervention in this high-risk group. ","1499":"It is estimated that as of the end of 1994 approximately 1,750,000 adults were infected with HIV in India. This estimate is based upon a review of data provided by the National AIDS Control Organization. The methods to reach such estimate are succinctly reviewed and a series of scenarios presented. During 1985-95, in India, 17,830 blood samples out of 2,460,075 samples screened for HIV antibodies tested and were confirmed positive for HIV for a seropositivity rate of 7.25\/1000.  Using this rate, the estimated number of HIV positive adults in all of India as of the end of 1994 was 3,254,685.  Another way to estimate the number of HIV infected adults in India is determining the number of such adults in each state and adding them.  Seropositivity rates were available from states with 99.2% of the adult population.  This method yields an estimated 2,524,628 HIV infected adults as of the end of 1994.  Another method assumes that testing has been confined to urban areas and that most HIV infections occur in these areas.  This method yields 914,708 HIV infected adults.  A modification of this method uses the urban population of each state and the state specific seropositivity rate to obtain a national estimate.  It finds the 1994 estimate of HIV infected adults to be 839,693.  A state specific urban estimate added to a state specific rural estimate yields a weighted state specific estimate.  Assuming a rural estimate of 10% of the state specific estimate, all the weighted state specific estimates add up to 1,008,186 HIV infected adults as of the end of 1994.  Since a 10-year prevalence estimate leads to an underestimate of current prevalence and the unrepresentative nature of HIV testing tends to produce an artificially high estimate when applied to the whole population, researchers used preliminary data from the March 1994 round of sentinel surveillance to obtain an estimate of the HIV infected adults.  They assumed a 1% HIV seroprevalence rate for both pregnant women and sexually transmitted disease clients combined and a 0.1% rate for the adult rural population .  They then estimated the number to be 1,583,000 adult HIV infections (1,260,000 urban infections + 323,000 rural infections).  They then added HIV infected sex workers and injecting drug users to achieve a national estimate of 1,758,000 infected adults.

Out of 16 sero-positive serum samples, 5 (31.25%) was positive for HIV-2 only. It is, therefore, suggested that all kits employed for initial serotesting must include both HIV-1 and HIV-2.","1504":"This study was conducted to know whether prisoners constitute a \"high risk group\" for HIV transmission in India today. A sero-epidemiological period prevalence survey was conducted in Central Prison, Bangalore, South India covering 1007 undertrials and 107 permanent convicts during January to December 1993. Twenty (1.98%) undertrials and none of the permanent convicts were seropositive for HIV infection. All of them were males and 1.6(80%) of them were in the age group of 20-30 years. Low literacy, poor income, sexual promiscuity and low condom usage were observed among the seropositives. Thus, prisoners constitute a high risk group and routine screening and counselling are recommended. Throughout 1993, health workers took blood samples from 1007 prisoners awaiting trial and 107 convicted inmates in the Central Prison in Bangalore, India, for HIV-1 screening.  All these prisoners were male and underwent pretest counseling.  20 (1.98%) prisoners awaiting trial and none of the permanent convicts tested positive for HIV-1 antibodies.  Only 13 underwent post-test counseling.  Many prisoners initially denied the possibility of being HIV positive.  Many suffered psychologically, breaking down or becoming depressed.  The HIV-1 positive prisoners tended to be illiterate (53%), poor (69%), and married (61%) and their job involved traveling (61%).  All reported having had many casual sexual relationships, particularly in brothels and cheap hotels.  Some prisoners had these relationships outside of Bangalore.  23% of the HIV-1 positive prisoners had had sexual intercourse with 50-60 women.  69% did not use condoms.  39% had used urine and\/or soda water to wash their genitals after sexual intercourse.  No one had used intravenous drugs.  No one had had a blood transfusion.  30% had tatoos.  50% of the HIV-1 positive prisoners had lost weight.  15% had diarrhea, weight loss, and persistent glandular lymphadenopathy.  All had used pyoderma antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and gentamicin).  90% knew nothing about HIV\/AIDS.  13 of the 20 prisoners were released from the prison and lost to follow-up.  Since prisoners are easily accessible and there is a steady flow of prisoners awaiting trial, it is important to routinely screen them, conduct contact tracing, and do follow-up action to prevent further HIV-1 transmission in the community.  Similar surveys should be conducted in other prisons nationwide. ","1505":"In India, clinicians conducted a cross sectional analysis of 104 HIV-positive intravenous (IV) drug users registered at the ICMR Unit for Research on AIDS in northeastern states of India to examine home-based care of these individuals living in Imphal, Manipur.  10% required referral to a hospital, mainly due to meningitis.  26% were asymptomatic.  Tuberculosis (TB) was the most common opportunistic infection (12.5% for pulmonary TB and 6.7% for extrapulmonary TB).  Other frequent signs and symptoms were oropharyngeal candidiasis (9.6%), hepatic involvement (9.6%), diarrhea (9.6%), and non-tubercular chest infection (8.7%).  Among all 340 IV drug users registered at the unit, 17.1% were referred to either a hospital or an institution.  Only 37.9% of those referred were satisfied with institutionalized care.  The family extended support in 99.1% of all 340 cases.  25% of the families received counseling support.  These findings suggest that families could care for most of the patients in their homes.  Since the burden of caring for AIDS patients on the health care delivery system is expected to increase, a home-based care model and an improved referral network are needed.","1506":"Nursing students are being identified as a potential risk group for the AIDS spread. Awareness regarding AIDS in this group is crucial for AIDS management and prevention. This cross-sectional study was planned and carried out to assess the awareness of nursing students regarding AIDS and to identify the areas of confusion that might serve as an important target of educational intervention. The study consisted of 204 nursing students selected from Nursing school, Govt. Medical College, Nagpur. The overall knowledge regarding etiology, risk factors, transmission, treatment and prevention of AIDS was confusing among the students. The average knowledge score was estimated to be 17.6 of 28. However, more knowledge was found to be correlated with more positive and fearless attitude towards AIDS patients. In 1994, in India, interviews were conducted with 204 nursing students (202 females and 2 males) at the Government Medical College in Nagpur so researchers could determine their knowledge of and attitudes towards AIDS.  31.9% thought that AIDS is not at all serious and is just like having the common cold.  Only 42.2% thought that everyone is susceptible to AIDS.  70% knew that AIDS involves loss of immunity and eventually opportunistic infections.  25% still did not know the cause of AIDS.  69% believed correctly that HIV causes AIDS.  Most nursing students knew that sexual intercourse with an AIDS patient and mother-to-infant transmission (63.7% and 88.2%, respectively) are two modes of HIV transmission.  61.8% knew that condom use prevents AIDS.  35.8% incorrectly believed that there is an AIDS vaccine.  93% feared acquiring HIV\/AIDS through their work.  34.3% did not want to care for AIDS patients.  Out of a total of 28, the average number of correct responses score was 17.  Only 11% of nursing students had a knowledge score of at least 75%.  35% did not think AIDS is a problem in India.  A more positive and fearless attitude towards caring for AIDS patients among nursing students was associated with a higher knowledge score than those lacking this attitude. ","1507":"In India, a health education professor conducted a survey of 400 health care professionals at the medical college and hospital in Calcutta, West Bengal, to examine their level of awareness about HIV\/AIDS.  The health care professionals included surgeons, gynecologists, pathologists, internal medicine specialists, blood bank workers, recent medical school graduates, clinical students, preclinical students, nurses, and technologists.  40-60% of preclinical students knew little about the natural history of HIV infection and its clinical manifestations.  An absence of HIV\/AIDS education in the undergraduate medical curriculum and no exposure to causes and clinical training in HIV\/AIDS may account for this low knowledge level.  20% of students and 40% of physicians knew that there were HIV tests available.  50-60% of paramedical personnel had misconceptions about HIV\/AIDS, particularly about utensils, sharing toilets, and bites of mosquitoes and bedbugs.  80-90% of all health personnel had knowledge levels about proper decontamination and precautionary measures against exposure to contaminated blood and body fluids.  Preclinical students had the highest mean knowledge score.  66-80% of all health professionals were not satisfied with their current knowledge level on HIV\/AIDS.  This same proportion thought that they would benefit from HIV\/AIDS education and training.

Community based studies are therefore useful to understand effect of these factors for future planning. The present study was therefore undertaken in Burdwan district of West Bengal with the objectives of studying level of intelligence of children of 3 to 6 years age group and impact of the factors related to the level of intelligence of these children. 72 children of 3 to 6 years age group were studied, of which 2\/3 were either normal or having Grade-I undernutrition and the rest were either Grade-II or Grade-III. A significant positive association was found between DST IQ score (Bharat Raj) and the nutritional grade. Non-formal education also was found to have significant bearing on the IQ level. No significant relationship was however found between DST IQ score and the religion indicating culture independence of the scoring system. During January-December 1991 in India, door-to-door visits were made at 59 households with at least one child 3-6 years old in the field practice area of Burdwan Medical College in West Bengal. The researchers wanted to examine the intelligence level of the children and the effect on their intelligence of associated factors such as nutrition, socioeconomic status, and environment. There were 72 children 3-6 years old. Mean family size was 6.9. The houses were in poor condition. 47.5% of families defecated in open fields. 36.11% of the children had either grade II or grade III malnutrition. 66.7% of the children had a Developmental Screening Test (DST) IQ score within the normal range (85-115). 30.6% had borderline scores (68-84). Two children were mildly retarded (52-67). Neither religion nor socioeconomic status influenced the IQ level. The proportion of normal IQ children who have had nonformal schooling was much greater than that of normal IQ children who have not had nonformal schooling (88.6% vs. 45.9%; p  0.01). Children of normal and grade I nutritional status were more likely to have a normal IQ level than those with grade II or grade III malnutrition (75% and 77.3% vs. 57.1% and 20%, respectively; p  0.05). Nonformal education had a significant independent effect on the IQ level (Z = 3.03; p  0.05), while nutritional status did not have a significant independent effect (Z = 1.39; p  0.05). There was a positive significant association between DST IQ score and sitting height (r = 0.27; p  0.05) and head circumference (r = 0.27; p  0.05).

In this study a comparison of these common anthropometric measurements is done in order to find out the best method suitable for individual assessment of malnutrition. The evaluation technique discussed in this paper consists of comparison of the efficiency of various anthropometric measurements in detecting malnutrition and was judged in terms of specificity, sensitivity and predictive value. The test is most efficient when the sensitivity and specificity attain unity. In this study it is shown that weight for age and Body Mass Index (BMI) attain higher value of delta [delta = 1-(alpha + beta)], where - alpha is false positive value and beta is false negative value) and low value of delta standard error of which proves that the best method of assessing malnutrition using various anthropometric measurements is weight for age as against body mass index. When attempting to improve the nutritional status of infants and children, an appropriate, reliable, and consistent measurement tool is needed.  Anthropometric indices are, however, used indiscriminately when assessing malnutrition in children under five years old, especially when community-based surveys are concerned.  The estimated prevalence of malnutrition therefore varies between methods.  The authors compare common anthropometric measurements in an effort to determine which is the most suitable for the individual assessment of malnutrition.  The efficiencies of anthropometric measurements in detecting malnutrition were compared on the basis of specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value.  The test is most efficient when sensitivity and specificity attain unity.  Weight, height, age, and mid-arm circumference measurements were taken for 163 children aged 5-60 months in a standard manner as recommended by Jelliffe.  The data were extracted from a baseline survey conducted by the Department of Community Medicine, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore.

As viral hepatitis specially hepatitis B is a major public health problem in all parts of the world, this type of study will give an idea about the preponderance of hepatitis infection among hospital admitted patients. Hepatitis B is the most dangerous of hepatitis viruses due to its relationship with fulminant viral hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, and chronic liver diseases, as well as its various modes of person-to-person transmission and increased case fatality rate.  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the surface component of the hepatitis B virus.  Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) tends to be associated with resistance to infection.  HBsAg as well as anti-HBsAg are considered to be specific markers for infection with the virus.  The authors used ELISA commercial kits to test 184 inpatients suffering from various hepatic as well as non-hepatic disorders admitted during 1989 to Kasturba Medical College and Hospital, Manipal, for the presence of HBsAg and anti-HBsAg.  In so doing, researchers hoped to gain insight into the extent of hepatitis infection among hospital admitted patients.  129 patients had hepatic disorders, 12 had nonhepatic disorders, 35 were obstetric cases, and 5 were patients of diverse clinical manifestations.  Cord blood was also tested from 3 newborns.  HBsAg was found to be reactive in 31.5% of cases and anti-HBsAg in 18.5% of cases.  33.33% of the 129 patients with liver disorders were reactive for HBsAg and 17% for anti-HBsAg.

Commonest side reactions reported were fever (36%) and pain at injection site (33%). Contraindications listed by mothers were mild cold (41%), mild fever (24%) or loose stools (14%). Health workers were the major source of information and 76% knew the use and maintenance of immunization cards.","1538":"Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has simplified treatment of diarrheal dehydration. Hospitals in India have diarrheal treatment and training units (DTUs) to help manage the many diarrheal cases. DTU staff keep children for 4-6 hours to correct the dehydration with ORT and feeding. Health personnel undergo training in diarrhea management at DTUs. ORT is the preferred treatment in almost all cases of acute diarrhea. It is not best for diarrheal cases which exhibit shock, profuse vomiting (3 times\/hour), glucose malabsorption, abdominal distension or paralytic ileus, and high rate of purging (15 ml\/kg body weight\/hour). ORT successfully treats 95% cases of infantile diarrhea, even Rotavirus-caused diarrhea. Health workers should begin treating cases of severe dehydration with intravenous (IV) therapy and then administer ORT 3-4 hours later for infants and 1-2 hours later for adults. If IV therapy is not possible, the patient should receive oral rehydration solution (ORS) nasogastrically and then referred to a facility with IV therapy. WHO's ORS formula is safe for newborns and young infants. ORT is appropriate even when diarrheal cases are vomiting. ORT tends to stop vomiting 1-2 hours after initial ORS administration because it corrects acidosis. The glucose in WHO's ORS facilitates absorption of adequate sodium across the intestinal mucous membrane. ORS also restores the loss potassium ions and HCO3\/citrate. If ORS is not available, sugar salt solution can be used. To achieve the optimum concentration, the amount of sucrose has to be twice that of glucose. ORS should be stored in a cool place, be covered, and used for no more than 24 hours. Antiemetics should not be given during ORT. Most diarrheas do not require any antibiotic. Sterile water is not necessary to prepare ORS. Rice gruel, coconut water, and pulse water are home available fluids which can treat dehydration. Breast feeding and regular feeding should continue during diarrheal episodes.","1539":"An analysis of hospital admission records and case histories from 1989 to 1993 and interviews with hospital administrators, physicians, and mothers of hospitalized patients were conducted to examine the benefits of establishing the Diarrhoea Treatment and Training Unit (DTU) in June 1991 at the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Calcutta, India. The case fatality rate of all diarrhea patients fell between 1989 and 1993 from 4.5% to 2.5%. Among patients less than 5 years old, it ranged from 12.7% in 1989 to 2.1% in 1992. The proportion of total cases successfully managed by using oral rehydration therapy (ORT) increased from 37% to 78.9% between 1991 and 1993. In 1989-1990, the hospital used 12,740 and 14,640 units of intravenous (IV) fluids. By 1993, it used only 7200 units of IV fluids. The use of packets of oral rehydration salts increased from 6000 in 1989 to 24,000 in 1993 (23,000 in 1993). Antibiotic use fell considerably (1989-1993, 100-31.5% of cases). The cost of treating each diarrhea patient decreased from Rs.84.50 to Rs.19.10. Before the DTU, the hospital did not allow mothers and other family members to stay with children who had diarrhea. Thus, young children could not be breast fed. Now, mothers stay with the children to administer ORT and to continue breast feeding. DTU staff train mothers in how to administer ORT and to continue it at home, to feed during and after diarrhea, and to recognize danger signs. These findings show that setting up the DTU reduced the case fatality rate of diarrhea patients and the cost of diarrhea treatment. They indicate the need to establish DTUs in major hospitals and ORT corners in all block primary health centers in the state.","1540":"In India, epidemiologists followed 980 rural families with children less than 3 years old living near Calcutta in West Bengal to identify determinants related to maternal behavior and feeding practices of childhood diarrhea.

Children with diarrhea were more likely to live in Kuchcha housing (44.7% vs. 33.9%; p = 0.0006), to have a family income of less than Rs.500\/month (44.2% vs. 36.6%; p = 0.016) and a mother who was illiterate (53.5% vs. 45.4%; p = 0.013). Nondiarrheal families were more likely to have a sanitary latrine (63.9% vs. 50.5%; p = 0.000031) and have soap (for ablution, 22.9% vs. 14.4%; p = 0.0005 and, before food handling, 7.1% vs. 3%; p = 0.0046). Mothers with children who did not have diarrhea were more likely to space their births at least 4 years apart than those with children who did have diarrhea (20.5% vs. 14.7%; p = 0.018). Mothers with children who did not have diarrhea were also less likely to practice poor hygiene. Specifically, they would tend not to use leftover food for the next feeding (19.1% vs. 38%; p = 0.02), to have children whose body and clothes were dirty (19.1% vs. 40%; p = 0.01), to dispose of stools indiscriminately (55.3% vs. 73.7%; p = 0.02), to share a common latrine with other villagers (15.9% vs. 36.2%; p = 0.008), and to stop drinking water in a wide mouth container (66% vs. 84.8%; p = 0.008).

C.S.S.M. programme aims at preventing 70% diarrhoeal deaths, through widespread use of ORT. The present study was carried out to find out the extent of the problem of diarrhoea and utilisation of ORT in three districts of West Bengal. The results showed that the utilisation of ORT was 80.8%, 70.7% and 65% in Howrah, Hooghly and 24-Parganas (South) respectively, during attacks of diarrhoea. The continuing feeding rates were 60.1%, 62.7% and 55.5% in Howrah, Hooghly and 24-Parganas (South) respectively. In the early 1990s, a baseline survey was conducted in 3 districts of West Bengal, India, to determine the magnitude of diarrhea among children less than 5 years old and the rates of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) use and continuing feeding rate. The districts included Howrah, Hooghly, and 24-Parganas (South). Diarrhea prevalence was much lower in Hooghly than in Howrah and 24-Parganas (S) (5.9% vs. 14.2% and 14.5%, respectively; p  0.05). Since the survey was conducted during the non-monsoon season in Hooghly when diarrhea incidence tends to be low, the difference was likely due to seasonal variation. ORT use rates were 80.8% in Howrah, 70.7% in Hooghly, and 65% in 24-Parganas (S) which were much higher than those in Hibar (13%), Orissa (27%), and Assam (10%) in 1987 (p  0.05). Children in Howrah were much more likely to receive WHO recommended ORS than those in Hooghly and 24-Parganas(S) (40.9% vs. 28% and 29.6%, respectively; p  0.05). ORS access rates ranged from 24.9% in 24-Parganas(S) to 36.3% in Howrah, which are lower than the WHO targeted access rate of oral rehydration salts (ORS) (80%). The continuing feeding rates were 60.1% in Howrah, 62.7% in Hooghly, and 55.5% in 24-Parganas (S). The proportion of children who received either less food or no food during a diarrheal episode were still rather high (38.9% in Howrah, 37.3% in Hooghly, and 42.4% in 24-Parganas(S) but lower than those in other Indian districts (57-66%) in 1987.

The training was evaluated after two months and found to be inadequate. The workers were then retrained with modern approach using a module (prepared in local language) as suggested by World Health Organisation. The level of retention of the imparted knowledge of Health Workers for different items 2-3 months after training with lectures and slides ranged between 5-25% except preparation of ORS which was 80%. With the use of modules, 47-98% of health workers could retain the same knowledge 3 months after the training. The knowledge thus acquired were sustained even after 12 months of training to a level which was still much better than that retained 2 months after training with slides and lectures. However some of the items like indication of use of Home Available Fluids, dosage of ORS and when to refer a diarrhoea case to health facility were more difficult to recall after one year. This possibly indicates need for in-service training of grassroot level health workers at suiTable interval. In India, the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases implemented an operations research project on oral rehydration therapy in the rural block of Polba of Hooghly district in West Bengal. Its physicians used lectures and slides to train grassroot level health workers about dehydration signs, management of diarrhea, referral of patients with diarrhea to the Primary Health Center, and how to educate mothers in the community about early management of diarrhea. Each health worker received a reference booklet, prepackaged oral rehydration salts (ORS), and a 1-liter standard plastic container. Two months after the initial training, their knowledge was reevaluated and they underwent retraining. A module in Bengali was used for the retraining. It consisted of individual readings, examples and exercises of simulated conditions, discussions, role playing, and demonstration of ORS preparation. The workers were reevaluated at 3 months and 1 year post-retraining. Other than preparation of ORS (80%), few grassroot workers retained the messages delivered via the lecture and slides approach (5-25%). For example, only 5% could correctly identify the signs of dehydration. On the other hand, many more health workers retained the messages delivered via the modular approach 3 months after retraining (47-98%). At 12 months post-retraining, dosage of ORS, referral, and use of home fluids were more difficult to recall than were signs of dehydration, indication of ORS, and preparation of ORS (18-29% vs. 48-87%). These results show that periodic refresher training increases knowledge to a sustained level. The researchers concluded that simple booklets in local scripts facilitate efficient training of health workers in diarrheal treatment services. Each worker should have his\/her own personal copy. ","1543":"One thousand thirtynine infants, 794 children in their second year of life and 445 children in their third year of life were followed up longitudinally from April 1984 to March 1985. Nearly 6 episodes of diarrhoea per annum, during infancy, 5.49 episodes in second and 4.19 episodes during third year of life respectively, were experienced. On an average, each episode of diarrhoea lasted for four days. 20% of infants, 6.43% of children between 1-2 years and 7.26% of children between 2-3 years, experienced weight loss of 300 gm. or more following episode of diarrhoea. Diarrhoea case fatality rate was 1.8% and 0.75% for infants and children between 1-3 years of age respectively. Home management of diarrhoeas by mothers with the advocacy of anganwadi workers and health workers yielded dividends. Sustained efforts of this kind may go a long way in management of diarrhoeas. In Kathura community development block in Haryana state, India, village level volunteers (Anganwadis) and health teams promoted oral rehydration and continued feeding during diarrheal episodes. Between April 1984 and March 1985, 37 anganwadis followed 2278 children aged 0-3 years and recorded diarrheal episodes and weight to measure the incidence of acute diarrhea among these rural children and to gather baseline information with which they can determine interventions and perform an area specific evaluation. The incidence of diarrhea was greatest among the infants (75.46%), followed by the 1-2 year olds (67.25%) and 2-3 year olds (51%). The average number of diarrheal episodes per child was 2.56 (2.33-2.63).  The number of episodes per year was 5.48 (4.19-5.98). The average duration of diarrheal episodes ranged from 3.87 to 4.16. Thus, the number of days lost due to diarrhea ranged from 16.2 to 23. Infants (0-12 months) were most likely to lose at least 300 g during diarrhea (20% vs. 6.43% for 1-2 years and 7.26% for 2-3 years). They were also less likely to either maintain or gain weight during a diarrheal episode (80% vs. 93.57% and 93.74%, respectively). The overall case fatality rate was 1.27%. It was higher among infants than among 1-3 year olds (1.8% vs. 0.75%). These results suggest that, even though there are still frequent diarrheal episodes during infancy and early childhood, the anganwadis and health teams were rather successful at training most mothers how to manage diarrhea in homes since weight loss and the case fatality rate were minimal. They also indicate that diarrhea surveillance is being integrated into child development services at the village level.

Two districts in Haryana state were selected by using multistage random sampling procedure. Eight hundred eighteen children in the age group of 0-35 months belonging to scheduled caste communities were studied. All children suffering from diarrhoea at the time of survey or within last 2 weeks were included for the detailed study. The occurrence of diarrhoea was highest in age group 6-11 months (28%) and was lowest in age group 0-5 months (16%). No relationship was found between the nutritional status of children and the occurrence of diarrhoea. The percentage prevalence of diarrhoea was 42, 32 and 36 per cent amongst normally, moderately and severely malnourished children, respectively. Thirty seven percent of children suffering from diarrhoea received bottle feed. In 44 rural villages in Faridabad and Hisar districts of Harynana state, India, interviews with mothers of 818 children were conducted to determine the extent of diarrhea among scheduled caste communities. 172 children either had diarrhea at the time of or 2 weeks before the interview. Diarrhea incidence was greatest among the 6-11 month olds, the time when weaning begins and children are given foods and fluids other than breast milk. Incidence was lowest among 0-5 month olds, when many infants are exclusively breast fed. No correlation between nutritional status and diarrhea existed. Children with normal nutritional status were somewhat more likely to have or recently have had diarrhea than moderately and severely malnourished children (42.4% vs. 35.7% and 31.9%, respectively). Weaning practices with the highest proportion of children with an episode of diarrhea were commercial weaning foods (40%) and bottle feeding (36.8%). ","1545":"A study was conducted to find out the pattern of food and fluid practices during diarrhoea among 2,160 children under five. Mothers were educated to give home made fluids during diarrhoea. Their personal hygiene was studied and a positive correlation between diarrhoea and poor personal hygiene was found. After the health education programme, it was observed that mothers started giving home made fluids to the children during diarrhoea but the amount was not increased. Normal feeding was continued only in 38.2% of the episodes. In India, one year after caretakers and indigenous practitioners were educated about causes of diarrhea, dangers of diarrhea, and management of diarrhea with home made fluids (e.g., salt sugar solution and oral rehydration solution [ORS]), field workers interviewed caretakers of and observed 2160 children less than 5 years old in a rural area of Varanasi district to determine existing food practices during a diarrhea episode. Most families (82.4%) obtained their water from wells. There were 2198 diarrhea episodes. The prevalence of diarrhea was 72.2%. Families who kept their water covered had a lower prevalence of diarrhea than those who did not cover their water (84.8% vs. 49.4%; p  0.001). Families who washed utensils with ash had a lower prevalence of diarrhea than those who washed them with mud or both (60.07% vs. 80.02% and 68.1%, respectively; p  0.001). Families who washed their hands with soap before meals suffered diarrhea less often than those who did not (59% vs. 73%; p  0.001). After the health education program, about 82% of mothers breast fed during diarrheal episodes. More mothers gave khichri and rice to children during an episode after the program than before the program (36.4% vs. 18.4% and 18.4% vs. 10.4%, respectively; p  0.001). Even though mothers were more likely to administer fluids after the program than before (e.g., salt sugar solution, 2% vs. 29.6%; p  0.001), they did not necessarily do so often enough (just 23.8% did so 3-4 times\/day). Often, the ingredients for salt sugar solution were not available in the home. Only 38.2% of caretakers continued to give the ill children the usual amount of food during a diarrheal episode. These results indicate a need for the health education program to promote increased fluid intake and continued normal feeding during diarrheal episodes. ","1546":"The review of the current status and implementation of Oral Rehydration Therapy at the community level have been presented in this communication with special emphasis on its development, ORS access rate, ORS use rate and home available fluids. The global ORS supply has gone up an increased eleven folds since 1981. Similarly the ORS access rate has also increase from 46% to 68% in 1991. However, the global ORS use rate was low (21%). The major constraints during ORT implementation which have been reported by several scientists are also discussed. Dehydration is the major reason children die from diarrhea. The key element of the WHO Diarrhoeal Disease Control (CDD) Programme is implementation of oral rehydration therapy (ORT). ORT implementation includes production and distribution of packets of oral rehydration salts (ORS), training of medical and paramedical personnel and education of mothers, and operational\/health services research for identification of suitable strategies for implementation. Most ORT-related research has been done in hospitals. Community health workers in India have been given ORS packets to use to treat diarrhea cases at home. Operational research in India shows that volunteer health guides can train mothers to give available and culturally acceptable home fluids to children with mild diarrhea before dehydration develops. Use of home available fluids greatly reduces the need for ORS packets. Another possible alternative to ORS was sugar salt solution (SSS) or household formula, but research shows that mothers tend to prepare SSS inaccurately. The success of the CDD program depends on ORS production and proper distribution. In India, more than 100 companies produce about 130 different commercial ORS products, indicating a need for quality control. The best indicators to evaluate India's CDD program are ORS access and ORT use rates. In India, the 1991 ORS and ORT use rates were only 7% and 14%, respectively. The approach to ORT in India is mothers should treat children with diarrhea with no dehydration, village level workers should manage dehydrated patients with ORS, and health professionals at the nearest health facility should treat severely dehydrated patients with either ORS or intravenous fluids. ORT has reduced child mortality in India from 1.9% to 0.6%. Major barriers to ORT implementation are scarcity of resources, lack of political commitment, managerial and organizational problems, and problems related to community participation, health personnel, and dissemination of information. ","1547":"Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in infants and children less than 5 years old in developing countries. Diarrheal diseases are a major cause of childhood malnutrition. Toxin-producing bacteria are responsible for many acute diarrheas. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) treats dehydration caused by acute diarrheal episodes. WHO promotes the use of a single oral rehydration formula which contains 3.5 g sodium chloride, 2.5 g sodium bicarbonate or 2.9 g trisodium citrate dihydrate, 1.5 g potassium chloride, and 20 g glucose to 1 liter of water. This ORS formula can safely be used for all age groups and all etiologies of diarrhea. ORS replaces the lost fluid and electrolytes and maintains fluid and electrolytes. Pediatricians in most developed countries do not accept this ORS formula in cases of rotavirus-caused diarrhea because rotavirus blunts some absorptive villi and reduces the activity of lactase and other disaccharidase, resulting in reduced absorption. Yet, the unaffected villus cells may absorb enough water and electrolytes to be effective. In cases of vomiting, ORS should be administered in small amounts and slowly. Some health workers are concerned that 90 mmol\/l sodium in the WHO formula causes hypernatremia in neonates and young infants who have low sodium levels in their stools. Specialists suggest ORS with 30-60 mmol\/l or additional water administered in a 2:1 ratio for these young infants. Hypernatremia is also a concern for malnourished children, but studies show that WHO's ORS is safe and effective in treating malnourished children. Bottle fed children are more vulnerable to hypernatremia than breast fed children. Hypernatremia has neurological effects. Hyponatremia is more common in developing countries than developed countries. It also has neurological effects. In severe dehydration cases, intravenous fluid or ORS delivered via a nasogastric tube should be given immediately.","1548":"","1549":"","1550":"Five types of Escherichia coli are responsible for as much as 25% of all diarrheal diseases in developing countries. They tend to be transmitted via contaminated foods, particularly weaning foods, and water. They include enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroadherent, enteroinvasive, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Shigella species are responsible for 10-15% of acute diarrheas in children less than 5 years old and the most common etiologic agents of childhood dysentery. Shigellosis is common in the warm season. An outbreak of shigella dysentery in West Bengal, India, had a high attack rate in children less than 5 years old and was resistant to many drugs. Nontyphoid Salmonella species cause watery diarrhea with nausea, cramps, and fever. Worldwide, various Salmonella strains exhibit resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole.  Campylobacter jejuni produces watery diarrhea which, in 33% of cases and 1-2 days after onset, contains blood and mucus. Many normal healthy children in developing countries are carriers of C. jejuni. Vibrio cholerae O1 is endemic in parts of Africa and Asia (e.g., 5-10% of hospitalized diarrhea patients). The ElTor cholera biotype is responsible for the 7th pandemic. Other bacterial enteropathogens are Aeromonas species, Bacteroides fragilis, and Providencia alcalifaciens. Rotavirus is a major cause of sporadic and epidemic diarrhea among 6-23 month olds. Its incidence peaks in cold or dry seasons. Other viral enteropathogens are Norwalk virus, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and coronaviruses. In India, the prevalence of Entamoeba histolytica varies from 3.6% to 47.4%. It occurs equally in high and low socioeconomic classes. Giardia lamblia usually infects 1-5 year old children. Its transmission routes are food, water, and the fecal-oral route. Cryptosporidia produce acute watery diarrhea, especially in children less than 2 years old. Cryptosporidia diarrhea is common among AIDS patients. Oral rehydration therapy and proper feeding during and after diarrhea reduces deaths from diarrhea.","1551":"","1552":"","1553":"Before oral rehydration therapy (ORT) was developed, intravenous fluid therapy was the mainstay of fluid therapy for diarrheal dehydration.  The following early observations, however, formed the scientific basis for the discovery of ORT: a group of physiologists observed that glucose enhances the absorption of sodium and water across the intestinal brush-border membrane of experimental animals and that no morphological changes occur in the gut epithelium of cholera patients.  Captain Phillips of the US Army in 1964 first successfully tried oral glucose saline on two cholera patients.  Following this, scientists working at the Cholera Research Laboratory, Dhaka, and the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Calcutta, contributed to the development of modern oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution.  The efficacy of standard ORS was first demonstrated by Pierce et al and others during 1965-69.  During the Bangladesh liberation war, Dr. Dilip Mahalanabis showed the efficacy of ORS in cholera cases among Bangladeshi refugees (1971-72) and Sircar et al in 1978 demonstrated the efficacy of ORS in a cholera epidemic in Manipur.  De et al in 1974 and Chatterjee et al in 1978 convincingly demonstrated the efficacy of ORS in children with diarrhea including cholera.  Based upon this information, the World Health Organization in 1978 launched the global diarrheal diseases control program with ORS at its heart and the short-term objective of reducing mortality due to diarrhea.  The safety and efficacy of WHO-ORS containing 90 mmol\/liter of sodium for neonates was not demonstrated until 1979 at which time Dr. Daniel Pizarrow and colleagues showed the WHO-ORS was effective even for neonates with dehydrating diarrhea and safe if used along with plain water in a 2:1 regimen.  To avoid confusing illiterate mothers in developing countries, Dutta et al and Roy et al in 1984 reported the safety and simplicity of uninterrupted breastfeeding together with breastfeeding.  Further findings were produced on the optimal salt content of ORS for severely malnourished children.  Studies with their corresponding findings have continued since then, with current efforts focused upon developing a treatment for diarrhea using the role of short chain fatty acids in acute watery diarrhea.","1554":"A laboratory trial was carried out at Pune to evaluate the effectiveness of five types of larvicides viz. Malathion, Temephos, Fenthion, Dichlorvos and Fenitrothion against Culex quinquesfasciatus larvae. The expected number of mortality at various dose levels for the five types of insecticides were estimated separately using logistic regression model. Based on the fitted model, the estimated dose level corresponding to the 90 percent mortality (LC90) was obtained for each insecticide. Approximate 95 percent confidence intervals for the LC90 dose, in each case, has been provided. The analysis revealed that out of all the five types of insecticides included in the study, fenthion was the most effective. The estimated value of LC90 in this case was the lowest and is equal to 0.007 mg\/L. The effectiveness of temephos, dichlorvos and fenitrothion was found to be approximately same and malathion was the least effective. The results were found to be comparable with that obtained under probit method.","1555":"Fifty-nine babies were born to eclamptic mothers among 7500 deliveries giving incidence of occurrence of 0.77 percent. The perinatal mortality in eclamptic babies was 32.7%, whereas the total perinatal mortality rate amongst all the deliveries was 10.5%. The mothers were treated within Group I--diazepam, Group II i chlorpromazine (largactil), phenargan and diazepam and Group III--largactil, phethidine and phenargan. The mortality rate was 23.8%, 18.8% and 66.6% respectively. The highest number of still-born i.e. six out of 8 occurred in Group III. Hundred percent still-born was noted in 28-32 weeks of gestation and birth weight less than 1.5 kg irrespective of drug regimes. Iargactil potentiates the respiratory depressant effect of pethidine and may cause high rate of still-birth and death after birth. Between May 1986 and April 1987 in India, 59 infants were born to mothers with eclampsia at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta. The eclampsia rate was 0.77% (59\/7500 deliveries). The perinatal mortality rate for eclamptic infants was 32.7%, compared to 10.5% for the total perinatal mortality rate. Pediatricians divided the infants into 3 groups based on the drug used to treat eclampsia: diazepam only (group I); largactil, diazepam, and phenargan (group II); and largactil, pethidine, and phenargan (group III). Group III infants had the greatest mortality rate (66.7%), followed by group I infants (25.8%) and group II infants (18.1%). The still born rate was also highest among group III infants (40.02% vs. 4.76% for group I and 4.52% for group II). Since largactil enhances the respiratory depressant effect of pethidine, it may account for the higher mortality among group III infants. The mode of delivery associated with the highest mortality rate was forceps delivery (35%), largely because forceps were used in very sick mothers and those who were in more intractable convulsion. All infants less than 1.5 kg at 28-32 weeks gestation died. The fact that another study found the mortality rate for this infant group to be 18.28% indicated that the high mortality was due to the effect of the drugs. The mortality rate of the 1.5-2 kg group at 28-32 weeks gestation was 50%. Based on these findings, the pediatric researchers concluded that the combination of pethidine and largactil was responsible for the high mortality rate, especially the still born rate.

A total of 169 (34%) had microfilariae of the skin by direct microscopy. The highest prevalence rate (81%) was found among the Nilotic people living along the southern banks of the Blue Nile River. Most patient had wide spread skin infection. Epidemiological differences were also observed. The study area was the Blue Nile valley of Mendi District, with 1160 inhabitants within the Wollega administrative region of Ethiopia. The population of 3 villages representing different ethnic groups and residential altitudes were considered. The villages were Gomi (1700 m), Dalati (1200 m), and Siba (700 m) representing highland Oromos, Midland Oromos and Nilotics, and lowland Nilotics, respectively. Out of the total population, a sample size of 493 was selected randomly. Parasitological examination was done with one skin snip, 2-3 mm in diameter, taken from the pelvic girdle and another one from the shoulder area. 169 (34%) of the total 493 examined had onchocerciasis. Only 3 of 101 highland Oromos had microfilaria in the skin, while 130 (81%) of 160 Sirba Nilotic were infected. The Midland Oromos (Dalati) and Dalati Nilotics had infection rates of 6% and 24%, respectively. In the higher altitudes males were more often infected than females, probably because they travel more often to the infected lowland. No such tendency was seen among the Sirba Nilotics who live permanently in the lowland. In all areas, there were increased infection rates in older age. This was most significant in the Sirba and Dafati Nilotics among people above 30 years of age. In all places, positive skin snips were found slightly more often in the lower parts of the body. Out of total 169 infected persons, 46 (27%) had microfilaria in the pelvic girdle only, while 11 (7%) had positive result only in the shoulder area. 112 (66%) had positive skin snips both in the pelvic girdle and the shoulder. All 169 infected persons underwent eye examination. Moving microfilaria were not demonstrated in any of them by slit lamp examination of both eyes. Typical eye changes suggestive of onchocerciasis were not found. There were only 16 typical onchocercoma cases in 12 of the 169 infected persons. 2 of these were in the head, 8 in the shoulder or upper thorax and 6 in the pelvic girdle area. 10 of the 12 people with nodules were Sirba Nilotics.

Proper health education and community involvement are, therefore, necessary to achieve control of malaria in the locality. The study village of Kurandhi has a population of 3608, 83.0% of whom are tribal people, and 99% of the population is illiterate. A total of 356 inhabitants belonging to 98 randomly selected families were interviewed by means of a self-administered questionnaire to elicit information about the perceptions of the community on the mode of disease transmission, resting and breeding habits of mosquitoes, and treatment and mosquito control measures. 46% of the respondents were aware that malaria is caused by mosquito bite, the rest believed that it is caused by the wrath of God (20%) witchcraft (15%), strolling in a forested area (4%), eating stale food (2%), drinking bad water (1%), while about 10% of tribal people were ignorant about the mode of disease transmission. 50% of respondents were cognizant about the symptoms of malaria and the need to get their blood examined in case of fever. However, 50.0% revealed that in case of fever they would prefer to obtain treatment from tribal healers (20%), practice witchcraft (15%), use wild herbs (8%), use chili (4%), or turmeric powder (3%). 58% of the respondents were aware that mosquitoes rested in human dwellings, 30% believed that they lived in cattle sheds and jungles, and the rest did not know. The majority of respondents did not know about the breeding place of mosquitoes. 60% were aware that spraying insecticides in the village was intended to kill mosquitoes, 20.0% believed that it killed house flies, and the rest did not know. 30% knew that mud plastering should not be done after insecticidal spray, however, about 80% of the population would mud plaster their houses within a week of spray. 7% used smoke to drive away the mosquitoes or used Kuranji oil as repellent to prevent mosquito bites.

The families were studied in-depth and detail in relation to their health status in the form of morbidities and utilisation of preventive and promotive services. The health service impact was mainly assessed through comparative study between these who availed the services and to these who did not. Similarly, environmental sanitation services impact on health was measured through comparing the slum group with those who lived in Pucca houses. The criteria of priority decision on determinants was attempted through analysis of cost of these services and comparing their beneficial effects on health. The study was undertaken in urban slums of Calcutta and at the Urban Health Center, Chetla (UHC), a field practice area of the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Calcutta. The first community received only health care services but no environmental sanitation services, the second one received only environmental services but no health care services, the third community had both health care and environmental services, and the fourth had none. Each of the 4 groups consisted of 80 families. Those who took advantage of the UHC health care services were compared to those who did not. Similarly, the impact of environmental sanitation services on health was measured through comparing the group who lived in pucca houses (multistoried flats). 2 groups each in pucca houses and slums primarily used UHC comprehensive health care services, while the groups who did not take advantage of UHC services used hospitals (88% in pucca houses and 96% in slums) and private practitioners (24% in pucca houses and 11% in slums). The incidence of sickness per 100 persons in 2 residential areas was significantly higher among slum dwellers in all ages and sex groups (79% for males [p  0.05], 83.5% for females, and 81.1% for children) as compared to those residing in pucca houses (59.8%, 54%, and 57.2%, respectively). For all ages taken together, females suffered comparatively more than males among slum dwellers, whereas this was the reverse among pucca house residents. The incidence rates were significantly lower among beneficiaries of UHC than among those who did not use the services except for the age group  5 years. The sickness rate was around 63% for all ages vs. around 74% of those not using UHC. Analysis of variance substantiated that both type of residence and utilization of UHC had a significant impact (p  0.01) on the morbidity rates and the average duration of sickness per person, but the effects of utilization of services was not more than 3 times that of residence.

A proportional to population size sampling method was used for the whole country, and 1933 subjects were screened. A pre- designed questionnaire was used to collect details of BCG scar, age, sex, residence area, nationality, education, occupation and tuberculosis test. The relative importance of these factors was assessed by using Logistic Regression Analysis. The extent to which these factors affected the severity of tuberculosis was also examined. A number of statistically significant association were found between positive tuberculin test (&gt; 10mm) and age (p &lt; 0.0001), sex (p = 0.018), nationality (p = 0.009), residence area (p = 0.05) and occupation (p = 0.0003). During January 1987-February 1990, a tuberculosis (TB) survey was conducted to determine risk factors associated with TB in Saudi Arabia. The health professionals used the tuberculin test (Mantoux test) to screen 11,933 individuals over 5 years old from throughout Saudi Arabia. The researchers excluded the 4212 individuals whose BCG history was not known. A positive tuberculin test (induration of =or 10 mm on the forearm) was associated with age (peaking in 15-24 year age group at 17%; increasing trend with age; p = 0.0001), sex (males more likely infected than females; p = 0.0187), nationality (non-Saudis; p = 0.009), residence (p = 0.0504), and occupation (p = 0.0003). All individuals who had a BCG history in all age groups, except the 65 and older group, were more likely to have a positive Mantoux reaction than those who had not been vaccinated with BCG (p = 0.0001). Based on these findings, the investigators concluded that screening all foreign labor within four weeks of entering Saudi Arabia for active TB should continue until the TB prevalence rate falls to 2%, that administration of BCG vaccination in the first few weeks of life should continue until the percentage of reactors to the tuberculin test falls to 2%, and that a similar study should be conducted in another five years to compare its findings with these findings. A second BCG vaccination should be administered to all persons at the age of leaving school to reduce the proportion of positive reactors in this age group (15-24) from its current rate of 17%. ","1570":"An estimated seven million babies are born of low birth weight (LBW) annually in India.  Birth weight is the most important determinant of survival and freedom from morbidity during the early life of a newborn.  Compared to babies of normal birth weight, LBW babies suffer a far higher incidence of birth asphyxia, birth trauma, infective diseases, and malnutrition.  LBW newborns are five times more likely to die during the neonatal period and three times more likely to die during infancy compared to newborns of normal birth weight.  If LBW is detected in timely fashion, however, intensive neonatal care can mollify the negative impact of the condition's related problems, thus enhancing survival and minimizing the extent of disabling handicaps.  A scientifically sound, cheap, and simple way for peripheral health workers to detect LBW babies at the large scale in communities is called for.  Any surrogate birth weight parameter must be simple, highly correlated with birth weight, and of reasonably accurate diagnostic ability.  Researchers have developed color-coded qualitative measuring tapes with markers for LBW of less than 2 kg, 2-2.5 kg, and above 2.5 kg which are usable by peripheral health workers with little instruction.  No consensus has, however, been reached on a surrogate parameter to best predict LBW.  Researchers are strongly urged to continue the search.","1571":"This one year prospective study was carried out to determine the CBR, CDR and different underfive mortality rates in some selected rural ICDS blocks of West Bengal and also to find out the common causes of infant and childhood mortality in these areas.

Compared to the picture of rural West Bengal, both still birth &amp; perinatal mortality rates were found higher in all ICDS blocks. The causes of mortality trends among under fives' were found similar to that of rural India pattern i.e. prematurity, acute respiratory infections and diarrhoea being the leaders. Neonates, who contributed the largest share of infant mortality died mainly due to prematurity. So, observations like high perinatal mortality &amp; still birth rates, huge proportion of neonatal death during infancy, same IMR but low 5MR, and death of neonates due to prematurity etc. claim the necessity of improving maternal component of ICDS services, their nutritional care in particular.","1572":"","1573":"","1574":"","1575":"","1576":"Information on births and deaths was collected in 11 randomly selected AWW areas of Barhaj Mahen ICDS project area in Eastern U.P. by an independent survey team in 1988-89.

The total death rate (7.2\/1000) was lower than the national average.  The birth rate in project areas of Uttar Pradesh was almost the same as the national average.  Postneonatal mortality showed the lowest rates compared to Uttar Pradesh and the nation.  Since this study area had been included in the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) since 1981, it is likely that the lower child mortality reflects the emphasis on ICDS services.  Underreporting of deaths is considered to be marginal.

It was found that adult of Cx.quinquefasciatus developed double resistance to DDT and dieldrin but susceptible to O.P. compounds and pyrethroids. Cx.quinquefasciatus larvae are also found susceptible to O.P compounds like malathion, temophos, fenthion and fenitrothion.","1578":"Total of 4567 sera samples obtained from high risk groups viz. blood donors, patients attending skin\/VD clinics have been examined for HIV-antibodies. None of them showed seropositivity. Since in Bihar, interaction with foreigners is not common as it is in the metropolitan cities of India, this may be one of the chief reasons for not finding any HIV-seropositive case so far. 7% of blood donors showed VDRL positive reaction. Both competitive ELISA and particulate-agglutination tests on 375 sera samples gave identical negative result. The results of blood testing for HIV antibodies in 4567 volunteer blood donors are reported.  Serum samples were collected from high risk groups in Bihar, India.  These groups included patients from skin\/venereal disease clinics, blood donors, local police, and hospital patients and attendants.  Both SERODIA-HIV  kits and Wellcozyme anti-HTLV III\/Wellcozyme HIV recombinant kits were used to detect HIV infections.  All sera were also analyzed using the VDRL flocculation test.  None of the sera tested positive for HIV antibodies.  6.94% (206\/2966) of the blood donor group tested positive using VDRL, while 4.96% (69\/1392) of the skin\/venereal disease patients tested positive with VDRL. ","1579":"The present study was conducted on 2611 school children of a rural area of Meerut, with the objectives to find out the prevalence and distribution of endemic goitre and the socioeconomic variables associated with the distribution of the endemic goitre. Grading of goitre was done as per the criteria laid down by the WHO-1979 (1). The overall prevalence rate of endemic goitre was 50.1%, the prevalence was more among females (55.1%) as compared to males (47.2%). Maximum number of goitre cases were having grade Ia enlargement (46.9%) followed by grade Ib (34.1%), grade 2(15.0%) and grade 3 (4.0%). Prevalence increased with increase in age. Statistically significant differences were found in the prevalence of endemic goitre in relation to different religions and caste groups, different occupations of the parents\/guardians of children and types of houses used for the purpose of living. Most studies of goiter show a link with lower socioeconomic status.  Goiter is endemic in areas with environmental iodine deficiency or diets high in certain foods which interfere with iodine utilization by the body.  This study aims to examine the extent of goiter and the socioeconomic factors associated with its appearance among 2611 school children in a rural areas of Meerut, India.  The student population was selected from 22 schools in the Primary Health Center Machhra Area between April 1989 and March 1990.  Prevalence of goiter was clinically determined and graded according to the World Health Organization's 1979 criteria.  Information was obtained on type of housing, occupation of parents, religion, and caste.  1308 children (50.1%) had goiter (55.1% of females and 47.2% of males).  The largest number of cases involved an enlarged goiter palpable when the neck was extended (46.9%) followed by visible enlargement when the neck was extended (34.1%).  4.0% had a grade 3 goiter (visible at a distance).  Prevalence increased with increased age.  The largest percentage of cases appeared in the age group 12-14 years (53.8%) and the fewest in the age group 6-8 years (45.3%).  Females had higher rates in all age groups; differences by age and gender are statistically significant.  Goiter prevalence was lowest among Brahmins (29.8%) followed by Guijars (38.3%), 43.8% among Jats, and 53.5% among Kumhars.  53.6% of scheduled caste members had goiter.  The highest percentage of goiter cases occurred among children of laborers (56.4%) followed by children of businessmen (51.2%).  45.1% of children of farmers and 37.0% of children of service workers had goiter.  Differences are statistically significant.  62.1% of children living in Kuchha housing and 62.6% of children living in mixed housing had goiter as opposed to only 33.1% of children living in pucca housing.  Low socioeconomic status is clearly related to the prevalence of goiter. ","1580":"Physical parameters and pulmonary function tests (VC, FEV1, FEV1% and FEF25-75%) were collected in 112 urban industrial workers and 104 rural agricultural workers. These average values, values according to age and smoking habits were compared between urban and rural workers. Inspite of no differences in age, rural workers average height, weight, BSA is significantly lower than urban workers. A significant increase in VC value to the extent of 0.22 lit (7.1%), significantly lower FEV 1% value by 4.7% and reduce FEF25-75% value (4.7%) is demonstrated in rural than urban workers. Smoking is shown to produce airway obstruction in both urban and rural workers. A wide variation of PFT values between the present workers and other reported values in India is observed. This study indicates rural workers have better pulmonary capacity and less flow rates than their urban counterpart.","1581":"Total 240 cases of 2-12 years age group who had contact of tuberculosis indirectly or directly and had chronic illness were screened for tuberculosis. Out of 240 cases, 180 cases were diagnosed as tuberculosis. Special emphasis was given on Mantoux Test (M.T.), though the battery of tests were done to diagnose tuberculosis. Out of 180 cases of Tuberculosis, M.T. was Positive in 97 cases (40.41%) and repeat M.T. was done after 3 weeks and was converted to Positive in 20 cases (8.33%). Thus only M.T. help in diagnosis of Tuberculosis in almost 50% of the cases. Childhood tuberculosis (TB) in India affects more than 40% of individuals under the age of 15 years.  Diagnosis of childhood TB is difficult due to the various clinical presentations and the cost of diagnosis kits.  This article reports on the value of the Mantoux test in the diagnosis of TB in children.  240 children between the ages of 2 and 12 years were studied; 180 were diagnosed as having TB.  These children had a history of chronic illness and direct or indirect contact with TB.  All patients were tested for TB using tests such as Mantoux, Roentgenogram, E.S.R., and complete hemogram.  Nutritional status was determined using criteria established by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics.  97 (40.41%) of the 180 children with TB had a positive diagnosis with the Mantoux test.  The 4-8 year age group was found to have the greatest number of cases in this study.  60\/180 (33%) positive TB cases were reported for this group.  It was noted that the higher the socio-economic status, the lower the incidence of TB. ","1582":"Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are major health problems all over the world including India, although available data on the magnitude of STDs in India is of questionable quality.  The annual incidence of STD in India as reported to the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence during 1989 was approximately 14 million.  Community-based studies and other limited studies suggest that HIV rates are high in both rural and urban areas.  A national STD control program has been in operation since the mid-1950s.  The program is clinic based, however, and covers only 5% of all STD patients in the country, with the majority of patients attending private health care providers, the informal sector, or resorting to self medication.  In acknowledgement of the need to strengthen the STD control program, especially in the context of the recently launched AIDS control program, efforts are being made to extend the existing program at the community level through existing private health care services in the country.  A phased approach to implementing the STD Control Program in the 32 states and union territories has been adopted.  This programmatic extension from the clinic to the community has become a necessity as the vast majority of patients are being treated without laboratory investigation by private practitioners.  Efforts to control STDs should focus upon increasing the availability and acceptance of curative and preventive measures by individual patients and the community.  Sustained support from national and international agencies will be needed in order for this new strategy to be successful.","1583":"","1584":"It is imperative that health and morbidity data in India at the district level are collected regularly, analyzed, and interpreted with appropriate epidemiological tools.  With that in mind, the government of India, since 1990, has strengthened its training of applied epidemiology.  The Field Epidemiology Training Program was implemented to create a capability in field epidemiology within the existing health services system to help health authorities at the district level make informed decisions in the delivery of health care.  This paper describes the existing health profile, deficiencies\/gaps and justifications, program objectives and components, the expected outcome, the project plan, and achievements.","1585":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis was clinically diagnosed by non-healing skin lesions present on dorsal surface of nose (Snout) and outer surface of ear and by making impression smear from lesions.

Although early start and prolonged breast feeding was an universal practise, but timely weaning was neglected and offered to 54.5% of infants only. On the contrary, introduction of artificial milk to young infants was a culturally accepted baby feeding. A cross-sectional investigation into the breast feeding and weaning practices of lactating mothers in 2 randomly selected villages in Sonarpur Block of South 24-Parganas district of West Bengal was conducted from June 1, 1990, to July 31, 1990.  57 lactating mothers were sampled and found to universally practice early and prolonged breast feeding.  Although 52.6% of infants were offered sweet water and only 24.6% were offered breast milk as first feed, all 57 were put on breast milk within 24 hours of delivery.  Maternal illness was primarily responsible for 8.8% of the infants being withdrawn from breast milk during the first 6 months of infancy.  All 26 infants older than 6 months continued to receive breast milk.  Timely weaning, however, was neglected and offered to only 54.5% of infants.  The introduction of artificial milk to young infants was culturally accepted and practiced in 35 cases.  77.2% of these subjects received such milk before reaching 6 months of age; the introduction took place in 62.9% of cases due to insufficiencies of maternal breast milk. ","1587":"One hundred five In-service nursing personnel of West Bengal Health Service, who completed a two day's orientation training programme on AIDS were subjected to Pre and Post-training assessment of their knowledge relating to AIDS by the same written questionnaire. Significant improvement in percentage of subjects (from 7.6% pre-training to 51.4% post-training) with desirable level of awareness and knowledge could be achieved by the programme. The importance of inclusion of study of AIDS in the pre- qualification curriculum and continuing education for nursing personnel is stressed. Nurses play a central role in the delivery of health care in the West Bengal Health Service.  Trained nurses already in service, however, were not taught about AIDS in their general nursing Midwifery course or during their undergraduate education.  These nurses and new ones entering the field, therefore, urgently need to be trained in this area. This paper reports the impact of a training program targeted to 105 in-service nurses at the Medical College and District Hospital of West Bengal.   The nurses were subjected to a 2-day orientation training program on AIDS and assessed on the level of awareness and knowledge relating to AIDS on a written questionnaire at both pre- and post-training.   Although only 7.6% of the subjects had desirable levels of awareness and knowledge at baseline, this percentage increased to 51.4% after the intervention.  The authors stress the importance of initial and continued training of nursing personnel on AIDS.

It was found that the average no. of episodes per person was 0.99 of which drugs were consumed for 72% of episodes. Significant difference was observed in consumption of drugs between males and females. Allopathic medicines were consumed for 93.3% of the episodes and the major source (53.8%) of medical care was from private practitioners. It was seen that the number of drugs consumed per episode of sickness rose as the per capita income increased. Vitamins and Minerals (22.3%) were the main group of drugs consumed. Drugs acting on the alimentary system (17.5%), Respiratory System (14.7%), Antimicrobials (14.6%) and Analgesics (10.8%) contributed to 80% of drug intake.","1589":"A study of 4326 students, selected by stratified random sampling and using a self administered questionnaire, revealed that overall cannabis abuse among them was 4.5%. It amounted to a considerable decline in prevalence compared to 10.2% observed in 1976. However, it was noted that this reduction was mainly in occasional users and the proportion of regular users has actually increased in 1986. The prevalence has also shown an increase among girl students. The regular users were mainly from professional colleges, hailing from metropolitan cities and with relatively higher amount of pocket money at their disposal. It was concluded that the observed trends could be due to peer pressures. It was also considered that health education of such students at entry point may help reduce the problem.","1590":"HIV infection and AIDS have only begun to hit India.  While prevention is paramount in the fight against HIV infection, counseling services must also be made available to individuals who are already infected with HIV.  Counseling affords direct interpersonal contact and the opportunity to pose questions of health personnel.  This process helps infected and\/or sick individuals to better absorb information and cope with all the aspects of HIV infection.  Data suggest that STD infection rates have declined in some African countries where counseling programs have been put into place.  Given these merits of counseling, the government of India should develop and implement appropriate policy guidelines, while providing the necessary facilities and manpower to meet patient needs.","1591":"","1592":"In a cross sectional study of total 14514 tribal Nicobarese people of Car Nicobar Island, an union territory of India, situated in Bay of Bengal, morbidity, mortality and treatment practices of diarrhoeal diseases of under-five children were surveyed. The incidence of diarrhoea (0.2 episode\/ch.year), Crude death rate (3.6\/1000) and IMR (31\/1000 live births) were exceedingly low as compared to SouthEast Asian Countries including mainland of India. ORS utilisation rate was high (41%) as compared to the National figure (12.0%). This is the first study of it's kind carried out in this island and amongst the Nicobarese tribe in India. A preliminary study carried out among the mothers of the hospitalised children indicated that protective behaviours like breast feeding, hand washing, use of chlorinated water and proper disposal of stool were regularly being practiced by the community traditionally. An in-depth study on risk factors of diarrhoea in this island can yield useful clue for describing the same.","1593":"","1594":"","1595":"","1596":"","1597":"","1598":"While conducting a leprosy survey in an urban slum in Pune 45 cases of leprosy were detected in a population of 4915 and only 7 of these cases had some disability.

Results of HIV screening among blood donors received from the 4 Metropolitan cities of Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras have been analysed year wise from 1989 to 1991 to determine the magnitude and trends of HIV infection in different categories of blood donors and the seropositivity rates seems to be increasing over time. Universal coverage of HIV screening for donated blood has not been fully achieved and the justification and urgency for achieving complete coverage is highlighted. In India, an analysis of monthly reports (January 1989-December 1991) received from 140 blood banks in India's 4 Zonal Blood Testing Centres in Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay, ad Madras compared the cities HIV infection rates and examined the progression of these rates among different categories of blood donors.  Blood screening did not begin in Calcutta until 1990.  In 1991, a considerable difference existed between the number of blood units collected and the units tested in Madras and Calcutta (a difference of 32.5% and 61.04%, respectively).  The proportion tested was highest in Delhi (95.5%) followed by Bombay (87.3%).  HIV seropositivity rates remained elevated in all cities among all blood donor groups, except Calcutta.  In Bombay, these rates were 9.81\/1000 samples screened in 1989, 7.36 in 1990, and 8.65 in 1991.  In Delhi, they were 0.89 0.64, and 1.69, respectively.  In Madras, they were 1.02, 3.2, and 6.21, respectively.  The 1990 and 1991 rates in Calcutta were just 0.12 and 0.02, respectively.  The highest HIV infection rates were greatest in professional blood donors in Bombay and Madras.  Between 1989 and 1991, they fell in Bombay (42.02-12.34) and rose in Madras (2.81-18.47).  Professional blood donors made up 16.82% of all donors in Madras, 10.56% in Bombay, 18.94% in Calcutta, and 33.8% in Delhi.  Since 90% of voluntary blood donors were males, the 1991 HIV infection rate of voluntary blood donors indicated that HIV had established itself in males in Bombay (9.06) and Madras (4.03) and less so in Delhi (1.9).  In Calcutta, the HIV infection rate among voluntary donors was 013 in 1990, while it was 0 in 1991.  India has yet to completely achieve HIV screening.

The information, can be useful for public health and further research.","1640":"","1641":"","1642":"","1643":"","1644":"","1645":"The present study revealed that the majority of nurses had adequate knowledge about dietary practices during the antenatal and post-natal period. However, their knowledge about nutritive value of foods and nutrition advice during disease conditions was inadequate. It is recommended that to make the training more meaningful, the identification of the incorrect dietary beliefs of trainees should be done at the beginning of the training course. Each incorrect belief should be explained in detail for better comprehension of the correct knowledge in nutrition.","1646":"","1647":"The Central Government of Calcutta, India aimed to immunize 85% (85,262) of the city's 12 month old infants against polio, diphtheria, measles, tuberculosis, pertussis and tetanus.  The Universal Immunization Program (UIP) achieved this target 3 months earlier than intended.  In fact, at the end of December 1990, it achieved 110.6% for DPT3, 142.16% for OPV3, 151.96% for BCG, and 97% for measles.  UIP was able to surpass its targets by emphasizing team work.  Government, the private sector, UNICEF, and the voluntary sector made up the Apex Coordination Committee on Immunization headed up by the mayor. The committee drafted an action plan which included routine immunization sessions on a fixed day and intensive immunization drives.  Further the involved organizations pooled together cold chain equipment.  In addition, the District Family Welfare Bureau was the distribution center for vaccines, syringes, immunization cards, report formats, vaccine carriers, and ice packs.  Health workers administered immunizations from about 300 centers generally on Wednesday, National Immunization Day.  Intensive immunization drives focused on measles immunizations.  UIP leaders encouraged all center to routinely record coverage and submit monthly progress reports to the District Family Welfare Bureau.  The Calcutta Municipal Corporation coordinated promotion activities and social mobilization efforts.  Promotion included radio and TV announcements, newspaper advertisements, cinema slides, billboards, and posters.  The original UIP plan to use professional communicators to mobilize communities was ineffective, so nongovernmental organizations entered the slums to encourage people to encourage their neighbors to immunize their children.  Further Islamic, Protestant, and Catholic leaders encouraged the faithful to immunize their children.  A UNICEF officer noted that this success must be sustained, however.","1648":"In 1990, the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) was able to do fairly well in Assam and West Bengal in India.  Immunization coverage rates varied as low as 59.5% for measles in Assam and 69.63% in West Bengal to as high as 80.13% for BCG and 104.73% respectively.  All primary health centers provided immunizations on Mondays in Assam and on Wednesdays in West Bengal.  Eventually district and block health officials extended these fixed days to subcenter and village levels.  Further major hospitals provided them daily.  Moreover health workers from various agencies conducted 2 special immunization sessions in October, November, and December 1990 at 1 month intervals in areas with a large uncovered child population so as to fully immunize children against certain diseases.  Obstacles prevented adequate immunization coverage in Calcutta, West Bengal so by April 1990 DPT3 coverage was only 29% and that of measles 13%.  Thus the Calcutta Municipal Corporation arranged 3 immunization campaigns lasting 6 days in october, November, and December 1990 in which health workers from 4 different agencies vaccinated the children.  Measles coverage increased to 61%.  In 1990, health workers conducted immunization activities in tea gardens where many people worked in Upper Assam such as fixed days and outreach to neighboring areas.  Both the Assam and West Bengal State Governments gave UIP a high priority such as the formation of a task force on UIP.  Further laborer groups helped launch a campaign in West Bengal.  The Muslim leader of Calcutta encouraged all Muslims in West Bengal to become immunized.  Moreover organizations including the Ministry of Social Welfare and Lions and Rotary Clubs joined the Ministry of Health in immunization efforts.  The UIP used folk media and the mass media to disseminate information and educate the public about immunizations.  The Project Officer for UNICEF covered UIP sustainability issues such as political commitment and maintenance of the cold chain.","1649":"","1650":"Health information system is not well developed in most parts of the country. We propose to use locally available data on immunization performance so as to make them more informative and useful for implementing and supervisory personnel. Reclassification of data according to estimated number of eligibles, monthly performance and age of children immunized can given impressions about coverage, sustainability of services and their quality. Similarly, area and institution-wise data can be used to identify places needing more attention. Active use of available data will help in improvement of vaccine coverage and control of target diseases. Immunization performance data (1985-89) from a district health office in a state of India were analyzed to demonstrate various means to make the data more useful in monitoring the universal immunization program (UIP).  The proposed system was community based.  Ideally it should be computerized.  Considerable differences in immunization coverage existed between the eligible population and actual number immunized.  It was proposed that sustainability of immunization performance by evaluated by having district authorities review reports monthly and quarterly.  In this district, immunization activities increased in the December-March period for al vaccines.  It is pointed out that the best results would be obtained when sustained quality activities are provided year round.  The UIP should redesign forms to report vaccines given to infants only.  Narrow class intervals (e.g., 6 months for BCG, DPT3, and OPV3) would be most helpful.  In the district, 82.1-99.7% of immunized infants received a vaccine in the 1st year.  UIP monitoring should separate data by area to see where improvements are needed.  Immunization coverage was greater in urban areas of the district than at rural primary health centers (PHC) and subcenters.  It is also suggested that data from each PHC be separated out to determine the quality of coverage\/vaccine.  For example, a plus sign equaled 80% coverage.  Using data to constantly monitor immunization activities will improve vaccine coverage and control target diseases. ","1651":"Immunisation coverage evaluation was carried out in 9 Blocks of West Bengal amongst 12-23 months old children. Fully immunised status of 5 blocks were under 16%. Poor measles vaccine coverage thought to be the reason. Other vaccine coverage was more than 60%, in most of the blocks excepting Hilly Balurghat and Tamluk. \"Child ill-not brought\" was the important reason for immunisation failure in most of the blocks. Between January-September 1990, surveys were conducted in 9 areas of West Bengal, India to learn why immunization failure occurred in 12-23 month old children and the extent of service use from different types of health care facilities.  Retention of immunization cards varied from 28.6% in Balurghat to 76.9% in urban Dhakuria.  The percentage of fully immunized children ranged from only 1.9% in Balurghat to 45.9% in Siliguri-Naxalbari.  In fact, fully immunized status in 5 areas was 16%.  Fully immunized was defined as children having received 3 doses of both OPV and DPT and 1 dose of BCG and of measles.  The leading reason for children not being fully immunized was not having received the measles vaccine.  The lowest measles immunization coverage was in Balurghat (3.8%).  Those areas with medical colleges had higher measles coverage (Mogra, 68.8%; Pandua, 51.62%; and Siliguri-Naxalbari, 51.2%).  In 5 areas, 10% of the children had not been immunized.  12.7% of the children in Mogra were not immunized.  In the other 3 areas, the percentage of nonimmunized children ranged from 20.75 to 43.6%.  Dropout rates for DPT were 40% in Hilli and Balurghat.  North Calcutta had the lowest dropout rate for DPT (13.83%).  OPV dropout rates ranged from 10.58% in North Calcutta to 50.33% in Hilli.  The major reason for immunization failure in 4 of the 5 areas (North Calcutta, Dhakuria, Tamluk, and Pandua) where reasons were investigated was child ill-not brought (20.9-31.7%).  The major reason in Siliguri was unaware of need for immunization (19.2%) which was also a significant reason in Pandua (20.9%) and Tamluk (14.88%).  Another leading reason included mother too busy.  The primary health center administered 75% of the vaccines in Pandua and Tamluk and 50% in Siliguri-Naxalbari.  Outreach services and hospitals administered most vaccines in North Calcutta and Dhakuria. ","1652":"In Bombay, the immunization coverage with 3 doses of oral polio vaccine in children below 2 years of age has reached 80%. As a result, the high incidence of over 11\/100,000 population prevailing in the 6 year period (1982-1987) has declined to around 6 in 1988 and 1989. The decline was observed both in the slum and in the \"non-slum\" population. The incidence in the slum population has reduced from over 22\/100,000 population to around 11. In the morbidity, a subtle \"age shift\" to older children was noticed in 1988-1989. Average age-specific incidence (for age group below 1 year) was found to be 1.04\/1000 children in 1988-89 as against 2.47 in the preceding 6 years. The proportion of \"Non-Immunized\" cases gradually declined from 65.8% in 1982 to 49.7% in 1989 and conversely, the proportion of fully immunized cases increased from 14.5% in 1982 to 22.7% in 1989. The attack rates per 1000 children below 1 year of age in the inadequately\/\"Non-Immunized\" and the fully immunized children were found to be 2.822 and 0.224 respectively. The sharp peak in the morbidity observed in the 3rd quarter of an year (July to September) has been replaced by almost even distribution of cases in all the quarters of an year. All the three polioviruses were encountered through out the year. Although, poliovirus type 1 was the most predominant of viruses, its proportion was on decline. The portion of isolation of \"Non-Polio\" viruses has increased from 6.8% in 1982 to 16.2% in 1989.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1653":"","1654":"","1655":"The review of the National Immunization Programme of India in 1989 focused attention to the issue of storage and distribution of vaccines.  Cold-chain equipment such as walk-in-coolers (WICs), deep freezers, ice-lined refrigerators (ILRs), and vaccine carriers proliferated after the introduction of the universal immunization program (UIP) but the available units fell short of the official targets in 1988, especially ILRs (7500 proposed and 2876 available) and vaccine carriers (250,000 proposed and 35,500 available).   Some states had over 6 months of supplies of vaccines whose management posed problems of losing potency:  oral polio virus (OPV) potency was acceptable in 63% of stock in 1988.  Syringes, needles, stoves, pressure-cooker sterilizers, dial thermometers, and refrigerator repair kits were in short supply especially at the primary health care (PHC) level.  Only 1\/3 of subcenters had sterilizers and 58% had vaccines carriers.  Logistics management on the state level required provision of vaccines based on previous use and eligible population with even distribution throughout the year.  On the district level WICs were needed for every district with 1.5 million inhabitants.  Recording of vaccine requirement, utilization, and storage would aid target allocations and avoid wastage.  On the institutional and PHC level an ILR and a transporting vehicle was needed.  The number of women and children eligible for immunization had to be calculated based on real population figures.  Cold-chain capacity of 30,000-40,000 vials was required for a district as well as about 500 reusable syringes and needles a year along with vaccination cards exceeding the number of women and children by 10% for recordkeeping at the PHC center.","1656":"Immunization programme was launched in India in 1978. Immunization coverage is not uniform in all the States. More efforts are needed to achieve universal immunization in the whole country. UIP should be a part of an integrated MCH programme and should not be considered as an isolated programme. Disease surveillance is not satisfactory and to ascertain the impact of immunization surveillance system must be strengthened.","1657":"This article reports the findings of a study concerning the socioeconomic characteristics of women undergoing sterilization in India.  Only 23% of India's 119 million couples use some form of contraception, but of these, 87% rely on male or female sterilization.  It is estimated that some 20 million married women of reproductive age have been sterilized.  This study examined the cases of 800 women who underwent sterilization at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Kamla Nehru Hospital, Shimla from February 1986 to April 1987.  In addition to investigating the socioeconomic characteristics of the women, the study also focused on the knowledge and practice of other contraceptive methods, the motivating factors, and the reasons for undergoing sterilization.  The study found that 68% of the women were from rural areas and 32% from urban areas.  71% of the women belonged to lower social classes -- only 40% of the women were literate.  98% of the women were Hindus, the remaining 2% belonging to other religious groups.  72.9% of the women were between the ages of 20 and 33 years, the mean age at sterilization being 27.5 years.  While 77.3% of the women has 2 or 3 living children, only 2.6% had only 1 living child.  71.2% of the women had both male and female children, and 9.2% had only female children.  Concerning the use of contraception, only 22% of the women had practiced contraception prior to the operation.  70% of the women reported being self-motivated, while 26% said that they had been motivated by a family planning worker or hospital staff member.  96.5% of the women reported multiparity and\/or socioeconomic reasons for undergoing the procedure, while 3.5% of the sterilizations were performed for therapeutic reasons.","1658":"The efficacy of Mebendazole and Niclosamide was studied in two groups of 24 and 38 cases, respectively of patients suffering from taeniasis. Mebendazole with dose schedule of 200 and 300 mg twice daily for 3 consecutive days showed a cure rate of 71.42% and 92.30%, whereas Niclosamide at the dose rate of 200mg per patient was 94.76% effective. Flubendazole showed a cure rate of 66.66% only. Mebendazole and Niclosamide possess high taeniacidal activity, ability to reduce the clinical symptoms of taeniasis without any side effects. Niclosamide with high activity and excellent tolerance, is a drug of choice for the treatment of taeniasis in single dose treatment while for hymenolepsiasis it needs extended course.","1659":"134 cases of accidental poisoning in children have been reported, children belonging to the age group of 1-3 years are the main victims. Kerosene has been noted as the single most important cause of poisoning. Mortality was fortunately low amounting to 5.2% of all cases. The findings of a study on accidental poisoning in children admitted in the pediatric ward of Burdwan Medical College Hospital, a rural hospital in West Bengal, India, are reported.  From January to December 1987, 134 cases of poisoning in children up to 7 years of age were examined.  Poisons were categorized into the following groups:  1) organic substances and caustic substances, 2) kerosene, 3) heavy metals 4) plant produces, 5) drugs, 6) insecticides and pesticides and 7) unknown.  Lacking facilities in which to chemically identify poisons, the history of the case was thoroughly examined and close clinical observations were conducted.  Kerosene, the most common poison was found in 57 (42.5%) of the 134 children.  Insecticides and pesticides were the second most common poison, affecting 28 (20.9%) of the children.  The incidence of the remaining poisons were:  plant products, 9.7%; organic solvents and caustic substances, 9.0% unknown, 6.7% drugs, 6.0%; and heavy metals, 5.2%.  Most of the cases occurred among children up to 3 years of age.  74% of the cases were male.  Mortality was low -- 5.2% of the cases.  The most common poison, kerosene, is largely used as a fuel and light source.  60% of the kerosene poisoning cases occurred among children aged 1-3, an age at which the child is curious and liked to put things into his or her mouth.  The insecticides and pesticides category, the 2nd most common poison, includes organophosphorus compounds, rat killers, and organochlorine compounds.

Illiteracy, domestic unhappiness, deception, destitution, poor socio-ecomic status of parents, and religious custom of Devdasi were the important contributory factors for landing innocent girls or socially handicapped women into prostitution.","1667":"Education concerning prevailing health problems and the method of preventing and controlling them was considered to be one of the first eight essential activities in primary health care. Hence this study was attempted to assess the impact of health education on the knowledge, attitude and practices of school children aged 10-14 years in two secondary schools situated in Burdwan District of West Bengal. For this purpose health education was imparted by a team consisting of Medical Officer and Paramedical staff. Education was given on personnel hygiene. The entire education programme was arranged in such a way that the course could be completed in six months time. The knowledge, attitude and practice status of the students was assessed before imparting training, twice during the training period at an interval of three months and finally after 9 months from the start of training. The evaluation was done with the help of scoring. The results indicated that the health knowledge of the student significantly improved after education. Attitude of the students towards personal hygiene also improved significantly after education. The practice of personal hygiene improved significantly as well. The present study also revealed that the improvement in health practice was not commensurating with the improvement of knowledge and attitude after education.","1668":"","1669":"Prostitutes from Madras were found seropositive for HIV infection in 1986, and are the 1st such cases identified in India.  A national serosurveillance program and reference centers were subsequently created, finding a total 44 known AIDS cases through March 31, 1990.  While this number of cases may seem small in the general context of India's large population size, increasing levels of seropositivity are being detected, and give cause for concern.  Where recent studies of seropositivity in IV-drug users have created serious concern, serosurveillance has nonetheless been largely limited to prostitutes, STD patients, pregnant women, blood donors, and contacts of seropositive individuals.  Ignorance and stigmatization of seropositive individuals and persons with AIDS persist both in the general public and the medical community.  Doctors, nurses, and staff therefore are in special need of proper orientation to treat and counsel such clients.  Indian health authorities are overwhelmingly challenged by how to care for AIDS cases, and do not know what to do with those who are seropositive.  Hospitals and facilities for supportive treatment will be identified.  Seropositive individuals especially need psychological support and counseling.  Guidelines for counseling are therefore greatly needed.   Those identified as seropositive must also be ensured that their status will remain confidential.

A total of 4469 cases occurred during the period. 45.7% of diarrhoea cases sampled and 47.6% of water samples collected from rivers were found to be positive for V.cholerae biotype EITor. Case fatality rate in this epidemic was exceptionally low (0.8%) which was attributed to the early domiciliary use of oral rehydration salt solution (ORS) in the affected villages. Utility of ORS in drastic reduction of case fatality rate during any epidemic situation was first of its kind in the Indian scene. Between July-September 1978, an outbreak of gastroenteritis among all age groups (total of 4469 reported cases) occurred in various villages in the Central District of Manipur State, India including Imphal.  Upon notification of the epidemic, health workers distributed oral rehydration salt solution (ORS) generously so people could begin taking ORS as soon as any diarrhea appeared.  Researchers from the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases investigated 92 active cases who were either in the hospital or the community.  They collected the data from records of the Regional Medical College, the Directorate of Public Health in Imphal, Primary Health Centers in Thoubal and Kakching, and by visiting active cases at home.  45.7% of fecal samples and 47.6% of river water samples tested positive for Vibrio cholerae biotype ElTor.  The case fatality rates fell significantly during the 3 months from 2% for 5 year old children to 0.7% to no deaths at all and 1.9% for 5 year old people to 0.6% to no deaths (p.05).  The overall case fatality rate was just 0.8% (36 deaths), it was higher for 5 year old children than it was for 5 year old people (1% vs. 0.7%).  Data on earlier cholera epidemics in Manipur were not available, but the researchers found the case fatality rates in cholera epidemics (ElTor) before ORS varied from 22-24%.  In fact, they believed this cholera epidemic to be the 1st use of ORS under field conditions which happened to result in a case fatality rate of 1%. ","1676":"Researchers followed 90 households (445 people) in Sunderpur slum in Varanasi in Upper Pradesh, India for 1 year and collected stool samples when people were ill with diarrhea to determine diarrhea incidence and causes of diarrheal disease.  The water supply consisted of a well, public tap, or house tap with 30 households in each group.  They noted 106 diarrheal episodes for an incidence of around 23%.  Incidence decreased significantly with age (p.001).  For example, it was 62.9% for children 5 years old, 34% in the school age population, and 8.7% in people =or 15 years old.  Improved resistance to infection and\/or improved personal hygiene could have accounted for this difference.  Diarrheal incidence was considerably lower in the autumn (9.3%) and winter months (11.1%) than the spring (49.1%) and summer months [rainy season] (30.5%) (p.001).  Researchers found at least 1 parasite in the stool sample of 81.5% of cases.  The leading causative agents included Ascaris lumbricoides (42.1%), Entamoeba histolytica (35.2%), hookworm (7.9%), and Escherichia coli (5.7%).  Diarrhea incidence was much higher in persons whose water supply was a well (35.8%) compared to 23.2% for those with a public tap, and 12.8% for those with a private tap.  These results concerning the water supply corroborated those of the Planning Research and Action Institute's (Upper Pradesh) pilot piped water supply program in the areas of Banki, Parendra, and Mokhampur in which incidence was highest in Banki where the water supply was an open well.  The next highest and the lowest incidences were among those whose water supply consisted of public taps and private taps respectively.","1677":"An outbreak of acute diarrhoeal disease between August and October 1985 in 3 districts of Manipur state was investigated amongst 9,29,077 population at risk. The overall attack rate and case fatality rate were 0.2% and 0.9% respectively. Hospital records revealed that 58.8% of cases occurred amongst older children above 5 years of age. V.cholera was isolated from 25.3% of cases sampled. Interestingly, increased frequency in weekly admission of cases amongst children during first two years of life increased in the beginning of October when the original peak of diarrhoeal outbreak was about to decline. The October peak was caused by rotavirus which could be detected from 50.0% of diarrhoeal children in this age group. This possibly reflected beginning of the usual rotavirus diarrhoea season in the locality. Between August 24-October 20, 1985, an outbreak of acute diarrheal disease occurred among 1833 children in Imphal, Bishenpur, and Thoubal districts in Manipur State in India for an overall attach rate of 2\/1000.  17 children died, a case fatality rate of 9\/1000.  Hospital and health center personnel treated 1711 cases with rehydration therapy (oral or intravenous fluids).  Local, mainly unqualified, practitioners treated the remaining 122 cases with antidarrheal drugs.  Children treated at home were more likely to die than those treated at health facilities (case fatality rates 0.6% vs. 4.9%; p.001).  Nevertheless these case fatality rates were lower than those in a 1973-1974 outbreak of gastroenteritis in Manipur, perhaps because the health authority distributed oral rehydration solution packets during this 1985 epidemic.  The leading symptoms were watery diarrhea (82.5%), vomiting (67.5%), and abdominal pain (37.5%).  Children 5 years old tended to experience severe dehydration more so than younger children (31.3% vs. 12.5%).  58.8% of hospitalized cases were older children who suffered the highest death rate.  (1.9%).  Peak admissions occurred the last week of September ending on October 2.  Yet during the decline phase, the admission rate of children 2 years old rose.  25.3% of cases sampled recovered V. cholerae with the highest isolation rate (30.8%) found in older children and adults.  50% of fecal samples of children 6-23 months old tested positive for rotavirus.  The researchers did not find any obvious epidemiological link between the 3 areas.  They concluded that the rotavirus epidemic which peaked the week after that of cholera represented the beginning of the usual rotavirus diarrhea season. ","1678":"In an operational research on the improvement of sanitation and water supply by an Indo-Dutch project at Mirzapur, UP, diarrhoeal morbidity was taken as an intermediate outcome variable for measuring the impact of the proposed intervention. In this study 350-410 under-five children were selected from 200 urban families of 3 slums and surveyed during 3 different seasons for 2 weekly recall of morbidity, treatment and feeding practices during diarrhoea. The prevalence of diarrhoea varied between 8.7% to 33%. Breast feeding was not restricted while other forms of feeding was continued in 57.1% to 66.3% of cases. Use of ORT increased significantly from 0% to 39.62% possibly as a result of health education. Reorientation of private practitioners to avoid use of unnecessary drug is suggested. In 1988, researchers conducted an operations research study of an improved sanitation and water supply project which included health education in the slums of Sabari, Armanganj, and Katwaru Ka Pura in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh in India to examine diarrhea related practices.  Diarrhea prevalence was significantly higher in the rainy season than either the summer or winter months (32.3% vs. 12.9% and 8.65% respectively; p.001).  Drugs were used significantly more often in the rainy season (97.65%) than in the winter and summer months (67.86% and 81.63% respectively; p.001).  Private practitioners treated most cases of diarrhea regardless of the season (94.1% in rainy season, 53.6% and 75.5% in winter and summer months respectively).  On the other hand, government health facilities treated relatively few cases (3.5%, 17.9%, and 0 respectively).  Use of home available fluids increased significantly from 0-39.62% (p.001).  So did use of oral rehydration packets 2.7-32%; p.001).  The researchers accredited this improvement to educational activities.  Women tended to continue breastfeeding and giving other foods to children during diarrheal episodes.  Nevertheless there was room for improvement.  These results revealed the need for educational efforts to encourage caretakers to use home available fluids and oral rehydration solution and to reorient private practitioners to avoid using drugs and to use oral rehydration therapy. ","1679":"Two decades of research have established newer pathogens and techniques in establishing several organisms of diarrhoeal diseases as aetiological agents. It is now possible to detect an agent in 80% of the situation of diarrhoea in a standard laboratory. The brief review describes the list of pathogens, their diagnostic techniques with short description on clinical and epidemiological status. In the early 1980s, microbiologists could isolate the causative agent of diarrhea in only 20% of cases, but now they can isolate an agent in about 80% of cases.  Since then, they have identified more enteropathogens.  In fact, 25 enteropathogens cause disease.  Shigella species tend to afflict people in unhygienic areas with watery or mucoid diarrhea.  They tend to strike infants during weaning.  They often are resistant to several drugs, particularly nalidixic acid.  IN 1984, S. dynsenteriae type 1 struck people in West Bengal, Assam, and Orissa, India.  Salmonella species are other common agents of diarrhea.  Unlike Shigella species, the infective dose for Salmonella is rather small.  Food is the chief mode of transmission.  In the early 1990s, they were responsible for considerable diarrhea morbidity in parts of West Bengal.  birds carry Campylobacter, but person to person transmission occurs in nurseries.  Studies in Calcutta indicate considerable asymptomatic infection of C. jejuni in 5 year old children.  The enterotoxin of several types of Vibrio cholerae continues to cause outbreaks of profuse watery diarrhea.  Vibrio parahaemolyticus dwells in marine animals and infection favors adults.  In Calcutta, it is the 2nd most common health hazard and is present year round.  Different strains of Escherichia coli cause diarrhea including enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive, enterohemorrhagic, and enteroadherent E. coli..  A study published in 1984 indicates that, in Calcutta, enterotoxigenic E. coli was present in 12.1% of the feces of diarrhea patients from all age groups.  Yersinia and Aeromonas species are also bacteria which cause diarrhea.  Rotavirus is a common virus causing diarrhea.  In India, Manipur and Calicut experience rotavirus epidemics every winter.  Protozoans also cause significant diarrhea including Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, and Cryptosporidium species.

Commercial packets of ORS and the Government supplied packets of ORS are also assessed. The WHO Global Diarrhoeal Disease Control (CDD) Programme has been implemented in at least 110 member countries.  It encourages oral rehydration therapy (ORT) as the chief means to reduce child mortality caused by diarrhea.  Despite relatively high ORT access rates ORT (20%-70% in Africa and South East Asia respectively, 1989), oral rehydration solution (ORS) use is inadequate (12.1-26.7% Africa and Eastern Mediterranean respectively, 1988) as well as ORT use (19.2-39.8% Africa and Eastern Mediterranean respectively, 1988).   These poor results could be a factor of diminished knowledge and inadequate numbers of trained staff.  Yet 58 countries now produce ORS and worldwide production increased from 100-350 million 1 between 1983-1987.   In India, however, at least 75% of ORS brands do not meet WHO standards.  Further 0.5-1 million 5 year olds succumb annually due to diarrhea (25% of all deaths among 5 year olds).  In addition, about 500 million episodes of diarrhea occur each year.  ORT is required in 50-100 million of these episodes and hospitalization is needed for 5 million.  The Indian CDD program has reduced child mortality from diarrhea by 50% between 1981-1990.  It operates under a 3 tier strategy including home management with ORS, and hospital management with ORS and\/or IV fluids.  This strategy faces several obstacles.  For example, mothers in some villages do not know the village health guides who teach mothers how to make ORS.  Besides few are motivated at the village level to teach this to mothers.  According to government studies, ORT use varies in India from 36-96.3%, but according to operational research by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, ORT use in the  best health facilitate is only 11-12%. ","1681":"","1682":"Before 1970, laboratory staff could not only identify the causative organism of acute diarrhea in 20% of cases, but in 1990, they could identify it in 80% of cases.  These organisms are either bacteria, virus, or parasites.  The bacteria include enterotoxigenic bacteria (Vibrio cholerae, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus) and enteroinvasive bacteria (Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, and Salmonella and Shigella species).  The leading cause of death in diarrhea patients is dehydration.  Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) can alleviate mild and moderate dehydration regardless of the etiology of the diarrhea or the age of the patient.  WHO recommends an ORS containing glucose and various electrolytes which permit salt and water absorption in many cases of acute diarrhea.  Due to the possibility of excess salt entering the bloodstream (hypernatremia), some pediatricians do not use the WHO recommended ORS in newborns and young infants.  Instead they use 2 parts ORS followed by 1 part water.  This treatment is not easy for illiterate mothers to follow, however.  Continued breast feeding during diarrheal episodes along with administration of ORS protects not only against dehydration, but also hypernatremia.  ORS should not be administered in severe case of dehydration, however.  Medical personnel need to administer replacement fluid such as Ringer's Lactate solution intravenously regardless of the age group.  Once the initial deficit has been controlled, ORS administration and reintroduction of foods can follow.  Antibiotics should only be administered if the medical personnel suspect severe cholera in an endemic area (tetracycline and furazolidone); shigellosis, but 1st the bacteria must be tested to see if the strain is multiple drug resistant (ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, furazolidone, nalidixic acid), and acute amebiasis or giardiasis (metronidazole and tinidazole).  Antidiarrheals should not be used.","1683":"Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) prevents severe morbidity and death from mild to moderate dehydration from acute diarrhea for all ages and all etiologies.  WHO advises ORT fluid to contain 3.5 g sodium chloride, 3.5 g potassium chloride, 2.5 g sodium bicarbonate or 2.9 g trisodium citrate dihydrate, and 20 g glucose all dissolved in 1 1 of water.  This fluid does not reduce stool volume or frequency and does not curtail duration thus it is not always acceptable.  Improved ORT is needed, however.  The glucose concentration cannot be increased above the present 2% since an increased concentration would intensify diarrhea and dehydration.  Researchers are working on an improved solution (Super ORS) which would rehydrate the body and actively bring on reabsorption of endogenous secretions in the intestine.  Thus this improved ORS would reduce stool volume, shorten duration of diarrhea, and allow early introduction of feeding.  Even though some studies demonstrate that fortified ORS with the amino acid glycine decreases stool volume by 49-70% and duration of diarrhea 28-30%, other studies indicate that it induces excess sodium concentrations in the blood.  1 study demonstrates that in comparison with the standard ORS, ORS fortified with the amino acid L-alanine reduced the severity of symptoms and the need for fluid in patients afflicted with cholera and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.  Further studies reveal that rice powder based ORS (50-80 g\/l) reduces stool volume 24-49% and duration of duration 30%.  The advantage of using rice is that when it hydrolyzes glucose, amino acids, and oligopeptides emerge.  Each 1 of these chemicals facilitate sodium absorption through separate pathways.  Disadvantages include the fuel must be used to cook the rice, rice based ORS ferments within 8-24 hours making it useless, and the rice or pop rice needs to be ground.","1684":"An out break of acute bacillary dysentery in a village called Dhamasin in Hooghly district of West Bengal was investigated during March 1984. Forty seven percent of families were affected. A total of 91 cases and 2 deaths occurred amongst 937 people giving an over all attack rate of 9.7% and a case fatality rate of 2.2 percent. Highest attack rate (22.7%) was observed in below one year age group. Multiple drug resistant Shigella dysentery type 1 strains were isolated for the first time from 6 out of 22 cases sampled at the domiciliary level. The organism was never isolated earlier during last ten years of surveillance in the infectious Diseases Hospital, Calcutta. Identification of nature of this outbreak and it's causative agent helped to realise the potentiality of extensive spread and paved the way for further investigations. Public health authorities were buffled as the rapid spread of the disease throughout the entire state of West Bengal could not be contained in spite of instituting all probable control measures on war footing. In March 1984, epidemiologists investigated an outbreak of acute bacillary dynsentery (February 17-March 29) in Dhamasin village in Hooghly district in West Bengal, India.  47% of all families had at least 1 case.  Secondary cases occurred in 14 families.  Further a family of 10 family had 7 members fall ill.  91 of 937 people in Dhamasin acquired dysentery (attack rate=9.7%).  Children 12 months old suffered more than other age groups (attack rate=22.7%) and incidence fell with age.  The overall case fatality rate was 2.2%.  Number of stools ranged from 10-70\/day.  Unqualified local allopathic doctors or private practitioners treated most cases with at least 1 antibiotic.  Local health authorities did not begin control measures until March 20.  They treated all cases with oral rehydration solution and enteroquinol and thalazol.  Laboratory personnel isolated Shigella dysenteriae, especially type 1, in  31.8% of the 22 stool samples.  The next highest isolation rate (27.3%) was for S. shigae.  All S.  dysenteriae type 1 isolates demonstrated resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole.  They were sensitive to nalidixic acid, gentamicin, and kanamycin, however.  The investigators concluded that S. dynsenteriae was responsible for the epidemic.  The index case brought it into the village and it spread due to poor sanitation facilities, improper disposal of feces, and indiscriminate defecation.  In addition, village was experiencing a scarcity of drinking and domestic water.  Moreover flies which transmit Shigella were abundant.  The low infective dose required to induce illness further exacerbated the situation since event the best precautions could not prevent transmission. ","1685":"During the epidemic of bacillary dysentery at Agartala, Tripura, a total of 62 hospitalized patients suffering from diarrhoeal diseases were studied during the later part (11-16 June, 1988) of the epidemic. Principal features of Shigellosis cases were discussed. Of these 62 cases investigated, 19(30.6%) cases had the mucoid diarrhoea. From them S.dysenteriae type 1 and S.flexneri had been recovered from 31.6% and 10.5% cases, respectively. All the strains of S.dysenteriae type 1 isolated during the period of investigation were resistant to nalidixic acid. Physicians at the V.M. Hospital in Agartala in Tripura State in India treated 62 patients with dynsentery either in the outpatient department or in the wards.  30.6% had mucoid diarrhea.  Duration of diarrhea was 16 days for hospitalized cases and 8 for outpatient cases.  71.4% of all cases had 20 stools\/day.  Laboratory personnel isolated Shigella species in 43.5% of all cases.  29.03% tested positive for S. dysenteriae type 1.  The dry disc diffusion technique revealed that all S. dysenteriae type 1 isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol. streptomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and co-trimoxazole.  Further they were sensitive to furazolidone and gentamicin.  14.5% of cases tested positive for S.  flexneri.  All these isolates were sensitive to nalidixic acid, co-trimoxazole, gentamicin, and furazolidone.   92.6% of all cases had previously been treated with combinations of antibiotics, especially nalidixic acid, metronidazole, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and gentamicin.  Moreover 79.6% were treated with at least nalidixic acid.  The researchers did not know if mucoid diarrhea a new clinical form of shigellosis or a result of extensive use of antimicrobials before hospitalization.  They suspected that the nalidixic acid resistant S.  dysenteriae type 1 strains prolonged illness.  The researchers concluded more emphasis must be placed on personal hygiene since drug resistant strains of Shigella are becoming more common. ","1686":"Ninety six children upto the age of five years suffering from uncomplicated acute dysentery of less than 3 days' duration were studied to find out the impact of feeding of extra-protein rich diet during their acute phase of illness. These children were randomly allocated to either control group (receiving only hospital diet) and study group (receiving hospital diet and extra milk which constituted 30% of ideal total calorie requirement of patients. Patients in the two groups were comparable on admission. Forty percent reduced food intake was observed among the children of both the groups due to severe anorexia which was reflected by no significant differences in clinical outcome, anthropometrical measurements and haematological parameters between the two groups on day 7 of hospitalisation and on day 15 after discharge. Health practitioners admitted 96 7-25 month old children with uncomplicated acute dysentery to the Dr. B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children in Calcutta, India and randomly allocated them into either the group that received only the hospital diet (control group) or the group that received the hospital diet and extra milk (3.1 g of protein\/100 g milk) comprising 30% of ideal calorie requirement of the patient (case group).  They treated all the children with nalidixic acid (55 mg\/kg\/day).  They conducted this clinical study to examine the effect of an extra protein rich diet during the acute phase of dysentery.  37.5% of the patients tested positive for Shigella species.  No enteroinvasive pathogens were isolated from the remaining patients, however.  Food intake of both groups was 40% less than recommended intake.  Therefore it was difficult to give the food to the children.  No statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes, anthropometrical measurements, and hematological values existed on day 7 of hospitalization and day 15 after discharge between cases and controls.  Anorexia may have been responsible for the study's inability to demonstrate any advantage of increase protein in the diet.  Further this study was done in a hospital rather in the children's home where they may have been more willing to eat more food.  Yet children still had reduced food intake during the 2nd week of discharge from the hospital. ","1687":"Since diarrhea is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in India as well as in developing and developed countries, public health specialists strive to develop vaccines against various pathogens which cause diarrhea.  Rotavirus (RV) causes 20-40% of severe diarrhea among 6-24 month olds.  So they hope for a single dose vaccine against all 4 RV serotypes which can be administered to newborns, but such a vaccine does not yet exist.  The bovine and rhesus vaccines are the only heterologous candidate vaccines available, (as of the end of 1989).  Another candidate vaccine is the human-animal reassortant RV vaccine where scientists incorporate the VP7 surface protein of human RV into animal RV.  The 3rd type of RV candidate vaccine include the naturally attenuated human RV (nursery strains).  Vibrio cholerae also causes significant diarrhea in India.  Researchers have conducted field trials of many cholera vaccines since the mid 1990s, but they could not find a vaccine which could be used for mass vaccination against cholera.  In fact, the cholera vaccine currently used only provides 50% protection, lasts 3-6 months, does not affect carriers, and does not protect against all strains.  Salmonella typhi also causes diarrhea, especially among school age children and young adults.  The results of large scale field trials in the 1960s reveal that 2 doses of the acetone inactivated typhoid vaccine performed the best of the injectable killed whole cell vaccines.  In fact, it provides 79-93% protection and lasts 3-4 years.  Further the live oral Ty21a lyophilized vaccine reconstituted in a liquid form and given in multiple doses provides comparable protection (71-96%) against typhoid as well as some protection against paratyphoid.  Moreover they induce no side effects.  Shigella species also cause diarrhea, especially in children.  Various candidate vaccines against shigellosis include the spontaneously attenuated vaccines, streptomycin dependent vaccines, toxoid against exotoxins, and mutant hybrid strains.","1688":"","1689":"","1690":"Indices of child health status were compared for 2 British areas with similar population structure but different history of health education.

Most of their sexual contacts had been prostitutes, although some paid in meals or gifts rather than money. These young men also reported that they knew about sexual intercourse at the age of 14 (85%), and had their 1st experience between age 15 and 18 years old.

Retrospective data from these mothers were collected about their diet patterns during pregnancy. At least 3 home visits were made for each mother after her discharge from the hospital: the 1st visit within 7 days after discharge, the 2nd visit when the infant was 4-6 months old during the weaning period, and the 3rd visit when the infant was 8-12 months old. 60% of mothers were illiterate and 34% had up to primary level education, while only 4% and 2% of mothers had up to secondary and higher than secondary level education, respectively. None of the mothers was working. Only 13% of the families' daily diet was nonvegetarian. There was a wide gap between the mothers' attitude towards various nutritious food categories and the actual practice of consuming them because of the inability to buy those food items owing to poverty. When pregnant, they avoided leafy vegetables (96%) as well as brinjal, cauliflower, and cabbage (42%) for fear of gastric upset. 75% of mothers avoided pineapple and papaya; and 50% avoided fish since it was believed to cause scaly patches on the child's face and body. 76% of mothers, irrespective of their level of education or economic status, were consuming sago, barley, garlic, and turmeric in the erroneous belief of augmenting breast milk secretion.

Firstly, two related variables, like duration of antenatal care and birth-weight of newborn were significantly associated with incidence of neonatal morbidity. Apart from these, attributes like mother's educational status and per capita family income were also found as important factors determining occurrence of illness during neonatal period. Moreover, children of working mothers suffered more from illness. However, it should be pointed out here that majority of the attributes discussed here, such as, occupation, literacy, income etc, are inter-dependant. So, to quantify correctly the relative risk and attributable risk of these factors in causing childhood disease needs cohort study with matched control to neutralise the effects of confounding variables. Birth weight of newborns, as well as the socio-economics of antenatal care, have a direct relationship on neonatal morbidity.  Newborns were studied at district hospital, Chinsurah, in Houghly district (West Bengal) from September 1977-August 1978.  400 newborn infants were later followed up.  Mothers were interviewed regarding occupation, income, and obstetric history.  Babies were examined 24 hours after birth and birthweight was recorded after bath and cord dressing.  Neonates were visited weekly at home and detected for any signs of illness.  Morbidity was defined as any illness needing medical attention.  Of the 400 newborns studied 178 suffered from some illness during their neonatal period.  Results showed highest incidence of birth weight associated with neonatal morbidity was observed in neonates weighing less than 2,000 gms. (86.54%), and lowest among those weighing more than 3,000 gms. (20.59%).  Illness among neonates and duration of antenatal care received by mothers has an inverse relationship at 11.02%.  Also, illness was higher among infants of working mothers (68.99%), than mothers who were housewives (42.50%).  Neonatal illness was also distributed according to literacy of mothers with those groups highlighted:  children born to illiterate mothers (54.35%), mothers with primary education (42.37%), and mothers with secondary and above level education (32.94%).

In Pondicherry, the crude birthrate was 32.6\/1000 in 1978 and 25.9\/1000 in 1982.  When the age-specific fertility rates of the 2 years were compared, there was not remarkable difference except for the age group 15-19 years; the age-specific fertility rate was 405.0 in 1978 and 302.0 in 1982, a favorable trend.  The total fertility rate was 4.69 in 1978 and 4.28 in 1982.  In 1978, the crude rate of natural increase was 15.1; it dropped to 13.6 in 1982.

All of the 260 women surveyed at the health center were married; among the 175 teachers in training, 104 (59%) were married, 68 (39%) were single, and 3 (1%) were divorced.  The contraceptive prevalence rate was 20% among mothers attending the child health center compared with 53% among student teachers (72% among married teachers and 38% among single teachers).  Among future teachers, contraceptive awareness was higher among single women (49%) than married women (39%).  The predominant forms of contraception used by teacher trainees were the pill (22%), condom (18%), rhythm (13%), the IUD (115), Depo-Provera injections (115), and abstinence (8%).  The major sources of contraceptive awareness reported by these women were boyfriend (18%), sister (16%), nurse (14%), friend (13%), and television (13%).  29% of the teachers in training indicated they themselves had made the decision to use contraception, while 43% cited the influence of husband or boyfriend and 19% were motivated by medical personnel.","1793":"","1794":"The functions of public health journals, the titles of articles on relevant topics published by the Indian Journal of Public Health, and a brief summary of the history of this journal are included.

The questionnaire dealt with various aspects of weaning knowledge, attitudes, and practices.  The mothers were referred to the Nutrition Clinic because their babies already were suffering from protein energy malnutrition, had failed to thrive, or had severe infections, e.g., measles, gastroenteritis, or respiratory diseases.  58 (89.2%) of the families were of low socioeconomic status.  36 mothers (55.4%) introduced supplementary feeds to their babies between 4-6 months of life; 27 (41.5%) mothers introduced supplementary feeds when their children were between 7-9 months.  All the mothers used corn, guinea corn, or millet gruel.  A decision to wean a child may be made if the child can crawl, walk, or has a good set of erupted milk teeth, even if the child has not reached the traditional weaning age of 20-24 months.  The mean age of weaning was 17 months in this study.  51 (78.5%) of the mothers responded to the question about weaning food taboos, prohibitions, and their reasons during the weaning period.  Even when protein is available, a child may be denied the protein because of sociocultural factors.

In addition, seroconversion studies were carried out after 3 and 5 doses of oral polio vaccine.  The seroconversion rates for types 1, 2, and 3 polio were 63%, 75%, and 75%, respectively, after 3 doses and 89%, 94%, and 97%, respectively, after 5 doses.  Seroconversion rates were significantly higher in the winter than in the summer months.  Analysis of 1652 cases of polio in 1977-81 in which children had been vaccinated revealed an overall polio prevalence rate of 6.2\/1000 after the 1st dose, 3.2\/1000 after the 2nd dose, and 4.7\/1000 after the 3rd dose.  A further analysis of 36 serum samples collected from normal adults found that only 4 samples were negative to antibodies against all 3 types of polio virus.

At the time of the 1st dose, parents were educated about the importance of completing the series.  683 of the children were not returned for the 3rd dose, for a dropout rate of 33.7%.  The majority of dropouts (42.6%) were clustered in the 3-6 month age group.  There was a higher but nonsignificant dropout rate in females (35.4%) than in males (32.6%).  The dropout rate was lowest among children of birth order 1 (23.2%) and highest in birth order 5 (72.1%).  There was a statistically significant association between dropout rates and maternal occupational status; only 3.8% of children whose mothers were engaged in service occupations failed to complete the immunization series compared with 34.6% of those whose mothers were housewives.  In addition, there was a significant association with paternal occupation.  The maximum number of dropouts was noted among children whose fathers were laborers (51.2%) and the lowest rate was found among children of men in service occupations (23.6%).  Finally, there was a significant inverse relationship between parental education and dropout rates.  This relationship was most pronounced for maternal educational status.

Roy Polio Clinic and Hospital for Crippled Children in 1965-80.  Yearly statistics indicate a rising trend in the incidence of polio, with the lowest number of cases (522) encountered in 1966 and the highest number (2208) in 1979.  48% of patients attened the hospital in the acute stage of the disease and 10% were seen in the residual stage.  The cases came from virtually all the states of India, indicating polio's endemic characteristic.  An unexpected finding was that the polio cases were equally distributed between urban (50.03%) and rural (49.98%) areas.  The duration of illness was 1-30 days in 48% of cases, 31 days-2 years in 42% of cases, and over 2 years in another 10%.  Of interest was the observation of a uniform fluctuation (a peak followed by a lull) in alternate years.  It is speculated that, in the years with a higher disease incidence, the immunity status of the population improves from subclinical infection.  These findings point to a need for continuing emphasis on the prevention and control of poliomyelitis as well as proper surveillance and recording.","1836":"Oral polio vaccine was introduced into India's national immunization program in 1979-80.  Coverage with this vaccine has increased rapidly from 0.67 million in 1979-80 to 9.63 million in 1984-85.  3 doses of the vaccine are recommended at age 3-12 months, followed by a booster dose 12-18 months later.  The vaccine is administered along with the DPT vaccine.  The vaccines are provided as a package of services under the expanded program on immunization (EPI).  India's government initiated the EPI in 1978 with the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality due to diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever by making vaccination services available to all eligible children and pregnant women by 1990.  In 1985-86, measles vaccination was included in the program.  Another objective was to achieve self-sufficiency in the production of vaccines required for the program.  Immunization services are provided through the existing health care delivery system:  hospitals, dispensaries, and maternal and child health (MCH) clinics in the urban areas primary health centers in rural areas.  The aim of universal immunization for all India has been set for 1989-90; some areas may achieve this goal earlier.  30 districts and catchment areas of 50 medical colleges have been taken up in the universal immunization program for 1985-86.  The objectives of the universal immunization program include:  to provide universal immunization coverage to pregnant women and to infants; to document a reduction in the vaccine preventable diseases; to develop effective implementation and to streamline logistics; and to encourage the active participation of the medical faculty, interns, and students from the planning to the evaluation stages.  The government of India provides the vaccines required under the national immunization program to the state health authorities.  Over 50 million doses of oral polio vaccine are expected to be utilized during 1985-86.  The annual requirements are likely to exceed 80 million doses by 1989-90.  The planned targets of vaccination coverage are linked closely to the development of the cold chain system.  Since 1984 field samples of oral polio vaccine have been collected for potency tests in order to monitor the quality of the cold chain for vaccines.  The effectiveness of the control measures will be evaluated by determining the vaccination coverage of the eligible population and by recording the reduction in incidence of poliomyelitis in the area.","1837":"","1838":"Poliomyelitis, an acute infectious disease which chiefly affects the central nervous system, is included in the list of 20 communicable diseases which are to be reported monthly by all institutions to the State Bureau of Health Intelligence for onward transmission to India's Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI).  The reported number of 17,441 cases of poliomyelitis (annual average) since 1974 fail to reflect the magnitude of the problem in India.  Directorate General of Health Services (DHGS) in collaboration with the State health authorities organized sample lameness surveys of children 5-9 years in the community during 1981-82.  Poliomyelitis was found to be the major cause of lameness in children 5-9 years (64.5%).  Data on admission of poliomyelitis cases from selected hospital in metropolitan cities were collected.  All the hospitals reported maximum number of polio cases (more than 78%) below the age of 2 years.  This data reinforce the importance of improving vaccination coverage in the age group most affected.  High incidence of poliomyelitis (45% of the cases) were observed during July, August, and September, corresponding to the well demarcated monsoon season.  This suggests a need to intensify immunization coverage during the low polio incidence period, namely, November to April.  Polio vaccine was introduced in the national immunization program in 1980.  The schedule recommends 3 doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV), starting from the age of 3 months with intervals not less than 1 month.  DPT and polio vaccine are administered to the child at the same time.  1 booster dose of OPV is recommended 12-18 months later.  The live attenuated OPV, not produced in India is used in the national program.  The requirement of the program is met by import of bulk concentrated vaccine separately for type 1, type 2, and type 3.  Then, it is diluted, blended, and ampouled by Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation, Ltd.  The recent visit of Dr. Jonas Salk has raised the issue of introduction of killed polio vaccine (KPV) in the national program.  It now is claimed that 2 doses of KPV are adequate for protection, and this can be blended with DPT to make it a quadruple vaccine.  The many advantages of the live OPV used in the national program are listed, including:  confers both humoral and intestinal immunity like natural infection; immunity induced may be lifelong; induces antibody very quickly in a large proportion of vaccines; and oral administration is acceptable and easier to achieve.","1839":"","1840":"This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of residual poliomyelitis paralysis in children 5-15 years of age in Ajmer City, Rajasthan, India.  Household interviews focused on 6000 randomly selected children (3 clusters of 2000 children each).  Epidemiologic information was obtained and a physical examination was performed to determine the presence of lameness (defined as not being able to walk properly or having 1 leg shorter than the other).  Of the 148 children identified as having some type of orthopedic or neurologic defect, 104 had been affected by poliomyelitis.  The overall prevalence of lame children was 17.3\/1000, with the highest prevalence (89.55\/1000) in children 5 years of age. There was a significantly higher prevalence rate of polio paralysis in males (21.15\/1000) than females (13.06\/1000).  69% of the children had been affected by poliomyelitis below the age of 3 years and 92% had been affected below the age of 5 years.  46% of affected children were of the 1st or 2nd birth order.  Paralytic cases were most frequent in children from social class I, but social class differences were not significant.  Of the 6000 children surveyed, only 1162 (19.36%) had received oral polio vaccine.  Among children affected by residual polio paralysis, only 12 (11.52%) had been vaccinated prior to the onset of disease and none of these children had received the full course of vaccine.  These findings indicate that poliomyelitis is a major contributor to disease in children under 5 years of age in India and underscore the need for adherence to the complete schedule of polio immunization.","1841":"","1842":"","1843":"","1844":"","1845":"","1846":"","1847":"","1848":"","1849":"","1850":"","1851":"","1852":"","1853":"","1854":"","1855":"","1856":"","1857":"","1858":"","1859":"","1860":"","1861":"","1862":"","1863":"","1864":"","1865":"177 children ranging in age from 9-23 months were included in this study designed to obtain information on the feasibility of the immunization program against measles in the Singur Block of Hooghly district, about 34 miles from Calcutta, India.  111 children were administered the measles vaccine; 66 children served as the control group.  Special care was taken to exclude children who had illness suggestive of a previous attack of measles.  Children who had received any other vaccine in the previous month also were excluded.  Each child was checked within 7 days of the vaccination to record untoward reactions.  Home visits were done monthly.

Family planning services were provided at a hospital clinic located in the Jasara block.  A questionnaire was used to collect information from a sample of 500 couples.  91.4% of the respondents were Hindu, 98.5% were uneducated, and the modal age of the sample was 20-30 years.  The average number of children ever born to the respondents was 3.66, and the mean child loss was 0.54\/couple.  25 couples had no children.  The mean age at marriage for the women was 14.58 years, and parity decreased as marriage age increased.  Among couples married 1-5 years, the mean number of children was 1.7, and among couples married 25 years or more, the mean number of children was 5.6.  Women between the ages of 25-29 years had 3.67 children, and those over 40 years of age had 5.59 children.  310 couples lived in nuclear families, and the remaining couples lived in joint families.  The average number of children decreased as the educational level of the father increased.  Parity was higher among low income groups than among moderate income groups.  68% of the fathers were cultivators, 22% were agricultural laborers, and 9% were service workers.  No differences in parity were observed for the occupational groups.  The mean number of children among Muslim couples was 4.8, 3.7 among Hindus belonging to lower castes, and 3.1 among Hindus belong to upper castes.  Social class was not related to parity.  Only 52% of the couples ever used contraception.  36% of the 500 couples ever used condoms, 8.2% relied on tubectomies, and 5.4% ever used oral contraceptive (OCs) or IUDs.  Condom use was equally distributed among different educational groups.  30% of couples with high school educations and 4% of the illiterate couples used sterilization.  Couples with low incomes were more likely to use condoms, and couples with higher incomes were more likely to use sterilization.  Couples in the lower and upper income groups were more likely to practice contraception than couples in the middle income group.  Most of the women who had tubectomies had 3-4 children.  There is a need to promote temporary methods among younger couples.  Many couples, and especially illiterate couples, are concerned about the side effects of OCs and IUDs.  They tend to use condoms until they are ready to accept sterilization.  Efforts should be made to educate couples about the benefits of OCs and IUDs and to overcome their fear of these methods.","1867":"","1868":"","1869":"The utilization of the maternal health care services offered by an upgraded primary health care (PHC) facility in a rural area of West Bengal, India was assessed.

Women in 58% of the families used the prenatal services of the facility, 6% received prenatal care from private practitioners, and 36% received no prenatal care.  Reasons given for not using the facility were 1) using the clinic was too time consuming, 2) the staff was unfriendly, 3) a lack of interest in the services provided.  There was no significant differences between prenatal service utililizers and nonuser in regard to caste differences.  Utilizers were somewhat more likely to live in households with a literate household head than nonusers.  The number of visits made by the utilizers ranged from 1-5, but many respondents had difficulty recalling the exact number.  Utilizers were no more likely than nonusers to use the delivery services of the PHC.

Hemoglobin estimation was repeated every month.  The regularity of intake was ensured by the MCH staff and women who consumed up to 75% of the period were considered as regular.  Most of the women receiving iron supplementation were between 21-30 years of age, accounting for 62.6%.  29.2% of the women were under age 20.  51.5% were registered in their 2nd trimester and 1\/3 in the 1st trimester.  14.6% were registered as late as the 3rd trimester.  Only 9.4% had normal hemoglobin levels; the remaining 90.6% were anemic, 83% mild to moderate anemia and 7.6% severe anemia.  The prevalence was highest in the 2nd trimester, in which 95.8% of the women were anemic.  The prevalence was marginally lower in 1st and 3rd trimester, being 86.2% and 88.9%.

Modern public health measures are facing a difficult situation because of population growth.  In regard to population structure, 2 age groups have been a concern of the health services, namely those 0-15 years and those 65 and older.  The child's group constituted 42-44% of the total population, now reduced to 38.2% in 1982 and is a heavy dependent group particularly if another contingent of 20.4% in the 15-24 age group and requiring education is added.  With an increasing life expectancy, there is now more than a 6% accumulation of aged persons in need of support.  The Indian Council of Medical Research has established a National Institute of Nutrition and a Food and Drug Technology Center at Hyderabad, both of which have been doing useful work on nutrition and food technology.  Both the history of public health during the last 100 years and all recent studies and observations amply demonstrate the dominant role played by the environment in the development of physical health and well-being of individuals and the community.  The majority of iillnesses in a rural setting arise from 3 situations--pollution of water, soil, and air.  A serious consequence of uncontrolled use of insecticides has been the health problems arising out of their toxic effects on persons handling them and on the people consuming contaminated foodstuff.  Another effect on the health services is the increasing conversion of the vector insects to resistant form.  In the field of communicable diseases the problems are vast and varied in India.  For tackling all diseases a need exists for training courses to produce field epidemiologists.  Among the noncommunicable diseases there is a definite rising trend in cancer, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, mental disorders, peptic ulcer, allergic disorders, rheumatic conditions, lung cancer, and leukemia.  Another cause of morbidity and mortality which are assuming serious proportions is accident and deaths due to violence.  India has undertaken to expand maternal and child health services and to establish new services where none exist.  Every state has established a Family Planning Training Institute and created clinics throughout.  Knowledge about the mental health conditions in India is generally poor as few surveys have been carried out to collect the information.  Following the 2nd 5-year plan, industries are being rapidly developed in the country both in public and private sectors.  Most of the problems can be solved to a great extent by mobilizing all medical and health personnel and services into 1 integrated service, but it is not considered feasible at this time.  A concerted effort to rethink and reorganize present health services is required.","1909":"An attempt was made to examine the factors affecting the acceptance of family planning practices among rural women clientele in India.

The adoption of family planning practice was measured by the adoption index of Singh (1975).  The socioeconomic status scale was used to quantify the variables such as education, family size, family type, caste, farm size, occupation, and social participation.  The majority of the respondents had medium and low levels of adoption of family planning (45% each), and only 10% had a high level of adoption of family planning.  The relationship of independent variables and variability caused by these in the adoption behavior of rural women was established by using correlation and multiple regression analysis techniques.  The rural women's education, occupation, household material possession, information source utilization, knowledge and attitude towards the family planning practices were found to be positively and significantly related to the level of adoption of family planning practices.  Age, caste, family size, social participation, urban contact, land holding, family type and agricultural material possession were found to be nonsignificant.  Respondents with low formal education, involved in labor occupation, low household material possession, and low level of knowledge adopted family planning to a lesser extent, but rural women with a favorable attitude showed an upward trend of adoption of family planning.","1910":"","1911":"","1912":"","1913":"","1914":"","1915":"","1916":"","1917":"","1918":"","1919":"","1920":"","1921":"","1922":"","1923":"","1924":"","1925":"","1926":"","1927":"","1928":"","1929":"","1930":"","1931":"","1932":"","1933":"","1934":"","1935":"","1936":"","1937":"","1938":"","1939":"","1940":"","1941":"","1942":"","1943":"The objective of this discussion is to determine how much India's fertility decline has occurred due to acceptance of all birth control methods combined and separately over the 1965-75 period.  Age distribution of the conventional contraceptive users was assumed to be the same as that of IUD acceptors, and it was also assumed that the age distribution of sterilization acceptors, IUD users, and conventional contraceptives remains constant over the 1965-75 period.  Fertility of the acceptors was taken as the same as that of nonacceptors.  Wife's age was 5 years less than that of her husband.  Level of mortality over the 1955-75 period was assumed to be constant.  Use effectiveness of sterilization was 100%, IUD, 95% and conventional contraceptives 60%.  The procedure for obtaining the annual performance of reduction in fertility level due to the family planning program involved 3 steps:  estimation of the number of couples currently protected due to the practice of various family planning methods; conversion of all the currently protected couples into standard couples; and calculation of percentage of standard couples protected and percentage of reduction in birthrate.  It was observed that the standard couples protected by the family planning program in the early reproductive age group were less, where the fertility rate was high as compared to the older age group.  In the case of sterilization the percentage reduction in birthrate, during the 1st few years after 1965 was not so much, but the percentage reduction was significant as the program gained momentum from 1968-73.  The percentage reduction in birthrate due to sterilization was as follows:  1966-67, 2.049; 1967-68, 2.660; 1968-69, 4.657; 1969-70, 6.289; 1970-71, 7.509; 1971-72, 8.524; 1972-73, 10.280; 1973-74, 13.037; 1974-75, 13.221; and 1975, 13.823.  A cause for the IUD decrease from year to year might be the inadequate follow-up care after insertion.  Overall, the number of standard couples protected by the family planning program indicated that the program had reduced the birthrate by 17.97% in 1975 against 3.404% in 1966.","1944":"An attempt was made to study the sociodemographic characteristics of tubectomy acceptors in a rural community of West Bengal (Singur), India from 1960-76.  The study was conducted during the 1975-77 period in the service area of the Rural Health Unit and Training Center, Singur, the field practice area of the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health in Calcutta.  There were 1326 tubectomies recorded in the area from 1960-76.  They were divided into 3 groups based on their period of operation, i.e., 1960-72 as Group A, 1973-75 as Group B, and 1976 as Group C.  A 33.3% random sample was drawn from each group.  439 cases were drawn in the sample, of which 401 cases (91.1%) could be interviewed through a structured, pretested schedule.  It was observed that disproportionately fewer Muslim women than Hindu women chose to have a tubectomy.  Muslims constituted 11% of the total population in the area, whereas only 0.8% in Group A, 1.3% in Group B, and 1.2% in Group C were Muslims.  Although the proportion of scheduled caste\/tribe population in the area remained more or less constant around 23%, the tubectomy acceptance rate increased from 2.9% in Group A to 19.8% in Group C.  This was a statistically significant difference.  The illiteracy rate among the females in the area was 64%.  The proportion of illiterates among the tubectomy acceptors was 67.4% in Group A and 61.7% in Groups B and C.  Acceptance of tubectomy among the agricultural laborers increased from 21.9% in Group A to 30.9% in Group C, showing an overall increase of 9% over the years.  The mean age at marriage among acceptors increased from 14.7 in earlier years to 15.2 and 15.4 in recent years.  The average number of live births declined from 5.3 to 4.4 and 4.3 in recent years.  None of the couples in Group B, only 0.4% of the couples in Group A, and 3.7% of couples in Group C accepted sterilization as a birth control method without a male child.  The majority accepted tubectomy when they had at least 1 male child.  55.6% of acceptors in Group C were operated within 10 days of delivery compared to 35.5% in Group A and 30.8% in Group C.  The average family size of the acceptors was higher than the national average, i.e., 7.04 in Group A, 6.47 in Group B, and 6.55 in Group C.  92.8% of the acceptors had 3 or more living children of whom 43.2% already had 5 or more children.  It appears that tubectomy will fail to have much effect on population growth unless mothers are motivated to accept sterilization with a smaller number of living children.","1945":"","1946":"","1947":"","1948":"","1949":"","1950":"","1951":"","1952":"","1953":"","1954":"","1955":"","1956":"","1957":"","1958":"","1959":"","1960":"","1961":"","1962":"","1963":"","1964":"","1965":"","1966":"","1967":"","1968":"Information on the smoking and drug use habits of all 705 students who were accepted by the 8 medical schools in West Bengal, India, in 1979 was obtained from the students when they presented for their required preadmission physical exams between October and December, 1979.  The students were assured of the confidentiality of their responses.  90.1% of the students (557 males and 148 females) were between 17-20 years of age.  Among the males, 14.4% tried smoking 1 or a few cigarettes in the past.  Only 3.2% of the males were current smokers.  None of the current smokers smoked more than 10 cigarettes a day, and 72.2% smoked 5 or fewer cigarettes\/day.  4 (0.7%) of the males currently used habit forming drugs at least once a week.  3 used alcohol and 1 used cannabis.  8 (1.4%) had infrequently used drugs in the past.  None of the females reported current or past use of cigarettes or habit forming drugs.  Students from urban areas were significantly more likely to smoke or use drugs than students from rural areas.  Prevalence rates for smoking and drug use were higher among students from families with incomes of Rs.2000 or more than among students from families with lower incomes.  The educational status of fathers was not related to the smoking and drug use habits of the students.  The study confirmed that very few entering students are habituated to drugs or cigarettes.  These findings agree with those of an earlier study of medical students in Calcutta which found that drug use increased as time spent in medical school increased.  Seniors were more likely to use drugs than juniors.","1969":"","1970":"","1971":"","1972":"","1973":"","1974":"The authors present a study of mortality in Pune cantonment, India, which had a population of around 78,000 in 1971.

The impact of the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis on the family planning practices of 367 male and 290 female patients at a treatment clinic in Aligarh District was assessed.  Prior to diagnosis only 10% of the patients practiced contraception, after diagnosis 19% practiced contraception, and after disease stabilization 29.5% practiced contraception.  Among those patients who began practicing contraception after diagnosis, about 1\/2 were motivated to practice by their physicians, and the remaining patients were motivated to practice either for economic reasons or because they feared spreading the infectious disease to an infant.  About 2\/3 of the tuberculosis patients had 3 or more children, and about 90% belonged to the lower socioeconomic class.  Among female patients, disease onset occurred for 49.7% within 1 year of childbirth, and for 29.3%, it occurred during pregnancy.  These findings suggested that an increase in the acceptance of family planning among members of the lower class and among high parity women would contribute toward decreasing the incidence of tuberculosis in the country.  Clients who practiced contraception were also more likely to attend the tuberculosis treatment clinic on a more regular basis than non-practicing clients.","1976":"","1977":"218 pregnant and lactating women were interviewed in an effort to determine patterns of care during pregnancy and lactation.

Most of the women were of low socioeconomic status, and around 50% had poor housing conditions and an unsafe water supply.  The majority of the women had obtained antenatal services, but domiciliary deliveries by untrained midwives or by their own relatives were common.  74.3% of the women were mainly on a cereal diet; 25.7% had cereals with plenty of milk during pregnancy.  The average calorie intake was 1605; the protein intake was 56 grams per head.  The caloric intake was less as compared to recommended allowances, but the protein was adequate.  During early lactation it was common practice to eat Achwani and Sithora.  17.5% of the women had no knowledge of family planning methods; 67.9% had knowledge but did not practice family planning.","1978":"","1979":"","1980":"","1981":"","1982":"","1983":"","1984":"","1985":"The authors attempt to evaluate the impact of the Indian family planning program on a population of around 56,000 in Harsola Indore, Madhya Pradesh, using data from a sample of 472 households with a population of about 3,000.

In order to determine the knowledge and attitude of medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) acceptors towards abortion and their pre and post abortion contraceptive practices, a study was conducted during January to December 1975 in a family planning clinic in North Calcutta.  300 consecutive cases admitted to the hospital for abortions were the study subjects - the MTP group.  They were subjected to repeated interviews in the ward before and after the abortion and were followed up at home within 6-10 months after the discharge from the hospital.  300 women who attended the antenatal clinic of the same hospital during the same period were selected for comparison by systematic sampling.  There is no statistically significant difference in the social characteristics of the 2 groups except that the MTP group was from a comparatively poorer economic class.  13.3% of the MTP group had \"good\" knowledge of physiology of reproduction in contrast to only 5.0% in the comparison group.  Only 52% of the MTP group and 63% in the comparison group failed to have even an \"average\" knowledge of this area.  Nearly 55% of the MTP group and 65% of the comparison group had never practiced family planning.  Over 55% of the MTP group had poor knowledge about abortion;  the most important soruce of their knowledge was their neighbors.  78.7% of the cases considered MTP to be a sinful act.  The primary reason for deciding to have an abortion was socioeconomic.  Over 27.6% of the cases were using contraceptives to avoid the present pregnancy.  The difference is statistically significant suggesting a positive learning effect of MTP on contraceptive behavior of women seeking abortions.","2038":"","2039":"","2040":"","2041":"","2042":"","2043":"","2044":"","2045":"","2046":"","2047":"","2048":"","2049":"","2050":"","2051":"","2052":"","2053":"","2054":"","2055":"","2056":"","2057":"","2058":"","2059":"","2060":"","2061":"","2062":"","2063":"","2064":"","2065":"","2066":"","2067":"","2068":"","2069":"","2070":"","2071":"","2072":"","2073":"","2074":"","2075":"","2076":"","2077":"","2078":"A stochastic model describing a woman's experience with an IUD was developed to assess the effectiveness of IUD as a contraceptive measure.

S1 = a woman on IUD;  S2 = a woman not on IUD because of personal reasons or side effects;  R = death state.  A woman whether on IUD or not, is in state R when she dies either in state S1 or S2.  Termination of IUD was attributed to pregnancy, expulsion, bleeding, and pain.  Except for a planned pregnancy, a woman's transition from state S1 to S2 implied failure of IUD as a contraceptive method.  To assess the efficacy of IUD, a formula for average duration of stay of IUD was derived.

Instead of using coercion, research in specific regions, sub-regions, and local areas should assess feasibility in light of knowledge, attitude, and practice of birth control, and rational goals should be set.  Health conditions, particularly of mother and child, are an important approach to fertility and family size.  As long as the morbidity of infants is high, the motivation for small family size will be low.  Women's education generally should be improved.  Later age at marriage also contributed to small family size.  Present population policy should be expanded to include a broad-based socioeconomic approach with a social security program.  Development through improved agricultural and marketing conditions will distribute the economic benefits for and improve the welfare of the most backward people.

Management is the process of planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, and controlling people, materials, machines and money in order to realize the optimum achievement of the program objectives.  The family planning program should be reviewed as a system.  Decisions made in the various sub-systems of the family planning system should be made in such a way that the various sub-systems act in a coordinated manner to achieve the overall program objective.  The approach of the current family planning program is trial and error. In order to make the family planning workers more committed and motivated, the program should be planned at the micro level on the basis of 2 management principles -- participation and decentralization.  Various management principles may be used to plan a family planning system.  The principles of marketing can be effectively utilized.  Evaluation should be a built-in process of the program.
