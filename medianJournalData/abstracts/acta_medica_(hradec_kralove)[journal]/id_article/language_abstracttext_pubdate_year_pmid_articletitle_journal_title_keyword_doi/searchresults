with orally administered ibandronate is an effective way to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce fracture rate in post-menopausal women and in men with osteoporosis. There are only very few reports concerning ibandronate therapy in children and adolescents, and in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), as bisphosphonates are not registered for therapeutic use in pediatrics. We present three patients with OI, where once-monthly oral ibandronate increased spinal BMD after two and four years, respectively, of therapy without any occurrence of new fractures and no adverse reactions. Somatic growth was not affected by the ibandronate treatment. Once-monthly oral ibandronate increased BMD and most probably improved bone quality in young patients with OI. ","1":null,"2":"Spindle cell lipoma (SCL) is an uncommon histological variant of lipoma that accounts for 1.5% of all adipose tumors. It rarely occurs in the oral cavity. The most common sites of involvement are the buccal mucosa, tongue, lip, alveolar mucosa, gingiva, and palate. Submandibular space is a very rare site of occurrence for SCL. When occurs in this site, SCL mainly involves the 4th-7th decade with a female predominance. Due to wide communications of submandibular space, the actual extent and appearance of the lesions present here gets masked up especially those involving the deeper tissues leading to an inaccurate diagnosis. Wide overlap of clinical and histopathological features of SCL to other clinical pathologies leads to a challenging task for the clinicians to reach an accurate diagnosis. To our knowledge, only four cases of intraoral SCL involving the submandibular region directly or indirectly have been reported in the literature. Here we represent another rare case of SCL in an 18-year-old male patient along with a concise review of the literature. This case appears to be quite rare due to its location (submandibular space), age, and sex of the patient (18\/M).","3":"Temporal bone chondroblastoma is a rare, locally aggressive tumour originating from immature cartilage, which recurs to a high degree. Treatment is surgical. Radiotherapy is reserved for recurrence. We describe a case of a 15-year-old-boy choosing a conservative surgical approach with reconstruction of the posterior canal wall. This study aims to report a rare pediatric case. A literature review was performed to better understand temporal bone chondroblastomas, to describe their histopathological and radiological characteristics and to establish the optimal surgical and non-surgical treatments. The research of previous published data was done using PubMed with keywords mentioned below. Authors present a case of a 15-year-old boy with hearing impairment and facial nerve palsy. Conservative surgery with reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and posterior wall of the external auditory canal, restoring the hearing has been performed. We did not administer any adjuvant therapies. No sign of recurrence was observed 1 year after primary surgery. Facial nerve function is normal, and hearing is satisfactory. Chondroblastomas account for less than 1% of primary bone tumours. Temporal bone chondroblastoma is rare, locally aggressive, with a high prevalence of recurrence. This study describes specific histopathological and radiological findings, the chosen surgical approach and follow-up to improve the management and the prognosis of patients affected with this particular clinical entity. ","4":"Appendiceal mucocele is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.07-0.63% of all appendectomies and was first described in 1842 by Carl von Rokitansky. It is defined as an abnormal intraluminal accumulation of mucin. The clinical picture of AM can vary from asymptomatic mass in the right lower quadrant to symptoms of acute appendicitis. In some cases, AM can be found accidentally on CT performed due to other reasons or during surgery. Diagnosis consists mainly of imaging methods such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI with the finding of encapsulated cystic mass with calcifications. The main goal of surgical treatment is to remove an intact mucocele and prevent spillage of mucin into the peritoneal cavity. We present a case of large mucocele treated with laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.","5":null,"6":"The inflammatory process in Crohn's disease (CD) is closely associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species. Antioxidant enzymes can play an important role in the outcome of CD and may influence postoperative recurrence in these patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate gene expression of intracellular antioxidant enzymes in surgically resected intestinal specimens of patients with CD, both in macroscopically normal and in inflamed tissue. A total of 28 patients referred for elective bowel resection were enrolled in the study. Full-thickness small intestinal specimens were investigated. Gene expression of antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GSR) - was evaluated both in macroscopically normal and inflamed samples. There were significantly lower levels of SOD1 mRNA (p = 0.007) and GSR mRNA (p = 0.027) in inflamed tissue compared to macroscopically normal areas. No significant differences were found between affected and non-affected intestinal segments in mRNA for SOD2, SOD3 and GPX. Our pilot data clearly showed that the gene expression of major antioxidant enzymes is not a uniform mechanism in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Topically decreased gene expression of SOD1 and GSR might facilitate the segmental tissue injury caused by reactive oxygen species. ","7":"The comparison of neuroprotective and central reactivating effects of the oxime K870 in combination with atropine with the efficacy of standard antidotal treatment in tabun-poisoned rats. The neuroprotective effects of antidotal treatment were determined in rats poisoned with tabun at a sublethal dose using a functional observational battery 2 h and 24 h after tabun administration, the tabun-induced brain damage was investigated by the histopathological evaluation and central reactivating effects of oximes was evaluated by the determination of acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain using a standard spectrophotometric method. The central reactivating efficacy of a newly developed oxime K870 roughly corresponds to the central reactivating efficacy of pralidoxime while the ability of the oxime HI-6 to reactivate tabun-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in the brain was negligible. The ability of the oxime K870 to decrease tabun-induced acute neurotoxicity was slightly higher than that of pralidoxime and similar to the oxime HI-6. These results roughly correspond to the histopathological evaluation of tabun-induced brain damage. The newly synthesized oxime K870 is not a suitable replacement for commonly used oximes in the antidotal treatment of acute tabun poisonings because its neuroprotective efficacy is only slightly higher or similar compared to studied currently used oximes. ","8":null,"9":"Warfarin is widely used anticoagulant drug for a variety of diseases (thromboembolic disease, atrial fibrillation, etc.). It has three most important parallel metabolic pathways, CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Terbinafine is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor. A possible drug interaction could lead to an increased pharmacological effect of the above drugs. Enzyme induction with CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP1A2 inducers may have occurred. Case report: We present a case report of an 88-year-old male patient who has been successfully anticoagulated with warfarin due to atrial fibrillation. He was orally administered terbinafine to treat onychomycosis. Two weeks after initiation of this drug the patient experienced dizziness and feelings of instability, for which he was admitted to the neurology department. A low-efficient INR level was found at the baseline, presumably due to warfarin interaction with terbinafine. The induction of liver enzymes lasts 10-14 days, which matches the introduction of the antifungal agent. Conclusion: Combined therapy with warfarin and oral terbinafine is actually rarely prescribed but, if used, their interaction can have serious consequences in many clinical situations for which anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is indicated.","10":"In the current study, we display a rare association of an aberrant innervation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle by the ansa cervicalis (AC) with a tortuous common carotid artery (TCCA). In specific, in a male cadaver we observed on the right side of the cervical region, a nerval branch of remarkable size originating from the most distal part of the AC's superior root and after piercing the superior belly of the omohyoid muscle innervated the distal portion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Furthermore, we noticed a tortuous course of the initial part of the right common carotid artery. We discuss the surgical significance of the awareness of AC's variations during neurotisation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in cases of its damage, as well as the importance of aberrant innervation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle by AC for the preservation of muscle's functionality after accessory nerve's damage. Furthermore, we highlight the fact, that the knowledge of the relatively uncommon variant, such as TCCA is crucial for the physician in order to proceed more effectively in differential diagnosis of a palpable mass of the anterior cervical region or deal with symptoms such as dyspnea, dysphagia or symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency.","11":"Hepatolithiasis is a benign disease, where stones are localized proximal to the confluence of hepatic ducts. The clinical picture may differ depending on whether the stones cause complete, partial, or intermittent biliary obstruction. The course can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, thus, early diagnosis and treatment is critical for a good prognosis. The gold standard in imaging is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). However, correct diagnosis can be challenging due to atypical clinical picture and laboratory findings. We present a case where hepatolithiasis was misdiagnosed initially due to incomplete reporting and documentation of MRCP. Choledocholithiasis was diagnosed based on initial MRCP, and endoscopic stone extraction was indicated. However, an unusual post-interventional course and signs of obstructive cholangitis led to an endoscopic re-intervention, which confirmed absence of pathology in extrahepatic biliary ducts. The cholangitis recurrence required intensive antibiotic treatment, and CT examination revealed intrahepatic S3 bile duct dilatation. Thus, a re-evaluation of initial MRCP and repeated MRCP confirmed hepatolithiasis. Further, laparoscopic bisegmentectomy was chosen as the definitive treatment due to the location of the lesion. The patient recovered and remained symptom free upon a 12 month follow up.","12":"The reference values of young athletes for cardiopulmonary exercise testing are lacking. Expert opinions encourage production of local values specific for certain population. The study population consisted of 136 healthy male caucasian athletic children and adolescents coming from one specific football school in northern Slovakia. Exercise testing with continuous electrocardiography was performed, and ventilatory parameters, oxygen uptake (VO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) production were measured continuously with a respiratory gas analysis system. Peak VO2max\/kg was changing very little across the childhood, whereas the peak work rate, heart rate and O2Pulse were. Linear regression analysis showed a significant effect of age on VE\/VCO2. This work provides a reference values for the most important cardiopulmonary variables that can be obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing in athletic children. ","13":"This study proceeds to rigorously examine and validate the Low Vision Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (LVQOL) on a Greek population of ophthalmic patients employing Rasch measurement techniques. It is a prospective observational study of 150 cataract patients and 150 patients with other ophthalmic diseases, all followed longitudinally for a period of two months pending surgical or other corrective therapy, after which they were administered the LVQOL for a second time. The original 25-item LVQOL demonstrated high reliability and validity, excellent measurement precision and ordered response category thresholds. A small number of items carry an acceptable level of measurement error while three items had some differential functioning for gender, Age and underlying disorder that did not exceed the established thresholds. This validation study is the first to employ Rasch measurement to examine the validity of the LVQOL and it supports its use with no changes to the original structure. The LVQOL can be employed in a large range of ophthalmic diseases and reliably assess improvements in quality-of-life following phacoemulsification surgery or any other intervention. ","14":"Iatrogenic mandible fracture is a rare complication of a tooth extraction with an incidence between 0.0033-0.0034%. This study retrospectively analyzes a total of 8 patients who underwent lower molar extraction associated with mandible fracture during tooth removal in the period from April 2006 to March 2019. The assessed parameters were age and sex of patients, method of tooth extraction, side distribution of fracture, type of extracted tooth, the position of a lower third molar, presence of bone pathological lesion formed in connection with a tooth, displacement of bone fragments, and sensory impairment in the innervation area of the mental nerve. The position and impaction of the lower third molars were evaluated according to Pell and Gregory's classification and Winter's classification. One fracture was left-sided, and 7 fractures were right-sided. In 6 cases, Winter's extraction elevator was used. In 7 patients, the mandible fracture was treated surgically by performing stable osteosynthesis with the plates and screws. One patient was treated conservatively. This work analyzes the causes of iatrogenic mandible fractures and provides recommendations to reduce the risk of their occurrence.","15":"This study deals with detecting the associations of atopic dermatitis' (AD) phenotypes in children: alone or combined with seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (SARC) and\/or perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR), and\/or with bronchial asthma (BA) with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of filaggrin (FLG), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and orsomucoid-like-1 protein 3 (ORMDL3) genes. Male and female pediatric patients aged from 3 to 18 years old were recruited into the main (AD in different combinations with SARC, PAR, BA) and control groups (disorders of digestives system, neither clinical nor laboratory signs of atopy). Patients were genotyped for SNP of rs_7927894 FLG, rs_11466749 TSLP, rs_7216389 ORMDL3 variants. Statistically significant associations of the increased risk were detected of AD combined with SARC and\/or PAR and AD combined with BA (possibly, SARC and\/or PAR) with C\/T rs_7927894 FLG and T\/T rs_7216389 ORMDL3 genotypes. Genotype C\/C rs_7927894 FLG significantly decreases the risk of AD combined with SARC and\/or PAR by 2.56 fold. Several genotypes' associations had a trend to significance: C\/C rs_7216389 ORMDL3 decreases and C\/T rs_7216389 ORMDL3 increases the risk for developing AD alone phenotype; A\/G rs_11466749 TSLP decreases the risk of AD combined with BA (possibly, SARC and\/or PAR) phenotype development.","16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":"Caries incidence and prevalence have decreased significantly over the last few decades due to widespread use of fluoride. However, an increase in the prevalence of dental fluorosis has been reported in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. Care must be taken to ensure that a balance between the optimal fluoride preventive effect at the individual and community level and minimal risk of dental fluorosis is maintained. This review describes the main sources of fluoride intake that have been identified: fluoridated drinking water, dietary fluoride supplement, and topical forms comprising toothpastes, rinses, gels and varnishes. The cited data were taken from meta-analytic studies and reports from Cochrane database systematic reviews up to December 2019. Efficiency, but safety, of topically applied fluorides in individual home care is dependent on the degree of compliance of individuals\/parents and on the level of competence of providers of preventive counselling. The broad spectrum of these resources allows individualization of fluoride prevention based on risk analysis of caries attack and taking into consideration other preventive measures.","20":"This is a case report describing a patient with severe thyroid eye disease complicated with dysthyroid optic neuropathy that was unresponsive to intravenous steroids and orbital radiotherapy but responded well to intravenous tocilizumab.","21":"The cases of horseshoe kidney presented by xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis are very rare. In this study, the case of XGP developing in HSK in a young female patient was presented due to its rare incidence and the previously reported cases were reviewed, as well. The patient, who has end-stage renal disease and was under treatment, admitted to the clinic for preemptive kidney transplantation. Bilateral open en bloc nephrectomy was performed before the kidney transplantation. The histopathological examination of the specimen was reported as XGP. Eight months later, living-donor organ transplantation was performed to the patient with the kidney obtained from her father. XGP can present as a complication of HSK. Moreover, HSK may rarely be manifested by end-stage renal disease in young patients. In such cases, who would undergo kidney transplantation, it is important to examine the HSK in detail and perform bilateral nephrectomy to prevent complications after transplantation.","22":"Peritoneal pseudocysts (PPs) in patients who are diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD), is a rarely diagnosed entity with unknown epidemiology, etiology and pathogenesis. We present the case of a 30-year old male with known CD who presented with an acute abdomen because of a PP. PPs are developed as a complication caused in patients, suffering from mainly thee conditions. Firstly, PPs appear in patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), they are also developed in patients with peritoneal trauma and finally in CD patients. Our case belongs to these three reported cases in our literature review, since it refers to a CD patient that developed PPs. He underwent emergency laparotomy and excision of the cyst, with good postoperative results. A literature review of 22 publications show that PPs often represent a diagnostic and therapeutic problem as it has a variable presentation and there are no data on what the best treatment option is - surgical excision or aspiration.","23":"Insulin autoimmune syndrome or Hirata's disease is an extremely rare condition leading to hypoglycaemia of variable severity due to autoantibodies against insulin.

However, these are possible sequalae of necrotizing pancreatitis and should be treated appropriately to prevent serious septic complications. We demonstrate a case of a 56-year-old male patient who presented with severe necrotizing pancreatitis and distant retroperitoneal abscess that reached femoral region and was detected on diagnostic imaging scans. Combination of surgical and supportive therapy was employed, and the patient recovered well with no permanent consequences. Our article highlights the importance of quick and accurate diagnosis and timely intervention in this rare type of pancreatitis complication.","25":"Disorders of sexual development (DSD) refers to a group of diseases that links the mismatch between an individual's genetic and gonadal development and its phenotype. Ovotesticular DSD (true hermaphroditism) is one such disease, in which both male and female gonads are present. A 15-year-old boy with a history of surgery for non-palpable testis was examined due to bilateral gynecomastia and known gonosomal mosaic of Klinefelter syndrome. The external genital was matured as male and, in the left half of the scrotum, there was a testicle of normal size. Despite uncertain resistance on the right side, however, the right testis was not palpable. Revision of the right groin revealed a surprising finding in the form of an ovary with a dilated fallopian tube, both of which were completely removed. Surgical revision of the left testis with biopsy was performed. The surgery was completed with a bilateral mastectomy. The postoperative course was uncomplicated, and the boy is content and fully integrated into his peer group. True hermaphroditism is a rare type of DSD. In the case described, DSD was not exhibited until puberty, after an examination for gynecomastia. The case also confirms the necessity of clarification and long-term follow-up of patients with unclear findings during surgery for non-palpable testis. Diagnostic laparoscopy is clearly indicated in these situations.","26":"Malignant otitis externa is an inflammation of the external auditory canal with preceding osteomyelitis of the temporal bone and the adjacent structures that could be potentially lethal. Malignant otitis externa may present with cranial nerve involvements and massive spread of disease mimicking nasopharyngeal carcinoma or any other malignancies on imaging. Two elderly patients who presented with severe otalgia and significant facial nerve palsy and lower cranial nerve palsies showing extensive spread of disease are reported in this case series. They both had resolution of disease after a prolonged course of antibiotics and cortical mastoidectomy for disease clearance in one of them.","27":"To evaluate and discuss the outcomes of a combination of ventriculocystostomy (VC) and endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) for obstructive hydrocephalus (HCP) due to ventricular\/cisternal arachnoid cysts, and only ETV for obstructive HCP due to different etiologies. We retrospectively reviewed all 40 symptomatic patients (aged 4 months - 61 years) of obstructive HCP treated by ETV or VC+ETV during October 2014 - April 2019. VC+ETV was performed in 7 patients with intraventricular\/cisternal arachnoid cyst and obstructive HCP. Only ETV was performed in 33 patients with obstructive HCP due to other etiologies.

The histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2-blockers) are off-labeled drugs that are frequently prescribed in preterm neonates to prevent stress ulcers. The impact of the H2-blockers on the development of the necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants is still controversial, particularly in the developing world. One hundred twenty-two preterm infants were enrolled in the study. The multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify potential postnatal risk factors associated with NEC. Preterm infants (n = 51) with total NEC, medical NEC, and surgical NEC had the highest rate of receiving ranitidine compared with controls (n = 71) (39.2%, 19.6%, and 47.6%, p &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that ranitidine use and nosocomial infections were significantly associated with NEC development (odds ratios 1.55 and 3.3). We confirm that ranitidine administration was associated with an increased risk of NEC in preterm infants. H2-blockers use should be only administered in very strictly selected cases after careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio. ","31":"Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is one of the most important causes of liver disease worldwide leading the foreground cause of liver transplantation. Recently miRNAs, small non-coding molecules were identified as an important player in the negative translational regulation of many protein-coding genes involved in hepatic metabolism. Visceral adipose tissue was found to take part in lipid and glucose metabolism and to release many inflammatory mediators that may contribute to progression of NAFLD from simple steatosis to Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis. Since visceral adipose tissue enlargement and dysregulated levels of miRNAs were observed in patients with NAFLD, the aim of this paper is to reflect the current knowledge of the role of miRNAs released from visceral adipose tissue and NAFLD.","32":"Intraoperative iliac artery dissection during kidney transplantation is a rare but serious complication that requires prompt intervention. We present a case of right external iliac artery dissection during deceased donor kidney transplantation. A 57-year-old male patient underwent standard pretransplant evaluation and had no signs of either significant aortoiliac occlusive disease or peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Diabetic nephropathy, arterial hypertension and smoking were the underlying causes of the patient's end-stage renal disease. Transplantation was performed in the standard fashion. The kidney was positioned in the right iliac fossa and the venous end to-side anastomosis was performed first. A significant dissection of the right external iliac artery was found on arteriotomy. Immediate ilio-femoral bypass with a vascular prosthesis was performed. During two years of follow-up the kidney function is stable and there are no signs of lower limb vascular insufficiency.","33":"Coronavirus infectious disease-19 caused by Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 has emerged to be an emergency global health crisis for more than a year. And, as the disease has spread, a number of new clinical features have been observed in these patients. Immunosuppression caused by this disease results in an exacerbation of pre-existing infections. While corticosteroids are considered a life-saving therapeutic intervention for this pandemic, they have proved to be a double-edged sword and their indiscriminate use has produced some deleterious results. Recently, in the backdrop of this expression, a notable rise in invasive fungal infections has been identified even in the post-remission phase. Mucormycosis, Aspergillosis, and Candidiasis are the three most common opportunistic fungal infections among those observed. COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus are already at a higher risk of developing such secondary infections due to impaired immunity. Here we present a rare case report of a 50-year old male diabetic mellitus patient diagnosed with dual fungal infections (Aspergillosis along with Mucormycosis) leading to maxillary sinusitis as a post-COVID manifestation. To our knowledge, this is the first such case reported till date.","34":"Cystic lymphangioma (CL) is a rare benign tumour that arises from the lymphatic vessels.

Immunosuppression caused by COVID-19 results in an exacerbation of pre-existing infections. Recently, in the backdrop of COVID-19 expression, a notable rise in the incidence of secondary infections, both fungal and bacterial, have been reported either during the disease or as a post-COVID manifestation. A 70-year-old male diabetic COVID-19 patient reported with a chief complaint of pain in the right side maxillary region for 3 months and the passage of content from the oral cavity into the nose. Intraoral examination revealed missing teeth i.r.t. 12 to 17, denuded mucosa with exposed necrotic bone and an oroantral opening. Sequestrectomy was done and the tissue was sent for histopathological examination which revealed necrotic bone interspersed with broad aseptate fungal hyphae branched at right angles along with actinomycotic colonies and Candidal hyphae in few areas. Based on histopathological findings, a final diagnosis of mixed infections leading to Maxillary Osteomyelitis was given. No recurrence was noticed after 3 months of follow up. The occurrence of oral infections even after the remission period of COVID-19 signifies an alarming sign both for the patient and clinicians monitoring the oral health status during the follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first such case (three oral infections as a post covid manifestation in a single diabetic patient) reported in the literature till date. ","36":null,"37":"Psoriasis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease with (extra-)cutaneous manifestations. Inflammation is associated with cellular stress and tissue damage which lead to the release of alarmins (signals of danger). Goeckerman regimen (GR) is a highly efficacious treatment consisting of the application of pharmaceutical crude tar and UVB light exposure. The reduction of inflammatory processes in the skin is accompanied by changes in the levels of inflammatory markers - alarmins (HMBG-1, S100A7, S1000A8, S100A9, S100A12, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-33). The alarmin levels in sera of 19 paediatric patients with psoriasis were determined before and after GR using commercial ELISA kits. The Psoriasis area severity index (PASI) was used to determine the disease severity. GR reduced both PASI and the levels of all measured alarmins. The levels of S100A7, S100A9, IL-22, IL-33, and HMGB-1 were significantly decreased. Positive correlations between IL-22 and PASI, between S100A9 and IL-17, S100A9 and IL-22, and a negative correlation between S100A8 and IL-33 were found. Goeckerman regimen is a very effective, safe and low-cost therapy. We confirmed, it modulates the immune system reactivity, ameliorates the severity of the disease and reduces the levels of alarmins reflecting the presence and intensity of inflammation.

A systematic search concerning original studies from 2010 to 2020 was carried out through the databases PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane, according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The terms used are 'Graves' disease' and \/or 'Incidental Papillary thyroid cancer' and 'TSI' levels. Retrospective studies upon the subject were concluded in the analysis. Only three retrospective studies were found involving 916 patients with Graves' disease and Euthyroid goiter. No significant correlation has been found between TSI and the occurrence of thyroid carcinoma in patients with Graves' disease. Very little research has been conducted upon the subject. More assays are required in order to identify a possible prognostic role of TSI levels in Papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients with Graves disease.

During the night he had a traumatic rib fracture (5-11th right ribs) but still he used BiPAP ventilation during the sleep. In the morning after he presented with a diffuse and massive emphysema in the face, thorax and abdominal regions. On physical examination, the patient presented with massive swelling and crepitus on palpation. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a diffuse subcutaneous emphysema and revealed a mediastinal emphysema and bilateral small pneumothorax. A fast resolution of the emphysema was of paramount importance as the patient was severely agitated due to his inability to open both eyes, and the need to reintroduce BiPAP ventilation as soon as possible. It was placed a fenestrated subcutaneous catheter on left hemithorax and a subcutaneous ostomy on right hemithorax for comparative purpose. It was also performed a confluent centripetal massage towards drainage orifices, with immediate and substantial improvement of emphysema, especially in left hemithorax, and progressive ocular opening. Further emphysema absorption occurred during hospitalization.","43":"Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging techniques are the recent rage in the field of oral diagnostic imaging modality. It is noninvasive, faster and lacks anatomic superimposition. Earlier maxillary occlusal radiographs were used to assess and evaluate the mid palatal suture, but being a two dimensional imaging modality it could not assess the ossification process which takes place in multiple planes mostly due to curved nature of the palate. In this study we assessed the mid palatal suture morphology and classify them according to the variants using CBCT images. A total of 200 CBCT scans (95 males and 105 females) were evaluated in the present study from the archives of an imaging center. As per Angelieri classification the midpalatal suture was classified into five categories (A-E) depending on the degree of ossification that had taken place. Statistical analysis was done by Chi Square test using SPSS version 23.0. There is statistically significant difference present in the stages of maturity of mid palatal suture in various age groups with Stage B is most common in Group 1 (50%), Stage C most common in Group 2 (60%) and Group 3 (40%) and Stage E more common in Group 4 (50%). The results of the present study showed a wide variation in the initiation time and the degree of ossification and morphology of the midpalatal suture in different age groups. Although there was an increase in the closure of the suture with aging, age is not a reliable criterion for determining the open or closed nature of the suture. This finding is important in providing an idea as to how diverse is the ossification of maxillary sutures.

This clinical trial study was conducted on 160 patients with dyspepsia or gastroduodenal ulcer. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A (standard regimen) received omeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and bismuth subcitrate for 2 weeks. Group B (sequential regimen) received omeprazole and amoxicillin in 5 days and omeprazole, tinidazole and levofloxacin in 5 days. After the end of treatment regimens, 20 mg omeprazole was administered twice daily for 3 weeks. H. pylori eradication was assessed 2 months after antibiotic treatment via fecal antigen. Frequency of H. pylori eradication in group A and B was observed in 55 (68.8%) and 63 patients (78.8%), respectively. No significant difference was seen between two groups, regarding H. pylori eradication (p = 0.15). The most common side effects in group A, B were bitterness of mouth (63.8%) and nausea (16.2%), respectively (p H. pylori infection, higher rate of H. pylori eradication was seen in group B than group A. Thus, sequential regimen was a more appropriate regimen with fewer complications.

In urology the ambiguous results have been reported. Our goal was to evaluate the effect of tranexamic acid administration in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). A pilot, prospective, double-blind, randomized study was conducted to evaluate this effect. The study included 100 patients who received RARP in the period from April 2017 to January 2018. The patients were randomly assigned to study and control groups of 50 patients each. The median follow-up was 6 months. Lower haemoglobin level drop weighted for gram of operated prostate was observed in the study group when treating the dorsal vein complex (DVC) at the beginning of the procedure (p = 0.004 after 3 hours and p &lt; 0.001 after 24 hours). There was no evidence of any serious side effect of tranexamic acid. We demonstrated the safety of tranexamic acid at RARP. In addition, we showed that administration of tranexamic acid at the beginning of RARP significantly reduces the decrease in haemoglobin after the procedure when treating the DVC at the beginning of the procedure. ","46":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The progression from AD to bronchial asthma (AB) and allergic rhinitis (AR) is called atopic march. The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in the sensitization to molecular components in patients suffering from AD in relation to subgroups of patients with AR and AB. The complete dermatological and allergological examinations were performed. Specific IgE antibodies against 112 molecular components were measured with the multiplex ImmnoCAP ISAC test. Altogether 104 atopic dermatitis patients (50 men, 54 women) at the average age 40.1 years were examined. The sensitization to molecular components was confirmed in 93.3% of patients. The sensitization to components of mites, grasses, trees, animals, moulds, and shrimps was significantly more frequent in patients with severe form of AD and the sensitization to components of grasses, trees, and moulds was significantly higher in subgroup of patients with AB. In subgroup of patients suffering from AR the higher occurrence of pollen-derived and pollen-food derived PR-10 proteins, grasses, mites, and animals was observed also. We have confirmed the significant differences in the sensitization to molecular components in patients suffering from severe form of AD, and in subgroups of patients suffering from AB and AR. These molecular components may play the important role in the consecutive development of different allergy pathologies called atopic march. ","47":"We aimed to evaluate whether C-reactive protein(CRP)\/ Albumin ratio (CAR) performed in the early postoperative period after total laryngectomy could be a predictive factor for the development of pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF). The files of patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent total laryngectomy between January 2005 and January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with PCF (PCF group) and without (Non-PCF group). CAR values and risk factors were compared between groups. The overall incidence of PCF was 23.2%. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of CRP and CAR levels (p = 0.001). The CAR value of 27.05 (sensitivity = 75.0% , specificity 68.2%, area under curve (AUC) = 0.742, 95% confidence interval 0.616-0.868) was determined as a cutoff value to describe the development of fistula in the early postoperative period. In multiple linear regression analysis, there was an independent relationship between presence of PCF and previous RT and CAR value. CAR, performed in the early postoperative period, may be a new and useful marker for predicting PCF after total laryngectomy. ","48":"Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) has worldwide prevalence. The primary objective of this systematic review was to compare penetrating keratoplasty (PK) and deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) regarding the efficacy and complications of the treatment of corneal scarring caused by herpes simplex keratitis. Out of the 469 articles identified during the combined search of the literature based on the PubMed and Cochrane libraries, 10 retrospective and 2 prospective studies published from January 2010 to December 2019 were included. The study outcomes indicated that both surgical approaches resulted in a comparable improvement of visual acuity (VA). However, DALK demonstrated fewer complications in the majority of studies. Higher graft survival rates were associated with higher acyclovir (ACV) doses (above 800 mg\/day), topical steroid and antibiotic drops. In conclusion, in terms of postoperative VA, both PK and DALK demonstrate comparable efficacy. However, DALK, which is applied in less severe HSK cases, is associated with fewer complications and better graft survival rates. High dosages of ACV, topical steroids and antibiotics contribute significantly to improved postoperative outcomes.","49":"Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common chronic oral mucosal lesion affecting up to 25% of the population. The diagnosis is based on well-defined clinical characteristics, but the precise aetiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. The treatment of RAS should be based on the identification and control of possible predisposing factors. A wide range of topical medicaments is available as antiseptics, anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. The systemic treatment is indicated in patients with continuous and aggressive manifestation, which is extremely rare in children. The present article provides a review of the current concept and knowledge of the aetiology, pathogenesis, and management of RAS in the paediatric population.","50":"Lung metastasis and metachronous double primary lung cancer are both common and often present diagnostic challenges. We present a case of metachronous isolated contralateral lung metastasis from pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma with EGFR mutation. A 75-yearold woman presented with left lung nodule on a routine follow-up chest radiograph. She had had surgery for pulmonary adenocarcinoma with EGFR Ex21 L858R mutation 6 years ago. She underwent surgical resection, and histologic findings revealed adenosquamous carcinoma with the same EGFR mutation. Re-assessment of the resected specimen of the primary tumor resected 6 years ago revealed the morphologically similarity to the left lung tumor. Based on morphological and genetic identity, final diagnosis was adenosquamous cell carcinoma and metachronous isolated contralateral lung metastasis. The diagnosis of metachronous isolated metastasis is difficult but important for appropriate management and prediction of prognosis. A careful pathological examination and evaluation of genetic abnormality are needed to make the correct diagnosis.","51":"Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary arterial hypertension and is frequently undiagnosed. It affects all ages but is more frequent between 20 and 60 years old. The clinical presentation is variable, and the diagnosis is based on screening and, in equivocal cases, confirmatory tests. A 19-year-old student presented with complaints of extreme fatigue, arterial hypertension, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, raising a high index of suspicion for PA. Screening tests were performed and its expressiveness excluded the need of confirmatory tests. CT-scan showed a unilateral adrenal adenoma and the patient was submitted to laparoscopic adenectomy without complications. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to avoid long term complications of PA.","52":"Accessory splenic arteries in the gastrosplenic ligament constitute one of the extremely sub-component of abdominal vasculature variations and it is imperative to recognize this anomaly while planning for complex surgeries in the supra-colic compartment. We report the case of accessory splenic arteries in an approximately 50-year-old male cadaver encountered during routine educational dissection. One of them arising from left gastroepiploic artery supplies the spleen in addition to splenic artery. Another variant vessel bifurcated to enter greater omentum and anterior pole of spleen, as discrete branches. The anatomical vascular variation, if recognized during the imaging work-ups for elective surgical procedures could avoid potential iatrogenic blood loss.","53":"The clinical presentation of iron deficiency can be very heterogeneous, including various oral and other mucosal problems. Here, in this case, we report the patient with burning mouth and dysphagia symptoms where iron deficiency was found to be the underlying cause after several months of investigations.

It is sporadic with an incidence less than 0.1% of patients suffering from iron deficiency anemia.","54":"Acute compartment syndrome occurs most frequently in connection with injuries, terminal or chemical damage of tissues, ischemia, the activity of toxins or in patients with tissue ischemia or muscle necrosis. Clinical findings have found pronounced pain, followed by paresthesias, pallor, and paresis. Decreased pulsation of arteries has also been a frequent finding. In severe forms decompressive fasciotomy has been indicated within the first 12-24 hours after diagnosis. In the following paper, the authors present the case report of a 68-year woman who swallowed 1500 mg of trazodone as an attempt at suicide. After 12 hours her husband found her lying on the carpet with compression of the left arm under the trunk. The patient was treated conservatively and followed clinically, examined by ultrasonography, EMG and finally MRI.","55":"A tremendous level of success has been achieved since the introduction of chloroquine and the combination of amodiaquine and artemisinin for the treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated malaria infections in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the recent discovery of drug resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum (P.f.) and the ability of the parasite to ingest CYP2C8 into its digestive vacuole is of great public health concern. This study probes the occurrence of CYP2C8*2 allelic mutant amongst malaria patients in North-Central Nigeria. Three hundred and eighty five (385) unrelated study participants were screened for current malaria episodes using routine microscopy and\/or rapid diagnostic test strips (RDTs). Chelex extraction method was used for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and identification of CYP2C8*2 (805A &gt; T) variant respectively. Wild-type (A) and the defective allele (T) were differentiated with the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results obtained were further validated with Sanger sequencing of a few samples and thereafter, the genotype data were statistically processed. All alleles obtained were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Out of the 385 participants (45.5% Male and 54.5% Female) genotyped for SNPs, 75 (19.5%) had the autosomal recessive mutant trait. Occurrence of mutant traits was gender and ethnic independent (p &gt; 0.05). Yoruba ethnic group recorded a reduction in proportion of genotypic defective CYP2C8*2 allele (T) (1 in every 8 persons) with a carrier percentage of 13.3% compared with Hausa (26.62%); Igbo (25.37%) and other minority ethnic groups (17.6%). A remarkable inter-ethnic differences in autosomal recessive CYP2C8*2 allele was observed. By implication, there is a gradual incursion of genetic drift for poor CQ and AQ-Artemisinin metabolizers among the inhabitants. ","56":"The aim of the study was to describe clinical characteristics and bladder assessment in children with Non-Monosymptomatic Nocturnal Enuresis (NMNE) in coastal region of Croatia. Records on 85 patients with NMNE were retrospectively reviewed. Bladder assessments were performed in all children. In this research we: (i) compare clinical characteristics and features of bladder assessment: uroflowmetry, post void residuals (PVR) and bladder wall thickness between boys and girls with NMNE and we compare (ii) clinical characteristics and bladder assessment between children with primary and secondary NMNE. There were 46 girls and 39 boys. The total of 59 children had primary NMNE and 26 children had secondary NMNE. Uroflow pattern was abnormal in 42% of all children with NMNE. Abnormal uroflow pattern in children with NMNE was more often in girls than in boys (P &lt; 0.05) and in children with secondary than in children with primary NMNE (P &lt; 0.05). Ultrasound evidence of bladder wall thickness was more frequent in boys than in girls. Girls were more likely to have dysfunctional voiding and larger residual urinary volume than boys. Abnormal uroflow pattern in children with NMNE was more often in girls than boys and in children with secondary than in children with primary NMNE.

But the results of those studies were inconsistent. Here, we performed a study to obtain a more conclusive result on the association of XPC polymorphisms with risk of CMM. The XPC Lys939Gln and Ala499Val polymorphisms were genotyped in 150 CMM cases and 150 controls by PCR-RFLP assay. Subsequently, all published relevant studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI databases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the strength of correlation. There was no significant association between XPC Lys939Gln and Ala499Val polymorphisms and CMM risk in our population. A total of 15 case-control studies including ten studies with 5,990 cases and 7,697 controls on XPC Lys939Gln and five studies with 3,139 cases and 3,721 controls on XPC Ala499Val polymorphism were selected. Pooled data revealed that XPC Lys939Gln (C vs. A: OR = 1.108, 95% CI 1.008- 1.217; P = 0.033) and Ala499Val (C vs. A: OR = 0.918, 95% CI 0.850-0.992; p = 0.031; CC+CA vs. AA: OR = 0.904, 95% CI 0.819-0.997; p = 0.043) polymorphisms were significantly associated with an increased risk of CMM. Moreover, stratified analyses by ethnicity revealed that the XPC Ala499Val and Lys939Gln polymorphisms were significantly associated with risk of CMM in Caucasians and mixed populations, respectively. This meta-analysis result suggested that XPC Lys939Gln and Ala499Val polymorphisms were significantly associated with risk of CMM. ","58":"Oral manifestations of deficiency of iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid are thought to be common. Prevalence of these deficiencies among patients with compatible symptoms is not well known. The goal of this study was to summarize evidence from a dental practice of iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency in patients presenting with compatible oral manifestations. 250 patients who presented with burning mouth syndrome, angular cheilitis, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, papillar atrophy of the tongue dorsum or mucosal erythema were identified. Patients underwent clinical examination, and the blood samples were taken. 250 patients (208 females; 42 males, mean age 44.1 years) with at least one corresponding symptom or sign were identified. The nutritional deficiency of one or more nutrients was found in 119 patients (47.6%). Seven times more females than males were noted to have one type of deficiency (104 females, 15 males). Iron deficiency as defined was diagnosed in 62 patients (24.8%), vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency in 44 patients (17.6%) and both deficiencies (iron + vitamin B12\/folic acid) in 13 patients (5.2%). The only predictive factor was gender and only for iron deficiency. The presence of more than one deficiency was noted in 10 patients (4.9%). The most commonly observed deficiency in dental practice over the course of 11 years was an iron deficiency in the female population. Age, diet and reported co-morbidities did not show statistically significant predictable value in recognizing these deficiencies. ","59":"Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (THPP) is a disease characterized by recurrent episodes of muscle weakness due to intracellular potassium shifting in the presence of high levels of thyroid hormone. It occurs more commonly amongst young Asian men with underlying Graves' disease. Attacks are commonly precipitated by ingestion of carbohydrate-rich meals or alcohols, stress or strenuous exercise. Herein, we describe an adult Thai man suffering from a hypokalemic periodic paralysis attack after receiving a dexamethasone injection. The diagnosis of Graves' disease was confirmed by his thyroid function test and a presence of thyrotropin-receptor antibody. His weakness and hypokalemia responded well to potassium supplement and a non-selective beta blocker, while his thyrotoxicosis was initially controlled by an anti-thyroid medication and subsequently with a subtotal thyroidectomy. Clinicians should beware of this manifestation when administering steroids in the thyrotoxic patients, especially of Asian male descent.","60":"Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is characterized by the triad of retrognathia, glossoptosis, and airway obstruction. PRS may occur in isolation or in conjunction with other syndromes. Distinguishing isolated and syndromic forms of PRS helps clinicians decide the management plan. We describe two cases of PRS of Indian ethnicity and describe some of the difficulties that we faced while distinguishing isolated PRS from syndromic PRS. Both cases had a similar clinical presentation. However, one of the cases had a positive family history of congenital deafness and cleft palate, whereas the other case had apparent upper limb anomalies. These facts heightened the suspicion of an associated syndrome. However, based on the available facts and after thorough investigations, a tentative diagnosis of isolated PRS was made for both the patients. Both the cases were managed conservatively and were advised a long-term follow-up. When the associated anomalies are few, minor or concealed at birth, longitudinal follow-up of all PRS cases combined with thorough diagnostics including chromosomal analysis could help differentiate syndromic PRS from isolated PRS. Regardless, all cases of PRS require a multidisciplinary approach.","61":"Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) also commonly known as malignant otitis externa was first described by Meltzer and Kelemen in 1959. Prior to the advent of the antibiotic era, this disease carried a poor prognosis with significant morbidity. It often proved fatal with mortality rates as high as 50%. Commonly seen in the immunocompromised patients, diabetes mellitus is an important associated comorbidity in the pathophysiologic development of this disease. Treatment is instituted by medical therapy with surgery having a limited role. Surgical intervention has a limited role, for example, in fungal SBO. Such cases may require local debridement and intraoperative tissue biopsies for histopathologic confirmation. This is to demonstrate fungal invasion into the skull base, as well as to exclude other sinister differential diagnoses like squamous cell carcinoma of temporal bone. In this case report, we present a rare case of candida SBO and the literature review.","62":"A two-year-old girl with two weeks of abdominal pain, vomiting, and food refusal, ten months after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion because of inadequate peroral intake, was admitted to a tertiary centre hospital. On admission, the extracorporeal part of the gastrostomy was much shortened. X-ray examination revealed migration of the end of the gastrostomy tube with a left-shifted course of the tube through the duodenum. Gastroscopy and subsequently laparotomy were performed. A longitudinal pressure necrosis was identified under the tube, with two perforations in the duodenojejunal region. Ten centimeters of that duodenojejunal region were resected, and end-to-end anastomosis was made. The migration of the gastrostomy was probably caused by insufficient care by the parents. Pathophysiologically, the tube caused the pressure necrosis in the duodenojejunal area; this was supported by histology. This is a hitherto undescribed complication of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, showing that migration of the gastrostomy to the deeper part of the small bowel can lead to pressure necrosis, a potentially life-threatening condition in children which cannot be treated without invasive procedures.","63":"To compare the effect of epidural steroid injections (ESI) in patients with discogenic sciatica (Sci) versus patients with lumbar canal stenosis (LSS), not controlled by conservative treatment. In our study, 80 patients with Sci and 66 with LSS were included. A single ESI (10 mg dexamethasone in 3 cc 0.25% bupivacaine) was applied under fluoroscopic control: one level above the highest stenotic level, in the posterior epidural space, via interlaminar approach in LSS and at the prolapse level, in the anterior epidural space, via transforaminal route in Sci. Pain intensity was assessed by VAS at baseline and on days 1, 15 and 30 after intervention. The procedure was successful in 78 Sci and 63 LSS patients. Patients with Sci responded significantly better. At one month, pain reduction over 50% was achieved in 63% (52.3-73.7% at p = 0.95) of Sci but only in 35% (23.2-46.8%) of LSS (p = 0.03). Return to pre-intervention level happened in 47% (34.7-59.3%) of LSS versus 14% (6.3-21.7%) of Sci patients (p = 0.01). In 5 patients the procedure failed, without resulting morbidity. ESI are more effective in patients with Sci than in single level LSS. In multiple level LSS, results are disappointing.

Based upon the etiology and the pathophysiology, it is divided into, the primary and secondary. The primary hydrocele includes the neonatal or the congenital, the communicating and the non-communicating or the closed or the adult type. The secondary hydrocele can develop in the substrate of a pre-existing disease. After systematic and thorough systematic and thorough research of the relevant literature, we aim at describing all the aspects of this entity, with specific emphasis on the issues that remain unanswered from the scientific community.","67":"Penile torsion is a rare congenital anomaly that is usually characterized by a counterclockwise rotation of the penile shaft or glans. Although several surgical techniques for its correction have been proposed, the consensus of choosing the most efficient technique remains controversial. Herein, we report our operational approach that successfully corrected a severe (&gt;90 degrees) isolated penile torsion in the form of penile degloving and dorsal dartos flap rotation surgery.","68":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been directly related to acuminate warts and cervical cancer, the second most common neoplasia among women. Given the lack of treatment against the virus itself, many medications have been utilised, mainly aiming in modifying the host's immunological response. We present the case of a 54 years old postmenopausal patient with a history of vaginal cuff wart and HPV persistence that we managed in our clinic for 6 months with a mix of curcumin, aloe vera, amla and other natural ingredients. As the patient was found to be intolerant to imiquimod (one of the most common conservative methods of treatment) we attempted the use of curcumin, which was applied to the area of the wart three times per week for 6 months. Both clinical and colposcopical improvement was noted in regular clinic visits with regression of the lesion. The outcome of this case encourages our view that curcumin should be considered as a significant treatment modality against HPV infection and acuminate warts.","69":"The paper presents the results of treating 14 patients, namely eight patients with visceral artery aneurysms and six patients with visceral artery pseudoaneurysms. In 64.3% of the patients, the initial diagnosis was made based on the ultrasound examination. All the patients (100%) underwent CT angiography, while angiography was performed in 71.4% of the cases. Five (35.7%) patients with visceral artery pseudoaneurysms were emergently hospitalized; among them, the signs of bleeding were observed in 2 patients. In 9 patients, pathology was detected during tests for other conditions. Five (35.7%) patients underwent endovascular treatment, while 9 (64.3%) patients received surgical treatment. Endovascular interventions and open surgery demonstrated a nil mortality rate. After endovascular treatment, stent thrombosis was found in 1 patient. In the case of surgical treatment, visceral artery aneurysm was observed in 1 patient who underwent the resection of superior mesenteric artery pseudoaneurysm. Conclusions. The choice of the method of treating visceral artery aneurysms and visceral artery pseudoaneurysms depends on the location, size, anatomic features of the visceral arteries and the clinical course of the disease. Both endovascular and surgical treatment demonstrate good postoperative outcomes. Visceral ischemia is one of the most serious complications in the postoperative period, which can complicate both the diagnosis and the choice of treatment tactics.","70":"the PAI-1 rs1799889 polymorphism has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to ischemic stroke. However, the results of previous studies have been inconsistent or controversial. Hence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of PAI-1 rs1799889 polymorphism with ischemic stroke risk. A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO, CNKI, and CBD databases up to November 05, 2019. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to access the strength of this association in fixed- or random-effects model. A total of 44 case-control studies with 8,620 cases and 10,260 controls were selected. Pooled data showed a significant association between PAI-1 rs1799889 polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk in the overall populations (GG vs. AA: OR = 0.791, 95% CI 0.633-0.988, p = 0.039; GA vs. AA: OR = 0.807, 95% CI 0.683-0.953, p = 0.012; and GG+GA vs. AA: OR = 0.795, 95% CI 0.637-0.993, p = 0.043). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity revealed a significant association in Asian and Mixed populations, but not in Caucasians. Moreover, stratified analysis by country of origin revealed an increased risk of ischemic stroke in Chinese populations, but not among Dutch (Netherlands) and Swedish. This meta-analysis result suggested that PAI-1 rs1799889 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially in Asian and Mixed populations. ","71":"The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the 532 nm (green) diode subthreshold micropulse laser (SML) in the treatment of non-centre involved clinically significant macular edema (CSME) in comparison to the conventional laser photocoagulation (CLP). A total of 60 eyes of patients diagnosed with non-centre involved CSME were randomly divided into two groups. SML photocoagulation was performed in the first group (G1), while CLP in the second one (G2). Central macular thickness (CMT) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured prior to treatment and at 3 and 6 months after intervention. G1 participants had significantly better CMT at 6 months after laser application (p = 0.04) compared to G2. Additionally, CMT in both groups was significantly lower 6 months after laser application in comparison to baseline values (G1: p &lt; 0.001, G2: p = 0.002). Moreover, significant improvement was detected 6 months after SML in G1 regarding BCVA compared to values before laser treatment (p = 0.001). SML was more effective than CLP in reducing CMT and improving BCVA in patients with non-centre involved CSME. Therefore, it seems that SML can be a good substitute for CLP in DME treatment if confirmed in future studies.

We examine if the annual numbers of hours of sunshine could affect the number of patients with melanoma. In the peridod of 2002-2017, altogether 2230 patients with new diagnosis of melanoma were examined. We studied 1) If there is some trend in the occurrence of lentigo maligna and melanoma in situ, melanoma superficiale, and melanoma nodulare and if there is a difference in the age of patients with this diagnosis (adjusted calculation of specific kind of melanomas and adjusted calculation of age). 2) If the annual numbers of hours of sunshine affect the trend in the occurrence of melanoma and if the annual numbers of hours of sunshine affect the body site of melanoma. Our study confirmed that the number of patients with lentigo maligna and melanoma in situ had increased in East Bohemia region in the period of 2002-2017. The number of melanomas of nodular and superficial type does not increase. The total number of melanomas in this period does not increase either. No difference of the age of patients with melanoma nodulare, superficiale, lentigo maligna and melanoma in situ was confirmed. We confirmed no relation of the annual numbers of hours of sunshine to the number of melanoma and to the body site of melanoma.

No change in the occurrence of melanoma and in age of melanoma during this period was found. The difference between men and women was not confirmed in histology, but the difference between men and women was confirmed in the body site of lesion and in the length of duration of lesion. No relation between the length of duration of lesions from which melanoma had originated and its histology was confirmed. The relation was confirmed between histology and body site of melanoma. The relation between the body site and the length of duration of previous lesions was confirmed also.

An original high resolution HPLC technique has been proposed to reveal and characterize this peculiarity. To solve this task, a novel molecular size exclusion - anion exchange analytical technique was developed. Its applicability to diagnostics and oncogenesis research is quizzed here.","76":"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can present a diagnostic dilemma owing to the varying degrees of disease severity and the wide range of precipitating factors. Here, we report a case of a 56-year-old man who presented with signs and symptoms of heart failure and, during the course of treatment, developed intravascular hemolysis. On investigation, he was found to be G6PD deficient. Following discontinuation of the fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine, the clinical condition of the patient improved, and there were no further episodes of hemolysis. The case highlights the need for a high degree of suspicion of G6PD deficiency in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of intravascular hemolysis.","77":"Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a subgroup of lysosomal storage disorders. The underlying mechanism of MPS disorders are deficiency in specific enzymes which leads to accumulation of partially degraded glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in various tissues. A wide variety of manifestations are reported but musculoskeletal complaints are common among them. In milder forms of MPS, musculoskeletal complaints are presenting symptoms. Delays in diagnosis due to unspecific and mild symptoms is common. Misdiagnosis of MPS as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other inflammatory arthritis disorders is frequent. Early diagnosis and treatment prevents irreversible cellular damages and is a key factor in efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy. In this study we described two MPS patients with musculoskeletal complaints who were not diagnosed for a period of time. Although musculoskeletal manifestation are common in a variety of clinical conditions, their presence at low ages or co-occurrence of other manifestations (such as cardiac, respiratory, neurologic, etc.) in multiple systems should prompt evaluation of patients for MPS and other metabolic disorders. The rheumatologists' awareness on MPS should be promoted to achieve timely diagnosis and subsequent early treatment.","78":"A nonagenarian hypertensive man with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was admitted to the emergency department for gastrointestinal symptoms and worsening symptoms of depression. Severe hypercalcemia (15.3 mg\/dL) was found and he was hospitalized. Fluids, loop diuretics and glucocorticoids were administered intravenously, which partially reduced calcium levels over a few days and improved his clinical condition. PTH levels proved increased (306 pg\/mL) and 25-OHD levels were reduced; primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was diagnosed. Neck ultrasonography (USG) did not show parathyroid enlargement, nor did 99mTechnetium-sestamibi (SESTAMIBI) scintigraphy reveal hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. By contrast, 18F-choline PET\/CT evidenced a nodule located close to the oesophagus, behind the right thyroid lobe, which proved compatible with a hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland. Since the patient declined surgery, and zoledronate was unfit owing to areas of rarefaction of the jaw, the calcimimetic cinacalcet was started; the dosage was progressively titrated up to 120 mg\/day with normalisation of calcium levels over time. PTH levels, however, proved erratic and showed an upward trend over the first year of therapy; however its levels partially decreased following increase of vitamin D levels by replacement therapy. Cinacalcet is a useful and safe drug, which can normalise calcium levels and improve the clinical condition, even in very old patients with severe PHPT who decline or are unfit for surgery.","79":"To reduce the risk of insulin resistance in obesity in children with lactase gene genotypes, we studied the factors that stimulate the chronic inflammatory process. 109 children 6-18 years of age were investigated. The main group (n = 56) was presented by children with signs of insulin-resistant obesity according to the criteria of the European Society of Endocrinology and the Pediatric Endocrine Society. The control group (n = 53) included obese children without insulin resistance. A comprehensive clinical examination, food diary analysis, genotyping of the lactase gene by means of the polymerase chain reaction, the Immunochemical Test Method with Electrochemiluminescent Detection of basal insulinemia, Hydrogen breath test with lactose load, sequential analysis, ROC analysis were carried out. Clinical manifestations of lactose maldigestion in a child increased the risk of possible insulin resistance (prognostic coefficient (PC +2.6), as well as the presence of the lactase C\/C 13910 gene genotype (PC +5.8) did. The genotype C\/T 13910 in children had a protective effect on the risk of obesity (PC -2.9). The lowest risk of insulin-resistant obesity in observed among children with the genotype T\/T 13910 (PC -12). The presence of the C\/C 13910 genotype of the lactase gene is the main factor formation of insulin resistance in children's obesity. What is known?

However, the results had been conflicting and controversial. In order to give a comprehensive and precise result, we summarized available data to analyze the association of this polymorphism with CRC and GC risk. A comprehensive literature search on PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, and CNKI database was performed to identify all eligible studies up to May 15, 2019. The strength of association was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 29 case-control studies including 16 studies with 7,560 cases and 9,574 controls on CRC and 13 studies with 1,445 cases and 2,918 controls on GC were selected. Overall, pooled data showed that the IL-6 -174G&gt;C polymorphism was not significantly associated with increased risk of CRC and GC in overall. When stratified by ethnicity, we found a statistically significant association between the IL-6 -174 G&gt;C polymorphism and CRC risk in Asians (CC vs. GG: OR = 1.860, 95% CI 1.061-3.258, p = 0.030; and CC vs. CG+GG: OR = 1.941, 95% CI 1.131-3.331, p = 0.016). The meta-analysis suggests that IL-6 -174G&gt;C polymorphism was not significantly associated with the increased risk of CRC and GC in overall population. However, the results showed that IL-6 -174G&gt;C polymorphism may be associated with risk of GC in Asians. Further studies including a larger sample size will be necessary to clarify these results. ","82":"Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is associated with a poor survival rate. The vast majority of pancreatic cancers are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. In the absence of metastatic disease, operability depends on the extent of local disease; in particular, the presence or absence of vascular and lymph node involvement. Adequate staging is vital in deciding an appropriate treatment plan. Cross sectional imaging including CT, MRI and PET-CT are commonly used for staging. However, EUS is a useful adjunct for accurate loco-regional staging in addition to allowing diagnostic tissue samples to be obtained. Emerging EUS-guided therapeutic techniques have opened up new horizons in the management of pancreatic malignancy. EUS guidance can be used for coeliac plexus neurolysis in patients with intractable pain and fiducial placement in directing stereotactic radiotherapy. The majority of patients with cancer of the pancreatic head present with biliary obstruction. ERCP can be used to drain the obstructed biliary system with plastic or metal stents and offers an opportunity to confirm the diagnosis by obtaining brush cytology and forceps biopsy specimens. EUS-guided choledocho-duodenostomy or hepatico-gastrostomy is increasingly being employed for draining the biliary system if ERCP is unsuccessful.","83":"Antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein cause inflammatory lesions of central myelin - in optic nerves, of the brainstem, and spinal cord.

The purpose of this case report is to highlight some certain features, along with an extensive research of the relevant literature. A 6-year-old boy was admitted to the Otorhinolaryngology Department due to the presence of a left-sided, painless, latero-cervical swelling, first observed by his parents 2 weeks ago. Physical examination revealed a painless, well-delineated mass, with no signs of inflammation. No enlarged cervical nodes were present. The mass extended from the mandibular angle, under the sternocleidomastoid muscle, in proximity with the ipsilateral neurovascular bundle. Ultrasound transverse gray-scale panoramic view detected a wellcircumscribed lesion, with fine echogenic foci, appearing in close proximity with the upper pole of the left thyroid lobe and the ipsilateral common carotid artery. Elective surgical intervention with complete mass excision was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a cervical thymic cyst. Cervical thymic remnants represent a group of neck masses that pediatricians and pediatric surgeons should consider in differential diagnosis of both cystic and solid neck masses. Most cystic cervical thymic masses are found in the lower third of the anterior neck, extending deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, featuring close anatomic relationship with the composites of the ipsilateral carotid sheath. Elective surgery is kept as the treatment of choice, after ruling out the possibility of subject immunologic disturbance.","85":null,"86":"The most common occupational disease is carpal tunnel syndrome.

Preseptal inflammation was the most common type (73% vs. 74%), followed by subperiosteal abscess (21% vs. 20%). Surgery was indicated in 35% vs. 37% of the patients (p = 0.434). The most commonly used surgical approach was the external route (80%) in Group A and endoscopic endonasal surgery (60%) or a combination of endoscopic surgery of the paranasal sinuses and external orbitotomy (30%) in Group B (p &lt; 0.001). The percentage of reoperations was 13% vs. 14%. In cases of revision surgery, the orbit was always treated using the external surgical approach. Complete recovery was achieved in 92% and 98.5% of the patients belonging to Group A and B, respectively (p = 0.622). Nowadays, the endoscopic endonasal approach is the most frequently used surgical technique for paranasal sinuses. The technique used to treat the orbital complication itself depends on several factors. Nowadays, the endoscopic approach is preferred. The external approach can be considered in the case of recurrent or persistent abscesses, especially if they are located in the upper or the lateral part of the orbit.

Particular importance is ascribed to the underlying psychopathology and motivation of foreign body ingestion in each category of patients. The surgical, psychiatric and legal implications of the issue are discussed in detail.","90":"There is a growing corpus of evidence indicating that anti-VEGF therapy may normalize the abnormal tumor vasculature with the potential to re-program the tumor immune microenvironment to a more immunosupportive profile. Tumor vessel normalization increases tumor perfusion, and, consequently, oxygen and nutrient supply, and thus can be assumed to improve the general response to anticancer immunotherapy. The increased antitumor immunity responses seen following anti-VEGF therapy may also be associated with the inhibition of the immunosuppressive action deployed by VEGF on effector T cells. Bearing in mind the recent advances of combination immunotherapy, combinations of anti-VEGF therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors now appear to represent an attractive strategy. Key to the successful implementation of a combination strategy for treating cancer is understanding the interaction of these two therapeutic interventions, particularly in regards to appropriate reprogramming of the tumor immune microenvironment to improve antitumor immunity.","91":"Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is the most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in infants, and classically presents at 2 to 6 weeks of age. Delayed presentation is an extremely rare occurrence after early infancy. A 14-weeks-old full term male infant presented with non-bilious vomiting, dehydration and hypocloremic metabolic alkalosis. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed tubular mass 20 mm in lenght. Because of unusual age, diagnosis was confirmed with upper gastrointestinal contrast study. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy was performed. After surgery the child was free of symptoms, had gained weight, and was tolerating a regular diet.

","92":"Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is an uncommon intraepithelial malignancy, affecting the vulvo-perineal and perianal region, occurring in 6.5% of all Paget diseases. Usually, an underlying invasive adenocarcinoma denotes a more aggressive behaviour of the disease. We present the multidisciplinary approach in a 75-year old patient with this rare disease. The patient underwent a radical surgical excision and, subsequently, a Singapore flap was used for primary closure. The final histology confirmed the presence of a non-invasive Paget tumor, but a focus of high-grade invasive adenocarcinoma was noted in a perineal nodule. The histological margins were free of tumor. The patient did not undergo any adjuvant treatment because of severe chronic medical problems, although, eighteen months after treatment, she remains well, with no signs of recurrence. In conclusion, radical surgical excision, often necessitating reconstruction techniques, remains the gold standard of care and further adjuvant treatment should be individualised.","93":"The high incidence of hepato-biliary vascular anatomy variations necessitates its evaluation prior to performing liver transplantation, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, gastric and oesophageal surgeries. We report a unique case of persistence of embryonic arteries of the liver, wherein, the liver was supplied by five vessels. In addition to the usual right and left hepatic arteries from the hepatic artery proper, the liver received two accessory right hepatic arteries, one from the gastroduodenal artery, while another arising from superior mesenteric artery and an accessory left hepatic artery, from the left gastric artery. The origin of gastroduodenal artery was found to be unusually high and its abnormal anterior course over the common bile duct further added complexity to the hepatobiliary anatomy. The presence of these aberrant and accessory arteries predisposes to inadvertent injury leading to patient morbidity and sometimes mortality.","94":"The non-recurrent laryngeal nerve (nRLN) is a rare anatomic variation that every head and neck surgeon must be aware of, in order to avoid intraoperative injury which leads to postoperative morbidity. We are reporting a case of a nRLN in a 47 year old female patient with medullary thyroid carcinoma who was surgically treated with total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection. Both two inferior laryngeal nerves were identified, fully exposed and preserved along their cervical courses. However, we found that the right inferior laryngeal nerve was non-recurrent and directly arised from the cervical vagal trunk, entered the larynx after a short transverse course and parallel to the inferior thyroid artery. The safety of thyroid operations is dependent on high index of suspicion, meticulous identification and dissection of laryngeal nerves either recurrent or non-recurrent. This leads to minimum risk of iatrogenic damage of the nerves. Complete knowledge of the anatomy of these neural structures, including all their anatomic variations is of paramount importance.","95":"The aim of this article is to review the interface between psychiatry and ophthalmology at several levels, such as the influence of psychopharmacology on eye disorders, the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in eye diseases, and the neuroophthalmological examination methods supporting the validity of psychiatric diagnoses. We searched the PubMed computer database for the key words \"Psychiatry\" and \"Ophthalmology\" on the 28th of August, 2018 to obtain relevant articles which were consequently summarized. The results showed that most patients with ocular disease simultaneously have one or more psychiatric symptoms. We also found a prevalence of eye-related side effects in patients who use psychiatric drugs. At the same time, we observed that some ophthalmology methods of diagnostics can be used as diagnostic tools in psychiatry. Most studies showed a significant relation between psychiatry and ophthalmology, such as eye symptoms and diseases following long-term use of psychotropics as well as psychiatric symptoms and syndromes in patients with eye disorders. Our review may be beneficial to psychiatrists, ophthalmologists, and, last but not least, the patients themselves. ","96":"Ionised hypocalcemia (S-Ca2+) has been repeatedly observed in neonates with sepsis. Our aim was to evaluate total calcemia (S-Ca) and its relationship to laboratory markers of infection. We retrospectively evaluated total calcemia (S-Ca) and its relationship to laboratory markers of sepsis\/infection (serum levels of C-reactive protein - S-CRP and procalcitonin - S-PCT) in 29 full-term neonates with early-onset neonatal infection hospitalized at our neonatology ward between 2012 and 2016. The control group consisted of 705 neonates without infection. In neonates with early-onset infection , the S-Ca on day 1, 2 and 3 was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0001; p &lt; 0.0001; p = 0.05 versus controls) same as the pooled S-Ca (p &lt; 0.0001 versus controls). There was a weak negative correlation between pooled S-Ca and S-PCT, or pooled S-Ca and S-CRP (r = -0.22, p = 0.06; r = -0.19, p = 0.09). S-Ca was decreased in neonates with early-onset infection and did show a slight tendency to inverse correlation with S-CRP and S-PCT. Pediatricians must be aware of the fact that a drop in total S-Ca should alert their attention to the risk of neonatal infection, and, likewise, that the children with neonatal infection are at a higher risk of hypocalcemia with all its consequences. ","97":"The aim of this research is to study the effect of body overweight at birth (fetal macrosomia) on the processes of tooth eruption and tooth growth during the first year of life in children in the Kharkiv City (Ukraine) population. One of the research tasks is to examine the features of deciduous teeth eruption in children who were born with macrosomia with different values of the weight-height index at birth. Materials and methods. The medical records of the children born between 1977 and 2013 have been analyzed. The database has been collected in one of the Kharkiv City clinic. The Main Group is comprised of the medical records of the children (separately for boys and girls) born with fetal macrosomia. All the medical records of the Main Group have been divided into subgroups taking into account the gender and the harmonious (well-balanced) development coefficient. The Comparison Group is comprised of the medical records of the children also born within the normal term range, but with weight and height that correspond to the gestation age (fetal normosomia). To determine the average time of the first tooth eruption, as well as the deciduous teeth growth rate for each of the groups under the study, we have used the hypothesis about a linear dependence between the number of erupted teeth and the age of the child. The statistical data processing and verification of the consistency of this hypothesis is performed using the multiple linear regression analysis with the STATISTICA 6.0 software package (Multiple Regression module). The number of delayed eruption and premature eruption cases observed is calculated along with the corresponding confidence intervals for the significance level, p, of less than 0.05, taking into account the binomial distribution of the random variable. The results of the study indicate a slowed growth rate of deciduous teeth in children born with macrosomia, as well as an increased number of cases (by a factor of 2 to 4 times) of deviations in the timing of teeth eruption compared to regional norms. The smallest growth rate of deciduous teeth and the smallest number of teeth at the age of one year are registered in macrosomic boys and macrosomic girls with a long body and a relatively reduced birth weight, as well as in macrosomic girls with intrauterine obesity. The macrosomic girls with intrauterine acceleration with obesity at the background have the largest average tooth growth rate and the largest percentage of premature eruption cases among all subgroups. Conclusions. The somatometric features of fetal macrosomia suggest the influence on the number of teeth that erupt by a certain age. The data on the deviation from the generally accepted terms of teeth eruption in children born with macrosomia, can be the basis for developing new and improving existing prevention programs aimed at preserving dental health.","98":"The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of drug non-adherence in stable chronic heart failure (CHF) patients using serum drug levels (SDL) assessment. CHF patients were prospectively enrolled during scheduled outpatient visit. Except standard procedures an unanticipated blood sampling for the SDL assessment was obtained. Analysis was focused on the prescribed heart failure and antihypertensive medication and was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The patient was labelled as non-adherent if at least one of drugs assessed was not found in the serum. In the first half of patients multiple SDL have been evaluated during the follow-up. Eighty one patients were enrolled. The non-adherence was proven in twenty of them (25%). In the subgroup of thirty eight patients with multiple SDL evaluation the non-adherence raised significantly with increasing number of visits assessed together (21% for single visit, 29% for two of three visits assessed together and 34% for all three visits evaluated together, all p &lt; 0.001). The non-adherence was proven in significant part of stable CHF patients using SDL assessment. This method seems to be reliable and effective and should be a part of clinical assessment in selected patients with CHF. ","99":"Spinal epidermoid cysts are benign tumors. Syringomyelia secondary to intramedullary tumors are frequently observed. However, the association between syringomyelia and spinal intradural extramedullary epidermoid cyst in the conus medullaris region is extremely rare. We present the case of a 3-year-old male who was admitted with paraparesis and urinary retention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine demonstrated intradural extramedullary lesion, compatible with epidermoid cyst, that at the conus medullaris level and a large syringomyelia extending from T4 to L1 vertebrae. Total microsurgical excision of the cyst was performed. No additional drainage was carried out for the syringomyelic cavity. Histopathological examination verified the diagnosis of the epidermoid cyst. Total excision of the cyst and disappearance of the syringomyelia were observed on MRI at 15 days postoperatively. We have clarified the etiology, clinical, histopathological and radiological features, differential diagnosis, and treatment modalities of spinal epidermoid cysts. In addition, we have discussed the possible mechanisms of syringomyelia formation in spinal intradural lesions.","100":null,"101":"Plants with anticancer properties are considered as cancer preventive and treatment sources, due to their some biological effects. Apoptosis induction and anti-proliferative effects of Baneh extract on various cancer cell lines have been reported. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of this fruit on KB and human gingival fibroblast cell lines (HGF). KB and HGF cells were treated with various concentrations of ethanolic Baneh extract and cisplatin as positive control. Cytotoxic activity and apoptosis induction were investigated using WST-1 and Annexin V assays. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and student's t-tests. IC50 after 24 and 48 hours treatment were respectively 2.6 and 1 mg\/mL for KB cell line, and 1.5 and 1.6 mg\/mL for HGF cell. During 48 hours Baneh extract induced apoptosis without significant necrosis, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The induction of apoptosis in KB cells was significantly higher than HGF. It seems that ethanolic extract of Baneh contains compounds that can suppress KB cell growth through the induction of apoptosis. Within 48 hours, less cytotoxic effects were observed on normal fibroblast cells; therefore, it might be a potential anticancer agent.","102":null,"103":"A nightstick fracture is an isolated fracture of the ulnar shaft. Although operative and non-operative treatments have been commonly decided by the degree of displacement of the fracture, still there is a controversy specially in those moderately displaced. Herein we report our experience with nightstick fractures. To evaluate operative and non-operative treatment of nightstick fracture. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical notes, physiotherapy letters and radiographs of 52 patients with isolated ulnar shaft fractures. Outcome Measurements included radiographic healing, post-operative range of motion and complications. The study included 13 females and 39 males, with a mean age of 26 years [range, 18-93 years]. The mean Follow-up period was 32 months ranged from 12 to 54 months. Ten patients were treated non-operatively; forty-two patients had open reduction and internal fixation including six open fractures. The average wait for surgery was 2.5 days. Mobilisation was commenced immediately after the surgeries non-load bearing. 40 patients had no complications post-operatively with good outcome and average of four visits follow-up. In the non-operative group, five out ten failed and had a mean follow-up of nine visits. Satisfactory outcome is to be expected with open reduction and internal fixation. Fractures with less than 50% displacement should be treated on individual bases, considering; age, pre-morbid functional status, co-morbidities, compliance and associated injuries.

The aim of our study was assessment of parathyroid scintigraphy diagnostic accuracy regarding to size and metabolic parameters of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue. Parathyroid scintigraphy for suspected primary hyperparathyroidism was performed in 95 patients during years 2015 and 2016. Of them, 75 patients with known clinical outcome (40 underwent surgery, 35 had documented laboratory follow-up) were further retrospectively evaluated. The performance of dual tracer 99mTc-pertechnetate and 99mTc-MIBI subtraction and dual-time-point 99mTc-MIBI imaging with SPECT\/CT was analysed. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcaemia, ionized calcaemia and phosphataemia and ultrasound detected adenoma volume and largest diameter in false negative and true positive findings were compared using Mann-Whitney test. Sensitivity and specificity of parathyroid scintigraphy was 74.5% and 95.8%, respectively. NPV was 63.8% and PPV 97.4%. Hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue detectability was almost significantly associated with hypophosphataemia and PTH levels. Parathyroid scintigraphy provides high sensitivity and superior specificity in parathyroid adenoma location, nevertheless the diagnostic accuracy tends to decline in smaller adenomas and in less metabolically active parathyroid tissue causing only subtle biochemical changes. 18F-Fluorocholine PET\/CT or 3D SPECT\/CT subtraction should be a reasonable option for those cases. ","107":"The most common benign neoplasm of the pharynx is papilloma. It is characterized by bulging brittle lesions, which are pedicled or sessile, whitish-grey or pinkish colour. Progressive hoarseness is the main clinical feature. When the papillomata spread throughout the tracheobronchial tree symptoms such as chronic cough, stridor, dyspnea or acute respiratory distress are mostly present. Hemoptysis as a presenting symptom is exceptionally rare in patients with pharyngeal papillomatosis. Herein, we report a case of pharyngeal papillomatosis in which hemoptysis was the primary clinical manifestation. The clinical and therapeutic aspects of the disease are briefly discussed.","108":"Primary hepatic leiomyosarcoma is an extremely rare type of liver sarcoma with relatively poor prognosis, with about 50 cases having been reported in the literature. Potential origins of this tumor in the liver are the smooth muscle cells in the round ligament, intrahepatic blood vessels and intrahepatic bile ducts. There is no apparent sex predilection and there is a wide age range. The clinical presentation is not specific and the diagnosis depends on the expression of markers such as smooth muscle actin, desmin and vimentin by tumor cells. Herein, we present a case of a bulky primary hepatic leiomyosarcoma in a 68-year-old female patient. The patient underwent resection of the exophytic mass en block with the hepatic segments III and IVB. Surgical resection is the most effective among the treatment options. ","109":"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), one of the most aggressive malignancies, is extremely rare in childhood. We present a case of 5-yearold child who presented with rapidly progressing thyroid swelling and stridor, for which she underwent emergency tracheostomy and biopsy. Histopathological features were suggestive of ATC and the patient died within two months after diagnosis. ATC, though very rare in childhood, should be kept in the differential diagnoses of rapidly enlarging neck masses in children. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest case of ATC reported in literature.","110":null,"111":"We examined the histological features of the mucobuccal fold of oral cavity mucous membrane from the area of the masticatory teeth roots' projection in 6-month-old Wistar Albino Glaxo rats with fetal macrosomia. The animals were divided into groups according to the body weight, the body length, and the Quetelet index at birth. A morphological study was performed using the Leica SP8 AOBS laser scanning confocal microscope and a conventional light (Axiostar, Zeiss) microscopy. Morphometric parameters were used to estimate the degree of acanthosis development in the epithelium of the oral mucosa, which indicates the intensity of its proliferation. Numerous narrow and deep acanthotic outgrowths and densely located 'juvenile' epitheliocytes in the basal layer on the apex of the acanthotic protrusions were found in animals with fetal macrosomia that was due to intrauterine obesity. In these animals, the morphometric index, which we used, was maximally different from that in the control group. In animals with fetal macrosomia that was due to intrauterine growth acceleration of the body, the hyperproliferation of the mucous membrane epithelium of the oral cavity was absent or little pronounced. It can be assumed that fetal macrocosmia with obesity causes instability in the epithelium of the oral cavity mucosa, its rapid death, and therefore, a more active stimulation of proliferation.","112":null,"113":null,"114":"It is common knowledge that there are patients who have an uncomplicated cataract surgery with an actual improvement of their visual acuity, but they are dissatisfied with their final visual capacity. It is hypothesized that patients' preoperative expectations play a significant role in their postoperative perceptions. A systematic review of the recent literature regarding preoperative expectations of patients before lens extraction surgery and their postoperative perceptions as regards the visual outcome was performed based on the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, American Academy of Ophthalmology, Nature and Springer databases in September 2017 and data from 14 descriptive and 7 comparative studies were included in this narrative review. The objective of this review is the determination of the relationship between preoperative expectations and postoperative perception of visual outcome, as well as the investigation of predictors of patient satisfaction by understanding the factors that determine preoperative patient expectations. A considerable number of studies evaluate patient expectations before cataract surgery and compare them with postoperative patient perceptions. In conclusion, the final patient's postoperative perception could be affected both by the actual outcome of the operation and by patient preoperative expectations. Ocular and systemic comorbidity, unrealistic expectations, preoperative spectacle independence, the cost of surgery, and a previous cataract surgery as well as the level of health literacy and age could influence preoperative expectations and predict more accurately patient satisfaction. Taking these factors into consideration could allow surgeons to control the expectations with an extensive preoperative counseling.","115":"Duodenal Switch procedure is a type of bariatric surgery that was reserved for severely morbid obese people. Patients undergoing this procedure are at high risk for nutrient deficiencies. In this report we present a case of a patient who had developed polyneuropathy, generalized muscle weakness, Wernicke encephalopathy, myocardial dysfunction and pericardial effusion six years following this operation. He was treated by multivitamins and trace elements with a complete resolution of all of these disturbances. The patient was fully rehabilitated.","116":"Bochdalek hernia (BH) in an adult may manifest clinically with a myriad of abdominal or chest symptoms or a combination of them. Diagnosis of an adult BH is usually delayed in view of rarity of the lesion and its varied presentation. A 30-year-old adult gentleman presented to us with a left thoracostomy which was draining pus and ingested food particles. The tube thoracostomy had been performed in another hospital for an apparent left hydropneumothorax before he arrived in our hospital. Computed tomography of Chest and abdomen revealed a left diaphragmatic defect with herniation of stomach, spleen and omentum into the chest with organo-axial volvulus of the stomach. A thoracostomy tube was seen to be traversing through the stomach with its tip located close to the left pulmonary artery. The patient underwent left thoraco-abdominal exploration with dissection and reposition of the hernial contents in the abdominal cavity. The gastric perforations and the diaphragmatic defect were repaired. This case reiterates a well-known fact that an adult type BH must find a place in the differential diagnosis of a hydropneumothorax. Though the adult BH is a rare diagnosis, unawareness or reluctance to consider the possibility of adult BH may prolong the suffering of the patient as it happened in our patient who had iatrogenic perforation of the stomach due to tube thoracostomy.","117":"This retrospective clinical study would like to objectively denote a quality of life of persons afflicted by an abdominal catastrophe and managed by an extensive surgery can be almost as well conformable as those of healthy people in a similar age group. A set of eighteen patients who were successfully surgically treated and cured enjoyed a relatively good convalescence after their surgery and returned to a satisfactory standard of life from the point of view of organ function and psychosomatic state. Statistical analysis of the data collected over a period of 1 to 6 years after this complex therapy using special questionnaire for QOL assessment SF-36 was performed. Almost half of the patients evaluated their state similarly to the rest of the population of comparable age and general health status. The remainder of the patients declared significantly worse evaluations in the majority of the observed domains of the questionnaire. Therapy of these patients was and must be complex: it included preparation for surgery at a special metabolic internal site, careful diagnostics of the digestive tract state, suitable surgery and good quality care after the surgery. ","118":"The development of the new technologies such as the next-generation sequencing (NGS) makes more accessible the diagnosis of genetically heterogeneous diseases such as Lynch syndrome (LS). LS is one of the most common hereditary form of colorectal cancer. This autosomal dominant inherited disorder is caused by deleterious germline mutations in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes - MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2, or the deletion in the EPCAM gene. These mutations eventually result in microsatellite instability (MSI), which can be easily tested in tumor tissue. According to the actual recommendations, all patients with CRC that are suspect to have LS, should be offered the MSI testing. When the MSI is positive, these patients should be recommended to genetic counseling. Here we report a pilot study about the application of NGS in the LS diagnosis in patients considered to have sporadic colorectal cancer. The inclusion criteria for the NGS testing were MSI positivity, BRAF V600E and MHL1 methylation negativity. We have used 5 gene amplicon based massive parallel sequencing on MiSeq platform. In one patient, we have identified a new pathogenic mutation in the exon 4 of the MSH6 gene that was previously not described in ClinVar, Human Gene Mutation Database, Ensembl and InSight databases. This mutation was confirmed by the Sanger method. We have shown that the implementation of new criteria for colorectal patients screening are important in clinical praxis and the NGS gene panel testing is suitable for routine laboratory settings.","119":"An acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a crucial event in patients' life and connected with serious morbidity and mortality. Regarding a high case-fatality rate, early and accurate risk-stratification is crucial. Risk for mortality and complications are closely related to hemodynamic stability and cardiac adaptations. The currently recommended risk-stratification approach is not overall simple to use and might delay the identification of those patients, who should be monitored more closely and may treated with more aggressive treatment strategies. Additionally, some risk-stratification criteria for the imaging procedures are still imprecise. Summarized, the search for the most effective risk-stratification tools is still ongoing and some diagnostic criteria might have to be refined. In the MAinz Retrospective Study of Pulmonary Embolism (MARS-PE), overall 182 consecutive patients with confirmed PE were retrospectively included over a 5-year period. Clinical, echocardiographic, functional and laboratory parameters were assessed. The study was designed to provide answers to some of the mentioned relevant questions.","120":null,"121":"To evaluate the presence of endothelial dysfunction in Slovak children with juvenile psoriatic arthritis in the absence of classic cardiovascular risk factors in order to assess its relationship to the disease activity and disability. 25 juvenile psoriatic arthritis patients (JPSA) and 25 healthy controls aged 6-19 years were enrolled into this study. In all subjects vascular measurements over a period of three years (January 2013 - January 2016) were performed, in accordance with the guidelines for ultrasonographic evaluation of FMD% (flow-mediated endothelial dependent vasodilatation) of the brachial artery. The measured items were compared to the variables reflecting the disease activity and disability. Significantly lower FMD% values in patients with JPSA when compared to healthy controls {mean(SD), median, range: 5.49% (3.77), 3.55, 0.3-13.0 vs. 9.28% (1.72), 9.3, 6.4-13.1} (p &lt; 0.001) have been documented. Strong correlations between FMD% values and disease duration (p &lt; 0.01), non-specific inflammatory markers levels (p &lt; 0.001) or functional disability (p &lt; 0.01) have been observed. Significantly lower FMD% values in patients with an early disease onset (JPSA onset &lt; 5 years of age) when compared to the rest of JPSA group {mean (SD), median, range: 4.39% (2.47), 4.45, 0.9-13.2 vs. 6.38% (1.42), 6.3, 3.2-12.1} (p &lt; 0.01) have also been detected. Study is the only one addressing endothelial dysfunction development in Slovak children with psoriatic arthritides. We state that endothelial dysfunction is present in these patients even during childhood and in the absence of classic cardiovascular risk factors. Its development seems to be related to an early disease onset as well as to the increased disease activity and disability. Potential genetic predictors have also been identified. ","122":"Causality of marijuana abuse with development of ischemic stroke has been indicated by numerous case reports and epidemiological studies. As a possible pathophysiological mechanism, the most common consideration is cardiac embolization during paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, systemic hypotension or multifocal intracerebral vasoconstriction. We present three case reports of marijuana consumers who were admitted to our comprehensive stroke center due to ischemic stroke within 18-month period of our investigation. In one case, the cause of stroke was not related to the use of marijuana, it was a manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome. In two cases the association with the abuse of this drug is probable but not certain. In both these cases, an isolated occlusion in vertebrobasilar arterial system was detected, without finding of a cerebral vessels stenosis. Although we did not register the atrial fibrillation, we consider cardiac embolization as probable etiological mechanism of stroke in both cases. In one case, paradoxical embolization due to the persistent foramen ovale represents another potential etiological mechanism. Cannabinoid use may cause ischemic stroke, especially in the younger age category. Therefore, in these patients we recommend focusing on the history of cannabinoid abuse and carry out toxicological urine tests. ","123":"Lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition where the neural structures are compressed in the narrowed spinal canal and often situated only within a single specific segment of the spine, most frequently in the lumbar spine. A case report demonstrates a surgical solution of lumbar spinal stenosis with using oxidized cellulose as a prevention of post-operative adhesions and failed back syndrome. A female patient (68) with a significant pain of the lumbar spine lasting for a number of months due to advanced spondylosis, failing to respond to conservative treatment underwent instrumented, posterolateral fusion of affected segments. The patient re-arrived with pain due to spinal stenosis in another segments after 4 and then after 3 years. We repeatedly performed spinal fusion of the affected segments and applied an antiadhesive gel to the dural sac and the decompressed nerve roots to prevent the development of post-operative adhesions and the \"failed back syndrome\". Last surgical solution included mobilisation of the simultaneously constricted dural sac through laminectomy. This time we covered the sac using a haemostat made of oxidized cellulose (Traumacel FAM). After this treatment, the patient was again without significant difficulties.","124":"Variations in the branching pattern of axillary artery are observed by many anatomists all over the world. A unique bilateral variation in the axillary artery was observed during the routine dissection of the upper limbs on an approximately 65 year old male cadaver. An abnormal communicative channel was observed between lateral thoracic artery and anterior circumflex humeral artery. It passed between the two roots of median nerve. Arterial anomalies in the upper limb are due to defective remodelling of vascular plexus of the upper limb bud during embryogenesis. Knowledge of variations in axillary artery is quintessential for surgeons, radiologists and anaesthesiologists to avoid treacherous complications during procedures.","125":"Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pPNET) are a group of extremely rare, aggressive, malignant tumors that are most often found in the thorax (Askin tumor), abdomen, pelvis, extremities and less frequently in the head and neck. The most important prognostic factor is the stage of the tumor. Significant progress both in surgery and in neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as well as the improvement in diagnosis by cytogenetic and immunohistochemical analysis, should improve the survival rate. We report a case of a 14-year-old girl, with ataxic gait, cardiopulmonary compensated, without respiratory symptoms, who was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment of newly discovered tumor of the left hemithorax. After a detailed radiological and laboratory investigation, next step was an extensive thoraco-neurosurgical surgery. After histopathological, cytological and molecular analysis, a diagnosis of Askin tumor was made.","126":"Radiotherapy with systemic corticosteroid therapy has been used to treat intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISCM), but recovery of function and long-term survival of these patients has been rarely observed. We report herein a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patient with recurrent thoracic ISCM, who was successfully treated with radiotherapy and systemic corticosteroid therapy. A 70-year-old man, who was diagnosed as having SCLC seven months previously, developed thoracic ISCM. Soon after the detection of the lesion, the patient received radiotherapy with systemic corticosteroid therapy. Sensory disturbance in both extremities and neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction was recovered. The patient could walk after irradiation again. The patient received additional chemotherapy and survived 20 months after the diagnosis of ISCM recurrence. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment for ISCM and effective chemotherapy for recurrent SCLC might be the favorable factors for such patients. Further studies will be required to define a favorable subset of patients most likely to benefit from a conventional approach.","127":null,"128":"Introduction-Aim: Newer methods, such as infrared digital pupillometry and electrodermal activity (EDA) measurement have been suggested as good alternatives for analgesia monitoring in critically ill patients. This study analyzed EDA changes due to pain stimulus in sedated adult critical care patients Methods: Skin conductance variability, selected hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, Bispectral index (BIS) and ambient noise level, were monitored during 4 hour routine daytime in an adult ICU. 4h-Measurements were divided into 2 groups, based upon the sedation level of the patients: Group A - Ramsay Sedation Score 2-4 and Group B - Ramsay Sedation Score of 5-6. Selected recordings before and after pain stimulus were performed. The stimulus chosen was the pressure applied to nail bed for 10 sec, which was performed routinely during neurological examination. Patients' demographics, laboratory exams and severity scores were recorded. Pain status evaluation before every event was also performed by 2 independent observers via Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and Adult Non Verbal Pain Score (ANVPS) Results: In both groups the rate of EDA changes was greater than other monitoring parameters: more in Group A than in Group B. Yet, the difference between groups was not statistically significant. EDA measurements are greater to pain stimuli, than cardiovascular, respiratory or even BIS monitoring. These encouraging results suggest that, further studies are needed to better define EDA role in ICU. ","129":"The aim of this study is to describe an entity of primary hydrocele accompanied with fibrosis, thickening and hemorrhagic infiltration of parietal layer of tunica vaginalis (PLTV). During a 4-year period (2011-2014), 94 boys (2.5-14 years old) underwent primary hydrocele repair. Hydrocele was right sided in 55 (58.5 %), left sided in 26 (28.7%) and bilateral in 12 patients (13.8%). Eighty three out of 94 patients (88.30%) had communicating hydrocele and the rest eleven patients (11.7%) had non-communicating. Our case group consists of 8 patients (8.51%) based on operative findings consistent with PLTV induration, thickening and hemorrhagic infiltration. Preoperative ultrasonography did not reveal any pathology of the intrascrotal structures besides hydrocele. There weren't hyperechoic reflections or septa within the fluid. Evaluation of thickness of the PLTV was not feasible. Presence of lymph or exudate was excluded after fluid biochemical analysis. Tunica vaginalis histological examination confirmed thickening, hemorrhagic infiltration and inflammation, while there was absence of mesothelial cells. Immunochemistry for desmin was positive, excluding malignant mesothelioma. One patient underwent high ligation of the patent processus vaginalis and PLTV sheath fenestration, but one year later, he faced a recurrence. An elective second surgery was conducted via scrotal incision and Jaboulay operation was performed. The latter methodology was our treatment choice in other 7 out of 8 patients. During a 2-year postoperative follow-up, no other patient had any recurrence. We conclude that in primary hydrocele with macroscopic features indicative of tunica vaginalis inflammation, reversion of the tunica should be a part of operative strategy instead of sheath fenestration, in order to minimize the recurrence.","130":"The acute idiopathic scrotal edema (AISE) is a self-limited disease of unknown etiology, characterized by edema and erythema of the scrotum and the dartos, without expansion to the underlying layers of scrotum's wall or to the endoscrotal structures. Boys younger than 10 years old are usually involved in 60-90% of all cases. Diagnosis is made after exclusion of other causes of acute scrotum. We present a case of a 7-year old boy, who was admitted to the Emergency Department due to development of scrotal edema and erythema over the last 48 hours, which extended to the base of the penis. The patient mentioned that he first noticed the erythema on the anterior surface of the right hemiscrotum, which gradually extended. Physical examination did not reveal presence of pathology involving the endoscrotal structures, indicative of need for urgent surgical intervention. Transillumination was negative for blue dot sign. Ultrasonographic examination of the scrotum documented the homogeneity of the testicular parenchyma, while color Doppler revealed the presence of fountain's sign (equal arterial blood supply to both testicles). Conservative strategy was followed and the patient gradually improved within the next three days. In conclusion, meticulous physical examination along with ultrasonographic examination of the suffering scrotum, especially with the highlighting of fountain's sign with color Doppler, document the diagnosis of AISE. Thus, need for urgent surgical investigation of the suffering scrotum due to diagnostic doubt is limited.","131":"The incidence of a second branchial arch sinus accounts for 26-60% of all existing congenital malformations deriving from the branchial apparatus. They are most usually detected between 14 months and 7 years of age, while their incidence during neonatal period and infancy accounts for 0.06% of all cases. The aim of this case study is to emphasize three rare characteristic features: the manifestation during neonatal period, the bilateral localization and the ultrasonographic diagnostic documentation. A 25 days old girl was admitted by her parents due to the presence of mucoid excretion from two small openings found on the neck. These openings were found bilaterally, between the mid and lower third of the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle. Diagnosis was confirmed via ultrasonography. The patient underwent elective surgery during early infancy and both branchial fistulas were excised. Patient's postoperative course was uneventful. - in cases of a bilateral second branchial arch sinus, the branchio-oto-renal (BOR) or branchio-otic (BO) syndromes must be excluded; - ultrasound scan can be used for the thorough evaluation of the sinus anatomic course and the relationship with the adjacent anatomic structures; - rompt diagnosis and early therapeutic intervention, even during neonatal period, ensures an uneventful post-operation course. ","132":null,"133":"The aim of study was to evaluate impact of long-term dietary cholesterol overload on the cholesterol homeostasis and liver regeneration. Serum lipid parameters, 14C-cholesterol incorporation, liver DNA synthesis and protein expression was determined in partially hepatectomized (PH) rats fed with a standard (SLD) or hypercholesterolemic (CHOL) diet. 29-day intake of CHOL diet before PH produced increase in serum total cholesterol, LDL lipoprotein, and triglyceride concentration. PH provoked decrease in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentration in both groups. PH was associated with increase in serum ALT activity more pronounced in CHOL animals. Hepatic DNA synthesis was increased after PH in both groups, but lower in CHOL. Hypercholesterolemic diet reduced the absorption of radiolabelled cholesterol in intestine and then activity in blood and liver. The 14C-cholesterol hepatic activities tend to increase after PH in both groups. CHOL diet produced up-regulation of Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-2 protein expression. PH was associated with increase of LDL receptor and Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-2 protein expression in both dietary groups. Liver regeneration after PH is negatively influenced by CHOL diet. The increased uptake of cholesterol in the liver after PH associated with up-regulation of LDL receptor protein expression suggests preferential use of extrahepatic cholesterol by the liver. ","134":"CDC7 is a serine\/threonine kinase which has an essential role in initiation of DNA proliferation and S phase. It increases the invasion and proliferation in many pathologic lesions. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of CDC7 in the most common odontogenic cysts. We evaluated 17 dentigerous cysts, 18 odontogenic keratocysts (OKC) and 13 radicular cysts immunohistochemically. The mean expression of CDC7 was analyzed using ANOVA and Post-HOC methods. All specimens revealed CDC7 expression. Higher expression of CDC7 in OKC and radicular cyst was shown in comparison to dentigerous cyst (P &lt; 0.001), while radicular cyst and OKC groups showed no difference in CDC7 expression (P = 0.738). The high expression of CDC7 in OKC suggests that this protein could be related to the higher proliferation rate and invasiveness of OKC. On the other hand, the higher CDC7 expression in radicular cyst may simply be related to inflammation as this cyst is neither aggressive nor invasive.","135":"Analysis of Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a re-discovered approach to monitoring the course of the disease and reduce invasive methods of patient investigation. However, the major disadvantage and shortcoming of the EBC is lack of reliable and reproducible standardization of the method. Despite many articles published on EBC, until now there is no clear consensus on whether the analysis of EBC can provide a clue to diagnosis of the diseases. The purpose of this paper is to investigate our own method, to search for possible standardization and to obtain our own initial experience. Thirty healthy volunteers provided the EBC, in which we monitored the density, pH, protein, chloride and urea concentration. Our results show that EBC pH is influenced by smoking, and urea concentrations are affected by the gender of subjects. Age of subjects does not play a role. The smallest coefficient of variation between individual volunteers is for density determination. Current limitations of EBC measurements are the low concentration of many biomarkers. Standardization needs to be specific for each individual biomarker, with focusing on optimal condensate collection. EBC analysis has a potential become diagnostic test, not only for lung diseases.","136":"Nowadays, regenerative and reparative medicine has grown in popularity. Dental stem cells are easily accessible source of adult stem cells. They can be harvested by a tooth extraction or spontaneous deciduous tooth exfoliation. They have to be isolated, expanded and stored until time they would be needed for individual stem cell therapy. Cryopreservation is both a short-term and long-term storage of tissues or cells at sub-zero temperatures. There are several methods of cryopreservation requiring different technologies. The objective of this review is to compare them and highlight their advantages and disadvantages.","137":"Amyand's hernia is defined as an inguinal hernia, containing the appendix within the hernia sac. Incidence of this rare condition rises up to 1% (0.19-1.7%) of all inguinal hernia cases. Inflammation of the appendix within the inguinal sac is even rarer, as it corresponds to 0.1% (0.07-0.13%) of all Amyand's hernia cases. After a comprehensive review of the limited relevant literature, we aim through this review study to describe the pathophysiology of inflammation of the appendix - contained in the hernia sac - and present the latest data about the diagnostic approach and surgical treatment of Amyand's hernia.","138":"The umbilical cord hernia is the rarest form of abdominal wall malformations, anatomically completely different from gastroschisis and omphalocele. It occurs due to the permanent physiological evisceration of abdominal organs into umbilical celom and persistence of a patent umbilical ring. The umbilical cord hernia is often mistaken for omphalocele and called \"small omphalocele\". Here we present a case of a female newborn with umbilical cord hernia treated in our Hospital. After preoperative examinations surgery was done on the second day of life. The abdominal wall was closed without tension. The aim of this article is to present the importance of the proper diagnose of these three entities and to stimulate academic community for the answer, is this umbilical cord hernia or small omphalocele.","139":"We present a rare case of a patient with a persistent headache for many years found to have an intracranial nail present for nearly 65 years. The nail was found entering approximately 1 cm from the midline on the left side, passing below the superior sagittal sinus, with the tip 1.5 mm right of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. Treatment strategies designed to optimize outcome for intracranial foreign bodies and possible complications are discussed in this report. We also discuss the decision for surgical intervention for foreign bodies and the relevance of position of the foreign body.","140":"Testicular torsion is a urological emergency. If not recognized in time, this condition may result in ischaemic injury and loss of testis. Simultaneous bilateral neonatal testicular torsion is extremely rare and is usually misdiagnosed. We report a case of a male newborn, who presented with bilateral scrotal swelling and redness of the scrotum. Doppler ultrasound supported the diagnosis of bilateral testicular torsion, with an absent blood flow signal on the right side and a weak signal on the left side. Testicular exploration through scrotal incision was performed and bilateral testicular torsion was found. Right testis was grossly gangrenous, and right orchiectomy was performed. Left testicle was dark but showed recovery after detorsion with some bleeding from incised tunica albugenia. Fixation of the left testicle was performed. At six month follow-up, the left testis showed signs of atrophy and hormonal assay showed very low testosterone and elevated LH and FSH, suggesting hypogonadism. Management of neonatal testicular torsion is a matter of controversy. Testicular torsion results into acute ischemia and urgent surgical exploration is the key point of management. Although the possibility of salvaging the involved testicles is usually very low it is hard to justify a passive approach to a bilateral torsion resulting in such a devastating condition as anorchia. ","141":"This double blind randomized clinical trial was conducted with the purpose of evaluating the effects of Nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste as compared to 8% Arginine containing toothpaste in the management of Dentin hypersensitivity (DH). Patients (30 in each group) suffering from DH and eliciting a VAS score higher than 2 in air blast and tactile test were randomly allocated (block randomization) into either a group 1 (arginine toothpaste) or group 2 (nHA toothpaste). The primary outcome evaluated was the reduction of DH as measured by the electrical stimulus reading on the digital pulp tester. Current required for eliciting a VAS score of 2 was recorded before application of dentifrice. 1 cm of toothpaste was then expressed on the tooth surface for two minutes in each group and rinsed off. The electrical stimulus required to elicit a VAS score of 2 was recorded after 5 minutes, 1 week and 4 weeks. The desensitizing paste containing arginine provided a statistically significant reduction in DH and so did the paste containing nHA. Mean increase in amperage value (reduction in DH) was higher for nHA based than the arginine containing dentifrice. This difference was not statistically significant showing that both toothpastes are equally effective. The findings of the present study encourage the use of Nano-hydroxyapatite and arginine containing dentifrice as an effective desensitizing agent providing relief from symptoms 5 minutes after application and after 1 and 4 weeks.

It is also an extremely costly disease for healthcare systems unless managed effectively. In this review we aimed to: - Assess the effect of computer-assisted versus oral-and-written history taking on the quality of collected information for the prevention and management of CVD. - Assess the effect of computer-assisted versus oral-and-written history taking on the prevention and management of CVD. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials that included participants of 16 years or older at the beginning of the study, who were at risk of CVD (prevention) or were either previously diagnosed with CVD (management). We searched all major databases. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Two studies met the inclusion criteria. One comparing the two methods of history-taking for the prevention of cardiovascular disease n = 75. The study shows that generally the patients in the experimental group underwent more laboratory procedures, had more biomarker readings recorded and\/or were given (or had reviewed), more dietary changes than the control group. The other study compares the two methods of history-taking for the management of cardiovascular disease (n = 479). The study showed that the computerized decision aid appears to increase the proportion of patients who responded to invitations to discuss CVD prevention with their doctor. The Computer- Assisted History Taking Systems (CAHTS) increased the proportion of patients who discussed CHD risk reduction with their doctor from 24% to 40% and increased the proportion who had a specific plan to reduce their risk from 24% to 37%. With only one study meeting the inclusion criteria, for prevention of CVD and one study for management of CVD we did not gather sufficient evidence to address all of the objectives of the review. We were unable to report on most of the secondary patient outcomes in our protocol. We tentatively conclude that CAHTS can provide individually-tailored information about CVD prevention. However, further primary studies are needed to confirm these findings. We cannot draw any conclusions in relation to any other clinical outcomes at this stage. There is a need to develop an evidence base to support the effective development and use of CAHTS in this area of practice. In the absence of evidence on effectiveness, the implementation of computer-assisted history taking may only rely on the clinicians' tacit knowledge, published monographs and viewpoint articles.

Pseudoaneurysms can subsequently result in other complications, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, epistaxis, and caroticocavernous fistula with resultant death or permanent neurologic deficit. In this case, we illustrate endovascular treatment with a flow-diverting stent for an ICA pseudoaneurysm after endoscopic endonasal surgery for a pituitary adenoma in a 56-year-old male. Surgery was complicated by excessive intraoperative bleeding and emergent CT angiography confirmed an iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm on the anteromedial surface of the ICA. The pseudoaneurysm was treated endovascularly with flow-diverting stent implantation only. Follow-up CT angiography after three months demonstrated occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm.","146":"We present a case of severe calciphylaxis in both thighs and calves in a patient with end-stage renal disease and advanced secondary hyperparathyroidism with successful outcome after modified therapeutic approach. The cause of calciphylaxis is multifactorial. In our case, not only severe hyperparathyroidism and mediocalcinosis, but also medication (warfarin, calcium and active vitamin D) was involved. Because the initial conservative therapy was not successful, we indicated parathyroidectomy. However, we were not able to localize parathyroid glands and we contraindicated bilateral neck exploration due to the patient's critical status. Therefore, we decided for total thyroidectomy with total parathyroidectomy. Surgery was uncomplicated and histology confirmed that all four parathyroid glands were removed. The expected post-operative hypocalcaemia was asymptomatic and we did not use any calcium supplementation or vitamin D. Thyroid hormone replacement was easy. After surgery, the large and multiple subcutaneous defects started to heal. We achieved complete healing within several months of continuing dedicated care. There is no recurrence after three years. Prompt and radical surgical parathyroidectomy was extremely useful in our patient.","147":"To date, there are no sufficient data to make firm recommendations on the treatment of patients with severe thrombocytopenia who require antiplatelet therapy after experiencing acute coronary syndrome. Therefore, we think that it is important to communicate the experience with individual cases. We report the case of a patient who presented with pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. He had thrombocytopenia associated with myelodysplastic syndrome, and ten weeks before this admission, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with implantation of drug-eluting stents was performed for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. Platelets in myelodysplastic syndromes are dysfunctional, which exacerbates bleeding from thrombocytopenia, and the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in these patients is challenging.","148":null,"149":"The aim of this study is to investigate the association between hepatic activity index (HAI) and fibrosis score (FS) with inflammation biomarkers in non-uremic and uremic hepatitis C positive patients. Fifty chronic hepatitis C (cHepC) positive patients, having a liver biopsy were included in this study. Liver biopsies were scored according to modified ISHAC scoring system. 25 healthy controls of similar age and gender were also enrolled as control group. Serum YKL-40, neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), thrombocyte\/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), CRP and Immunoglobulin (IgG, A and M) levels were used to determine inflammation. AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) score was also evaluated. According to biopsy findings patients were divided into 2 groups: low (0-2) and severe (3-6) FS. Patients with cHepC had increased inflammation compared to the healthy controls. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients had higher levels of inflammation markers (NLR, IgG, CRP and YKL-40) and lower HCV RNA levels, HAI and FS compared to non-uremic patients. When patients were grouped into 2 according to FS as mild and severe, IgG (p &lt; 0.001), YKL-40 (p = 0.02) levels and APRI score (p = 0.002) were significantly higher compared to mild FS (p = 0.002). YKL-40 levels (t value: 3.48; p = 0.001) and APRI score (t value: 4.57, p &lt; 0.001) were found as independent associated with FS in non-uremic patients. However, in adjusted models, only APRI score (t value: 3.98, p = 0.002) was an independent associated with FS in ESRD patients. In non-uremic cHepC patients, YKL-40 levels and APRI score may be valuable markers of FS. In ESRD patients, there is not sufficient data for prediction of HAI and FS. In these patients, APRI score may provide better information. ","150":null,"151":"The live birth sex ratio is defined as male\/total births (M\/F).

The ICBN represents the lateral undivided cutaneous branch of second intercostal nerve. In this case, the ICBN formed nerve loops with branches of the lateral cutaneous branch of the third intercostal nerve. These loops eventually gave branches that probably supplied the floor of the axilla and proximal arm. Nowadays, this ICBN is gaining clinical importance during the axillary lymph node dissections and mammary gland surgeries. Damage to the ICBN, may results in the sensory deficits in patients undergoing surgery. In our case report, ICBN was making aberrant nerve loop along with the branches from the third intercostal nerve. Knowledge regarding the origin, formation and route of ICBN is of clinical significance to axillary surgeons, radiologist and anesthesiologists.","154":null,"155":"P120(ctn) is a specific membranous adhesion protein, that maintains the stability of intercellular junctions. An altered expression of p120(ctn), either reduced in the cell membrane or increase in the cytoplasm, plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis. No research has analysed the expression of p120(ctn) in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin so far. Therefore, we immunohistochemically studied p120(ctn) in a set of cutaneous BCCs in order to determine, whether there is difference in the expression pattern related to the histologic subtypes and tumor growth characteristics. The study group consisted of 38 BCCs cathegorized into low-risk (non-infiltrative) subroup (8 superficial and 12 nodular subtypes) and high-risk (infiltrative) subgroup (10 nodular-infiltrative and 8 infiltrative subtypes). Specific monoclonal antibody against p120(ctn) was used for staining. Overall, there were 12 cases (31.6%) with normal preserved and 26 cases (68.4%) with abnormal p120(ctn) expression. In superficial, nodular, nodular-infiltrative and infiltrative subtypes, abnormal p120(ctn) immunoreactivity was found in 37.5% (3\/8), 41.7% (5\/12), 100% (10\/10) and 100% (8\/8), respectively. We have confirmed a strong correlation between the expression of p120(ctn) and both given, non-infiltrative and infiltrative BCC growth phenotypes. In the latter subgroup, almost all lesions showed diffusely reduced membranous staining, of which five also manifested an aberrant immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm. This cytoplasmic positivity occurred solely at the invasive front of the infiltrative tumor formations. Our results showed that decreased membranous expression of p120(ctn) was a frequent event in human cutaneous BCC and it was associated with infiltrative growth phenotype. Considering that nearly half of the BCCs with non-infiltrative growth pattern also exhibited reduced membranous expression, aberrant cytoplasmic immunoreactivity of p120(ctn), which was found exclusively in the high-risk BCC variants, can more reliably reflect and predict biological behaviour and malignant potential.

The evaluation of the effect of pharmacological pretreatment is based on the identification of changes of soman-induced toxicity that was evaluated by the assessment of its LD50 value and its 95% confidence limit using probitlogarithmical analysis of death occurring within 24 h after administration of soman. 6-chlorotacrine was only able to markedly protect mice against acute toxicity of soman. In addition, the pharmacological pretreatment with 6-chlorotacrine or compound 2 was able to increase the efficacy of antidotal treatment (the oxime HI-6 in combination with atropine) of soman-poisoned mice. The other newly prepared reversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (7-phenoxytacrine, compound 1) as well as commonly used pyridostigmine did not influence the efficacy of antidotal treatment.

Clinical assessments included measurement of severity of pain, fatigue and morning fatigue with visual analog scale (VAS), functional status with Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and anxiety\/depression with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). FMS was diagnosed in 22 of the 62 patients (36%), and 4 of the 40 healthy controls (10%) (p 0.05). EPS+ patients with FMS had higher fatigue levels, HAD and FIQ scores than EPS- patients, although statistically insignificant. HV durations were statistically longer in the EPS- subgroup (p &lt; 0.05) but other EPS data were similar. FMS frequency and HAD anxiety scores were found to be higher in patients with palpitation complaints. However, we found no association between arrhythmia, EPS parameters and FMS.

Our aim was to investigate of there is indeed any possible correlations between these factors and a possible increase in injury rates following thyroidectomy. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Statistical correlation was observed for a positive relationship between injury of the sympathetic nerve and thyroid malignancy surgery (p 2 = 74%) No statistical correlations were observed for a negative or positive relationship between injury of the sympathetic nerve and tumor size. There was also no statistically significant value observed for the correlation of the patients' age with the risk of sympathetic nerve injury (p = 0.388). Lack of significant correlation reported could be due to the small number of studies and great heterogeneity between them.","169":"Radial artery is an important consistent vessel of the upper limb.

In patient with thyroid nodules and an oncological history, the possibility of thyroid metastasis should be seriously considered. Despite the rarity of the metastasis of cervical carcinoma to the thyroid, it is difficult to say appropriate treatment approach for these lesions. When managing such patients, decision-making should balance the possibility of gaining long-term survival against estimation of the aggressiveness of the disease and its possible complications.

Most of those heterogeneous findings were detected in the small intestine (27\/31; 87%), like erosions and\/or multiple red spots, diminutive polyps and tiny vascular lesions. During a 36-month clinical follow-up, all these 42 healthy volunteers remained asymptomatic, with fully normal laboratory control. Significant part of healthy subjects had abnormal findings at wireless capsule endoscopy. These findings had no clinical relevance, as all these persons remained fully asymptomatic during a 36-month follow-up. Such an endoscopic appearance would be previously evaluated as \"pathological\". This is a principal report alerting that all findings of any control group of wireless capsule endoscopic studies must be evaluated with caution. ","174":"Double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) was introduced 15 years ago. The complications of diagnostic DBE are rare, acute pancreatitis is most redoubtable one (incidence about 0.3%). Hyperamylasemia after DBE seems to be a rather common condition respectively. The most probable cause seems to be a mechanical straining of the pancreas. We tried to identify patients in a higher risk of acute pancreatitis after DBE. We investigated several laboratory markers before and after DBE (serum cathepsin B, lactoferrin, E-selectin, SPINK 1, procalcitonin, S100 proteins, alfa-1-antitrypsin, hs-CRP, malondialdehyde, serum and urine amylase and serum lipase). Serum amylase and lipase rose significantly with the maximum 4 hours after DBE. Serum cathepsin and procalcitonin decreased significantly 4 hours after DBE compared to healthy controls and patients values before DBE. Either serum amylase or lipase 4 hours after DBE did not correlate with any markers before DBE. There was a trend for an association between the number of push-and-pull cycles and procalcitonin and urine amylase 4 hours after DBE; between procalcitonin and alfa-1-antitrypsin, cathepsin and hs-CRP; and between E-selectin and malondialdehyde 4 hours after DBE. We found no laboratory markers determinative in advance those patients in a higher risk of acute pancreatitis after DBE.","175":"In the current cadaveric study an unusual sizeable accessory phrenic nerve (APN) was encountered emerging from the trunk of the supraclavicular nerves and forming a triangular loop that was anastomosing with the phrenic nerve. That neural loop surrounded the superficial cervical artery which displayed a spiral course. The form of a triangular loop of APN involving the aforementioned artery and originating from the supraclavicular nerve to the best of our knowledge has not been documented previously in the literature. The variable morphological features of the APN along with its clinical applications are briefly discussed. ","176":"Pheochromocytoma and Ganglioneuroblastoma are separate diseases and a rare combination in which the diagnosis can only be confirmed by pathological examination after tumor excision. We reported here a case of ganglioneuroblastoma encapsulated in pheochromocytoma. The patient is a woman, 73 years old, hypertensive, with hypothyroidism, associated for 15 years with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, which had frequent complaints of low back pain. She underwent magnetic resonance and the findings were consistent with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. After surgery, anatomic, pathologic and immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma composed by small ganglioneuroblastoma representation with the identification of small focus of infiltration of the adrenal capsule and adipose tissue by pheochromocytoma. This rare association can instigate the discussion of methods of diagnosis, more effective and more appropriate treatments for each patient. ","177":"Transient splenial lesions of the corpus callosum are rare radiological findings first described in association with epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs and viral encephalitis. However, subsequently more cases were described associated with diverse clinical conditions. We describe a 13-year-old girl suffering from migraine with aura presenting with headache, right-sided hemiparesis and encephalopathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an ovoid lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The patient's neurological symptoms resolved within 3 days without therapy and the lesion disappeared in follow up magnetic resonance images obtained 3 weeks after the onset of the symptoms. Migraine with aura was considered to be the cause of the lesion. To our knowledge the present case is the first report of a pediatric patient with a diagnosis of migraine with aura presenting with hemiparesis and encephalopathy. A diagnosis of transient lesion of the corpus callosum should be suspected in patients with migraine with aura presenting with hemiparesis and encephalopathy. A mild course and a good prognosis might be expected in the presence of a splenial lesion of the corpus callosum. ","178":"In animal models, there was observed alteration of various physiological processes caused by microtraumas. Here reported experiment was aimed on the research of link between injection and development of an oxidative imbalance. Laboratory guinea pig was chosen as a suitable model for examining of the oxidative stress. Markers indicating oxidative homeostasis were assayed in the frontal, temporal and occipital brain lobe, cerebellum, liver, kidney, spleen and heart one hour after an intramuscular injection. Common biochemical parameters were measured in plasma samples as well. The most extensive effect was observed in the heart where the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value was more than twice increased after the injection. The level of carbonylated proteins was significantly elevated in the kidney and ferric reducing antioxidant power value was increased in the brain compartments. The enzyme activities in the organs were not influenced except the activity of superoxide dismutase, which was moderately decreased in the brain. In the plasma samples, there was observed increase of the blood urea nitrogen. The results showed significant the influence of the intramuscular injection on a development of an oxidative insult. The injection can be considered as an adverse effect with quite extensive stress consequences. ","179":"The aims of the study were: i) to compare circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) yields obtained by different manual extraction procedures, ii) to evaluate the addition of various carrier molecules into the plasma to improve ctDNA extraction recovery, and iii) to use next generation sequencing (NGS) technology to analyze KRAS, BRAF, and NRAS somatic mutations in ctDNA from patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Venous blood was obtained from patients who suffered from metastatic colorectal carcinoma. For plasma ctDNA extraction, the following carriers were tested: carrier RNA, polyadenylic acid, glycogen, linear acrylamide, yeast tRNA, salmon sperm DNA, and herring sperm DNA. Each extract was characterized by quantitative real-time PCR and next generation sequencing. The addition of polyadenylic acid had a significant positive effect on the amount of ctDNA eluted. The sequencing data revealed five cases of ctDNA mutated in KRAS and one patient with a BRAF mutation. An agreement of 86% was found between tumor tissues and ctDNA. Testing somatic mutations in ctDNA seems to be a promising tool to monitor dynamically changing genotypes of tumor cells circulating in the body. The optimized process of ctDNA extraction should help to obtain more reliable sequencing data in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. ","180":"A combination of low-dose thalidomide and corticosteroids is a treatment option for anaemic patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) who are not eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We describe the outcomes of 13 patients with PMF treated with thalidomide 50 mg daily in combination with prednisone 0.5 mg\/kg daily. Treatment responses were seen in 10\/13 (77%) patients with a median onset of therapeutic effect at 4 weeks (range 3-7 weeks) after treatment initiation. Improvements of anaemia and thrombocytopenia and reduction in splenomegaly were observed in 70%, 38%, and 30% of patients, respectively. Four of six initially transfusion-dependent patients became transfusion independent following the therapy. The median duration of treatment response was 18 months (range 3-35 months). The treatment was well tolerated, with only one patient discontinuing therapy due to toxicity. Responders included both patients with and without JAK2 V617F, and included patients with both newly diagnosed and longstanding PMF. Our retrospective analysis confirmed that the therapy with low-doses thalidomide with prednisone in patients with PMF achieves significant response rate in anaemia with low treatment toxicity. ","181":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. For long time it was considered as pure functional disorder, but in recent years, there were identified atrial locations, which are involved in the initiation and maintenance of this arrhythmia. These structural changes, so called remodelation, start at electric level and later they affect contractility and morphology. In this study we attempted to find a possible relation between morphological (scarring, amyloidosis, left atrial (LA) enlargement) and electrophysiological (ECG features) changes in patients with AF. We examined grossly and histologically 100 hearts of necropsy patients - 54 with a history of AF and 46 without AF. Premortem ECGs were evaluated. The patients with AF had significantly heavier heart, larger LA, more severely scarred myocardium of the LA and atrial septum, and more severe amyloidosis in both atria. Severity of amyloidosis was higher in LAs vs. right atria (RAs). Distribution of both fibrosis and amyloidosis was irregular. The most affected area was in the LA anterior wall. Patients with a history of AF and with most severe amyloidosis have more often abnormally long P waves. Finding of long P wave may contribute to diagnosis of a hitherto undisclosed atrial fibrillation. ","182":"The aim of our study was to assess whether simple steatosis impairs liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a standard diet (ST-1, 10% kcal fat) and high-fat diet (HFD, 71% kcal fat) for 6 weeks. Then the rats were submitted to 2\/3 PHx and animals were sacrificed 24, 48 or 72 h after PHx. Serum biochemistry, respiration of mitochondria in liver homogenate, hepatic oxidative stress markers, selected cytokines and DNA content were measured, and histopathological samples were prepared. Liver regeneration was evaluated by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to hepatocyte DNA. HFD induced simple microvesicular liver steatosis. PHx caused elevation of serum markers of liver injury in both groups; however, an increase in these parameters was delayed in HFD group. Hepatic content of reduced glutathione was significantly increased in both groups after PHx. There were no significant changes in activities of respiratory complexes I and II (state 3). Relative and absolute liver weights, total DNA content, and DNA synthesis exerted very similar changes in both ST-1 and HFD groups after PHx. PHx-induced regeneration of the rat liver with simple steatosis was not significantly affected when compared to the lean liver.

In particular, the median nerve was formed by five roots; three roots originated from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus joined individually the median nerve's medial root. The latter (fourth) root was united with the lateral (fifth) root of the median nerve forming the median nerve distally in the upper arm and not the axilla as usually. In addition, the median nerve was situated medial to the brachial artery. We review comprehensively the relevant variants, their embryologic development and their potential clinical applications. ","185":"Still's disease is an inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. First-line therapy is based on corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but the frequency of relapses and corticosteroid-induced adverse events are limiting factors. The efficacy of intravenous tocilizumab (TCZ) has been shown at a dose of 8 mg\/kg but the corticosteroid-sparing effect of intravenous low-dose TCZ followed by subcutaneous (SC) injection in the course of the disease has been poorly investigated. We report the case of a 28-year old Caucasian woman presenting a relapse of Still's disease eleven months after diagnosis under treatment with 6 mg of methylprednisolone. TCZ at a dose of 4 mg\/kg every 2 weeks was combined with 32 mg of methylprednisolone, followed by 162 mg SC every 3 weeks. Evolution was rapidly favourable with a decrease in corticosteroid doses.

A patient with gastric metastasis as the first symptom of lobular breast carcinoma, treated by neoadjuvant preoperative chemoradiotherapy and total gastrectomy, with complete local control. Fourteen months after presentation of the gastric metastasis a primary lobular breast carcinoma was discovered, treated by radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal treatment with complete local response. Twenty-three months after diagnosis of breast cancer multiple colorectal metastases from the breast cancer occurred, which were treated by chemotherapy and hormonal treatment. Eighty-six months after diagnosis of gastric metastasis the patient died due to progression of cancer. Metastases to gastrointestinal or gynaecological tracts are more likely in invasive lobular carcinoma than invasive ductal cancer. The pathologist should determine whether or not they check estrogen and progesterone receptor status not simply by signet ring cell morphology but also by consideration of clinic-pathological correlation of the patient, such as the presence of a past history of breast cancer, or the colorectal localization of poorly differentiated carcinoma, which may occur less frequently than in the stomach.

Both of these cause collagen remodeling in the dermis and neo-collagen formation resulting in facial rejuvenation. There is limited literature on the evaluation of collagen remodeling by objective methods. To compare the benefits of monopolar radiofrequency and glycolic acid peels in facial rejuvenation with regards to histopathology and Ultrabiomicroscopic sonography (UBM). In this study, forty patients with mild to moderate photoaging received four treatments with 3 weeks interval of monopolar radiofrequency on one side of face and glycolic acid peels in increasing concentrations (NeostrataR) on the other side. Pre and post treatment, 2 mm biopsies were taken from both preauricular areas and Ultrasonography using a 35 MHz probe was done from outer canthus of eye and nasolabial folds from both sides of face. A blinded assessment was done to measure the increase in the grenz zone and dermal thickness. In 35\/40 patients there was a significant increase in the grenz zone on histopathology and decrease in subepidermal low-echogenic band (SLEB) on UBM of the nasolabial folds on both sides of the face (p &lt; 0.05).

In the present study; 121 patients, who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty were examined retrospectively. SFAR of all patients were recorded. The graft success rates of 26 patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and 95 patients with no allergic rhinitis group (NAR) were compared. While the graft success rate in NAR group was 89.5%, this rate was 80.8% in the AR group. However, the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.311). These findings suggest that allergic rhinitis decreases the graft success rate of the pathologies occurring in eustachian tube, middle ear and mastoid although statistically significant difference wasn't found. Prospective studies with larger patient groups are required in order to evaluate this pathology.

We report case of intestinal obstruction and fistula formation following ingestion of 25 magnets in a 2-year-old girl. Intraoperatively omega shaped intestinal loop with fistula caused by two magnetic balls was found. Intestine trapped with magnetic balls was edematous and inflamed. Resection of intestinal segment was performed, followed by entero-enteric anastomosis. A total of 25 magnets were removed from resected intestine. Single magnet ingestion is treated as non-magnetic foreign body. Multiple magnet ingestion should be closely monitored and surgical approach could be the best option to prevent or to cure its complications.

In patients older than 14 years old their prevalence is doubled. After systematic and thorough research of the current literature, we did not find another case report of intraparenchymal epididymal cyst with similar dimensions. The male patient, 15 years old, visited our outpatient department complaining of pain in the right hemiscrotum. Diagnosis of IEC was confirmed after the conduction of ultrasound examination. Patient underwent surgical exploration of the right hemiscrotum. Resection of the IEC followed. Postoperative course was uneventful, with recession of the symptoms. In our opinion, IECs should be surgically removed, either when they are symptomatic or when they are asymptomatic, but of a diameter greater than 1 cm and without regression tendency.","192":"We measured postoperative anxiety in patients who underwent transseptal suturing or nasal packing after septoplasty. Transseptal suturing was performed on Group 1 patients and nasal splints with airway were placed after septoplasty in Group 2 patients. Postoperative 48-h anxiety levels of both groups were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) clinical assessment scale, prior to removal of nasal packing in Group 2. Transseptal suturing was performed after septoplasty in 28 patients and nasal packing in 34 patients. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory clinical assessment state (STAI-S) and trait (STAI-T) instruments were used to measure postoperative anxiety. The STAI-S scores were found 35.00 in the transseptal suturing group and 43.8 in the nasal packing group; the difference was found significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The STAI-T scores were found 42.6 in the transseptal suturing group and 45.7 in the nasal packing group; the difference was not found significant (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The rate of minor hemorrhage was found 10.7% in Group 1 patients. Transseptal suturing is simple and reliable when performed after septoplasty.

The World Health Organization states that dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the best densitometric technique for assessing bone mineral density (BMD). DXA provides an accurate diagnosis of osteoporosis, a good estimation of fracture risk, and is a useful tool for monitoring patients undergoing treatment. Common mistakes in BMD testing can be divided into four principal categories: 1) indication errors, 2) lack of quality control and calibration, 3) analysis and interpretation errors, and 4) inappropriate acquisition techniques. The aim of this retrospective multicenter descriptive study is to identify the common errors in the application of the DXA technique in Turkey. All DXA scans performed during the observation period were included in the study if the measurements of both, the lumbar spine and proximal femur were recorded. Forearm measurement, total body measurements, and measurements performed on children were excluded. Each examination was surveyed by 30 consultants from 20 different centers each informed and trained in the principles of and the standards for DXA scanning before the study. A total of 3,212 DXA scan results from 20 different centers in 15 different Turkish cities were collected. The percentage of the discovered erroneous measurements varied from 10.5% to 65.5% in the lumbar spine and from 21.3% to 74.2% in the proximal femur. The overall error rate was found to be 31.8% (n = 1021) for the lumbar spine and 49.0% (n = 1576) for the proximal femur. In Turkey, DXA measurements of BMD have been in use for over 20 years, and examination processes continue to improve.

Signs and symptoms of reversible syndrome of the splenium of the corpus callosum typically include disorientation, confusion, impaired consciousness, and epileptic seizures. A previously healthy 32-year-old man suffered from weakness, headache, and fever. Subsequently, he developed apathy, ataxia, and inability to walk, and therefore was admitted to the hospital. Cerebrospinal fluid showed protein elevation (0.9 g\/l) and pleocytosis (232\/1 ul). A brain MRI showed hyperintense lesions in the middle of the corpus callosum. The patient was treated with antibiotics, and subsequently, in combination with steroids. Two months later, the hyperintense lesions in the splenium and the basal ganglia had disappeared. Almost seven months since his hospitalization in the Department of Neurology, the patient has returned to his previous employment. He now does not exhibit any mental changes, an optic edema and urological problems have improved. In addition, he is now actively engaged in sports. We have described a case of a 32-year-old man with confusion, ataxia, and inability to stand and walk. The man developed a febrile meningeal syndrome and a hyperintense lesion of the splenium, which lasted for two months.

Although the effectiveness of a bonding system and any unfavorable effects on the enamel may be studied by conducting in-vivo studies, it is nearly impossible to independently analyze different variables that influence a specific bonding system in the oral environment. In-vitro studies, on the other hand, may utilize more standardized protocols for testing different bonding systems and materials available. Thus, the present review focused attention on in-vitro studies and made an attempt to discuss material-related, teeth-related (fluorotic vs non-fluorotic teeth) and other miscellaneous factors that influences the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets. Within the limitations of this review, using conventional acid-etch technique, ceramic brackets and bonding to non-fluorotic teeth was reported to have a positive influence on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets, but higher shear bond strength found on using ceramic brackets can be dangerous for the enamel.

Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is a liposomal form of the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin. It is characterized by more convenient pharmacokinetics and a different toxicity profile. Cardiotoxicity, the major adverse effect of conventional doxorubicin, is reduced in PLD as well as hematotoxicity, alopecia, nausea and vomiting. Skin toxicity and mucositis, however, emerge as serious issues since they represent dose and schedule-limiting toxicities. The pharmacokinetics of PLD (prolonged biological half-life and preferential distribution into tumor tissue) provide new possibilities to address these toxicity issues. The extracorporeal elimination of circulating liposomes after PLD saturation in the tumor tissue represents a novel and potent strategy to diminish drug toxicity. This article intends to review PLD characteristics and the importance of extracorporeal elimination to enhance treatment tolerance and benefits. ","216":"Capsular bag distension syndrome is a very rare complication of cataract surgery. Most cases occur after uneventful phacoemulsification with continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis and implantation of an intraocular lens in the capsular bag. The entity presents with reduction of visual acuity and myopic shift in the early-to-late postoperative period. Characteristic findings include the distension of the capsular bag due to the accumulation of milky material and the forward displacement of the intraocular lens. We present two cases with an unusually delayed presentation of 6 and 8 years respectively following phacoemulsification, and describe their successful management with Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy.

The first objective of this work was to determine the prevalence of aspirin resistance in neurovascular patients with clinical non-responsiveness to aspirin treatment and a high-risk of atherothrombotic complications using two interpretable and independent methods (aggregation and PFA 100). The second objective was to find the correlation between both assays and to evaluate the results in groups at risk for various cerebrovascular diseases. Laboratory tests of aspirin resistance were performed in 79 patients with clinical non-responsiveness to aspirin treatment suffering from neurovascular diseases. Patients were divided into the two groups: expected low risk for aspirin resistance due to the first manifestation of a neurovascular disease (n = 34) and expected high risk due to the second clinical manifestation of a neurovascular disease (n = 45). The prevalence of aspirin resistance in both groups combined as determined by the PFA-100 and CPG techniques were 50.6% and 17.7%, respectively. No correlation was found between the two techniques. No significant prevalence of aspirin resistance was demonstrated by either method despite the heterogeneous pathophysiological mechanisms. However, we are presently unable to provide an accurate opinion on the value of laboratory test result or routine monitoring in clinical neurology. ","219":"A variety of anti-glaucomatous shunt designs have been proposed so far. This study evaluates the feasibility of a novel shunt design, the intra-scleral parathalamus implant (IPI), in a rabbit eye model. Ten healthy albino rabbits were included. Measurements of the IOP, using TonoPenXL, as well as ocular rigidity (OR) and aqueous outflow facility (AO), using a previously described methodology, were performed in both eyes of each animal. Subsequently, the IPI was implanted at the left eye of all animals whereas the right eye served as control. Measurements of IOP were repeated at weekly intervals for 2 months postoperatively whereas measurements of OR and AO were repeated at the 1st and 2nd postoperative week. The IOP decreased significantly whereas the AO increased significantly postoperatively at the operated eyes. A significant postoperative decrease in OR was also recorded at the operated eyes. Respective differences at the fellow eyes were statistically not significant. Two animals developed postoperative complications and were excluded from follow-up. Results imply that the implantation of the IPI is feasible in rabbit eyes with significant favorable effects on the IOP, AO and OR. ","220":"High grade gliomas are some of the deadliest human tumours. Conventional treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have only a limited effect. Nowadays, resection is the common treatment of choice and although new approaches, such as perioperative magnetic resonance imaging or fluorescent microscopy have been developed, the survival rate of diagnosed patients is still very low. The inefficacy of conventional methods has led to the development of new strategies and the significant progress of nanotechnology in recent years. These platforms can be used either as novel imaging tools or to improve anticancer drug delivery into tumours while minimizing its distribution and toxicity in healthy tissues. Amongst the new nanotechnology platforms used for delivery into the brain tissue are: polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, nanoshells, carbon nanotubes, superparamagnetic nanoparticles and nucleic acid based nanoparticles (DNA, RNA interference [RNAi] and antisense oligonucleotides [ASO]). These nanoparticles have been applied in the delivery of small molecular weight drugs as well as macromolecules - proteins, peptides and genes. The unique properties of these nanoparticles, such as surface charge, particle size, composition and ability to modify their surface with tissue recognition ligands and antibodies, improve their biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. All of the above mentioned characteristics make of nanoplatforms a very suitable tool for its use in targeted, personalized medicine, where they could possibly carry large doses of therapeutic agents specifically into malignant cells while avoiding healthy cells. This review poses new possibilities in the large field of nanotechnology with special interest in the treatment of high grade brain tumours. ","221":"Interventions of paediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome are complex, varied and multidisciplinary. The goal of the treatment is to restore optimal breathing during the night and to relieve associated symptoms. Evidence suggests that the surgical intervention with removal of the tonsils and adenoids will lead to significant improvements in the most incomplicated cases, as recently reported from a meta-analysis. However, post-operative persistence of this syndrome in paediatric population is more frequent than expected, which supports the idea of the complexity of this syndrome. Adenotomy alone may not be sufficient in children with OSAS, because it does not address oropharyngeal obstruction secondary to tonsillar hyperplasia. Continuous positive airway pressure can effectively treat this syndrome in selected groups of children, improving both nocturnal and daytime symptoms, but poor adherence is a limiting factor. For this reason, CPAP is not recommended as first-line therapy for OSAS when adenotonsillectomy is an option. It is now being investigated the incorporation of nonsurgical approaches for milder forms and for residual OSAS after surgical intervention. Althought adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy is the most common for OSAS in children; obesity is emerging as an equally important etiological factor. Therefore an intensive weight reduction program and adequate sleep hygiene are also important lifestyle changes that may be very effective in mitigating the symptoms of this syndrome. Pharmacological therapy (leukotriene antagonists, topical nasal steroids) is usually use for mild forms of OSAS and in children with associated allergic diseases. Special orthodontic treatment and oropharyngeal exercises are a relatively new and promising alternative therapeutic modality used in selected groups of children with OSAS.

We describe a case, when a below-knee amputation was considered in a patient with chronic Charcot foot with a rocker-bottom deformity and chronic plantar ulceration. Conservative treatment failed. Targeted antibiotic therapy and operative management (Tendo-Achilles lengthening, resectional arthrodesis of Lisfranc and midtarsal joints, fixation with large-diameter axial screws, and plaster cast) were performed. On the basis of this case, we discuss options and drawbacks of surgical management. Our approach led to healing of the ulcer and correction of the deformity. Two years after surgery, we observed a significant improvement in patient's quality of life.

","227":"Crohn's disease is a chronic immune-mediated intestinal inflammation targeted against a yet incompletely defined subset of commensal gut microbiota and occurs on the background of a genetic predisposition under the influence of environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies have identified about 70 genetic risk loci associated with Crohn's disease. The greatest risk for Crohn's disease represent polymorphisms affecting the CARD15 gene encoding nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) which is an intracellular sensor for muramyl dipeptide, a peptidoglycan constituent of bacterial cell wall. The accumulated evidence suggests that gut microbiota represent an essential, perhaps a central factor in the induction and maintaining of Crohn's disease where dysregulation of normal co-evolved homeostatic relationships between intestinal microbiota and host mucosal immune system leads to intestinal inflammation. Taken together, these findings identify Crohn's disease as a syndrome of overlapping phenotypes that involves variable influences of genetic and environmental factors. A deeper understanding of different genetic abnormalities underlying Crohn's disease together with the identification of beneficial and harmful components of gut microbiota and their interactions are essential conditions for the categorization of Crohn's disease patients, which enable us to design more effective, preferably causative, individually tailored therapy.

Paranasal sinus tomography revealed a nasal mass in the left nasal cavity resembling a mucopyocele in the middle turbinate. Under general anesthesia, the purulent material was aspirated, and the lateral part of the left turbinate was resected. Mucopyoceles are common within the paranasal sinuses, but uncommon with CB; thus, they should be considered in patients with a large hyperemic nasal mass.

Eighty middle ears ossicles were examined in vivo and histologically to consider the relationship of cholesteatoma to ossicles, grade of bone destruction and invasion of cholesteatoma to deeper layers of bone. Serious ossicular destruction was observed more frequently in incus compared to malleus (p=0.0065). Difference of ossicles destruction between children and adults was not significant (p=0.3032). Deep invasion of cholesteatoma into the vascular spaces or inner core of the bone was not observed.

In both cases, the diagnosis was done by nasal endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses and supported by histopathological analysis. In the first patient, the excised polyp had the histological characteristic of an angiomatous antrochoanal polyp. Because of their unusual dimension, the combined transoral and endonasal endoscopic approach was performed for complete polyp excision.

There might be different causes of non-adherence in patients with dementia: memory impairment, sensory disturbances, limitations in mobility, economical reasons limiting access to health care and medication. Non-adherence leads to serious clinical consequences as well as being a challenge for public health. to estimate prevalence of non-adherence in seniors with dementia and to study correlation between cognitive decline and non-adherence. Prospective study, analyzing medical records of seniors with dementia admitted to the inpatient psychogeriatric ward in the Kromeriz mental hospital from January 2010 to January 2011. Cognitive decline measured by MMSE, prevalence of Non-adherence to treatment and reasons for patient Non-adherence were studied. Non-adherence to any treatment was detected in 31.3% of seniors; memory impairment was the most common cause of non-adherence to treatment. In conclusion, non-adherence to treatment in the studied group of seniors with dementia correlates with the severity of cognitive impairment - a higher cognitive decline correlates with a higher risk of non-adherence to treatment.

Patients and caregivers entering a rehabilitation program at a university hospital in Turkey. Ninety patients with a first episode of stroke and 90 caregivers responsible for their care were recruited for our study. Patients and caregivers were assessed before and after the active rehabilitation process. The functional disability level of the patients was assessed by Functional Independence Measure (FIM). The Beck Anxiety Scale (BAS) and the Beck Depression Scale (BDS) were used for anxiety and depression assessment, the Zarit Care Burden Scale (ZCBS) for care burden assessment and the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MDSPSS) for perceived social support assessment. A statistically significant rise is observed in the special person sub-assessment of MDSPSS in both female and male caregivers. Also, a significant decrease in care burden, anxiety and depression levels of caregivers was noted after the rehabilitation program (p &lt; 0.05). Caregivers accept the rehabilitation period as important social support in addition to the support provided by family and friends. Also, our positive results were associated with an improvement in the patients' functional level and an increase in the acquisition of knowledge and skill required of caregivers in order to provide care during rehabilitation.

Traditional markers (biochemical and inflammatory) and diagnostic tools could detect occlusive but not subclinical atherosclerosis. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), has recently been recognised as a non invasive diagnostic tool for identification of premature atherosclerosis. Therefore we evaluated 80 psoriasis patients and 80 age sex matched healthy controls for serum leptin levels and apolipoprotein B\/apolipoprotein A-I ratio (apoB\/apoA-I ratio) in relation with CIMT of carotid artery. Carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaques were simultaneously measured by carotid sonography. Serum concentration of leptin and apolipoprotein were measured using enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) and nephelometry respectively. Raised CIMT correlated to age of onset of the disease, serum leptin and apoB\/apoA-I ratio in psoriasis patients. Taking into account, values that were above the 75 percentile of the three markers (leptin, apoB\/apoA-I ratio and CIMT) the odds ratio was 4.26 (2.06-8.80 CI). Leptin and apoB\/apoA-I ratio showed significant cumulative association with CIMT.

Therefore, we followed by flow cytometry TLR2 and TLR4 expression on blood monocytes and granulocytes of patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using beating heart surgery (off-pump, n = 34), with use of standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), (on-pump, n = 30), and miniinvasive CPB (mini on-pump, n = 25), respectively, before, during surgery, and up to 7th postoperative day. TLR2 and TLR4 expression both on monocytes and granulocytes was significantly diminished already at the end of CPB being highly significantly decreased at the end of surgery in all patients' groups. TLR2 and TLR4 expression reached preoperative value at the 1st postoperative day being significantly higher at the 3rd postoperative day. Using intracellular staining we found the peak of TLR2 and TLR4 expression inside of monocytes and granulocytes at the first postoperative day in a subgroup of on-pump patients. In conclusion, TLR2 and TLR4 expression is significantly modulated in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting as a part of adaptive homeostatic mechanisms induced by major surgery. The very surgical trauma is responsible for TLR2 and TLR4 modulation. Surprisingly, cardiopulmonary bypass itself was little contributing to the modulation of TLR2 and TLR4 expression.","259":"We assessed the intensive care unit (ICU) patients for Invasive aspergillosis (IA) with culture and non-culture based diagnostic methods from Iran.

BAL samples were analyzed by microscopic examination, fungal culture and galactomannan (GM) detection. The Platelia Aspergillus GM EIA was used to quantify GM indices. Samples with a BAL GM index &gt; or = 1 were considered as positive for GM. Patients were classified as having probable or possible IA. Out of 36 suspected patients to IA, 36.1% of cases showed IA which were categorized as: 4 cases of possible IA and 9 of probable IA. 76.2% of BAL samples were positive for GM. From 13 patients with IA, 11 (84.6%) had at least one positive BAL GM index. Of these patients, 9 (81.8%) showed probable IA. The main underlying predisposing conditions were neutropenia (53.8%) and COPD (30.8%).

Static and cyclic mechanical loadings were performed. At first unused springs were tested. Afterwards the springs were mechanically stabilized by stress cycling and finally tested again. The difference in shape of the working curves was assessed. For simulation and description of the force degradation the modified Voight model was used. New springs, mainly those with large hysteresis, showed a significant stress-strain curve movement and shape changes during the cycling. The effect of the stress-strain curve course change disappeared fully in the stabilized springs. Multiple loading led to an overall decrease of force value during the measurement. The effect of force degradation and regeneration over time by simple static loading varies in the range of percentage of the nominal force in the plateau area. The transition between stress-strain curve phases caused by the degradation or regeneration of the force wasn't observed in case of mechanically stabilized springs. Springs should be mechanically stabilized before their application. The degree of force degradation over time is insignificant for mechanically stabilized springs. Degradation or regeneration of force over time, mechanical stabilization or micromovements in the mouth don't cause any transition between individual stress-strain curve phases.

Density separation was further performed to these groups in order to separate erythrocytes according to their age. Blood samples were used for the determination of erythrocyte deformability, aggregation; and oxidative stress parameters. Erythrocyte deformability of Yca group measured at 0.53 Pa was lower than Aca group. Similarly, deformability of least-dense (young) erythrocytes of Yca group was decreased compared to least-dense erythrocytes of Aca groups. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of Aca group was higher and oxidative stress index (OSI) lower than As group.

The aim of this study was to compare histopathological results obtained with punch biopsy and results obtained through one of the excisional techniques. We analysed histology results of 130 patients referred to our institution with abnormal smear. Punch biopsy was performed after colposcopic examination in all patients before one of the excision methods. Excision methods performed were: large loop excision of transformation zone (LLETZ), radio-frequency knife conisation or cold knife conisation. Based on the histopathological examination of the punch biopsy specimen or excisional specimen diagnosis of CIN was established. CIN and invasive cancer were the most common diagnoses in the 31-40 age group at 45.4% (59\/130). Discrepancies in the histological diagnosis between punch biopsy and excisional biopsy was identified in 58.5% (76\/130) of the patients. In 6% of the of the cases the biopsy did not detect an invasive carcinoma. The most frequent discrepancies between punch biopsy and excisional biopsy were in the group of patients with a higher grade cervical dysplasia. Mild dysplastic changes diagnosed through punch biopsy, require a more conservative approach, as the majority of this group had negative specimens on the cone after excision, especially in the younger population. It is advisable that the patients above 30 years of age and a higher grade dysplasia in the biopsy specimen, should undergo one of the excisional techniques as a diagnostic\/therapeutic method of treatment.

We routinely perform ASCT for newly diagnosed MM since 1996 in our department. We retrospectively analyzed all 285 transplants in 185 patients done for MM from January 1996 till December 2010. We analyzed overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) regarding conditioning, stage, complete or very good partial remission (CR, VGPR) achievement, renal impairment, single vs. double transplant. Estimated 10-years survival of the whole set of patients is 39% (median survival 95 months). Patients with renal impairment show same OS as those without (p = 0.22). Patients show similar overall survival and event free survival regardless of type of transplant. We observed better outcome in terms of overall survival in patients treated with new drugs (p = 0.0014). Reaching CR or VGPR was not translated into better OS (p = 0.30) and EFS (p = 0.10). Also stage of the disease and whether single or double transplant was used did not make any significant difference in the outcome. Stem cell transplantation greatly improved outcome of patients with MM. Poor outcome of allogeneic transplantation in our group of patients is related to high transplant related mortality (20% vs. 0%) and unexpected high relapse rate. There is a trend towards better survival, when new drugs are incorporated at any time in the course of the disease. This fact supports hypothesis that use of these drugs with ASCT should translate into better long-term outcome.

The disease is triggered in a susceptible individual through a process of uncontrolled inflammation leading to osteolysis, progressive fractures and articular malpositioning due to joint subluxations and dislocations. The progression of the chronic deformity with a collapsed plantar arch leads to plantar ulcerations because of increased pressure on the plantar osseous prominences and decreased plantar sensation. Subsequent deep soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis may result in amputation. The Charcot foot in diabetes represents an important diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. Conservative treatment remains the standard of the care for most patients with neuropathic disorder. Offloading the foot and immobilization based on individual merit are essential and are the most important recommendations in the active acute stage of the Charcot foot. Surgical realignment with stabilization is recommended in severe progressive neuropathic deformities consisting of a collapsed plantar arch with a rocker-bottom foot deformity.","270":"Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen is the primary cause of appendicitis. The most common causes of luminal obstruction are fecaliths and lymphoid follicle hyperplasia. Additionally, bacterial infections or enteric and systemic viral diseases can cause a reaction of the lymphoid follicle. An 11-year-old boy with active phase of chickenpox presented on our Pediatric surgery emergency department under the impression of acute appendicitis. An appendectomy was performed on the same day. An inflamed and edematous retrocecal appendix was removed during surgery. Histological investigation of the appendix revealed transmural acute inflammation, with diffuse proliferation of inflammatory cells, with characteristic intranuclear inclusion surrounded by a clear halo. The PCR analysis of peripheral blood and appendix tissue specimen revealed positive VZV DNA. We have shown that varicella-zoster virus infection of the appendix is associated with acute appendicitis and possibly also with severity of the disease. ","271":"Cemento-ossifying fibroma is a well-bordered, slow-growing, benign fibro-osseous disease. Although its localization is generally in the mandible, it can be seen in any area of the craniofacial region. Radiology and histopathology help to diagnose the condition. Treatment is based on close observation and\/or surgical excision. In this case, we report the case of a 62-year-old male patient who had a large radiological appearance, cemento-ossifying fibroma in the paranasal sinuses.","272":"","273":"Latitude gradients and secular trends in Europe and North America have been found in the male-female ratio at birth (M\/F: male births divided by total births) which is expected to be 0.515. Annual national data for Czechoslovakia and the post-Czechoslovakian (Czech Republic and Slovakia) countries for male and female live births were obtained from the World Health Organisation and analysed with contingency tables. This study analysed 13,123,538 live births. An overall decreasing trend in M\/F was found (p &lt; 00001). No latitude gradient was noted. There was an overall deficit of 15,232 male births based on an M\/F of 0.515. M\/F is declining in this region, despite well developing economies that have resisted the worldwide slowdown. An interplay of several poorly understood factors is likely.","274":"We studied influence of mud-bath on bone status in male Wistar rats with subchronic arthritis. Arthritis was induced by 2 subplantar injections of Freund's adjuvans with heat-killed Streptoccocus pyogenes into paw. Groups: intact (int) on chippings; (con) arthritis on chippings; (san38) arthritis on hot sand; (mu38) arthritis on hot mud; (mu21) arthritis on mild mud. Bone mineral density (BMD, g\/cm2) was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and femurs were tested biomechanically. Bone markers osteocalcin (OC), PINP and CTX were analysed in bone. BMD of right femur decreased vs. left in san38 (p = 0.030) and mu38 (p = 0.047). Fracture load of right\/left femur (N) decreased in experimental groups, significantly in san38 (p = 0.05). Fracture threshold of neck decreased in right vs. left in experimental groups, but significantly in san38 (p = 0.05). OC decreased in mu38 vs. con (1.84 +\/- 0.14\/2.62 +\/- 0.23). PINP decreased in int vs. san38 (p = 0.005) and mu21 (p &lt; 0.001). CTX decreased in int vs. mu38 (p = 0.006) and mu21 (p = 0.005). The hot bath appears indifferent in relation to osteoporosis, while cold mud-bath shows good effect on bone metabolism. The cold mud-baths help to reduce arthritic inflammation and pain and thereby lead to higher mobility with positive consequence on bone. ","275":"The risk of high-grade lesions and carcinoma is known to correlate with specific high-risk HPV genotypes. The distribution of HPV types varies between countries and little is known about HPV distribution in our country. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the range and frequency of HPV genotypes in studied group of women in Montenegro. HPV genotypes were determined using the method of enzyme restriction of PCR products amplified with group-specific primers MY09\/MY11 and restricted with seven different restriction endonucleases. Out of the total number of women HPV infection was found in 1\/5 of participants (20%). Genotyping performed in HPV DNA positive women shows that the HPV genotype 16 is dominant and present in more than 1\/3 of the participants (36.8%). The second most frequent HPV infection is with HPV genotype 58 and it is found in 10.5% of participants. HPV 31 and HPV 6 infections are present in 7.9% of women, while infections with other genotypes were demonstrated individually by 2.6%. Multiple HPV infection was demonstrated in 18.4% and they are dominant in younger women (aged 25 to 30 years).","276":"Few studies concerning the occurrence of cow's milk allergy with the use of double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge test in adolescents and adult patients suffering from atopic dermatitis exist. To evaluate the occurrence of cow's milk allergy in adolescents and adults suffering from atopic dermatitis. Altogether 179 persons suffering from atopic dermatitis were included in the study: 51 men and 128 women entered the study with the average age of 26.2 (s.d. 9.5 years). Complete dermatological and allergological examinations were performed. The positive results in specific IgE and in skin prick tests were recorded in 12% of patients. According to the open exposure tests and double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge tests these patients are only sensitized to cow's milk without clinical symptoms of allergy. Double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge test confirmed food allergy to cow milk only in one patient (worsening of atopic dermatitis), the oral allergy syndrome was observed in another one patient, occurrence of this allergy was altogether 1.1%. Cow's milk allergy rarely plays a role in the worsening of atopic dermatitis in adolescent and adult patients. ","277":"The aim of our study was to determine the effect of selected cytostatics on a human ovarian cancer cell line A2780 as a model system for ovarian cancer treatment. This cell line is considered cisplatin-sensitive. Panel of tested cytostatics included cisplatin, paclitaxel, carboplatin, gemcitabine, topotecan and etoposide. These cytostatics have a different mechanism of action. To evaluate cytotoxic potential of the tested compounds, the methods measuring various toxicological endpoints were employed including morphological studies, MTT assay, dynamic monitoring of cell proliferation with xCELLigence, cell cycle analysis, caspase 3 activity and expression of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and cell death. The A270 cell line showed different sensitivity towards the selected cytostatics, the highest cytotoxic effect was associated with paclitaxel and topotecan.","278":"Bisphosphonates (BP) are potent inhibitors of bone resorption used mainly in the treatment of metastatic bone disease and osteoporosis. By inhibiting bone resorption, they prevent complications as pathological fracture, pain, tumor-induced hypercalcemia. Even though patient's benefit of BP therapy is huge, various side effects may develop. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) is among the most serious ones. Oncologic patients receiving high doses of BP intravenously are at high risk of BRONJ development. BPs impair bone turnover leading to compromised bone healing which may result in the exposure of necrotic bone in the oral cavity frequently following tooth extraction or trauma of the oral mucosa. Frank bone exposure may be complicated by secondary infection leading to osteomyelitis development with various symptoms and radiological findings. In the management of BRONJ, conservative therapy aiming to reduce the symptoms plays the main role. In patients with extensive bone involvement resective surgery may lead to complete recovery, provided that the procedure is correctly indicated. Since the treatment of BRONJ is difficult, prevention is the main goal. Therefore in high risk patients dental preventive measures should be taken prior to bisphosphonate administration. This requires adequate communication between the prescribing physician, the patient and the dentist.","279":"Oncocytic Schneiderian papilloma (OSP) is one of the three morphologically distinct tumors that arise from Schneiderian membrane (the others include exophytic papilloma and inverted papilloma). OSP almost always occurs unilaterally in the paranasal sinuses, usually in the maxillary sinus, ethmoid cells or sphenoid sinus. We report a case of a 64-year-old woman with OSP arising from the left frontal sinus. In the report herein, we describe an OSP originating in the region of frontal sinus, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first documented example in English literature of OSP developing in this anatomical site.","280":"There are various complications of prosthetic valvular surgeries. Among them, leaflet perforation should be emphasized and brought to mind when there have been eccentric valvular regurgitation. In this report, we presented 2 cases of iatrogenic aortic and mitral valve leaflet perforation after prosthetic valve surgeries.","281":"The male-female ratio at birth (M\/F: male births divided by total births), which is anticipated to approximate 0.515, has been shown to exhibit latitude gradients and secular trends. Annual national data for male and female live births for the 15 countries that comprise the former Soviet Union were obtained from the World Health Organisation for the period 1980-2009 (115,167,569 total live births) and analysed with contingency tables. Spearman correlation was also carried out to compare percentage annual gross domestic product growth (GDP%--downloaded from the World Bank) and M\/F. In this context, GDP% is used as a measure for economic hardship or wellbeing within the populace. There have been overall highly significant secular increases in M\/F (p &lt; 0.0001) in the countries and regions investigated. M\/F is significantly lower in the three more northern regions (Russian Federation, Baltic States and Central Asia. M\/F 0.51324, 0.51335-0.51314) than the two more southern regions (Southern Caucasus and Eastern Europe. M\/F 0.51654, 0.51635-0.51672). There was a male excess of 113,818 live births.There was a significant positive correlation between GDP% and M\/F for Armenia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. There was a significant negative correlation in Estonia. Previous studies have shown that improving socioeconomic conditions increase M\/F, and the converse has also been demonstrated. This is a potential influence in this geographical area since this region has relatively recently emerged from communist rule and experienced an overall economic upturn, but is only partially supported using GDP%. Another factor may be the selective termination of female pregnancies. The latitude gradient parallels that of neighbouring Europe but no theory has been put forward to convincingly explain this finding to date. ","282":"The pilot study deals with the clinical results of the regenerative therapeutical method in intraosseous periodontal defects done by surgical augmentation procedure using a material of a new generation prepared on the basis of a bioactive glass. A group of 10 individuals were treated properly for chronic periodontitis. Some of treated infraalveolar periodontal lesions, both periodontal pockets and interradicular defects, persisted or recurred in posterior teeth. In order to eliminate them they were indicated for advanced periodontal surgery or regenerative surgical therapy stimulating healing processes of supportive tissues, mostly alveolar bone around treated teeth. Relevant clinical parameters, i. e. values of the pocket depth, gingival recession, and loss of attachment were evaluated before and after the periodontal surgery and compared with each other. The therapy led to significant improvement of clinical parameters in terms of the reduction of pocket depth and loss of attachment values.","283":"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal problems among Czech dentists and to analyze the factors that affect these disorders. Information was gathered through questionnaire completed by 581 physicians. The questionnaire ascertained general information about physicians including their work habits and the characteristics of their work environment along with the occurrence of musculoskeletal problems as well as their intensity. In the past year the occurrence of at least mild difficulties associated with the locomotive system was reported by 96.9% of dentists surveyed (n = 557), with 66.3% of respondents (n = 381) reporting difficulties ofa moderate or major nature. Most respondents of both sexes indicated neck pain. A statistically significant correlation with the occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints of medium and major intensity was demonstrated for the following factors: sex, age, running a private practice, past injury or musculoskeletal diseases, and the perception of work as psychologically demanding. Musculoskeletal disorders in dentists in Czech Republic are relatively frequent and serious health problem. The causes of these diseases must be identified and appropriate preventive interventions undertaken that will contribute to a reduction in the incidence of these problems.","284":"Authors studied potential side effects of fetal calf serum (FCS) in cultivation media on human dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) during long-term cultivation. Two lines of DPSC obtained healthy donors (male 22 years, female 23 years) were used. Both lines were cultivated under standard cultivation conditions in four different media containing 10% or 2% FCS and substituted with growth factors. During long-term cultivation proliferation ability, karyotype and phenotype of DPSC were measured. Both lines of DPSC cultivated in a media containing 2% FCS and ITS supplement showed the highest number of population doublings. On the other hand the proliferation rate of DPSC cultivated in a media with 2% FCS without ITS supplement was slowest. Proliferation rate of DPSC cultivated in 10% FCS media with or without FGF-2 was comparable. DPSC cultivated in a media with 10% FCS showed a significantly higher amount of chromosomal aberrations. These chromosomal aberrations do not seem to be clonal but surprisingly we found large amounts of tetraploid cells in the 9th passage in both media containing 10% FCS. Our study proved that cultivation of DPSC in media containing higher concentration of FCS has critical side effects on cell chromosomal stability. ","285":"Angiofibromas are rare vascular tumors which originate predominantly in the nasopharynx and occur typically in male adolescents. Extranasopharyngeal sites such as nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are less frequent. This review article was undertaken to evaluate the incidence, clinical features and management of extranasopharyngeal angiofibromas originating exclusivelly from nasal cavity structures. Our focus of interest was to evaluate the significance of immunohistochemical analysis in diagnosis of such extremely rare neoplasms. In the PubMed and Google Search, we found only 39 cases of nasal angifibroma, 27 males and 12 females from 1980 to 2012. The most prevalent site of origin was nasal septum, followed by inferior and middle turbinate. The commonest symptoms were nasal obstruction and epistaxis. Nasal angiofibromas are clinically distinct from nasopharyneal angiofibromas and can therefore be misdiagnosed. The differential diagnosis includes other vascular lesions, such as lobular capillary hemangioma and sinonasal-type hemangiopericytoma. Although immunohistochemistry is not necessary for differentiation between angiofibroma and capillary hemangioma, that diagnostic procedure may be helpful in distinction from sinonasal hemangiopericytoma. As an ilustration for immunohistochemical analysis, we presented a case of an elderly woman with tumor arising from the middle turbinate, diagnosed as angiofibroma. The staining was positive for CD34, CD31, factor VIII, vimentin and smooth muscle alpha-actin, and negative for desmin.","286":"Congenital malformations such as lumbosacral transitional vertebrae and spina bifida occulta constitute unrare anomalies and could affect the symptomatology of low back pain. A transitional vertebra is characterized by elongation of one or both transverse processes, leading to the appearance ofa sacralized fifth lumbar vertebra or a lumbarized first sacral vertebra. Furthermore, sacral spina bifida occulta is a developmental anomaly that corresponds to the incomplete closure of the vertebral column. In the present case report, we describe a case of a dried sacrum presenting a partially sacralized fifth lumbar vertebra and total spina bifida, extended from first to fifth sacral vertebra. A pseudoarthrosis is formed on the left side and the specimen could be incorporated in Castellvi's type IIa. Moreover, the incidence, morphology, clinical and surgical significance of these spinal malformations are discussed.","287":"Myopericytoma is a rare benign tumour composed of pericytic cells that show myoid differentiation and have a tendency for concentric perivascular growth. It belongs to a spectrum ofperivascular myoid cell neoplasms. To date, only a small number of cases of myopericytoma involving the oral cavity have been reported. We describe a case of myopericytoma presenting as a slowly growing tongue nodule in a 61-year-old woman. A diagnosis of myopericytoma was established with the histopathological findings combined with immunohistochemical staining. Myopericytoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of well-circumscribed, slow-growing lesions of the oral cavity.","288":"This cross sectional study focused on how Postural Stability (PS) indicators: body sway deviation (BSD) and body sway velocity (BSV), change with age and their association with levels of social and physical activity. Observational study: 80 older adults (aged: 60-96) were purposefully recruited from two sources: the University of the Third Age (TAU) (n = 35) and a residential care home (CH) (n = 45). Differences in the indicators of PS, approximated through Centre of Pressure (COP) measurements, were assessed by the Romberg Stance Test (Test A) subsequently repeated on 10 cm foam surface (Test B), using a Kistler Dynamometric Platform. The RCH Group was older, had higher BMI and was less socially and physically active, showed more body sway in all indicators compared to TAU group. For all participants body sway velocity (BSV) was significantly correlated with age. The strength of correlation of body sway deviation (BSD) with age was also significant but not as strong. The findings indicate in line with previous studies that deterioration in BSV is associated with poor PS more than deterioration in BSD.","289":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of total hip arthroplasty in patients with Parkinson's disease during a period of five years, focusing on the assessment of the risks and benefits of surgery. During this period we performed total hip arthroplasty in 14 patients (15 hips) with Parkinson's disease. Patients were evaluated by subjective symptoms and objective findings, with a focus on the use of support while walking and walking distance, severity of Parkinson's disease before surgery and at the time of the last follow-up. During the postoperative period, the following parameters were assessed: length of ICU stay, mobilization, complications, the total duration of hospitalization and follow-up care after discharge. Of the 11 patients (12 hips) followed-up 1-5 years with an average of 3 years after operation 8 cases showed progression of neurological disability. 5 patients (6 hips) showed an increased dependence on the use of support when walking and reduced distance that the patient was able to walk. Subjectively, 10 hip joints were completely painless and 2 patients complained of only occasional mild pain in the operated hip. Complications that were encountered were urinary tract infection (5 patients), cognitive impairment (3 patients) and pressure ulcer (2 patients). We did not observe any infection or dislocation of the prosthesis. Three patients fell and fractured the femur and 3 patients in our cohort died during follow up. Implantation of total replacement is possible with judicious indication after careful evaluation of neurological finding in patients with minimal or mild functional impairment of the locomotor system. Prerequisite for a good result is precise surgical technique and optimal implant position with balanced tension of the muscles and other soft tissues around the hip.","290":"In view of the high anti-oxidative potential oftocotrienol, the role of the tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) of palm oil in preventing pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) was explored in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in an urban teaching hospital. Healthy primigravidae were randomized to receive either oral TRF 100 mg daily or placebo, from early second trimester until delivery. Out of 299 women, 151 were randomized into the TRF arm and 148 into the placebo arm. A total of 15 (5.0%) developed PIH. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of PIH (4\/151 or 2.6% in the TRF arm vs. 11\/148 or 7.4% in the placebo arm, p = 0.058) between the two arms, there was a tendency towards a lower incidence of PIH in the TRF arm compared to the placebo arm. With TRF supplementation, the relative risk (RR) of PIH was 0.36 (95% CI 0.12-1.09). In conclusion, although TRF from palm oil does not statistically significantly reduce the risk of development of PIH in the population studied, the 64% reduction in incidence of PIH is substantial. The findings warrant further clinical trials, particularly in high risk populations.","291":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro sealing ability of three repair materials. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA; Group A), calcium phosphate cement (CPC; Group B), and light cured glass ionomer cement (GIC; Group C) when used to repair the perforation created in the pulpal floor of fifty extracted human permanent molars. Preparation of access openings and furcation perforations were done, and the teeth divided into five experimental groups (A, B, C) including two controls (D, E) with ten samples in each group randomly. Following the repair procedure, the pulp chambers and access openings were filled with composite resin and immersed in 2% methylene blue solution for 48 hours. The teeth were sectioned longitudinally and the linear dye penetration measured under a stereomicroscope. The comparison of the linear length of micro-leakage (mm) among the experimental groups revealed no significant difference (p = 0.332). On calculating the percentage of depth of leakage to the total length of the perforation, it was observed that the mean leakage was 35.5% in Group A, 53.6% in Group B and the highest, 87.5% in Group C. The mean of leakage percentage was statistically significant by Kruskal-Wallis test (p = 0.003). The results indicated that the dye penetration used as furcation perforation repair material was least with mineral trioxide aggregate. Comparing the depth of penetration of dye, 50% of the Group A samples showed less than 25% of depth penetration. While 40% of Group B cases had more than 50% dye penetration. In our study, all Group C teeth had &gt; or = 50% dye penetration. The present study indicated that GIC had the greatest dye penetration followed by CPC and MTA. Mineral trioxide aggregate and calcium phosphate cement had comparatively better sealing ability than glass ionomer cement. ","292":"Diagnosis of nerve agent intoxication is based on anamnestic data, clinical signs and laboratory examination. For acute poisoning, cholinesterase activity in the blood (erythrocyte AChE, plasma\/serum BuChE) is sensitive, simple and most frequent laboratory examination performed in biochemical laboratories. Specialized examinations to precise treatment (reactivation test) or to make retrospective diagnosis (fluoride induced reactivation etc.) can be conducted. Other sophisticated methods are available, too.","293":"We report the case of a 22-year old male, a self-confessed recreational drug user who developed cardiogenic shock because of severe destruction of the aortic valve by rapidly progressive aortic valve endocarditis. The disease progression was acute; in a matter of days, the clinical manifestations were life-threatening necessitating urgent aortic valve replacement surgery. Cultivation revealed Streptococcus viridans as the microbial agent. Subsequent recovery with antibiotic treatment was without complication. This case report shows that immediately performed transoesophageal echocardiography and early consultation with a cardiac surgeon has fundamental importance in diagnosis and management of acute infective endocarditis in haemodynamically instable patients.","294":"We present a 73 year old female with intractable pruritus and nonspecific cutaneous rash for a period of 9 months. She had recieved symptomatic therapy with no improvement. A complete examination revealed axillary and abdominal lymphadenopathy. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Hodgkins lymphoma with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. She received 5 cycles of chemotherapy with resolution of pruritus and reduction in axillary and abdominal lymphadenopathy. The patient presented 6 months later with relapse and succumbed to the illness. Simultaneous occurrence of Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Hodgkins lymphoma may lead to misdiagnosis. The awareness of such an association is important to make an accurate diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy.","295":"Sometimes intraorbital foreign bodies lead to unexpected findings. A 16-year old boy was referred due to ocular surface trauma. A conjunctival laceration was detected at the level of the left caruncle with associated left exotropia, reduced adduction as well as a preretinal hemorrhage along the nasal periphery of the fundus. A blow-out fracture of the medial orbital wall was suspected and a CT scan of the orbits was scheduled which revealed the presence of a large intraorbital foreign body. The removal of the intraorbital foreign body (which proved to be a bullet) and precautionary laser photocoagulation along the nasal periphery of the left eye were performed. Ocular surface trauma may reveal unexpected findings, such as an intraorbital foreign body, requiring investigation by a CT scan.","296":"Here we report the case of a 31-year-old man admitted to our hospital with echocardiografic and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance signs of myocarditis complicated by ventricular tachycardia, initially resolved with direct current shock. After the recurrence of ventricular tachycardia the patient was submitted to electrophysiological study revealing a re-entrant circuit at the level of the medium segment of interventricular septum, successfully treated with transcatheter ablation. This case highlights how the presence of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias at the onset of acute myocarditis, suspected or proven, could be associated with a pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrate, therefore these patients should be submitted to electrophysiological study in order to rule out the presence of arrhythmogenic focuses that can be treated with transcatheter ablation.","297":"Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a specialized subpopulation of T cells that act to suppress inadequate immune response. Psoriasis is recognized as a T-cell driven immune-mediated systemic inflammatory disease with skin manifestation. Effective therapeutical approach to treat psoriasis is Goeckerman therapy (GT). The aim of this study was to compare the number of Treg in the peripheral blood of 27 psoriatic patients and 19 controls and to evaluate the influence of GT on Treg population in peripheral blood of patients with psoriasis. There was no significant difference in the relative number of Treg cells in the peripheral blood of healthy blood donors and patients with psoriasis before initiation of GT (P = 0.2668). In contrary, the relative number of Treg cells in peripheral blood of patients with psoriasis after GT was significantly higher than those found in healthy blood donors (P = 0.0019). Moreover, the relative number of Treg is significantly increased in psoriatic patients after Goeckerman therapy compared to the pre-treatment level (P = 0.0042). In conclusion, this significant increase in Treg count after GT is probably associated with amelioration of inflammation by GT, as disease activity expressed as PASI decreased in our patients by GT (P = 0.0001).","298":"The principal aim was to establish reference paediatric data for the serum homocysteine levels in Czech children and adolescents. 144 children either healthy or not sufferig from acute or chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders including rheumatic diseases, inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, epilepsy, chronic renal failure, aged 0-19.9 years (0-6.9 years, n = 40; 7-10.9 y, n = 28; 11-15.9 y, n = 45; 16-19.9 y, n = 31) had their blood samples collected and the serum homocysteine level (S-homocysteine) was evaluated by chemiluminescence. A significant age dependence of the S-homocysteine levels was observed (R = 0.35, p &lt; 0.01); with highest values of upper reference range in the 11-15.9 and 16-19.9 years' group, respectively. The establishment of S-homocysteine reference Czech pediatric values is a potentially useful tool for proper evaluation of elevated homocysteine levels and corresponding risks in childhood. ","299":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause ofnontraumatic neurological disability in Europe and North America. Growth factor expression could participate in the repair process of the demyelinating disease. Among growth factors, brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) has been demonstrated to play an important role in neuronal and axonal survival. In the central nervous system (CNS), neurons are the main source of BDNF. Another potential source are activated astrocytes, which are present in inflamed areas in the CNS as shown in MS. In this study, total protein concentration (TPC) and BDNF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the patients with MS (n = 48) and control subjects (n = 53) were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No significant change in the CSF TPC of patients with MS was seen as compared to normal CSF. The presence of BDNF in the CSF samples was shown by Western blot. Using ELISA, it was shown that the level of BDNF in the MS CSF is higher than in normal CSF. It is concluded that BDNF is a constant component of human CSF. Moreover, it could be implicated in the pathophysiology of MS.","300":"The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during childhood is low with two peaks - neonatal and adolescent age. This retrospective study is focused on clinical characteristics ofVTE during adolescence. The main goals are to assess the most frequent inherited and acquired risk factors and to evaluate the benefit of D-dimers in diagnostics of venous thromboemblism. The data of 18 adolescents were analysed--16 girls (88.9%), 2 boys (11.1%). In 9 patients (50%) thrombosis of the lower limb deep veins was diagnosed, six patients (33.3%) suffered from symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) and 3 patients (16.7%) from thrombosis at unusual sites. One patient had an idiopathic VTE, the mean number of the inherited and acquired risk factors was 2.6. The most frequent inherited risk factor was Leiden mutation of factor V (27.8%). The most frequent acquired risk factor was oral contraception (OC) in 12 out of 16 girls (75%). All of our patients on oral contraception had one or more additional risk factors. 10 out of 18 (55.6%) patients with VTE had elevated activity of factor VIII. The sensitivity of D-dimers was low (50%) in patients with distal lower limb thrombosis, but very high (100%) in patients with PE.","301":"To evaluate the clinical usefulness of serum levels of soluble form of endoglin in stage III colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) patients for detection of recurrence. The case-control study consisted of 80 stage III CRC patients who underwent surgery with curative intent and 70 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Serum levels of soluble form of endoglin (sol-end) were measured in both groups. Also, predictive factors of recurrence were evaluated using multivariate analyses. Serum levels of sol-end in stage III CRC patients were significantly higher than those in controls. There was not a significant association between serum levels of sol-end and clinicopathological features in CRC patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed the LNR (hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.46-4.34; p &lt; 0.001), to be significant independent factors to estimate local recurrence in stage III CRC patients. Preoperative serum levels of sol-end do not seem useful as a marker for detection of recurrence in stage III CRC patients. ","302":"In this paper we describe the influence of NU7026, a specific inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and ATM-kinase on molecular and cellular mechanisms triggered by ionising irradiation in human T-lymphocyte leukaemic MOLT-4 cells. We studied the effect of this inhibitor (10 1microM) combined with gamma-radiation (1 Gy) leading to DNA damage response and induction of apoptosis. We used methods for apoptosis assessment (cell viability count and flow-cytometric analysis) and cell cycle analysis (DNA content measurement) and we detected expression and post-translational modifications (Western blotting) of proteins involved in DNA repair signalling pathways. Pre-treatment with NU7026 resulted into decreased activation of checkpoint kinase-2 (Thr68), p53 (Ser15 and Ser392), and histone H2A.X (Ser139) 2 hours after irradiation. Subsequently, combination of radiation and inhibitor led to decreased amount of cells in G2-phase arrest and into increased apoptosis after 72 hours. Our results indicate that in leukaemic cells the pre-incubation with inhibitor NU7026 followed by low doses of ionising radiation results in radio-sensitising of MOLT-4 cells via diminished DNA repair and delayed but pronounced apoptosis. This novel approach might offer new strategies in combined treatment of leukaemia diseases.","303":"CD200 and its receptor were recognized as having the multiple immunoregulatory functions. Their immunoregulatory, suppressive, and tolerogenic potentials could be very effectively exploited in the treatment of many diseases, e.g. Alzheimer disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergy to name only some. Many research projects are aimed to develop clinically valuable methods being based on the structure and function of these paired molecules. In this review, we would like to introduce CD200\/CD200R functions in a clinical context.","304":"Angiosarcoma is a soft tissue tumour with a dismal prognosis. We present a 74 year old male presenting with a non healing ulcer on the scalp. On histopathology a diagnosis of angiosarcoma was made. An early diagnosis and tumour size play a pivotal role in the survival of the patient.","305":"An eight-month-old male child was admitted with weakness and swelling in the feet. Paraparesis and bilateral lower extremity edema were present in the neurological examination. Thoracic MRI showed an intradural intramedullary mass 61 x 11 mm in size in the T5-T10 levels. Laminotomy between the T5-T10 vertebrae was performed. A mass with smooth borders was separated from most of the neural tissue. In the postoperative MRI, we observed a contrast enhancing area, considered a residual fragment, only 5 x 4 mm in size. Histopathological properties were compatible with the intermixed subtype of ganglioneuroblastoma. Only a limited number of thoracic cord Ganglioneuroblastoma reports have been previously published. Although very rare in children and young adults, ganglioneuroblastoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of thoracic cord tumors. It is difficult to obtain a preoperative diagnosis with clinical features and radiological investigations. Diagnosis depends on histopathological examinations. Curative treatment should be in the form of a complete resection of the tumor. In partially resected cases, adjuvant radiotherapy may become necessary, along with close follow-up.","306":"Acenocoumarol is a vitamin K antagonist that is used for the treatment of acquired and congenital, both arterial and venous, thrombotic diseases. Its use is complicated by the narrow therapeutic range. Bleeding following oral anticoagulation, despite rare, remains the major complication. Most cases of hemorrhagic episodes usually require short hospitalization and transfusion, while surgical drainage of the hematoma is not recommended. However, in cases that conservative treatment isn't successful, surgical intervention remains an option. We present a case of severe spontaneous bleeding of the rectus abdominis muscle which was successfully managed surgically.","307":"","308":"Adolescent hallux valgus (HV) is a progressive deformity of adolescent age consisting of metatarsus primus varus and hallux valgus. It has a high recurrence rate after conventional surgical correction. Ten feet in nine patients (two males, seven females) were treated surgically with the Peterson Newman bunion procedure, with a minimum follow-up of one year. During the final follow-up all these patients had no complaints of pain, joint stiffness or limping. Even though the patients had some mild loss of range of movements at the MTPjoints 4-6 degrees compared to preoperative value, it did not cause any functional impairment and all were satisfied with the final outcome. The double ostetomy for treatment ofhallux valgus is technically precise procedure, provides excellent correction and stability and has low rate of recurrence of deformity. We had an excellent outcome in 10 feet in our study without residual deformity or complications.","309":"Seminal vesicle secretion is important for increasing the stability of sperm chromatin, inhibition of the immune activity in the female reproductive tract and so on. Metronidazole (MTZ), a drug used for treatment of infections caused by anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, may have negative effects on the genital gland including the seminal vesicles. Curcumin exhibits antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aims to evaluate the negative effects of MTZ on the seminal vesicle structure and ameliorative effects of curcumin using stereological methods. Thirty balb\/c mice were divided into six groups. The control group was received distilled water. The second and the third received higher doses of MTZ (500 mg\/kg body weight\/day) and MTZ (500 mg\/kg\/day) + 100 mg\/kg\/day curcumin, respectively. The fourth and the fifth were treated with lower doses of MTZ (165 mg\/kg body weight\/day) and MTZ (165 mg\/kg body weight\/day) + curcumin (100 mg\/kg body weight\/day), respectively. The sixth group received 100 mg\/kg body weight\/day curcumin. All the administrations were done by oral gavages for 14 days. After 30 days, seminal vesicles were removed. Stereological study of the seminal vesicle structure revealed a significant reduction in gland and vesicular fluid volume in MTZ-treated (higher or lower doses) animals. Curcumin protected the reduction of both parameters in therapeutic-dose treated animals. Metronidazole treatment does not induce structural changes in the seminal gland; however, it can have a significant impact on its secretion ability. Importantly, these deteriorations might be preventable by curcumin co-treatment.","310":"The reactivating and therapeutic efficacy of two combinations ofoximes (HI-6 + trimedoxime and HI-6 + K203) was compared with the effectiveness of antidotal treatment involving single oxime (HI-6, trimedoxime, K203) using in vivo methods. In vivo determined percentage of reactivation of cyclosarin-inhibited blood and tissue acetylcholinesterase in poisoned rats showed that the reactivating efficacy of both combinations of oximes is slightly higher than the reactivating efficacy of the most effective individual oxime in blood, diaphragm as well as in brain. Moreover, both combinations of oximes were found to be slightly more efficacious in the reduction of acute lethal toxic effects in cyclosarin-poisoned mice than the antidotal treatment involving single oxime. Based on the obtained data, we can conclude that the antidotal treatment involving chosen combinations of oximes brings a beneficial effect for its ability to counteract the acute poisoning with cyclosarin.","311":"Oral Lichen planus (OLP) is chronic inflammatory oral mucosal disease of unknown etiology. Basement membrane damage and T-cell migration in OLP may be mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). We examined the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 to support this hypothesis. The study population consisted of 71 patients with OLP and 10 control patients with oral fibromas. Indirect immunohistochemistry was used for detection of MMP 9 expression (polyclonal rabbit anti-human MMP antibody). In all cases of OLP, the MMP-9 expression was seen mainly in the area oflymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria including lymphocytes within the overlying epithelium. In addition, it was observed in the epithelial keratinocytes, particularly in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum with occasional positivity in the superficial layer. Fibroblasts and endothelium of small vessels in the lamina propria showed MMP9 expression as well. In all cases of oral mucosal fibromas, the MMP-9 expression was seen only in fibroblasts and in endothelium of small vessels with occasional positivity within the overlying epithelium. It remains unclear, whether MMP-9 is directly connected to OLP pathogenesis. ","312":"The aim of the study was to establish the frequency of hypovitaminosis D in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), its influence on biochemical and densitometric parameters and the relation to diabetic nephropathy. 58 children with T1D at the age 9-19 years were enrolled to the study. Vitamin D concentration less than 30 ng\/ml was considered as insufficient. 37 children (63.79%) had vitamin D level under 30 ng\/ml, from these 19 subjects (32.7%) had vitamin D level under 20 ng\/ml and 2 subjects (3.44%) under 10 ng\/ml. Children with vitamin D deficiency had significantly lower magnesium concentration and lower Z score of lumbar spine (-1.34 +\/- 1.24 vs. -.030 +\/- 1.21, p = 0.01) compared to diabetics with sufficient vitamin D concentration. No significant difference was found in parameters calcium, phosphorus or glycosylated hemoglobin. Patients with diabetic nephropathy (n = 18) showed no significant difference in vitamin D, glycosylated hemoglobin or Z score of lumbar spine compared to the patients without nephropathy (n = 40). Subjects with nephropathy had significantly longer diabetes duration, significantly higher cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentration. In our cohort of patients nearly two thirds of children had insufficient vitamin D concentration what supports the need to monitor and eventually supplement vitamin D in T1D subjects.","313":"CD200\/CD200R are highly conserved type I paired membrane glycoproteins that belong to the Ig superfamily containing a two immunoglobulin-like domain (V, C). CD200 is broadly distributed in a variety of cell types, whereas CD200R is primarily expressed in myeloid and lymphoid cells. They fulfill multiple functions in regulating inflammation. The interaction between CD200\/CD200R results in activation of the intracellular inhibitory pathway with RasGAP recruitment and thus contributes to effector cell inhibition. It was confirmed that the CD200R activation stimulates the differentiation ofT cells to the Treg subset, upregulates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, modulates cytokine environment from a Thl to a Th2 pattern, and facilitates an antiinflammatory IL-10 and TGF-beta synthesis. CD200\/CD200R are required for maintaining self-tolerance. Many studies have demonstrated the importance of CD200 in controlling autoimmunity, inflammation, the development and spread of cancer, hypersensitivity, and spontaneous fetal loss.","314":"Despite the fact that the genetic basis of schizophrenia has been intensively studied for more than two decades, our contemporary knowledge in this field is rather fractional, and a substantial part of it is still missing. The aim of this review article is to sum up the data coming from genome-wide association genetic studies in schizophrenia, and indicate prospective directions of further scientific endeavour. We searched the National Human Genome Research Institute's Catalog of genome-wide association studies for schizophrenia to identify all papers related to this topic. In consequence, we looked up the possible relevancy of these findings for etiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia using the computer gene and PubMed databases. Eighteen genome-wide association studies in schizophrenia have been published till now, referring to fifty-seven genes supposedly involved into schizophrenia's etiopathogenesis. Most of these genes are related to neurodevelopment, neuroendocrinology, and immunology. It is reasonable to predict that complex studies of sufficiently large samples, involving detection of copy number variants and assessment of endophenotypes, will produce definitive discoveries of genetic risk factors for schizophrenia in the future. ","315":"Spontaneous rupture is a rare and dramatic complication ofhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), burdened by a high mortality. Here we describe a case of a 73-year-old man, who arrived at the ER because of syncope, and acute epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. He had a history of hepatitis C-related liver cirrhosis and HCC in treatment with sorafenib. The physical examination showed a state of hemorrhagic anemia with the presence of blood in the peritoneal cavity. The patient underwent an urgent liver resection. Thirty days after surgery, he was in good general condition. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor recently introduced in the therapy of patients with advanced HCC. Among the various side effects reported in patients treated with sorafenib, there is a higher risk of bleeding. In conclusion, sorafenib may increase the risk of bleeding and rupture of HCC in susceptible individuals.","316":"Aspergillus sp. are ubiquitous mould infections and in most patients, the source is presumed to be air-borne infections during surgical procedures. Prevention of these infections requires special attention of ventilation systems in operating rooms. Post-operative aspergillosis occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients as well as those who receive corticosteroids temporarily. We report a case of a 71-year-old immunocompromised patient who developed multiple lower limb embolisms due to Aspergillus niger originating from an aortitis of the ascending aorta nine months following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.","317":"Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and painful spasms. Misdiagnosis may occur due to the fact that the clinical picture of SPS is often atypical. The main pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the development of SPS is insufficient inhibition at the cortical and spinal levels. There is good evidence for a primary autoimmune etiology. A 61-year-old man was admitted to a neurological department due to muscle hypertonia with episodic attacks of painful spasms predominantly affecting axial muscles. The symptoms developed shortly after tickborne meningoencephalitis. Electromyography (EMG) revealed signs of continuous motor unit activity. Antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (anti-GAD) were highly elevated. We present a case of a man who developed clinically severe anti-GAD positive SPS, provoked by tick-borne encephalitis. After therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) a rapid, temporary improvement of the clinical and neurophysiological findings was noted. Only after being placed on long-term immunosuppression did the patient achieve stable recovery. This case supports the importance of EMG findings and demonstrates the effect of TPE as well as the need for chronic immunosuppression in severe cases of SPS.","318":"The authors present the case of a young woman with newly diagnosed Takayasu's arteritis. This woman, with arterial hypertension, was investigated for the unspecific symptoms at the beginning. Afterwards, the transthoracic echocardiography showed dysfunction of the left ventricle and the abdominal sonography showed a stenosis of the right renal artery. PET\/CT scan showed chronic modification after inflammatory processes on the wall of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. This case report should be instructive to other clinicians and refers to the necessity to remember this rare disease in our country too.","319":"","320":"Few studies concerning the importance of wheat allergy affecting the course ofatopic eczema in adolescents and adult patients exist. The evaluation if wheat allergy can deteriorate the course of atopic eczema. Follow-up of patients with confirmed food allergy to wheat. Altogether 179 persons suffering from atopic eczema were included in the study: 51 men and 128 women entered the study with an average age of 26.2 (s.d. 9.5 years) Dermatological and allergological examinations were performed, including skin prick tests, atopy patch tests, and specific serum IgE for wheat, open exposure test and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge test with wheat flour. Wheat allergy affecting the coures of atopic eczema was confirmed in eight patients (4.5%) out of 179 patients enrolled in this study by double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge test. The course of atopic eczema showed a positive trend in patients with confirmed food allergy at 3, 6, 9, 12 month follow-up (statistical evaluation with paired t-test) after the elimination of wheat flour. Wheat allergy may play an important role in the worsening of atopic eczema (acting as a triggering exacerbating factor) only in a minority of adolescents and adult patients (4.5% in our study). The diagnostic methods (skin prick test, specific IgE, atopy patch test, history) cannot be used as separated tests for the determination of food allergy to wheat in patients with atopic eczema.Open exposure tests and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge should be used for the confirmation of wheat allergy affecting the course of atopic eczema. ","321":"The authors demonstrate the possibility of improving surgical results by the reduction of perioperative bleeding in thoracic surgery associated with extended resection procedures. We focused on patients in whom the expected perioperative blood loss was greater than 500 ml. The first group consisted of patients with lung cancer stage III A after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had been indicated to extend the resection procedure. The second group consisted of patients with chest wall and mediastinum tumors of various etiologies. The third group consisted of patients with post-inflammatory thoracic complications in whom combined decortication and pleurectomy was necessary. By the using the local hemostyptic Traumastem TAF on the basis of oxidized cellulose, it is possible to minimize the perioperative blood loss, thus sparing the blood derivative requirement and enabling surgeons to provide the desired treatment even to high-risk patients.","322":"This study aimed to evaluate prostate volume changes and prostate motions during radiotherapy. In 2010, twenty-five patients were treated for prostate cancer by external beam radiotherapy with implanted fiducial markers. Coordinates of three gold markers on kilovoltage images were calculated daily. Volume changes in target structure were observed through changes in intermarker distances. Differences in patient position between laser-tattoo alignment and gold marker localization were evaluated. Intrafraction motion was assessed by measuring marker displacement on kilovoltage images acquired before and after fraction delivery. Prostate shrinkage was observed in 60% of patients. The average shrinkage was 7% of the prostate's initial volume. Corrections after laser-tattoo alignment remained mostly below 1 cm. The difference between marker centroid position on the actual images and the planning images was 2 +\/- 1 mm on average. The extension of intrafraction movements was 7.6 +\/- 0.2 mm on average. In our retrospective study, the possibility for prostate volume changes during radiotherapy was revealed. Intrafraction movements turned out to be the limiting factor in safety margin reduction. ","323":"Rubber dam is considered an ideal device for tooth isolation. Nevertheless, its usage is quite rare in the Czech Republic. The aim of this study was: firstly, to gather and evaluate information regarding the use of rubber dam by dentists in the Czech Republic and to compare it with other countries; secondly to find out whether there are any influencing factors as to rubber dam usage; and finally to find out frequency of rubber dam use separately in endodontic treatment and in placing fillings of different materials. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted. Dentists filled in the questionnaires during dental conventions, educational events, conferences and congresses. Rubber dam was routinely used by less than eight per cent of the respondents (n = 35); less than twenty-two per cent of the respondents (n = 97) used rubber dam occasionally, and more than seventy per cent of the respondents (n = 317) has never use it. The results showed that rubber dam is not used frequently in the Czech Republic. If rubber dam is used, then it is typically for endodontic treatment or composite fillings. There were several factors with a statistically significant influence on the usage of rubber dam, such as gender, length of professional career, percentage of direct payments, previous experience in using rubber dam, and undergraduate training in rubber dam use.","324":"Bio-degradable stents are be made of different synthetic polymers (like polylactide or polyglycolide) or their co-polymers (polydioxanone). They can be used for treating benign stenoses of the small and large intestine, particularly in Crohn's disease. Endoscopic introduction of bio-degradable stents into small and large intestinal stenoses is feasible and relatively simple. Initial results are encouraging and the complication rate is low. However, there are still some difficulties that need to be overcome. The rate of early stent migration is still rather high (up to one third of patients). This might be solved by changes in the shape or rigidity of the stents as well as by further improvement in the design. Proof of long-term efficacy and safety requires further studies.","325":"Variant branching pattern of the cords of brachial plexus coupled with erroneous communications has been an area of concern for surgeons opting to explore this region. Anaesthetic blocks and surgical approaches are the highlights of these interventions, where a keen familiarization of the anatomy of this region is mandatory. The present case description reports a unilateral variant branching pattern of the posterior cord coexistent with a neural communication between lateral and medial cords in an adult male cadaver. This intercordal neural communication between lateral and medial cords was oriented obliquely and measured 2.2 cm in length. Furthermore, the posterior cord revealed a variant branching pattern. It branched into three upper subscapular nerves and a common trunk for the thoracodorsal and lower subscapular nerves. The lowest of the three upper subscapular nerves gave a communicating twig to the thoracodorsal nerve. Inspite of uncountable reports on variations ofbrachial plexus, descriptions regarding anomalous branching patterns hold enormous clinical significance for the radiologists, anesthetists and surgeons, besides being of academic interest for the anatomists.","326":"Only a few cases of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in Cushing's syndrome have been published in the literature so far. In the majority of these patients, the pneumonia occurred after reduction of the hypercortisolism with medicamentous treatment. We report two cases of PCP during conservative treatment of hypercortisolism. We describe clinical, imaging and laboratory findings in two patients and review published cases of pneumocystits pneumonia in Cushing's syndrome. A 60-year-old woman and 20-year-old man with Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH syndrome were treated at our department. Both developed pneumocystis pneumonia early after treatment with ketoconazole and ethomidate bromide had been introduced and the levels of cortisol rapidly decreased. PCP prophylaxis in patients with high cortisolemia should be started before treatment of hypercortisolism in current practice. Gradual lowering of plasma cortisol should also reduce the risk of infection by Pneumocystis jiroveci.","327":"Ruptured pregnancy in the rudimentary horn of women who have had a vaginal delivery is rare and unpredictable. However, when undiagnosed, this condition could lead to maternal morbidity and mortality. We report a pregnancy at 19 weeks gestation presented with acute abdomen and hypovolemic shock. She was initially thought to have an intrauterine pregnancy with the provisional diagnosis of a ruptured uterus. Intraoperatively, a ruptured non-communicating right rudimentary horn with ex utero pregnancy was discovered.","328":"Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma (CCOC) is a rare odontogenic tumor associated with aggressive clinical behavior, metastasis and low survival. We report a case of CCOC affecting the maxilla of 62 year-old woman. It was first described as a clinicopathological entity in 1985 and to date only 67 cases were described in the English literature. We are understanding of the behavior of this carcinomas was depend on limited case reports. For these reason we found important to report this case of CCOC in the maxilla.","329":"The aim of this prospective study was to find the association between the factor V Leiden mutation and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study is an analysis of a prospective observational study of the frequency of placenta-mediated complications of factor V Leiden mutation carriers. We compared pregnancy outcomes of 11 women with a heterozygous form of the factor V Leiden mutation with 41 women of a control group. All pregnancies ended with delivery of a living infant. None of the 52 pregnancies were complicated by venous thromboembolism. There were a few significant differences regarding placenta-mediated complications. The gestational age at delivery showed small significant differences. There was a significant difference in the birth weight deviation in percentage between FVL carriers and controls. The incidence of blood loss exceeding 1000 ml was higher in the control group. Carriership of the factor V Leiden mutation did not affect the incidence of preeclampsia. Adverse pregnancy outcomes such as placental abruption were rare. Eclampsia, intrauterine fetal death and venous thromboembolism did not occur. Our results provide evidence that the maternal heterozygous FVL mutation did not increase the risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome. ","330":"Clinical oncologists have been focusing their efforts on attempting to define risk groups of patients with unusual biological reactions to the recommended therapy regimens using molecular biology techniques. (i) to find a design and validate a method for fast and reliable analysis of the D1853N (5557G&gt;A) genetic polymorphism in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) gene; (ii) to use side-directed mutagenesis to generate ATM 5557A-positive DNA (reference ATM5557A DNA); and (iii) to analyze a group of patients suffering from cervical carcinoma with adverse responses to radiotherapy. The 5557A variant was found in three of twenty women (15%). Our data show that the prevalence of the 5557A allelic variant in cervical cancer subjects with adverse responses after irradiation probably does not differ from the prevalence common in Caucasians. A larger population study should confirm these preliminary results. ","331":"The local Chow Kit market is the largest wet market in the city of Kuala Lumpur. It is very close to the biggest government hospital in the city centre. However, the level of cleanliness in this area is always questionable and a matter of concern. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of T. gondii oocyst in water samples used by hawkers in that market and tissue cysts in rats' brains captured from the same area. Water samples were taken to the parasitology laboratory at the National Universtiy of MalaysiaUniversity and a sugar flotation concentration method was used. Supernatant microscopical examination was then performed. A total of 752 slides were screened for the presence of T. gondii oocyst. A hundred rats wandering in the same area were also captured by the hawkers using mousetraps. After each animal was sacrificed, and an electric microtome was used to cut out serial sections 5 microm thick from the rat brains. The de-waxed tissue sections were stained by the progressive Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stain for microscopical examination. A total of 1000 slides were screened under a light microscope to detect the presence of T. gondii brain cysts. All the water samples were found to be negative for T. gondii oocyst. Out of the 100 rats captured, three rats were found to possess T. gondii cysts in their brains. Water samples reflect minimal or no solid food contamination, while the 3% of positive brain cysts influence the researchers to broaden their investigations for future projects.","332":"Bronchial asthma and obesity is among a group ofmultietiologic complex diseases which influence each other in their origin, and development. The impact on the patient's quality of life and prognosis is significant, health costs included. Because of the increasing prevalence worldwide, there has been an increase in the amount of studies dealing with reciprocal associations between asthma and obesity.","333":"Wound healing is a complex physiological process important for tissue homeostasis. An acute injury initiates massive cell migration, proliferation and differentiation, synthesis of extracellular matrix components, scar formation and remodelling. Blood flow and tissue oxygenation are parts of the complex regulation of healing. Higher organisms utilize molecular oxygen as a terminal oxidant. This way of gaining energy for vital processes such as healing leads to the production of a number of oxygen compounds that may have a defensive or informatory role. They may be harmful when present in high concentrations. Both the lack and the excess of reactive oxygen species may influence healing negatively.","334":"Unilateral otosclerosis combined with avascular necrosis of stapes crura is a rare entity. It should be considered in a case of high grade otosclerosis. Symptoms are the same as in patients who suffer from common otosclerosis. Patients complain on progressive hearing loss and tinnitus. The diagnosis is made clinically by conventional audiologic evaluation and radiologically by x-ray mastoid Schuller's view and CT scan. HRCT scan makes visible all parts of ossicular chain and gives surgeon some information about ossicular chain damage. Surgery with stapedotomy and stapes prosthesis implantation in a case of otosclerosis with avascular necrosis of stapes crura can be success therapy to improve patient's hearing","335":"Brachial Plexus is formed by the union of the anterior rami of cervical 5, 6, 7, 8 and thoracic 1 nerves. These nerves unite and divide to form the key nerves innervating the upper limb. Variations in the course of these nerves are clinically important to anesthetists, neurologists and orthopedicians. We report bilateral variations in the arterial and neural structures in the upper limb of a 65 year old cadaver. The muscles of the arm on one side were innervated by the median nerve with absence ofmusculocutaneous. While on the other side the musculocutaneous nerve contributed to the formation of the median nerve. There was a presence of high bifurcation of brachial artery on both sides. Knowledge of such variations in the innervations of muscles and the arterial supply of the limbs are important to remember before performing any reconstructive procedures or interventions on the limb.","336":null,"337":"The current treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) consists of performing periodic whole blood phlebotomies. Erythrocytapheresis (EA) can remove up to three times more red blood cells per single procedure and could thus have a clinical benefit. A prospective study of 30 consecutive cases of HH were included in a periodic EA program. EA were performed using a discontinuous flow cell separators. The protocol consisted of a bimonthly EA until normalization of the serum ferritin was reached. The aim was to reduce the total erythrocyte volume by 25-35%, eventually, to adjust the amount so that hematocrit would not drop below 0.25. 530 +\/- 101 ml of erythrocytes were removed (median 517, range 116-761 ml). Iron depletion (ferritin &lt; 20 microg\/l) was achieved in all patients after a mean 6.9 +\/- 7.6 months, median 5 months, range 1-36 months and a mean 14 EA sessions. The procedures were well tolerated and there were no severe side-effects. We conclude that HH patients treated with EA achieved iron depletion quickly under good conditions of tolerance. The efficacy, speed, tolerability, and more favorable schedule of an EA program facilitate treatment of HH. ","338":"The presence of several risk factors (genetic and non-genetic) has greater impact on the risk of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) than single risk factor. The aim of the study was to establish possible relations between genotypes and alleles of 677C&gt;T polymorphism of MTHFR gene and some traditional risk factors e.g. elevated levels of lipid parameters and smoking in development of premature CAD. The groups comprised 152 patients with angiographically documented premature CAD (aged 42.9 +\/- 5.5) and 121 age-matched blood donors (aged 42.3 +\/- 6.5) were studied. The MTHFR 677C&gt;T polymorphism was genotyped with Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Patients with TT genotype who simultaneously smoked had increased risk of premature CAD compared to non-smoking cases with CC genotype (OR = 24.62). We also found that individuals with TT genotype and elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-chol.) level had significantly higher risk of CAD (OR = 9.92) than individuals with normal LDL-chol. level and CC genotype. The present study shows that simultaneous presence of MTHFR TT genotype and smoking or elevated levels of LDL-chol. influences the risk of premature CAD. This findings give interesting contribution to gene-environment interaction problem that may have clinical implications in the future. ","339":"Leptin is an adipokine which has a direct relationship to obesity. Our aim was to measure this hormone in pregnant women at three months intervals throughout their pregnancies to determine the serum value of those who developed preeclampsia. We followed 19 women (median age 24.8 +\/- 5.7 years) with pre-gestational Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 25 kg\/m2, 21 (median age 26.1 +\/- 4.6 years) with BMI higher than 25 kg\/m2 and 16 (median age 30.9 +\/- 5.8 years) with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) (median age 30.9 +\/- 5.8 years), recruited in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Serum levels of leptin were measured with radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique. In the first trimester of pregnancy leptin levels showed statistically significant differences between normal weight and overweight-obese women (p &lt; 0.001), diabetic women (p &lt; 0.05) and the subgroup of preeclamptic women (p &lt; 0.001). For those women with PGBMI &gt; or = 40 kg\/m2 and leptin &gt; or = 40 ng\/ml in the second trimester, the Odds Ratio (OR) to develop preeclampsia was of 47.95% CI (4.1-527.2). Analyzing leptin values with ROC curves, the greatest area under the curve (AUC) was for leptin in the second trimester (0.773, CI: 0.634-0.911). Women with morbid obesity (BMI &gt; or = 40 kg\/m2) had significantly higher levels of serum leptin (p &lt; 0.01) and a value of 40 ng\/ml of this hormone seems to be predictive of developing preeclampsia in this group of patients. ","340":"Dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing is one of the principal procedures in molecular biology. Loss of an initial part of nucleotides behind the 3' end of the sequencing primer limits the readability of sequenced amplicons. We present a method which extends the readability by using sequencing primers modified by polyadenylated tails attached to their 5' ends. Performing a polymerase chain reaction, we amplified eight amplicons of six human genes (AMELX, APOE, HFE, MBL2, SERPINA1 and TGFB1) ranging from 106 bp to 680 bp. Polyadenylation of the sequencing primers minimized the loss of bases in all amplicons. Complete sequences of shorter products (AMELX 106 bp, SERPINA1 121 bp, HFE 208 bp, APOE 244 bp, MBL2 317 bp) were obtained. In addition, in the case of TGFB1 products (366 bp, 432 bp, and 680 bp, respectively), the lengths of sequencing readings were significantly longer if adenylated primers were used. Thus, single strand dideoxynucleotide sequencing with adenylated primers enables complete or near complete readability of short PCR amplicons.","341":"The colorectal cancer ranks high among the malignant tumours in incidence and mortality and irinotecan is standardly used in palliative treatment of metastatic disease in every therapeutic line. Unfortunately, the treatment with irinotecan is often associated with severe toxicities, especially neutropenia and diarrhea. The majority of the toxic manifestation is caused by the insufficient deactivation (glucuronidation) of irinotecan active metabolite SN-38 by UGT1A enzyme. The elevated SN-38 plasma concentration is responsible for the hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity that can become life-threatening. The patients carrying the mutation of the gene encoding UGT1A enzyme lack the ability of bilirubin glucuronidation, and suffer from the inherited un-conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar type 1 and 2 syndrome). The mutations in other enzyme systems also play role in the etiopathogenesis of the irinotecan toxicity: CYP3A (cytochrome P-450), ABC family of transmembrane transporters (adenosine-triphosphate binding cassette). The goal of the contemporary research is to determine the predictive factors that will enable the individual adjustment of the individual drug dosage while minimising the adverse effects and maintaining the treatment benefit.","342":"There are many ways how children with mental illness have actually tried to hurt themselves. Suicidal thinking or attempts always indicate that professional help is needed (2). Every object which can be potential dangerous should be removed but this is very difficult to do. Some of children with these symptoms had Pica diseases. Pica is a medical disorder characterized by an appetite for substances largely non-nutritive (e.g. metal, coal, soil, feces, paper, soap, gum, etc.) or an abnormal appetite for some things that may be considered foods. The patient swallow sponge from a pillow over a long period of time and she came into our hospital with abdominal pain. She was 16 years old and had abdominal distension, vomiting, abdominal cramping and failure to pass gas or stool. Immediately we suspected mechanical blockade of the intestine. Diagnosis was clinically confirmed by X-rays of the abdomen and with ultrasound. The operative treatment was indicated and we found the proximal bowel distended and the distal segment collapsed. The part of bowel necrosis was removed and anastomosis was done. When patients are determined to attempt suicide or have Pica disorder it is very difficult to prevent. ","343":null,"344":"We present a rare case of eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in a 32-year-old woman caused by basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune. Diagnosis was done by the endoscopic nasal examination, computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses, the histopathological examination of polyps, the presence of eosinophils and fungal hyphae in nasal mucus and by the detection of S. commune by culture. The patient was successfully treated by combination of oral itraconazole and topical corticosteroid therapy combined with surgery. The pathogenesis and diagnosis of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis are also discussed.","345":"Ventriculoperitoneal shunts are associated with multiple complications. Among them are disconnection and migration of the tubing into the peritoneal cavity. Here we describe a case of a fractured ventriculoperitoneal shunt which migrated and coiled in the scrotum, masquerading as a scrotal swelling. Removal of the shunt via a scrotal incision was performed concomitantly with repair of the hernia sac.","346":"","347":"To characterize the time frame of changes in pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy and morphology of small pulmonary arteries male Wistar rats were exposed to isobaric hypoxia (3 weeks, F1O2 0.1) and then let to recover on air for 1 or 5 weeks. Normoxic animals (group N) served as controls. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), ratio of the weight of the right heart ventricle to the sum of the weights of the left ventricle and septum (RV\/LV+S) and percentage of double laminated pulmonary vessels ( % DL) were measured at the end of hypoxic exposure (group H), after 1 or 5 weeks of recovery (groups 1R and 5R), and in controls kept in air (group N). Three weeks in hypoxia resulted in increase in PAP, RV\/LV+S and % DL. After 1 week of recovery RV\/LV+S normalized, PAP decreased, while % DL did not change. After 5 weeks in air PAP returned to control values and % DL diminished significantly but did not normalize. Our results suggest that recovery depends on the degree of HPH and that knowledge of the time-frame of recovery is important for future studies in our rat model.","348":"The physical activity of the population is decreasing due to an increase in sedentary lifestyles. The aim of the study was to analyze midterm results of total knee arthroplasty according to the lifelong physical activity of the patients. We evaluated 37 patients (23 women, 14 men), with age average 70.0 years (range 53-87). We divided the patients according to lifelong physical activity. The active group included 11 patients with any history of physical activity and the passive included 26 patients with a sedentary lifestyle. No intergroup differences existed in age, gender or preoperative Knee Score. The active group had a higher postoperative Knee Score 90.5 (+\/- 5.0) compared to the passive 87.4 (+\/- 5.0). Pain after arthroplasty was experienced significantly more in the active group. Between the active 87.3 (+\/- 9.3) and passive 67.5 (+\/- 16.7) groups we measured a statistically significant difference in the improvement of Functional Score - ability to walk and climb stairs. Sedentary lifestyle affects the clinical outcomes of total knee arthroplasty. This data is demonstrating that physical activity ameliorate functional postoperative results.","349":"This study was designed to investigate the effects of melatonin on the bladder hyperactivity in hyperosmolar-induced overactive bladder (OAB) rats. Additionally, the influence of melatonin on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was assessed. 40 rats were divided into four groups: I--control (n = 12), II--rats with hyperosmolar OAB (n = 6), III--rats with melatonin pretreatment and hyperosmolar OAB (n = 6) and IV--control with melatonin pretreatment (n = 6). In group III and IV melatonin in dose of 100 mg\/kg was given. HRV measurements in 10 rats, as follow: control (n = 2), control after melatonin treatment (n = 2), rats with hyperosmolar OAB without (n = 3), and after (n = 3) melatonin treatment were conducted. This study demonstrates marked influence of melatonin on urinary bladder activity in hyperosmolar-induced OAB rats. These rats showed significantly reduced the detrusor motor overactivity resulting in the improvement of cystometric parameters after melatonin treatment when compared to the control, as follow: a significant increase of intercontraction interval (70%) and functional bladder capacity (67%), as well as a decrease of the basal pressure, detrusor overactivity index and motility index of 96%, 439% and 40%, respectively. ANS activity analysis revealed sympathetic overactivity in OAB rats, and parasympathetic superiority in melatonin treated OAB rats. Melatonin treatment in rats with hyperosmolar OAB (group III) caused significant increase of nuHF parameter (from 51.00 +\/- 25.29 to 76.97 +\/- 17.43), as well as a decrease of nuLF parameter (from 49.01 +\/- 25.26 to 23.03 +\/- 17.43) and LF\/HF ratio (from 1.280 +\/- 0.980 to 0.350 +\/- 0.330). In conclusion, melatonin suppresses hyperosmolar OAB, and modulates ANS activity by inhibition of the sympathetic drive. Therefore, melatonin may become a useful agent for OAB management.","350":"Goeckerman's therapy (GT) of psoriasis is based on daily application of pharmacy grade coal tar on affected skin with subsequent exposure to UV light. Disturbances in angiogenic activity are characteristic for the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. The aim of study was to evaluate the influence of GT of psoriasis on proinflammatory and angiogenic activities expressed as changes in levels of endoglin (CD105). Serum levels of a soluble form of endoglin were measured in peripheral blood samples of 38 patients with psoriasis before and after therapy. Sixty three otherwise healthy blood donors serve as a control group. The efficacy of GT was expressed as changes in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). PASI score was significantly diminished by GT (p &lt; 0.001). Serum levels of soluble CD105 were significantly diminished after GT. The serum level of soluble CD105 dropped from 7.85 +\/- 2.26 ng\/ml before therapy to 7.01 +\/- 1.71 ng\/ml after therapy (p = 0.0002). Compared to serum levels of soluble CD105 in healthy blood donors, serum levels of soluble CD105 in patients before GT were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) and remained elevated after therapy (p &lt; 0.001). Angiogenic activity expressed as serum endoglin is diminished in patients with psoriasis treated by GT.

In addition, subpleural curvilinear shadow was found in the bilateral upper lungs. A bronchoalveolar lavage obtained from the right middle lobe showed 25 % eosinophils. Although very rare, we should therefore keep in mind that patients, who have patchy consolidation with areas of subpleural curvilinear shadow in the bilateral upper lungs, may have chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.","353":"Granular cell tumors are benign subcutaneous or submucosal lesions of neurogenic origin. In this case study one patient was diagnosed and treated successfully with complete surgical resection of a laryngeal granular cell tumor that was originated from the left arytenoid region that very rare location. There is no evidence of recurrence 2 years after surgery. Granular cell tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis of laryngeal masses, particularly in the posterior glottis.","354":"Chylothorax is a rare but severe complication of cardiac surgery. The authors present the case of a 76-year-old woman suffering from ischemic heart disease, after coronary artery bypass grafting that included a left internal mammary artery pedicle graft.

Combined treatment with pleural drainage and total parenteral nutrition was effective.","355":"","356":"","357":"This prospective observational study was done to analyse the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among primigravidae and its outcome. All healthy primigravidae with singleton pregnancies were offered universal glucose tolerance testing between 16 and 28 weeks gestation. GDM and non GDM groups were managed according to hospital protocol. The antenatal features and pregnancy outcomes were analysed. Out of 616 primigravidae, 113 (18.34%) were GDM with slightly older (27.9 +\/- 4.2 versus 26.32 +\/- 3.3, p &lt; 0.001) age. The mean fasting and two hours postprandial blood glucose in both groups were 4.99 +\/- 1.08 mmol\/l, 8.86 +\/- 1.41 mmol\/l(GDM) and 4.36 +\/- 0.43 mmol\/l, 5.71 +\/- 1.11 mmol\/l (Non GDM), respectively. Maternal family history of diabetes mellitus, weight exceeding 80 Kg, polyhydramnios (2.65% versus 0.2%, p = 0.028) and neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia (9.73% versus 2.98%, p = 0.01) occurred significantly more frequent in the GDM group compared to normal. There was no significant difference in other pregnancy outcomes and complications between the two groups. In conclusion GDM in primigravidae was detected at a relatively young age with more frequent maternal family history of DM, weight exceeding 80 Kg, polyhydromnions and neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. The degree of disease was mild and treatment led to no significant complication.","358":"The study was designed to evaluate the clinical outcome of a composite material, beta-tricalcium phosphate in combination with calcium sulphate, in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. The combination of these materials is believed to aid in guided tissue regeneration owing to their properties. A total of 47 teeth with intrabony defects in 26 periodontitis patients were treated with Fortoss Vital (Biocomposites, Staffordshire, U.K.). Clinical parameters were evaluated which included changes in probing depth, clinical attachment level\/loss and gingival recession at the baseline and 2 years postoperatively. The mean differences in measurements between the baseline and 2 years postoperatively were a reduction of 2.07 +\/- 1.14 mm (p = 0.000) in case of probing depth and a gain of 1.93 +\/- 1.36 mm (p = 0.000) in clinical attachment level; but an increase of 0.14 +\/- 0.73 mm (p = 0.571) in gingival recession. The study results show that the treatment with a combination of beta tricalcium phosphate and calcium sulphate led to a significantly favorable clinical improvement in periodontal intrabony defects 2 years after the surgery.","359":"The aim of our study was to evaluate duplex ultrasonography (DUS) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in detection of haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (RAS). The study included patients with high clinical suspicion of renovascular hypertension (RVH). The imaging of renal arteries was performed by DUS, MRA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Significant RAS was defined as maximum systolic velocity &gt; or =180 cm\/sec (DUS) or as 60% reduction of the endoluminal arterial diameter (MRA, DSA). The results of DUS and MRA were assessed in respect to the results of DSA. Arterial supply of 186 kidneys in 94 patients was evaluated. DSA revealed significant RAS in 61 kidneys evaluated. DUS was not able to examine arterial supply in 18 kidneys of 13 patients. In the detection of significant RAS, DUS was characterized by sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 84%. MRA achieved satisfactory imaging quality in all but one kidney evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of MRA in the detection of significant RAS was 93% and 93%, respectively. In patients with high clinical probability of RVH, MRA proved to be more reliable and superior in both sensitivity and specificity to DUS in the detection of significant RAS. ","360":"Almost all orally administered drugs are absorbed across the intestinal mucosa. The Caco-2 monolayers are used as an in vitro model to predict drug absorption in humans and to explore mechanism of drug absorption. The Caco-2 cells are derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma and spontaneously differentiate to form confluent monolayer of polarized cells structurally and functionally resembling the small intestinal epithelium. For studying drug permeability, Caco-2 cells are seeded onto the Transwell inserts with semipermeable membrane and grown to late confluence (21 days). After determination of cell viability, the integrity of monolayer is checked by phenol red permeability and by 14C-mannitol permeability. The transport from apical to basolateral (AP-BL) and basolateral to apical (BL-AP) is studied by adding the diluted drug on the apical or basolateral side and withdrawing the samples from the opposite compartment, respectively, for HPLC analysis or liquid scintillation spectrometry. Ca2+ -free transport medium is used to determine paracellular component of the drug transport. On the basis of permeability and solubility, drugs can be categorized into four classes of Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). For certain drugs, the BCS-based biowaiver approach can be used which enables to reduce in vivo bioequivalence studies.","361":"","362":"Podocin mutations (NPHS2 gene) are mostly responsible for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) of childhood onset. Patients with NPHS2 gene mutations do not respond to corticoids and other immunosuppressive agents; partial remission can be rarely induced by cyclosporin A. We present a boy, where SRNS was diagnosed within first year of life. By the age of 15 years, proteinuria reached 9000 mg\/24 h, cholesterolemia 15 mmol\/L, albuminemia 19.6 g\/L, in spite of combined therapy with cyclosporine A, methylprednisolone, enalapril and losartan. At that time a combined heterozygous form of two NPHS2 gene mutations (p.R138Q and p.V290M) was diagnosed, methylprednisolone was discontinued and patient underwent ten plasmapheresis procedures. This resulted in clinical improvement (proteinuria 3000 mg\/24 h, S-cholesterol 6 mmol\/L, albumin 30g\/L) lasting for three years. In conclusion, plasmapheresis can result in clinical improvement and stabilization of SRNS caused by podocine mutation, before renal replacement therapy is initiated.","363":"Neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands is a variant of Sweet's syndrome.

Prolonged fasting is thought to be among risk factors for many diseases, e.g., cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and various infectious diseases. It could also play a part in several eye diseases, including dry eye syndrome, glaucoma, and cataract. Toxic and oxidative effects due to increased concentrations of some biochemicals as a result of reduction in tear volume thought to play an important role in damaging ocular tissue. Human tear is an important biological fluid similar to blood in many aspects. Tear film is composed of three basic layers i.e. lipid, aqueous and mucin. The tear film covering the ocular surface presents a mechanical and antimicrobial barrier, and endures an optical refractive surface. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare tear protein of volunteers during fasting. Using two reliable analytical methods, i.e. electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we compared tear protein content of sixty volunteers (35 males and 25 females, 23-27 years old) during fasting in holly month of Ramadan (FAST: n = 62) and one month before Ramadan (CTRL: n = 60). The results showed that some identified tear proteins decreased during fasting. On the other hand, the activity of some enzymes such as lysozyme, lactoferrin and alpha amylase also decreased in fasting samples. Electrophoresis results showed that tear protein patterns in FAST (P &lt; 0.05) were different from those of CTRL. There were a few more protein peaks in the FAST group (P &lt; 0.005) than in CTRL.","365":"The authors evalute the visual functions of patients with unilateral central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and compare them with their non-affected eye and with a control group. Fourteen patients with CSC treated with direct laser-photocoagulation were examined preoperatively and followed-up, up to 2 years postoperatively. Baseline best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) of both eyes of patients was significantly lower in comparison with the controls. BCVA and CS in affected eyes were significantly lower compared to the fellow eye of patients. The final BCVA and CS of patients did not differ significantly from the controls, except CS of affected eyes in the spatial frequency of 3.69 c\/deg. Two years after laser treatment, there were only nonsignificant differences of both photopic full-field electroretinography (phERG) and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) responses between the treated, the nonaffected eye of the patients and the control group with exception of a significantly longer P1 implicit time in the parafoveolar region in affected eyes. Colour discrimination was normal in 85.8% of affected eyes of the patients. Despite a significant improvement of macular function in CSC eyes, functional examination methods do not prove complete resolution of function 2 years after laser-treatment.","366":"Measurement of parameters of energy requirement, respiratory quotient (RQ), rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) and rate of carbon dioxide production (VCO2) reveal Ringerfundin as an excellent and metabolically stable-acting balanced ionic solution, which does not increase the consumption of O2 or the total energy requirement. In conclusion, Ringerfundin was very well tolerated and in no case were observed undesirable effects.","367":"The recently recognized cytokine interleukin-33 and its receptor ST2 play a favorable role during atherogenesis by inducing a Th1 --&gt; Th2 shift of the immune response. IL-33 also protects the failing human heart from harmful biomechanical forces which lead to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and exaggerated interstitial fibrosis. IL-33 inevitably displays side effects common to other Th2 cytokines, the most grave of which is a predisposition to allergic reactions. IL-33 is a nuclear transcription factor of endothelial cells. As such, it is abundant in nonproliferating vessels. Its down-regulation is required for angiogenesis, which may be profitable in wound healing or deleterious in tumor growth.","368":"","369":"Although sarcoidosis as well as lung cancer are frequently encountered common diseases, their metachronous or synchronous occurrence in the same patient is very rare. The charts of lung cancer patients, diagnosed between 1980 and 2007 in our hospital, were reviewed. We found 3 cases with sarcoidosis and lung cancer. The first case had lung cancer 16 years after the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The second case had two different metachronous lung cancers 18 and 10 years after the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The third case detected these two diseases simultaneously. In simultaneously detected cases, it is difficult to determine whether noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas coexisting with lung cancer represent sarcoid reaction or genuine systemic sarcoidosis. Either causality or coincidence, lung cancer, a condition that can be observed in patients with sarcoidosis, should be considered in the differential diagnosis when suspicious findings of it are discovered. ","370":"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a serious condition affecting mostly women. This report concerns two cases of women who developed CVT within 14 days of cesarean delivery. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain (venous phase) is the best modality to diagnose the condition, and parenteral application of low-molecular-weight heparin is the most beneficial treatment. The first patient was found to have an elevated factor VIII level. In the second patient, homozygosity of the C677T mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene was found. The puerperal period and Cesarean Section (CS) are risk factors for thrombotic complications, including CVT. It is necessary to search for risk factors in a patient's history and within the group of at-risk patients to prolong preventive administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). CVT (including puerperium related) is not a detrimental to future pregnancies.","371":"Few studies concerning the importance of food allergy in adolescents and adult patients with atopic eczema exist. The atopy patch tests with food have mostly been studied in infants and children since food allergy plays a role especially in this age group. The evaluation of the contribution of atopy patch tests in the diagnostic work-up of food allergy (to wheat, cow milk, peanuts, soya and eggs) in the patients with atopic eczema older than 14 years of age. 120 patients were examined in the study in the diagnostic work-up of food allergy--86 women and 34 men, the mean age 26.5 (s.d. 9.8) and the median SCORAD at the beginning of the study 32.9 (s.d. 14.0). Complete dermatological and allergological examinations in the diagnostic work-up of food allergy were performed (assessment of personal history, assessment of serum specific IgE, skin prick tests, atopy patch tests, diagnostic hypoallergenic diet, food challenge tests with egg, soy, wheat, cow milk and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge test with cow milk and wheat. The results of atopy patch tests were compared with the results of other diagnostic methods in the diagnosis of food allergy. The food allergy to cow milk and wheat was confirmed in double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge test in few patients in our study (4%). The suspicion of food allergy to egg is in 8 %, to peanuts in 13 % and to soya in 4 % of patients in our study. The assessment of atopy patch tests response seems to be of great importance. The reaction in atopy patch tests with more papules has the greatest diagnostic accuracy for predicting the result of challenge tests. At the beginning and at the end of diagnostic hypoallergenic diet the severity of atopic eczema\/dermatitis syndrome was recorded in all patients enrolled in the study by evaluating SCORAD. The decrease of SCORAD was statistically important. Atopy patch tests alone cannot be used as a single test for the determination of food allergy in patients with atopic eczema\/dermatitis syndrome but such a test, together with other diagnostic methods, can help to trace the food allergy. ","372":"Our aims were to isolate stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED), to cultivate them in vitro and to investigate their basic biological properties, phenotype and to compare our findings with dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) isolated from permanent teeth. Dental pulp was gently evacuated from exfoliated teeth. After enzymatic dissociation of dental pulp, SHED were cultivated in modified cultivation media for mesenchymal adult progenitor cells containing 2% FCS and supplemented with growth factors and insulin, transferrin, sodium (ITS) supplement. Cell viability and other biological properties were examined using a Vi-Cell analyzer and a Z2-Counter. DNA analyses and phenotyping were performed with flow cytometry. We were able to cultivate SHED over 45 population doublings. Our results showed that SHED cultivated under same conditions as DPSC had longer average population doubling time (41.3 hrs for SHED vs. 24.5 hrs for DPSC). Phenotypic comparison of cultivated SHED to that of cultivated DPSC showed differential expression CD29, CD44, CD71, CD117, CD 166. During long-term cultivation, SHED did not showed any signs of degeneration or spontaneous differentiation. We isolated stem cells from exfoliated teeth. In comparison to DPSC, SHED proliferation rate was about 50% slower, and SHED showed slightly different phenotype. These cells may be extremely useful for stem cell tissue banking, further stem cell research and future therapeutic applications. ","373":"The ability of newly developed oximes (K347, K628) to reduce tabun-induced acute neurotoxic signs and symptoms was compared with currently available oximes (obidoxime, HI-6) using a functional observational battery. The neuroprotective effects of the oximes studied (K347, K628, obidoxime, HI-6) combined with atropine on rats poisoned with tabun at a sublethal dose (220 microg\/kg i.m.; 80% of LD50 value) were evaluated. Tabun-induced neurotoxicity was monitored by a functional observational battery and automatic measurement of motor activity at 24 hours following tabun challenge. The results indicate that all tested oximes combined with atropine enable tabun-poisoned rats to survive 24 hours following tabun challenge. Both newly developed oximes (K347, K628) combined with atropine are able to decrease tabun-induced neurotoxicity in the case of sublethal poisonings but they do not eliminate all tabun-induced acute neurotoxic signs and symptoms. Their ability to decrease the tabun-induced acute neurotoxicity is higher than that of the oxime HI-6 and it is slightly slower than the neuroprotective efficacy of obidoxime. As the neuroprotective potency of both newly developed oximes (K347, K628) is not as high as the potency of obidoxime, they are not a suitable replacement for obidoxime for the treatment of acute tabun poisonings.","374":"Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) can be easily isolated and cultured in low-serum containing medium supplemented with growth factors PDGF-BB and EGF while exhibiting multipotency and immature phenotypic characteristics. In the present study, we investigated their potential to differentiate towards osteogenic lineages using various culture conditions in order to optimize their therapeutic use. DPSCs were cultured either as a cell monolayer or as three-dimensional (3D) micro-mass structures. Monolayers preincubated with bFGF and valproic acid for one week prior their differentiation were cultured in serum containing standard osteodifferentiation medium for four weeks, which resulted in multilayered nodule formation. Micro-mass structures were cultured for same period either in serum containing medium or under serum-free conditions supplemented with TGF-beta3 with or without BMP-2. Histochemically, we detected massive collagen I and weak calcium phosphate depositions in multilayered nodules. When culture 3D-aggregates in either standard osteodifferentiation medium or serum-free medium containing TGF-beta3, only small amount of collagen I fibres was observed and almost no deposits of calcium phosphate were detected. In contrast, in presence of both TGF-beta3 and BMP-2 in the serum-free medium a significant amount of collagen I fibers\/bundles and calcification were detected, which is in line with osteogenic effect of BMP-2. Thus, our data indicate that certain environmental cues can enhance differentiation process of DPSCs into osteogenic lineage, which suggest their possible utilization in tissue engineering.","375":"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a specialized subpopulation of T cells that act to suppress immune response, thereby maintaining homeostasis and self-tolerance. It has been shown that Tregs are able to inhibit T cell proliferation and cytokine production and play a critical role in preventing autoimmunity. Different subsets with various functions of Treg cells exist. Tregs can be usually identified by flow cytometry. The most specific marker for these cells is FoxP3, which is localized intracellulary. Selected surface markers such as CD25high (high molecular density) and CD127low (low molecular density) could serve as surrogate markers to detect Tregs in a routine clinical practice. Dysregulation in Treg cell frequency or functions may lead to the development of autoimmune disease. Therapeutical Treg modulation is considered to be a promising therapeutical approach to treat some selected disorders, such as allergies, and to prevent allograft rejection.","376":"Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is a minimally invasive endovascular procedure that has played an important role in the treatment of acute or repeated variceal bleeding or refractory ascites. The standard venous access route for this procedure is the right jugular vein. Sometimes it is better to use the left jugular vein because of lower probability of life threatening complication or technical failure. In this case reports the authors have described their experience with TIPS creation in two patients with persistent left and absent right superior vena cava and recommend using the left jugular vein as an access route in this rare anatomical variant.","377":"The purpose of this report was to present an unusual case of an unilateral tonsillar hypertophy caused by actinomycosis. It is an infrequent bacterial infection nowadays. Only five such cases have been reported up to now. Diagnosis is difficult, because there are not specific diagnostic procedures. Medical treatment consists of surgical excision of tonsils and postoperative antibiotic therapy.","378":"Cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis (CMUSE) is a rare condition characterised by chronic or relapsing moderate ileous episodes resulting from multiple small intestinal strictures, multiple shallow ulcers of the small bowel and favourable therapeutical effect of glucocorticosteroids. The aim of this paper was to evaluate three cases of CMUSE diagnosed within 10 years at a tertiary gastroenterology centre. Three females (35, 50, 60 years) were presented with colicky pain, repeated moderate ileous episodes and weight loss. Multiple fibrous strictures and ulcers of the small bowel were found. All three patients responded to glucocorticosteroid treatment. Tandem tight jejunal stenoses were dilated endoscopically by means of double balloon enteroscopy. In conclusion, CMUSE should always be considered when chronic moderate ileous episodes and multiple small intestinal strictures and ulcers of uncertain aetiology are found. Double balloon enteroscopy enables precise diagnostic work, possible endoscopic treatment of stenoses, may obviate the need for surgery and prevent excessive small bowel resections.","379":"Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet-tasting but poisonous type of alcohol found in many household products. The major use of ethylene glycol is as an antifreeze in, for example, automobiles, in air conditioning systems, in de-icing fluid for windshields, and else. People sometimes drink ethylene glycol mistakenly or on purpose as a substitute for alcohol. Ethylene glycol is toxic, and its drinking should be considered a medical emergency. The major danger from ethylene glycol is following ingestion. Due to its sweet taste, peoples and occasionally animals will sometimes consume large quantities of it if given access to antifreeze. While ethylene glycol itself has a relatively low degree of toxicity, its metabolites are responsible for extensive cellular damage to various tissues, especially the kidneys. This injury is caused by the metabolites, glycolic and oxalic acid and their respective salts, through crystal formation and possibly other mechanisms. Toxic metabolites of ethylene glycol can damage the brain, liver, kidneys, and lungs. The poisoning causes disturbances in the metabolism pathways, including metabolic acidosis. The disturbances may be severe enough to cause profound shock, organ failure, and death. Ethylene glycol is a common poisoning requiring antidotal treatment.","380":"Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) is a DNA damage-inducible protein kinase, which phosphorylates plethora of substrates participating in DNA damage response. ATM significance for the cell faith is undeniable, since it regulates DNA repair, cell-cycle progress, and apoptosis.

Due to previous diagnostics difficulties the real prevalence of this disease was underestimated for a long time. The pathogenesis of NSAID-enteropathy is more multifactorial and complex than formerly assumed but has still not been fully uncovered. A combination of the local and systemic effect plays an important role in pathogenesis. Thanks to novel enteroscopy methods (wireless capsule endoscopy, double balloon enteroscopy), small bowel lesions are described in a substantial section of NSAID users although most are clinically asymptomatic. The other non-invasive tests (small bowel permeability, faecal calprotectin, scintigraphy using faecal excretion of 111-indium-labelled leukocytes etc.) proposed for diagnostics are not generally used in clinical practice, mainly because of their non-specificity. Despite intensive research into possible treatment, the main measure for patients with NSAID-enteropathy is still withdrawal of NSAIDs. Double balloon enteroscopy plays an important role in the treatment of complications (bleeding, strictures).","382":"Partial or total pneumatization of the middle turbinate is called concha bullosa. It's one of the most common anatomic variations of the lateral nasal wall. The exact reason of such pneumatization is not known. It can originate from the frontal recess, middle meatus, sinus lateralis or, less frequently, from the posterior ethmoid cells. Concha bullosa remains usually asymptomatic. However, an extensively pneumatized middle turbinate may constitute space-occupying mass, and thus, it may cause nasal obstruction. We report an extremely rare case of a patient with a large, doubly septated concha bullosa with four different sources of aeration.","383":"The records of Forensic Medicine Council of Turkey Bursa Morgue Department reveal the first case of fatal methanol ingestion in a child. Household methanol exposures are mostly due to accidental ingestion of washing fluids.

We studied 225 women between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation with PPROM. Cervical swabs were obtained for genital mycoplasmas and standard vaginal smears of bacterial culture were performed at the time of patients' admission. In the control group were 225 women with a normal pregnancy. Ureaplasma urealyticum was detected in 68% (152\/225) and Mycoplasma hominis was detected in 28% (63\/225) of the patients with PPROM between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation and. In the control group Ureaplasma urealyticum was found in 17% (38\/225) and Mycoplasma hominis in 15% (35\/225) pregnant women. Our results provide evidence of an association between cervical colonization with genital mycoplasmas and preterm premature rupture of the membranes. ","386":"Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis associated with Psoriasis. Its recognition as an inflammatory disease distinct from Rheumatoid Arthritis has put forward for consideration several questions regarding its specific CVS mortality and morbidity (9, 11, 16, 26). Carotid intima media thickness is a useful surrogate and sensitive marker to determine atherosclerosis even in its subclinical stages (6, 14, 22, 27, 32). Prevalence of carotid intima media thickness in patients with Psoriatic arthritis is unknown in Asian population. We aim to identify the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with psoriatic arthritis and disease activity association and its predictors in a series of patients with PsA attended to the rheumatology clinic, tertiary hospitals. A total of 63 patients with PsA who fulfilled the CASPAR criteria were recruited from UKM Medical Centre and Hospital Putrajaya. Common carotid intima media thickness (IMT) was measured in both right and left carotid artery by using high resolution B-mode ultrasound. This was a cross sectional study first done in Malaysia for PsA patients. The positive IMT (IMT &gt; 1.00 mm) among PsA was observed in 10 out of 63 patients (15.9 %) regardless of background cardiovascular risk. The mean +\/- SD of IMT was 0.725 +\/-0.260 mm for this study. Variables significantly associated with positive IMT (p &lt; 0.05) included age at the time of study (p = 0.005), waist circumference (p = 0.001), Hypertension (p = 0.007), Diabetes (p = 0.002) and Metabolic syndrome (p = 0.001) and not associated with gender, ethnicity, duration of PsA disease, pattern of PsA, disease activity and severity. Above all, only age had positive IMT independent predictor (p = 0.032), with OR 1.116; 95 % CI (1.010-1.234). There was a significant association between CVS risk and positive Intima Media Thickness in Psoriatic Arthritis patients. Otherwise, there was no association in disease activity, disease severity and DMARDS therapy with positive Intima Media Thickness in Psoriatic Arthritis patients. The study was approved by Research and Ethics Committee of the faculty of medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia with project code FF-114-2008 and by Community Research Center (CRC) of National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the case study in Hospital Putrajaya with the project code NMRR-08-970-2125.

It is a valuable model for basic biology research of cell cycle control as well as for clinically oriented studies of wide and heterogeneous group of liver diseases. This article provides a concise review of current knowledge about the liver regeneration, focusing mainly on rat partial hepatectomy model. The three main recognized phases of the regenerative response are described.

These weapons use radioactive materials to disperse and emit ionizing radiation. There are two classes of radiological weapons--radiological dispersal devices (RDD) and radiation emission devices (RED). These weapons would no cause massive numbers of dead. In most radiological attack scenarios, only few people may die immediately or shortly after exposure to the ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, many people could develop cancer within several years to decade after the radiological weapon attack. Such attack might spur panic and result in high economic costs because of the need for decontamination and possible tearing down and reconstruction of contaminated structures. Thus, radiological weapons may be considered rather weapons of mass disruption than weapons threating of human life.","390":"Discoid meniscus is the commonest anatomical aberration of the knee joint, among rare cases such as bilateral separated lateral meniscus, accessory lateral meniscus, partial deficiency of the lateral meniscus and double-layered lateral meniscus. An 11-year-old girl presented with history of chronic pain in her right knee for the last 6 months. The problem disturbed her involvement in the sport activities at school. Clinical examination revealed a clicking sensation on knee extension with lateral joint line tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her right knee showed torn posterior horn of lateral meniscus. Arthroscopy examination revealed a discoid meniscus with absence posterior horn. Posterior horn deficient discoid meniscus is a rare form of a congenital meniscus anomaly. We as clinicians believe that the abnormal shaped meniscus may pose a diagnostic challenge clinically and radiologically. Presentation of this case may be beneficial for orthopaedicians in their daily clinical practice.","391":"We present a 20-year-old Malay male whom we believe has Proteus syndrome, a rare congenital disorder of asymmetrical overgrowth of body tissues. There are fewer than 100 confirmed cases reported worldwide thus the clinical presentation and histopathological findings are of significance. Our patient presented with an overgrown right small finger and subcutaneous purplish pigmentation over his left upper arm and chest since birth. His small finger gradually increased in size. He had no abnormalities in sensation or power. Radiographs revealed a delta shaped middle phalanx of the small finger. His activities of daily living were uninterrupted but he requested debulking surgery for cosmetic reasons. Histopathological examination reported hypertrophic fatty tissue composed of well formed lobules of mature adipocytes interspersed with fibrous elements.","392":"In modern medicine professional relationship between the clinician and the patient is patient-centered. Patients become actively involved in the treatment decision making process and are encouraged to express their health-related preferences. Some patients may, however, refuse a favorable risk\/benefit ratio treatment. This manuscript presents three cases of refusal of treatment by mentally competent surgical patients and discusses differences in their management. To achieve the best medical outcome for patients who possess the Actual Understanding test of mental competence clinicians use the deliberate model of medical professional relationship. For patients demonstrating the Understanding test of mental competence and wishing to utilize their health-related preferences physicians are obliged to deploy the interpretive model of doctor-patient relationship. In mentally competent patients with an illness-induced acute psychological regression the interpretive model of doctor-patient relationship as an initial strategy and cognitive behavior therapy can be useful in modifying treatment rejecting behavior and improving medical outcome.

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical outcome of a composite material, beta tricalcium phosphate in combination with calcium sulphate in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. The combination of these materials is believed to aid in guided tissue regeneration owing to their properties. Thirty nine intrabony defects in 21 patients were treated with Fortoss Vital (Biocomposites, Staffordshire, UK). Clinical parameters were evaluated including changes in probing depth, clinical attachment level\/loss and gingival recession at baseline and one year postoperatively. The mean differences in measurements between the baseline and one year postoperatively are a reduction of 1.98 +\/- 1.16 mm (p = 0.000) in case of probing depth and a gain of 1.68 +\/- 1.12 mm (p = 0.000) in clinical attachment level and an increase of 0.31 +\/- 0.67 mm (p = 0.009) in gingival recession measurements. The study results show that the treatment with a combination of beta tricalcium phosphate and calcium sulphate led to a significantly favorable clinical improvement in periodontal intrabony defects one year postoperatively.","395":"Interleukin 6 plays an important role in chronic heart failure (HF), but little is known about its involvement in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). The aim of our study is to evaluate the prognostic role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the patients with ADHF. Plasma levels of interleukin IL-6, N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide levels, and clinical covariates were measured in 92 patients with ADHF. Survival was followed up to 12 months, and prognostic factors were evaluated. Elevated plasma IL-6 levels were increased in nonsurvivors and were associated with 1-year mortality (p &lt; 0.01). Plasma IL-6 levels were associated with plasma NT-proBNP levels. In multivariate analysis, increased plasma IL-6 and NT-proBNP levels remained strong independent predictors of 1-year mortality. Plasma IL-6 levels provide important prognostic information in the patients with ADHF. Measurement combining plasma IL-6 and NT-proBNP should serve as a powerful prognostic tool of multimarker strategy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. ","396":"The study was aimed at the experimental assessment of the efficacy of recombinant interleukin-1beta in the early therapy of haemopoiesis disorders caused by X-ray irradiation. The efficacy of the product was based on the 30-day survival rate and average life expectancy of dead animals. Endogenous and exogenous colony-formations were studied to reveal possible mechanisms of therapeutic effects of interleukin-1beta on the bone marrow. The early administration (10-15 min after exposure to radiation) of recombinant interleukin-1beta in a dose of 50 microg\/kg increased the survival rate and prevented the post-irradiation decrease in the number of endogenous and exogenous CFU-S9 in irradiated mice.","397":"Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has recently undergone several major changes. Most importantly, large randomized trials (CLL-8 in first line and REACH in relapse) clearly demonstrated superiority of chemoimmunotherapy consisting of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) over fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) alone, thus establishing FCR regimen as the new gold standard in younger and physically fit patients. However, management of elderly and\/or comorbid patients is still a challenging task because they cannot be treated with agressive approaches due to high risk of unacceptable toxicity. To date, no randomized trials in this patient population have improved therapeutic results over chlorambucil; therefore, this agent remains the backbone of treatment against which the new protocols should be tested. When deciding about the intensity of treatment, performance status, biological age and number as well as severity of comorbidities should be taken into account. Emerging treatment concepts for elderly\/comorbid patients include combination of chlorambucil with monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, ofatumumab, GA-101), fludarabine-based regimens in reduced doses or protocols based on bendamustine and lenalidomide. Combination of high-dose steroids with rituximab represent a promising option in relapsed\/refractory CLL; however, infectious toxicity remains a serious issue. Finally, ofatumumab monotherapy appears to be a safe and effective therapy for heavily pretreated patients with CLL. This article reviews the current and future possibilities in the treatment of elderly and comorbid patients with CLL.","398":"The studies dealing with mechanism of organophosphates (OP)\/nerve agent action, prophylaxis and treatment of intoxications is a very hot topic at present. Though the research is very intensive, unfortunately, up to now, there is not universal or significantly better reactivator sufficiently effective against all nerve agents\/OP when compared with presently available oximes (pralidoxime, methoxime, obidoxime, trimedoxime, HI-6). The use of the most effective reactivator (HI-6) using simple type of autoinjector (e.g. ComboPen) is strictly limited because of decomposition of HI-6 in solution. Thanks to better solubility it is clear that another salt of HI-6 (dimethanesulfonate, HI-6 DMS) is more convenient for the use as antidote against nerve agents in the autoinjector than HI-6 chloride (Cl). It was clearly demonstrated that reactivation potency of HI-6 DMS in comparison with HI-6 Cl in vivo was the same and bioavailability of HI-6 DMS is better than that of HI-6 Cl. Three chambered autoinjector allows administration of all three antidotes (atropine, reactivator, diazepam) simultaneously. Moreover, the content of chambers can be changed according to proposed requirements. Possible way to solve the problem of universal reactivator could be the use of two reactivators. Three chambered autoinjector is an ideal device for this purpose.","399":"An article describes diagnostic difficulties in patient with giant renal cyst, erroneously diagnosed as ascites on ultrasonographic examination.

The limitations of ultrasonographic examination are pointed out are and a brief review of similar cases is given.","400":"Proximal migration of the distal end of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt has been observed much more rarely than other numerous shunt-related complications. Subgaleal migration of the peritoneal end is one of the samples. In the preset report we have discussed a case of subgaleal migration of the peritoneal end detected as a result of the examinations performed for shunt dysfunction. There was ventricular dilatation on CT scan of the brain. X-ray examinations confirmed proper ventricular catheter and shunt valve placement but a complete migration of distal (peritoneal) catheter into the subgaleal space. Then the patient's shunt was revised. When our case and the literature were examined, we observed that this complication was frequently encountered during the first postoperative months, in the pediatric ages and in patients with advanced hydrocephalus. Besides, we have detected that the peritoneal catheters had tendency to migration into the subgaleal tissues similar to pre-insertion forms of the preoperatively original packages.","401":"Disease phobia refers to a psychological state when the person continuously thinks that he\/she is sick and improvement from the condition is impossible. Disease phobia in patients suffering from pain, secondary to temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), is usually the consequence of long-term problems; diagnosis and treatment of this group is a real challenge for healthcare professionals. The purpose of this prospective study was to objectively evaluate the role of Illness Attitude Scale (Kellner or IAS) in measuring cancerophobia and heart disease phobia in patients suffering from pain, as a consequence of TMDs. The cohort included 22 patients with TMDs who underwent evaluation of these phobias; pain was acute in 7 and chronic in 15. The patients were asked to complete the \"Kellner\" questionnaire, and this was followed by full clinical examination of the temporomandibular region. When measuring the correlation between the cancerophobia and heart disease phobia patients, the outcome was found significant in the total cohort, p &lt; 0.01. Comparisons were carried out in the chronic group (n = 15) and was significant (p = 0.034 and r = 0.549); while in the acute group no significance was identified. Cancerophobia and heart disease phobia in TMD patients are factors that need to be taken in consideration when managing chronic pain in this group. ","402":"Ca(2+)-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) is involved in induction of apoptotic and necrotic processes. We studied sensitivity of MPTP to calcium using the model of Ca(2+)-induced, cyclosporine A-sensitive mitochondrial swelling. Presented data indicate that the extent of mitochondrial swelling (dA520\/4 min) induced by addition of 25 microM Ca2+ is seven-fold higher in liver than in heart mitochondria (0.564 +\/- 0.08\/0.077 +\/- 0.01). The extent of swelling induced by 100 microM Ca2+ was in liver tree times higher than in heart mitochondria (0.508 +\/- 0.05\/ 0.173 +\/- 0.02). Cyclosporine A sensitivity showed that opening of the MPTP is involved. We may thus conclude that especially at low Ca2+ concentration heart mitochondria are more resistant to damaging effect of Ca2+ than liver mitochondria. These finding thus support hypothesis that there exist tissue specific strategies of cell protection against induction of the apoptotic and necrotic processes.","403":"Endoscopic carpal tunnel syndrome surgery is a modern minimally invasive method of carpal tunnel decompression. However, the method does also have its critics, who emphasize that there is an increased rate of complications in comparison to open procedures. To further improve and optimize results of endoscopic surgery we used an intracarpal pressure sensor to verify the effect of carpal tunnel decompression. The endoscopic single portal approach was used in all cases. Median nerve conduction studies were performed prior to and 3 months after surgery. Two groups, those with pressure studies and those without, were then compared according to several EMG parameters such as: median nerve distal motor latency, amplitude of motor response, sensory nerve conduction velocity to the index finger, and amplitude of sensory nerve action potential. In both groups, we observed similarly significant improvements in all conduction parameters, except the amplitude of motor response, which did not change in either group, i.e. no difference in postoperative EMG between the two groups was observed. Despite this fact, intracarpal pressure measurement is still useful in localising the point in which the median nerve is compressed and provides valuable functional information on the level decompression achieved.","404":"CD163 is a member of scavenger receptor super family class B of the first subgroup. It is mapped to the region p13 on chromosome 12. Five different isoforms of CD163 have been described, which differ in the structure of their cytoplasmic domains and putative phosporylation sites. This scavenger receptor is selectively expressed on cells of monocytes and macrophages lineage exclusively. CD163 immunological function is essentially homeostatic. It also has other functions because participates in adhesion to endothelial cells, in tolerance induction and tissues regeneration. Other very important function of CD163 is the clearance of hemoglobin in its cell-free form and participation in anti-inflammation in its soluble form, exhibiting cytokine-like functions. We review the biological functions of CD163 which have been discovered until now. It seems apparent from this review that CD163 scavenger receptor can be used as biomarker in different diseases and as a valuable diagnostic parameter for prognosis of many diseases especially inflammatory disorders and sepsis.","405":"Innumerable descriptions about variations in the pattern of extensor tendons are recorded in the literature. The dorsum of the hand in an adult male cadaver revealed an unusual pattern of extensor arrangement during a gross anatomical practical session. The extensor digitorum, extensor indicis and extensor digiti minimi tendons displayed a variant pattern. Extensor digitorum contributed tendons only to the middle and ring fingers, with junctura tendinum present between the extensor digitorum for the ring finger and extensor digiti minimi. Interestingly, an accessory muscle was observed arising from the common extensor origin passing to the index finger, in addition to the usual extensor indicis. The origin and insertion of extensor digiti minimi was as usual with an accessory slip contributed from the extensor carpi ulnaris to the proximal phalanx of the fifth finger. The plethora of variations in this region is of paramount importance for the reconstructive surgeon, who may utilize the accessory tendons to restore functional capacity of the fingers.","406":"Radiotherapy has been used to treat loco-regional recurrences located at various intra-thoracic sites, but long-term survival of these patients has been rarely observed. We report herein a lung adenocarcinoma patient with locoregional recurrence, who was successfully treated with high-dose radiotherapy. The patient could survive with no evidence of recurrence 5 years after thoracic irradiation. It is probably safe to administrate high-dose radiotherapy for some loco-regional recurrent patients with favorable prognostic factors such as good PS, no body weight loss. Further studies will be required to define a favorable subset of patients most likely to benefit from an aggressive approach.","407":"Dural metastasis is a rare entity in clinical practice. We report a case of dural metastasis secondary to thyroid carcinoma, which on both preoperative CT and MRI and at surgery had the typical appearance of a meningioma. Histopathological findings confirmed metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma as a primary site. Although rare, dural metastases can mimic a meningioma. Our experience in this case has led us to consider metastasis as a differential diagnosis even when a meningioma is suspected. We believe that reporting of the case of dural metastasis mimicking a meningioma may help clinicians in future.","408":"We report on a serious side effect in a severely depressed 55-year-old woman, who presented an erythematous pigmented skin rash on the whole body under combination treatment with antidepressants, atypical antipsychotic drugs, the mood stabilizer lithium and the lipid-lowering drug pravastatin. The skin rash effect was most probably due, in first line, to olanzapine, but the cutaneous skin condition was triggered and aggravated by pravastatin, a 3-hydoxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A-(HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor, and lithium medication. The allergic reaction started to develop after co-administration of pravastatin. Therefore, the combination of atypical antipsychotics with statins should be carefully monitored and the benefits and disadvantages should be balanced.","409":"Goeckerman's therapy (GT) of psoriasis is based on daily application of pharmacy grade coal tar on affected skin with subsequent exposure to UV light. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of Goeckerman's therapy of psoriasis on the levels of proangiogenic chemokines ENA-78 (CXCL5, Epithelial Cell Derived Neutrophil Attractant-78), GRO alpha (CXCL1, Growth-Related Oncogene), IL-8 (CXCL8, Interleukin-8), MCP-1 (CCL2, Monocyte Chemotactic (Chemoattractant) Protein 1) and RANTES (CCL5, Regulated on Activation of Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted) in peripheral blood of 22 children's patients with psoriasis. 22 otherwise healthy children serve as a control group. The serum levels of chemokines were determined by commercial membrane protein array technique (RayBiotech, USA). Efficacy of Goeckerman's therapy was delineated by PASI score. Disease activity was significantly diminished by Goeckerman's therapy (p &lt; 0.001). Serum levels of GRO alpha and MCP-1 in patients before GT were significantly higher than those measured in healthy blood donors (GRO alpha: p = 0.0128 and MCP-1: p = 0.0003). Serum levels of GRO alpha, MCP-1 and RANTES were significantly diminished by GT (GRO alpha: p = 0.002, MCP-1: p = 0.048 and RANTES: p = 0.0131). Compared to the healthy controls, serum level of MCP-1 remained significantly increased in psoriasis patients after GT (p &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, we found that the GT of psoriasis influenced the serum levels of proinflammatory and proangiogenic chemokines, especially GRO alpha, MCP-1 and RANTES. It could be the cause for decreased proangiogenic activity which is described after GT of psoriasis.","410":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent leukemic disease of adults in the Western world. It is remarkable by an extraordinary heterogeneity of clinical course with overall survival ranging from several months to more than 15 years. Classical staging sytems by Rai and Binet, while readily available and useful for initial assessment of prognosis, are not able to determine individual patient's ongoing clinical course of CLL at the time of diagnosis, especially in early stages. Therefore, newer biological prognostic parameters are currently being clinically evaluated. Mutational status of variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgVH), cytogenetic aberrations, and both intracellular ZAP-70 and surface CD38 expression are recognized as parameters with established prognostic value. Molecules regulating the process of angiogenesis are also considered as promising markers. The purpose of this review is to summarize in detail the specific role of these prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","411":"Innumerable descriptions about variations in the pattern of extensor tendons are recorded in the literature.

The control group is divided into 2 subgroups according to smoking habit. Whitening with mild corrugation, frictional keratosis and frictional keratosis with mild or sever corrugation were the clinical findings. One hundred percent of clinical findings were present on buccal mucosa of chewing side of both smokers and non-smokers whatever the duration of khat chewing period. On the vestibular and mucobuccal fold mucosa, (100 % and 73.3 %) and (60 % and 43.7 %) of the khat chewers group had clinical findings on chewing side of smokers and non-smokers according to khat chewing duration respectively.

This complex body reaction involves also RANK\/RANKL molecules which have been recently identified as principal regulators of bone metabolism. To follow the changes in the expression of RANK\/RANKL molecules on innate immune cells of cardiac surgical patients. Twenty-six patients undergoing cardiac surgical were assigned to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting using either cardiopulmonary bypass (\"on-pump\") or modified \"miniinvasive on-pump\". The expression of RANK\/RANKL was performed by flow cytometry. Significantly increased expression of RANK on monocytes of \"miniinvasive on-pump\" patients was found at the 1st, the 3nd, and 7th postoperative days. The similar pattern was found also for monocyte RANKL expression. In addition, RANKL expression was significantly increased at the 3rd postoperative day in \"on-pump\" patient. No significant differences between \"miniinvasive on-pump\" and \"on-pump\" cardiac surgical patients were found. The expression of both RANK and RANKL molecules is significantly enhanced on monocytes of \"miniinvasive on-pump\" cardiac surgical patients.

The primary aim was to evaluate the diagnostic benefit of the procedure, the secondary aim was to assess the safety of RB and prevalence of clinical complications. The patients' mean age at the time of RB was 12.77 +\/- 4.17 years; range 1 to 19 years; male to female ratio 1.17:1. Haematuria was the most common indication for RB. All RBs were performed by a single consultant nephrologist. 27 biopsies in 27 patients (15.3 %) in 1997 were performed under X-ray control, the remaining 150 RB (84.7 %) under ultrasound guidance. The mean annual number of RBs performed in 1997-2001 was significantly higher than in the 2003-2008 period (21.6 +\/- 5.5 versus 9.9 +\/- 1.2; p=0.0003). All samples were diagnostic. The mean number of glomeruli was 23.5 +\/- 11.4 (range 4-55) per sample. The RB resulted in information yielding a definite diagnosis and\/or prognosis in 173 children (99.4 %). The most frequent diagnoses were IgA nephropathy (n=41; 23.5 %), mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (n=31; 17.8 %) and thin basement membrane glomerulopathy (n=22; 12.6 %). No major complications were encountered and only minor complications occurred in 43 cases (24.2 %), not requiring medical intervention. In conclusion, the present practice of RB in children is safe, with high clinical benefit.","422":null,"423":"Stem cells and their therapeutic use present many questions associated with ethical problems in medicine. There is great effort on the part of physicians to help millions of patients while there are ethical problems with the use of new methods and technologies and all of these are affected by economic and political influences. How will the current generation deal with these problems? Medicine, in this begard, is experiencing a stormy evolution of human culture in the relationships between disease, patient and doctor. Philosophy approaches the same juncture of human culture, but seemingly from the other side. Both disciplines are facing a great problem: How to unite the content of current human morality and the desire for health? Both philosophers and physicians perceive this deficit in human culture as it does not provide immediately usable normatives, which the living generation of healthy and ill is waiting for. It may be said that medicine, as many times before, has reached a stage where it cannot rely only on the proved axiologic values from the past, ethical normatives or cultivated moral sense of its subjects. Medicine has no other alternative than to take an active part in resolution of interdisciplinary problems originating from philosophic-biologic or philosophic-medical inquiries of axiologic, ethical, and moral issues. Our paper indicates some ways of the search in forming ethical principles of the stem-cell therapy from the view of biologists and physicians. New ways are recommended in theoretical-methodological interdisciplinary research, especially, in theoretical and experimental biology, and theoretical and clinical medicine, as well as philosophy. In this paper important ethical problems are pointed out in order to find answers to some key problems connected with cell therapy and the use of stem cells.","424":"The effect of unsubstituted deoxyhexoses, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and L-fucose, on tumor cells has been reported in several papers throughout the last decades. That of a similar deoxysugar, L-rhamnose, which is synthesized in bacteria and plants but not in animal cells, has until today not been explored. In the present study, we examined the effect of L-rhamnose on DNA and protein synthesis, growth and the potential induction of apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro. Using 2-DG for comparison, we studied the effect of L-rhamnose in concentrations up to 20 (32 resp.) mmol\/l on the initial velocity of the incorporation of labeled precursors of DNA and proteins in short term cultures of both mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) and human HL-60 cells in vitro, and further, on cell proliferation and apoptosis induction in HL-60 cells. Neither cytotoxic nor cytostatic effects of L-rhamnose were observed with the exception of slightly pronounced inhibition of DNA synthesis in EAT cells. From the lacking inhibition of the protein synthesis it can be considered that L-rhamnose does not interfere with energy metabolism, at least not in a similar manner as 2-DG.","425":"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. It is an immensely heterogeneous disease, characterised by a broad variety of clinical development. The research in recent years has focused on finding new markers of prognosis. This study investigates the role of expression of the bcl-2 protein in breast cancer. We analysed bcl-2 expression in 57 women with primary breast carcinoma who were treated with neoadjuvant (primary) chemotherapy, followed by a surgical procedure. The bcl-2 expression was correlated with other clinicopathological characteristics of the tumour- histological grade, stage, expression of hormonal receptors, proliferation rate, and with the survival of the patients. No significant association of bcl-2 expression with either overall survival or disease free survival was found.","426":"One of perspective approaches in treatment of hematological malignancies is activation of death receptors for TRAIL. However, leukemia cells studied to date have shown variable susceptibility to TRAIL. Our study demonstrates that cells of acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 are resistant to TRAIL and that ionizing radiation in the therapeutically achievable dose of 1 Gy sensitizes TRAIL-resistant cells MOLT-4 to the TRAIL-induced apoptosis by increase in death receptors for TRAIL DR5. When TRAIL is applied after the irradiation in the time of increased DR5 positivity more efficient cell killing is achieved.","427":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of cisplatin dose upon 3-year overall and disease-free survival rate of patients with advanced cervical cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin. Seventy-three patients with stage IIB-IVA cervical carcinoma were treated with pelvic (or pelvic + paraaortic) external-beam radiotherapy, high-dose rate brachytherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin of 40 mg\/m2 in the time period form January 2000 to December 2006 at our department. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free suvival rates were evaluated with regard to the number of cisplatin cycles applied during the external radiotherapy. Only twenty-eight patients received the intended five doses of chemotherapy. The most frequent cause of chemotherapy delay was the acute hematological toxicity with leukopenia. The 3-year overall survival was 71 % and the 3-year disease-free survival was 61 %. Survival analyses didn't prove a statistically significant influence of cisplatin dose upon 3-year survival in cervical carcinoma patients treated by exclusive chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin.","428":"","429":"Cardiac adverse effects of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone administration are well known, but there is little information about the cardiac side effects of oral methylprednisolone in the literature. We present a 41 year-old man with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in whom developed atrial fibrillation after oral methylprednisolone therapy.","430":"The authors present a case of thrombosis on the St. Jude Medical 19 aortic valve prosthesis. The diagnosis was confirmed by transthoracic and transoesofageal echocardiography, cardiac fluoroscopy revealed restricted movement of the aortic valve prosthesis leaflet. Thrombolytic therapy was complicated with brain embolism that was successfully percutaneously removed from the cerebral artery by the mechanical device. The patient has fully recovered without any neurological residual symptoms. This case report should be instructive to other clinicians who encounter the same complications after thrombolytic treatment.","431":"Zinc has been shown to have inhibitory effects on proliferation and metabolism of malignant colonocytes. Still, there is no information available concerning putative effects of zinc against motility and migration of colon cancer cells. Using fluorescence microscopy, immunoblotting and microflorimetry we show that treatment with zinc sulfate affected motility, invasiveness, cytoskeletal integrity and expression of selected markers (E-cadherin, catenin, vimentin, tubulin and actin) of invasive SW480 colon tumor cells. These results emphasize the possible multitudinous role of zinc in the process of colon cancer development and hint at the potential of this element in chemoprevention of advanced colorectal carcinoma.","432":"Excess intracellular zinc has been demonstrated to be responsible for cell injury and cell death in various experimental as well as clinical models. While the cells possess a system of mechanisms regulating intracellular zinc homeostasis, their saturation by acutely increased zinc levels or by a sustained exposure to elevated zinc levels results in liberation of free zinc stores within the cells and ultimate cell damage and cell death. Here we report that in Hep-2 malignant cells enhanced uptake of zinc causes activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling with resulting p53-dependent cell injury which can be significantly prevented by specific p53 inhibition and by prevention of oxidative stress. Our observations are consistent with the view that subacutely increased intracellular free zinc levels stimulate via oxidative stress p53-dependent pathways which are responsible for the final cell damage in tumor cells.","433":"Experiments presented here were aimed at the description of hematopoiesis repair and in vivo homing of transplanted separated CD117+B220- bone marrow cells after whole-body lethal irradiation at LD 9Gy. ROSA 26 mice were used as donors of marrow cells for transplantation [B6;129S\/Gt (ROSA)26Sor] and were tagged with lacZ gene, and F2 hybrid mice [B6129SF2\/J] were used as recipients of bone marrow transplanted cells. Hematopoiesis repair was provided by transplantation, both suspension of whole bone marrow cells (5x106) and isolated CD117+B220- cells (5x10(4)). Mice survived up to thirty days after irradiation. We demonstrated that transplantation of suspension of whole bone marrow cells led to faster recovery of CFU-GM (Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units) in bone marrow and in the spleen too. It is not clear what the share of residential and transplanted cells is in the repair process. Our results demonstrate that sufficient hematopoietic repair occurs after transplantation of CD117+B220- (lacZ+) in lethally irradiated mice, and the difference in CFU-GM numbers in the bone marrow and spleen found on day 8 posttransplant has no influence on the survival of lethally irradiated mice (30 days follow-up).","434":"This study was aimed at following the changes in the expression of CD38 ADP-ribosyl cyclase ectoenzyme on peripheral blood immune cells of patients undergoing cardiac surgical operations. The expression of CD38 on lymphoid and myeloid cells was determined by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry in forty cardiac surgical patients assigned to surgery either using (\"on-pump\", n=20) or without the use (\"off-pump\", n=20) of cardiopulmonary bypass. There was a very rapid upregulation of CD38 expression in \"on-pump\" patients, becoming significant at declamping of aorta (p&lt;0.01) for myeloid cells and at the weaning from CPB (p&lt;0.001) for lymphocytes. The increased expression of CD38 on lymphocytes in \"off-pump\" patients was prolonged for the entire observation period. However, significant differences in the expression of CD38 between \"on-pump\" and \"off-pump\" patients were not found either in lymphoid or myeloid cells. CD38 expression in immune cells of cardiac surgical patients is upregulated early during surgery, providing additional activation stimuli to the cell substrate of the inflammatory response induced by cardiac surgery. ","435":"Cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with some adverse postoperative complications caused by an altered immune response. An alternative approach to cardiac surgery, operating without the use of CPB (i.e. off-pump surgery), seems to display less adverse impacts on the immune response. Peripheral blood lymphocytes in 40 patients undergoing cardiac surgery either with CPB (\"on-pump\") or without CPB (\"off-pump\") were followed using flow cytometry. The samples of peripheral blood were taken at five intervals: preoperatively, after termination of the surgery, on the first, on the third and on the seventh postoperative day, respectively. The most substantial changes appeared on the first postoperative day in both subgroups of patients. While the percentage of both total T cells and CD4+ T cells were decreased, the percentage of HLA-DR+ activated lymphocytes was increased. These changes were more profound in the \"on-pump\" subgroup compared to the \"off-pump\" subgroup. Our results may suggest that the \"off-pump\" surgical approach reveals less adverse impact on adaptive immune responses. ","436":"While antidepressant prescription rules are established for approved indications by large-scale studies, off-label utilization naturally often lacks the validation by large scientific databases, and is at its best based on expert consensus. The aim of the present survey was to study the prescription habits of hospital psychiatrists with regard to antidepressants, comparing patients treated for depressions and anxiety disorder with patients receiving off-label antidepressant treatment. Data on drug use for this study were based on 6 reference days from April 1999 to November 2001 in the 98-bed psychiatric hospital of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. The drug prescriptions of 174 patients were assessed. Whereas the diagnosis did not influence the choice between newer or older antidepressants, patients presenting an anxiety disorder were 4.5 times more likely (p&lt;0.05) and patients with other diagnoses 8 times more likely (p&lt;0.001) to receive an antipsychotic comedication compared to patients whose primary diagnosis was a depressive disorder. Also, patients receiving concomitantly a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic were less likely to be prescribed an older antidepressant (p&lt;0.05). While patients with anxiety disorder and those with major depression received their antidepressants at comparable doses, patients with an off-label indication were treated preferentially with lower doses. The results of this survey suggest, that the prescribing hospital psychiatrists developed preferences with regard to the choice of the antidepressant class, which they then used for both registered and off-label indications. They then seemed to adapt the dose and the comedication according to the diagnosis, confirming the initial study hypothesis. ","437":"Two maxillary first molars and two central incisor typhodont teeth were prepared with 0.8 mm chamfer, 2.0 mm occlusal reduction, and 6 degree taper. The prepared teeth were duplicated 9 times to obtain 36 die stone models and divided into three groups (n = 12). Luting agents tested were zinc phosphate, glass ionomer and resin cement. Procera AllCeram 0.6 mm coping was fixed with a calibrated finger force of 50 N. The absolute marginal discrepancy was measured using the scanning electron microscope on four axial walls with 4 measurements on each wall to obtain a total of 16 readings for one tooth. Mann Whitney U test was applied to find significant differences between luting cements and Kruskal Wallis tests among groups. Results The absolute marginal discrepancies of cements were in reducing order zinc phosphate (AZ) 53 microm; resin (AR) 44.5 microm, glass ionomer (AG) 29 microm. There was a significant difference among luting cements AG V\/s AZ (p = 0.001) and AR V\/s AG (p = 0.003), except AR V\/s AZ (p = 0.213). All axial surfaces except mesial showed a significant difference. Conclusion The study concluded that different luting media have a definite effect over the final fit of AllCeram coping. Absolute marginal discrepancy was within the accepted level of 100 microm. Distal axial surface demonstrated a wider gap among all the luting agents.","438":"Biomechanical preparation alone does not completely eradicate microorganisms from the root canal, hence the next logical step is to perform root canal procedures in conjunction with antimicrobials. The use of an antimicrobial agent improves the efficacy and prognosis of endodontic treatment.

In the present case, we report the anomalous higher branching pattern of the femoral nerve on both sides of a 52 year male cadaver. The femoral nerve divided into the anterior and posterior branches above the inguinal ligament. Such a higher division of femoral nerve is a rare finding and it may be important for surgeons, orthopaedicians and anaesthetists in day to day clinical practice.","440":"The aim of the study is researching the incidence of group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) in upper respiratory tract infections in Turkey. This is a descriptive study. Totally, 3964 throat swabs obtained from patients with upper respiratory tract infections were cultured for isolation of GABHS in Corlu Military Hospital, Department of Microbiology, between April 2002 and April 2004. Standard microbiological techniques were used in the screening. In this study, GABHS were isolated from 230 (5.80%) of 3964 patients. The rate of isolation was 79 (5.65%)\/914 in 2002 year, 103 (5.55%)\/1857 in 2003 year, and 48 (6.77%)\/709 in 2004 year. The rate of isolation was 50 (5.47%)\/914 in the spring, 21 (3.21%)\/642 in the summer, 49 (5.81%)\/844 in the autumn, and 110 (7.03%)\/1564 in the winter. We found that the overall incidence of GABHS in respiratory tract infections (5.80%) was lower than other studies and the incidence was the highest in the winter. ","441":"Amperometric biosensor based on enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) was tested for pesticide methamidophos assay. Biosensor consists from four screen printed platinum electrodes on ceramic strip. AChE was physically adsorbed onto the electrode surface. The measuring principle was based on the inhibition of AChE activity in the presence of methamidophos. The proposed method limit of detection was 2.45 nM, responding to 3.46 pg of methamidophos detected absolutely when we consider the sample volume.","442":"TNF-alpha is a pleiotropic cytokine that is considered as a primary modifier of inflammatory and immune reaction in response to various inflammatory diseases and tumour. We investigated levels of TNF-alpha in 43 radicular cysts and 15 odontogenic keratocysts, obtained from patients undergoing surgery, under local anaesthesia, and after aspiration of cystic fluid from non-ruptured cysts. TNF-alpha is elevated in both cysts' fluid, but higher values were found in radicular cysts in comparison to keratocysts. The significantly higher concentration of TNF-alpha was associated with smaller radicular cysts, higher protein concentration, higher presence of inflammatory cells in peri cystic tissues, and the degree of vascularisation and cysts wall thickness (Mann-Whitney U-test, p &lt; 0.05). No correlation was found based on these parameters in odontogenic keratocyst, but all cysts have detectable concentrations of TNF-alpha. We here for the first time present that a difference in the concentration of TNF-alpha exists between these two cystic types.","443":"Due to immaturity of both specific and non-specific immune mechanisms, neonates are at risk of serious infections. The risk group definition is vague, clinical signs are non-specific and common laboratory markers are not as useful as in later ages, especially due to delayed reactions. In an attempt to find early, sensitive and specific markers, we assessed a defined set of surface leukocyte markers and humoral factors in cord blood. Several differences were noted--children in the risk group had a higher proportion of CD19+\/23+, CD16+\/64+, CD45RO cells and higher levels of IL-6. We find it promising that already at birth there are notable signs of reaction to infection and that a follow-up of a set of infectious markers could be useful to identify the children in need of antibiotic treatment and for diminishing unnecessary treatment.","444":"Hyaluronic acid (HA; synonyms--Hyaluronan, Hyaluronate) is a glycosaminoglycan found in the connective tissue of vertebrates. It is the most abundant glycosaminoglycan of higher molecular weight in the extracellular matrix of soft periodontal tissues. The use of HA in the treatment of inflammatory process is established in medical areas such as orthopedics, dermatology and ophthalmology. In the field of dentistry, it has shown anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial effects in gingivitis and periodontitis therapy. Due to its tissue healing properties, it could be used as an adjunct to mechanical therapy in the treatment of periodontitis.","445":"An illustrated case with Morton's metatarsalgia is presented. MR imaging was helpful for determining the presence, location and magnitude of intermetatarsal neuroma. Moreover, it had a large influence on the differential diagnostic thinking because many disorders may produce forefoot complaints mimicking Morton's metatarsalgia.","446":"Hydatid disease in both chambers of the heart is very rare. Mobile right atrial and right ventricular hydatid cysts were diagnosed incidentally in the etiologic work up for a transient ischemic attack in a 77-year-old man with a history of a hepatic hydatid cyst operation. Transthoracic echocardiography was very successful in the diagnosis of both hydatid cysts. Transesophagial echocardiography and computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis. Both right atrial and right ventricular hydatid cysts were removed under cardiopulmonary bypass to prevent morbidities and potentially fatal complications.","447":"Abductor pollicis longus (APL) muscle is known to exhibit different variations with respect to its attachments. Various studies have reported the splitting of the APL muscle. Comparative anatomical findings of split insertion of APL is commonly found in chimpanzees, gorillas and gibbons. In the present study, we describe an anomalous APL muscle, which originated from the posterior surface of the shaft of the radius and ulna and traversed a course deep to the extensor retinaculum. Interestingly, immediately after emerging form the deeper aspect of extensor retinaculum, the thin tendon of the APL muscle continued again as a muscular belly in relation to the dorsolateral part of the 1st metacarpal bone, to end as a tendon with its attachment to the base of the proximal phalanx. Such an unusual variation of APL with its attachment into proximal phalanx is a rare finding and may be of importance in altering the mechanics of the thumb during abduction. The clinical significance of such an anatomical variation of APL may be important during reconstructive surgeries involving thumb and also of academic interest.","448":"When checking tumour growth, a number of observations indicate that the immune system plays a significant role in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Infiltration by lymphocytes (tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, TILs) is more prevalent in RCC than any other tumours. T lymphocytes are the dominant population of TIL cells. Views concerning the role of T lymphocytic subpopulations, B lymphocytes and NK cells in an anti-tumour response are not established. The aim is to determine the phenotype and activation of T and B lymphocytic subpopulations and NK cells and to compare their representation in tumour stroma and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in patients with RCC. Samples of peripheral blood taken from the cubital and renal veins and tumour stroma cells were obtained from 44 patients in the course of their surgeries carried out due to primary RCC. TILs were isolated from mechanically disintegrated tumour tissue. Immunophenotype multiparametric analysis of PBL and TILs was carried out. Their surface and activation characteristics were determined by means of flow cytometer. CD3+ T lymphocytes (69.7%) were the main population of TILs. The number of CD3+\/CD8+ T lymphocytes was significantly higher in TILs, 42.6% (p &lt; 0.01), while CD4+ T lymphocytes were the majority population in peripheral blood, 41.35% (p &lt; 0.001). The representation of CD3+\/69+ T lymphocytes was significantly higher in TILs, 32.9%, compared to PBL (p &lt; 0.001). On the contrary, the numbers of CD3+\/CD25+, CD8+\/57+ and CD4+\/RA+ (naive CD4+ T lymphocytes) were higher in PBL (p &lt; 0.001). The differences in representation of (CD3-\/16+56+) NK cells and CD3+\/DR+ T cells in TILs and PBL were not significant. The above-mentioned results prove that the characteristics and intensity of anti-tumour responses are different in compared compartments (tumour\/PBL). CD3+\/CD8+ T lymphocytes are the dominant lymphocytic population of TILs. The knowledge of the phenotype and functions of effector cells, which are responsible for anti-tumour response, are the basic precondition for understanding the anti-tumour immune response and the cause of its failure. ","449":"Nerve agents and pesticides belong to the group of organophosphates. They are able to inhibit irreversibly the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Acetylcholinesterase reactivators were designed for the treatment of nerve agent intoxications. Their potency to reactivate pesticide-inhibited AChE was many times evaluated. In this study, five commonly used AChE reactivators (pralidoxime, methoxime, HI-6, obidoxime, trimedoxime) for the reactivation of AChE inhibited by two pesticides (chlorpyrifos and methylchlorpyrifos) were used. Russian VX (nerve agent) as a member of nerve agents' family was taken for comparison. Obtained results show that oximes developed against nerve agent intoxication are less effective for intoxication with organophosphorus pesticides. Especially, methylchlorpyrifos-inhibited AChE was found to be poorly reactivated by the compounds used.","450":"Human adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are rare elements living in various organs (e.g. bone marrow, skeletal muscle), with capability to differentiate in various cell types (e.g. chondrocytes, adipocytes and osteoblasts). In the year 2000, Gronthos and co-workers isolated stem cells from the human dental pulp (DPSCs). Later on, stem cells from exfoliated tooth were also obtained. The aims of our study were to establish protocol of DPSCs isolation and to cultivate DPSCs either from adult or exfoliated tooth, and to compare these cells with mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPCs) cultures. MPCs were isolated from the human bone marrow of proximal femur. DPSCs were isolated from deciduous and permanent teeth. Both cell types were cultivated under the same conditions in the media with 2% of FCS supplemented with PDGF and EGF growth factors. We have cultivated undifferentiated DPSCs for long time, over 60 population doublings in cultivation media designed for bone marrow MPCs. After reaching Hayflick's limit, they still have normal karyotype. Initial doubling time of our cultures was from 12 to 50 hours for first 40 population doublings, after reaching 50 population doublings, doubling time had increased to 60-90 hours. Regression analysis of uncumulated population doublings proved tight dependence of population doublings on passage number and slow decrease of proliferation potential. In comparison with bone marrow MPCs, DPSCs share similar biological characteristics and stem cell properties. The results of our experiments proved that the DPSCs and MPCs are highly proliferative, clonogenic cells that can be expanded beyond Hayflick's limit and remain cytogenetically stable. Moreover we have probably isolated two different populations of DPSCs. These DPSCs lines differed one from another in morphology. Because of their high proliferative and differentiation potential, DPSCs can become more attractive, easily accessible source of adult stem cells for therapeutic purposes.","451":"Myeloid cells are extensively activated in patients undergoing cardiosurgical operations. It is supposed that this activation is more profound in patients operated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (\"on-pump\") in comparison with patients operated without CPB (\"off-pump\"). To evaluate changes in the expression of a novel activation marker expressed on myeloid cells recognized by MEM-148 antibody. The expression of MEM-148 positive myeloid cells was evaluated by flow cytometry in 40 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) randomly assigned to \"on-pump\" or \"off-pump\" technique. The relative and absolute number of MEM-148 positive myeloid cells is significantly diminished during \"on-pump\" surgery. A significant increase in their number in postoperative period in both \"on-pump\" and \"off-pump\" patients was found. There were no significant differencies between \"on-pump\" and \"off-pump\" patients. The very trauma of surgery seems to be more relevant in starting on activation of myeloid cells them CPB itself. ","452":"Dental implants have been considered to be a successful treatment modality. Recently, achieving a good osseointegration is not the ultimate goal for the restorative dentist. Successful implant treatment demands the best gingival esthetic success along with stability and function of the implant. This study was performed to obtain answers to some controversial points pertaining to esthetics and function of implants in maxilla. Immediate flapless implantation into the extraction sockets in maxillary anterior zone is an emerging treatment option in dentistry--the esthetic success of which was in debate for long. The proposed study compared the esthetic success of immediate flapless implants (ILA), to immediate implants with the need for flap (ILB) and, delayed implants (DSL) in single tooth restorations, in the anterior region of the maxilla. The other aim of the study was to find out if any relation exists between the interproximal crestal bone height and papilla height. Analysis was done irrespective of treatment procedure in the same study group using periodontal sounding and radiographs to find out the relation. From the study involving 106 participants, including 21 ILA, 22 ILB and 63 DSL cases, we received highest papillary index score of 2.6 average from group ILA, followed by ILB and DSL, after 3 months of prosthetic loading. From the periodontal sounding and radiographic study it was evident that, when the distance between the base of the contact point of crowns and height of interproximal bone was less than 5, the papilla was present 100% of the time, but when the distance increased to 6 and more than 7 mm, the papilla was present only 46.5 and 24 percentage of the time respectively.","453":"The ventricular arrhythmias with underlying coronary artery disease are a leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD). While the SCD survivors with proven AMI are considered to be at low risk of SCD recurrence, those without the evidence of AMI represent a high risk group that benefits from implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Therefore, the evaluation of SCD survivors for the presence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a triggering factor of cardiac arrest is essential. In SCD survivors, the use of the standard diagnostic criteria of AMI may be difficult, as both serum cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiogram can be influenced by previous cardiac arrest. A novel technique that may be used for the diagnosis of AMI is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report its use in four patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation where the diagnosis of AMI could not be definitely established or excluded by means of other diagnostic procedures.","454":"The isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SF) has been reported to possess chemopreventive efficiency towards various malignancies including colon cancer. Here, we investigated the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of SF on colon cancer cell line SW620. We found that SF at concentrations of 10-50 microM inhibits cell viability and proliferation of SW620 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with IC50 being 26 microM (24 h), 24.4 microM (48 h) and 18 microM (72 h). Also, in the same cells SF caused DNA damage and chromatin condensation after 24 h and 48 h as revealed by phospho-H2A.X western blot analysis and DAPI staining of nuclei. These changes were accompanied by the elevated activity of caspase 3, although after 20 microM SF concentration only. Together, these results indicate that SF suppresses growth of human metastacic colonocytes and induces apoptotic cell death.","455":"Increased airway resistance can induce snoring and sleep apnea, and nasal obstruction is a common problem in snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Many snoring and OSA patients breathe via the mouth during sleep. Mouth breathing may contribute to increased collapsibility of the upper airways due to decreased contractile efficiency of the upper airway muscles as a result of mouth opening. Increased nasal airway resistance produces turbulent flow in the nasal cavity, induces oral breathing, promotes oscillation of the pharyngeal airway and can cause snoring.","456":"This article reviewed smoking related systemic diseases and oral diseases. Smoking is related to lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases and many other systemic diseases. Cigarette smoke affects the oral cavity first, so it is evident that smoking has many negative influences on oral cavity, for example, staining of teeth and dental restorations, wound healing, reduction of the ability to smell and taste, and development of oral diseases such as oral cancer, periodontitis, smoker's palate, smoker's melanosis, hairy tongue, leukoplakia, oral candidiasis and implant survival rate. The article also discusses the relationship between smoking and dental caries in detail.","457":"Bronchial artery aneurysm is a very rare condition. Its rupture can cause a life threatening hemorrhage. We report a case of a 50-year-old patient with a ruptured bronchial artery aneurysm who presented with epigastric pain. It is the first published case with such signs of a rupture of a bronchial artery aneurysm. CT scan confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with endovascular embolization.","458":"Primary cardiac angiosarcoma is a rare tumor, and surgical resection is often required to relieve its symptoms. A 54-year-old male with a large primary cardiac angiosarcoma is described in this case report. The tumor was located in the right atrium and right ventricle. The bulk was resected with the right coronary artery (RCA), and partial right atrium and partial right ventricle resections were performed during cardiopulmonary bypass. The resected tumor measured 15 x 10 x 8 cm, and the histopathological diagnosis was well differentiated primary cardiac angiosarcoma. In the postoperative period, the patient was followed up for 22 months, and radiotherapy and chemotherapy were performed for metastases. The optimal therapy for cardiac angiosarcoma is still controversial, but combined treatment including surgical resection should be considered.","459":null,"460":"The authors present a case of a 4-year-old girl with an orbital floor fracture. During surgery absorbable collagenous mesh (Pelvicol) was placed between the bone wall and the orbital periosteum. Pelvicol was selected as a natural xenogeneic tissue (porcine dermis) ready for first use in the reconstruction of the orbital floor fracture. The patient has fully recovered without any symptoms.","461":"The protective effect of the reversible cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and pyridostigmine alone or in combination with different drugs against acetylcholinesterase inhibition in the pontomedullar area and cerebellum of rats caused by VX agent (O-ethyl S-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methyl phosphonothiolate) in vivo (2xLD50) was studied along with survival of animals pretreated with different combinations of the drugs used. The best prophylactic effect was observed in a combination of pyridostigmine with benactyzine, trihexyphenidyle and HI-6. Tacrine alone or in other combinations has had no better prophylactic effect in comparison with these combinations containing pyridostigmine. Equine butyrylcholinesterase, also protected against VX poisoning very effectively.","462":"The neuroprotective effects of newly developed oximes (K156, K203) and currently available oximes (obidoxime, HI-6) in combination with atropine in rats poisoned with cyclosarin were studied. The cyclosarin-induced neurotoxicity was monitored using a functional observational battery 24 hours after cyclosarin challenge. The results indicate that a newly developed oxime K156 is able to counteract slightly cyclosarin-induced neurotoxicity while another newly developed oxime K203 is completely ineffective in reducing cyclosarin-induced neurotoxic signs and symptoms. The neuroprotective efficacy of K156 is comparable with commonly used obidoxime and oxime HI-6. Thus, none of the newly developed oximes achieves better neuroprotective efficacy than both commonly used oximes. They are therefore not suitable replacements for antidotal treatment of acute poisonings with cyclosarin.","463":"Lead is one of the oldest known and most widely studied occupational and environmental poison. Despite intensive study, there is still debate about the toxic effects of lead, both from low-level exposure in the general population owing to environmental pollution and historic use of lead in paint and plumbing and from exposure in the occupational setting. Significant position have organic lead compounds used more than 60 years as antiknock additives in gasoline. Chemical and toxicological characteristics of main tetraalkyl leads used as gasoline additives are discussed in this article. The majority of industries historically associated with high lead exposure have made dramatic advances in their control of occupational exposure. However, cases of unacceptably high exposure and even of frank lead poisoning are still seen, predominantly in the demolition and tank cleaning industries. Nevertheless, in most industries blood lead levels have declined below levels at which signs or symptoms are seen and the current focus of attention is on the subclinical effects of exposure. The significance of some of these effects for the overt health of the workers is often the subject of debate. Inevitably there is pressure to reduce lead exposure in the general population and in working environments, because current studies show that no level of lead exposure appears to be a 'safe' and even the current 'low' levels of exposure, especially in children, are associated with neurodevelopmental deficits.","464":"This article is limited to a review of bone replacement graft materials used in periodontal therapy. The source, mode of bone regeneration and the respective advantages and disadvantages of autogenous, allogenic, xenogenic and alloplastic materials are discussed.","465":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a novel technique used in the assessment of aortic stenosis. The aim of the study was to compare MRI and cardiac catheterization (CAT) that is still considered to be a \"golden standard\" in this indication. Thirty-four patients referred to CAT for the evaluation of aortic stenosis were enrolled into the study. CAT was performed according to the standardized protocol. Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution and mean aortic gradient was determined using simultaneous blood pressure measurement in aorta and left ventricle. MRI was performed within the period of 3 weeks after CAT. True FISP sequence with retrospective ECG gating was used for the imaging of the aortic valve orifice. Planimetry of the aortic valve area (AVA) was performed at the time of maximal opening of the valve during systole. MRI enabled the measurement of AVA in all patients enrolled. Mean AVA defined by CAT and MRI were 0,97 (+\/- 0,41) cm2 and 1,38 (+\/- 0,55) cm2, respectively. The correlation between the evaluated methods was statistically significant (p=0,003), but not very strong (r=0,43). The comparison of both methods in the identification of the severe aortic stenosis was characterized by kappa value of 0,331. Our study shows low agreement between cardiac catheterization and magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of aortic stenosis. However, MRI might have a role in the diagnostic algorithm in patients with suspected severe aortic stenosis and moderate mean aortic gradient or concomitant valvular insufficiency. ","466":"Apoptotic cell death is a highly regulated process, which plays a crucial role in many biological events. The aim of the present research was to investigate the expression of the apoptosis related genes BCL2 and BAX in Hep-2 and HL60 cells. Apoptosis was induced in these cell lines during treatment with etoposide. The expression levels of BCL2 and BAX genes were measured after 6 h and 12 h of treatment by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In Hep-2 cells the expression level of BCL2 significantly increased both 6 h and 12 h of treatment, whereas expression level of BAX didn't change. In HL-60 cells the expression level of BCL2 decreased after 6 h of treatment and expression of BAX increased both 6 h and 12 h of treatment with etoposide. Those findings show distinct reactions of Hep-2 and HL-60 cells to etoposide treatment and different upregulation or downregulation of apoptosis-related genes BCL2 and BAX.","467":"Tumour progression requires the presence of a rich vascular supply. A number of cytokines, chemokines and proteases participate in the process of tumour angiogenesis. We evaluated serum levels of angiogenin, panGRO (Growth Related Oncogene) (CXCL 1,2,3) and ENA-78 (Epithelial Neutrophil Activating) (CXCL5) in the serum of 32 patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) and 14 healthy blood donors by means of a protein array analysis. The patients were divided into three groups according to their disease stages (I+II, III, IV). We discovered significant differences between the blood donors and patients with RCC both in pre-operative and post-operative angiogenin, panGRO and ENA-78 levels. The increase in angiogenic factors lasted in patients even without metastases 2 months after surgery. We found no correlation between the levels of angiogenin and stages I+II, III and IV RCC. Patients with advanced carcinoma (stage III) had pre-operatively higher serum levels of ENA-78 than patients with stages I+II (p = 0,009) and IV (p&lt; 0.001). Eight weeks after surgery the patients with stages I+II had significantly higher levels of panGRO than patients with stage IV.","468":"The description of accessory phrenic nerve (APN) in the standard textbooks and available literature is vague and sometimes limited to few lines. The incidence of APN varies a great deal from 17.6 % to 80.9 % in the available literature. The aim of the present study was to calculate the incidence and variation of APN in Indian population. Forty five adult formalin-fixed cadavers (35 male, 10 female; 90 sides) used for gross anatomy dissection for undergraduates; during the 2 year period 2006-2007 were considered. Findings were recorded at different stages of the dissection. Out of 90 body sides studied, the APN was present in 48 sides (53.3 %). In 17 of the above sides the APN was confined to the cervical region (Cervical type) and in 31 sides the APN entered the thorax (Thoracic type), all anterior to the subclavian vein (SV). In eleven specimens the APN was found bilaterally. The incidence of APN, with its course and relation to the various structures in cervical and thoracic region will help the surgeons while performing internal thoracic artery (ITA) grafting and other radical neck surgery. ","469":"Our previous findings performed in rat tissues demonstrated that intermediate filament nestin is expressed in endothelial cells of newly formed blood vessels of developing organs and neural transplants. The aim of the present study was to identify other cellular markers expressed in nestin-positive (nestin+) blood vessels. To reach this goal we performed double immunofluorescent study to co-localize nestin with endothelium-specific markers (CD31, CD34 II, vimentin) or markers of perivascular cells (GFAP, SMA) in paraffin-embedded sections of normal human brain tissue, low- and high-grade gliomas, postinfarcted heart and samples of non-neural tumours. Our findings documented that all the samples examined contained blood vessels with different ratio of nestin+ endothelial cells. Double immunostaining provided unambiguous evidence that endothelial cells expressed nestin and allowed them to distinguish from other nestin+ elements (perivascular astrocytic endfeet, undifferentiated tumour cells, smooth muscle cells and pericytes). Nestin+ endothelium was not confined only to newly formed capillaries but was also observed in blood vessels of larger calibres, frequently in arterioles and venules. We conclude that nestin represents a reliable vascular marker that is expressed in endothelial cells. Elevation of nestin expression likely corresponds to reorganization of intermediate filament network in the cytoskeleton of endothelial cells in the course of their maturation or adaptation to changes in growing tissues.","470":"The major functions of granulosa cells (GCs) include the production of steroids, as well as a myriad of growth factors to interact with the oocyte during its development within the ovarian follicle. Also FSH stimulates GCs to convert androgens (coming from the thecal cells) to estradiol by aromatase. However, after ovulation the GCs produce progesterone that may maintain a potential pregnancy. Experiments with human GCs are mainly focused on the purification of GCs from ovarian follicular fluid followed by FACS analysis or short-term cultivation. The aim of our study was to cultivate GCs for a long period, to characterize their morphology and phenotype. Moreover, we have cultivated GCs under gonadotropin stimulation in order to simulate different pathological mechanisms during folliculogenesis (e.g. ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome). GCs were harvested from women undergoing in vitro fertilization. Complex oocyte-cumulus oophorus was dissociated by hyaluronidase. The best condition for transport of GCs was optimized as short transport in follicular fluid at 37 degrees C. GCs expansion medium consisted of DMEM\/F12, 2% FCS, ascorbic acid, dexamethasone, L-glutamine, gentamycine, penicillin, streptomycin and growth factors (EGF, bFGF). GCs transported in follicular fluid and cultivated in 2% FCS containing DMEM\/F12 medium supplemented with follicular fluid presented increased adhesion, proliferation, viability and decreased doubling time. Cell viability was 92% and mean cell doubling time was 52 hrs. We have optimized transport and cultivation protocols for long-term cultivation of GCs.","471":"The roots of surgery of the larynx reach into the 19th century. After the gaining of initial experiences, a period of radical surgery followed when most tumours were treated with a total laryngectomy. The middle of the 20th century can be characterised as a period of partial laryngectomies. The mutilation of patients caused by a total laryngectomy was and is one of the main impulses that led to the development of the current phase--combined treatment (radiotherapy, systematic cytostatic chemotherapy, biological treatment, surgery as an emergency treatment). The aim is to treat carcinoma of the larynx without the actual removal of the larynx itself and with the same oncological results as would be reached in cases treated with a total laryngectomy. Despite the development of non-surgical methods, surgery of carcinoma of the larynx remains a significant part of the treatment protocol. This work covers the development of surgery of carcinoma of the larynx from a historical point of view; it also describes current types of operations and discusses the position of surgery in today's treatment algorithm.","472":"There has been a paradigm shift from Black's 'extension for prevention' to a minimal intervention approach in the recent time. The most important aspect in diagnosis of earliest stages of enamel demineralization involves accurate and reliable detection of such lesions. The newer diagnostic aids would enable the dentist to detect and diagnose early enamel lesions and direct appropriate preventive measures to promote remineralization and conservation of the tooth substance. A high level of caries experience necessitates preventive strategies which are more cost effective than surgical intervention and restorative procedures.","473":"There has been a paradigm shift from Black's 'extension for prevention' to a minimal intervention approach in the recent time.

To date, the existence of cancer stem cells has been proven in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, in breast cancer, in brain tumors, in lung cancer and gastrointestinal tumors. This review is focusing on the recent discovery of stem cells in leukemia, human brain tumors and breast cancer. A small population of cells in the tumor (less than 1%) shows the potential to give rise to the tumor and its growth. These cells have a substantial characteristic of stem cells--ability for self-renewal without loss of proliferation capacity with each cell division. Furthermore they are immortal, rather resistant to treatment and express typical markers of stem cells. The origin of these resident cancer stem cells is not clear. Whether the cancer stem cells originate from normal stem cells in consequence of genetic and epigenetic changes and\/or redifferentiation from somatic tumor cells to the stem-like cells remains to be investigated. We propose the idea of the relation between normal tissue stem cells and cancer stem cells and their populations--progenitor cells. Based on this we highlight one of the major characteristic of stem cell--plasticity, which is equally important in the physiological regeneration process as well as carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we consider the microenvironment as a limiting factor for tumor genesis in AML, breast cancer and brain tumors. Thus the biological properties of cancer stem cells are just beginning to be revealed, the continuation of these studies should lead to the development of cancer stem cells target therapies for cancer treatment.","475":"Past studies of postural control during standing have employed wide range of procedures including the outcome measures use to quantify postural control, the duration of the sample collected, sampling frequency and methods for data processing. Due to these differences there remains little, if any, common grounds for comparisons between studies to establish a concrete understanding of the features and bouns which characterize normal healthy postural control. This article deals with terms such as reliability and repeatability of stabilometric measurements, stabilometric data quantification and analysis. To clear up those terms is suggested, by the author of this paper, very important. The stabilometric measurements remain, nevertheless, different when dealing with aging adults. Though, we notes some alterations of the aging systems, this article is not entirely dedicated to the seniors population. Measurements of COP and technical notes remain the main axis of present paper.","476":"Case report about laryngeal localization of a granular cell tumor in a 38 years old female without recurrence over an observation period of two years.","477":"Fasciola hepatica (FH) can lead to important hepatobiliary diseases. Here we present a case of hemobilia associated with biliary FH, which is quite a rare case. The 41-year-old patient, who underwent common bile duct exploration due to hemobilia, was found to have arterial bleeding associated with ulcer caused by a dead parasite in the common bile duct. Hemobilia is a very rare complication associated with FH. When searching for the cause of hemobilia, FH should be considered.","478":"First comparative analysis for some hemocoagulation reactions, immune state of acute myocardial infarction has been done in two groups of patients - with mycoplasma infections and without one. Postinfarction complications in the groups were observed. Atherosclerotic plaques of the patients were also studied on a presence of mycoplasmas and a content of strontium and zinc. A tendency to a mild pattern of acute myocardial infarction was observed in patients with mycoplasma infections. The role of mycoplasmas in atherogenesis and acute myocardial infarction is discussed.","479":"We investigated whether the addition of Gingko Biloba extract (EGb 761) to rabbit corneal epithelial medium before cell freezing improved cell viability after freezing then thawing. After removal of corneas, they were treated with enzymes and the corneal epithelium was prepared as a single cell suspension in freezing media with or without EGb 761. After freezing for two weeks then thawing, a higher cell viability was found in the cornea cell suspensions which had been frozen pretreated with EGb 761 in the media. The improvement with corneal cell viability with EGb 761 pretreatment is postulated to be based on the antioxidant capacity of the plant extract.","480":"Posture in a still stance has been quantified by changes in the center of pressure (COP), in both anterior-posterior (A\/P) and medial-lateral (M\/L) directions and measured on a single force platform (Bertec PRO VEC 5.0). The purpose of this study was to estimate the variance in error and the intrasession test-retest reliability, and to determine which measures shall be taken for further measurements, especially with adults age 65 and older. We used two types of approximation for the reliability coefficient. Firstly, we used the equation according to Blahus (2) and secondly we used the Pearson's correlation coefficient for test-retest measurements. The findings allow us to say, among other things, that the tests of quiet standing Double Narrow Stance Eyes Open (DNSEO) and Double Narrow Stance Eyes Closed (DNSEC) are parallel, in the sense of parallel testing.","481":"The effect of viewing a humorous film on salivary testosterone levels and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values on the back of the neck in 36 elderly healthy people (36 male, mean 70 years) and 36 elderly patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) (36 male, mean age 70 years) were studied. Salivary testosterone levels were decreased while TEWL values were increased in elderly patients with AD compared to those in elderly healthy people. Viewing a humorous film (The Best Bits of Mr. Bean, Universal studios, 1996) slightly, but significantly (P&lt;0.05), elevated salivary testosterone levels and reduced TEWL values in elderly healthy people, while viewing a control non-humorous film (weather information) failed to do so. Similarly, but more pronouncedly, viewing a humorous film markedly elevated salivary testosterone levels and reduced TEWL values in elderly patients with AD, while viewing a control non-humorous film failed to do so. These finding indicate that viewing a humorous film may be useful in the study of testosterone and TEWL, and treatment for dry skin in elderly people with or without AD.","482":"The aim of this study was to find the influence of blood withdrawals and diet iron on elective surgery. Male Wistar rats (n=24) were divided: 1. group (SLD) ate standard laboratory diet (SLD), 2. group (FE) an iron enriched diet (FE) with one blood withdrawal after 9 weeks. 3. group (SLD-w) SLD and 4. group (FE-w) ate the FE diet; with 9 withdrawals once a week. The rats were sacrificed 18 hour after partial hepatectomy (PH) in the 10th week. Liver DNA synthesis (3H-thymidin - kBq\/mg DNA) was performed. Serum hepcidin (pg\/ml), iron concentration, respiratory burst of polymorfonucleares (RB, spontaneous; stimulated, %), count of blood cells were determined. FE-w had a higher (2.36+\/-0.36) liver DNA synthesis after PH vs. SLD (1.21+\/-0.49). Higher hemoglobin in erythrocytes (pg) was in FE-w and SLD-w vs. FE and SLD. PMN count in SLD-w, FE-w increased vs. SLD, FE. Hepcidin after PH decreased in SLD (78.0), FE (68.0), FE-w (97.0), but increased in SLD-w (217). Serum iron increased in SLD-w. RB after PH increased in FE-w (4.5; 47.6) vs. SLD (1.15; 29.1), FE (3.20;17.8), SLD-w (3.30;13.7). The iron diet with stimulation of haematopoesis by withdrawals improves an organism's condition expressed as better response to elective surgery and better PMN functions. ","483":null,"484":"this retrospective study analyses the effect of selected psychosocial, demographics and health aspects on quality of life (QoL) in adult patients treated with peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT). The total number of respondents treated with PBPCT between the years 2001-2003 was 95. The return rate of QoL questionnaires was 72.1 % (71 respondents). There were 100 % ratable QoL questionnaire. The average age of all respondents was 55.5 years old. The Czech version of an international generic European Quality of Life Questionnaire - Version EQ-5D was used. The effect of selected aspects on QoL of patients was determined by analysis of variance. The QoL questionnaires were evaluated with descriptive analysis. The above-mentioned aspects proved statistically significant dependence of QoL (EQ-5D score - QoL dimensions, EQ-5D VAS - subjective health condition) on age, increasing number of associated diseases, religion and type of disease. The effect of other aspects on QoL was not proven statistically significant. The QoL in adult patients treated with PBPCT declines with increasing age and with the increasing number of associated diseases. People of faith have a higher level of QoL than non-believers. Patients with multiple myeloma treated with PBPCT have the most low QoL. The global QoL in an adult patients treated with PBPCT is on a good level. ","485":"CHOP chemotherapy has been used as a standard first-line treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma since the 1970s. Phase III trials have shown that the addition of rituximab (R) to CHOP chemotherapy leads to significant improvements in response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. This single-center, retrospective study was performed to evaluate the role of the addition of R to chemotherapy (CHT) in a real-world clinical setting. Outcomes were assessed in 85 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL treated with CHT alone (n=38) and R-CHT (n=47). Complete response (CR) rates were significantly higher after R-CHT than CHT (93 % vs. 73 %; p=0.02). The relapse rate was significantly higher after CHT compared with R-CHT (38 % versus 12 %; p=0.01). Progression-free survival was significantly extended by the addition of R (median not reached versus 26.1 months; p=0.04). These data bring further support for rituximab-based immunochemotherapy as a standard first-line therapy for patients with DLBCL.","486":"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), activated by oxidative stress, play a key role during cardiac remodeling. In the present study we aimed to assess the role of MMPs in experimental cardiomyopathy induced by repeated 10-week administration of daunorubicin (3 mg\/kg i.v.) to rabbits. In the daunorubicin group, the plasma cardiac troponin T levels (cTnT - a marker of myocardial necrosis) were significantly increased (p&lt;0.05), commencing with the 8th administration compared with the controls. The amount of collagen (an estimate of fibrosis) was also significantly higher in the daunorubicin group (13.39 +\/- 0.97 mg\/g wet weight) compared to the control group (10.03 +\/- 0.65 mg\/g wet weight). In both groups, the LV MMP-activity was observed only in the gelatine substrate in the 70 kDa region (MMP-2), while no MMPs activities were detectable either in the casein or collagen containing zymograms. At the end of the experiment, the MMP-2 activity was slightly up-regulated (by 16 %) compared with the controls.","487":"Current all-ceramic materials offer a accepted level of fracture resistance, fit and aesthetics. High fracture resistance recommends it to be a material to support fixed partial denture (FPD) in a stress bearing area with clinical success. This part of the present literature review covers the success rate, selection criteria of all ceramic systems, cementation technique, finishing and polishing. In vitro and in vivo studies of new high strength ceramics were well documented. Data suggest that single crowns in the anterior and posterior region are more predictable than bridges. Well-studied long-term success rate for FPDs are very limited.","488":"Over the past 35 years, multiple types of all-ceramic materials have been introduced as an ideal alternative for metal-fused to ceramic. This review covers state-of-the-art development of all-ceramic systems in terms of history, material composition, fabrication technologies, and structural and strength properties. These materials are proved to be ideal in terms of mechanical properties and biocompatibility, making metal-free ceramic restorations a realistic clinical alternative for conventional metal-fused-to ceramic.","489":"Cardiac surgical operations are associated with the development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In most cases, the inflammatory response is apparent only in its subclinical form. In some cases, however, it can become clinically manifest or even life-threatening.

The plasma NT-proBNP levels, chest x-ray, transthoracic 2-d and Doppler echocardiography were performed at the time of admission in a group of 96 consecutive patients (mean age 68 +\/- 11 years) with symptoms of acute heart failure. NT-proBNP levels were assessed with the use of commercial tests (Roche Diagnostics). All patients have significant increase in NT-proBNP (8000 +\/- 9000 pg\/mL vs. controls 90 +\/- 80 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.001). The group of all patients has shown a significant increase in cardiothoracic ratio (CTR, 0.6 +\/- 0.1, vs. 0.4 +\/- 0.1, p &lt; 0.001), left atrium diameter (LAD, 4.4 +\/- 0.8 cm, vs.3.5 +\/- 0.4 cm, p &lt; 0.01). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was decreased (37 +\/- 15%, vs. 64 +\/- 5%, p &lt; 0.001). In patients with acute heart failure, NT-proBNP significantly correlated with end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricle diameters, ejection fraction, vena cava inferior diameter and plasma creatinine levels. Increased plasma NT-proBNP level is influenced by the clinical severity of acute heart failure and correlates with LVEF and IVCD. NT-proBNP can serve as a marker for the clinical severity of the disease. ","492":"The mechanisms of cell injury resulting in a special type of cell death combining the features of apoptosis and necrosis were examined in Hep-2 cells exposed to 300 microM zinc sulfate during 24 h. Acute exposure to zinc induced a rapid rise in metallothionein levels and increased oxidative stress occurring in the absence of a significant early ATP depletion. Accentuated ATP loss and elevated levels of superoxide at later treatment intervals (12 h and longer) were present along with increased DNA damage. Manipulation with ATP production and inhibition of NADPH oxidase had a positive effect on zinc-related increase in oxidative stress and influenced the observed type of cell death. These results suggest that Hep-2 cells acutely exposed to zinc increase intracellular labile zinc stores and over express metalothioneins. Elevated production of peroxides in zinc-treated cells is at later treatment intervals accompanied by an increase in superoxide levels, possibly by activation of NADPH oxidase, DNA damage and severe ATP loss. Prevention of critical ATP depletion and, in particular, inhibition of oxidative stress attenuates zinc-mediated cell injury and stimulates apoptosis-like phenotype in exposed cells.","493":"We described three different conditions that induce differentiation of dissociated neural stem cells derived from mouse embryonic CNS. In the first set of experiments, where the cell differentiation was triggered by cell adhesion, removal of growth factors and serum-supplemented medium, only sporadic neuronal and astroglial cells survived longer than two weeks and the latter formed a monolayer. When differentiation was induced in serum-free medium supplemented with retinoic acid, rapid and massive cell death occurred. A prolonged survival was observed in cultivation medium supplemented with serum and growth factors EGF plus FGF-2. One third of the cells did not express cell differentiation markers and were responsible for an increase in cell numbers. The remaining cells differentiated and formed the astrocytic monolayer on which occasional neuronal cells grew. One third of the differentiated phenotypes were represented by cells of oligodendroglial lineage. Differentiation of oligodendroglial cells occurred in a stepwise mechanism because the culture contained all successive developmental stages, including oligodendrocyte progenitors, preoligodendrocytes and immature and mature oligodendrocytes. Maturing oligodendrocytes displayed immunocytochemical and morphological features characteristic of cells that undergo physiological development. The cultivation conditions that supported growth and differentiation of neural stem cells were optimal for in vitro developmental studies and the production of oligodendroglial cells.","494":"Inflammation has been recognized to form an integral part of the atherosclerotic process. Much consideration has been given lately to the role played in atherogenesis by C-reactive protein (CRP). Although not accepted unequivocally, CRP appears to be not only a marker, but also an active mediator of the atherosclerotic process. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a newly identified acute phase reactant which shares some structural and some functional properties with CRP. On the other hand, pentraxin 3 displays unique biological properties of its own, including a possible role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and in processes accompanying the natural evolution of surgical wounds. This review article discusses recent information concerning basic pentraxin 3 biology in inflammation and in innate immunity reactions as viewed by a cardiologist in the context of acute coronary events and by a surgeon in patients struck with multiple wounds who are at the same time menaced by bacterial infections.","495":"Cognitive deficit is considered to be a part of core dysfuncions in schizophrenia. It is associated with social impairment and influences the long-term course of the disorder. In addition to neuropsychological methods, event-related potentials can be used to study cognitive functions. In patients with schizophrenia an association was found between amplitude changes in slow negative component of evoked responses and infrequent deviations in a series of uniform stimuli. This amplitude change is known as \"mismatch negativity\" (MMN). It is supposed to be independent of the focused attention and effort that otherwise interfere with neuropsychological testing. Recently accumulated knowledge on MMN as a possible preattentive measure of cognition supports its potential significance for neuropsychological assessment. It may be helpful in more precise diagnosis and functional evaluation of schizophrenia.","496":"Inflammation is a protective immune response to infection, trauma, or injury; however, only a subset of patients develops inflammation, suggesting other contributing factors involved, such as the environment and genes. Inflammation-associated genes involving those with pro- and anti-inflammatory effect should be properly balanced and regulated; the protein products of these genes ultimately determine the outcome of inflammation. Apart from gene mutations, gene polymorphisms related to some inflammatory markers also appear to correlate with the incidence and\/or outcome of serious inflammatory events. Some genes recently recognized to be associated with inflammation are briefly reviewed. Modern genomic approaches, such as DNA micro-arrays and serial analysis of gene expression, allow for determining the extremely complex profile of inflammatory genes.","497":"Modern day endodontics is undergoing a massive change with the introduction of new molecular based techniques for microbial identification.

The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of neonatal hypoglycemia in LGA infants of non-diabetic mothers in a Community Maternity Hospital in Gaziantep, Turkey. Hospital records of 5229 infants of non-diabetic mothers were examined retrospectively. Newborns with birth weight more than 4000 g were defined as LGA. The control group consisted of 100 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) newborns. Capillary blood glucose was measured at the second hour of life. Glucose values lower than 40 mg\/dL (2.2 mmol\/L) were defined as hypoglycemia. Ninety-six (1.8%) of the 5229 infants were found to be LGA. The mean capillary glucose levels of the LGA newborns were significantly lower than those of the AGA newborns (54 mg\/dL (3.0 mmol\/L) vs. 95 mg\/dL (5.2 mmol\/L), p &lt; 0.0001). Neonatal hypoglycemia was established in 16 of 96 LGA infants (16.7%). In the control group hypoglycemia was absent. The rate of hypoglycemia in LGA infants was significantly higher than the rate in the AGA infants (p = 0.0000). As hypoglycemia is not rare in LGA infants and can have serious consequences, blood glucose levels should be screened routinely in LGA infants.","502":"In this work, in vitro potency of novel serie of monoquaternary pyridinium oximes to reactivate cyclosarin-inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was tested. Currently available oximes (pralidoxime, obidoxime, trimedoxime, HI-6 and BI-6) were used as oximes for comparison. As resulted, none of tested new reactivators was able to reactivate AChE inhibited by cyclosarin. Also pralidoxime, obidoxime and trimedoxime did not reach good reactivation results. Only oximes HI-6 and BI-6 achieved sufficient reactivation potency. From obtained results, it can be deduced, that only reactivators with oxime group in position two are able to reactivate cyclosarin-inhibited AChE.","503":"During shock, exposure of gut to ischemia determines patient's survival. Ischemic preconditioning (ISP) elevates nitric oxide and blood perfusion, whereby it protects organs against subsequent severe ischemia\/reperfusion. Using appropriate flow marker, microdialysis may serve to monitor interstitial microcirculation. Hence, our aim was to test the reliability of lithium as a flow marker (lithium microdialysis, LM) on an ISP model. Rats were divided into three groups. Two (ischemic and preconditioned) groups underwent 30 min celiac artery occlusion (CAO) with 2.5 h reperfusion. 25 min before CAO, the latter experienced 5 min ischemia. Sham-operated animals served as controls. LM in stomach and colon submucosa, serum nitric oxide, hepatic and pancreatic enzymes were measured. In stomach, LM indicated a decrease in blood perfusion evoked by CAO (p &lt; 0.01) in both experimental groups. During reperfusion, the ischemic animals showed a restoration of microcirculation, unlike the preconditioned ones, whose blood perfusion failed to regenerate (p &lt; 0.001). For any group, LM showed no microcirculation modification in colon. Serum analytes remained unchanged. We conclude that LM appears to be a potentially suitable indicator of gastrointestinal interstitial microcirculation. However, we failed to demonstrate any beneficial effect of ISP on pancreas, systemic nitric oxide and local\/remote microcirculation within studied organs.","504":"In literature, plagiocephaly is defined as abnormal asymmetrical head shape with unilateral flattening of the anterior and\/or posterior part of the skull. It is classified as synostotic or deformational. Synostotic plagiocephaly is the result of premature unilateral fusion of neurocranim sutures. Positional plagiocephaly is caused by asymmetrical intrauterine and\/or postnatal external forces. The authors report findings of both types of plagiocephaly in the dry skull collection from pertaining Broumov Ossuary (13th-18th century), Czech Republic. In the paper, the incidence of paleopathological asymmetrical skull deformities is discussed in the context with recent clinical data.","505":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach to the spastic hip subluxation and dislocation in children with cerebral palsy. We evaluated 56 hips in our consecutive patients who had been operated on at our department between January 2003 and December 2005. There were done soft-tissue release procedures in 42 hips, osseous reconstructive surgery in 11 hips and osseous palliative surgery in 3 hips. The duration of follow-ups was 1-3 years after surgery. We achieved good result in 15 hips after soft-tissue release, fifteen hips had a fair result, nine a poor result and three a failure. No redislocation was observed after osseous surgery in our patients. Two patients observed no pain after osseous palliative surgery, transient pain in the hip was in one case. In all hips the range of motion (abduction) was increased. The personal hygiene and possibilities of rehabilitation were improved. Childhood is the optimal time to intervene to maximize the function of the patient with cerebral palsy. The musculoskeletal treatment of the child prevents future problems with pain and deformity.","506":"The aim of the present study is to establish the results using the scores obtained from the methodology that was applied for assessing the stability after 2 years post orthodontic treatment and stability in a sample of 69 individuals. After applying PAR index to the collected group of patients, a series of scores were obtained, which were then needed to be evaluated further to establish the results. The scores were evaluated using the nomogram. A comparison was done between the post treatment and the 2 years post treatment PAR weighting scores to determine if the results were stable after orthodontic treatment. The majority of the orthodontic patients were treated to a good standard and that the results appeared to be stable.","507":"The evaluation of the treatment results is normally done to estimate the nature and quality of work, so that justice can be done to the work that we do and also that the patients will be satisfied. The primary motive of every orthodontist should be to treat the patient effectively and successfully with long lasting results. Thus the patients are to be assessed, using an appropriate method. PAR index was developed in the recent years to evaluate the treatment results and it is considered as a simple, objective and a reliable manner for evaluating the stability after orthodontic treatment. The index can be applied to different components of the dentition and scores are applied to each component after which the individual scores are multiplied with their respective weightings to balance the impact of the individual components of the overall result. They are then summed up to establish an overall total. In this manner, the method was carried out for the study casts of the three different phases of the treatment i.e. before the onset of the treatment, immediately after treatment and 2 years after treatment for assessing the stability after orthodontic treatment.","508":"Atopic eczema\/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS) is one of the most common chronic allergic diseases in children. Among the allergens found to be relevant in AEDS, aeroallergens and food allergens are the most important. The exposure of these patients to their relevant protein allergens can trigger an exacerbation or maintain the disease. AEDS is frequently associated with food allergy, which complicates the management in approximately 40% of these children. Atopy patch test (APT) can help in detecting food allergies in children with AEDS. The earliest publication on patch testing in eczema was described in 1937 by Rostenberg, but the first controlled clinical trial was provided by Mitchell in 1982. APT with food allergens were introduced into clinical use in 1996 by the group of Isolauri. APT test is performed epicutaneously with typical immediate-type allergens (aeroallergens or foods). As a number of apparently minor test modifications greatly influence the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the APT, the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (ETFAD) has developed a standardized APT technique. APT has developed into a valuable additional tool in the diagnostic work-up of food allergy in infants and children with atopic dermatitis.","509":"We investigated whether the addition of Gingko Biloba extract (EGb 761) to rabbit corneal epithelial medium before cell freezing improved cell viability after freezing then thawing. After removal of corneas, they were treated with enzymes and the corneal epithelium was prepared as a single cell suspension in freezing media with or without EGb 761. After freezing for two weeks then thawing, a higher cell viability was found in the cornea cell suspensions which had been frozen pretreated with EGb 761 in the media. The improvement with corneal cell viability with EGb 761 pretreatment is postulated to be based on the antioxidant capacity of the plant extract.","510":null,"511":"An illustrated case with Morton's metatarsalgia is presented. MR imaging was helpful for determining the presence, location and magnitude of intermetatarsal neuroma. Moreover, it had a large influence on the differential diagnostic thinking because many disorders may produce forefoot complaints mimicking Morton's metatarsalgia.","512":"Abductor pollicis longus (APL) muscle is known to exhibit different variations with respect to its attachments. Various studies have reported the splitting of the APL muscle. Comparative anatomical findings of split insertion of APL is commonly found in chimpanzees, gorillas and gibbons. In the present study, we describe an anomalous APL muscle, which originated from the posterior surface of the shaft of the radius and ulna and traversed a course deep to the extensor retinaculum. Interestingly, immediately after emerging form the deeper aspect of extensor retinaculum, the thin tendon of the APL muscle continued again as a muscular belly in relation to the dorsolateral part of the 1st metacarpal bone, to end as a tendon with its attachment to the base of the proximal phalanx. Such an unusual variation of APL with its attachment into proximal phalanx is a rare finding and may be of importance in altering the mechanics of the thumb during abduction. The clinical significance of such an anatomical variation of APL may be important during reconstructive surgeries involving thumb and also of academic interest.","513":"Myeloid cells are extensively activated in patients undergoing cardiosurgical operations. It is supposed that this activation is more profound in patients operated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (\"on-pump\") in comparison with patients operated without CPB (\"off-pump\"). To evaluate changes in the expression of a novel activation marker expressed on myeloid cells recognized by MEM-148 antibody. The expression of MEM-148 positive myeloid cells was evaluated by flow cytometry in 40 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) randomly assigned to \"on-pump\" or \"off-pump\" technique. The relative and absolute number of MEM-148 positive myeloid cells is significantly diminished during \"on-pump\" surgery. A significant increase in their number in postoperative period in both \"on-pump\" and \"off-pump\" patients was found. There were no significant differencies between \"on-pump\" and \"off-pump\" patients. The very trauma of surgery seems to be more relevant in starting on activation of myeloid cells them CPB itself. ","514":null,"515":"Successful treatment of iron overload by phlebotomies has been reported in two splenectomized siblings with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia--type II (CDA-II). In both patients 400 ml of blood were withdrawn every month. During three years 12 200 ml of blood were removed. The serum ferritin levels decreased from 1450,4 microg\/L and 1131,7 microg\/L to 447 microg\/L and 457 microg\/l, respectively. The transferrin saturation dropped from 0,99 at the start of the therapy to 0,64 and 0,86, respectively. The values of Hb, Hct, erythrocyte counts and MCV did not change as well as did not change reticulocyte counts, reticulocyte index, and RDW. Both patients tolerated repeated phlebotomies well. The decrease of bilirubin and normal values of haptoglobin might be the concequence of diminished destruction of erythrocytes and their precursors. Our observation confirms that phlebotomies can be used with success in CDA patients with mild anemia as treatment modality of iron overload.","516":"The cytotoxic potentials of the lipiodol emulsion with dissolved 131I-docetaxel, the 131I-lipiodol emulsion and non-labeled docetaxel were tested on the HeLa Hep2 cell line during 24 hours. The pilot study confirmed that the radio-labeled docetaxel was significantly more toxic than the radionuclide or docetaxel alone.","517":"Mortality associated with acute renal failure (ARF) remains high despite of developments in therapy strategies and definition of different prognostic factors. Therefore, this study focused on to define new prognostic factors and especially regional characteristics of the ARF patients. One hundred fifteen ARF patients, diagnosed from November 1998 to May 2003, were included to this prospective and observational study. Clinical features, laboratory parameters, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III scores and co-morbid conditions of the patients were examined. Clinical and laboratory data, and APACHE III scores were recorded at the first nephrology consult day. Thirty of the patients (26%) died. APACHE III scores, presence and the total number of co-morbid conditions and serum albumin levels at the time of first nephrology consultation were found as independent predictors of mortality. There was a negative correlation between APACHE III scores and serum albumin levels. Not only increased APACHE III score and presence of co-morbid conditions but also low serum albumin level was found as the predictors of mortality. However, only serum albumin level is seen as modifiable prognostic factor among these parameters. Therefore, further studies are necessary to determine the causes of hypoalbuminemia in patients with ARF and the effect of it's effective treatment on patients outcome.","518":"The purpose of the study was a retrospective evaluation of the outcome of surgical therapy of lung cancer in patients where there was concomitant cardiac disease and who underwent a cardiac operation either because of ischemic heart disease or because of valvular disease. These patients were operated on at various time intervals (two to ten months) after their cardiac operation. Some patients had their lung cancer surgery after the cardiac operation because of the high risk of possible cardiac postoperative complications; in one patient the lung operation preceded the cardiac one.","519":"Acute toxicity has been evaluated in head and neck cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB-IMRT). The basis of the treatment protocol is an irradiation in 30 fractions with a total dose: 66 Gy to the region of macroscopic tumor, 60 Gy to the region of high-risk subclinical disease and 54 Gy to the region of low-risk subclinical disease. Between December 2003 and September 2005, 38 patients with carcinoma of different locations in the head and neck region were irradiated. Five patients underwent concurrent chemotherapy (weekly cisplatin). Acute toxicity was evaluated according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity scale for skin, mucous membrane, salivary glands, pharynx and esophagus and larynx. All 38 patients completed the therapy without urgency of interruption due to acute toxicity of radiotherapy. No patient experienced grade 4 toxicity. More severe toxicity was observed in patients with concurrent chemotherapy. The results confirm that the irradiation according to our SIB-IMRT protocol is a therapy with acceptable toxicity and there is a space for radiobiological enhancement of this regimen by concurrent chemotherapy, e.g. weekly cisplatin.","520":"Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is worldwide the sixth most common female cancer, and this malignancy carries the highest mortality among all gynecological cancers. The high mortality is due mostly to the fact that the tumor is frequently diagnosed late, in advanced stage, as the early disease is often asymptomatic and no effective screening methods are available. The most important prognostic factors in ovarian carcinoma are the stage, size of residual tumor following surgery, presence of ascites, age and the general condition of the patient, tumor histology, and, in patients with early disease, also the grade of the tumor. Large number of studies on prognostic and predictive factors in epithelial ovarian carcinoma has been published, often with contradictory results. The most intensely studied prognostic factors are those for expression of hormonal receptors, for tumor proliferation activity (mainly by antigen Ki-67 and topoisomerase IIalpha), the markers of apoptosis (p53, p21, mdm2, bcl-2 and other proteins), or other oncoproteins (particularly HER-2\/neu).","521":"","522":"We present three cases of pneumopericardium following blunt chest trauma injury. All three patients were victims of road traffic accidents. All had multiple associated injuries and pneumopericardium was found as the additional finding. Pneumopericardium was treated conservatively with thoracic drains placement and patients observation. Transesophageal echocardiography was used as a method of choice for exclusion of cardiac air tamponade. All three patients survived.","523":"Dynamic morphology and cytoskeletal changes in Hep-2 cells exhibiting features of non-apoptotic cell death after treatment with zinc were studied using immunofluorescence microscopy and spectrofluorimetry. Among early morphological changes in treated cells was development of vacuolization, surface blebbing, relatively rapid cell detachment from substratum, cell shrinkage and, in some cases, appearance of membrane protrusions. Staining of microfilaments revealed rapid rearrangement and subsequent loss of F-actin accompanied by changes in the amount and localization of G-actin. The use of specific kinase and caspase inhibitors did not prevent surface blebbing as well as other morphological features in dying cells. Dying cells were only weakly positive for phosphatidyl serine and showed only a transient activation of caspase-9 with no signs of activation of caspase-3. These results suggest the existence of nonapoptotic cell death showing morphological features of both apoptosis and necrosis but, biochemically, resembling some other type of cell death.","524":"We carried out a retrospective analysis on a series of 1743 plasma donors during the period from January 1999 to February 2004 to determine the frequency of monoclonal gammopathies occurrence. In the whole group, we observed 0.68% occurence and in the subgroup of donors over 40 years of age even 1.18% occurrence of the serum paraprotein. We have presented our recommendations for the screening of monoclonal gammopathies in blood donors.","525":"In the past, scientists focused on the development of antidotes (mainly anticholinergics in combination with reactivators of inhibited acetylcholinesterase-oximes) to increase the number of surviving nerve agent-intoxicated individuals. Recently, they are interested in antidotes able not only to protect nerve agent-poisoned men from lethal toxic effects but also to improve their life quality by improvement of their central cognitive functions. In our study, the water maze was used to measure spatial working learning and memory in the case of tabun-induced cognitive impairment in albino Wistar rats. Antidotal treatment consisted of atropine alone or a combination of atropine with an oxime (obidoxime, trimedoxime or oxime HI-6). Our results suggest that atropine alone is not sufficient as a treatment for saving cognitive functions impaired by tabun. On the other hand, the addition of oxime to atropine contributes to improvement of cognitive performance in tabun-poisoned rats regardless of type of oxime.","526":"Idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH) is defined as hypercalciuria that persists after correction of dietary inbalances and has no detectable cause. The excretion of urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (U-NAG), a marker of proximal tubular damage, has been previously reported as either increased or normal in children with IH. We evaluated U-NAG in 20 children (13 boys and 7 girls, mean age 10.3 years +\/- 5.7 SD) with IH (urinary calcium excretion above 0.1 mmol\/kg\/24 hours, with no detectable cause) and with otherwise normal renal function tests. Ultrasound examination revealed urolithiasis (n=4) and nephrocalcinosis (n=1). The U-NAG values were evaluated in the spot urine collected from the second morning void and calculated as the urinary NAG\/creatinine ratio (U-NAG\/Cr) and expressed in nkat\/mmol. The 24-hour urinary calcium excretion (U-Ca\/24h) was assessed in a urinary sample from 24-hour collected urine and calculated in mmol\/kg. The obtained results of U-Ca\/24h and U-NAG\/Cr were expressed as Z-scores. When compared to the reference data, the U-Ca\/24h and U-NAG\/Cr were significantly higher (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.006, respectively). There was no correlation between the U-NAG\/Cr and U-Ca\/24h (r = 0.18, p = 0.20). The U-NAG\/Cr values were significantly higher in the 5 patients with urolithiasis\/nephrocalcinosis, whether compared to the rest of the group (p = 0.02), or to the reference data (p = 0.01). The U-NAG\/Cr activity was higher in 15 children without urolithiasis\/nephrocalcinosis when compared to reference data (p &lt; 0.01). There was no difference in U-Ca\/24h between the children with and without urolithiasis\/nephrocalcinosis (p = 0.58). These findings suggest that tubular impairment, as reflected by U-NAG\/Cr, might occur in children with IH, especially in patients with urolithiasis\/nephrocalcinosis. There doesn't seem to be a direct relationship between the U-NAG\/Cr activity and the degree of calcium leakage.","527":"The aim of this study was to assess the results of 5-year experience with minimally invasive operation without medial incision and resection cartilages for correction of pectum excavatum. From 2000 we made in our Hospital minimally invasive technique for the correction of pectus excavatum. 75 patients were treated by minimally invasive technique. A convex steel bar is inserted under the sternumtrough small bilateral Incisions. The steel bar is inserted with the convexity facing posteriorly, and when it is in position, the bar is turned over. After 2 years the bar is removed when permanent remolding has occurred. Initial excelent results were maintained in 54 patients (normal chest), good results in 16 (mild residual pectus) and poor in 5 (severe recurrence requiring further treatment). The mean follow-up since surgery were 3 months to 3 years. Average blood loss was 25 ml. Average length of hospital stay was 8 days. Patients returned to full activity after 2 month. Complications were pneumothorax in 12 patients, pneumonia in 6 patients and displacement of the steel barr requiring revision in 2 patients. Poor results occurred because steel bar was too soft in 3 patients, and soft sternum in 2 patients with Marfan's syndrome. The minimally invesive technique is effective without cartilage incision and resection or sternal osteotomy.","528":"Activity of Serum Adenosine Deaminase (ADA), a main enzyme in purine degradation and considered as a marker for non-specific T cell activation, in psoriasis has been investigated in a few studies with conflicting results. To evaluate the significance of serum ADA activity in psoriasis, and analyze whether ADA activity may be related to disease activity, we performed a prospective study with 38 cases of psoriasis and 24 healthy volunteers. Patients were divided into two groups as cases with local and stable lesions (Group i, n: 20) and severe cases with extensive involvement (Group ii, n: 18). Serum ADA activity was determined by modified Guisti procedure. When taken into consideration of all patients--regardless of the severity of the disease--the mean serum ADA activity of psoriatics did not differ significantly from that of controls (p &gt; 0.05). However, it was higher in Group ii than in Group i and healthy controls (respectively p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05). A significant decrease was observed also after therapy only in Group ii (p &lt; 0.001). Serum ADA activity may be correlated to the disease activity of severe psoriasis. We suggest that it might be a serologic marker for follow-up of in such cases. It could be used in predicting relapses before clinical findings as well as in deciding to stop or decrease systemic therapies at the right time, which have potential to cause severe systemic side effects when given for a long period. Further studies with larger case populations are required to support our findings. ","529":null,"530":"Root resorption is an undesirable sequela of orthodontic tooth movement. The odontoclasts are responsible for root resorption and the process of hyalinization is known to preceed the orthodontic root resorption. It is found that there are several predisposing factors, therefore an evaluation of these factors should be done by careful examination of personal medical history, severity of malocclusion and dental treatment (if any due to previous history of trauma), anterior crossbite etc. The evaluation becomes an essential factor as it helps the orthodontists in detecting the occurance and severity of the root resorption and thereby plan out the treatment more effectively. Orthodontic tooth movements especially intrusion and other movements like tipping, torque are all known to influence the root resorption, therefore the detection using radiographs and repair of root resorption is of utmost significance as root resorption is a more serious problem from a medicolegal stand point of view. However some studies have shown that the repair process is known to occur after the cessation of orthodontic treatment by the deposition of cementum of cellular type. In the light of orthodontist's liability of what is basically an unpredictable phenomenon, it is necessary that the speciality define this uncertainity and protect its members against unnecessary and unjustified litigation.","531":"Sinus lift operations have become a prerequisite for implantologists in the rehabilitation of atrophic posterior maxilla. Alloplasts and xenografts are the recent innovation in the world of grafting materials and have evolved in such a way as to compensate the need for autografts to be used in conjunction. In order to perfect the grafting materials, histomorphometry is the most often tool used to study the success of the augmentation. This article has tried to commemorate the importance of histomorphometry in maxillary antroplasty and also the success rate of beta-tricalciumphosphate and deproteinized bovine bone as an augmentation material in maxillary augmentation.","532":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that attacks mainly young people. It leads to the progressive deterioration of the neurological status. Histopatologically, this disease is characterized by appearance of multiple foci of the demyelination in white matter of the CNS, with various grade of an axonal loss. The current treatment is targeted on moderating the inflammatory process and symptomatic therapy. In spite of all this therapy, the course of the disease often progresses. The tissue of the CNS in mammalians, including humans, is able to provide some degree of spontaneous remyelination. Unfortunatelly the extent of this process is not sufficient for the complete restoration. The support of remyelination by using the cell manipulations is the aim of many experimental studies. Theoretically, it is possible to achieve remyelination either by exogenous induction of remyelination from endogenous sources (precursor cells) or by the real transplantation of myelin-forming cells intrafocally, intracerebroventricularly or into the blood stream. In this work, we present the brief view on the recent state of this topic. We present the list of the cell types, useable for cell transplantations and the summary of the growth factors influencing the behaviour of the oligodendroglial precursors. We are considering the hampers in usage of the cell therapy of demyelinating disorders in clinics.","533":"The case of a 56 years old man is presented, who developed acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis 5 days after the introduction of olanzapine 10 mg. Multiple 1-mm pustules appeared on the whole body, concentrated especially on her neck and face. Within 2 days, the eruption was increasingly accompanied by erythema and pruritus. No fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias or myalgias were recorded. The diagnosis was corroborated by hystopathology. After 7 days of treatment, olanzapine and valproate were stopped. Concomitantly, cetirizine 20 mg p.o. and methylprednisolone 500 mg i.v. were given once. During the following week betamethasone cream was applied, and the pustular eruption resolved completely.","534":"We reviewed the cases of three patients with an unstable grade-III slipped capital femoral epiphysis treated between 2001 and 2003. Clinical records and imaging studies were reviewed for patient's history, anatomic features of the slip, definitive treatment and clinical outcome. The duration of the follow-up ranged from twenty-four to fourty-eight months.","535":"Although fistulae resulting from superficial parotidectomy represent a serious problem, there is still little consensus on the optimal treatment. Some suggest management by applying dressings, while others advise surgery. In recent years several other strategies have been proposed. In this manuscript, we present two cases of postparotidectomy fistulae treated by injection with fibrin tissue glue (Tissucol Duo 500, Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria). Furthermore, a review of the literature is presented. In both patients the fistulae completely healed within months without complications. A literature search revealed that this is the first time postparotidectomy fistulae were treated this way. We conclude that postparotidectomy fistulae can be effectively treated with fibrin glue. Moreover, this treatment is simple, safe and has no side effects.","536":"D-galactosamine (GalN) is a highly selective hepatotoxin that causes liver damage similar to human viral hepatitis via depletion of uridine nucleotides, which subsequently diminishes synthesis of RNA and proteins. Model of galactosamine hepatotoxicity is frequently used in animal experiments in vitro. The purpose of our study was to establish the model of GalN-induced hepatocyte injury in in vitro conditions using primocultures of rat hepatocytes as an important pre-requisite for further experiments in which we would like to study potential hepatoprotective effect of various substances. Rate of hepatocyte injury was evaluated by morphological changes, changes in cell viability, albumin production, mitochondrial membrane potential, activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases and glutathione content. Marked dose dependent hepatocyte injury was found after 24-hour incubation with GalN. Based on the results we suggest as an optimal model for short-term toxicity test exposure to GalN for 24 hours in dose of 40 mM.","537":"Clinical manifestations and prognosis of sarcoidosis are heterogenous and the prevalence varies depending on the country, area and race evaluated. Also the organs involved and courses of the disease differ greatly between countries, areas, races and individuals. To investigate the sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentation and symptoms and to determine the severity and prognosis of sarcoidosis in Turkey as a referral center. Between January and July 2003 we retrospectively evaluated the outcome of the patients with sarcoidosis whose first clinical visits were between 1965 and 2003 in the multidisciplinary referral setting RS at Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty of the University of Istanbul. Data collected about each patient included sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentation, symptoms, date of diagnosis, date and age of onset, method and stage of disease at the date of diagnosis and at the date of last evaluation; the mortality and survival rate were calculated. One hundred and sixty six consecutive patients whose first clinical visits were between 1965 and 2003 in the multidisciplinary RS at Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty were enrolled. We contacted every patient in our cohort by telephone calls or home visits. All those contacted were called back to outpatient clinic for a formal evaluation between June and September 2003. A formal physical examination and thorax radiography were performed in patients who came to the hospital. Their radiological stage, signs, symptoms and associated extrapulmonary manifestations were recorded. At the initial presentation, the mean age of diagnosis was 40.3 years. The 31-40 age group is the group with the highest number of patients. Coughing was the most frequent symptom and erythema nodosum was the most frequent sign in both sexes. Thirty eight percent of patients had extrathoracic involvement. The most frequent extrapulmonary site of involvement was skin. The mortality rate was 11.6% (10.8% in females and 13% in males). Comorbidity was 3% (5 females, 1 male). Females, youngs and patients without extrathoracic involvement had higher survival rates. Clinical characteristics, course and prognosis of sarcoidosis vary in different studies. The results may vary accordingly to ethnic, geographic, social and economic conditions. ","538":"Thromboembolic complications are described in about 1% of the patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA). The aim of this study was to analyze thrombotic complications after RFA and to determine prothrombotic states in patients with thrombotic complications. We analyzed data from 400 patients (212 females) who underwent 453 RFA procedures for supraventricular tachycardias. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed one day before and after RFA in all patients. We evaluated the clinical and laboratory (in patients with thrombotic complications after RFA) risk factors of thromboembolism. We observed thrombotic complication in 7 (1.75%) patients (6 females), thrice flail thrombus in the right atrium, flail thrombus in the inferior vena cava, femoral vein thrombosis with massive pulmonary embolism, femoral vein mural thrombus and upper extremity digital arteries embolization; four of them were asymptomatic. As a prothrombotic state we identified factor V Leiden mutation in one case and the use of oral contraceptives in two cases. Two other patients had a positive history of thromboembolic events. In a subgroup of females the use of oral contraceptives (p = 0.13) or a positive history of thromboembolism (p = 0.21) were not identified as important risk factors. Echocardiographic detection of asymptomatic thrombotic complications contributed to the higher percentage of these complications in our study. Although we can identify the risk factor (laboratory or clinical) in a majority of patients with a thromboembolic complication, occurrence of these complications is unpredictable. ","539":"The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence, clinical impact and importance of different risk factors of transmission of TTV infection in Slovakia using two PCR methods. Sera of 426 adult persons were examined. TTV DNA was identified by PCR using primers from N22 and untranslated region (UTR) respectively. The established prevalence of TTV tested with N22 and UTR primers according to patients groups was: acute hepatitis of unknown etiology 4 resp. 28 of 37, acute hepatitis B 3 resp. 29 of 38, chronic hepatitis B 11 resp. 41 of 44, chronic hepatitis C 10 resp. 93 of 102, hemodialysis patients 13 resp. 72 of 72, health care workers 0 resp. 27 of 33, control group 8 resp. 83 of 100. Using N22 primers, TTV infection occurred more frequently in chronic hepatitis B group compared with health care workers, if UTR primers were used the group of hemodialysis patients differed significantly from both acute hepatitis groups, health care workers and controls (p &lt; 0.05). From possible risk factors hemodialysis and transfusion count showed notable differences. Bilirubin and aminotransferase levels did not differ between TTV positive and negative groups. No pathogenetic role of TT virus in liver injury was confirmed.","540":"The purpose of our study was to determine the amount of glycated proteins and advanced glycation end products (AGE) in cataractous lens homogenates of patients who underwent phacoemulsification, and to define a simple in vitro protein model of glycoxidation. Analysis of 30 cataractous lenses (15 diabetic and 15 non-diabetic) revealed a significant increase in both glycated lens proteins of diabetics compared with the controls (0.15 vs 0.08 nmol\/mg protein, P &lt; 0.01) and AGE-linked fluorescence at 440 nm (4.8 vs 2.8 AU\/mg protein, P &lt; 0.01). The presence of AGE fluorescence in lenses indicates the role of oxidative stress in cataractogenesis. Fifty-six days incubation of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, used as model proteins, with 500 mM D-fructose at 25 and 37 degrees C led to a complete inhibition of ALT and AST activities. The fluorescence of both aminotransferases rose according to the chosen incubation temperature: 37 degrees C &gt; 25 degrees C &gt; 4 degrees C. ALT and AST incubated in a medium containing D-fructose are subject to nonenzymatic glycation followed by a consequent formation of AGE products. Our data: i) support the concept of glycation-glycoxidation pathway appearing in diabetic patients; ii) form a base for determination of the efficiency of various antioxidative compounds in vitro.","541":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are rare elements living in various organs (e.g., bone marrow), able to differentiate into specialized tissues, such as bone, cartilage, tendon, and myocardium. Since the first description of MSCs by Fridenshtein, several investigators have shown that these cells can also differentiate into chondrocytes, adipocytes, and, at least, in rodents into skeletal myoblasts. Later on, more primitive progenitor cells were characterized, able to give rise not only to limb-bud mesoderm, but also to cells of visceral mesoderm. Those cells were named mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs). The aim of our study was to characterize and compare the biological properties and spontaneous differentiation potential of two different cell types (MSCs and MPCs) isolated from the human vertebral body bone marrow. The results of our experiments proved that the MPCs can be expanded beyond Hayflick's limit and differed from MSCs in morphology, biological and phenotypic characteristics. Because of their high proliferative and differentiation potential, MPCs can become more attractive source of adult stem cells for therapeutic purposes.","542":"The objective of this work was to review nutritional components of the Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean diet is not a specific diet plan or diet program but a collection of eating habits that are traditionally followed by the people of the Mediterranean region. There are at least 16 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and food habits vary between these countries according to culture, ethnic background and religion. The Mediterranean diet, containing olive oil, fish, fruits and vegetable is associated with a low rate of cardivascular and cancer diseases. This diet is rich in phytosterols, squalene, dietary fibre, antioxidants, phenolic substances and polyunsaturated acids.","543":"Aesthetics in implantology is a topic currently attracting lot of attention from dental implantologists all over the world. It includes both white and red aesthetics with much greater importance been given to the red aesthetics. In this article, both hard tissue and soft tissue procedures and techniques, used in the development of implant recipient sites will be presented and discussed, briefly outlining the treatment planning and also various dental materials used in enhancing aesthetics in implant restorative procedures.","544":"Programmed cell death, apoptosis, plays an integral role in a variety of biological events, e.g. morphogenesis, removal of unwanted or harmful cells, tissue homeostasis etc. Members of the Bcl-2 family have been described as the key players in the regulation of the apoptotic process. This family consists of proteins that prevent apoptosis (Bcl-2-like) and two structurally distinct subgroups (Bax-like and BH3-only) that on the contrary promote cell death. Majority of their response is concentrated to the mitochondrial level. In this paper, besides reviewing some new information in this field we focused on how they interact among each other and on the way they sense and influence the death signals from the environment. Here, we compare Bcl-2 family to inspectors and superintendents since they supervise the manufacturing process of cell death and they determine whether the cell will die or it will resist and survive.","545":"There is a spectrum of several threat agents, ranging from nerve agents and mustard agents to natural substances, such as biotoxins and new, synthetic, bioactive molecules produced by the chemical industry, to the classical biological warfare agents. The new, emerging threat agents are biotoxins produced by animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Many types of organisms produce substances that are toxic to humans. Examples of such biotoxins are botulinum toxin, tetanus toxin, and ricin. Several bioactive molecules produced by the pharmaceutical industry can be even more toxic than are the classical chemical warfare agents. Such new agents, like the biotoxins and bioregulators, often are called mid-spectrum agents. The threat to humans from agents developed by modern chemical synthesis and by genetic engineering also must be considered, since such agents may be more toxic or more effective in causing death or incapacitation than classical warfare agents. By developing effective medical protection and treatment against the most likely chemical and mid-spectrum threat agents, the effects of such agents in a war scenario or following a terrorist attack can be reduced. Toxin-mediated diseases have made humans ill for millennia. Unfortunately, the use of biological agents as weapons of terror has now been realized, and separating naturally occurring disease from bioterroristic events has become an important public health goal. The key to timely identification of such attacks relies on education of primary care physicians, first responders, and public health officials.","546":"Fulminant hepatitis is a rare complication of acute hepatitis A infection. Nevertheless, the seroepidemiology of the infection is rapidly changing with the developing world, rendering more adults susceptible to the infection, in particular with more severe course. We report here fulminant hepatitis A infection with a mortal course during an epidemic period in two siblings. Although it causes a self-limited mild disease, hepatitis A virus may have a severe course including fulminant hepatitis and may lead to mortality, especially in older ages. Hence, the risk of hepatitis A virus infection and its complications should be reduced with measures of immunization and sanitation.","547":"The aim of our study was to describe histopathology of the peripheral nerve after its circular release followed by embedding in different environs. We operated on 18 male rats divided into 3 groups. In the first group right femoral nerve was surgically released. In the second group the nerve was enveloped by the subcutaneous fat flap. In the third one the nerve was wrapped up by the skeletal muscle. Six weeks later the animals were killed by exsanguination. The femoral nerve, in the first group, did not show any pathological changes. In the second group 3 animals appeared normal or nearly normal, nevertheless in 3 of them perineural fibrosis and axonal degeneration were observed. Histological reaction in the third group disclosed dispersed axonal injury. Our experiments using rat model imitate situation in humans. The results obtained will help us in making meaningful decision when performing peripheral nerve injury.","548":"Even though exciting progresses have been until now, further studies are necessary to clearly understand the significance of MMC. Mast cells are thought to participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. However, their role in the pathogenesis remains unsettled. The specific aims of this study were to (1) examine mucosal mast cell counts in the cecum in patient with IBS, and IBD (2) compare MMC between the disease groups. We showed increased MMC count in IBS.","549":"To define peculiarities of urinary magnesium (Mg) excretion in diabetic adolecents; to elucidate gender-related differences in Mg urinary excretion; to determine urinary Mg excretion differences between diabetic and age-matched healthy children. The diurnal, nocturnal and 24-h urinary Mg level in adolescent boys and girls (aged 13-17 years) with type I diabetes mellitus (DM) and in age-matched control groups of healthy boys and girls was examined. Additionally the adolescent girls were examined during different phases of their menstrual cycle. Diurnal, overnight and 24-h Mg urinary excretion in diabetic adolescent boys and girls was significantly higher than in healthy ones. In diabetic boys 24 h Mg excretion was higher than in diabetic girls (4.59 +\/- 1.4 vs. 3.34 +\/- 1.5 mmol; p &lt; 0.05). The investigation showed gender-related differences in Mg urinary excretion in healthy adolescents: 24-h Mg urinary excretion was significantly higher in boys than in girls (2.66 +\/- 0.9 vs. 2.1 +\/- 0.9 mmol; p &lt; 0.05). The level of Mg in the nocturnal urine of boys and girls was significantly higher than in diurnal. Urine Mg was negatively related to height in adolescent girls. Diabetic adolescents excrete significantly more Mg with urine as compared to healthy ones. ","550":"The intracoronary administration of autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs) has been shown to improve the left ventricle function in the course of acute myocardial infarction. Therefore we have started a clinical trial using transplantation of BMCs in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. The aim of our study is to assess the feasibility and safety of this procedure, and effect on the left ventricle function of these patients. We describe the first experience in two patients with acute myocardial infarction reperfused using direct stenting. The aspiration of bone marrow from the sternum provided sufficient amount of the cells for transplantation. No serious ischemia and no changes in coronary artery patency were detected after intracoronary infusion. The left ventricle ejection fraction was increasing throughout the time of three-month follow-up. No other complications (ventricular arrhythmias, reinfarction, thrombus formation) were detected.","551":"The effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, acetylsalicylate and metamizol, on spinal monosynaptic reflexes were investigated in spinalized and normal rats. Adult rats (n=36) weighing 150-200 g were anesthetized with ketamine and artificially ventilated. Half of rats were spinalized at C1 level. A laminectomy was performed in the lumbosacral region. Following electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve by single pulses, reflex potentials were recorded from the ipsilateral L5 ventral root. Acetylsalicylate was administered orally (100 mg\/kg for both spinalized and normal rats). Metamizol was administered intramuscularly (15 mg\/kg for both spinalized and normal rats). These drug administrations significantly decreased the amplitude of reflex response in all groups (p &lt; 0.05). These data verify that observed inhibition by acetylsalicylicate and metamizol may be at the level of spinal cord. Also we suggested that the cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid may play an important role in regulating the reflex potential.","552":"Tertiary N-haloethylamines are able to cyclize to the corresponding aziridinium ions. The inhibitory activity of the DSP-4 (N-(o-brombenzyl)-N-ethyl-2-chlorethylamine) and its two derivatives OS-21 (N-benzyl-N-ethyl-2-chloroethylamine) and OS-23 (N-fenylethyl-N-ethyl-2-chloroethylamine) was studied toward rat brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in vitro. The influence of the THA (tacrine; 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine) on AChE inhibition by these substances was also evaluated. The results demonstrated that all of three aziridinium compounds formed in solution caused a time- and concentration-dependent irreversible enzyme inhibition. The association of aziridinium compounds with the AChE was a relatively slow second-order reaction. DSP-4 showed the fastest rate of AChE alkylation, OS-21 had a lowered rate and OS-23 displayed the lowest rate. Pretreatment of the enzyme by THA decreased the rate of alkylation by all three aziridinium compounds by allosteric mechanism.","553":"Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are located in Disse spaces of normal rat liver. In their quiescent state they serve as a storage site for vitamin A. In fibrotic liver they become activated, proliferate and they undergo transdifferentiation into myofibroblast-like cells. Changes in the cell phenotype are accompanied by changes in the cellular cytoskeleton. We have studied the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and intermediate filament proteins vimentin, desmin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by immunocytochemistry in HSC cultured for 2 or 7 days after isolation. Normal or cirrhotic rat liver was perfused with solutions of pronase and collagenase and HSC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation of the resulting cell suspension. Liver cirrhosis was produced in rats by repeated carbon tetrachloride administration. Vimentin was detected in all cells from normal and cirrhotic liver. The concentration of desmin in the cells from cirrhotic liver was slightly higher than that in normal cells and it increased with time in culture. GFAP could be detected only in normal cells 2 days after their isolation. In contrast, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) was absent from normal cells at this time but its expression was pronouced later. In most cells from cirrhotic liver this antigen was already present on the second day of culture and its expression further increased.","554":"Iron is an essential element involved in many life-necessary processes. Interestingly, in mammals there is no active excretion mechanism for iron. Therefore iron kinetics has to be meticulously regulated. The most important step for regulation of iron kinetics is absorption. The absorption takes place in small intestine and it is implicated that it requires several proteins. Iron is then released from enterocytes into the circulation and delivered to the cells. Iron movement inside the cell is only partially elucidated and its traffic to mitochondia is not known. Surprisingly, the regulation of various proteins related to iron kinetics and energy metabolism at the molecular level is better described. On contrary, the complex control of iron absorption cannot be fully explicated with present knowledge.","555":"","556":"The very large patient (weight 142 kg, height 197 cm, body surface 2.76 m2) was referred to acute operation with dissecting type A ascending aortic aneurysm. The calculated blood flow was 6.63 l\/min. To anticipate potential difficulties with perfusion and oxygenation two oxygenators connected in parallel were incorporated into the circuit. Bentall procedure with ACB to the RCA was performed. The perfusion was uneventful. Bypass time was 259 minutes, cross clamp time 141 minutes, circulatory arrest 7 minutes. The highest oxygenators gas flow was 2.6 l\/min with maximum FiO2 0.42. The use of two in parallel connected oxygenators is a very effective, easy and safe method in such extreme perfusions, offering to the perfusionist a great reserve of oxygenator output.","557":"A 22-year-old man presented with fever and ulceration of the oral mucosa. The patient had pharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. For the 3 weeks prior to presentation, he had been taking approximately 1000 mg\/day of flowering herbs (Hypericum perforatum L, known as St. John's wort) for treatment of depression. A complete blood count on the first day of hospitalization showed agranulocytosis and normocytic anemia. His condition worsened, and he developed progressive dysphagia. A bone marrow biopsy on day 3 revealed bone marrow necrosis. After the diagnosis was established (day 3 of hospitalization), treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 48 U\/day, intravenous immunoglobulin 400 mg\/kg, and amphotericin B 100 mg\/day was initiated. The patient did not respond, and died within one week of the diagnosis. This cases suggests that Hypericum species may lead to severe hematologic toxicity, with conditions involving bone marrow necrosis.","558":"(1) The influence of the time of administration of antidotal treatment consisting of anticholinergic drug (atropine) and newly developed oxime (K027 or K048) on its effectiveness to eliminate tabun-induced lethal toxic effects was studied in mice. (2) The therapeutic efficacy of antidotal treatment of tabun-induced acute poisoning depends on the time of its administration regardless of the choice of the oxime. (3) Our results show that both oximes studied (K027, K048) are able to sufficiently eliminate lethal effects of tabun. Nevertheless, their efficacy significantly decreases when they were administered 5 min after tabun poisoning. (4) The findings support the hypothesis that both newly developed oximes appear to be suitable oximes to counteract acute toxicity of tabun although their ability to eliminate lethal toxic effects of tabun significantly decreases with prolonged time interval between tabun challenge and antidotal treatment administration.","559":null,"560":"The kidney function can be assessed by a number of methods. The urinary excretion of enzymes, in particular N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), is considered a relatively simple, cheap, fast and non-invasive method in the detection and follow-up of renal tubular function under various conditions. The determination of urinary NAG provides a very sensitive and reliable indicator of renal damage, such as injury or dysfunction due to diabetes mellitus, nephrotic syndrome, inflammation, vesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract infection, hypercalciuria, urolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, perinatal asphyxia, hypoxia, hypertension, heavy metals poisoning, treatment with aminoglycosides, valproate, or other nephrotoxic drugs. This paper gives an overview of the current use of urinary NAG in the detection of renal injury.","561":"Endothelins are potent predominantly vasoconstricting agents that act as local autocrine and paracrine mediators. Endothelin-1 is the most potent and sustained vasoconstrictor and pressor substance yet identified. Abnormalities of the endothelin system occur in a range of diseases associated with vasoconstriction, vasospasm, and vascular hypertrophy. ET receptor antagonists were until recently regarded as drugs of great promise in patients with congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and others. The aim of this article is a survey of compounds that affect the endothelin receptors and clinical trials with these agents.","562":"Patient satisfaction, an indicator of the quality of care provided by emergency department (ED) personnel, is a significant issue for EDs. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with patient satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and to describe demographic characteristics of those surveyed in a university hospital ED. All adult patients who consecutively presented to the ED between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays were included in the study. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire prior to discharge. The questionnaire asked about the attitude, politeness, and efficiency of the medical and ancillary staff, the reason for preferring our centre and reasons for dissatisfaction. Two-hundred and forty-five adult patients presenting to our ED were included in this study. Forty-five percent of patients preferred our ED because of the previous perception of higher quality of care, informed by other people previously treated in this ED unit, and 35% because of restrictions by their health insurance carrier. The main causes of patient dissatisfaction were lengthy waiting times (27%). As a result, lengthy waiting time was the major reason for patient dissatisfaction, and high quality care together with insurance restrictions were the main reasons for preference of this university hospital ED. ","563":"Angiogenesis plays a major role in the development and progression of haematological malignancies. In our study we measured plasma concentrations of key angiogenic activators vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) using comercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 37 patients with lymphoid malignancies and 20 healthy donors. We found a statistically significant increase in bFGF concentrations in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL, n=18) compared to the control group (median 118.8 vs. 9.3 pg\/ml, p&lt;0.001). However, we didn't find any significant difference in VEGF concentrations between B-CLL patients and the control group. There was also no significant increase in bFGF or VEGF in patients with multiple myeloma (n=7) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=12). Our pilot study shows that measurement of angiogenic activators in plasma is a feasible and reproducible method of angiogenesis assessment. Larger studies are needed for correlation between serum and plasma concentrations and detailed statistical evaluation including the impact on patients' survival.","564":"The article presents an unique case of trans-sexual person (FtM) with histological finding of pre-invasive cervical carcinoma after performed hysterectomy.","565":"The authors present a rare and unusual case of complication, migration of osteosynthetic material for stabilization, titanium rod, which was used for stabilization of comminutive fracture of the first lumbar vertebra. This rod migrated from the retroperitoneal space to the pleural cavity. The removal of this rod was carried out by videothoracoscopy.","566":"Papillary cystic neoplasm is a rare tumor and is usually found in young female patients. Here we describe a rare case of PCN in 16 year old girl, which was presented with abdominal pain in last 3 years. Preoperative diagnosis was suggested by ECHO and CT of the abdomen. The sonographic examination of the abdomen showed a tumor measuring 6.5 x 5.5cm in diameter in epigastrium. It was excised totally. Histological description confirmed the diagnosis of PCN. The patient is currently in good health without signs of relapse 3 years after surgery. Our patient is one of the very few adolescent patients with PCN who was treated successfully with surgery. ECHO and CT of the abdomen suggested the diagnosis which was confirmed by histopatological examination. The diagnosis of PCN is suspected by ECHO and CT of the abdomen and confirmed by specific histologic features. Prognosis is good and tumor should be excised whenever detected. ","567":"Extraintestinal manifestations are common complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) whereas the association of cardiac disease with IBD is rarely reported. Cardiac manifestations may be diagnosed before, concomitantly or after the diagnosis of the specific type of inflammatory bowel disease. Pericarditis and myocarditis are potentially serious complications. This extraintestinal manifestation developed in one patient concomitantly with onset of intestinal disease. One patient had ulcerative colitis (UC), while other had Crohn's disease (CD). Indomethacin was effective in one and the other patient required prednisone in addition. Chest symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease should be evaluated to exclude myopericardial disease.","568":"It is believed that total goiter prevalence in Turkey is as high as 30.5%. The iodine deficiency is the distinct etiologic factor in the development of goiter. The aim of this study was to determine goiter prevalence and iodine deficiency in adults living in Erzurum (1659 m above sea level) for at least 10 year. The study involved 340 people (192 females, 148 males). The median age was 38.5 year (ranging from 20 to 76 years). Ultrasound-measured thyroid volume (TV) for men (TV&gt;25 ml) and for women (TV&gt;18 ml) was considered goiter indicator. By this evaluation, goiter was diagnosed in 94 (27.6 %) cases, whereas the goiter prevalence, based on the palpation method, was 5.6%. Urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was measured by ammonium persulfate method. UIC in subjects with goiter was significantly lower than that of the others (median values 5.0 vs 7.8 microg\/dl, p&lt;0.0001). While the value of UIC &gt; or = 10 microg\/dl (no. 121, 36.6%) was accepted normal, the extent of iodine deficiency in other subjects was classified as severe (UIC&lt;2.0 microg\/dl, no.53, 15.6%), moderate (UIC=2.0-4.9 microg\/dl, no.75, 22%) and mild (UIC=5.0-9.9 microg\/dl, no.91, 26.8%). TV values were found to be significantly different among the four groups (p&lt;0.05). TV values were significantly correlated with body surface area and UIC (r=0.15 and r=-0.16, respectively, p&lt;0.005). Also, the prevalence of thyroid nodules was estimated as 2.1% by palpation and 18% by ultrasonography. We conclude that goiter originating from iodine deficiency has been an important health problem in Erzurum. Besides taking measures at national level, local factors and risks which interfere with the nationwide efforts should also be dealt with for the eradication of the iodine deficiency problem. In the region, periodical evaluation of iodine level and iodine related disorders will guide the measures to be taken for the well being of people's general health.","569":"Increased oxidative stress might play an important role in the initiation and progression of diabetic complications. The present study has been undertaken to investigate whether there is any relationship between retinopathy degree and leukocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in diabetic individuals with type 2 diabetic retinopathy. Patients were groupped with respect to the degree of retinopathy. Leukocyte malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and SOD and CAT activities were measured in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=41) and nondiabetic healthy controls (n=23). Leukocyte LPO of the type 2 diabetic patients with retinopathy was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001), whereas SOD and CAT activities were decreased (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) compared to those of controls. MDA concentrations rose while SOD and CAT activities fell with increasing severity of diabetic retinopathy, altough there was no significant difference in comprasion of the parameters mentioned above between the diabetic patients with and without retinopathy. Our results show that leukocytes in patients with type 2 diabetic retinopathy are affected by oxidative stress which might be contribute to pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Prospective studies are needed to evaulate the relationship between the leukocyte antioxidants status and DR.","570":"The dynamics of cell morphology, in particular membrane blebbing, was studied after induction of apoptosis by etoposide or camptothecin in four human stabilized cell lines (Hep2, Bowes, HT-29 and HL-60). Time lapse videomicroscopy and F-actin staining revealed various dynamic parameters of this process including its duration, maximal extent, stages and final endpoints in individual cells. Although generally occurring in predictable patterns, our results indicate a relatively significant variability both in appearance and temporal organization of blebbing not only between different cell lines but also within them.","571":"Botulism is a potentially lethal disease caused by one of seven homologous neurotoxic proteins usually produced by the bacterium, Clostridium botulinum. This neuromuscular disorder occurs through an exquisite series of molecular events, ultimately ending with the arrest of acetylcholine release and hence, flaccid paralysis. There are three types of botulism: food, wound, and infant botulism. Most strains of the bacterium produce a potent, respiratory muscle-paralyzing neurotoxin, botulinum toxin (BTX). It can lead to death unless appropriate therapy is promptly initiated. Due to the severity and potency of BTX, its importance as a biological weapon is of major concern to public health officials. Nevertheless, BTX is also medicament.","572":"OP\/nerve agents are still considered as important chemicals acting on living organisms and widely used in human practice. Nerve agents are the most lethal chemical warfare agents. They are characterized according to their action as compounds influencing cholinergic nerve transmission via inhibition of AChE. The symptoms of intoxication comprise nicotinic, muscarinic and central symptoms, for some OP\/nerve agents, a delayed neurotoxicity is observed. Cholinesterases (AChE and BuChE) are characterized as the main enzymes involved in the toxic effect of these compounds including their molecular forms. The activity of both enzymes (and molecular forms) is influenced by inhibitors and other factors such as pathological states. There are different methods for cholinesterase determination, however, the most frequent is the method based on the hydrolysis of thiocholine esters and following detection of free SH-group of the released thiocholine. The diagnosis of OP\/nerve agents poisoning is based on anamnesis, the clinical status of the intoxicated organism and on cholinesterase determination in the blood. Some principles of prophylaxis against OP\/nerve agents poisoning comprising the administration of reversible cholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine (alone or in combination with other drugs), scavengers such as preparations of cholinesterases, some therapeutic drugs and possible combinations are given. Basic principles of the treatment of nerve agents\/OP poisoning are described. New drugs for the treatment are under experimental study based on new approaches to the mechanism of action.","573":"Breast cancer is a frequent cause of death among women with gynaecologic malignancies despite the introduction of combination chemotherapy. There is therefore a need for new therapeutic strategies for patients with breast cancer, such as cellular immunotherapy. In this immunohistochemical study we analyzed the epithelial expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (HLA-DR) on atypical and malignant primary mammary epithelial cells, as well as the magnitude of the stromal T lymphocytes (T4 subset) at the tumor site. The study was carried out retrospectively in tumor tissue from 82 patients with mammary lesions (31 cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia -ADH-, 12 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ -DCIS- and 39 cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified -IDC-NOS). Medullary carcinomas were not included in our investigation. Material used had been formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. HLA class II (DR) was expressed in 20 of 31 ADHs (64.5%), in 4 of 12 DCISs (33.3%), and in 10 of 39 IDC-NOSs (25.6%). CD4 was expressed in 9 of 31 ADHs (29%), in 5 of 12 DCISs (42%), and in 26 of 39 IDC-NOSs (67%). The results showed decreased epithelial expression of HLA class II (DR) and increased stromal expression of CD4, as the lesion progressed to malignancy. Gradual loss of epithelial HLA class II expression might be a manifestation of cellular differentiation from the atypical form versus the malignant one, signaling simultaneously a selective effect on the response capacity of the immune system. ","574":"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) as one the technique of Scanning Probe Microscopy is useful for imaging of surface structure. This method can yield three-dimensional high-resolution topographic images of sample surfaces by using a scanning technique for conductors and insulators on atomic scale. It is based upon mapping of atomic-forces on a surface of an investigated sample. The method is useful not only in physics and chemistry; it can be also applied in biological fields. Special construction of AFM scanner enables to follow biological samples in liquid environments. Artifacts caused by dehydration of samples are removed this way. Dentin of human teeth is a vital hydrated tissue. It is strongly sensitive to dehydration and drying that are commonly used in preparation of samples in examinations by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). We describe our experience in examination of dentin surfaces of extracted human third molars using contact method of AFM under moist conditions.","575":"Vocalization calls are behaviorally relevant complex sounds that typically contain several harmonics and show frequency and amplitude modulation. In this paper, an introduction to a software tool for the analysis of species-specific vocalizations is presented. The algorithm automatically or under user supervision detects time-varying amplitude and frequency parameters, which can serve for the statistical analysis of calls or as the substrate for the manipulation and synthesis of artificial calls. The described program and its results will be used in studying the representation of complex sounds in the central nervous system.","576":"Structural and functional stability of bovine cytochrome c oxidase as a function of exposure to high hydrostatic pressure is reported. The pressure affects the stability of monomeric and dimeric enzyme quite differently. Exposure of the monomeric cytochrome c oxidase to pressures higher than 2.5 kbar causes dissociation of subunits III, VIa, VIb, VIIa with a 35-50% decrease in electron transport activity. Dimeric enzyme is more resistant to high hydrostatic pressure since subunits III and VIIa do not dissociate and the electron transport activity loss is minimal.","577":"Stuttering affects people all over the world. At the age of six years, about 1.5 percent of children suffers from stuttering. Although stuttering resolves spontaneously upon reaching adulthood in approximately 80% of those affected, it continues to have significant health and social consequences. So far, its etiology remains unknown. The organic differences in those with stuttering and those free of speech problems have been evaluated. As a result of these examinations, it has been hypothesized that stuttering results from functional pneumoobstruction of the tracheobronchial tree in the peripheral respiratory passages. As for now, no similar therapeutic procedure, using a bronchodilating agent in the treatment of stuttering, has been described. Preliminary findings of a pilot study are surprisingly positive. In October of 2003, a multicenter open clinical trial (Stage III) to verify the effect of a sympathomimetic agent formoterol was initiated. The study is being realized in six centers in Moravia and enrolls approx. 40 patients (children, adolescents and young adults). First experience and initial evaluation of the cohort are presented here.","578":"The aim of this study was analysis of DNA damage in the cell line of the human melanoma G361 after photodynamic therapy (PDT) by comet assay. Photodynamic therapy is based on cytotoxic action of sensitizers (10 microM ZnTPPS4 fixed into 1 mM cyclodextrin hpbetaCD) and light with a suitable wavelength. Single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE, comet assay) is a rapid and sensitive method for detecting DNA strand breaks at the level of single cells. Great amount of DNA damage was detected with the dose of irradiation of 0.1; 0.5 J and 2.5 J x cm(-2). Only radiation dose of visible light in the presence of sensitizers can induce DNA breaks of tumour cells. Cells with DNA damage appear as fluorescent comets with tails of DNA fragmentation. In contrast, cells with undamage DNA appear as round spots, because their intact DNA does not migrate out of the cell.","579":"The influence of D-glucose on a lipid solid support system with the aid of impedance spectrocopy as a preliminary attempt for the biosensing of medical relevant molecules was studied. In spite of some shortcomings, s-BLM's proved to be an appropriate model for the study of lipid membrane-D-glucose interactions. The shortcomings were the roughness of the metal support, and the lack of homogeneity in the monolayer or multilayer lipid structures.","580":"Although body surface electrocardiographic mapping is used also in clinical practice, there are only a few papers concerning the isointegral maps (IIMs) in children. We constructed IIMs of 169 healthy young people during the initial parts of the QRS complex: the first 20 ms (QRS20), 30 ms (QRS30), 40 ms (QRS40), and from 20 ms to 40 ms (QRS(20-40)). Subjects were divided into 6 groups: 9-10 y (F1, M1), 13-14 y (F2, M2), 18-19 y (F3; M3). We analysed the extreme values of each time integral. We found maxima and peak-to-peak values decreasing with age, while minima tended to increase (became less negative). Most age differences were found in IIM QRS(20-40) and between peak-to-peak values. Least differences were between minima. Maxima and peak-to-peak values were higher in males than in females. No significant differences were found in any extreme value between groups F1 and M1 except for IIM QRS20 maxima. Significant sex differences increased with age. The only significant difference found in minima was between F2 and M2. Most sex differences were found in IIM QRS20. We assume that our findings can be explained (at least in part) by the influence of heart-chest geometry.","581":"Photodynamic therapy of cancer uses the interaction of sensitizers and light to destroy cancer cells. In this study we tested the cellular uptake of meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphine (TPPS4) and its complex PdTPPS4 in the presence or absence of 2-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrins (hpCDs) on G361 human melanoma cells. Self-fluorescence in G361 cells were measured by Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminometer equipped with well plate reader accessory. Morphological changes in cells have been evaluated using inversion fluorescent microscope Olympus IX 70 and image analysis. The uptake of the sensitizer PdTPPS4 at the given time interval from 1 to 48 hours is markedly higher than the uptake of TPPS4. The highest uptake was found for sensitizer PdTPPS4 in combination with hpbetaCD. TPPS4 and PdTPPS4 especially in the supramolecular complex with nontoxic cyclodextrin carriers represent efficient sensitizers for photodynamic therapy in vitro on G361 cells.","582":"The objective of our work was to describe the photophysical properties (absorption and fluorescence) of the sensitizers TPPS4, ZnTPPS4 a PdTPPS4 and above all the complexes of these sensitizers with cyclodextrin carriers HP-alpha-CD, HP-beta-CD and HP-gamma-CD (2-hydroxypropyl-alpha, beta, gamma-cyclodextrin) in a suitable environment for the cultivation of cancerous cell lines, and to determine the optimal radioactive conditions for maximizing photodynamic effects in cancerous cells.","583":"Disadvantage of ultrasonography is its dependence on subjective assessment of displayed images. The way how to minimize both intraobserver and interobserver differences is creation of standard conditions for examination including a quantitative approach to evaluation of tissue reflectivity. The oldest mode of standardisation is standardised A- scan, used in ophthalmology. It enables differentiation of echoes, reflected from different ocular structures and is helpful in assessment of extraocular muscle thickness. Standardisation of B-scan depends on the type of diagnostic device and is based on quantification of image echogenicity. In our study reference values of grey-level histogram were established for some thyroid diseases using standard setting of imaging parameters. Results indicate that both standardised A- and B-scan should be helpful in differential diagnostics.","584":"The stents or stentgrafts (covered stents) are the medical instruments used in invasive radiology for miniinvasive treatment of stenosis and aneurisms especially in the blood circulation system. We measured and compared the mechanical parameters of different selfexpandable Nitinol stents, which differed in the geometry (radius and length), in the type of construction (number of branches and rising of winding) and in the diameter of the used wire. The results of measurements confirmed the theoretical assumptions that just the diameter of the Nitinol wire significantly influences the rigidity and the level of compressibility of the stent as well. The compromise must be found between the required rigidity of the stent and the minimal size of the delivery system. The exact description of the relation between the mechanical properties and geometry and construction of the stents enables us to design the stent to fit the patient's needs. The results of measurement are also necessary for the design and identification of the parameters of the models of the stents.","585":"Mechanical properties of biological structures affect functional ability of organism. Current knowledge is prevailingly concentrated on static characteristics. The present work analyzed dynamic mechanical responses of various biological materials. Following biological structures were measured: samples of aorta walls of human origin and from model organisms, human body surface, and samples of bones of various types and origin. Linear approximation leads in case of aortas and bones to simple Voight's model. Modules of elasticity (in tensile loading) of aortas were from 10(2) kPa to 10(3) kPa. Module of elasticity of bones were from 10(6) Pa to 10(10) Pa. Viscous coefficients of aortas were from 102 Pa.s to 10(3) Pa.s. Viscous coefficients of bones were from 10(0) Pa.s to 10(2) Pa.s. Nonlinearities: We found that following types of nonlinearities are significant: strain-stress relationship, time-dependent changes in elastic as well as viscose bodies. Strain and stress is well approximated by quadratic function sigma = a epsilon2 + b epsilon + c with parameters a = 1833, b = 135, c = 20.0 (porcine aorta). Time-dependence in elastic coefficient: At the beginning of responses the elastic coefficient was of 42% lower then at 0.02 s of duration of the response (porcine aortas). Analogical results follow also from experiments on other structures (skin, bones).","586":"In medical sonography, sonograph image quality is an essential aspect for the safety of both patient and doctor. Its evaluation therefore requires an accurate and objective method for measurement. In this regard, a number of methods are in current use. Most of these are based on tissue mimicking phantom imaging. In contrast, we have used another principle based on Point Spread Function (PSF) analysis which is a product of the measuring system we have developed. In this case, the measured sonograph scans a small metallic ball target that moves in a water bath on a specified trajectory. The Region Of Interest (ROI) of the sonogram containing the ball target picture is digitised and the amplitude of the pixels analysed. The result is the PSF from which we calculate the lateral resolution (LR). For this purpose, we use our own original software. Using this method, we have to date been able to plot LR characteristics over the scanning plane. The method allows us to differentiate separate scanning lines and even multiple focal areas for dynamic focussing systems. It can detect malfunctions in dynamic focussing, size of aperture, time gain compensation function and\/or transducer element failure. The procedure itself is not as easy or as fast to use as tissue mimicking phantoms or 3D signal to noise ratio evaluation, but it provides accurate and objective numeric parameters corresponding to the quality of image at any specified point over the whole scanning area. It is also a very powerful tool when used in combination with the other methods mentioned above.","587":"","588":"Preconditioning of the brain by short-term ischemia increases brain tolerance to the subsequent severer ischemia. In this study, we investigated iron deposition in the cerebral cortex and the ischemic tolerance in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. Forebrain ischemia was induced by four-vessel occlusion for 5 min as ischemic preconditioning. Two days after preconditioning or after the sham-operation, the second ischemia was induced for 20 min. Changes in the cerebral cortex were examined after 1 to 8 weeks of recirculation following 20 min ischemia with or without preconditioning using the iron histochemistry. Granular deposits of the iron were found in the cytoplasm of the pyramidal cells in the layers III and V of the frontal cortex after 1 week of recirculation. When the rats were exposed to 5 min ischemia 2 days before 20 min lasting ischemia, the deposition of iron in the cytoplasm of the pyramidal cells in layers III and V of the frontal cortex was significantly lower during all periods of reperfusion. Preconditioning 5 min ischemia followed by 2 days of reperfusion before 20 min ischemia also prevented degeneration of the pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the frontal cortex.","589":"Stomach volvulus in its acute form is a serious sudden disorder in the abdominal cavity. The case of stomach volvulus, that had been successfully surgically solved, is described in the presented paper. Even though the volvulus was not caused by the hiatus hernia, the antireflux fundoplication according to Nissen-Rossetti was performed besides the frontal gastropexy.","590":"Calciphylaxis is an uncommon complication of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism. It characterized by cutaneous necrosis with mural calcifications and thrombosis in the small vessels of dermis. It is important to diagnose and treat, because of mortality rate from calciphylaxis is very high. We present the case of a patient with ESRD and type II diabetes mellitus developing calciphylaxis of the both upper and lower extremities had normal corrected calcium-phosphate product level. After amputation, necrosis was showed rapid progression resulting in death in one month.","591":"Even though coffee is not considered to be responsible for development of peptic ulcer, it may, however, prolong its healing by increasing acidity of gastric content. In our former work we observed a profound increase in sucrose permeability (above normal values) in healthy volunteers regularly drinking coffee for years. In literature, many factors affecting sucrose permeability have been described so far. None of them, however, studied the effect of coffee. 10 young asymptomatic habitual coffee drinkers were included in the study. The probands underwent SaLM test twice--first time without coffee restriction and second time after 48-hour coffee abstinence. The ingested SaLM solution comprised sucrose (25.0 g), lactulose (10.0 g), mannitol (2.0 g), xylose (2.0 g) and water (up to 100 ml). Urine was collected for five hours and the samples were analysed using gas chromatography. Results were compared with those of 8 young healthy volunteers not drinking coffee. Permeability for sucrose was significantly higher in the group of habitual coffee drinkers in comparison with non-coffee drinkers (p &lt; 0.01). After 48-hour coffee abstinence sucrose excretion decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) to a level not differing from that of non-coffee drinkers (p = 0.54). Our results indicate that coffee may damage gastroduodenal mucosa in habitual coffee drinkers. In a time period of 48 hours the gastroduodenal mucosa is capable of a significant regeneration. ","592":"The aim of this study is to report our 3years experience with the screening of congenital disorders of glycosylation. A common isoelectric focusing method with immunofixation was used for analysis of serum transferrin and alpha1-antitrypsin, apart from several other procedures. A group of about 1000 individuals, both healthy controls and patients, mostly with signs of a metabolic disease were examined. Here we present an overview of (1) hypoglycosylation findings, (2) distribution of protein variants, (3) misguiding rare Tf variants found in our set, and (4) association of some phenotypes with various diseases.","593":"One of the factors involved in accelerated atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients is dyslipidemia. In this study we considered factors involved in intensification of dyslipidemia in hemodialysis patients. This study was done on 36 maintenance hemodialysis patients. Serum lipoprotein (a), Triglyceride, Cholesterol, HDL-C,LDL-C and also serum Intact parathormone(iPTH), Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium were measured. In statistical analysis there was not any correlation between serum lipids and iPTH. There was not correlation between serum calcium with serum lipids (p &gt; 0.05). There was not correlation between CaxP product with serum lipids (p &gt; 0.05). There was a positive correlation between serum Magnesium and Lipoprotein(a) (P &lt; 0.05) and also positive correlation between serum magnesium with triglyceride level (P &lt; 0.05) was seen too. Magnesium doesn't increase the lipoprotein synthesis. It may involve in the regulation of some enzymes responsible for lipoprotein synthesis. Correlation of serum magnesium with serum triglycerides can be due to changes in hepatic triglyceride metabolism. Lipoprotein(a) is a non traditional factor of premature atherosclerosis, its association with serum magnesium needs more attention in hemodialysis patients.","594":"This study was designed to determine the effects of pretransplant ischemic hypothermic period on reactivities of major coronary arteries. Eleven pigs were used. Right, left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries harvested from 6 pigs following single dose of cardioplegia and cardiectomy. The same procedures were performed in 5 pigs after 6 hours static 4 degrees C hypothermic preservation of the hearts. Strips prepared from these 3 coronary arteries were placed in organ chambers and contractions with acetylcholine and histamine and KCL and dilatations with noradrenaline following submaximal contractions with acetylcholine and histamine were documented. There was no statistically significant difference between results taken from both groups. The pretransplant period (until 6 hours) does not cause important differences on the reactivities of coronary arteries.","595":"The toxicity of cyclohexyl methylphosphonofluoridate (GF-agent; cyclosarin) and therapeutic efficacy of four oximes (trimedoxime, methoxime, obidoxime and HI-6) in combination with atropine or benactyzine (BNZ) was studied in mice. The oxime therapy combined with anticholinergic drug was administered intramusculary (i.m.) 1 or 2 min after i.m. GF-agent challenge. All the drugs were applied in dose of 20% of LD50. Obidoxime and trimedoxime that were combined with atropine were less effective than methoxime and HI-6 in combination with BNZ when applied 2 minutes after GF-agent poisoning. When the drugs were administered 1 min after GF-agent challenge already, in case of methoxime, the faster application of therapy resulted in significantly higher protective ratio, while for obidoxime the therapeutic effectivity did not depend significantly on the seasonableness of therapeutic intervention. The present findings show that all four combinations of oxime with anticholinergic drug decrease the GF-agent toxicity more than twofold regardless of the time of treatment administration.","596":"In this study the rate of dissolution of mercury from two dental amalgams with different compositions and structures was determined in vitro under different oxidation and abrasion conditions, and the results were correlated with the electrochemical characteristics. A spherical high copper and a lathe-cut very high-copper amalgam were tested in aerated and deaerated artificial saliva. The electrochemical characteristics were determined by potential-time, anodic polarization, polarization resistance and cathodic stripping measurements. Mercury release tests were performed after either stabilization in the solution, or abrasion using SiC papers or rotary toothbrush, with or without toothpaste. Dissolved mercury was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Both amalgams exhibited passivation, the amalgam with the higher copper content passivating spontaneously even when the oxygen content in the solution was minimized. At a higher oxygen content in the solution the rate of mercury release from the amalgams was lower than when the oxygen content was minimized, and decreased further after a pre-exposure. Brushing generally increased the release. The results show the importance of the oxidation conditions and passivation characteristics of dental amalgams for mercury release, especially in the transient state after abrasion by chewing or tooth brushing. ","597":"The subependymal zone (SEZ) lining lateral walls of the lateral cerebral ventricles represents the site of active neurogenesis in the brain of adult mammals. Peroxidase immunohistochemistry performed in paraffin-embedded sections reveals that structural organization of the SEZ differs from other regions in the brain. The SEZ is devoid of synapses that are abundant in the adjacent striatal neuropil. Therefore immunostaining of synaptophysin detects sharp borders of the SEZ. Using immunophenotypization, we identified cell types constituting the SEZ in the intact rat forebrain. The presence of neural progenitor\/stem cells was confirmed by finding of nestin-immunopositive cells. Detection of the astroglial marker GFAP confirmed that astrocytes represented major supporting elements responsible for creating a unique microenvironment of the SEZ. One type of the astroglia participated in covering surfaces of the blood vessels and boundaries of the SEZ. The second astroglial cell type formed branched elongated tubes that enwrapped other SEZ cell types with their cytoplasmic extensions. The interior of astrocytic channels was occupied with small densely aggregated NCAM-immunoreactive neuroblasts. Bipolar morphology indicated that these cells probably underwent migration. Immunodetection of other neuronal markers like beta-III tubulin, MAP-2 and Pan neurofilaments identified positive cells in the neighbouring brain parenchyma but not in the SEZ. The rostral migratory stream (RMS) linked with the anterior SEZ had a similar structural arrangement. It contained a large amount of nestin+ and vimentin+ cells. The RMS consisted of GFAP+ astrocytic tubes ensheathing NCAM+ neuroblasts. On the contrary to the SEZ, the RMS neuroblasts expressed beta-III tubulin. However, markers of postmitotic neurons MAP-2, Pan neurofilaments and synaptophysin were not expressed in the RMS. Our study describes a complex histological structure of the rat SEZ, identifies its individual cell types and demonstrates a usefulness of immunohistochemical detection of cell-specific markers in a study of microenvironment forming neurogenic zones in the mammalian brain.","598":"Tooth eruption follows a chronology corresponding to the date when the tooth erupts into the oral cavity. This date has been established in the literature and is subject to small variations depending on hereditary, endocrine and environmental features. Any disturbance during the development of the teeth -systemic or local- can affect not only the morphology, structure of dental hard tissues or number of teeth but also the time of eruption. The presence of a tooth in the mouth at birth or during the first month of life has been studied and denominated as natal and neonatal teeth. The aim of this paper is to review current information on this topic and to give treatment alternatives if it is necessary.","599":"The serine hydrolases and proteases are a ubiquitous group of enzymes that is fundamental to many critical life-functions. Human tissues have two distinct cholinesterase activities: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Acetylcholinesterase functions in the transmission of nerve impulses, whereas the physiological function of butyrylcholinesterase remains unknown. Acetylcholinesterase is one of the crucial enzymes in the central and peripheral nerve system. Organophosphates and carbamates are potent inhibitors of serine hydrolases and well suited probes for investigating the chemical reaction mechanism of the inhibition. Understanding the enzyme's chemistry is essential in preventing and\/or treating organophosphate and carbamate poisoning as well as designing new medicaments for cholinergic-related diseases like as Alzheimer's disease.","600":"Using ubiquitin immunohistochemistry and impregnative Nauta method we demonstrated that ubiquitin positivity and Nauta positivity in the neurons affected with ischemic injury in the lumbosacral spinal cord of rabbits and dogs may be of the same origin. Increased number of ubiquitin-positive aggregates was found in the cytoplasm of neurons in the intermediate zone and lamina IX of ventral horns of spinal cord in rabbits after 30 min of ischemia followed by 24 h lasting reperfusion. Nauta-positive, flocculent, intracytoplasmic, dark clusters appeared in the same localization in the canine lumbosacral spinal cord neurons after 30 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Ubiquitin aggregates and Nauta-positive dark clusters in the injured spinal cord neurons could be the first light microscopic signs of slow neuronal death following spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion.","601":"The presence and intraorgan distribution of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive nerve structures in the guinea-pig spleen were studied by means of the direct thiocholine method. Visualized AChE-positive nerve fibres entered the guinea-pig spleen at its hilum in the vicinity of the splenic artery branches and intra parenchyma were gradually distributed to form thicker periarterial nerves and also fine adventitial nerve plexus. In described topography the AChE-positive nerve fibres were identified in association with the central artery running through the white pulp. Some of the perivascular nerve fibres associated with the central artery extended away and passed into the periarterial lymphatic sheath (PALS) to reach the marginal zone and in continuation entered into the mantle zone of lymphatic follicles. Several AChE-positive nerve fibres were seen in the red pulp but less in the splenic capsule. We did not find any AChE-positive nerve cells in the guinea-pig spleen.","602":"Innervation of the spleen in rats was studied. Butyrylcholinesterase-(BuChE)-positive nerve components of the organ were visualized by the direct thiocholine method. BuChE-positive nerve components enter the spleen in a common bundle with arteries. In the organ they form characteristic periarterial and periarteriolar plexiform arrangements, which are especially conspicuous around the aa. centrales running through the white pulp. Then, nerve fibres extend away from these plexuses into adjacent layers of trabeculae further into marginal layers of periarterial lymphatic sheath (PALS) as well as into the mantle zone of follicles. Several scattered periarteriolar and solitary nerve fibres can be seen in the marginal sinuses and cords of the red pulp. In the fibrous capsula BuChE-positive nerve fibres can also be seen which have an evident connection with trabecular and parenchymal nerves of the organ. Microscopic findings support the notion that BuChE-positive nerve profiles supply not only the vasculature, but also the parenchymal components of the spleen, and they may participate, to a great extent, in the regulation of the immune processes in this organ.","603":"To determine the expression of CMV-associated antigen in the human decidual endometrial stromal cells in spontaneous abortions with no evidence of maternal relapse during the first trimester of gestation. We examined 15 placentas resulting from intrauterine fetal death after spontaneous abortion during the 8th, 10th, and 12th week of gestation respectively, and in which CMV reactivation was ruled out from serological evaluation of the pregnant women at admission, versus equal controls after voluntary abortion following well-documented maternal viral recurrence. In addition, a panel of monoclonal antibodies for the identification of leukocytes (CD45\/LCA), B-lymphocytes (CD20\/L-26), and T-lymphocytes (CD45RO\/UCHL1), was performed. All women received hormonal medication to support gestation, in the cases of spontaneous abortions. Immunohistochemical examination using a specific antibody against cytomegalovirus showed large multinucleated infected cells with intranuclear inclusions, located primarily in the decidual stroma within a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the cases of spontaneous abortions. No evidence of infection was observed in the chorionic villi. In the cases of voluntary abortions same findings were observed in the relevant areas, and a strong evidence of infection was observed in the chorionic villi. This study demonstrates 1) that the decidual endometrial stromal cells can express the CMV-associated antigen prior to serological manifestation of the viral replication, 2) the expression of the antigen is higher in cases of hormonal administration to support gestation. In these cases a mild mononuclear infiltrate of UCHL1 (T marker) positive cells, accompanies the CMV-associated antigen positive cells. ","604":"Vitamin A levels during pregnancy have important influences on the health of pregnant women and the growing fetus. Therefore, plasma vitamin A and beta-carotene concentrations during pregnancy in Turkish women living in Gaziantep city were investigated in a prevalence study. Optimum sample size was determined as 252 for vitamin A deficiency and vitamin A and beta-carotene levels were examined in 427 pregnant women aged 14-44 years. Vitamin A and beta-carotene concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically by Neeld Pearson method. Vitamin A and beta-carotene concentrations in pregnant women were found as 1.14 +\/- 0.44 micromol\/L, and 1.80 +\/- 0.66 micromol\/L, respectively. Plasma vitamin A concentrations were found in low levels (&lt;1.05 micromol\/L) in 45.5% of pregnant women. Vitamin A deficiency (&lt;0.7 micromol\/L) was determined in 16.9% of pregnant women. A mild negative correlation was obtained between the vitamin A concentration and pregnancy period. Vitamin A levels of pregnant women were decreased significantly in the third trimester (p&lt;0.05). The findings of present study suggest that vitamin A levels of pregnant women were poor in the region. Therefore, the intake of vitamin A with foods should be improved. Supplementation of vitamin A might benefit at improving maternal and child health especially in high-risk groups especially in developing countries. Monitoring vitamin A levels in pregnant women is very important for also determining low and high levels.","605":"In two splenectomized siblings with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type-II (CDA-II) and iron overload excess of Pappenheimer bodies reaching 46.4% and 15.9% respectively was found. Cause, significance and differential diagnosis of this finding were discussed.","606":"The apoptosis failure in cytostatic treatment of haemoblastosis is one of the means of chemoresistance. We were interested in the relationship of the after-doxorubicin-treatment-AML cells apoptosis and the immunophenotype, selected clinical and laboratory parameters, and also the P-gp, MRP, LRP, Bcl-2, Bax proteins expression. All analysis were evaluated with the flow cytometry method. To detect apoptotic cells in the sample, we used three methods: annexin test, TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) test, and caspase 8 detection. After the cell cultivation the statisticaly important increase of apoptotic cells in the culture was apparent. The relation between the AML blast in vitro reaction and some clinical parameters such as the age of patient, white blood cell count, and blast percentage was also observed.","607":"Our previous findings suggested the existence of stressor-specific behavioural and cognitive responses in rats. In the present study, restraint stressor (immobilization, IMO) and restraint stressor combined with partial immersion of rats into water (IMO+C) were applied for 1 hour to Wistar male rats and their spontaneous behaviour was examined in the open field test. The classic behavioural parameters were recorded: crossing, rearing, and resting. When tested 1 and 4 hours after IMO+C, animals exhibited strong suppression of locomotor and exploratory activity (crossing and rearing); partial inhibition of both behavioural variables was found after IMO. Thus, substantial differences were observed in dependence on the length of period between the end of stressor application and the start of testing. In testing performed one week later, the locomotor and exploratory activity levels of both IMO and IMO+C animals corresponded to the control ones. These data suggest a differential behavioural response to both used stressors that may result from their different proportion of psychical and physical components. In conclusion, our results provide other data for the support of differential effects of two types of restraint stressors on spontaneous behaviour of animals exposed to a novel environment.","608":"1. The influence of two anticholinergic drugs (atropine, trihexyphenidyle) on the effectiveness of antidotal treatment to eliminate soman-induced lethal effects and convulsions was studied in rats. 2. The oxime HI-6 when combined with centrally acting anticholinergic drug trihexyphenidyle seems to be more efficacious in the elimination of acute toxic effects of soman than its combination with atropine. 3. The findings support the hypothesis that the choice of the anticholinergic drug is important for the effectiveness of antidotal mixture in the case of antidotal treatment of soman-induced acute poisoning.","609":"The oxime K005 [1,3-bis(2-hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium) propane dibromide] for the reactivation of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibited by cyclosarin and VX was tested. Its reactivation potency was not better in comparison with the currently used AChE reactivator--pralidoxime. On the other hand, the oxime K005 has its maximum reactivation ability at the concentration 10(-4) M, which could be achieved for human use. The maximum concentration of pralidoxime was reached at the concentrations 10(-1) M (for cyclosarin) and 10(-3) M (for VX) but these concentrations are not available for the use in vivo.","610":null,"611":"Endothelins are endogenous vasoactive peptides that are considered among the most potent vasoconstrictor substances known.

Preoccupation of this article is triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO). These are short, synthetic single-stranded DNAs that recognize polypurine:polypyrimidine regions in double stranded DNA in a sequence-specific manner and form triplex. Therefore, the mechanisms for DNA recognition by triple helix formation are discussed, together with main characteristics of TFO and also major obstacles that remain to be overcome are highlighted. TFOs can selectively inhibit gene expression at the transcriptional level or repair genetic defect by direct genome modification in human cells. These qualities makes TFO potentially powerful therapeutic tool for gene repair and\/or expression regulation.","613":"","614":null,"615":"This modified surgical procedure that permits an implantation simultaneously with sinus floor elevation procedure even when the original bone is very thin.

These genotypes are classified as I and D alleles which are termed as insertion and deletion, respectively. This study was carried out to identify possible relationships between the insertion\/deletion (I\/D) polymorphisms and athletic performance in Turkish athletes. To be able to determine these relationships, eighty healthy athletes and eighty healthy sedentary controls were genotyped for the ACE I\/D polymorphism at gene level. According to the results obtained, we found significant difference on ACE I\/D polymorphism in between athletes and healthy controls (x2 = 7.32, df = 2, P = 0.026). This result supports the association in ACE genotype in Turkish athletes, suggesting that this might be a genetic factor influencing the physical performance.","617":"Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase I and II activities of peripheral mononuclear cells were studied to evaluate their role in diagnosis, assessment of therapy and follow up of remission in acute leukaemias. Blood samples were obtained from 40 untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukaemia and 40 healthy controls, before the therapy and after remission. The correlation between the activity of the enzymes and the efficacy of therapy were established. The enzyme activities were measured by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), using the method described by Amici. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon methods were used. Before the therapy, Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase I levels in the leukaemic group were found to be significantly elevated when compared to the control group (p&lt;0.001). Also Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase II levels were significantly elevated before the therapy and during remission (p&lt;0.02 and p&lt;0.001 respectively). The isoenzyme activities were compared in patients who were in remission, who did not respond to therapy and in patients who died during the therapy, but no significant difference was found. We concluded that, Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase I and II activities can be used as markers for diagnosis and follow up of remission in patients with acute leukaemia. But, they can not have predictive value for prognosis. ","618":"To investigate the importance of urinal neopterin detection carried out together with cervical smear test, in the diagnosis of cervical cancer. In this study, urine samples were collected from randomly selected vulvovaginitis' women who attended hospital and an independent control group. The participants were classified into two representative sample groups and a control group; 1st Group: 35 women with vulvovaginitis, whose ages varied from 21 to 42 and who had no viral infections, and chronic inflammatory diseases and no smoking habit, but had complaints of vaginal discharge. 2nd Group: 25 women aged between 38-52 with no smoking habit, who applied to hospital with complaints of vaginal discharge, and cervical cancer was diagnosed for them as the result of biopsy, but no associated treatment of cancer had been carried out yet. 3rd Group: A control group with 30 women who aged between 20 and 28, with no smoking habit, and who had not taken part in sexual activities yet. They had no complaints from any type of tumors, and viral infections or chronic inflammatory diseases. Urinalysis was carried out for each group member's urine sample in order to measure the level of neopterin. Neopterin was estimated by HPLC. Some statistical analyses were done by SPSS Windows 10.0 and were analyzed by Oneway Annova test. (p=0.000) Meaningful differences between the groups were determined by Post Hoc Tukey Test. The mathematical results of neopterin levels for the groups revealed that the level of Group 1 was significantly higher than the level of Group 3 (p= 0.0001). When the levels of Group 1 and 2 were compared with each other, a significant difference was determined (p=0.004). Also, the difference in the levels of Group 2 and 3 was found to be significant (p=0.0001). If the results of this study were not confounded by another factor, then we can deduce that an increment in the level of neopterin may be considered as a risk factor that should warrant further investigation of cervical cancer. Then, the detection of urinal neopterin level as a noninvasive test done together with cervical smear can increase the sensitivity of smear test. ","619":"To detect whether preeclampsia influences neonatal intrahepatic hematopoiesis, given that an activation of fetal neutrophils and monocytes during the course of this disorder occurs. We examined liver samples from 10 neonates of hypertensive\/preeclamptic women at 27 to 28 weeks of gestation delivered by a cessarian section. All neonates were placed in incubators but they all died within 24 hours due to immaturity. The control group comprised 10 fetuses of the same gestational age, after voluntary abortion due to a neural defect. Specific antibodies against CD34, glycophorin C, hemoglobins A and F, myeloperoxidase, CD61, CD68, terminal desoxynucleotidyl transferase and the pax-5\/B-cell specific activator protein, were used in each sample. Neonates from hypertensive\/preeclamptic women, in comparison with controls, showed: a statistically significant reduction of erythropoiesis by 25% (p=0.015); a statistically significant increase of granulopoiesis (p=0.019); a statistically significant increase in the expression of CD68 positive cells of the monocytic lineage (p=0.017); a statistically significant increase in the expression of CD34 progenitor\/stem positive cells (p=0.021). No statistically significant differences were observed in both examined groups, concerning megakaryopoiesis and B lymphopoiesis. Preeclampsia of pregnancy has an impact on neonatal intrahepatic hematopoiesis by increasing granulopoiesis, reducing erythropoiesis and triggering endothelial and stem cell activation. We suggest that these findings reflect a state of persistent inflammation and a loss of red blood cell production possibly contributing to the neonatal morbidity related to this disorder. ","620":"Three decontamination solutions of beta-cyclodextrines were prepared. Their abilities to decontamine rat skin contamined with nerve agent soman were tested. Decontamination efficacy of the tested cyclodextrine solutions was compared with the same decontamination means but without the cyclodextrines. The efficacy of tested decontaminants was evaluated by the assessment of the ID50 values. Two decontamination prescriptions with cyclodextrines (tetraborate buffer and tetraborate buffer with acetone) do not show significantly better decontamination efficacies in comparison with prescriptions without cyclodextrines. Only in case of aqueous solution of 2-aminoethanol the addition of beta-cyclodextrine resulted in significant increase (32%) in decontamination efficacy.","621":"1. The influence of the time of administration of antidotal treatment consisting of anticholinergic drug (atropine) and oxime (pralidoxime, obidoxime, HI-6 or trimedoxime) on its effectiveness to eliminate tabun-induced lethal effects was studied in mice. 2. The therapeutic efficacy of antidotal treatment of tabun-induced acute poisoning depends on the time of its administration when obidoxime or the oxime HI-6 was used as an acetylcholinesterase reactivator. 3. Pralidoxime is practically ineffective to eliminate acute toxic effects of tabun regardless of the time of its administration. 4. Our results show that trimedoxime seems to be the most effective to eliminate lethal effects of tabun. In addition, its efficacy does not decrease when it is administered 5 min after tabun poisoning. 5. The findings support the hypothesis that trimedoxime appears to be the most suitable oxime to counteract acute toxicity of tabun because of its ability to eliminate lethal effects of tabun when it is injected 5 min after tabun challenge on the contrary to other oximes tested.","622":"We have tested four new bisquaternary pyridinium acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) reactivators - K005 (1,3-bis(2-hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium) propane dibromide), K033 (1,4-bis(2-hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium) butane dibromide), K027 (1 -(4-hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium)-3-(4-carbamoylpyridinium) propane dibromide) and K048 (1-(4-hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium)-4-(4-carbamoylpyridinium) butane dibromide) as the potential reactivators of AChE inhibited by cyclosarin. Their reactivation potencies were studied using standard in vitro reactivation test. Rat brain homogenate was used as the source of the enzyme. Oxime K033 seems to be the most potent reactivator of cyclosarin-inhibited AChE. Its reactivation potency is significantly higher than the efficacy of all other tested AChE reactivators.","623":"To determine the immunoreactivity of cholecystokinin (CCK) during the development of the human fetal pancreas and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, given that, CCK positive cells were demonstrated either in its embryonic anlage or in pancreatic cancer. In order to obtain possible parallels in the expression pattern of neoplastic cells in adults (well--moderately--poorly differentiated), we investigated the pattern of CCK expression in the pancreatic tissue during the various stages of development and compared these with the proliferation of tissue assessed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry. Tissue sections from 15 pancreatic fetal specimens, and equal number of ductal adenocarcinoma specimens, were assessed using immunohistochemical methods for CCK. The density of positive cells in the primitive exocrine ductal walls and outgrowing buds was significantly higher than the relevant density in the neoplastic pancreatic tissue of mixed (ductal-endocrine) and pure ductal type (p1=0.004, p2 &lt; 0.0005, p3 &lt; 0.0005 and p4=0.023 respectively). The above values were estimated from 20th to 22nd weeks of gestation. There was no significant difference in the density of positive cells in the islet cell epithelium from 25-30 weeks, and the neoplastic tissue of mixed (p5=0.10) and pure ductal type (p6=0.15). The immunostaining for CCK identifies a sub-group of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas with a neuroendocrine component (initially considered as pure ductal tumors), and mixed ductal-endocrine tumors. This pattern of expression in neoplasms recapitulates the normal pattern during the embryonal development of the organ, and may be important for the development of new therapeutic approaches with eventual clinical utility. ","624":"Methods of processing and cryopreservation are believed to be the most important factors of long term clinical performance of biological heart valve prostheses. That is why we decided to cooperate in evaluating the impact of current AHV (allograft heartvalve) bank protocol on valve tissue morphology. AHV harvested from \"heart-beating\" cadaveric donors, considered as a fresh tissue, were compared with valve samples from non-heart beating donors, samples stored in saline, samples treated with antibiotic solution, and finally with cryopreserved valves, stored in liquid nitrogen for months. All samples were dissected, dried with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) method, gold-coated, studied and photographed in scanning electron microscope Tesla BS 301. Different superficial patterns were found on ventricular and vascular surfaces of \"fresh\" semilunar valves. We were able to detect early changes of endothelium after harvesting, denudation of endothelial covering during preservation with and without freezing. Our alternative method of drying samples by HMDS method proved to be suitable for thin membranes of human semilunar valves. Scanning electron microscopy seems to be helpful for morphological control of processing, cryopreservation and liquid nitrogen storage of AHV. We believe that further confrontation of morphological investigation with other methods helps us to develop more suitable protocol of handling AHV in heart valve banking.","625":"The role of intracellular free zinc and its chelation by TPEN (N,N,N',N'- tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylene-diamine) was studied in Bowes human melanoma cells. The content of free Zn pools was determined by fluorescent probe Zinquin. Depletion of zinc triggered apoptosis confirmed by cell blebbing, changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and GSH levels, caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation. Apoptosis was only partially prevented by cyclosporin A or N-acetylcystein, suggesting various independent but likely interrelated mechanisms participating in this process.","626":"Although much has been learned about the pathophysiologic process of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), both diagnostically and therapeutically, since its initial description by Moschowitz in 1924, its etiology and treatments remain, in many instances, problematic. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura remains a rare entity whose etiology is usually unknown, but several drugs and infections have now been implicated in its development. Although treatment by plasma exchange has gained worldwide acceptance, the optimal exchange media is not known, nor the volume and duration of exchange therapy, not appropriate salvage therapies. Without the benefit of randomized controlled trials, its treatment, to a large extent, remains not evidence-based but \"eminence-based\", making the same mistakes with increasing confidence over decades.","627":"Herpes simplex encephalitis is a rare complication of Herpes virus infections. Innate immune mechanisms are the first line of defence encountered by invading infectious agents. A 41-year-old man was admitted to the neurology department with the complaints of fever, headache, vertigo, tinnitus and ataxia. His first brain Magnetic Resonance Imagine showed nodular lesions in the medulla oblongata and the second showed a new left occipital lobe lesion in addition. In sera, Herpes Simplex Virus IgG and M values were positive and liver enzymes were found to be elevated. His diagnosis was Herpes encephalitis with liver involvement. CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD35 receptors were found to be diminished. In this case we want to address that one of the causes of Wallenberg's lateral medullary syndrome can be Herpes simplex virus-1 and probable immune system deficiency can be researched.","628":"The retrospective study was based on 36 open joint surgeries done in 33 consecutive patients with anterior disc dislocation without reduction with severe signs and symptoms and unsuccessful nonsurgical treatment lasting at least 6 months. The patients underwent either discoplasty or discectomy followed by auricular cartilage graft implantation and were evaluated for amount of interincisal mouth opening, severity of pain on VAS scores preoperatively and as well as 12 months postsurgically. The minimum pain levels were preoperatively 50 on VAS for the discoplasty group and 60 on VAS for the discectomy group. After the surgery, the VAS values lower than 20 were reported on 69.4% of 25 sides (72.7% in the discoplasty group, 68.0% in the discectomy group). Using the cutoff point for maximal interincisal opening of more than 35 mm, only 6 patients (16.6%) fulfilled the criterion at the baseline. Interincisal distance measured vertically 12 months after the operation increased in all but five patients. In three of the five subjects, the opening was at the same level as before the surgery. Almost ninety-one percent of the patients (90.9%) in discoplasty group and 81.8% in discectomy group, respectively reached 35 mm or more of vertical opening after the operation. Applying the 1984 Criteria for classification of postoperative results (AAOMS), 12 months after surgery, 24 patients (72.7%) displayed good results, 6 patients (18.2%) were evaluated with acceptable results, and in 3 cases (9.1%) we observed bad results. Although only short-term evaluation is presented, our findings show that both discoplasty and discectomy are effective methods for surgical treatment of patients suffering from severe temporomandibular pain and limited mouth opening. Discoplasty should be reserved only for patients without severe changes of the disc.","629":"To improve the detection rates in the determination of signs consistent with ulcerative cervicitis against signs of intraepithelial neoplasia, in PAP smears. We investigated the frequency of establishing a diagnosis of a simple ulcerative cervicitis by histology in a cohort of 58 females with cervical cytology suggestive of intraepithelial neoplasia. There was found a detection rate of 81.58% in the determination of ulcerative cervicitis by cytology and a rate of 100% in the determination of HPV-infection, CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3 respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between cytology and histology in the diagnosis of ultracerative cervicitis (p&gt;0.5, chi-square). There is an overestimation of the cytological signs in the diagnosis of ulcerative cervicitis 18.42%). There is also an excellent agreement in the diagnosis of HPV-infection and CIN grades (100%) between cytology and histology, discordant with the literature (2.4%-71%). ","630":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and the cause of \"edge restenosis\" after implantation of high activity 41.1 microCi +\/- 1.2 microCi = 1520 kBq +\/- 44 kBq, beta-emitting (55Co) stents. Proton bombarding in cyclotron has brought the radioactivity. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) investigation has been completed in 10 patients. The angiographies performed at 6 month revealed restenosis &gt;50% in 5 cases (50%). The analysis of edges (5 mm distally and proximally to the last stent struts) showed no significant changes in TVV (187.3 +\/- 62.60 mm3 and 176.9 +\/- 53.5 mm3) but PMV increase significantly (i.e. neointimal proliferation) from 61.9 +\/- 31.2 mm3 to 82.2 +\/- 43.4 mm3 (p&lt;0.04) and was the major contributor (from 66%) to lumen volume loss (125.4 +\/- 40.7 mm3 and 94.7 +\/- 22.2 mm3, p&lt;0.02). In conclusion, neither statistically significant positive nor negative remodelling at the \"stent edges\", were present. Statistically significant increase in plaque +\/- media volume (i.e. neointimal hyperplasia) and reduction in lumen volume were found. The cause of \"edge restenosis\" was especially (from 66%) due to increase in plaque +\/- media volume (i.e. neointimal hyperplasia). Probably, main reason for \"edge effect\"\/neointimal hyperplasia was in this trial sharp fall-off in radiation at the edges of the stents.","631":"Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is suggested to be an important enzyme for modulating the bioactivity of insulin, but its clinical significance in diabetes mellitus (DM) is not yet characterized. We measured the serum level of ADA in healthy controls (C, n=29) and type 2 diabetic patients (n=42). The mean serum level of ADA in C, and type 2 diabetic patients was 13.04 +\/- 3.3 and was 22.2 +\/- 4.3 U\/L, respectively (P&lt;0.01[corrected] vs. C). ADA levels of patients were significantly correlated with HbA1c (r=0.45, p&lt;0.01). Our findings suggest that ADA may play a role in insulin effect and glycamic control. On the other hand, increased activity of ADA in type 2 DM might be a marker for insulin indication. However, further studies are required for the pathogenic role of elevated ADA activity in type 2 DM.","632":"Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common cause of hospital admission and COPD patients usually have a long stay in hospital. The objective of this study was to identify factors predicting length of stay in patients with exacerbation of COPD when seen in the emergency room. We analyzed clinical and biological variables. Patients with diminished breath sounds, systolic pressure higher than 140 mmHg, diastolic pressure higher than 90 mmHg and recent previous hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD had the longest hospital stay. Recognition of this clinical profile in the emergency room may help to increase efforts in order to diminish length of stay in these patients. ","633":"To investigate the modification of body composition and level of aerobic capacity in older athletes practicing competitive sport for two years consecutively, 20 elderly male endurance athletes (A) were compared with twenty elderly male subjects who practiced moderate exercise (C). Body composition analysis, physical activity and maximal aerobic power (VO2max) were measured at the beginning of the study, after twelve months and after twenty-four months in both groups. We observed significant differences in group A: body fat was significantly lower in the subjects at the first and second year than at the beginning of the study; fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly higher in the subjects at the first and second year; VO2max in every measurements was significantly higher in the subjects at the at the first and second year than at beginning of the study. Our data suggest that it is possible, even in the elderly, to reach a good level of physical fitness with appropriate training protocols for competitive sport.","634":"Sulphur containing radioprotective drugs amifostine (gammaphos, WR-2721) or cystamine (disulfide of meracaptoethylamine) of Czechoslovak production were examined in whole body fission neutrons irradiated rats in the thermal column of reactor VVR-S. Using the split-dose technic the first sublethal neutron dose in the range 1-2 Gy was followed by second lethal exposures in the two time intervals (3 or 6 days) using whole body fission neutrons irradiations (3 days interval) or whole body gamma-irradiations (6 days interval) for LD50\/30 evaluation within next 30 days survival observation. In other experiments the mean survival time (MST) in days was estimated in different rats group, when animals were whole body fission neutrons irradiated twice with 3-days interval using the total lethal doses of 4 or 5 Gy. Protected rats received amifostine (160 mg.kg(-1) i.p. and 200 mg.kg(-1) i.m.) or cystamine (40 mg.kg(-1) i.p. and 50 mg.kg(-1) i.m.), control rats obtained saline 20 min before beginning of irradiation in the amount of 0.5 ml.100 g(-1) of the rat's body weight. Non-significant DRF value 1.13 for WR-2721 i.p. was calculated in survival studies in rats twice neutron irradiated with 3 days interval (DRF 1.04 for cystamine). Chemical protectors were administered before each neutron exposure. MST of twice neutron lethal iradiated rats was prolonged not regularly by radioprotectors tested. WR-2721 and cystamine i.m. were not able to increase 6 days reparation processes after sublethal 2 Gy fission neutrons whole body irradiated rats.","635":"1. To study the influence of antidotes on tabun-induced neurotoxicity, the rats were injected intramuscularly with organophosphate tabun (LD50). The efficacy of choice antidotal treatment consisting of acetylcholinesterase reactivator obidoxime and one of four anticholinergic drugs (atropine, benactyzine, biperiden, scopolamine) was compared. 2. Testing of tabun-induced neurotoxicity progress was carried out using the method Functional observational battery. The experimental animals as well as controls were observed at 24 hours and 7 days following tabun or saline administration. 3. The results were compared to the condition of animals without anticholinergic drug (oxime alone) and control rats that received physiological solution instead of tabun and treatment. Antidotal treatment involving centrally acting anticholinergic drugs (benactyzine, biperiden, scopolamine) showed significantly higher neuroprotective efficacy compared to antidotal treatment containing atropine.","636":"The blood supply to tissues is reduced as a result of arterial occlusions. Angiogenesis, collateral circulation and reverse flow mechanisms go into operation to restore a continued adequate supply of blood. Ca++ channels undertake the major part of this function. As a result of the increasing tension on the arterial walls, vascular autonomy is affected, and ischemia and even necrosis are observed. Adult 100 male hybrid rabbits were used in this study. The bilateral carotid arteries were ligated at the carotid bifurcation. The rabbits were divided into 2 main groups: treatment and control, and then both groups were further divided into 5 subgroups consisting of 10 rabbits each. The rabbits were sacrificed between the first day and the end of 8 weeks for histopathological examination of the basilar artery in two groups. In control groups, after 24 hours of the occlusion partial swelling and minor endothelial damage were observed in histopathological sections of the basilar artery. Luminal flattening started to decrease, and expanding of the diameter continued. The increase in the diameters of the basilar artery was higher in animals treated by nimodipine, and that difference was statistically significant (P=0,000). This study revealed that the intimal and medial alterations arising from the increased blood flow rate in the basilar artery might be lessened and even partially prevented by the use of nimodipine. ","637":"Polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma of the salivary glands (PLGA) is a low grade neoplasm that predominantly occurs in the minor salivary glands. In this site is amenable to biopsy and histologic diagnosis. However, experience with cytological findings in these tumors is limited. We describe the cytology of this entity. Touch imprint cytology of a primary parotid PLGA is specified and correlated with histology. Smears were hypercellular showing branching papillae, sheets and clusters of uniform cells with bland nuclei, dispersed chromatin and no nucleoli. The cells had a scant to moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. They formed tubular structures containing hyaline globules. The cytologic differential diagnosis of PLGA includes adenoid cystic carcinoma, pleomorphic adenoma, and monomorphic adenoma. PLGA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of head and neck tumors, where the cytology suggests on of the above mentioned tumors, even when the clinical findings (involvement of a major salivary gland, lymph node metastasis) is not typical of PLGA.

In our study, we tried to determine the prevalence of CTS in our consecutive sarcoidosis patients based on their symptoms and nerve conduction study (NCS). Fifty-six patients (mean age: 45.2) who were followed up with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis at our center and who gave informed consent for NCS were included into the study. The patients were questionned for the presence of hand symptoms: paresthesia, pain, nocturnal paresthesia and\/or pain, and, they underwent NCS. Ten (17.9%) patients had recurrent paresthesia, 12 (21.4%) had pain, and 8 (14.3%) had nocturnal paresthesia and\/or pain. The results of NCS showed that 41% of the patients had findings compatible with CTS. Extrapulmonary involvement was significantly more frequent in these patients when compared to patients without CTS (p=0.04). Also, patients with CTS were older than the others and CTS-associated symptoms were more frequent in them although this was not significant (p&gt;0.05). In this study, by performing NCS we detected quite a high prevalence of CTS in our sarcoidosis patients. The fact that most of the patients were asymptomatic was interesting.","642":"The records of the 324 patients with breast cancer; diagnosed and followed in two different University Hospital between years of January 1992 and January 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. The median age of the patients was 49.0+\/-12.5 years, with the range of 18 and 90 years. The most frequently seen age interval of the patients was 40 and 49 years. The most frequently seen symptom and physical examination finding of the patients were breast mass. Breast cancer was diagnosed in 324 women, 173 in the left breast and 151 in the right breast. At the hospital admission percentages of the patients' disease stages were as follows: I (2.8%), IIA (30.0%), IIB (24.0%), IIIA (19.8%), IIIB (11.4) and IV (12.0%). The most frequently seen histopathological diagnosis was infiltrative ductal carcinoma (84.4%). Axillary lymph node metastasis was found in 61.7% of the patients. Primary therapeutic options and percentages were surgical therapy (78.5%), systemic chemotherapy (17.5%) and radiotherapy (4%). Systemic chemotherapy was given to 81.2% of the patients. From the files, estrogen receptor status was known in 311 and positive in 128 (41.2%) of them. Tamoxifen was given patients who had positive estrogen receptor.

BCVA was tested using logMAR chart. CS was examined using VCTS chart in 6 spatial frequencies. Influence of glare was tested using BAT. Patients' subjective visual functions were evaluted using a questionnaire (distance vision, near vision, mesopic vision and glare conditions). 22 subjects were examined as control group. BCVA was 0.52 (0.22-1.05) preoperatively and 0.83 (0.37-1.26) postoperatively. BCVA in patients in both terms was significantly lower compared to the control group. CS in patients before surgery was significantly lower compared to controls, postoperatively improved significantly and was only nonsignificantly lower compared to controls except for the highest spatial frequency. Glare had only nonsignificant influence. The questionnaire scores were correlated with visual performance in both terms. The significant improvement of both BCVA and CS suggest that cataract surgery improves quality of life in early cataract. Questionnaire should be considered as adjuncts to BCVA and CS in evaluating early cataract. ","644":"We evaluated expression of platelet activation markers in blood samples of 15 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) by flow cytometry. Analysis was performed before the beginning of PTCA, during initial coronary angiography and after the end of PTCA or after a stent placement, respectively. We evaluated platelet-derived microparticles, platelet-leukocyte aggregates, platelet aggregates and a membrane expression of CD62P and CD63 molecules. Responsiveness of platelets to the activation in vitro with thrombin-receptor activating protein-6 (TRAP-6) was tested simultaneously. Statistically significant differences between patient samples were found only in the expression of the activation markers CD62P (before PTCA 0.22%, during 0.39%, after 0.67%), CD63 (0.26%\/0.45%\/0.85%) and platelet-leukocyte aggregates (13.57%\/18.39%\/23.63%). In the same group the expression of all constitutive membrane markers was statistically significantly decreased: in patients undergoing PTCA was the expression of CD9: 87.98% (in comparison with control group 94.98%), CD31: 87.10% (92.78%), CD36: 87.37% (90.98%), CD41: 88.09% (95.62%), CD42a: 88.54% (94.98%), CD42a: 88.31% (94.13%).","645":"The maturation of most T-lymphocyte precursors takes place within the meshwork of thymic epithelial cells. Different steps of this process can be defined by immunologic phenotyping. The prothymocytes are positive for the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and give rise to cortical thymocytes, which express CD1, CD2, CD3, CD5, and both CD4 and CD8. These CD4 and CD8 double-positive cortical thymocytes differentiate into two lineages: CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes of the thymic medulla, by the tenth week of gestation. Our study points towards the determination of the CD8 cytotoxic\/suppressor capacity of the fetal thymus in Down's syndrome. A quantitative comparison of T-lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, and CD8) in the thymic parenchyme in embryos after voluntary abortion during 2nd trimester of gestation and embryos with Down's syndrome, respectively, was performed. Our results showed: 1) A statistically significant depletion in the total number of T-cells (CD3 positive) in the cases of embryos with Down's syndrome over those after voluntary abortion, during the second trimester of gestation (p&lt;0.0001, t-test). 2) A significant difference in the CD8\/CD4 ratio in the cases of embryos with Down's syndrome, during the second trimester of gestation which was numerically stronger with the progress of fetal development (20th week: p&lt;0.025; 24th week: p&lt;0.01, chi-square). The occurrence of increased CD8\/CD4 ratio in the cases with Down's syndrome, in the second trimester of gestation, underlines the cytotoxic\/suppressor property of the thymus in the affected fetuses.

Leukemic infiltration of lymph nodes was detected in 12 cases. Liver involvement was present in 19 patients, leukemic infiltration ranged from focal portal and sinusoidal infiltration to massive infiltration that effaced the hepatic architecture. Twelve patients showed leukemic infiltration of the spleen, remaining 9 patients underwent previous splenectomy for massive splenomegaly. We also found leukemic infiltration of kidneys in four cases, two patients showed leukemic involvement of the lungs. The cause of death was related to impaired immunity (sepsis, bronchopneumonia, etc.) in the majority (73%) of cases.","647":"Both cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) are considered to be reliable biomarkers with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for cardiac injury in the majority of laboratory animals. The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of cTnT and cTnI in three groups of rabbits: 1) control (saline 1 ml\/kg i.v.); 2) Salicylaldehyde Isonicotinoyl Hydrazone--SIH (50 mg\/kg, once weekly, i.p.; partially dissolved in 10% Cremophor solution); 3) 10% Cremophor solution in water (2 ml\/kg i.v.). The drugs were given once a week, 10 administrations. The concentration of cTnT was measured using Elecsys Troponin T STAT Immunoassay (Roche). The concentration of cTnI was measured using AxSYM Troponin I (Abbott). The linear regression model was applied to see if there is a dependence between cTnT and cTnI. The coefficient of determination was not acceptable in all groups. The highest value of R2 was found in the control group (R2 = 0.424). We may conclude that in rabbits meaningful dependence between cTnT and cTnI was not found. According to our long-term experiences cTnT seems to be more suitable cardiomarker in rabbits in comparison with cTnI where the data are characterized by the large scatter.","648":"Salicylaldehyde Isonicotinoyl Hydrazone (SIH)--a Pyridoxal Isonicotinoyl Hydrazone (PIH) analogue--is an effective iron chelator with antioxidant and antimalarial effects, as documented in numerous in vitro studies. However, no toxicological data obtained from in vivo studies have been made available yet. In this study, the potential toxic effects of repeated administration of SIH (50 mg\/kg, once weekly, 10 weeks, i.p.), partially dissolved in a 10% Cremophor solution, on various biochemical, haematological, and cardiovascular parameters and on morphology of selected tissues were investigated in rabbits. The obtained values were compared with data from the control (saline, 1 ml\/kg, i.v.) and the Cremophor (10% Cremophor solution, 2 ml\/kg, i.p.) groups. In this study, SIH did not induced marked signs of toxicity: No premature deaths occurred, the body weight increase was comparable with the control and Cremophor groups. Only few and mild changes in some biochemical and haematological parameters could be determined, most of them were noticed also in the control or Cremophor groups. The morphological changes in the kidney were mild and did not manifest in the biochemical examination. The cardiac function was also not affected markedly--the values of left ventricular ejection fraction and systolic time interval did not differ from the values of control group. Only an increased left ventricular contractility (dP\/dtmax) was noticed in the SIH group at the end of the experiment as compared to the controls (13,354+\/-1191 vs. 9339+\/-647 mmHg\/s, resp.). These results seem to be promising from the standpoint of possible clinical use of SIH.","649":"The developed inhalation system is a dynamic and whole-body exposure model designated for generating sarin or soman vapors. It consists of an evaporating apparatus, an inhalation chamber and a carbon filter. The inhalation chamber is made of stainless steel and its total volume is 36 l. The concentration of organophosphorus compound depends on airflow through the chamber, syringe volume of the dosing pump and dosing speed. For determination of organophosphorus compound (OPC) concentration, a modification of Ellman method is used. At generating of vapors in the inhalation chamber the means of the yield were 61.4 +\/- 6.6% for sarin and 35.8 +\/- 3.5% for soman. The better yield for sarin than for soman, because of the higher volatility of sarin in comparison with soman was achieved. The stable concentration of the OPC for several hours could be maintained in the inhalation chamber when only relatively small amount of the OPC is used. Using the developed inhalation system LCt50 for sarin and for soman in rats was determined. At 1 h exposure the LCt50 values were 4.72 mg x h(-1) x m(-3) for sarin and 4.81 mg x h(-1) x m(-3) for soman. The results presented show that the inhalation chamber successfully fulfils the role of instrument for inhalation intoxication of small laboratory animals with highly toxic OPC.","650":"To study the effects of stress on cognitive functions, Wistar and Lewis rats were exposed to restraint (immobilization stressor) (IMO) or restraint combined with partial immersion into water (IMO+C). Learned discriminatory avoidance response in Y-maze, with foot-shock as an unconditioned stimulus, was used as a memory test. The latency to enter the correct arm and number of wrong entries were daily recorded during the training period (20 days) until the criterion was reached, which was set at 90% avoidances (choosing the correct arm). After exposure of rats to one of the stressors for 60 min, the rats were returned to the home cage; the latency to enter the safe arm was recorded in 6 daily trials that started 1 h after application of stressor. Both stressors significantly prolonged the avoidance latencies for 2 or 3 days in Wistar and Lewis rats, respectively; then the latencies returned to the values obtained before the stress exposure. In Lewis rats, the latencies more increased after IMO+C than after IMO stressor, and the maximal increase in latencies was higher in Lewis rats than in Wistar rats. The latency did not reach the time limit for foot-shock delivery, and the number of correct choices remained unchanged in both strains. The results indicate that the used restraint stressors did not affect the long-term memory; rather a transient impairment of retrieval can be considered. Further, differences in response of Lewis and Wistar rats may be interpreted by different activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in used strains.","651":"Possible in vitro inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAD, EC 4.1.1.28) by a group of phenylsulfonylbenzoic acid derivatives VUFB 19363, 19369, 19370, 19371, and 19760 as new potential anti-inflammatory compounds was studied using the substrate L-tyrosine. Enzyme inhibition by 2.7 x 10(-5) M concentration of compound VUFB 19363 (Quinlukast) was 17%, AAD inhibition at 3.75 x 10(-5) M concentration of compounds VUFB 19369, 19370, 19371, and 19760 ranged between 9-23%. There were distinct differences between individual compounds. Evaluation of inhibition kinetics suggested full reversibility with VUFB 19369 and the uncompetitive type of inhibition in the case of compound VUFB 19363. Considering the anti-inflammatory activity of the compounds studied, the weak AAD inhibition found is rather favourable for their prospective pharmacological effect.","652":"Chromium acetate hydroxide is a chemical form of trivalent chromium (Cr III) originating from industrial processes. Although considered relatively nontoxic, upon longer treatment intervals it may cause irreversible cellular damage culminating in cell death. In our present work we have attempted to analyze some of the mechanisms whereby this chemical inflicts damage while focusing on the final observed endpoints. We report that 1 mM chromium acetate hydroxide is during weeks lasting treatment capable of injuring the plasma membrane of Hep-2 cells, which in turn becomes permeable to Cr (III) ions. Analyses of several markers of cellular damage; i.e. mitochondrial activity, nuclear integrity and oxidative stress have shown that tested compound interacts directly with subcellular organelles and upon tested concentration and time induces distinct type of cell death bearing features of apoptosis and necrosis.","653":"Regulatory T cells have emerged as an important mechanism of regulating tolerance and T cell responses. CD4+ regulatory T cells can be divided into two main groups, natural regulatory T cells, which express high levels of CD25 on their cell surface and phenotypically diverse adaptive (antigen induced) regulatory T cells. Natural regulatory T cells are made in the thymus, and require strong costimulatory signals for induction and maintenance, express a transcription factor called Foxp3, and function by a largely unknown mechanism. Adaptive (antigen induced) regulatory T cells are made by sub-optimal antigenic signals in the periphery, in the presence of immunosuppressive cytokines, often in special circumstances, such as chronic viral infections or after mucosal administration of antigen, and rely on cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-beta for suppression. Regulatory T cells offer a great potential for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and during transplantation.","654":"A different tumor concurrence of the uterine body is usually encountered as a coincidence of leiomyoma and endometrial cancer. Pure lipomatous tumors or fatty change in the leiomyoma or endometrium are rare affections with some diagnostic peculiarities. We present a case of association of the pure uterine lipoma, leiomyoma, and endometrial cancer as a tumor triplicity, which may contribute, to the pathogenesis of mesenchymal tumors in this location.","655":"The group G streptococcal endocarditis is a rare form of infective endocarditis. In this form of infective endocarditis, serious neurological complications most commonly develop. We reported this case because of its being an unusual form of infective endocarditis that was caused by Group G Streptococcus. We also reviewed the literature. The patient was admitted to infectious disease service with a presumptive diagnosis of central nervous system infection. Blood cultures were positive for group G streptococcus. There was a mass on the posterior surface of the mitral valve which was 2 x 2.5 cm in length on the echocardiography. In the cranial computerized tomography of our patient, slightly increased contrast media uptake was observed in the both parietal lobes, in the both frontal lobes, and in the anterior areas of right occipital lobe. Therefore, this case was assumed as infective endocarditis caused by group G streptococcus with multiple cerebral emboli. Ceftriaxone was given for 4 weeks and gentamicin was given for 2 weeks, and progressive improvement of the patient's condition was seen.","656":"In this report the case of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (angiotropic lymphoma, intravascular angioendotheliomatosis, malignant endotheliomatosis) with panniculitis features is present. The diagnosis was based on finding of typical CD20 positive tumorous cells within capillaries, veins, and small arteries in the biopsy of subcutaneous adipose tissue. An accurate and early diagnosis together with combined chemotherapy resulted in good response and remission of the disease.","657":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of traction in achieving closed reduction of a dislocated hip. We evaluated 38 hips in 29 consecutive patients who had been treated at our department between January 1999 and December 2001. There were 26 girls and 3 boys and the average age was 8 weeks. The minimal duration of follow-ups was 12 months after closed reduction. We achieved 32 concentricaly reduced hips, the barriers to the concentric reduction were demonstrated by arthrography in 5 hips an 1 hip redislocated after removal of the spica cast. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head developed in no conservatively treated hip. The traction reduction method is preferred at our department because of high rate of success without damaging the femoral head.","658":"The aim of this study is to present our experience with two-stage reimplantation in the management of the infected hip arthroplasty. Between January 1993 and December 2001 the replacement of the total hip arthroplasty in two stages was performed in 18 patients. There were 7 male and 11 female patients and the average age was 62 years. The mean follow-up after revision was 3.5 years. The mean postoperative Harris Hip Score averaged 78 (50-96) points. None of 18 patients had a recurrence of the infection. Two-stage reconstruction of the infected hip is preferred to one-stage exchange arthroplasty at our department because of higher rate of eradication of the infection.","659":"The effect of methoxime combined with a) atropine, b) benactyzine, c) atropine and natrium thiosulphate, d) atropine and diazepam on antidotal treatment effectiveness was studied in tabun-poisoned mice. In addition, the influence of pretreatment consisiting of pyridostigmine, benactyzine and trihexyphenidyle (PANPAL) administered 2 hours before tabun intoxication on the treatment effectivity of methoxime combined with e) atropine or f) benactyzine was tested. The most efficacious therapeutic mixture in non-pretreated mice was methoxime, atropine and diazepam. Natrium thiosulphate did not significantly increase neither decrease the antidotal treatment efficacy in comparison with methoxime and atropine alone. Pretreatment with PANPAL significantly decreased tabun toxicity (nearly 4 times in methoxime and benactyzine combination and more than 4 times in atropine and methoxime mixture). The present study demonstrates that the tabun toxicity in mice is more effectively reduced when PANPAL prophylactically is administered than in case of treatment with methoxime and cholinergic drug alone. We established that anticholinergic drug option in the therapeutic mixture of methoxime and anticholinergic drug did not cause the difference in the antidotal treatment effectivities.","660":"1. To study the influence of pharmacological pretreatment (PANPAL or pyridostigmine combined with biperiden) and antidotal treatment (the oxime HI-6 plus atropine) on soman-induced neurotoxicity, male albino rats were poisoned with a lethal dose of soman (54 (g\/kg i.m.; 100% of LD50 value) and observed at 24 hours and 7 days following soman challenge. The neurotoxicity of soman was evaluated using a Functional observational battery and an automatic measurement of motor activity. 2. Pharmacological pretreatment as well as antidotal treatment were able to eliminate some of soman-induced neurotoxic effects observed at 24 hours following soman poisoning. The combination of pharmacological pretreatment (PANPAL or pyridostigmine combined with biperiden) and antidotal treatment was found to be more effective in the elimination of soman-induced neurotoxicity in rats at 24 hours following soman challenge in comparison with the administration of pharmacological pretreatment or antidotal treatment alone. To compare both pharmacological pretreatments, the combination of pyridostigmine with biperiden seems to be more efficacious to eliminate soman-induced signs of neurotoxicity than PANPAL. 3. At 7 days following soman poisoning, the combination of pharmacological pretreatment involving pyridostigmine and biperiden with antidotal treatment was only able to completely eliminate soman-induced neurotoxic signs. 4. Thus, our findings confirm that the combination of pharmacological pretreatment and antidotal treatment is able not only to protect the experimental animals from the lethal effects of soman but also to eliminate most soman-induced signs of neurotoxicity in poisoned rats. The pharmacological pretreatment containing pyridostigmine and biperiden appears to be more efficacious to eliminate soman-induced neurotoxic sings than PANPAL.","661":"Isolated human peripheral lymphocytes were treated in vitro with styrene-7, 8-oxide (SO) and the kinetics of the repair of induced DNA damage was assessed by comet assay during further incubation of lymphocytes. Using a modified assay we measured simultaneously the number of single strand breaks in DNA (SSBs) and the sites sensitive to endonuclease III (endo III) that most probably represent abasic sites in DNA molecules. SO induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner and both SSBs and endo III sites were removed from the DNA by a repair process with a half time about 2-4 hours. The damage was repaired completely within 12 hours after the treatment.","662":"Early childhood caries (ECC) represents a serious problem in pediatric dentistry. Not only because of its rapidity but also because of age of affected children. This has been given different names such as \"rampant caries\" and \"baby bottle syndrome\" but now all clinical manifestations have been joined and classified as early childhood caries. The topic of this article is the prevalence, etiology, clinical manifestations and preventive measures of ECC.","663":"The publication provides an up-to-date review of the significance of cytogenetic abnormalities in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and the development of a promising agent with specific molecular target against tyrosine kinase, product of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, namely imatinib mesylate (STI 571, Glivec). The publication summarizes the achieved results with this compound in the chronic phase CML (in patients resistant to interferon and in newly diagnosed patients) further in patients in the accelerated phase and in blast crisis and in patients in relapse after allogeneic stem cells transplantations for CML. The results in Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia are also presented. The mechanisms of resistance to imatinib mesylate and the possibilities how to overcome or circumvent it are mentioned (escalation of the dosage, combination of imatinib with some other treatment modalities as immunotherapy, interferon or convention chemotherapy and development of new drugs).","664":"The head and neck surgeon's fascination with parotid surgery arises from the gland's spectrum of histopathological presentations, as well as the diversity of its morphological features. A mass arising in the mid-cheek region may often be overlooked as a rare accessory lobe parotid neoplasm. This report serves to revisit the topic of accessory parotid gland neoplasms to emphasize proper management, particularly the surgical aspects, so that consequences of salivary fistula, facial nerve paralysis, and recurrence are avoided. We report a case of mucoepidermoid carcinoma which was assessed pre-operatively as arising from the accessory parotid gland of a 11-year-old female. She had complained of a painless and round mass of the left cheek for a duration of 12 months. Sialography, ultrasonography, CT scan and MRI were performed preoperatively. Sialography revealed a small duct separating from the Stensen's duct. CT and MRI showed that the tumor with smooth outline was lying on the masseter muscle and detached from the main parotid gland. The preoperative diagnosis was an accessory parotid gland tumor. The tumor was removed without facial nerve injury via standard parotidectomy incision. The tumor was composed of mucous, intermediate and epidermoid cells. The pathological diagnosis was low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Accessory parotid gland neoplasms are rare and may present as innocuous extraparotid mid-cheek masses. A high index of suspicion, prudent diagnostic skills (including fine-needle aspiration [FNA] biopsy followed by computed tomography [CT] imaging), and scrupulous surgical approach (extended parotidectomy-style incision and limited peripheral nerve dissection when possible) are the keys to successful management of these lesions. ","665":"Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is widely used in the treatment of end stage renal failure patients. Delayed injury to the bowel is an uncommon complication of CAPD catheter. In this article, we presented a case of bowel perforation during catheter removal after the sixth month of peritoneal dialysis termination.","666":"Pediculosis humanus capitis (head lice) is an important public health problem among school children. In our study, 20,612 schoolchildren (10,367 boys, 10,245 girls) were examined for Pediculus humanus capitis in 36 elementary schools between December 1996 and February 1998 in Ankara, Turkey. The prevalence of pediculosis capitis infestation was found to be 3.4% (701\/20,612). Of these, 382 students were treated with application of 1% permethrin cream rinse, and 184 students with 0.4% d-phenothrin shampoo. On day 14 of the controlled trial, the success rates were 93.7% in the 1% permethrin cream rinse group and 75.5% in the 0.4% d-phenothrin shampoo group. The 1% permethrin cream rinse was also significantly more active in pediculicidal efficacy when compared to the 0.4% d-phenothrin shampoo (p&lt;0.001). As a result, these findings demonstrate that pediculosis capitis still remains a widespread health problem.","667":"Lead is a health hazard for all humans. Especially children under the age of six are most at risk for lead poisoning. Lead toxicity causes hematological, gastrointestinal, and neurological dysfunction. Symptoms are usually noted with blood lead greater than 2 micromoles\/L. Severe or prolonged exposure may also cause chronic nephropathy, hypertension, and reproductive impairment. Lead inhibits some enzymes, alters cellular calcium metabolism, stimulates synthesis of binding proteins in kidney, brain, and bone, and slows down nerve conduction. Acute lead poisoning is relatively infrequent and results from ingestion of acid soluble lead compounds or inhalation of lead vapors but chronic exposure to low levels of the metal is still a public health issue, especially among some minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Lead has been used since prehistoric times, and has become widely distributed and mobilized in the environment. Exposure to and uptake of this non-essential element have consequently increased. Both occupational and environmental exposures to lead remain a serious problem in many developing and industrializing countries and a public health problem of global dimensions.","668":"We described a 67 years old small-cell lung cancer patient with a prior history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who was treated with successful chemotherapy. It is probably safe to administer chemotherapeutic agents for some cancer patients with prior history of ITP, but it is important to prevent or minimize the toxicities of these chemotherapeutic agents.","669":"Many of epidemiological studies have certified the relationship between welding and various forms of health damages. In our study we performed an immunological research within a group of twenty men, working in the risky environment of manufacturing of stainless steel constructions (11 welders and 9 grinders, average age was 31 years, 55% of smokers, average time period in welding occupational exposure was 8 years). The exposed group of men was compared with a group of healthy blood donors, marked as the control group (people with various types of employment, living in same locality as a people from exposed group). People within the control group were not occupationally exposed to harmful chemical compounds (from 30 to 100 men were chosen for the individual immune parameters, average age of the whole group was 38 years, 40% of smokers). When compared with the control group, the exposed group of welders and grinders showed higher level of C3 complement (p &lt; 0.001), orosomucoid (p &lt; 0.05), beta-2-microglobulin (p &lt; 0.001), neopterin (p &lt; 0.001) and all fagocytic cells (p &lt; 0.001). On the contrary, in the group of exposed people decreased values of IgA (p &lt; 0.001), IgG (p &lt; 0.001), IgM (p &lt; 0.001), transferin (p &lt; 0.001), alpha-1-antitrypsin (p &lt; 0.001), alpha-2-macroglobulin (p &lt; 0.001), haptoglobulin (p &lt; 0.001) and ceruloplasmin (p &lt; 0.05) were found. Some of these changes were characteristic for the exposed group. They could be considered as precursors of biological markers of effect for given type of exposure.","670":"The welding processes belong among the important sources of occupational pollutions. The welding fumes are ranked, according to the classification of IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), into the group of 2B. In our study we have performed the investigation of twenty men (exposed group) working in the stainless steel welding industrial processes (11 welders and 9 grinders, average age was 31 years, 55% of smokers, average time period of welding occupational exposure was 8 years). The concentrations of chromium (0.557-16.343 mg\/m3) and nickel (0.340-10.129 mg\/m3) in occupational atmosphere highly exceeded established values of maximum permitted concentrations (0.1 and 1.0 mg\/m3, respectively). The concentrations of manganese did not exceed its permitted values. Total concentrations of 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in occupational atmosphere varied from 300.9 to 961.2 ng\/m3. For purposes of biological monitoring, the levels of chromosomal aberrations were determined in the exposed and control group. Healthy blood donors servedas a control group. People from that group were not occupationally exposed to harmful chemical compounds (20 men, average age was 36 years, 40% of smokers). Increased level of chromosomal aberrations of exposed group brought the evidence about higher genotoxic risk of investigated welding processes.","671":"This study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of sinus mucosa perforation occurred during maxillary sinus mucosa elevation surgery, its relation to objective conditions and to the causative medical history, and its influence on postoperative sinusitis, as well. One hundred and forty-six sinus lift procedures have been evaluated in 118 patients. The prevalence of the sinus mucosa perforation was evaluated and subdivided into four groups according to its size and way of treatment. No relation was observed between the perforation and the presence of sinus septa, smoking, radiographic thickening and cyst-like lesions of the maxillary sinus, and previous sinus allergy (P &lt; 0.05). Despite of high prevalence of the perforation of the mucosa (56.16%), no signs of bone graft infection or maxillary sinusitis were noted in any of our patient.","672":"To compare effect of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) on contrast sensitivity (CS) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in high myopia. 38 myopes (PRK) and 31 patients (LASIK) were examined before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Mean preoperative spherical equivalent was -8.0 +\/- 1.7D (PRK) and -9.2 +\/- 2.1D (LASIK). CS was tested on a computerized system of the Contrast Sensitivity 8010 Type at 6 spatial frequencies (0.74 and 29.55 c\/deg), BCVA was measured on logMAR charts. At 12 months postoperatively, mean spherical equivalent was -0.6 +\/- 1.0D (PRK) and -1.0 +\/- 0.8D (LASIK). Postoperative values of CS were significantly higher in the PRK group, except for spatial frequencies of 3.69 and 7.39 c\/deg up to 3 months postoperatively. The initial significant decrease of BCVA lasted up to 6 months after PRK. In the LASIK group BCVA was not significantly different from its preoperative level at the 3-months follow-up. The significant improvement of CS after PRK suggest that PRK can improve quality of vision in eyes with high myopia. Although recovery of BCVA after LASIK was faster than after PRK, there may be a persistent decrease in CS. ","673":"To determine the immunoreactivity of pancreatic-polypeptide (PP) during the development of the human fetal pancreas and ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma, given that, PP positive cells were demonstrated either into its embryonic anlage or into pancreatic cancer. Tissue sections from 15 pancreatic fetal specimens, and equal number of ductal adenocarcinoma specimens, were assessed. The density of positive cells in the primitive exocrine ductal epithelium and endocrine epithelium was significantly higher than the relevant density in the neoplastic pancreatic tissue of mixed (ductal - endocrine) and pure ductal type (p1 = 0.001, p2 &lt; 0.0005, p3 = 0.046 and p4 &lt; 0.0005 respectively). The above values were estimated during the 10th to 12th week. There was no significant difference in the density of positive cells in the mantle zone of the islets from the 13th to the 24th week, and the neoplastic tissue of mixed (p5 = 0.11) and pure ductal type (p6 = 0.23). The immunostaining for PP identifies a subgroup of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas with a neuroendocrine component, initially considered as pure ductal tumors, and mixed ductal and neuroendocrine tumors. This pattern of expression in neoplasms recapitulates the normal pattern during the embryonal development of the organ, raising the question of therapeutic efficacy of PP and analogues as potential adjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer. ","674":"The extracorporeal elimination of LDL-cholesterol could be performed using the classic non-selective centrifuge or membrane plasmapheresis. The modern methods are more selective and effective. The atherogenic particules are removed from plasma by active colon or capsula. The methods include: cascade filtration, imunoadsorbtion, heparin-induced precipitation of LDL, thermofiltration, dextran-induced precipitation of LDL and direct adsorption of lipids (DALI). The regular LDL-apheresis is the life-saving technique in the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. It is used in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia when the patients do not respond to diet and drugs therapy, too. The regular LDL-apheresis treatment may be followed by the decreased frequency of angina pain episodes, the reduction of ECG changes during the bicycle ergometry and significant disappearance of tendinous xantomas. Some prospective randomised studies has shown even in this group of patients, resistant to conventional treatment, a significant regression of atherosclerotic changes.","675":"We report a man aged 68 years old with pneumothorax and chronic bilateral pleural effusion in association with a history of yellow nails. The diagnosis of yellow nail syndrome based on yellow nails, lymphedema, chronic pleural effusion and intestinal lymphangiectasia.","676":"To determine whether low dose ketoconazole (KTZ) has antithyroid action, we studied thyroid function tests in the 13 rats treated with KTZ (20 mg\/kg twice daily) for thirty days. Serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels were decreased (P&lt;0.05) and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were mildly increased (P&gt;0.05) at the end of treatment. Histopathological analysis of the thyroid glands demonstrated an increase in cylindrical cells in study group, but the epithelial cells were mainly cubical in control group. These findings showed that low dose KTZ had antithyroid effect in rats. The responsible mechanisms may be direct effect of the drug on thyroid gland.","677":"The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of panoramic radiography in identification of maxillary sinus septa. Out of 68 sinuses were radiographically examined using both panoramic and computerized tomographic radiographs (CT scan). Using CT scan, 24 (35.9%) out of 68 cases maxillae showed at least one septum, 22 sinuses (32.3%) showed one septum, whereas two sinuses (2.9%) exhibited two septa. Panoramic radiograph led to a false diagnosis regarding the presence or absence of sinus septa in 18 of 68 sinuses (26.5%). On the other hand, they gave negative diagnosis of sinus septa in 12 of 24 septa (50%). There was fully agreement between the two methods (positive septa) only in 12 of 24 septa (50%). We cannot depend on panoramic radiograph for the detection of sinus septa because it can lead to false or negative results.","678":"The objective of this clinical study was to determine the predictability of endosseous implant placed in a maxillary sinus augmented with deproteinized bovine bone (Bio-Oss). A total of 185 implants (109 titanium and 76 hydroxyapatite-coated) were placed in 77 patients representing 92 sinuses either a one- or two-stage surgical technique. A mixture of venous patient's blood and Bio-Oss was used alone within 20 sinuses (Group 1), or in combination with autogenous bone within 72 sinuses (Group 2). Thirty-nine implants were placed in Group 1 and 147 implants were inserted in Group 2. The grafted sinuses were evaluated clinically and radiographically at second stage surgery. According to certain criteria, of the implants placed, only two titanium implants (1.08%) failed with 98.91% implant survival. There was no statistically variable difference for the use of hydroxyapatite-coated or titanium implants. The two failed implants were from Group 2. No clinical benefit has been achieved from the combination with autogenous bone (P&lt;0.05). All the grafted sinuses were sufficient to place dental implants of at least 12 mm length (100% graft success). The results of this short-term study support the hypothesis that Bio-Oss can be a suitable material for sinus augmentation.","679":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the keystone role of paediatric general practitioners (PGPs) in our system of photoscreening of amblyogenic factors at children younger one year. The parental involvement on the participation of their children at photoscreening was also analysed. From June 2000 to February 2001 we have performed 780 photoscreening tests of children aged from 3 months to 31 months (mean age 9.7 months). The photoscreening test was voluntary. Parents was invited to visit screening center by PGP's recommendation and by offering the Invitation\/information brochure. The brochure was distributed by 56 paediatric general practitioners during obligatory examinations at 5., 8. resp. 12. month of age from June to November 2000. Based on the questionnaire (return rate 89%) we documented following data: the number of children of particular age in the care of PGPs was 2060, 1458 Invitation\/information brochures was distributed by PGPs. PGPs attended for more children at particular age distributed relatively less number of brochures if compared to PGPs with lower number of relative children. The willingness to the photoscreening programe participance of parents of children belonging to PGPs attended our educational seminary exhibited independence on distance between PGP office and our department in the strong contrast to families belonging with PGPs not participating on educational programme. Our further effort on elevating the percentage of children population participation on screening must be focused on education of PGP with large number of children at particular age and on ensuring the issuing of brochures or other forms of invitation at PGPs' offices.","680":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level measurement in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD) that can be shown angiographically. CRP levels were determined in the blood of 198 patients (patients group, PG) with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and compared with that of 85 patients (control group, CG) who had a clinical indication for coronary angiography but have no angiographically determined coronary artery stenosis, as well as with that of 41 healthy volunteers as a healthy control group (HG) who did not have any complaint and did not have coronary angiography. CRP levels were measured 24 hours prior to angiography in PG and CG patients, and in the morning after not having eaten for same time. Any coronary artery stenosis or plaque formation was defined as CAD. Severity of the disease was assessed by both the number of diseased vessels (0 to 3) and the degree of stenosis (&lt;50% mild, 50-70% moderate and &gt;70% severe). Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves of CRP in angiographically documented CAD group showed a diagnostic value of 0.659 in female patients, followed by 0.542 in male patients, in predicting CAD. CRP levels were found to be significantly different between groups, higher in PG (6.2 +\/- 0.86 mg\/L) than those of CG (3.7 +\/- 0.92 mg\/L) and HG (0.854 +\/- 0.2 mg\/L) (p&lt;0.05). CRP levels were not associated with the number of diseased vessels, neither with the degree of the occlusion (p&gt;0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustment for the established coronary risk factors showed CRP as an independent discriminating risk factor for CAD. It is concluded that CRP measurement has a value in predicting the presence of angiographically documented CAD. However, CRP levels were not associated with the degree or severity of CAD. ","681":"1. To study the influence of antidotes on low-level sarin-induced impairment of cognitive functions, the rats were exposed to three various low concentrations of sarin (LEVEL 1-3) for 60 minutes in the inhalation chamber. In addition, one group of rats was exposed to LEVEL 2 of sarin repeatedly. 2. Testing of cognitive functions was carried out using the Y-maze evaluating learning and spatial memory. The correct averse behavior of sarin-exposed rats in the Y-maze was tested several times within four weeks following sarin inhalation exposure and antidotal treatment to look for any cognitive impairments. 3. The results were compared to the Y-maze performance of sarin-exposed rats without antidotal treatment and control rats exposed to pure air instead of sarin with or without antidotal treatment. While antidotal treatment was able to eliminate a short-term deficiency in the Y-maze performance in rats exposed to the LEVEL 1 of sarin, a significant decrease in the Y-maze performance in rats exposed to sarin at the LEVEL 2 and 3 was only shortened. Sarin-induced spatial memory impairments in rats exposed repeatedly to sarin at the LEVEL 2 was also shortened when rats were treated following each sarin inhalation exposure. 4. The findings confirm that antidotes currently used for nerve agent poisonings are beneficial for the treatment of rats singly or repeatedly exposed to non-convulsive symptomatic or even clinically asymptomatic concentrations of sarin.","682":"The aim of this work is a comparison of single and repeated peroral administration of cyclosporine (CsA) and the interaction of repeated administration of CsA and 7-methoxytacrine (MEOTA) on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, septum, and basal ganglia in rats. Both single and repeated administration of CsA diminished the activity of AChE in the frontal cortex, septum and basal ganglia, while the enzyme activity in the hippocampus was diminished only in the case of repeated CsA, as well as repeated CsA + MEOTA administration. Repeated administration of CsA led to a further augmentation of anticholinesterase activity only in the frontal cortex and--in a lesser extent--in the basal ganglia. No augmentation of AChE activity was observed in the hippocampus and septum.","683":"Many experiments have demonstrated that some cell lines are resistant to chemically induced apoptosis in vitro, and that apoptosis itself is far from being a homogenous phenomenon. Here we show that 10 microg\/ml etoposide elicited only minor changes in Bowes human melanoma cells (temporary decrease in cell viability and proliferation, transient phospatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 activation), which weren't clearly capable to start apoptotic pathway in the entire treated population. On the other hand, potassium chromate at concentration of 150 microg\/ml executed cell death bearing some features of apoptosis (cell blebbing, caspase-3 activation and cytoskeletal changes) but lacking or showing weakly others (DNA fragmentation and phospatidylserine externalization). Our results suggest that in detecting apoptosis several fault-proof detection systems are to be used to avoid misleading results and conclusions in each experimental setting.","684":"In addition to the main groups of inherited metabolic diseases, including mitochondrial, peroxisomal and lysosomal defects, organic acidurias, porphyrias, defects of amino acids, saccharides and fatty acids metabolism, disorders of transport and utilisation of microelements have also been recognized. Recent findings concerning hereditary hemochromatosis (iron), Wilson and Menkes diseases (copper), molybdenum cofactor deficiency (molybdenum), defects of cobalamine synthesis (cobalt) and acrodermatitis enteropathica (zinc) are reviewed.","685":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants, distinguished by genotoxic, hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic and immunotoxic effects. Especially secondary toxicity after bioactivation by microsomal monooxygenases (dependent on cytochromes P450) is characteristic of them. The immunotoxic effect is the result of very global impact on immunological reactivity of an organism and immunosuppression by induction of apoptosis of pre-B lymphocytes represents one of its particular forms. It has been proved that the effect of PAH is caused mostly by the following mechanisms: enzymatic induction by the way of activation of AhR (Aromatic hydrocarbon Receptor); alteration of cellular DNA; development of oxidative stress; increase in the concentration of intercellular calcium and decline of activity of NF-kappaB (Nuclear Factor-kappa B). Most sensitive to these changes are particularly B-lymphocytic precursors and pre-B lymphocytes. Intensity of entire manifestations is also considerably dependent on the presence and intensity of mechanisms of active or passive resistance of cells.","686":"Concomittant severe coronary artery disease and lung malignancies occur rarely. Combined conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with lung resection posses several perioperative and postoperative problems related to extracorporeal circulation and heparinization. The avoidance of CPB may be advantageous by decreasing blood loss, pulmonary complications and hospital stay. Further, exposure to the immunosuppressive and inflammatory effects of CPB may have deleterious impact on tumor growth and dissemination. Off-pump CABG makes the combined procedure safer as it abolishes the complications of CPB. We report two patients with the diagnosis of severe coronary artery disease and lung malignancies, underwent off-pump CABG and lung resections in the same surgical setting.","687":"This study was undertaken to compare implant survival after one- or two-stage sinus augmentation. Ninety-two maxillary sinuses in 77 patients were augmented with deproteinized bovine bone (Bio-Oss). These sinuses were sub-divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 49) was operated on with a one-stage procedure, and Group 2 (n = 43) with a two-stage operation. A hundred and eighty-five implants were inserted in these augmented sinuses. Clinical and radiographical evaluations were performed and recorded according to certain criteria. The follow-up period was ranging from 16 to 44 months. Out of the implants inserted using the one-stage procedure, all survived. Two implants failed in the two-stage procedure group (98.91% implant survival). This study showed that no statistically significance was observed between the two surgical techniques (P &lt; 0.05). Therefore, the authors concluded the type of surgical procedure (one- or two-stage) has no effect on implant survival.","688":"In this article, we studied complete blood count, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL-6) levels in 30 newborn infants with sepsis at admission, in the 24th hour of admission and at the end of the treatment. Our purpose was to determine the relationship among these parameters in the early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. In our study, there was not a significant difference in white blood cell (WBC) and thrombocyte count among the values of the first, 24th hour and end of therapy in the study group (P &gt; 0.05). However, there was not a significant difference in B\/N ratio among the values at admission, 24th hour and end of therapy in the study group (P &gt; 0.05). Both serum CRP and IL-6 levels were found to be significantly higher than those of control subjects at the beginning (P &lt; 0.05). Similarly, the values obtained on the 24th hour were also elevated. However, at the end of therapy both decreased to normal level (P &lt; 0.05). Based on these data, we think that serum CRP levels only which is a simple method may be used in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. However, WBC and serum IL-6 levels may be useful to establish mortality, because there was a statistically significant difference for these parameters between the survivors and deaths (P &lt; 0.05).","689":"1. To study the influence of antidotes on low-level sarin-induced alteration of cognitive functions, male albino Wistar rats were exposed to three various low concentrations of sarin for 60 minutes in the inhalation chamber. One minute following sarin exposure, the rats were i.m. treated with the oxime HI-6 in combination with atropine. Control rats were treated with antidotes as experimental rats but exposed to the pure air instead of sarin. Cognitive functions of the rats were tested using a T-maze where spatial memory and spatial orientation were evaluated. The performance of sarin-exposed and treated rats in the T-maze was tested several times within six weeks (single exposure) or five weeks (repeated exposure) following inhalation exposure to evaluate cognitive impairments. 2. In the case of single exposure to sarin, no statistically significant differencies between the performances of the control and the experimental groups in the alteration of spatial memory and spatial orientation were observed. The repeated exposure of treated rats to clinically asymptomatic dose of sarin (LEVEL 2) did not change the effect of low-level sarin exposure on spatial memory of the experimental rats compared to the single exposure to the same dose of sarin. 3. The decrease in the T-maze performance of the control rats was caused by the impairments of rat's mobility due to the features of a solution of antidotes.","690":"A possible protective action of DMPS (a dithiol chelating agent) against chronic daunorubicin toxicity in rabbits in comparison with dexrazoxane was investigated. The rabbits were divided into five groups: control (saline, 1 ml\/kg i.v.), daunorubicin (3 mg\/kg i.v.), DMPS (50 mg\/kg i.v.); the remaining two groups were pre-treated either with dexrazoxane (60 mg\/kg i.p.) or DMPS (50 mg\/kg i.v.) 30 min before administration of daunorubicin (3 mg\/kg i.v.). Drugs were given once a week for 10 weeks. Routine biochemical parameters were determined in weeks 1, 5 and 11. In the 11th week, invasive haemodynamic parameters were measured, then the rabbits underwent autopsy, cardiac tissue was examined by light microscopy and scored semiquantitatively. The contents of calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron and selenium were measured in the left heart ventricle. DMPS administered alone was well tolerated and did not cause any major signs of toxicity. It decreased the cardiac content of calcium, but did not affect the iron concentration. In contrast to dexrazoxane, DMPS pre-treatment did not prevent the decline in body weight in weeks 8-11 caused by daunorubicin, actually worsened mortality (26.7% vs 40.0%), did not ameliorate daunorubicin-induced nephrotic syndrome, and did not prevent the occurrence of the severe myocardial lesions. Unlike dexrazoxane, a lack of protective effect of DMPS against chronic daunorubicin toxicity in rabbits was demonstrated. The underlying cause may consist in the fact that DMPS does not efficiently chelate tissue iron and thus may not prevent the formation of oxygen free radicals.","691":"Myocardial contractile function after cardioplegic arrest is often depressed and an ideal cardioplegic solution has not been developed yet. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of phosphodiesterase III inhibitors, amrinone and enoximone, and levosimendan, a novel Ca2+ sensitizing agent, on recovery of hearts after normothermic cardioplegic arrest when added to the St. Thomas' hospital cardioplegic solution. In the control group, isolated guinea pig hearts were perfused in Langendorff apparatus and arrested with standard St. Thomas' solution. In other groups, amrinone (10(-5) mol.L-1), levosimendan (10(-5) mol.L-1), or enoximone (10(-4) mol.L-1) were added to the cardioplegic solution. In all hearts, intraventricular pressure, +dp\/dtmax, -dp\/dtmax, area under pressure-time curve, heart rate, coronary flow, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase enzyme leakage, and oxygen consumption were measured. In the enoximone group, contractility force and +dp\/dtmax, were found to be significantly high in the reperfusion and inotropic periods in comparison with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). -dp\/dtmax and area under contractility-time curve values were significantly high in inotropic period in enoximone group (p &lt; 0.05). No statistically significant difference was noted in other groups. Cardioplegic solution enrichment with enoximone augmented mechanic functions in reperfusion period. No positive effect of amrinone or levosimendan was observed in this study.","692":"The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of various experimental conditions, i.e., two different concentrations of D-fructose as a rapidly glycating substance and three incubation temperatures, on the glycation reaction of alanine aminotransferase (ALT, EC 2.6.1.2) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, EC 2.6.1.1) expressed by decreasing catalytic activities of the enzymes during a 56 day in vitro incubation period. D-fructose in the concentration of 50 mmol\/l did not inhibit the catalytic activity of either enzyme at 4 degrees C, partially inhibited AST activity in samples incubated at 25 degrees C (to 40% of the initial activity), and completely inhibited this enzyme at 37 degrees C at the end of the incubation period. In the presence of the same concentration of D-fructose, ALT showed no catalytic activity after 35 days at 25 degrees C or after 10 days at 37 degrees C. In 500 mmol\/l D-fructose, complete AST inhibition was observed after 35 days (25 degrees C) or 20 days (37 degrees C), and no ALT activity was found on day 20 at either 25 degrees C or 37 degrees C. Taking into account the highest possible stability of enzymes, we suppose that a three-week observation of their residual catalytic activity in the presence of 50 mmol\/l D-fructose at the temperature of 25 degrees C seems to be the most prospective experimental design for future glycation studies with aminotransferases under the influences of drugs.","693":"The paper presents fundamental knowledge concerning Bacillus anthracis and its potential terrorist misuse. The basic clinical forms are resumed with emphasis on inhalation infection from inspiration of B. anthracis spores. The AVA vaccine licensed in the United States, primary vaccination, protective efficacy of the vaccine, and adverse events are characterised. Stress is laid on pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax.","694":"","695":"Deep sea water intake improves skin symptoms and mineral imbalance and decreases serum IgE levels mad IgE-inducing cytokines, IL-4, IL-13 and IL-18 in patients with atopic eczema\/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS), while distilled water intake fails to do so.","696":"Serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were determined in a group of thirty two gallstone patients and compared to the values obtained in thirty two healthy control subjects. The serum levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) in gallstone patients were found to be lower than that of the control group. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, apoprotein-A and apoprotein-B concentrations were observed to be higher in gallstone patients than the controls. The differences in triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration were statistically significant. However, there was no significant difference in high density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), apoprotein-A, apoprotein-B, and total cholesterol concentrations between groups. It is concluded that gallstone formation may be related to a disturbance in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism.","697":"1. The influence of oximes (pralidoxime, obidoxime, HI-6) and anticholinergic drugs (atropine, benactyzine, biperiden, scopolamine) on the effectiveness of antidotal treatment to eliminate tabun-induced lethal effects was studied in mice. 2. Obidoxime seems to be the most efficacious oxime for the elimination of tabun-induced lethal effects in mice, although the difference in the efficacy of obidoxime and HI-6 is not significant when they are combined with atropine. 3. Obidoxime and HI-6 when combined with centrally acting anticholinergic drugs (benactyzine, biperiden and scopolamine) seem to be more efficacious in the elimination of toxic effects of the lethal dose of tabun than their combination with atropine. 4. The findings support the hypothesis that the choice of acetylcholinesterase reactivators as well as the anticholinergic drug selection are important for the effectiveness of antidotal mixture in the case of antidotal treatment of tabun-induced acute poisoning.","698":"Unspecific and side effects caused by interaction with proteins belong to common problems of many structures synthesized as potential medicaments. Possible in vitro interactions with proteins of a group of phenylsulfonyl benzoic acid derivatives (VUFB 19363, 19369, 19370, 19371, and 19760) as new potential anti-inflammatory compounds with anti-leukotrienic activities were studied in the present work. Three purified enzymes were used as model proteins with catalytic activities: Pig heart aspartate aminotransferase (AST, EC 2.6.1.1), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, EC 2.6.1.2), and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD, EC 4.1.1.15) from E. coli. Catalytic activities during incubation of individual compounds (6 x 10(-5) M solution to 5 x 10(-2) M suspension) at 37 degrees C with enzymes served as criteria of stability and function of the proteins. No immediate influence of any compound studied on enzyme activities was found. Aminotransferase activities were not affected even during incubation up to 20 d. In the case of GAD, the compounds VUFB 19369, 19370, 19371, and 19760 had stabilizing influence on GAD activity during incubation at enzyme concentrations of 11.25 and 5.62 mg prot\/l. The lack of an immediate effect of compounds and the stability of enzymes during incubation them are favorable and support the prospective of the compounds as potential drugs.","699":"Authors describe an unusual case of acute abdomen after the traffic injury. They remind correct diagnosis of delayed splenic rupture and compare it with other literature findings.","700":"Liver arterial system in humans presents wide variability. Knowledge of the variability is important for operation in this region (e.g. port-catheter implantation for regional intraarterial chemotherapy in patients with liver malignancy). The purpose of this study is to determine types of variation of liver artery system and their frequency in Czech population. The research was based on the evaluation of abdominal arteriograms, arteriography findings were confirmed during operations. There were found various anatomical relationships in this area, which may be divided into five types: type I.--standard organization occurred in 75.6% of cases; type II.--presence of accessory artery (8.2%); type III.--variation of hepatic artery origin (7.4%); type IV.--the anomalous origin of gastroduodenal artery (6.9%) and type V.--combination of varieties (1.9%). The most often was the type I that occurred in three quarters of cases approximately.","701":"Fibronectins are adhesive proteins considered as markers of endothelial activation. Plasma fibronectin levels in diabetes mellitus (DM) have been found to be associated with atherosclerotic risk factors. This study was carried out to investigate plasma fibronectin and its relation with serum lipids, apolipoproteins AI, B100 and lp(a) in diabetic children. 35 children (19F\/16M) with type I DM and 30 non-diabetic age and gender-matched controls were enrolled. Apolipoprotein and fibronectin concentrations were determined with nephelometric methods. Plasma fibronectin levels of the children with type I DM and the control group are not statistically different. HbA1c and triglycerides concentration are found to be significant predictors of plasma fibronectin in diabetic children, while effect of plasma cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI, B100 and lp(a) are insignificant. Diabetic children with triglycerides 1.13 mmol\/l have elevated plasma fibronectin (median, 25th-75th percentiles; 29.6, 8.3-40.8 mg\/dL) compared to the diabetic &gt; or = 19.9, 8.6-30.7 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.05) and non-diabetic children (16.6, 12.7-32.4 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.01) with triglycerides &lt; 1.13 mmol\/L. On the other hand plasma fibronectin concentrations of diabetic and non-diabetic children with high triglycerides are not significantly different. In conclusion our data does not support the concept that plasma fibronectin is elevated in type I diabetes mellitus at least in children, but high plasma triglycerides secondary to diabetes or not is associated with higher FNp concentrations which may have implications on atherogenesis. Plasma cholesterol, apolipoproteins AI, B100 and lp(a) are not significant determinants of FNp in type I diabetic children.","702":"The anthrax toxin comprises three proteins. When they work together, they can kill humans, especially after spores of the bacteria have been inhaled. One anthrax protein, called protective antigen (PA), chaperones the two other toxins into human or animal cells and shields them from the body's immune system. The second, lethal factor (LF), destroys the white blood cells that hosts send in defence. The third toxin molecule, edema factor (EF), hijacks the signaling system in the body. This disrupts the energy balance of cells and leads to them accumulating fluid and complete destroy of cells.","703":"The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in three groups of rabbits: 1) control (saline 1 ml\/kg i.v.); 2) daunorubicin (3 mg\/kg i.v.); 3) daunorubicin (3 mg\/kg i.v.) + dexrazoxane (60 mg\/kg i.p.). The drugs were given once a week, 10 administrations. The concentration of cTnT was measured using Elecsys Troponin T STAT Immunoassay (Roche). The concentration of cTnI was measured using AxSYM Troponin I (Abbott). The linear regression model was applied to see if there is a dependence between cTnT and cTnI. The coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.79) was acceptable only in the control group. In the remaining cases (i.e. in the daunorubicin group and in the daunorubicin + dexrazoxane treated group) R2 was too small (0.53, and 0.06). We may conclude that in rabbits after repeated administration of cardiotoxic or cardioprotective drugs meaningful dependence between cTnT and cTnI was not found. The choice of the most suitable cardiomarker in laboratory animals deserves further studies.","704":"1. The influence of some acetylcholinesterase reactivators (HI-6, obidoxime, pralidoxime) on the efficacy of antidotal treatment to eliminate soman-induced disturbance of respiration and circulation and to protect experimental animals poisoned with supralethal dose of soman (1.5 x LD50) was investigated in a rat model with on-line monitoring of respiratory and circulatory parameters. 2. Obidoxime or pralidoxime in combination with atropine were insufficient to enable soman-poisoned rats to survive for 2 hours when given 1 minute after the administration of soman. 3. On the other hand, the ability of the oxime HI-6 in combination with atropine to prevent soman-induced alteration of respiration and circulation was significantly higher. Some rats treated with HI-6 in combination with atropine were fully protected against the lethal toxic effects of soman within 2 hours following soman administration. 4. Our findings confirm that the oxime HI-6 seems to be a much more suitable and efficacious acetylcholinesterase reactivator for the antidotal treatment of severe acute soman-induced poisoning than currently used obidoxime or pralidoxime.","705":"The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of impaired barrier function of the small intestine induced by indomethacin on biochemical markers of liver damage (serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin), and liver functional parameters (serum concentration of albumin, liver DNA synthesis). Indomethacin (Sigma) was administered in 2 injections in a dose of 7.5 mg\/kg subcutaneously spaced 24 hours apart, rats were sacrificed 24, 48 or 72 hours after the second dose of indomethacin. Control rats received indomethacin vehicle (5% NaHCO3, pH 7.4, 1.0 ml\/kg) in the same manner. Small intestine injury was approved by increased permeability (measured as a lactulose-mannitol index). Significant increase of small intestine DNA synthesis (estimated by incorporation of 3H thymidine) in indomethacin-treated rats 48 (p &lt; 0.01) and 72 (p &lt; 0.05) hours after the second dose of indomethacin documents induction of reparative process. All biochemical markers of liver injury were significantly decreased in indomethacin treated rats in all recorded intervals (p &lt; 0.05). By contraries, serum concentration of albumin, which predicates about liver function, was in indomethacin-treated rats significantly decreased in all intervals (p &lt; 0.01). To explain these contrarious results of indomethacin-induced impaired barrier function of the small intestine on the liver deserves further studies.","706":"We report a case of a 60-year-old man with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated using thrombolysis, and complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS). Plasma interleukin (IL) 1 beta, IL 6, IL 8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and soluble adhesion molecule (sICAM 1, sE-selectin) levels were measured at 3-h intervals. This observation showed the effect of AMI and CS on the plasma interleukin levels. Remarkable changes were found in the plasma TNF alpha level, which reached two significant peaks. The peak of the first elevation caused by AMI (80.11 pg\/ml, vs. normal value 4.35 pg\/ml, SD 21.3 pg\/ml) was seen 6 h after the onset of the symptoms. After the period of significant decrease, TNF alpha level was increasing until the end of the observation period because of CS (the last TNF alpha level was 204.1 pg\/ml). The plasma IL 1 beta level was continually increased during the period of observation (maximal IL 1 beta level 32.1 pg\/ml, normal value &lt; 10 pg\/ml). The plasma IL 6 level reached the first peak caused by AMI nine hours after the onset of the symptoms (362.85 pg\/ml, normal value (10 pg\/ml). Because of CS, after the short period of decrease, the plasma IL 6 level was increasing until the end of the observation period (the last IL 6 level was 859.61 pg\/ml). The plasma IL 8 level was also elevated throughout the time of observation (max. value 1652 pg\/ml, vs. normal value &lt; 30 pg\/ml). The soluble adhesion molecule levels (sE-selectin and sICAM 1) were elevated throughout the period of observation without any significant peak.","707":"Knowledge of topographic anatomy is essential prerequisite for any physician to be successful in professional career. That is why we pay special attention to topographic dissections completing course of normal human anatomy at our department. Dissection procedure is subjected to relatively rigid rules demanding removal of some superficial structures during preparation of deeper layers. Thus some important structures get lost for further learning and also for final evaluation of students knowledge and manual skills. Therefore we decided to introduce digital imaging into the recording of course of preparation, the topographic relationships and unique variations. Digital acquisition of pictures through still digital camera makes possible to bypass the wet photographic process and provides instant graphic inputs for further computer processing. The image files can be further edited, printed, archived on various media and then may be used for instructional, test, evaluative, and publication purposes. Moreover, own original pictorial material is feasible to be presented at anatomy lectures. Practical results of this new approach, besides higher attractiveness and motivation impact, allow us to conclude that systematic digital acquisition of dissection pictures combined with computer processing fairly increases quality of anatomical education.","708":"The relationship between type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis has not been well established. We studied a population composed of 161 post-menopausal women with type 2 diabetes and a control group. We examined bone mineral density with the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry(DXA) technique at the lumbar and femoral regions and in a subgroup of patients, we also measured the levels of markers of bone remodelling. We found significantly higher levels of bone mineral density at the lumbar and femoral levels in the diabetic subjects compared with the control group. Moreover, we found higher level of urinary calcium in the controls. On the basis of these results, we suggest that osteoporosis cannot be considered a complication of type 2 diabetes.","709":"The aim of this randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study was to assess the effect of trimetazidine (TMZ), a potent antiischaemic drug, on plasma C-reactive protein (C-RP), cytokine and adhesion molecule levels. The study population consists of 18 patients (16 males, 2 females, average age 56.45 +\/- 10.97 years) with acute myocardial infarction admitted within 6 hours after onset of symptoms and treated with streptokinase. Blood samples were taken at 3-hour intervals during the time of treatment. All patients were randomised blindly using a centralised randomisation process, between trimetazidine (40 mg bolus i.v. then 60 mg per day for 48 hours intravenously in glucose infusion) or placebo group. Plasma C-RP level was significantly lower in TMZ group (39.5 mg\/ml +\/- 9.7 mg\/ml) as compared to placebo (75.7 +\/- 29.4 mg\/ml, p &lt; or = 0.001) and peaked 28 hours later in TMZ group. Plasma interleukin 6 (IL 6) level showed a sharp peak 9 hours after the onset of the symptoms in TMZ group (116.9 +\/- 180.2 pg\/ml vs. 45.4 +\/- 37.9 pg\/ml) and was increased up to 30 hours after the onset of the symptoms. Plasma interleukin 1 beta (IL 1 beta) was also higher in TMZ group notably 21 hours after the onset of symptoms (26.4 +\/- 9.3 pg\/ml vs. 16.2 +\/- 2.4 pg\/ml). TMZ group showed lower plasma E-selectin levels. Plasma IL 8, TNF alpha and ICAM 1 levels were without statistical significant differences. The present study demonstrates a significant reduction of plasma C-reactive protein level in the course of acute myocardial infarction treated with streptokinase and intravenous trimetazidine infusion compared with the group of patients without trimetazidine treatment.","710":null,"711":"We measured number of bcl-2, apoptotic, neutrophil, and surfactant apoprotein D (SP-D) positive cells in irradiated rat lungs during different time points after the sublethal whole-thorax irradiation of rats. We also investigated the influence of pentoxifylline (PTX) therapy on these markers. Wistar rats were given 15 Gy thoracic irradiation and PTX (35 mg\/kg) twice a week. Animals were examined histologically and imunohistochemically at intervals from 1-12 weeks. In non-treated rats compared with treated rats, bcl-2 expression was significantly inhibited from 4 weeks after irradiation. A higher apoptosis presence in non-treated rats from 4 weeks was found and apoptosis development in PTX-treated animals was delayed and started 8 weeks after irradiation. Similar differences were measured during neutrophil granulocytes examination. Neutrophil penetration in non-treated rats was found 5 weeks after irradiation in contrast to the RP onset of PTX-treated animals 8 weeks after irradiation. The number of SP-D positive cells in non-treated rats observed until 5 weeks after irradiation was higher than in the control group. PTX-treated animals expressed higher number of SP-D positive cells during the whole experiment than the control group. We suggest that apoptosis is linked to neutrophil granulocyte actions during the RP onset and that PTX-therapy causes diminished inflammation development.","712":"The use of transplantation (TR) of fetal neural tissue as a therapeutic method started much later in patients suffering from Huntington's disease (HD) than in those with Parkinson's disease. The clinical trial, following a wide range of animal experiments (neurotoxic models and newly also transgenic mice), includes about 30 HD patients until now. Because of limited use of the human fetal tissue by ethical and technical concerns, there is necessity to search for the alternative sources for neural grafting. The first attempt with xenotransplantation (in 12 HD patients) and with TR of encapsulated genetically modified cells (in 6 HD patients) was performed, but no appreciable improvement of status in any of those patients was noted. Since no effective pharmacological treatment of HD is available, the TR of fetal neural tissue is now the only therapeutic approach which provides a reduction of symptoms in most of grafted patients. The possibilities are enormous offered by neural stem cells, optionally by embryonic stem cells, which could be expanded in cultures, cloned or genetically modified and then grafted into the patient's brain. On the other hand, the neural progenitor and stem cells, normally present within the subependymal layer of the lateral brain ventricles also in adulthood, might be induced to become an endogenous source of glia and neurons participating in the brain's repair.","713":"In this study, in vivo effectiveness of ascorbic acid (AA), beta carotene (BC) and allicin in HP eradication were evaluated. 210 patients who are HP positive in biopsy were involved in this study. The patients randomised to seven treatment groups (each group consisting of 30 patients). The first group was given standard eradication treatment (lansaprasol 30 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid for 14 days). Second group received AA 1000 mg\/day in addition to the standard treatment. Third group received only AA 1000 mg\/day for 14 days. Fourth group was treated with standard regiment plus 120 mg\/day BC. Fifth group was given only BC 120 mg\/day for 14 days. Sixth group was given standard regiment and allicin 4200 micrograms\/day. Seventh group received only Allicin 1200 micrograms\/day for 14 days. The eradication was achieved in 20 (66.6%) in group I, 15 (50%) in group II, 3 (10%) in group III, 15 (50%) in group IV, 0 (0%) in group V, 27 (90%) in group VI and 7 (23.3%) in group VII. Allicin seemed to be potentially effective agent for HP eradication but ascorbic acid, beta caroten was found to be ineffective.","714":"1. To study the influence of low-level sarin exposure on cognitive functions, male albino Wistar rats were exposed to three various low concentrations of sarin (LEVEL 1-3) for 60 minutes in the inhalation chamber. Testing of cognitive functions was carried out using the T-maze evaluating learning and spatial memory. The behavior of sarin-exposed rats in the T-maze was tested several times within five weeks following sarin inhalation exposure to look for any cognitive impairments. The alteration of cognition was evaluated by using a method studying memory elicitation in response to appetitive motivation in a multiple T-maze. 2. Statistically significant, short-term deficiency in the T-maze performance was observed in rats exposed to symptomatic (LEVEL 3) as well as clinically asymptomatic concentration (LEVEL 2) of sarin. The repeated exposure of rats to clinically asymptomatic dose of sarin (LEVEL 2R) did not change the effect of low-level sarin exposure on spatial memory compared to the single exposure to the same dose of sarin. 3. Thus, sarin is able to influence the cognitive functions (e.g. spatial memory) even at low doses that do not cause clinically manifested intoxication following the inhalation exposure. Nevetheless, the alteration of spatial memory lasts for a short time only, in contrast with the severe sarin poisoning.","715":"Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is a rare disease characterized by presence of multilocular cysts in the gastrointestinal wall. Idiopathic and secondary forms of the disease can be distinguished. There are presented several theories explaining pneumatogenesis in this article. The specific and non-specific symptoms are described. Attention is drawn to the pneumoperitoneum without signs of peritoneal irritation, what is a typical complication of this disease. The suspicion of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis may be based on plain abdominal X-ray, and is usually confirmed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The therapy can be conservative or surgical. In conclusion, although pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is a rare disease, it may represent a problem in differential diagnosis of abdominal pain.","716":"The present review has focused on the cell adhesion molecules from the cadherin superfamily, in particular on E- and VE-cadherin. In general, cadherins are a large group of cell adhesion molecules located at intercellular junctions called adherent junctions. They play an important role in embryogenesis and morphogenesis in animals and humans due to their adhesive and cell-signalling functions. Disturbances of the expression or function of cadherins and their associated proteins called catenins are crucial for the initiation and development of many pathological states. E-cadherin is an epithelium-specific cadherin that is required for the development and maintenance of the normal function of all epithelial cells in tissues. The loss or down-regulation of E-cadherin is a key event in the process of tumour invasion and metastasis. The assessment of E-cadherin immunoreactivity may be a useful prognostic marker in some cancers, complementary to the established prognostic factors. VE-cadherin is an endothelium-specific cadherin, which plays a relevant role in vascular homeostasis. It has been demonstrated that VE-cadherin is required for normal vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and for the maintenance of vascular integrity. Disruption of VE-cadherin-catenin complexes by some inflammatory agents such as thrombin, by inflammatory cells, or shear stress is accompanied by an increase in vascular permeability in vivo and in vitro.","717":"Wolfram syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance. The main characteristic features of this disorder are diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. However, diabetes insipidus, sensorineural deafness, renal tract and neurologic abnormalities are seen in majority of patients. In this study, we describe a family in which two members had the main features of the syndrome while a third sibling had only sensorineural deafness. DNA analysis revealed that the fully affected siblings were homozygote for a pointmutation on chromosome 4p whereas the third sibling with deafness was a heterozygote carrier for the same mutation. The characteristics of disease and phenotypic variations that possibly related to heterozygote carrier state were discussed.","718":"Due to the constantly improving results of surgical revascularization for coronary heart disease even the elderly patients are offered more frequently this type of treatment. Since older age is a harbinger of reduced vital capacity and increased morbidity the results of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in elderly as well as long-term benefit deserve a careful examination. 1475 isolated CABG procedures performed between 1995 and 1997 in a university hospital cardiac surgery unit, divided in group I (age below 70, n = 1324) and group II (age 70 and over, n = 151). A retrospective analysis of pre-operative, peri-operative and post-operative data. Significant differences (lower BMI and BSA, advanced NYHA and CCS stage, higher prevalence of diabetes, renal dysfunction and extracardial atherosclerotic lesions) were found in elderly. CABG was performed in both groups with no differences in technique of procedure (only slightly longer duration of CPB in group II). However, there was markedly higher mortality (2.3 vs. 7.3%, p &lt; 0.005), incidence of NearMiss+ (18.4 vs. 36.4%, p &lt; 0.005) and post-operative morbidity (34.6 vs. 56.3%, p &lt; 0.005) in the older group, which was also expressed in a longer ICU stay and postoperative hospitalization. Coronary revascularization can be performed in elderly with higher but still acceptable risk. Higher mortality and associated morbidity is caused by higher preoperative prevalence of known risk factors as well as generally reduced vital capacity. Surgical procedure should not be denied to elderly population because of the age alone but a careful evaluation of an individual patient is required. ","719":"This publication presents the results of postoperative manometric investigations of 77 patients with anal fissure treated within the time span 1985-1997 by lateral sphincterotomy (LS). Results of manometric investigations are compared with digital anal examinations and subjective complaints of patients. Digital anal examination correlated with manometry results in 52 cases (68%). The correspondence between these two results was proved in 48 cases when normal finding was present. An increased sphincter tonus was found in 3 patients, all of them having the anal fissure recurrences. A marked sphincters insufficiency, which had been manifested by stool and gas incontinence was found in one case. When searching for the reason of this complication we found out that this operation procedure had been performed by an unexperienced team of surgeons. In 25 cases (32%) the digital anal assessment and manometric measurement were different. Nevertheless, the clinical symptoms in this group of patients were rather poor. To conclude we may state that manometry provides important data for preoperative evaluation of anal sphincter function and should be performed prior to lateral sphincterotomy operation at least in women.","720":"Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease with the damage of the intestinal barrier. The aim of study was to measure gut permeability in patients with untreated celiac disease and during treatment with a gluten free diet. 30 patients with celiac disease before and during treatment with gluten-free diet were investigated, 30 patients without organic damage of the gastrointestinal tract served as control. Small bowel permeability was measured using lactulose\/mannitol and lactulose\/D-xylose ratios. The saccharides were examined in the 5 hours collected urine using capillary gas chromatography. Small bowel permeability (indices lactulose\/mannitol and\/or lactulose\/xylose) increased significantly in patients with untreated celiac disease. 23 patients were followed up before and during treatment with a gluten-free diet 2-6 months after beginning of this treatment and small bowel permeability (measured as indices lactulose\/mannitol and\/or lactulose\/xylose) significantly decreased. Small bowel permeability test is a non-invasive test suitable for the diagnosis of celiac disease and monitoring of compliance to a gluten-free diet in these patients. ","721":"1. The influence of anticholinergic drugs (atropine, benactyzine, biperiden) on the efficacy of monopyridinium and bispyridinium oximes (HI-6, BI-6, obidoxime, pralidoxime, methoxime) on soman-induced supralethal poisoning was studied in mice. 2. While methoxime combined with benactyzine or biperiden seems to be more efficacious in the elimination of toxic effects of supralethal dose of soman than its combination with atropine, the efficacy of the other oximes studied against soman-induced toxic effects is not significantly influenced by the anticholinergic drug selection. 3. On the other hand, there are big differences in the effectiveness of oximes tested as to their ability to eliminate toxic effects of soman at supralethal doses. 4. The findings support the fact that the choice of acetylcholinesterase reactivator is more important than the anticholinergic drug selection for the effectiveness of antidotal mixture in the case of prophylactic administration of antidotes.","722":"Cyanobacteria, formerly called \"blue-green algae\", are simple, primitive photosynthetic microorganism wide occurrence in fresh, brackish and salt waters. Forty different genera of Cyanobacteria are known and many of them are producers of potent toxins responsible for a wide array of human illnesses, aquatic mammal and bird morbidity and mortality, and extensive fish kills. These cyanotoxins act as neurotoxins or hepatotoxins and are structurally and functionally diverse, and many are derived from unique biosynthetic pathways. All known cyanotoxins and their chemical and toxicological characteristics are presented in this article.","723":"Cultivation with 4-8 mumol\/l hypericin (specific proteinkinase C inhibitor) activated by light induced high inhibition of the rate of HL-60 cell growth. When hypericin treated cells were not exposed to light growth inhibition was insignificant. Cultivation with light activated hypericin in concentration 16 mumol\/l slightly inhibited growth rate of AtT20\/D16v-F2 cells. AtT20\/D16v-F2 cells did not proliferate in presence of light activated 32 mumol\/l hypericin. Evidence of apoptosis was found in HL-60 cells treated with 1-8 mumol\/l light activated hypericin, with maximum of apoptotic cells detected after 8 mumol\/l light activated hypericin. Light activated hypericin induces both apoptosis and necrosis in dose and time dependent manners in HL-60 cells, but causes only necrosis in AtT20\/D16v-F2 cells.","724":"The effect of physical exercise on lipid peroxidation was investigated. 27 healthy young adult male subjects were included in this study. Urine samples were collected before and after exercises. Urinary malondialdehyde and creatinine levels (Cr) were measured. Urinary malondialdehyde levels were increased by exercise. While pre-exercise malondialdehyde levels were 5.02 +\/- 1.26 nmol\/mg Cr, post-exercise levels were 6.13 +\/- 1.84 nmol\/mg Cr (p &lt; 0.05). These findings indicated that physical exercise induced lipid peroxidation. ","725":"The aim of this study is to evaluate whether any relationship between stroke and vitamin B12, folic acid concentration. We examined 50 patients with stroke (male: 26 and female: 24) aged between (mean +\/- SD, year) 59 +\/- 14 and 16 control subjects (male: 6 and female: 10) aged between (mean +\/- SD, year) 53 +\/- 11. Patients were classified into two groups as infarct and hemorrhagic by using Computerised Brain Tomography and Cranial Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging techniques. The percentage of patients with infract was 47.5% in female and 52.5% in male while it was 40% in female and 60% in male with hemorrhagic. The vitamin B12 levels of patients with infarct, hemorrhagic and control group were found as mean +\/- SEM, 355 +\/- 47 pg\/ml, 313 +\/- 58 pg\/ml, 1569 +\/- 258 pg\/ml and folic acid levels 13.4 +\/- 2.6 ng\/ml, 7.7 +\/- 1.0 ng\/ml, 14.8 +\/- 4.0 ng\/ml, respectively. The significant difference was found between subgroups of patients with stroke and control group in both folic acid and B12 vitamin levels (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). But, there was no significant difference between vitamin B12 and folic acid levels of patients with hemorrhagic and infarct. In order to well understand the effects of these vitamin in patients with stroke, more detailed follow up studies with long period are needed.","726":"In order to assess thyroid function in former opioid addicts undergoing adjunctive naltrexone (NA) p.o. treatment, we studied 24 subjects (BMI +\/- SD: 23.3 +\/- 3.2 kg\/m2) on 50 mg NA p.o. daily for 15 days to 14.5 months continuously. Measurements included thyrotropin (TSH), total thyroxin (TT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), while the TT3\/TT4100 ratio was calculated as a marker of peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Reverse T3 (rT3) and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were also measured. Statistical analysis of thyroid parameters among them, of thyroid parameters versus duration of NA use as well as of thyroid parameters versus BMI was done with linear regression. All the subjects received NA well. The thyroid hormone work-up showed that all the subjects on NA were overall euthyroid. Mean +\/- SD levels for TSH were 1.59 +\/- 0.29 mU\/L, TT4: 171.17 +\/- 14.07 nmol\/L, TT3: 2.01 +\/- 0.27 nmol\/L, TT3\/TT4100: 1.18 +\/- 0.19, rT3: 0.26 +\/- 0.07 nmol\/L and IL-6: 20.3 +\/- 36.6 pg\/mL. The duration of NA use was positively correlated with TT3 (r = +0.72, p &lt; 0.001) and TT3\/TT4 x 100 (r = +0.77, p &lt; 0.001) and negatively, but not statistically significant, with TT4 (r = -0.38, p = 0.065) and with TSH (r = -0.39, p = 0.062). No significant correlations were found between TT3 and BMI, duration of NA use and rT3 and IL-6. Although few subjects were studied, there are indications that the duration of naltrexone may be positively correlated with TT3 and the ratio of T4 to T3 conversion.","727":"Practically all types of diabetes mellitus (DM) result from complex interactions of genetic and environmental factors. Multifactorial and polygenic Type 1 DM is strongly influenced by genes controlling the immune system, mainly HLA-DQ and DR. In addition to this, many other predisposition loci, interacting with each other, have some influence on susceptibility to DM. Heterogeneous Type 2 DM, accounting for about 85% of all diabetic patients, is supposed to be induced by multiple genes defects involved in insulin action and\/or insulin secretion. Other genetically influenced traits like obesity and hyperlipidemia are strongly associated with the Type 2. The group called Other specific types of DM include monogenic forms MODY 1-5 and many various subtypes of the disease, where the specific gene mutations have been identified. Both genetic and intrauterine environmental influences are likely to contribute to the abnormalities defined as Gestational DM.","728":"It has been suggested that an insertion\/deletion (I\/D) polymorphism in intron 16 of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene may be associated with essential hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine the association between ACE I\/D polymorphism with blood pressure level and hypertension status in Turkish type 2' diabetic subjects. Hundred and seven hypertensive (78 female, 29 male) and 132 normotensive type 2 diabetic subjects (73 female, 59 male) and 138 sex and age matched control subjects (87 female, 51 male) without diabetes and hypertension were included into the study. The I\/D polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There were no statistically difference in genotypic and allelic frequencies of the ACE I\/D polymorphism between the hypertensive and normotensive diabetic patients and control subjects. Also no significant differences was detected in systolic and diastolic blood pressure among three different genotypes. ACE I\/D polymorphism does not seem to play an important role in the development of hypertension in Turkish type 2 diabetic subjects, but prospective studies may show an association between ACE gene polymorphism and the development of hypertension in diabetic subjects.","729":"1. Long term effects of low doses of highly toxic organophosphorus agent sarin on behavioral and neurophysiological functions were studied in rats exposed to sarin by inhalation. The toxic effects of sarin were monitored using a functional observational battery (FOB), an automatic measurement of motor activity and a test of excitability of central nervous system at 3, 6 and 12 months following sarin exposure. 2. The results indicate that sarin at symptomatic as well as asymptomatic doses (level 2 and 3) is able to induce some neurotoxic effects (a decrease in activity and mobility, an alteration of gait, an increase in stereotyped behavior) including an increase in the excitability of central nervous system (an increase in convulsive activity following the administration of pentamethylenetetrazole) in rats at 3 months following inhalation exposure. Some sings of increased excitability were also observed in sarin-exposed rats following 6 or 12 months (an increase in exploratory activity, body temperature and a hindlimb grip strength at 6 months following exposure to sarin at asymptomatic doses, an increase in tail-pinch response at 12 months following exposure to sarin at symptomatic doses). 3. Therefore, nerve agents such as sarin seem to be harmful not only at high, clinically symptomatic doses but also at low, clinically asymptomatic doses because of long term manifestation of alteration of neurophysiological functions in sarin-exposed rats without disruption of cholinergic nervous system.","730":"We studied the relationship between type II pneumocytes number and alveolar septal thickness during different time after sublethal whole-thorax irradiation of rats and we investigated the influence of pentoxifylline (TNF-alpha inhibitor). Wistar rats were exposed to 15 Gy thoracic irradiation and pentoxifylline (35 mg\/kg) twice a week. Lungs were examined histologically and immunohistochemically at intervals ranging from 1-12 weeks and alveolar septal thickness, number of type II pneumocytes (identified by immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 18), and neutrophile granulocytes were counted. Significant increase of alveolar septal thickness and type II pneumocytes depletion 3 weeks after irradiation were found. Correlation of these markers was r = -0.759. Pentoxifylline significantly inhibits increased alveolar septal thickness without the influence on type II pneumocytes number. Neutrophil penetration started 5 weeks after irradiation in non-treated animals, 8 weeks after irradiation in PTX-treated rats. We suggest that pneumocytes depletion is linked to increased vascular permeability, and pentoxifylline therapy does not influence on pneumocytes kinetics after irradiation.

The aim of the study was to compare the costs and outcomes of using amitriptyline, citalopram and fluoxetine in the treatment of major depression. Ninety patients (69 women) with a mean age of 44.5 years (S.D. = 14.3) suffering from major depression were treated with amitriptyline (N = 31), citalopram (N = 29) and fluoxetine (N = 30). Direct medical costs and effectiveness (indicated by the number of hospitalization-free days) were assessed in a prospective, open, intent-to-treat study. Neither cost nor effectiveness were significantly different among the treatment groups. Amitriptyline treatment is not less expensive nor more effective than citalopram or fluoxetine therapies. There is no advantage in restricting patients from treatment with SSRIs, which have fewer adverse effects and a decreased risk of a lethal overdosage in comparison with tricyclic antidepressants. ","734":"A weight-reducing potential has been ascribed to high dietary fibre intake. To investigate the practical reliability of this hypothesis, fifty-three moderately overweight females (BMI &gt; 27.5 kg\/m2) on reduced energy intake (1200 kcal\/day) were treated for 24 weeks with a fibre supplement on a randomly, double-blind, placebo-controlled basis. The fibre was administered as an initial dose of 6 g and a maintenance dose of 4 g. Body weight and blood pressure were recorded weekly during the first 3 months and thereafter every second week. Blood samples were drawn at start and at end of the study. Initial body weights were 75.6 +\/- 1.6 kg in the fibre group versus 75.5 +\/- 1.6 kg in the placebo group. After treatment, mean weight loss in the fibre group was 8.0 kg versus 5.8 kg in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in both groups without differences between the groups. Serum concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid were significantly reduced in the group with reduced energy intake, whereas no additional effect was observed when fibre was supplemented. Serum concentrations of potassium and sodium did not change significantly. The results suggest that a dietary fibre supplement in combination with a hypocaloric diet is of value as an adjunct in the management of overweight.","735":"Supportive care in tumour chemotherapy is a subject of intensive research. The complications of cytostatic therapy are a cause of extensive research of their pharmacological interactions and side effects. The immunologic and biochemical changes accompanying tumours are the factor that is most responsible for the worsening of the physiology of the host. Regimens containing carnitine and it's acetyl-derivative are used in many cases, among others even for preventing hepatotoxicity. Our hypothesis was to verify the supporting metabolic effects of acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride (ALC) in combined therapy with mitoxantrone (MX) and hepatotoxic cytostatic drugs including alkylating agents. This present report describes the effect of ALC in combination with MX on DBA\/2 male mice bearing a transplantable L1210 leukemia resistant to MX. The criterion for evaluation of effect was the length of survival time of experimental animals. The proportional-hazards model quadratic in the drug dose (7) was used for survival time evaluation and optimal dose calculation. The hazard functions and the index of relative hazard were determined using Weibull distribution after logarithmic transformation of the entered data in each particular group. The dose-response curve was represented by a second-degree polynomial without absolute term. The combination therapy revealed that the optimal dose of ALC was 186 mg\/kg s.c. This relation is shown in Fig.1. A significant effect of ALC (s.c.) in combined therapy with MX (6 mg\/kg i.v.) given to animals bearing an experimental form of leukemia L1210\/MX resistant to MX was proven at a level of probability p &lt; or = 0.001. The effect of ALC in monotherapy was not demonstrable.","736":"The polyamines (putrescine, cadaverine, agmatine, spermidine and spermine), wide-spread in all organisms, have been shown to play a role in regulation of growth and differentiation of virtually all types of cells. Their role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes have been studied very intensively during the last two decades. Inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis have potential clinical uses as antitumor and antiparasitic agents. The brief summary with regard to their biological consequences in mammals is discussed in this paper.","737":"","738":"This study was done to compare the protective effect of blood and crystalloid cardioplegia in patients with left ventricular dysfunction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Sixty consecutive patients with left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35% scheduled for CABG with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass without additional procedures were randomly divided into two groups. In the first group we used cold blood cardioplegia, in the second group cold crystalloid cardioplegia, both delivered only ortogradely. We measured hemodynamic data in early hours after operation, enzyme release and we collected other clinical data which could be influenced by perioperative myocardial protection. There was no death in either group. We also didn't find any significant difference in incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and use of intraaortic balloon pumping between both groups. In an early hours after operation in the group with blood cardioplegia we found significantly better hemodynamic data (LVSWI, RVSWI) and significantly lower enzyme release. We conclude, that cold blood cardioplegia shows superior perioperative myocardial protection resulting in earlier restoration of myocardial function. This difference could be important in patients with high degree of left ventricular dysfunction.","739":"The aim of this study was to map normal levels of serum soluble isoforms of adhesion molecules in relation to age and sex in the group of school-aged children. sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin were determined in the group of 158 normal children subdivided into two subgroups; 6-10 years (68 children, median age 8 years) and 11-15 years (90 children, median age 12 years) and in 70 normal adult blood donors (25 females and 45 males, median age 46 years). The levels of sICAM-1 and sE-selectin fell down significantly over the age range 6-15 years, while the level of sVCAM-1 was remained. Age-related normal ranges were established using correlation analysis and were expressed as the 5%-95% percentiles intervals: sICAM-1 206.8-486.8 ng\/ml, sE-selectin 36.7-153.2 ng\/ml in the group of 6-10 years old children, sICAM-1 184.1-354.0 ng\/ml, sE-selectin 29.9-114.1 ng\/ml in group of 11-15 years old children. The levels of sVCAM-1 were 359.6-822.0 ng\/ml and were constant within the examined age interval from 6 to 15 years. The influence of sex was also assayed and it was not statistically significant in any age category tested. Normal ranges of sICAM-1 (60.2-218.4 ng\/ml), sE-selectin (8.3-116.9 ng\/ml) and sVCAM-1 (338.0-1148.0 ng\/ml) were established for adult population of healthy blood donors using the same methods.","740":"The present work was designed to determine whether the individual differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amiodarone and its N-desethyl metabolite are related to cytochrome CYP3A metabolizer status. 12 cardiac patients with inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias during the baseline electrophysiologic study were enrolled in this study. Urinary 24-hour excretion of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol (6 beta-OHC and the ratio of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol to urinary free cortisol (6 beta-OHC\/UFC) were measured before the first amiodarone administration. Trough plasma concentrations of amiodarone and N-desethylamiodarone (N-DEA) were measured after 79 +\/- 11 days (2nd period) and after 182 +\/- 25 days (3rd period). Electrophysiologic effects of amiodarone therapy were established with serial electrophysiologic studies in 9 of these patients at the baseline and after 79 +\/- 11 days (during the second period). Both the 6 beta-OHC excretion and 6 beta-OHC\/UFC ratio varied approximately 6-fold between the patients. We found significant inverse correlation between the 6 beta-OHC excretion and the trough plasma concentrations of amiodarone at the time of the 3rd period (rs = -0.58, p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, there was correlation between the 24-hour urinary 6 beta-OHC excretion and trough plasma concentrations of amiodarone during the 3rd period (rs = -0.64, p &lt; 0.025). We were unable to detect any association between CYP3A activity and amiodarone pharmacodynamics. This study points toward important information value of CYP3A metabolizer status in the context of therapeutic drug monitoring of amiodarone. ","741":"1. Long term alteration of immune functions caused by low doses of nerve agent sarin were studied in rats exposed to sarin by inhalation. The alteration of immune functions by sarin was monitored by using two methods (the evaluation of in vitro spontaneous as well as stimulated proliferation of spleen cells and in vitro bactericidal activity of peritoneal macrophages) at 3, 6 and 12 months following sarin exposure. 2. The results indicate that not only symptomatic but also asymptomatic dose of sarin is able to alter some immune functions at six and twelve months following exposure to sarin. 3. Thus, not only organophosphorus insecticides but also nerve agents such as sarin can be potentially immunotoxic even at very low doses that do not cause clinically manifested intoxication following the inhalation exposure. The ability of sarin at low doses to alter immune functions seems to be really long term (up to 12 months following the exposure).","742":"Although hexavalent chromium has been shown to induce apoptosis in cells cultivated in vitro, there appear to be no studies focusing on the dynamics of this process. To find out about dynamic patterns of hexavalent chromium-induced apoptosis, we treated Hep2 cells with 150 micrograms\/ml potassium chromate and recorded their behavior as well as appearance of some crucial organelles using different morphological and biochemical methods. We found that Hep2 cells showed the earliest observable changes at 6 hours after the treatment (blebbing, chromatin shrinkage), with the entire apoptotic process lasting up to 24 hours. While all the observed cell features clearly prove apoptosis induced by hexavalent chromium, a typical apoptotic hallmark, DNA ladder, seems not to occur in this type of cells. On the other hand, in HL60 cells, used as a control, this ladder was observable.","743":"Anthracycline antibiotics are among the most effective and widely used antineoplastic drugs. Their usefulness is limited by a cumulative dose-related cardiotoxicity, whose precise mechanisms are not clear as yet. The principal role is possibly exerted by free oxygen radicals generated by \"redox-cycling\" of anthracycline molecule and\/or by the formation of anthracycline-ferric ion complexes. The iron catalyzes the hydroxyl radical production via Haber-Weiss reaction. The selective toxicity of ANT against cardiomyocytes results from high accumulation of ANT in cardiac tissue, appreciable production of oxygen radicals by mitochondria and relatively poor antioxidant defense systems. Other additional mechanisms of the anthracycline cardiotoxicity have been proposed--calcium overload, histamine release and impairment in autonomic regulation of heart function. The currently used methods for an early identification of anthracycline cardiotoxicity comprise ECG measurement, biochemical markers, functional measurement and morphologic examination. Among a plenty of studied cardioprotective agents only dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) has been approved for clinical use. Its protective effect likely consists in intracellular chelating of iron. However, in high doses dexrazoxane itself may cause myelotoxicity. This fact encourages investigation of new cardioprotectants with lower toxicity. Orally active iron chelators and flavonoids attract more attention. Modification of dosage schedule and synthesis of new anthracycline analogues may represent alternative approaches to mitigate anthracycline cardiotoxicity while preserving antitumour activity.","744":"TP-53 deficient cells of human leukaemia HL-60 die by massive apoptosis after treatment by high (50-100 nmol\/l) doses of DNA damaging agent Idarubicin, regardless of the cell-cycle phase, in which they are affected. In contrary, after relatively low dose 10 nmol\/l the cells die after cell-cycle arrest in G2 phase. The results show, that apoptosis induced by idarubicin could appear independently of the cell-cycle phase and that period in which apoptosis is observed is related to the dose of Idarubicin.","745":"Rapidly growing body of evidence on cell death mechanisms and its disorders during last five years has replaced old paradigms and opened new horizons in medicine. Identification of different morphological and signaling aspects, as well as variances in requirement for energy enabled us to construct a theory of three main types of cell death: necrosis, apoptosis, and lysosomal cell death. Mitochondria, certain oncoproteins such as Bcl-2 family, and special catabolic enzymes participating in cellular demise might serve as targets for pharmacological manipulation. Upregulation or downregulation of programmed cell death has been implicated in ischemic, neurodegenerative, and autoimmune disorders, as well as in oncology and chronic inflammation. This minireview brings a short overview of genesis and development of theories on programmed cell death and apoptosis, summarizes basic relevant facts on apoptotic mechanisms and draws a new hypothesis on possible implication in medicine and surgery.","746":"The authors describe a case of a 46-year-old man with ischemic heart disease who underwent coronary surgery.

The incidence of it is still in the range of 0.4%-5%. The aims of our study were to assess the adequacy of regimen using ceftazidim (CTZ), ciprofloxacin (CPF) and clindamycin (CLIN) as prophylactic antibiotics and to verify whether cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can modify the time of antibiotic serum concentrations. That is why the serum levels of them were measured during open heart procedures. The prospective study comprised 75 consequent coronary patients randomized in to three groups receiving 1 g of CTZ or 400 mg of CPF or 900 mg of CLIN i.v. with anesthesia induction. Routine coronary surgery with left internal mammary artery harvesting, moderate body hypothermic (30 degrees C) CPB with crystaloid cardioplegia was performed. Serum antibiotic levels were determined before application, with skin incision, prior CPB induction, after cardioplegia infusion, every 20 minutes of CPB, prior end of CPB, in time of chest closure. Conventional cylinder-plate microbiological assay was used for antibiotic level measurement. All serum antibiotic concentrations showed a sharp decrease immediately after starting CPB and lasted until CPB ended. After initiating of CPB after cardioplegia administration serum concentrations of CTZ (105 min after initial dose) decreased by, on average 55%, CPF (97 min) by 42% and CLIN (116 min) by 78%. CPB can modify the time course of antibiotic serum concentrations. The serum levels of CTZ at the end of the longest procedures were found to be below the MICs for some of the suspected pathogens. We recommend to use higher antibiotic doses for prophylaxis and to administer the second dose with protamin sulphate to obtain maximum concentration in newly formed blood clots. ","748":"1. The changes in contents of DNA and total protein in the liver of the rats exposed to low level sarin by inhalation at 3, 6 and 12 months following the exposure were studied. The influence of sarin on the DNA and protein metabolism in liver was determined by the measurements of incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA, the concentration of DNA and total protein. 2. Our results show that not only symptomatic level 3 but also asymptomatic levels 1 and 2 of sarin are able to significantly decrease the incorporation of radiolabelled thymidine without changing total concentrations of DNA as well as protein at three months following sarin exposure. On the other hand, the significant decrease in total contents of DNA and protein in liver without the changes in the incorporation of tritiated thymidine was determined in liver six months following sarin exposure. Practically no significant changes in the metabolism of DNA and protein were observed at 12 months following sarin exposure. 3. Thus, not only clinically manifested intoxication but also low-level, asymptomatic exposure to nerve agents such as sarin is able to influence the metabolism of nucleic acids as well as proteins even several months following the exposure.","749":"Decarboxylation of aromatic amino acid in mammalian tissues is catalyzed by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (EC. 4.1.1.28, AAD). The enzyme differs in its affinity to individual aromatic amino acids, the best substrates being 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and 5-hydroxytroptophan. Surprisingly, AAD is abundant in the liver, where the substrates with rather low affinity to AAD as tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine are offered to decarboxylation. In the present paper, the possibility of interference of tryptophan with decarboxylation of phenylalanine, tyrosine as well as dopa in the liver was investigated. The AAD activity was measured radiometrically with 1-14C-labeled aromatic amino acid substrates using the rat liver enzyme. The influence of tryptophan on decarboxylation of tyrosine was formally competitive with Ki = 9.2 x 10(-3) M, while the inhibition of decarboxylation of phenylalanine by tryptophan was non-competitive with Ki at 2.75 x 10(-2) M. The effect of tryptophan on decarboxylation of dopa was small and it could not be expressed in terms of inhibition kinetics and inhibition constant. At physiological concentrations of aromatic amino acids in plasma, tryptophan does not seem to have remarkable effects on decarboxylation of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and dopa in the liver.","750":"3-Nitropropionic acid as well as 3-nitro-1-propanol and its beta-D-glucopyranoside (miserotoxin) are the plant and fungal toxins reported to interrupt mitochondrial electron transport resulting in cellular energy deficit. These nitrotoxins induce neurological degeneration in ruminants and humans. 3-Nitropropionic acid-intoxicated rats serve as the animal model for Huntington's disease.","751":"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder in which intravascular hemolysis results from the somatic mutation of the totipotent stem cells causing an intrinsic defect in red cell membrane. PNH cells lack glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored membrane proteins. Of these proteins absence of CD 59 (MIRL--membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis, protectin) and CD 55 (DAF--decay accelerating factor) makes the PNH cells abnormally sensitive to the lytic action of complement. The defect appears to be in the somatic mutation of the X-linked PIG-A (phosphatidylinositolglycan A class) gene which participate in an early step of GPI-anchor synthesis. PNH is characterized by recurrent life threatening venous thromboses and an intimate association with aplastic anemia (AA). It seems that PNH always coexists with bone marrow failure (BMF) (37). The possible explanation may be that some GPI-anchored proteins may be a critical target recognized by immune effector cells. PNH clones not possessing these critical GPI-anchored proteins will survive because they are selectively resistant to the autoimmune assault that eliminates most normal clones. The flow cytometry of erythrocytes using anti-CD 59 and anti-CD 59 and anti-CD 55 of granulocytes has been now introduced as a very sensitive and quantitative method of PNH diagnosis able to detect PNH cells even in normal individuals (1,54). Thus it seems now clear that we must make distinction between the detection of very occasional PNH cells in patients with BMF and PNH as a clinicohematological entity. Unfortunately, we do not know the minimal content of PNH cells required to produce clinical signs of PNH (38).","752":"One of the less frequent complications of anticoagulant therapy is damage to the femoral and sciatic nerves due to bleeding.

Contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs) were estimated using the VCTS 6500 board. The standardised measurement procedure was performed. The value of the threshold contrast sensitivity was obtained for five spatial frequencies (1.5-3-6-12-18 c\/deg). Other data was collected (duration of diabetes, BCVA, funduscopy, fluoresceine angiography, HbA1C). The study group consisted of 48 IDDM patients (94 eyes) without diabetic retinopathy and with Snellen BCVA &gt; 1.0. The control group (56 normals, 98 eyes) was age and BCVA matched. Highly statistically significant decrease of the CSFs in all spatial frequencies in the study group was obtained. Correlation between duration of the diabetes and impaired degree of CSFs was present in the middle spatial frequency. No significant changes in CSFs were found among patients with pathological value of glycated hemoglobin HbA1c (&gt; 7.8%). If compared with routinely used Snellen visual acuity, the CSFs are more complex descriptors of the subjects vision abilities. IDDM has an influence on these sensitive functions, especially during examination in the middle spatial frequency of 6 and 12 c\/deg, before disturbing visual acuity and before changes in the retinal morphology. Decrease of CSFs was influenced mainly by the patients' age and partially (in the middle spatial frequency) by the IDDM duration. ","756":"1. The neuroprotective effects of antidotes (atropine, obidoxime\/atropine mixture, HI-6\/atropine mixture) on rats poisoned with soman at a sublethal dose (48 micrograms\/kg i.m.; 60% of LD50 value) were studied. The neurotoxicity was monitored using a functional observational battery (FOB) and an automatic measurement of motor activity. The neurotoxicity of soman was monitored at 24 h and 7 d following soman poisoning. 2. The results indicate that atropine alone and the oxime HI-6 in combination with atropine seem to be effective antidotal treatment for the elimination of soman-induced neurotoxicity in the case of sublethal poisonings. 3. On the other hand, the combination of obidoxime with atropine appears to be practically ineffective in diminishing neurotoxic soman-induced symptoms. 4. Dealing with neuroprotective effects of antidotes, the oxime HI-6 in combination with atropine seems to be more suitable antidotal mixture than obidoxime in combination with atropine even in the case of sublethal poisoning with nerve agents.","757":"Ganoderma lucidum, a mushroom long used in the East for a broad range of disorders, contains numerous pharmacologically active compounds. Very important of them are highly oxygenated anti-inflammatory triterpenes, which are the aim of this mini-review.","758":"The present indications for surgery are mainly large or increasing bullae that result in compression of apparently good lung tissue, and the complications of bullous diseases such as pneumothorax. The results of local resection of localized giant bullae are dramatic. The resection of small bullae generally has little effect on lung function. Lobectomy should not be done until bullae have been removed locally and the remaining lung has been tested by positive ventilation. The indications for the resection of large bullae in the presence of diffuse emphysema require very careful individual study. Pulmonary function tests are mandatory but computed tomography is the single most useful method of assessing the extent of the bullous disease and the underlying lung disease. If the underlying lung is diffusely cystic then any surgical treatment is palliative only.","759":"A retrospective study of 68 cases of tumours and tumour-like lesions related to the scapula, included in the registry of the Bone Tumour Reference Centre at the Institute of Pathology\/University Clinics, Basle, has been carried out. Each case was evaluated for lesion entity, activity and location, age and sex of the patient, and, in 49 files with available radiographic documentation (mostly plain films), for radiologic appearance, with the aim to predict the histologic diagnosis or at least the correct dignity of the lesion. Statistically most frequent were cartilaginous tumours. More than 1\/3 of all cases were osteochondromas, which demonstrated mostly a typical appearance. They were encountered predominantly in the first 3 decades in males and were located most often in the body of the scapula. 1\/4 of all cases were chondrosarcomas, which were prevailing in the 4th-7th decades, but were occasionally found at a younger age too. Chondrosarcomas were located mainly at the lateral scapular margin over the inferior angle and in the acromion and coracoid process and their appearance ranged from typical to falsely benign. 1\/3 of the cases represented a number of other benign and malignant histological entities.","760":null,"761":"A successful pregnancy is dependent on the development of adequate placental circulation. The abnormalities of placental vasculature may result in a number of gestational pathologies, including fetal loss. The aim of our study was to determine whether women with f V Leiden are at an increased risk of pregnancy loss. For this purpose we assessed three groups of women. In a prospective group we examined 30 females with spontaneous abortions for f V Leiden. In a retrospective group we assessed the frequency of abortions in 80 women (172 pregnancies) with f V Leiden (72 heterozygous, 8 homozygous) from 57 unrelated families. In a control group we evaluated the frequency of abortions in 45 women without f V Leiden. Factor V Leiden was found in 3% of women in the 1st group. Fetal loss occurred in 10% of women in the 2nd group and in 9% in the 3rd group. Factor V Leiden was not found to be a risk factor for fetal loss in our study group.","762":"The influence of repeated i.v. administration of dimethoxybenfluron (NO-1-B) (12 or 24 mg base\/kg once weekly, 10 weeks) on biochemical and haematological parameters were studied in rabbits in vivo. No significant changes were mostly found in the serum ion levels between the dimethoxybenfluron and the control groups, as well as in most of other biochemical parameters (including total protein and albumin levels). Nevertheless, the lower dose of dimethoxybenfluron caused an increase in the glucose level. Furthermore, no significant changes were mostly present also in haematological parameters in the dimethoxybenfluron groups of rabbits (a mild decrease in thrombocytes and leucocytes). The results of our study support an assumption of good tolerance of dimethoxybenfluron from the viewpoint of its influence on biochemical and haematological parameters in rabbits and may be considered of importance for a possible therapeutic use of the derivatives.","763":"As minimal residual disease (MRD) is considered the detection of hairy cells (HCs) in a patient with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in complete remission with the absence of detectable HCs by routine morphology of peripheral blood, aspirates and bone marrow core sections, using more sensitive methods of identification as immunohistological staining or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect immunoglobulin heavy chain genes rearrangement. Various monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) as CD20, DBA.44, B ly-7, HC2, CD25 and CD11c have been applied using immunological staining. There is no standardized technique for identification of MRD. According to the technique used the MRD has been detected in 13% to 100% of patients in complete remission (CR). It may be concluded that many patients, if not all, in stable CR may have residual HCs. Whether MRD will have impact on early relapse or on long term outcome, or whether patients in CR with persistent MRD will remain so, is a matter of a longer follow-up.","764":"","765":"","766":"The isolated perfused rat liver method (IPRL) was used to find, isolate and identify further metabolites of Phase I and Phase II biotransformation of the potential cytostatic agent benfluron with special regard to the conjugation processes. Its pharmacokinetic profile during the perfusion was also estimated. The rat liver was isolated from the body and perfused in vitro using a recirculating perfusion system. Benfluron was added to the reservoir as a bolus in doses of 200, 100, 30 mg\/kg of body weigh and 1 mg\/perfusate volume and also as a continual infusion in a dose of 0.1 mg\/min in separate series of experiments. The following metabolites formed during Phase I biotransformation were found in the perfusion liquid as well as in the bile: benfluron N-oxide, 9-hydroxy benfluron, demethylated 9-hydroxy benfluron, demethylated benfluron, and reduced benfluron. The major Phase II metabolite found in the bile samples was the glucuronide of 9-hydroxy benfluron. The pharmacokinetic profile of benfluron in IPRL indicated its main disposition and metabolic pathway, i.e. its rapid extraction from perfusate by the liver (t1\/2 alpha = 3.76 min), 9-hydroxylation followed up O-glucuronidation and excretion to the bile. It was revealed that 12% of the total dose of the parent compound was excreted to the bile in the form of conjugates during the first hour of perfusion, 32% during 1.5 hour, and 70% during 2 hours after the administration of benfluron. The conjugates with glucuronic acid represented 96-98% of all metabolites found in the bile.","767":"Behavioural effects of two experimental neurotoxins, mescaline and DSP-4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine), on retention of spatial orientation were studied in the T-maze. The stereotaxic administration of both neurotoxins into the selected brain structures was chosen to reveal this effect.

Though subject to continuous technological refinement controversial opinions exist on its validity in subsets of critically ill patients, patients with heart disease or after cardiac surgery. A comparison study between thermodilution (TD) and bioimpedance (TEB) was performed in 28 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery (CABG, aortic or mitral valve replacement or combined procedures). 128 pairs of cardiac index estimates at specific time points during 20 hours at the postoperative ICU were evaluated. A poor correlation (r = 0.26, p &lt; 0.05, bias -0.07 l.min-1.m2, precision + 1.1 l.min-1.m-2, 95% limits of agreement -2.27-2.13 l.min-1.m-2) between TD and TEB cannot support the routine use of TEB monitoring in early postoperative period after open-heart surgery. Possible reasons of lack of agreement in this population are discussed.

After one year the duration of filtered QRS remains the most stable parameter of SA ECG on the contrary to parameters describing end of fQRS--i.e. both HFLA and RMS. Moreover fQRS seems to have better specificity in comparison to HFLA and RMS. An estimation of significant long-term changes in individual parameters of SA ECG was obtained. According to our results, only changes in QRS +\/- 13 ms, fQRS +\/- 8 ms, HFLA +\/- 22 ms and RMS +\/- 17 microV should be considered significant when found in a long-term follow-up of patients with a heart disease.","773":"Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels, basal thyrotropin, total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine and free triodothyronine were assayed in 29--otherwise healthy--patients with pulmonary tuberculosis before initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment and after two weeks of therapy. Twenty seven out of 29 patients presented low-normal total triiodothyronine levels, showing a statistical elevation after anti-tuberculosis therapy. Total triiodothyronine levels before anti-tuberculosis therapy were inversely correlated with levels of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptors.

When mice were treated two min after mevinphos poisoning, no significant differences in the therapeutic effectiveness of tested oximes were observed. They increased the 24h LD50 values of mevinphos about three times in comparison with non-treated intoxicated animals. 3. On the other hand, there were significant differences in their therapeutic efficacy when they were administered 30 sec following mevinphos challenge. The monopyridinium oxime 2,5-PAEtM seems to be the most efficacious against mevinphos toxicity. 4.

Surgical revascularization of reversibly dysfunctional myocardium improves significantly both patient's clinical status and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Diagnosis of HM prior to CABG surgery seems to be crucial because it does not leave the patient with multivessel CAD and LVD a candidate only for heart transplantation (HTX). In the presence of HM, more aggressive surgical approach could be recommended to salvage chronically jeopardized but viable myocardium using not only routine CABG procedures in extracorporeal circulation (ECC) but also alternative approach of coronary endarterectomy (EAE) or minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (MIDCAB) procedures on beating heart, without any adverse impact on operative mortality.","778":"The appetite suppressing effect of tobacco products, via the main pharmacological agent nicotine, is a major reason for its usage both by woman and man. Food intake (FI) could be changed by altering either meal size (MZ) or meal number (MN), which are regulated dependently in a reciprocal manner. The present study investigated the effect of systemic nicotine administration on the rat feeding pattern. Because of gender differences in the effects of nicotine, both male and female rats were studied. Alzet mini-osmotic pumps (Model 2001) and the automated rat eatometer were used to evaluate the feeding pattern of male and female Fischer 344 rats during seven days of systemic nicotine infusion (6 mg\/kg b.w. s.c.). The main findings are: 1) systemic nicotine infusion decreased food intake in both sexes; 2) the decreased food intake was due to significantly reduced meal sizes while meal numbers were not altered significantly in either males or females; 3) the cyclical pattern of vaginal smears, food intake, meal number and meal size of female rats was not affected by nicotine administration. We conclude that the feeding suppressive effect of nicotine, which is due to reduced meal sizes and thus satiation, is not sex-hormones related.","779":"Experiments were performed in the genetically hypertensive Koletsky rats and in their lean siblings at the age of two and three months. In the study of development of glycide and lipid abnormalities animal represents control for itself. At the age of two months Koletsky obese rats show relative to their lean controls elevation of plasma triglycerides (males +184%, female +152%) and insulin (males +169%, females +201%). During one month plasma triglycerides elevated in lean males +9%, in lean females 0%, but in obese males +21%, in obese females +139%. Considering insulinemia similar results were obtained. Thus during one month insulin elevates in lean males +19%, in lean females +23%, but in obese males +80%, in obese females +144%. During one month glucose intolerance is elevated as well only in obese rats. Total plasma cholesterol during period of one month shows no changes in both substrains of rats. Similar picture can be found in basal glycemia. In all groups of rats no changes were registered except one, i.e., obese females show decrease. Considering the substrain differences in basal glycemia then at age of one as well as two months obese of both sexes show elevation. As to the body weight at the age of two as well as three months there is increase in obese rats. The changes of body weight during one month are expressively higher in obese rats.","780":"Plasma prolactin was measured in genetically hypertensive obese Koletsky rats, in their lean siblings and in normotensive rats of Wistar strain.

In principle, the pulse oximetry signal obtained by common finger probe was used to measure the change in its time course after changes in pacemaker stimulation. The Eagle 4000 monitor, manufactured by Marquette USA, was used for measurements and digitizing the data and then this data was analyzed using a portable personal computer with original programs developed in Famulus v. 3.5. Our results were compared to the standard method for optimizing AV delay which uses the direct measurement of blood pressure in the ascending aorta. Twenty-four patients with Physios pacemakers were enrolled in the pilot study. Measurements showed a positive correlation (r = 0.982, N = 432) between the changes in the pulse oximetry amplitude and changes in the pressure pulse amplitude measured in the ascending aorta by a catheter-tip manometer. These results indicated that this new method could be a possible alternative to the currently used techniques for AV interval optimization.","785":"Effects of local administration of atropine into the medial septal nucleus (MSN) and dorsal septal nucleus (DSN) were tested in laboratory rats. Atropine administration led to the development of a spike\/wave activity in the hippocampus as well as amygdala within 10 minutes.

In control animals insulin binding shows substrain and tissue dependence being elevated in lean rats except insulin binding to erythrocytes where inverse is true. Terguride increases percentage of specific insulin binding to erythrocytes in all groups except obese females, terguride increases percentage of specific binding to adipose tissue except lean females, the mentioned drug remained without effect in muscle tissue in all group except lean females where drug induced elevation was detected. The effect of terguride in liver tissue was monitored only in males of both substrains, elevation was found only in lean. GLUT-4 was analyzed only in muscle tissue.

Circuits were primed with the calculated volume of priming solution, circulated for 5 minutes and tested for microbial contamination by withdrawing 20 ml of the priming solution and 10 days incubated in Thioglycolate and Sabouraud culture mediums. All were found to be free of microbial contamination. The results of this investigation demonstrate that the sterility of the extracorporeal circuit, pre-assembled in advance of actual priming, can be maintained over an extended interval when standard aseptic technique is used. This allows the utilization of a pre-assembled circuit for emergency cardiopulmonary support.","792":"Metabolic studies support the findings that antioxidants inhibit atherosclerosis. Treatment with vitamin E reduced both the susceptibility of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to in vivo lipid peroxidation and atherosclerosis and smooth muscle proliferation. Thus the aim of present study was to examine metabolic consequences of reduced plasma LDL-C during hypolipidemic therapy and the distribution of antioxidant vitamin E. A group of 10 patients (4 men, 6 women, age 35-65y) with familial hypercholesterolaemia was treated using pravastatin (Lipostat Bristol Myers Squibb, 40 mg daily at 6:00 PM). Blood samples were examined before treatment, after 4 and 8 weeks of therapy. After ultracentrifugation, samples were analyzed for lipoprotein fractions and the content of vitamin E and cholesterol. Pravastatin reduced both total cholesterol (9.85 +\/- 0.74 vs. 6.81 +\/- 0.51 mmol\/1; p &lt; 0.01), LDL-C (6.42 +\/- 0.45 vs. 4.51 +\/- 0.45 mmol\/l; p &lt; 0.01), light LDL1-C (4.56 +\/- 0.50 vs. 3.11 +\/- 0.34 mmol\/l; p &lt; 0.05) and dense LDL2-C (1.86 +\/- 0.27 vs. 1.42 +\/- 0.17 mmol\/l; ns). Serum vitamin E was reduced during hypolipidemic therapy in the fraction of total, LDL1, LDL2, and VLDL-cholesterol. However, the ratio of serum vitamin E\/total serum cholesterol (4.57 +\/- 0.32 vs. 5.12 +\/- 0.37 mmol\/l\/mmol\/l; p &lt; 0.05) and ratio of LDL2-C vitamin E\/LDL2-C (3.92 +\/- 0.07 vs. 4.64 +\/- 0.37 mmol\/l\/mmol\/l; p = 0.08) increased in comparison to pre-treatment values. We conclude that pravastatin therapy may possess anti-atherogenic properties which involve not only its hypocholesterolemic effect, but also its favorable effects on the distribution of LDL subclasses and the content of antioxidant vitamin E in atherogenic lipoproteins.","793":"Experiments were carried out in the genetically hypertensive obese rats of Koletsky type (SHR\/N-cp obese), in their lean siblings (SHR\/N-cp lean) and in the rats of Han-Wistar strain. The effect of long lasting terguride treatment was monitored when the animal represents a control for itself. Blood was sampled to heparinized capillaries from retrobulbar plexus in the same animal before and after the terguride treatment. Long lasting terguride treatment shows decrease in \"area under the glucose tolerance curve\" in all groups of animals, increase in glycaemia in normotensive males, increase in insulinemia in normotensive rats of both sexes and in SHR\/N-cp lean males and decrease of insulinemia in SHR\/N-cp obese males, increase of triglyceridemia in normotensive rats of both sexes and in SHR\/N-cp lean males, and decrease of triglyceridemia in SHR\/N-cp lean females and SHR\/N-cp obese of both sexes, increase in cholesterolemia in normotensive and SHR\/N-cp lean males, decrease in cholesterolemia in normotensive, SHR\/N-cp lean and obese females. Thus ambivalent effect of terguride treatment is more expressive in glucose tolerance and in plasma triglycerides. Ambivalent effect of long lasting terguride treatment is profoundly expressed in correlation between pre-treatment state of individual parameters and the effect of treatment expressed in percentage changes in post-treatment state. In all cases statistically significant correlation coefficients show negative mark. Thus it is apparent that terguride increases monitored parameter when this parameter is low before treatment, and vice versa. When it is considered \"area under the glucose tolerance curve\", significance was attained in all groups, when judging basal glycaemia, significance was attained in normotensive and SHR\/N-cp lean rats of both sexes, taking into account insulinemia, significance was attained in normotensive and SHR\/N-cp obese rats of both sexes, when analysing plasma triglycerides, significance was attained in normotensive rats of both sexes and in SHR\/n-cp lean females and obese males, when we consider total plasma cholesterol, significance was attained in normotensive rats of both sexes and in SHR\/N-cp lean males. From the clinical point of view it must be underlined that terguride is potent to increase insulinemia. Thus there is open a possibility of the other clinical indication of the mentioned drug.","794":"Using Rat-401 monoclonal antibody and peroxidase immunohistochemistry we have detected IF nestin in developing and adult rat tissues. Although epitope recognized by Rat-401 antibody is relatively resistant to aldehyde fixation and paraffin embedding, the embedding of tissue samples into polyester wax and microwave antigen retrieval of histological sections enabled us to enhance sensitivity of immunohistochemical detection and to identify cells expressing low levels of nestin. Our findings confirm that nestin is predominantly distributed in developing neural, myogenic and mesenchymal cells, i.e. cell types that have been previously described to express this intermediate filament. Furthermore, we made original findings on identification of nestin expression in additional cell types, e.g. newly formed endothelial cells of extra- and intraembryonic blood vessels, epithelial cells of the developing lens, and cells apposed to to hair follicles.","795":"Activity of alkaline phosphatase in the major salivary glands of male and female mice at various ages of postnatal life, and in females during lactation was studied histochemically. Enzyme activity was not detected on the day of birth, but was found in the terminal tubules of all major salivary glands during the first postnatal week. Alkaline phosphatase activity was increasing gradually with age and a definitive enzymatic pattern was observed by the age of 6 weeks. No difference in enzyme activity was found among the major salivary glands of young adult and old animals. The parenchyma of fully differentiated submandibular glands showed clear sexually dimorphic patterns of alkaline phosphatase activity. During pregnancy, a significant increase of alkaline phosphatase activity was detected in submandibular gland. From gestation day 15 to the end of pregnancy, enzymic pattern of granular convoluted tubules of pregnant females was the same as in the adult males. Histochemical masculinization of the submandibular gland during pregnancy suggests that besides androgens also progesterone exerts masculinization of the murine submandibular salivary gland.","796":"","797":"An incidence of bilateral gonadoblastoma in a 23-month old, mentally retarded boy with congenital sporadic aniridia, undescended dysgenetic testes, deletion of a chromosome (11) (p1302p14.2) and a later occurring unilateral Wilms' tumor is reported. The patient was treated by bilateral gonadectomy, nephrectomy, and chemotherapy, and is alive and well five years later. Another three aniridia\/gonablastoma observations from the literature are discussed, two of them without and one in combination with Wilms' tumor. Diagnosis of gonadoblastoma remained unsuspected in two cases until autopsy and in another two cases it was done at surgery. A comparison of four cases reveals common finding--aniridia, dysgenetic gonads, genital abnormalities, mental retardation, deletion of 11p13, early occurrence and bilaterality of gonadoblastoma.","798":"In physiology, the mean arterial pressure is defined as an average pressure during one or several cardiac cycles. When calculus is not used, the mean pressure is approximately calculated as the diastolic pressure plus one third of the pulse pressure. In this article it is demonstrated that, when ventricular systolic work is concerned, the above definition of mean pressure must be replaced by a weighted average during the ejection phase of the systole. This gives a formula, by which a much higher estimate of the mean pressure is obtained.","799":"Red cell distribution width (RDW) was examined in 18 patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), in 5 patients treated with Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and in 9 patients subjected to splenectomy. Out of 18 patients treated with 2-CdA one patient was excluded of the study because of association of HCL with acquired sideroblastic anemia. In the remaining 17 patients the mean value of RDW before therapy was 18.8% (range 13.5% to 25.0%) and dropped after successful therapy after 6 to 12 months to the mean value of 13.6% (range 11.2% to 17.9%) and after 18 months to 13.4% (range 12.6% to 14.7%) (p = 0.00015 and p = 0.00049 respectively). The hemoglobin level increased from the mean value of 119 g\/l (range 99 g\/l to 157 g\/l) before therapy to the mean value of 145.9 g\/l (range 127 g\/l to 172 g\/l) after 6 to 12 months and after 18 months to 147.8 g\/l (range 132 g\/l to 168 g\/l) (p = 0.000017 and p = 0.00036 respectively). The same trend was observed in the group of patients treated with IFN-alfa. The RDW decreased from the mean value of 21.3% (range 18.8% to 28.7%) to the mean value of 15.3% (range 12.4% to 16.7%), (p = 0.031). The hemoglobin level increased in this group of patients from the mean value of 115 g\/l (range 98 g\/l to 127 g\/l) to the mean value of 136 g\/l (range 127 g\/l to 146 g\/l) (p = 0.031). In 9 patients in complete hematologic remission 34 to 293 months after splenectomy the mean value of RDW was 13.9% (range 13.0% to 15.5%). Increased RDW in HCL is associated with active disease and is reversible after successful therapy. This phenomenon has not been reported in the literature yet. Preliminary results show that the increase of RDW may be due to the dyserythropoiesis. ","800":null,"801":"Experiments were performed in the genetically hypertensive obese rats of Koletsky type (SHR\/N-cp) and in their lean siblings. The effect of long lasting terguride treatment on glycide and lipid metabolism was monitored. Terguride decreases insulinemia in all groups of rats. In all groups of rats terguride increases tolerance glucose. Terguride increases insulin binding to erythrocytes in all groups of rats except SHR\/N-cp obese females. The mentioned drug decreases plasma triglycerides in SHR\/N-cp obese females. On the other hand, this drug increases plasma triglycerides in SHR\/N-cp obese males. Correlation between basal glycemia and insulin binding to erythrocytes as well as between triglycerides and insulinemia which was found in control SHR\/N-cp lean males is missing under the terguride treatment. Similarly, correlation between plasma triglycerides and insulinemia, glucose tolerance and insulinemia, basal glycemia and insulinemia, plasma triglycerides and basal glycemia are missing under the terguride treatment in SHR\/N-cp lean females. Under the terguride treatment there appears correlation between insulin binding to erythrocytes and basal glycemia. We found in SHR\/N-cp obese males opposite changes in number of correlations when we compare control and terguride animals. While in controls only one correlation was detected, i.e., correlation between glucose tolerance and insulin binding to erythrocytes, then under the terguride treatment there appear correlations when basal glycemia is computed versus insulin binding to erythrocytes or to glucose tolerance and\/or to triglycerides. Moreover, there is under the terguride treatment correlation insulin binding to erythrocytes versus plasma triglycerides or versus insulinemia. While in SHR\/N-cp lean of both sexes and in SHR\/N-cp obese males profound changes in the number of statistically significant correlation coefficients were found when controls are compared with animals under the terguride treatment, the different picture we found in SHR\/N-cp obese females, i.e., under the terguride treatment correlation basal glycemia versus insulinemia or versus insulin binding to erythrocytes as well as correlation insulin binding to erythrocytes versus insulinemia is present in controls as well as in terguride treated animals. In comparison with controls under terguride only two correlations are missing, i.e., glucose tolerance versus insulinemia or versus insulin binding to erythrocytes.","802":"Based on reports that increased hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMN)-serotonin (5-HT) is associated with cancer anorexia and recent findings in our laboratory that low levels of dopamine (DA) in the VMN are associated with prolonged inter meal intervals thus decreased food intake, and reports that setting up satiation is concomitant with descending levels of DA in the rostromedial hypothalamus, we hypothesized that an elevated 5-HT to low DA ratio in the VMN modulates food intake in cancer anorexia. In Expt 1: A microdialysis cannula guide was placed stereotactically into the VMN of methylcholanthrene (MCA) sarcoma tumor-bearing (TB) Fischer rats and in non-tumor-bearing (NTB) and pair-fed (PF) controls. When TB rats manifested anorexia by a decrease in food intake, VMN-5-HT, its metabolite 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), and DA with its metabolite 3,4,-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were measured by in vivo microdialysis using HPLC during baseline, in response to food, and after feeding. In Expt 2: TB rats had tumor removed and VMN microdialysis performed 7 days later. Increased 5-HT release and turnover, and significantly reduced DA release with increased DOPAC occurred in TB vs NTB or PF rats. When food was offered, intake in TB rats was significantly lower than in NTB control rats. During eating, VMN-5-HT rose and peaked significantly earlier in TB vs NTB rats, while DA release was significantly reduced. With eating, the 5-HT and DA metabolism became reduced in all rats. Seven days after surgical removal of the tumor, 24 h food intake had increased to the level of controls; and when food was offered during microdialysis, intake in TB rats increased (ns relative to control), but was not yet normal. VMN microdialysis showed that 5-HT was normal at baseline, as well as during and after eating, while DA remained depressed. The metabolic turnover of 5-HT and DA was significantly lower in TB-r and PF vs NTB rats. We conclude that increased 5-HT\/DA ratio is related to the development of cancer-induced anorexia.

Antidepressant pharmacotherapy is one of the treatment alternatives today. We compared efficacy and safety of citalopram versus clomipramine (serotoninergic antidepressants) in 6 weeks in double blind therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The second objective was to compare prolactin response to a fenfluramine challenge test before the treatment of patients and after 6 weeks of the treatment. In a sample of 14 patients we confirmed significant therapeutic response after 3 weeks of pharmacotherapy, better in obsession than in compulsion. We found low level of adverse effects in the first week of therapy--dry mouth, anxiety, nausea, somnolence, tremor, and sexual adverse events. There were no changes in the laboratory, test EEG, and ECG examinations. Fenfluramine challenge test showed statistically significant decrease of prolactin levels 1 hour after administration of fenfluramine. It was not observed after six weeks of the therapy. Statistically significant negative correlation between prolactin plasma levels at the 6th hour after administration of fenfluramine and obsession item of YBOC Scale was showed after the 3rd and 6th week of the therapy. The correlation was not observed for compulsion item YBOC Scale. Side effects observed during and after the challenge test were anxiety and nervousness and gastrointestinal problems, lasted from 1 hour to 10 hours. These preliminary result could support the idea, that obsessions and compulsions have not necessary the same biological background. The challenge paradigm appears to be a possible way to clarify the pathogenesis of OCD. Our study will continue.","806":"The effects of subchronical exposure to SO2 (400ppm, 3 hours daily, 28 days) on biochemical and hematological parameters were investigated in guinea pigs. Mostly no significant changes in the values of biochemical parameters and no significant changes in hematological parameters were found. The levels of investigated ions (K+, Na+, Cl-, Ca++, Mg++ and phosphates), proteins (albumines, globulines, total proteins), enzymes (LD, ALT, AST, CK) and other biochemical parameters (urea, creatinine, bilirubin) were not significantly different between groups, with the exception of a significantly higher ALP concentration in the exposed group as compared with controls (2.17 mukat and 1.85 mukat, respectively. It can be concluded that a subchronical exposure to sulphur dioxide mostly did not induce any definite changes in biochemical and hematological parameters in guinea pigs.","807":"The female Wistar rats were intoxicated (i.m.) with sarin, soman and VX in doses equal to 1xLD50 and pontomedullar areas of the brain were prepared, homogenized, centrifuged and in these samples, acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) activities were determined. In the same samples, AChE was separated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and AChE molecular forms were detected and densitometrically evaluated. In control animals, AChE was separated into four forms differing in their electrophoretic mobility and their quantitative content in the sample. The form with lowest electrophoretic mobility represent the main part of AChE activity constituting the whole enzymatic activity. Following intoxication with the nerve agents mentioned, the whole AChE activity in the pontomedullar area of the brain was decreasing in intervals of ten minutes (soman and sarin) or one hour (VX). The AChE activity at the time of death (or terminal stage) was represented 5-30% of controls. Molecular forms of AChE were inhibited in different extent: the form with lowest electrophoretic mobility was diminished to zero level while the form with the highest mobility was practically unaffected, independently on the type of nerve agent. From quantitative expression of percentage content of the forms vs their activity we can imply that value of the total AChE activity represent the \"mean\" activity of the forms determined.","808":"The measurement of CK-MB remains the test of choice for confirmation or exclusion of AMI and probably will remain the test of choice for routine diagnosis in the near future. Nowadays determination of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as a method relatively expensive and time-consuming should be restricted to clinical settings that really require their high specificity.","809":"","810":"21 aphakic eyes of 21 patients corrected by glasses (A-G) were examined 1 and 6 months before and after secondary intraocular lens implantation (SILI). Visual acuity (VA) was tested using Snellen chart and computerized method with Landolt rings (CL). Contrast sensitivity (CS) was measured using computerized Contrast sensitivity system 8010 in spatial frequencies from 0.74 to 29.55 c\/deg. Preoperative best corrected VA (BCVA) in A-G eyes was significantly lower in comparison with control group of the same age only using computerized method with Landolt rings. A reduction of BCVA by both methods at 1 month and its return to original values after 6 months were noted. Significantly lower values of CS were found in A-G patients before SILI compared to the control group of the same median age in spatial frequencies from 3.69 to 29.55 c\/deg.

Altogether 604 patients underwent 655 surgeries. Total lobectomy or total thyroidectomy represented the most common procedures. Due to a gentle surgical technique, which we call \"preparation\", good results were achieved in the morbidity of laryngeal recurrent nerve (permanent palsy in 0.6%), and in perioperative or postoperative bleeding (0.3% of wound revisions, 0.5% of blood transfusions). Postoperative hypoparythyroidism was found in 4.7% patients. There is no correlation between postoperative hoarseness and laryngeal recurrent nerve palsy. Laryngeal endoscopy immediately after surgery is the most valuable diagnostic procedure.","812":"The main aim of the present study was a search for a characteristic serum marker of inflammatory activity in the airways of asthmatics with difficult-to-control disease. Therefore, serum levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), serum low-affinity Fc Epsilon Receptor II (sFcER II), Interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) Immunoglobulin-E (IgE), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), serum Interleukin Receptor 2 (sIL-2R) and Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM-1) were measured in 2 groups of asthmatics: 1-26 patients with difficult-to-control asthma (DTCA), 2-22 asthmatics, minimally symptomatic (MSA). No significant difference in either measured parameters between the DTCA and MSA group in peripheral blood samples was found. The above mentioned serum markers of T- and B-cell activation as well as the serum ICAM-1 level are not sensitive enough to determine the type, activity and severity of the inflammatory process in the asthmatic airways. ","813":"Two series of experiments were performed. In the first one experiments were carried out in Koletsky genetically hypertensive lean female rats and in the normotensive female rats of Wistar strain. Glucose intolerance was induced by oligemic brain hypoxia (4 hours of occlusion of both common carotid arteries followed by 44 hours reperfusion). Brain water content were used as a marker of brain edema. Changes in insulinemia and specific insulin binding were used as expression of regulative mechanisms participating in modification of glucose tolerance. The effect of terguride (trans-dihydro-lisuride) was tested. Brain hypoxia induced glucose intolerance in both strains of rat but brain edema was found only in the normotensive females. Both abnormalities were alleviated by terguride treatment. Basal glycaemia was not changed either by the brain hypoxia or by terguride treatment, except normotensive female where brain hypoxia induced hyperglycaemia. The second series of experiments were carried out in the normotensive females. The arrangement of experiments was the same as in first series except omission of the final glucose tolerance test. Brain hypoxia causes increase in brain water content. The mentioned elevation of brain water content was alleviated by terguride treatment. Insulin binding to erythrocytes was not influenced by brain hypoxia. Terguride treatment shows decrease of insulin binding to erythrocytes. Brain hypoxia elevates insulinemia which was not alleviated by terguride treatment.","814":"The most frequent ocular findings in acute leukemia cases of children and two of our own observations are presented in this study.

The follow up period varied between 6 months and 37 months (median, 19 months). 8 patients were previously treated. The overall response in 15 evaluable HCL patients was 100%, with 87% complete hematological remissions including three patients with retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and one patient with leukemic infiltrates of the cornea: 13% of patients achieved partial hematological remission.

The changes of cholinesterase activity in rabbit blood, peripheral tissues and the central nervous system following transfusion of erythrocytes with soman inhibited acetylcholinesterase we were demonstrated. 2. After incubation with soman for 0.5 or 24 h, erythrocytes without acetylcholinesterase activity were injected to intact rabbits and cholinesterase activity in the erythrocytes, plasma, diaphragm, liver and various parts of the brain were evaluated 24 h following blood-transfusion. 3. When erythrocytes were incubated with soman for 24 h, no changes of cholinesterase activity in the rabbit following blood-transfusion were observed with an exception of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase. 4. When erythrocytes were incubated with soman for 0.5 h, a significant decrease in cholinesterase activity in the erythrocytes, plasma, diaphragm and liver following blood-transfusion was found. These data show that soman is able to release from erythrocytes and inhibit cholinesterase activities not only in vitro but also in vivo although the significant inhibition of cholinesterase activities by soman was only observed in the peripheral compartment.","818":"Experiments were performed in the genetically hypertensive lean males of Koletsky type. It was monitored the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatment on lipemia, glucose tolerance, insulinemia, insulin binding to erythrocytes, fat pads, body weight and pellet intake. DHEA was applied in two doses: 10 and 20 mg per kg b.w., i.p., for 11 days when glucose tolerance was monitored and for 21 days when the remaining parameters were analyzed. DHEA shows dose dependent decrease in changes of body weight over injection period, in plasma triglycerides and total plasma cholesterol, decrease being most expressed under the higher dose. High as well low of DHEA decreases the sum of glycaemia obtained 30, 60, 120 and 180 min after glucose loading (area under the curve) i.e., DHEA alleviates genetically based glucose intolerance. DHEA induced hypophagia under the higher dose treatment. Insulin binding to erythrocytes was not influenced by DHEA.","819":"","820":"Massive bleeding into pleural cavity after subclavian vein cannulation is a rather rare but very serious complication. Usually laceration of the venous wall is the cause. In patients where conservative treatment, i.e. pleural drainage, maintaining the circulatory volume, treatment of possible coagulopathy, etc. is ineffective, surgery has to be performed. Bleeding can be surgically managed either from posterolateral thoracotomy or direct subclavian vessel revision is possible after partial resection of the clavicle. Brachiocephalic vein bleeding can be approached and managed through median sternotomy. We present a case report of 22-year old man with hemothorax after subclavian vein cannulation. In our patient only complex surgical procedure enabled proper management of bleeding complication.","821":"The detection of organic acidurias is a part of our screening programme for inherited metabolic diseases.

The next step of the investigation, using 3) gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GS-MS) is reserved for more complicated and dubious analyses. In acutely sick patients and in the case of discrepancies between TLC results on the one hand, and clinical symptoms, supported by other laboratory findings on the other, the GC or GC-MS-analysis is performed immediately. Some examples of metabolic disorders, identified by this procedure, are presented.","822":"Anal fissure remains one of the most common proctologic problems. A number of reports have advocated the use of partial internal sphincterotomy as a treatment of chronic anal fissure. Our study shows the results of a retrospective analysis of our patients who underwent lateral internal sphincterotomy for the treatment of chronic anal fissure. To determine long time results we examined random sample of 75 operated patients. Apart from taking careful history and patient's assessment of the operation effect, the patients were investigated \"per rectum\", and even possibly rectoscopically. To asscertain suitability and also security of properly done internal sphincterotomy, we performed anorectal manometric examinations in 53 patients controlled. To conclude our results, we can state that in 9 (12%) patients controlled some subjective complaints or certain pathologic findings connected with anal fissure or sphincterotomy were found. None of the people from the set of ours suffered from any complaints, which can be taken as stool incontinency. In no patients any change in pressure measured by anorectal manometry indicating incontinency was proved.","823":"Effect of two anticonvulsants with different mechanism of action, i.e. alprazolam and ketamine, was tested in two types of seizure activity. The first one was induced by N-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-propoxyphenylethyl)-aziridine, the second one by pentylenetetrazol. While alprazolam alleviated both the minimal as well as major paroxysms, ketamine suppressed only major seizures. These effects are discussed in terms of the both N-methyl-D-aspartate and GABA receptors involvement.","824":"The effects of weekly intravenously administered a dithiol chelating agent-sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane-sulphonate (DMPS)-in a single dose of 50 mg\/kg\/week for 10 weeks on biochemical and haematological parameters were studied in rabbits. DMPS was well tolerated, an increase in body weight was similar in the DMPS-treated and control animals. DMPS caused significant decrease in plasma calcium and vitamin E concentrations at the end of the experiment. No significant differences in haematological parameters between the DMPS and control groups were observed. A significant decrease in magnesium content in myocardial tissue was observed in the DMPS-treated rabbits. The above-mentioned biochemical changes should be taken into account in studies of possible chelating and radical scavenging effects of DMPS in various pathological conditions.","825":null,"826":"We present our technique of performing endarterectomy of coronary arteries by means of injecting cardioplegic solution into the plane of dissection of the endarterium. This simple and gentle technique in combination with manual endarterectomy helps in separation of the core far into the periphery of the diseased vessel and thus helps to perform revascularization in patients with diffuse atherosclerotic changes. During the last 6 years (1991-1996) endarterectomy in coronary revascularization was used in 116 cases (it was 5.7 % (116\/2031) of all myocardial revascularization procedures). On right coronary artery endarterectomy was used in 82 patients. Mortality rate in our group of patients was 4.88 % (4\/82) and perioperative myocardial infarction developed in 4.88 % (4\/82). According to our own experience with this technique of endarterectomy on right coronary artery we are convinced that in desperate patients with diffuse coronary artery disease our method can bring better and wider application of surgical treatment.","827":"Severe acute response, the synthesis of human acute-phase proteins and the increase of plasma cytokines and adhesion molecules occur in patients in the course of acute myocardial infarction. We examined the plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), plasma creatinkinase (CK) and C-reactive protein (C-RP) levels in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the course of 96 hours. Venous blood samples were taken at 3-hour intervals during the first 48 hours, and at 6-hour intervals during the next 48 hours. All patients were treated using thrombolytic therapy (streptokinase). Detection of the reperfusion was based on the method of measuring the time to achieve peak serum creatinkinase activity. The study was done on a group of 24 patients. Plasma levels of the parameters were compared between the group of patients with expected reperfusion versus the group of patients in which reperfusion is not suggested. The plasma TNF alpha level was elevated constantly without any significant peak. The mean plasma TNF alpha concentration was 46.8 pg\/ml, SD 2.13, vs. normal level 4.35 pg\/ml, p &lt; 0.001. The plasma TNF alpha level in the group of patients with reperfused coronary artery showed a significant decrease especially during the 3rd and 4th day (the mean peak plasma TNF alpha concentration was 35.2 pg\/ml, SD 15.8, vs. 66.9 pg\/ml, SD 38.3 pg\/ml, p &lt; 0.005). The plasma C-RP levels were elevated throughout the time of observation in the both groups. The elevation of the plasma C-RP levels was more significant in the group of patients without successful reperfusion (80.6 mg\/ml, SD 31.2, the mean plasma C-RP level of the group of the patients with successful reperfusion was 45.7 mg\/ml, SD 18.1, p &lt; 0.005). We conclude, that TNF alpha can play a role in the mechanisms of tissue injury. The successful reperfusion of coronary artery leads to significant decrease of plasma TNF alpha and C-RP levels.","828":"Experiments were carried out in the genetically hypertensive obese rats of Koletsky type (SHR\/N-cp) and in their lean siblings. Regression analysis was performed when plasma triglycerides was used as a dependent variable and plasma insulin, insulin binding to erythrocytes, basal plasma glucose tolerance data were used as independent variables. Coefficient determination (R2) as well as the tests of hypotheses of regression coefficients being zero were used to indicate which independent variables contributed the least in the explanation of dependent variable. This way we reduced the list of variables to give a simpler regression equation. In the control animals insulinemia was found to be dominant independent variable in all groups except SHR\/N-cp obese females where the dominant independent variable was represented by the basal plasma glycaemia. Under the terguride treatment only in SHR\/N-cp female rats the dominant independent variable remained the same as in controls. In the other groups the dominant independent variable was different in relation to the control animals. Long lasting terguride treatment normalized hypertriglyceridemia only in SHR\/N-cp obese females. Thus the data obtained by multiple regression analysis of parameters of lipide and glycide metabolism show the close relationship to alleviating effect of terguride in hypertriglyceridemia.","829":"The field of immunohistochemistry comprises histological methods enabling detection of tissue antigens via specific antibodies. Although all these techniques take an advantage of a large specificity of antibody to a particular tissue antigen there are many different approaches for enhancement and visualization of the signal. The aim of the present review article was to briefly outline the historical milestones that made the rapid progress of this discipline possible and give a comprehensive survey of immunohistochemical methods applicable to biomedical research. The survey starts with a description of the direct immunohistochemical method and then pays attention to a huge number of indirect methods. For better explanation of principles of individual techniques, the text is accompanied with graphical schemes. The highest attention is given to immunohistochemical methods that are most generally used, i.e. enzyme anti-enzyme complex methods (e.g. Peroxidase Anti-Peroxidase\/PAP\/ or Alkaline Phosphatase Anti-Alkaline Phosphatase \/APAAP\/) and methods based on avidin-biotin interactions (Bridged Avidin-Biotin\/BRAB\/, Avidin-Biotin Complex \/ABC\/, Labelled Avidin-Biotin\/LAB\/). Nevertheless, the principles of other immunohistochemical methods like two- or three-step indirect immunohistochemical methods, methods based on protein A-antibody interaction and Hapten Antibody Anti-Hapten method (HAAH), are also thoroughly characterized. Usefulness of each method for a specific utilization, its advantages and disadvantages are mentioned and compared with the latest immunohistochemical techniques, like Multi-Layered Peroxidase-Labelled Antibody (MLP) and water soluble polymer conjugates, e.g. Enhanced Polymer One-Step staining (EPOS) or EnVision. The last paragraphs are devoted to immunohistochemical amplification systems (Catalyzed Signal Amplification\/CSA\/ and label anti-label) that dramatically increase sensitivity of detection systems and enable to compare sensitivity of immunohistochemical methods with the most sensitive methods of molecular biologists.","830":"The article describes the most important features of the computer network Internet.

Acute haemodynamic effects of i.v. diltiazem in a single dose of 0.5 mg\/kg and the distribution of diltiazem in selected tissues was measured four weeks after surgical imposition of myocardial infarction in urethane (1.2 g\/kg i.p.) anaesthetized rats. Hypotensive effect of diltiazem was significantly (r = 0.624) attenuated with an increasing infarction size. A significant relationship (r = -0.697) between change in stroke index and infarction size was observed. In rats with small infarctions (&lt; 32% of the left ventricle circumference) there was an absolute increase, and in rats with large infarctions (&gt; 32%) there was an absolute decrease in the stroke index. From the results obtained it seems likely that dilatation of ventricles without appropriate hypertrophy accompanying large infarctions is one of the main determinants of manifestation of negative inotropic potential of diltiazem.","834":"This paper summarizes present views on effects of soman (O-pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate) and on possibilities of treatment of intoxication with this highly toxic compound. Simultaneously, it indicates the problems need to be solved. On this base only, it will be possible to improve the therapy of soman intoxication which is not sufficiently effective at present.","835":"Hibernating myocardium is defined as persistently impaired myocardial and left ventricular function at rest resulting from reduced myocardial blood flow. It is postulated that despite the reduced coronary blood flow, metabolic activity is sufficient to prevent tissue necrosis. Recovery of the hibernating myocardium has clearly been shown to occur with the establishment of successful revascularization either by coronary bypass surgery or by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The differentiation of viable, hibernating myocardium from non-viable myocardium in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction is a key issue in the current era of myocardial revascularization.","836":"A short history of the early development of the first European tissue bank dealing with the legislation, organization, manufacturing of 12 kinds of tissue graft preserves used in four continents, education, research, organization of scientific meetings and publications is given. Mentioned are also other branches of biological objects banking attached to the tissue bank.","837":"Diseases of the ear, nose and throat influenced or played an important role in the lives of painters (D. Ghirlandaio, L. da Vinci, L. van Leyden, J. Reynolds, F. Goya, V. van Gogh), composers (L. van Beethoven, B. Smetana, G. Puccini, M. Ravel, J. Jezek), writers or poets (W. Shakespeare, O. Wilde), statesmen (Francis II, John VI., G. Washington, Frederick III, G.S. Cleveland, U.S. Grant, Edward VII, A. Hitler, F.D. Roosevelt) or other famous persons (M. Luther, T. Brahe, H. Schliemann, T.A. Edison, S. Freud, G.S. Patton, E. Rommel, etc.). The aim of this paper is to remind us of and also to enrich our knowledge about the specialization in which we are working everyday.","838":"Under the influence of D. Armstrong, R. Burns, S. Kaufman, author proposed his own method of verbal-graphic diagnostics of children's experience with painful interventions in hospital. Child or adolescent characterizes actual and ideal psychosocial environment during painful interventions by kinetic drawing and writing comments. Children's drawings were analyzed by means quantitative and qualitative indicators set. Research sample consisted of 13 children and adolescents (median 12 years) hospitalized at the Pediatric Clinic of University Hospital. Results indicate that for an ill child apparently is not so stressing the painful intervention itself as the circumstances under which it is performed (inadequate preparation of the child, impersonal environment, absence of significant others and social support).","839":"Toxicities expressed as LD50 values of O-alkyl S-(2-dialkylaminoethyl) methyl phosphonothiolates in different species and different routes of administration were determined. Rats were more sensitive to these compounds than mice, rabbits and guinea-pigs were more sensitive than mice and rats. The most sensitive to these compounds were dogs. LD50 values varied in a wide range, however, a decrease of toxicity was observed in the following rank: i.v., i.m., s.c., i.p., p.o. and p.c., respectively. Depending on the route of administration, LD50 values varied from 5 g\/kg (i.m., dogs) through tens of microgram\/kg for the most part of compounds and routes of administration to hundreds, rarely thousands of g\/kg (some chemicals, p.c. administration).","840":"L-carnitine (CRT) is known to enhance penetration of some drugs of chemical groups across biological barriers. The aim of the study is to contribute to the problem of influencing the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) under CRT administration. In the case of validity of this presumption, CRT would be able to increase some effects of the central analeptic drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Two different experimental schedules were chosen in respect of PTZ administration. The first one was an administration of a high convulsive dose of 100 mg\/kg PTZ, the second one was a repeated administration of low (i.e., subconvulsive) doses of PTZ. CRT increased the total score of abnormal signs induced by a convulsive dose of PTZ. Moreover, CRT was able to accelerate the development of kindling induced by repeated administration of low doses of PTZ.","841":null,"842":null,"843":"","844":"Viscosity was determined in a series of 1402 paraproteinemic sera. Viscosity was measured on an ultrasonic viscosimeter of domestic design and was expressed in relative units(ru). Increased viscosity over 2.1 ru was found in 288 sera, i.e. 20.5%. Clinical symptoms of the hyperviscosity syndrome were found in 44 cases (3%) with viscosity over 4.0 ru. Malignant monoclonal gammopathy as proved in all 44 cases. In 17 determinations with the presence of paraprotein IgM, the mean viscosity was 6.35% +\/- 2.6 ru, and the mean paraprotein concentration was 41.12 +\/- 11.26g\/l. In 17 cases we found paraprotein IgG with a mean viscosity of 6.38 +\/- 2.4 ru and a mean concentration of paraprotein was 63.66 +\/- 14.52g\/l. In 9 determinations with the presence of paraprotein IgA, the mean viscosity as 5.22 +\/- 1.02 ru and the mean paraprotein concentration was 49.77 +\/- 13.89g\/1. In one case we found a double paraproteinemia of IgG-lambda + IgA-kappa (31.9 + 24.2g\/l), with a viscosity of 10.5 ru.","845":null,"846":null,"847":"1 The toxicity of pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate (soman, GD), cyclohexyl methylphosphonofluoridate (cyclohe xylsarin, GF) and 2-dimethylaminoethyl-(dimethylamido)-phosphonofluoridate (GV) and the therapeutic efficacy of two oximes (obidoxime and HI-6) in combination with atropine against mentioned nerve agents were evaluated in mice. 2 The 24-h i.m. LD50 of GD was 101 micrograms\/kg (99.5-104.0), LD50 of GF was 170 micrograms\/kg (151.0-190.0 and LD50 of GV was 25.2 micrograms\/kg (23.0-27.7). 3 The efficacy of two oximes, obidoxime (15 and 30 mg\/kg) or HI-6 (15 and 30 mg\/kg) in combination with atropine (21 mg\/kg) was tested. HI-6 was significantly more effective in reducing mortality than obidoxime following poisoning with all three nerve agents. 4 Higher doses of both oximes showed significantly more effective therapeutic efficacy against all nerve agents studied.","848":"In 28 patients with liver cirrhosis, pre- and post-TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic porta-caval shunt), pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (PREPs) and motion-onset visual evoked potentials (M-VEPs) examinations, EEG spectral analysis and Number Connection Test were performed. The M-VEPs (representing an activity of the magnocellular system of the visual pathway and reactions of the mediotemporal associate visual area) displayed the highest sensitivity (latencies delay) for detection of subclinical hepatic encephalopathy. The PREPs (originating in the primary visual cortex -area striata) were not significantly changed in comparison with a group of age matched controls. The EEG frequency spectrum exhibited significant slowing of the dominant frequency which was more pronounced in the post-TIPS examination. Combined analysis of the M-VEPs latency and EEG dominant frequency seem to be a recommendable method for early detection and objective classification of subclinical hepatic or portosystemic encephalopathy.","849":"Genetically unmodified neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from rate embryonic cortex were stimulated with Long-epidermal growth factor in vitro to form multicellular neurospheres. In our study, histology and transmission electron microscopy was for the first time utilized for analysis of three-dimensional neurospheres. Immunohistochemical phenotypization carried out on paraffin-embedded section revealed that most cells in the neurosphere expressed high levels of vimentin that is normally found in immature neural cells. Majority of glial cells expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) that is a specific marker for differentiated astrocytes. On the other hand, myelin basic protein (MBP), a marker of oligodendrocytes, was found only in a discrete subpopulation of glial cells. Similarly, electron microscopy recognized only rate myelin sheaths surrounding axons. Some cells displayed neuron-like morphology and were labelled with antibodies recognizing the neuronal antigens: 210 kDa neurofilaments (NF 210) and microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2). Surprisingly well-developed interneuronal synapses were found electronmicroscopically. The presence of synaptic vesicles was also confirmed by immunohistochemical detection of synaptophysin. Our results show that NPCs in neurospheres gradually differentiate into glial and neuronal cells.","850":"The measurement of soluble interleukin-2 receptor in serum has been shown to be useful in a variety of clinical conditions. In autoimmune disorders sIL-2R level correlates with the disease activity and reflects in-vivo immune system activation. Markedly elevated sIL-2R levels were found in certain hematologic malignancies such as adult T-cell leukemia and hairy cell leukemia. In hairy cell leukemia it reflects the tumor burden and response to therapy and can be used as a reliable non-invasive marker of disease activity. The sIL-2R levels at diagnosis predict reliably prognosis in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and in Hodgkin's disease."},"articletitle":{"0":"Oral Ibandronate Therapy in Three Patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta.","1":null,"2":"Spindle Cell Lipoma Occurring in the Submandibular Space: Fifth Case Reported along with a Concise Review of the Literature.","3":"Chondroblastoma of the Temporal Bone: A Case Report and Literature Review.","4":"Laparoscopic Right Hemicolectomy for Appendiceal Mucocele.","5":"Obesity in Children with Leptin Receptor Gene Polymorphisms.","6":"Gene Expression of Antioxidant Enzymes in the Resected Intestine in Crohn's Disease.","7":"A Comparison of the Neuroprotective and Reactivating Efficacy of a Novel Bispyridinium Oxime K870 with Commonly Used Pralidoxime and the Oxime HI-6 in Tabun-Poisoned Rats.","8":"Restless Leg Syndrome and Sleep Disorders in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Its Relation with Anemia Parameters.","9":"Failure of Warfarin Anticoagulation Therapy after Administration of Oral Terbinafine.","10":"Association of Tortuous Common Carotid Artery with Abnormal Distribution of the Ansa Cervicalis: A Case Report.","11":"The Difficult Path to Correct Diagnosis of Hepatolithiasis: A Case Report.","12":"Reference Values for Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in Young Male Slovak Athletes.","13":"Rasch Validation of the LVQOL Scale.","14":"Iatrogenic Fracture of the Lower Jaw: A Rare Complication of Lower Molar Extraction.","15":"Genotype Associations with the Different Phenotypes of Atopic Dermatitis in Children.","16":"Unintentional Opioid Overdoses Treated at University Clinic of Toxicology-Skopje in a Nine-Year-Period.","17":"The Effect of Lactobacillus casei on Experimental Porcine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Induced by Dextran Sodium Sulphate.","18":"Innervation Patterns of the Pronator Teres Muscle and Their Possible Role in Neurotization: A Systematic Review of Cadaveric Studies.","19":"Exogenous Intake of Fluorides in Caries Prevention: Benefits and Risks.","20":null,"21":"Horseshoe Kidney Complicated by Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis in a Young Girl: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.","22":"Peritoneal Pseudocyst Causing Acute Abdomen as a Complication of Cronh's Disease.","23":"Hirata's Disease: Rare Cause of Hypoglycaemia in Caucasian Male.","24":"Rare Complication of Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Extension of Retroperitoneal Abscess into Femoral Region.","25":"Ovotesticular Disorder of Sexual Development and Non-Palpable Testis.","26":"A Case Series of Malignant Otitis Externa Mimicking Malignancy.","27":"Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy for Obstructive Hydrocephalus and Ventriculocystostomy for Intraventricular Arachnoid Cysts.","28":"Diagnostic Value of Narrow Band Imaging in Visualization of Pathological Lesions in Larynx and Hypopharynx.","29":"Urban or Rural GP?
