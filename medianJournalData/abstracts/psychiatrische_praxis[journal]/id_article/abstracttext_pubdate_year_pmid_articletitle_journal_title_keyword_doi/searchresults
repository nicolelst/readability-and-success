What do we know about the effectiveness of housing interventions? Methods Systematic literature search for RCTs. Results Few RCTs, almost exclusively with homeless individuals were conducted.

There are no clear results yet regarding the effectiveness of different housing interventions compared with each other.

Future studies should address the housing needs of people who are at risk of getting homeless and of people living in inadequate housing.

The results were evaluated for frequency, mean value and correlations. Relevant data is now available for duration, organisation and intensity of treatment, room and personnel.

Methods: 595 cognitively unimpaired individuals who participated in the Leipzig Longitudinal Study of the Aged (LEILA75+) were regularly interviewed and cognitively tested over 8 years. Cox regression analyses were used to determine the association of SCD and development of dementia. Results: SCD at baseline was not associated with an increased dementia risk when adjusted for covariates. By contrast, subtle deficits on cognitive testing, though within a normal range, indicated higher dementia risk. Conclusion: SCD is not a clear indicator for the development of dementia. However, individuals who exhibit subtle deficits on cognitive tests, though within the normal range, should be monitored closely as they might be at increased risk for dementia.","345":null,"346":null,"347":null,"348":null,"349":null,"350":null,"351":null,"352":null,"353":null,"354":null,"355":"Objective: In the treatment of patients with alcohol dependence it is next to physical detoxification under protected conditions to promoting abstinence motivation.

In this context, the question arises whether certain working conditions do act as depressogenic stressors. We systematically reviewed cross-sectional and prospective studies (published since 2005) investigating the association between working conditions and the occurrence of depression. Moreover, meta-analyses on reported effect sizes were calculated. Our meta-analyses confirmed a depressogenic effect of high job demands and the combination of high demands and low job control (\"Job Strain\"). We did not find an effect of low job control alone. The impact of these working conditions is modulated by contextual factors like occupational grade or cognitive coping strategies. Based on these results, we suggest an extended model of working conditions, coping capacities, and their relation to the development of depression. This can be utilized for strategies of occupational prevention and individual therapy.

Though several instruments that assess functional capacity were found in our search, a specific validated instrument assessing occupational capacity as part of a larger psychiatric evaluation was not found. The limitations of the existing instruments on assessing functional capacity are discussed. Medical experts relying on instruments to conduct functional capacity evaluations should be cognizant of their limitations.

Analyzing three cases from the supervision practice of the author ethical conflicts in psychiatric care are described and discussed. Ethical conflicts in psychiatric care mostly concern the conflict between patient autonomy and the need of psychiatric treatment, questions about professional role, but also the question of equitable utilization of limited treatment resources. In each of the discussed cases it can be asked, how far the patient is able to understand the benefits and necessity of treatment and provide consent and the possible consequences of non-treatment. Supervision can be a useful means of addressing and reflecting on ethical conflicts in psychiatry. As a common process of the team it can argue and prepare treatment decisions and strengthen the ethical orientation among the staff. Because of the more open process and the long-term professionalization attitude it can support but not replace more formal and highly structured ethical consultation in critical cases and the establishment of ethic commission, ethic codices and rules in psychiatric institutions.

Explorative survey as pilot study by questionnaire with clinical staff, quantitative (descriptive) and qualitative (coding) data-analysis. Involuntary treatment, the relationship between healthcare professionals and patients, staff shortage and the collaboration between the professions as well as dealing with patient relatives came up as ethical challenges. Clinical Ethics Support in psychiatric patient care should not only cover aspects that are specific for psychiatry, but also structural topics such as short resources, interprofessional collaboration and communication with relatives.

Systematic literature search in data bases (PubMed, Web of Knowledge, SpringerLink, PubPsych, PsychSpider und PsycINFO) against the background of practical experiences with pilot model of implementation of Ethics Consultation in one psychiatric university hospital. Reports on Ethics Consultation in Psychiatry were published only sporadically. This is contrasted by recent experiences showing considerable needs for ethics support in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Adult as well as Forensic Psychiatry. This somewhat \"late\" development of Ethics Consultation in Psychiatry (compared with somatic medicine) might have structural reasons (lacking resources), be related to strong compensatory competencies of psychiatric staff, esp. regarding communication or legal knowledge, but could also relate to an under-estimation (\"under-diagnostic\") of ethical problems in psychiatric patient care - both, in the eyes of psychiatric insiders, as well as seen from the outside. Needs for model projects and accompanying research on Ethics Consultation in Psychiatry. Proved in practice: patient- as well as team-oriented ethics support.

The study aims to identify weight-related stigmatizing attitudes of mental and somatic health care professionals. The data base was derived from a survey of 773 health care professionals using a vignette-based approach. Stigmatizing attitudes were assessed with the Fat Phobia Scale. Health care professionals in the somatic and mental health field stigmatize overweight individuals. Stigmatizing attitudes were associated with the belief in the lack of willpower of obese people and an increased perceived workload caused by overweight patients. The stigmatization of obese people needs to be addressed and mentally ill patients seem to be an especially vulnerable group due to double stigma.

Based on the finding that patients who ask for medical assistance in suicide often have in mind the loss of their mental capacity, we submit PAS to an ethical analysis and put it into a broader context of patient autonomy at the end of life. In doing so, we point to advance care planning, through which the patient autonomy of the person concerned can be supported as well as respected in later stages of the disease. If patients adhere to their autonomous wish for PAS, physicians find themselves in an ethical dilemma. A further tabooing of the topic, however, does not provide a solution; rather, an open societal and professional ethical discussion and regulation are essential.","560":"To conduct a systematic review about existing evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions for depression in older adults. Electronic databases were systematic searched to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Psychotherapeutic interventions are effective for treating depression in the elderly. Psychotherapy is more effective at reducing depressive symptoms than being on a waiting list or treatment as usual. The strongest evidence exists for approaches of cognitive and behavioral therapy. In head-to-head studies comparing different psychotherapeutic approaches the majority of the interventions did not proof to be superior to others, so far. Psychotherapy is also an effective intervention for reducing depressive symptoms in older adults with sub-threshold depression. Psychological interventions could play an important role in the treatment of late-life depression. However, there is still a need for high-quality studies, in which especially very old adults, older adults with cognitive and sensory impairments or chronic somatic illnesses are included.

","562":"Psychiatry is distinguished from other fields of medical expertise and bears a particular kind of responsibility, namely the treatment of persons incapable of informed consent per se. The History of psychiatry shows that much too often inhuman abuse was happening in psychiatric facilities. An ethics of psychiatry therefore requires a reliable and stable foundation for values that allow justifying normative claims embracing both characteristics. Such a basic foundation already exists in form of the pluralistic and international recognition of human dignity. We argue that human dignity does and has to go beyond \"respect for autonomy\" and by that it can function as highest authority on questions concerning value judgments on critical cases in psychiatric bioethics.","563":"There is no specific psychiatric ethic. The ethical principles for practical actions in psychiatry have to be adapted on the basis of the generally accepted ethical principles, which are based on psychobiologically developed ethic of love: honesty, discretion, empathy, patience, distance, consistency, accountability, tolerance, economic neutrality.

Thus, the responsibility of the health-care elites to establish a sociopolitical framework that suits psychiatric ethics is discussed on the basis of a theory of the common good and of a philosophical and normative elite theory. \"Mental health\" is demonstrated to be part of a basic sphere of the common good which cannot be denied to any member of a society.

Psychiatric experts should be aware of the potential of misuse when defining what is real and what seems to be a delusion. ","570":"Doctors want to save lives and promote health. But their patients have the right to decide for themselves about what doctors do with them, and they are free to refuse treatment, even if it is unreasonable from a medical perspective. The law acknowledges this freedom even if a patient is incapable of responsible self-determination as a result of (mental) illness. Treatment contrary to the patient's declared intention will be allowed only under specific, narrow circumstances. These requirements must be legally established in a clear and precise manner.

Following an introduction on the history of DBS in psychiatry, this review summarizes commonly raised ethical concerns and questions on clinical trial design, selection of patients, informed consent and concerns about the possible impact of DBS on an individual's personality. Finally, it highlights the fact that critique on DBS in psychiatry is probably not selectively based on scientific concerns about potential risks; instead, the neurobiological origin of specific psychiatric disorders has been questioned.

Although it seems to be an almost inevitable ingredient of every day moral judgments, philosophers have difficulties to find an analysis of the concept that could support this central role. One way out of these difficulties consists in a closer look at the various areas where the concept is used so widely and naturally, in the attempt to extract inductively an adequate understanding of human dignity from these contexts. In the article, this strategy is used to glean features of human dignity from the history of psychiatry, condense them into a plausible understanding of human dignity and finally sketch some practical implications for modern psychiatric ethics.

After 150 years of increasingly unilateral medicalization with its fatal consequences for many patients the post war generation of psychiatrists were the first to re-establish the primary ambivalence. The ethical consequences of the anthropological renewal are being discussed respective to some practical situations: 1. The doctor - patient - relatives relationship embedding the activity of the interested parties; 2. mental disorders as relationship disorders; 3. ethical orientation towards the normative ambiguity of self-determination and \"being meaningful for others\"; 4. the consequences for the post-industrial concept of man; 5. the ethics of self-help groups; and 6. the challenge of inclusion for ethics and human rights.

Up to now, the majority of sexual offenders were assumed to be responsible for their actions and in most cases a forensic-psychiatric assessment was not required.

The latter approach focused on patients' subjective experience and biographical issues. Karl Jaspers emphasised social factors in the genesis and course of mental disorders. Following a multiperspective concept, from Jaspers' viewpoint social psychiatry should consider itself of equal importance with biological and psychotherapeutic psychiatry. Therefore, uncritical generalization of one of these perspectives should be avoided.

Chi-square tests, univariate ANOVAs and stepwise multivariate logistic regression models were applied. Compared with patients treated by office based psychiatrists, patients treated by the outpatient clinic showed higher HoNOS and CGI scores, lower GAF and PSP scores, and had more often a disability pension, a legal guardianship, a schizophrenia diagnosis, suicide attempts, hospitalizations, and therapeutic contacts. However, there were no significant differences regarding care satisfaction. The assessed outpatient clinic met the German statutory criteria for its legitimation.

Patient satisfaction is more often included in e-Health studies investigating the impact of e-Health applications on patient-reported outcomes, whereas patient-reported experiences are increasingly important.Given the diversity of e-Health applications and respective intended outcomes, it is concluded that the assessment of quality of life should become more context-sensitive and application-specific, including domains and facets that are specifically appropriate to e-Health settings. Moreover, patient-reported experiences (e. g. patient safety) should be taken into account.

The cut-off-scores were validated with respect to depression as an external criterion. Suitable cut-off-scores were identified for all subscales in both samples. The cases and non-cases according to the cut-off-scores differed significantly regarding the severity of depressive symptoms and the prevalence of depression. Good to very good sensitivity and specificity of the CTS-items and the related subscales of the CTQ are shown, except for the dimension \"physical neglect\".

Another problem is the deficient cooperation between psychiatry and child psychiatry. Therefore early recognition centers were founded, in Germany primarily with focus on psychosis and in research settings. The early recognition center in Dresden offers a low-threshold and anonym service for young people independent of diagnosis. The multiprofessional team including psychologists, psychiatrists and child psychiatrists applies defined standards. In addition to standard history taking and formally assessing psychopathology, early recognition instruments for psychosis and bipolar disorders are used as appropriate. In 167 out of 192 individuals a structured diagnostic procedure was recommended, 149 persons (89 %) completed the procedure. Thereof 78 (52 %) persons fulfilled criteria for one, 21 (14 %) persons for two and 10 (7 %) persons for three mental disorders. 49 (33 %) persons fulfilled criteria for (Ultra)high risk for psychosis and\/or bipolar disorders. In the majority of cases diagnostic criteria for at least one mental illness was already fulfilled. All diagnosis and stages from prodromal till chronic were represented.

A total number of 56 in-patients with a diagnosis of major depression were compared in terms of self-construals and their relations to different aspects of mental distress. Turkish patients exhibited a stronger interdependent self-construal compared to Germans, whereas no group differences were observed with respect to independence. While for Turkish patients a higher level of interdependence was associated with lower levels of mental distress, the reverse was true for German patients. However, there were no significant ethnic differences in the associations between independence and mental distress. The current study provides evidence that the relation between self-construal and mental distress is moderated by patient's cultural background. The findings have implications for integrating self-construals into psychotherapy practice with culturally diverse populations, in order to adjust therapy goals and intervention techniques.

A systematic search for relevant psychometric test publications in German language journals and textbooks was carried out. Three evaluation criteri a were considered: 1) theoretical foundation, 2) availability of actual test norms, 3) usual psychometric test validity and reliability criteria. The theoretical foundation of all of the psychological tests under review was found to be very weak. The norm values of some of the tests are outdated. Most of the psychological tests do not fulfill high quality standards of psychometric testing.

Labeling a depressive episode \"burnout\" increased from 0.3 % in 2001 to 10.2 % in 2011. Schizophrenia and alcohol dependence were labeled \"burnout\" far less frequently. Compared to the label \"depression\", \"burnout\" was associated with less desire for social distance, but also with less recommendation of psychotherapy, medication, and seeing a psychiatrist. While provoking less desire for social distance than \"depression\", using the label \"burnout\" carries the risk of increasing the proportion of untreated depressive episodes.

In an online-survey, the split-personality-belief, the stereotypes dangerousness and unpredictability\/incompetence and individual discrimination (i. e. desired social distance) of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia were assessed by self-report. The split-personality-belief was associated with increased perceived dangerousness, unpredictability\/incompetence and desired social distance. Both stereotypes mediated the relationship of split-personality-belief and desired social distance. The split-personality-belief is associated with and may even contribute to stigmatiziation of persons with schizophrenia.

Especially internalized stigma, the inner subjective experience of stigma and its psychological effects resulting from applying negative stereotypes and stigmatising attitudes to oneself, is a barrier to recovery. The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness-scale (ISMI) developed by Jennifer Boyd Ritsher and colleagues is a valid instrument for self-rated assessment of the subjective experience of stigma. The aim of the study was to examine the psychometric properties of the German Version of the ISMI among people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The ISMI was translated into German. Reliability and validity of the instrument were tested and predictors of internalized stigma were explored. Data of 157 people were collected on the ISMI and demographic and clinical variables. Construct validity was tested by comparing results with already established constructs such as perceived devaluation and discrimination, depression, self-esteem, empowerment, control convictions and quality of life. The German Version of the ISMI showed good psychometric properties with high internal consistency, good test-retest reliability and good construct validity among people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. About one third had a mean above the midpoint of the scale indicating a high level of internalized stigma. Internalized stigma was predicted by insufficient social network, level of education less than high school and inpatient or day clinic treatment compared to outpatient treatment. Results suggest that the German version of the ISMI is comparable to its original version. With the German version of the ISMI internalized stigma can be measured reliably and validly among people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Future studies may use the ISMI to record changes in internalized stigma pertinent to the achievement of therapeutic goals.

A retrospective cross-sectional study on 1,672 patients of a psychiatric outpatient clinic for the year 2010, based on 30 variables. Associations between variables were explored by means of robust multivariate regression models and polynomial regression plots. The patients' average CGI value was found to be 5.98, the mean GAF-score 47.3, and the mean duration of illness 13.8 years. A third of the sample attempted suicide in the past. Metabolic comorbidity was found in 23.1 % of the sample. Results of regression analyses reveal positive effects of the disease severity and functional impairment on the use of psychiatric care. Patients with affective and schizophrenic disorders received more units of care and caused more costs. Patients living in nursing homes received less in- and outpatient care but caused more medication costs. Study results support the assumption that German psychiatric outpatient clinics fulfill their statutory duties by treating severely chronically mentally ill patients. The patients' use of care is positively related to the disease severity and their functional impairment. However, results of the regression analyses suggest that patients living in nursing homes received less psychiatric care than patients who live more independently.

Therefore, we investigated if the risk of drug-drug interactions can be reduced by a consultant clinical pharmacist for the physicians on psychiatric wards. Drug-drug-interactions and adverse drug reactions of patients on 2 psychiatric intensive care units were investigated retrospectively in 2008 and 2009. Before the second investigation period, a special training was performed and during this period a pharmacist supported the physicians regarding drug therapy. After the introduction of a pharmacist on the ward and 2 teaching lessons relevant drug interactions were reduced by 78 % (p &lt; 0.001), the number of all interactions by 44 % (p &lt; 0.001). The total number of drug interactions decreased by the training sessions, which were offered shortly before starting the second observation period, from 3.4 interactions\/patients in 2008 to 2.2 interactions\/patients in 2009 (p &lt; 0.04). A clinical pharmacist on the ward can contribute to a higher drug therapy safety in psychiatric wards. An interdisciplinary approach can relieve the physicians' daily work.

This paper acknowledges this habilitation thesis in its historical context as an early contribution to East German social psychiatry. First the thesis itself is searched for points characteristic of Kohler's approach to social psychiatry. Parallel to that, her views are contextualised with other primary sources from or secondary sources about GDR psychiatry at that time. Finally archival sources and oral testimonies of eye witnesses have been considered to substantialise the study. The habilitation thesis is based on data from several hundreds of patients with regard to their demographic, medical and sociological features. Her approach to how older patients suffering from mental illnesses should be treated and rehabilitated is still highly relevant. Yet one must critically assess that many of Kohler's results as well as her psychotherapeutic treatment were ideology-based or oriented on the GDR system. Kohler's approach shows a clear, yet improper amalgamation of medical science and political ideology. Future research must show in how far this is typical for her concept only or for the whole of GDR social psychiatry. ","729":"In psychiatry and psychotherapy religion and spirituality were for a long time mainly considered as a pathological and neurotic phenomenon. Nowadays they are increasingly accepted as an independent dimension and resource. By means of a questionnaire, inpatients of 3 hospitals with schizophrenic (F2) or affective (F3) disorders were interviewed shortly before discharge about their religious and spiritual attitude with regard to therapy, coping with psychiatric disorder and hospital based pastoral care. General religiousness of the participants was measured using the centrality scale of the Structure of Religiosity Test. Of the 216 participants 25% rated themselves as not religious, 61% as religious, and 14% as highly religious. Diagnosis, education, sex, duration of illness and self-evaluation of current mental health status had no significant statistical impact on the importance of religion. Higher age and importance of religion were positively correlated. Hospital based pastoral services were perceived as very helpful. Results indicate positive effects of religiousness on coping with the psychiatric disorder. For three of four patients religion and spirituality play a more or less important role in their life. In a clinical as well as in a scientific context this dimension should be paid more regard in psychiatry and psychotherapy.

A population of n=105 \"high-risk-offenders\" suffering from psychiatric disorders treated in special outpatient aftercare facilities after release from inpatient treatment was followed using several documentation methods and by analyzing patients' criminal records. The population showed a very low criminal recidivism rate (2.0%, average time at risk: 3 years and 8 months). No case of heavy delinquency (violent or sexual offenses) was registered. Patients showed good psychopathological stability over the treatment period. Specialized aftercare of released forensic patients provides a considerable increase in public security. Patients are protected from psychopathological decompensation by professional supervision after release.

However, there is still insufficient knowledge about how people with mental illness view decisions, what kind of decisions are made and how patients experience and perceive the process of participation in routine care. A qualitative study with focus groups was conducted with patients with chronic mental illness currently receiving outpatient care (N=23). Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, coded and content analysed. Three main themes were extracted from the data: 1. perception of the clinician and participation, 2. process of communication and flow of information, 3. decisions and transfer. The perception of participation in the decision process depends on a good patient-doctor relationship. Decisions made in the course of an outpatient long-term treatment are complex and are often not made during one single appointment.

Only few significant correlations were found, with slightly higher scores in the AC patients. Also, AC patients rated themselves higher, whereas PC patients rated lower compared to the RAI ratings. The discrepancy between SRS and RAI scores decreased with rising work complexity and with a low symptom strain. With high GSI, SRS scores are clearly lower than RAI scores. The SRS-version of the O-AFP is not appropriate for economizing the assessment process. Rather, it is helpful in therapist-patient communication on issues of work rehabilitation.

Psychotherapists report an open approach to handling treatment errors: the majority claim that they would discuss errors with their patients.

Aim of the study is to compare routinely recorded data of mental health service use and direct cost of service use with sample data. We compared analyses of mental health service use and direct cost of service use with routinely recorded data with analyses using sample data. Concerning the year 2008, we joined these different data sets, processing them in order to obtain pseudonymity and fulfil data protection requirements. This joint data set maps the total expenditures for psychiatric care utilisation in this region. Using a data set of this kind, analyses of health economy are possible which are comparable or even superior to those from sample data.

Prospective longitudinal study of community dwelling elderly patients supplemented by a questionnaire answered by family members, as well as expert interviews with the members of the consultation-liaison team and semi-structured interviews with family members. The majority of patients had some benefit from the liaison psychiatric interventions, access to care was improved and lack of specialist support was reduced. In addition there was some cost offset due to prevention of admissions to nursing homes and inpatient hospital treatment.

","764":"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) belongs to the group of amyloidoses that are characterized by the deposition of insoluble and tissue-damaging amyloid proteins. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage is the common clinical presentation of CAA resulting from the degenerative effect of beta amyloid on the cerebral vascular system. Though CAA is rather a neurological disease psychiatric symptoms can occur and even dominate the clinical picture. A case report is presented in order to illustrate the association between CAA and psychiatric symptoms. We report the case of a 54-year-old female patient with radiologic references to a probable CAA and mild cognitive impairment who developed behavioural difficulties and personality change that necessitated a psychiatric treatment. Psychiatric symptoms were most likely due to CAA. CAA can be associated with psychiatric symptoms and hence should be considered in the treatment of elderly patients with behavioural problems or personality changes. Diagnostic neuroimaging and examination of cerebrospinal fluid is recommended. ","765":"Relatives of persons with schizophrenia have an essential role in informal caregiving. This may result in a high level of burden. Aim of the study was to investigate, if the frequency of unmet needs among relatives caring for schizophrenia patients increases the risk for burden among these relatives. 135 relatives of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were investigated by means of the \"Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire\" (IEQ) and the \"Carer's Needs Assessment for Schizophrenia\" (CNA-S). Multiple linear regression analyses showed positive associations between the frequency of caregivers' unmet needs and the IEQ-subscores \"tension\" and \"worrying\". Further, the IEQ-subscore \"worrying\" was significantly lower among caregivers of outpatients than among caregivers of inpatients or day hospital patients. The IEQ-subscore \"urging\" was significantly associated with patient's negative symptoms. Unmet needs among caring relatives have negative effects on their burden. Further, the patients' type of treatment setting (inpatient, outpatient, day hospital) seems to predict caregivers' burden. ","766":"With regard to changes in the German law of preventive detention--a sentence handed down to offenders who committed a grave offence and are considered a danger to public safety, similar to the preventive detention law in New Zealand--an online survey amongst forensic psychiatrists has been conducted between July and October 2011. Questions have been raised regarding the necessity of preventive detention, subsequent preventive detention (the possibility of imposing \"preventive detention\" after sentencing, which was ruled a violation of the European Convention of Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights), and the Therapy Placement Act from January 1st, 2011. Participants have been contacted via email and participation was anonymous. An online-platform has been established, and has been open for about four months. Most participants have been familiar with either court reports regarding preventive detention or the content of the Therapy Placement Act. Less than one third had already answered issues considering this new law. All participants have considered preventive detention as necessary, but subsequent preventive detention as well as the Therapy Placement Act as not required. The Therapy Placement Act was considered to be modified by involving an interdisciplinary advisory board. Terms of \"psychiatric disorder\" should be defined or replaced, and frequency of psychiatric assessment should be reduced. ","767":"Excessive internet use is being discussed as a non-substance-related addiction disorder. Estimations of its prevalence show that 1% of the German general population is affected by internet addiction. However, it is still unclear, whether internet addiction as a co-morbid disorder is also common among patients of the general health care system, especially in patients being treated in inpatient addiction rehabilitation centers. It seems plausible that these patients have a heightened proneness to co-morbid internet addiction. In order to address this issue, a government-funded cooperation project was conducted. Within six months every new patient admitted to one of 15 rehabilitation facilities was screened for internet addiction. 4.2% of the patients fulfilled criteria for internet addiction. Male patients of younger age with main diagnosis of cannabis dependence or pathological gambling were found to be at higher risk. Internet addiction is more common among patients of the rehabilitation system than in the general population. Especially young, male patients in treatment for cannabis dependence or pathological gambling are at risk for co-morbid internet addiction. It is recommended that regular screening for internet addiction should be implemented in facilities with patients at risk in order to offer indicative treatment. ","768":"Although gender differences are increasingly the focus of current research, gender aspects in the response to pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of depression still remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of gender on the outcome of a CBT-orientated multimodal treatment in depressed outpatients with chronic pain. A total of 298 patients (154 women) underwent a standardized five-week CBT-orientated multimodal treatment. Depressive symptoms were measured at the beginning and end of the treatment with the German version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The improvement of depressive symptoms showed an effect size (ES) of 0.81 in the total sample. However, women improved considerably more (ES 0.96) than did men (ES 0.65) and these gender differences are seen in the complete sample (t = 2.757, df = 296, p = 0.006) as well as in the group without received antidepressants (t = 2.325, df = 151, p = 0.021). Women with a depressive disorder and chronic pain benefit significantly more from a CBT-orientated multimodal treatment and exhibit a considerably greater reduction of depressive symptoms than do men. These distinctions are not due to differences in received antidepressant medication, psychiatric comorbidities or educational background.

New and current legal guardianships as well as involuntary admissions according to Guardianship Law and also to Commitment Law were examined from 1998 to 2010. All investigated variables (new and current legal guardianships as well as involuntary admissions) increased significantly along assessed period of time. Current guardianship rates are lower in urban area. On the other hand, rates of involuntary admissions according to Guardianship Law are in urban area 3fold higher and those according to Commitment Law doubled. New and current guardianships' ratio as well as ratio between involuntary admissions according Commitment Law and Guardianship Law remained quite stable. The large differences in legal guardianship policy and involuntary treatment between urban and rural regions cannot be explained on the basis of available data. The role of community-based care networks in the process of reducing involuntary admissions should be further examined.

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of fear of stigma including depression, anxiety and somatisation among patients with somatoform pain disorder. 132 patients with somatoform pain disorder were investigated by using the Link Stigma Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Whiteley-Index, and the Checklist for Somatisation. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant positive association between fear of stigma and symptoms of depression and a negative association with patients' age. This is one of the first studies investigating this question among patients with somatoform pain disorder. Findings might indicate the importance of depressive symptoms for developing fear of stigma.

The results were compared to a control group matched for sex, age, level of ID, and presence of autism spectrum disorder. We observed 3 categories of emotional developmental disorder: (1) Contact disorder (arrest in adaptation phase, 0-6 months, showing self injury, social withdrawal, stereotyped behaviors); (2) disintegrated disorder (arrest in socialization phase, 6-18 months, showing high irritability and aggression), and (3) disorganized disorder (arrest in individuation phase, 18-36 months, showing hyperactivity and attention seeking behavior). The individuals with emotional developmental disorders showed a significant increase in challenging behavior when compared to the control group, especially in terms of hyperactivity, irritability, and overall aggression, and were more often unemployed.

An analysis of administrative data was conducted to compare the geriatric outpatient diagnoses and the patterns of care dependency of 1,848 incident dementia patients and 7,385 matched non-dementia controls older than 65 years in the incidence year. In most cases the geriatric characteristics show an increased (partly statistically significant) prevalence in the group with dementia as compared to controls. Moreover, dementia patients show a higher number of geriatric comorbidities in contrast to non-dementia controls. Furthermore, the percentage of persons with need for long-term care in the dementia-group is significantly higher than for controls (44.4 vs. 12.9 %).

Therefore, this study examines the knowledge of german psychiatrists about the children of their patients and their attitude towards the youth welfare and prevention system. Seven psychiatric hospitals of one federal state in Germany participated in a questionnaire survey. The majority of the psychiatrists know whether their patients have children or not, but they can not answer differentiate questions of the children's life circumstances or name preventive programs for children and their families. Furthermore, psychiatrists potentially could forestall preventive programs because of a lack of knowledge about the youth welfare. Psychiatrists need more information about the children of their patients and about the general possibilities of prevention as well as more knowledge of supportive offers of the youth welfare. ","785":"CONCERN: The current care and financial situation of mother-child units for psychic disorders associated with pregnancies in Germany should be documented in preparation for the development of the new reimbursement system for psychiatry and psychosomatics. In accordance with the last survey of 2005, a brief questionnaire was developed and a nationwide poll was conducted. The survey revealed severe (10 fold) service deficits for severely and gravely mentally ill mothers, who require an inpatient treatment with specific professional competence. Compared with the last poll, these service deficits have increased. This is due to continued insufficient funding and unresolved financing in the new reimbursement system. With the establishment of an additional code for mother-child treatment the precondition for ensuring the funding of this important care form in the new reimbursement system was created. It is to be hoped that the decision-makers of health policy will finally face up to their social responsibility and ensure adequate funding of the additional diagnostic and therapeutic expenditure of mother-child treatment. The health care providers have an obligation to implement a transparent record of services of the additional expenditure and to augment the national evaluation approaches to inpatient mother-child treatments.

Perceived social support shows clearly lower values than in the comparative samples. The measured degree of the variable in the present sample bears negative relationship to the actual posttraumatic symptoms of the women.

BADO codings of a random sample of 200 admitted cases in 2007 were compared to information retrieved from computer-based records for the same patients. In general, the quality of data recorded using the BADO was good, particularly in terms of the accuracy and the completeness of the data. However, a comparative analysis of the data suggests that ambiguities in the coding of particular BADO items might reduce their sensitivity and precision. Data recorded using the BADO is fit for the purposes of quality management and, with some limitations, for research applications. The short version of the BADO developed using the results of the evaluation, significantly enhances its user-friendliness and increases the reliability of the coded data.

However, possible side effects to hematologic, metabolic and cardiologic systems are still entailing a defensive application in psychiatric praxis. A patient suffering from schizoaffective disorder clinically developed symptoms of cardial disturbances under the psychopharmacotherapy of Clozapine. Specific laboratory analysis and technical procedures were applied, clarifying the background of this serious event. ECG and specific myocardial enzymes (CK, Troponine-I) requesting an acute myocardial infarction were negative. Specific laboratory analysis revealed positive inflammation markers with elevated C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Additionally, there was increasing of TNF-alpha and C3 as well as an eosinophilia at differential blood cell count. Echocardiography found an unspecific dyskinesia of the left ventricle, but contrast-enhanced cardial MRI showed structural intramyocardial inhomogeneities suggesting a myocarditis.

Regression analyses were conducted to analyse associations between time series. In comparison to the federal state and the federal level the target region shows a significantly higher rate of new guardianships but a lower rate of judicial ordered mobility restrictions and at least in comparison to the federal state level a significantly lower rate of involuntary admissions according to guardianship law. The obtained differences indicate significant differences in the legal guardianship and involuntary admission practise which cannot be explained by epidemiological developments. Therefore it is necessary to investigate potential socio-cultural and socioeconomic sources for these varieties.

In Great Britain and Sweden the STAR (Scale To Assess Therapeutic Relationship) was developed for pan-theoretical assessment of therapeutic relationships from both clinicians' and patients' points of view. We translated the English version of the instrument into German and made an analysis of its feasibility and reliability. The German translation (STAR-D) was generated in a consensus procedure. The STAR-D was then administered to 100 patients admitted to the Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich (STAR-P) and their clinicians in charge (STAR-C). The psychometric qualities of feasibility and reliability were assessed. The overall results for the scales in terms of feasibility and reliability were satisfactory. We did, however, find shortcomings concerning the subscales. They could not be extracted in the principal component analysis and showed high inter-correlation coefficients.

We aimed at having a closer look at this finding by using a longer investigation period (2000-2008). Suicide rates of Weiden were contrasted with suicide rates of Bavaria and Germany. Data were obtained from the Bavarian State Office for Statistics and Data Processing and the German Federal Statistical Office. The finding named above was based on the influence of a data outlier (2006) in the number of annual suicides which is clearly evened out by examining the longer investigation period from 2000-2008. The suicide rate of Weiden is indeed higher than suicide rate of Germany and slightly higher than suicide rate of Bavaria, but not to such a drastic degree as had been stated.

Further, the influence of these constructs on patient satisfaction was investigated. 276 patients were included in a cross-sectional survey at the end of their inpatient stay. Patients showed a strong need for participation in this sample. Socio-demographic and disease-related parameters had no or only weak associations to the shared decision making variables. Strong correlations to patient satisfaction were found for doctor facilitation of patient involvement (r = 0.57) and transfer of treatment relevant information (r = 0.52).

Outpatient treatment for depression was associated with an elevated relative risk for permanent disability, but inpatient treatment even more so. Life table analysis suggests higher risks of early retirement for males who get ill early in life.

We compared the 2007 prescription rates for Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine and Memantine in defined daily doses per capita in the population aged 65 and older insured in the German Statutory Health Insurance. The prescription data for the States of Berlin and Hamburg were compared with those in the adjacent rural-type States of Brandenburg and Lower Saxony. We found a greater proportion of both general practitioners and neuropsychiatrists prescribing dementia drugs and a higher population coverage with dementia drugs in the rural states compared to the urban states. The data suggest that the drug coverage in case of dementia is better in rural than in urban states in spite of a lower physician density. This unexpected result can be explained by the fact that a smaller proportion of physicians participate in the prescription of dementia drugs in urban areas, a phenomenon probably related to differences in task description and clientele selection between physicians in urban and rural areas.

For the first time German local newspapers were examined with respect to HOW and HOW OFTEN they use psychiatric terminology. All newspapers of the East German Altmark were analyzed with respect to their usage of selected psychiatric terms for a period of one year. None of these newspapers could be described as tabloids or as predominantly sensation-seeking. For comparative purposes, our chosen methodology was similar to that of an earlier study of respected, German, internationally-read print media. In 14 % of the newspapers studied, at least one term of the predefined psychiatric vocabulary appeared. A negative context was common (45 %), but for the most part this was in crime-related articles supplied by press agencies. In contrast with reputable, German language newspapers with a nationwide or international audience, in purely local reports, a negative context was rare, and no alienating usage of preselected psychiatric terms was found. Local editorial teams seem to be closer to - and perhaps better informed about - regional psychiatric institutions. Hence, they can provide the public with more factual information. For this reason, anti-stigma mental health campaigns will likely be more effective when carried out using local media, as opposed to nationwide or even international media.

In addition to a descriptive statistical analysis a subgroup classification of fatherhood-variables associated with other independent variables, i. e. primary diagnosis, severity of disease, migration background, relationship status and age was performed using the multivariate statistical methods of Exhaustive CHAID-analysis. In total, of the 222 Patients we recruited for this study 74 (33,3 %) were fathers. Of these, 44 were fathers to an underage child. 31 of these men actually lived in the same household as their child. The Exhaustive CHAID analysis was able to display different associations between the independent variables and the varied dependent aspects of fatherhood. Here, the independent variables \"relationship status\", \"primary diagnosis\" and \"migration background\" showed to be important. A paternity rate of approximately one third demonstrates the relevance of this subject matter.

There is limited evidence on the needs of fathers with severe mental illness but they may have a greater number of needs than women, and a greater need for training in parenting skills than women suffering from severe mental illness. Parents with severe mental illness may experience stigma and discrimination, and fear accessing services due to fears of losing custody of their child.

Therapists reported on treatment outcome. A cluster analysis was conducted. Like in former research, 3 considerably differing subgroups of patients could be identified. A \"multi-problem\" subgroup with early onset of severe behavior problems has a very small chance to profit from treatment.

CCBT provides an effective and potentially cost-effective interventional strategy for depressive disorders. Effects of no and minimal contact therapies are confounded with conditions of control groups and need further investigation. While patients with Major Depression seem to benefit from computer-based therapy with regular therapist contact, it remains unclear whether unattended self-help interventions over the internet are effective for this patient population.

The SuSi-questionnaire is a reliable, valid and complex instrument with six consistent factors on three time levels. 91 % of patients related their psychosis to life events, 52 % reported a positive experience of symptoms and 70 % ascribed positive consequences to their psychosis. Patients relating psychotic experiences to life events assessed their symptoms and prospects more positively. This fact highlights the great significance of subjective meaning attribution. The SuSi-questionnaire features good psychometric qualities and offers an empirical acquisition to subjective assessment of psychosis. Results support a more biographical and in-depth psychological orientation of psychotherapy of psychosis. ","942":"The study aimed to investigate the expectations of patients in a general psychiatric hospital regarding an \"ideal\" doctor. 60 problem centred interviews with psychiatric in-patients were analysed by using a summarizing content analysis. Analysis of interview data showed three fundamental areas, which are important for patients: doctors' personality, physician-patient-interaction and treatment as well as doctors' treatment environment. The \"ideal\" doctor 1. is reachable and takes his time (75%), 2. is friendly and congenial (63%), 3. shows commitment and interest (60%), 4. is an understanding and sensitive contact person (60%), 5. is responsive to needs of patients (55%). For that reason, optimal time management and social competence is necessary and should be a part of medical students' and doctors' education. Focusing on patients' expectations can positively influence their treatment satisfaction. ","943":"To analyze whether specialization of psychiatric hospitals results in quality improvement, and whether it can and should be measured and communicated to patients and ambulatory care physicians. Depth interviews with key deciders in the German psychiatric care system. There are several specializations within the system of psychiatric hospital care which can be communicated to patients and physicians; this would facilitate choice of hospital. There is no national database available yet. Data collection and communication as provided by an independent organization would improve knowledge about hospital specialization. ","944":"A simple, systematic and targeted manualised intervention was developed and applied in the German multicentre randomised controlled trial \"Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Needs-Oriented Discharge Planning and Monitoring for High Utilisers of Psychiatric Services\" (NODPAM). Rational of the intervention is outlined. Similarities and differences in comparison with other approaches (Care Programme Approach, \"Integrierter Behandlungs- und Rehabilitations plan\", Critical Time Intervention) are delineated. The intervention consists of two sessions led by an intervention worker with patient, keyworkers (at inpatient and outpatient services), and - optionally - carer(s) participating. During each intervention session needs identified by the patient are discussed, a treatment plan is developed and subsequently circulated to all participants. Strengths (high structure, simplicity, compatibility with routine care) and disadvantages (e. g. shortness, insufficient dispersion of time, lack of integration with clinical process) of the intervention are discussed.

A migration-sensitive reanalysis of the supplement survey \"mental disorders\" of the German Health Survey 1998\/1999 was conducted. 143 migrants were compared with 3740 Germans. Results demonstrate significantly higher 4-week, 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of mental disorders for migrants in comparison to Germans. These differences are highest regarding affective disorders (4-week prevalence: 11.7 vs. 5.8 %; 12-month prevalence: 17.9 vs. 11.3 %; lifetime prevalence: 24.9 vs. 18.2 %) and somatoform disorders (4-week prevalence: 15.5 vs. 6.9 %; 12-month prevalence: 19.9 vs. 10.3 %; lifetime prevalence: 24.1 vs. 15.4 %). The results highlight the importance of a differentiating examination of prevalence rates for migrants. They also serve as a basis for further investigation of the relation between migration and mental health as well as for developing a cultural sensitive health care. ","951":"The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of racial discrimination on subjective health in migrants. The sample included 1.844 migrants from the SOEP. Discrimination was assessed by two items. Socioeconomic status, country of origin, and health behavior were included in multivariate regression models to control for effects on health. Differential models with regard to gender and origin were analysed. Migrants who experienced discrimination report a worse health status. Discrimination determines mental and physical health of migrants. There are differences in models due to gender and origin. In addition to socioeconomic factors experienced discrimination should be taken into account as a psycho-social stressor of migrants. ","952":"The desire for children among women with mental disorders may be influenced by the perception of reproductive risks for the person herself as well as for the potential child. There is a lack of research regarding the desire for children among this group. 15 narrative-biographical interviews with women with mental illness aged 26-42 years. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using a reconstructive approach. Desire for children is considered problematic by the women interviewed. Taking psychotropic drugs during pregnancy and limitations in parenting capabilities are described as dilemmata. Transmission of the mental disorder to the potential child and the limitations of planning motherhood are reported as further problems. However, individual experiences with mental disorder are also considered a parenting resource. Three different forms of coping were extracted: exclusion of motherhood, postponing motherhood, and neglecting reproductive risks.

A systematic literature search of medical and psychological journals was conducted using PubMed. Relevant publications from the reference lists and recent books were also identified and included. The article reviews the phenomenology, diagnosis, etiology, neurobiology, prevalence, conceptualization, and treatment of compulsive hoarding. Compulsive hoarding is characterized by excessive acquisition, difficulty discarding possessions, clutter that precludes activities for which living spaces where designed and it causes significant distress, family and socioeconomic burden. Neuropsychological studies and neuroimaging indicate dysfunction of the anterior cingulated cortex and other ventral and medial prefrontal cortical areas. Further research is required to resolve the controversy as to whether compulsive hoarding is characteristic of a subtype of OCD or an unique syndrome and to develop disorder specific treatments. ","956":"The enzyme system cytochrome P450 plays a central role in the metabolism of drugs in the human body. The enzyme CYP2D6 is important for the metabolism of psychoactive agents. Genetic changes in the CYP2D6 gene can lead to reduced or absent activity. We report on a 37-year-old female patient who was given risperidone to treat an acute delusional disorder. Despite receiving a very low dose, the patient suffered from an intoxication. We inferred that an excessively raised plasma level of risperidone may result from a pharmacologically relevant disorder of metabolism. The molecular genetic investigation revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in the CYP2D6 gene and thus documented a genetic predisposition as a \"poor [non]metabolizer\". In intoxications with psychoactive agents, the presence of an enzyme defect in the P450 system should be considered as an additional possible cause. ","957":"Neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia like agitation, depression and apathy often result in increased prescriptions of psychotropics. In Germany, outpatient clinics at psychiatric hospitals play an important role in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing homes. The aim of this study was to test whether the severity and pharmacotherapy differed in patients treated by outpatient clinics at psychiatric hospitals, as compared to primary care specialists. A cross-sectional study of the prevalence of agitation, apathy, and depression, and the amount of psychotropics prescribed in defined daily dosages (DDD) in 304 residents with dementia in 18 Berlin nursing homes. Patients treated by outpatient clinics at psychiatric hospitals suffered from more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (p &lt; 0.05), were prescribed more antidepressants and antidementia agents (p &lt; 0.05) and, when adjusting for the severity of agitation, less neuroleptics (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to primary care specialists. Psychiatric outpatient clinics at hospitals treat more severely demented patients who suffer from severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. The pharmacotherapy provided by these clinics displays a favourable profile according to established treatment guidelines.

Two days after leaving, he falls from a balcony on the fifth floor of a residential building and injures himself severely (paraplegia). The court case concerning damages and responsibility for paying the costs of the medical treatment eventually reaches the Kammergericht, the highest court of the state of Berlin. The main question in each trial was whether the hospital had violated its duty and was responsible for the accident and the resulting severe injuries. Relying on the hospital's documentation, the courts noted that closing the door of a ward is actually only one of the various possibilities of preventing absconding. The Kammergericht accepted the arguments of the hospital that prevention of absconding can also be achieved by intensive personal care and that security measures should not disturb the therapeutic alliance with the patient.","960":"Behavioural and psychological symptoms of Dementia include agitation, depression and apathy. Apathy is a common condition and a major challenge especially in nursing home residents. The development of a brief intervention for nursing home residents combining physical activation and reminiscence therapy in order to reactivating apathic residents and increasing their quality of life will be described.","961":"Evaluation of the predictive power of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for survival analyses of dementia patients. In an 8-year follow-up study for 145 dementia outpatients the survival and relative death risks (hazard ratios) were calculated with Kaplan Meier and Cox-regression analyses. Following Cox-regression the relative death risk increases by 36.2 % per severity level of dementia (mild \/ moderate \/ severe), p = 0.023. Per single MMSE point lost, the relative death risk rises by 4.1 % (p = 0.005). Kaplan Meier analysis supports the result. MMSE scores may in fact be used for dementia survival prognoses in counseling family and professional caregivers of dementia patients, but also for socioeconomic management of the increasing dementia burden for society. ","962":"The issue of whether depression increases or decreases with age remains unclear. Methodical aspects play an important role in the research on depression in the elderly. In a representative survey of the German general population aged 50 years and older (n = 1.156) depressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D and the PHQ-2, generalized anxiety (GA) was assessed using the GAD-7. According the CES-D 15.9 % and according to the PHQ-2 9.6 % of the population under study are classified as depressed. Prevalence rates increase with increasing age, but only few age groups show significant differences. The CES-D reveals higher prevalence rates than the PHQ-2. Nevertheless depending on the age group 3.6-7.8 % of the sample exclusively identified by the PHQ-2, and 9.0-14.9 % of the sample are exclusively identified by the CES-D. 4.8 (50-59 yrs.) to 10.3 % (80+ yrs.) report a moderate symptomatology of GA. GA is highly comorbid with depressive symptomatology. The prevalence rates in our study are consistent with previous findings of other studies. Moreover our study underpins the importance of methodical aspects for the prevalence rates identified.

Additionally, he developed concomitant psychotic episodes requiring subsequent in-patient psychiatric treatment. Following combined neurological and psychiatric treatment he always recovered from the episodes within a few weeks time. Prophylactic treatment of migraine using topiramate and acetazolamide (off-label) prevented attacks for several months. When off-label compensation was refused and, as a consequence, the drug discontinued, hemiplegia relapsed within a few days. Hence, acetazolamide was prescribed again and the family paid for the medication. Since that time, the patient did not show severe attacks for at least 8 months apart from a transient attack induced by acute flu-like illness.","966":"To identify prognostic factors for a positive or negative termination of heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) in Switzerland. A complete census of all 3155 patients ever admitted was analysed using the proportional hazard model (including time dependent covariates). Median length of stay was 11.4 years; the maximal length of stay was 13.9 years. 299 positive and 463 negative terminations were registered. Terminations clustered in the first year. Both time to positive and negative termination was significantly dependent on historical treatment cohorts since 1994. Positive termination was negatively associated with treatment in larger treatment centres (OR: 0.77, CI: 0.61-0.97) and positively with income from the social system (OR: 1.33; CI: 1.03-1.72). Negative terminations were positively associated with HIV infection before treatment (OR: 1.74; CI: 1.40-2.16), delinquence (OR 1.36; CI: 1.09-1.69), and higher levels of distrust (OR: 1.18 per scoring point; CI = 1.05-1.31). Length of stay in Swiss HAT is considerable. The proportion of positive terminations did not increase with longer stays, indicating that the majority of patients are in chronic palliative care. Negative terminations outweighed positive terminations, with a low predictive power from co-variates. The routine assessment and analysis of different covariates, such as indicators of treatment process, has the potential to improve the therapeutic outcomes of HAT. ","967":"During the deinstitutionalisation of psychiatric care in Germany, new psychiatric care approaches have been developed, which have been rarely scientifically evaluated. This study aims at evaluating the residential care and supported housing program of a public service in Westphalia, Northwestern Germany. Data on 1486 clients about sociodemographics, individual biographies, housing, social integration and perspective of care were collected by staff. Individual interviews on the clients' quality of life were conducted with 941 subjects. The residential care and supported housing program clients are chronically mentally ill and disabled. Clients from the supported housing sector have a much more favorable biographical and social background compared to those from residential care. Integration into the regular workforce does usually not happen. Clients from the residential care sector have only few social contacts outside their institution. The quality of life assessment revealed no differences between the settings. More external social contacts should be provided especially for the residential care clients. Motivational interventions might enhance the clients' social inclusion further. ","968":"The paper reports an historical analysis of the debate on trauma and psychosis in German psychiatry. Content analysis of five leading German psychiatric journals between 1889 and 2005. A substantial number of publications until the late 1960s addressed different aspects of potential links between trauma and subsequent psychosis. Papers exclusively focused on traumatic experience in adulthood. Most papers showed a negative attitude towards the idea of traumatic experiences causing psychosis. The debate on psychological trauma and psychosis refers to a long tradition in German psychiatry. Whilst the discussion contributed significantly to concepts and classifications of psychotic illnesses, it did not generate a coherent model for the potential association of trauma and subsequent psychotic disorder. ","969":"Although among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions, alcoholism seems to be neglected within the current debate on mental illness stigma. We establish the state of current research on public attitudes towards alcohol dependent people. In an extensive search of the literature, we identified 49 population studies on this topic between 1948 and 2008. 27 studies contained relevant information from Western countries and were included in this review. Although most people regard alcoholism as an illness, there is a strong tendency to blame those affected for their condition. Psycho-social causal attributions prevail over biologic explanations. Most people regard alcohol dependent persons as unpredictable and dangerous. The desire for social distance is stronger towards alcohol dependent persons than towards those with other psychiatric diagnoses such as depression or schizophrenia; only those addicted to illegal drugs suffer stronger rejection. Preferences of the public for resource allocation within the health care system put alcohol dependent patients at a potential disadvantage. Alcoholism is a severely stigmatized condition. In order to change the stigma of alcoholism, studies exploring theoretical models and mechanisms of stigmatization seem necessary. ","970":"To analyze the impact of a capitated multi-sector-financing model for psychiatric care (RPB) on costs and effectiveness of care. Patients with a diagnosis according to ICD-10 F10, F2 or F3 were interviewed in the model region (MR, n = 258) and a control region (CR, n = 244) financed according to the fee-for-service principle. At baseline, 1.5 years and 3.5 years follow-up patients were interviewed using measures of psychopathology (CGI-S, HoNOS, SCL-90R, PANSS, BRMAS \/ BRMES), functioning (GAF, SOFAS) and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF, EQ-5D). Use of care was determined semi-annually. There were no significant differences in the development of psychopathology and quality of life between MR and CR. In the MR, functioning of patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders improved significantly more strongly. The development of total mental health care costs was not different between MR and CR. However, the costs of office based mental health care increased slightly more strongly in the MR, indicating a small cost-shift from the RPB to extrabudgetary financed services. The RPB showed slight advantages regarding the effectiveness of care and did not significantly change the total mental health care costs.

Review of the literature concerning attitudes of psychiatrists towards schizophrenia and concerning the importance of hope for the course of the illness. Proposal of some approaches which might help to attain a more optimistic concept of schizophrenia and a better understanding of the patients' problems by the public. Psychiatrists often hold as negative an attitude towards schizophrenic patients as the general population. Hope or resignation can influence the course of the disease. The course of schizophrenia is more often favorable than assumed, with a quarter to almost half of patients recovering in the long run. Ideas fostering acceptance and understanding are the concept of schizophrenia as a spectrum disorder and schizophrenia as a disorder of information processing. Finally schizophrenia is a highly treatable illness with many options for treatment not fully used until now. Especially psychiatrist should strive for a positive concept of schizophrenia.

Analysis of assessment instruments mentioned in publications of two German-language journals. Most studies concerning social psychiatry used assessment instruments developed previously and for the majority data about their validity and reliability are available. The fact that most of the instruments were originally published in English indicates that they are internationally used.

In order to detect development and change in respect to the aspects mentioned, two time periods are compared systematically (1997-1998\/2007-2008). The authors selected all original papers in 16 journals from German-speaking countries along common definitions of social psychiatry. These definitions are made transparent in the study. The systematic comparison of the named time periods resulted in equal numbers of papers contributed. The major part of the publications under study has been contributed by authors associated with universities. Content-wise, articles on matters discussed in the recent past and including topics like migration, subjectivity, parent-child care are increasing. Research on social psychiatry in German-speaking countries today is mainly related to research departments at university clinics. The impact of large centres of psychiatry however is declining. Content-wise, matters at stake during the reform period of psychiatry in German-speaking countries in the 1970 s and 1980 s are of less relevance today. Researches now tend to address research topics more closely related to what can be named patient-centred care.

Subjective experiences of psychiatric admissions were recorded with a semi-structured interview in 72 fairly representative in-patients. Patients' satisfaction with treatment was recorded with the ZUF-8 questionnaire. Additionally, 52 in-patients on nine wards were interviewed in focus groups. From the patients' point of view, the most important aspects of the admission were staff, ward atmosphere and fellow patients. Violence and coercion played only a minor role. In the face-to-face interviews, assessments were generally positive, while in focus groups negative experiences and criticism were also reported. Future surveys should be conducted anonymously to minimize social desirability bias. Focus groups yield an important extension of individual interviews. ","983":"The aim of this study was to identify predictors of non-response in inpatient depression treatment by means of routinely collected data from 10 psychiatric clinics. Evaluation was carried out through univariate analyses first; subsequently a model was developed by means of multivariate analyses. About one third (31.5 %) of the 511 patients included in the study was classified as non-responder. Concerning patient level, psychic comorbidity, severity of depression symptoms and serious impairment of lifestyle as indication for hospitalisation have an impact on treatment outcome. In contrast, socio-demographic characteristics are not suitable as predictors. On the level of process characteristics, psychotherapy and patient compliance to medication enhanced the chance of profiting from inpatient treatment. The results can be integrated into a well interpretable model of the current inpatient depression treatment. Non-response is not yet sufficiently predictable through routine data. ","984":"This psychological autopsy study investigates suicide risk factors of schizophrenic and depressive inpatients. 67 potential risk factors of inpatient suicide were identified by means of literature research and caregiver interviews of schizophrenic and depressive suicidents (1995-2004). The medical records of the suicidents (n = 20) were analysed in respect to the identified risk factors and compared to their respective control group of non-suicidents (n = 20) which was matched by diagnosis, gender, age, year \/ month of admission and ward. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. In comparison to their respective control group schizophrenic (n = 11) and depressive suicidents (n = 9) differed clearly by their risk profile. Suffering from side effects of medication was found to be a predictor of suicide for schizophrenic inpatients. Psychological autopsy studies are indispensable for the construction of diagnosis-specific risk profiles. Reduction of side effects of medication seems to play a larger role in suicide prevention for schizophrenic inpatients than previously assumed. ","985":"To elucidate the connections between individual aspects and patients' concerns and the care effort provided in a clinic for the sickest among outpatients. Clients of one health insurer were followed for six months (n = 339) in a \"Institutsambulanz\" or \"PIA\". All treatment activities, which involved roughly 100,000 working minutes, were recorded. Sociodemographic data, the diagnoses, the individual needs and idiosyncracies, symptoms and case history were noted for multivariate analysis. The linear regression model with the best fit (n = 251, r (2) = 0.512, p &lt; 0.001) included six variables. Lower efforts: living in nursing home (beta = - 0.319; p &lt; 0.001), higher age (beta = - 0.238; p &lt; 0.001), legal incapacity (beta = - 0.165, p = 0.006), own work income (beta = - 0.100; p = 0.044); higher efforts: inpatient stays prior to study treatment (lifetime: beta = 0.181; p = 0.001; number of days in last two years: beta = 0.193; p &lt; 0.001). Treatment aims, functional deficits, and diagnoses did not have a significant influence. Younger patients who wish for an independent life despite of a grave psychiatric disorder may effectuate higher treatment efforts. Treatments administered to nursing-home inhabitants are far less complex, although these patients are even sicker. The current reimbursement mechanism may serve as a disincentive towards care administration according to individual need.

In 2000 the Ministry of Social Affairs of the State of Bavaria, Germany, implemented a model for forensic outpatient treatment. Three forensic hospitals established forensic outpatient clinics. The Department of Forensic Psychiatry of the Psychiatric Hospital of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich evaluated the treatment and management programs with financial support from the Ministry. 111 mentally ill offenders were included after release from forensic hospitals. 65 % suffered from schizophrenia. In 4.5 years time of observation a recidivism rate of 0.9 % of severe offences could be found (3.6 % including cases of suspicion). 17 % of the patients needed a rehospitalisation and 12 % a legal intervention. At the end of the observation period 42 patients still needed treatment, but 44 patients continued therapy in the forensic outpatient setting out of own interests.

Therefore, information was collected on how relatives assess the patients' insight into illness and their current treatment situation. This assessment was compared with the relatives' feelings of well-being. Questionnaire-assisted exploration of 84 relatives, who participated in an information session about lack of insight into illness. 73 % of patients had a lack of insight into illness according to their relatives. Of these, 79 % were male, the mean duration of inpatient treatment was 12 months, 56 % used an antipsychotic medication and 80 % were \"quite\/very ill\".

While this changed with the advent of qualitative research into stigma, population-based data on the prevalence, severity and consequences of stigma experiences are lacking. The present study aims at field-testing the German version of the Inventory of Stigmatizing Experiences (ISE) , developed to investigate the epidemiology of \"felt stigma\". The ISE is a semi-structured questionnaire composed of two scales: one measuring the scope of stigma experienced in different life domains (SES; 9 items), the other assessing their psychosocial impact (SIS; 7 items). The instrument was translated into German, using the three-step procedure proposed by WHO (translation, back-translation, feasibility testing). Field-testing of the German version was carried out on 95 service users. The German version of the ISE shows good reliabilities for both the stigma experiences (SES; alpha = 0.74) and stigma impact (SIS; alpha = 0.86) scales. 54.4 % of service users report stigma experiences across the SES; 72 % of these are recent and thus susceptible for interventions. The German version of the ISE is a compact and reliable tool for measuring the prevalence and impact of felt stigma, with potential uses in both population-based stigma research and clinical practice. ","992":"The present study was designed to to investigate lifetime prevalence and types of stalking victimization in a sample of psychiatric in-patients. 300 consecutively admitted patients of the psychiatric clinic of the Central Institute of Mental Health were included and examined with a standardized stalking victimisation questionnaire. The cohort of psychiatric in-patients had a lifetime prevalence of being a stalking victim of 21.3 % . The percentage of men and women affected was equal. The course of stalking was more difficult to handle and more violent compared to a representative cohort of the general population of Mannheim. In most cases, the psychiatric disorder had been present before the stalking victimization started. The attending psychiatrists were only aware of the stalking victimization in four cases. Stalking seems to be a relevant problem in psychiatric patients. The results indicate that there is urgent need for advanced educational programs for patients and psychiatrists.

The results of this study were somewhat sobering, with 22.3 % of the population not having any associations with the term \"schizophrenia\", 81.3 % not wanting to be further informed about the illness, and 64.1 % agreeing with the statement that patients suffering from schizophrenia are dangerous; compared to the survey in 1998, there was a significant increase within this category. Furthermore, an increase of social distance towards this group of patients has also been noted. It is to be asked whether a short intervention can change people's profound attitudes.

The treatment changed for the benefit of Quetiapine and Haloperidol. The use of both Risperidone and Olanzapine decreased markedly. The antipsychotic treatment changed due to critical publication. But, the evidence for the risk profile is still a matter of debate. ","995":"Insight into illness is key to successful treatment. Poor insight, especially in schizophrenia, is, however, quite a frequent phenomenon that is also associated with poor adherence to treatment and a variety of unfavorable outcome parameters. On that background, the concept of insight into illness has gained new reseach interest during the last 10 years. The present review aims to report new findings regarding conceptual changes of insight, findings on the etiology, contributing factors as well as the assessment and methods to develop insight. Based on a review of the literature, results from more recent studies on insight into illness will be presented. Insight into illness is a complex, multidimensional, strongly culturally embedded phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. The etiology of insight still remains poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial including psychological, neuropsychological and organic reasons. Further research is needed, in particularly regarding therapeutical techniques to improve insight into illness.

Using linear regressions with forward elimination, we analyzed the predictive value of the AMDP syndromes, and also of global assessment of functioning, illness severity and certain sociodemographic factors for the length of stay. Together with clinical and sociodemographic factors, we found a variance estimation of 20 %. Our pilot study does not imply AMDP syndromes to be suitable for a case grouping to estimate costs.

A 60 year-old worker exhibited an open scull fracture and 14 abdominal wounds with protrusion of small intestine, from which a part of 160 cm length was completely removed beforehand. The patient claimed the wounds having been caused accidentally. When examined by a psychiatrist, disturbances in orientation, unrest and ill concentration were found, but no symptoms related to psychosis, depression or suicidal behaviour. Although the need for more detailed examination seemed to be clearly evident, the medical authorities did not take action. Consequently, no further psychiatric treatment was initiated. The implications of this case on the background of the literature are discussed.

Contrary to expectation, no significant correlations between measures of religiosity and psychological distress were found for the Turkish migrant group. Further, inverse relationships between measures of religiosity and measures of integration resulted. Migrants who were more acculturated showed less religiosity.

Using his experience during this process, he makes some critical comments on the current methods of developing evidence-based treatment recommendations. Treatment recommendations derived from established levels of evidence were examined regarding their possible bias. The following sources of bias were identified: 1. The levels of evidence are related to the quality of studies, not to reported effect sizes; 2. external validity of studies are not taken into account systematically; 3. absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; 4. the ethical framework of many clinically relevant objectives cannot be represented adequately in randomized controlled trials; 5. achieved consensus between professionals, users, and relatives may be highly important and receives inadequately low levels of recommendation due to the definition of evidence.

Retrospective evaluation of all sexual offenders (n = 79) who were treated in the forensic psychiatric hospital Berlin between the 1.1.1998 and the 1.1.2005. There is an increase in the number of patients treated with antiandrogenic medication during the observed time period.

Cost data were inflated to the year 2007. We finally included 11 studies in our review which show that schizophrenia causes societal cost of several billion Euros per year. After adjustment for inflation, costs per patient and year estimated between 1980 and 2002 tended to be relatively stable at around 14,000 to 18,000 Euro. Additionally, relatives are confronted with spending of 950 to 1,700 Euro due to the patients' disorder. Indirect costs are mainly due to early retirement or unemployment and amount to 25,000 to 30,000 Euro per patient when using the human capital approach. We found that changes in treatment settings and increasing costs of drug treatment seem to be reflected in published cost-of-illness studies. When corrected for inflation, treatment cost per patient for schizophrenia show changes in their distribution over different cost sectors in the health care system but no substantial increases between 1980 and 2002.

On the other hand general practitioners do rate some of their patients as depressive despite the fact that psychiatric diagnostic instruments do not. In this study we wanted to not only analyse the number and proportion of concordant diagnoses between GP and an established psychiatric diagnostic instrument (PHQ-9), but also to analyse the modalities of non-concordant diagnostic classifications. 34 participating GPs asked all their patients visiting them at one ordinary work-day to fill in a questionnaire that included the German version of PHQ-9. Independently GPs documented their diagnostic judgement. If they saw a mental affection, they were asked to choose between eight different affections, with depression being just one of them. 1 277 patients filled in the questionnaires; from these 902 questionnaires could be analysed, because a pair of GP and patient could be identified. The prevalence of major-depression in the study-population was 9 %. GPs and PHQ-9 diagnoses were concordant in 45 %. However, GPs rated two thirds of patients that were classified as depressed by the PHQ-9 as psychologically affected. In these patients they also devoted more than half of the consultation time to mental problems. GPs do often not diagnose patients as depressive even though they clearly realise their mental affection. Simple explanations like lack of time or conscious or unconscious avoidance to make a psychiatric diagnosis cannot explain this phenomenon.

Selective literature research on classification, occurrence, effects and therapy. Frequency and subjective distress of sexual problems in patients with schizophrenia are widely underestimated. Pharmacogenic and morbogenic causes of the sexual problems are often difficult to differentiate. The low awareness of health care professionals for sexual problems and their persistence have significant negative impact on patients' satisfaction with the treatment, compliance, quality of life and partnership.

A total of 5,356 elderly psychiatric inpatients (&gt; 65 years) with 7,658 episodes of inpatient care in a psychiatric university hospital between 1996 and 2006 was included in the study. Besides descriptive analyses, univariate analyses and binary logistic regression analyses were performed. Four inpatient suicides and 14 attempted suicides of twelve inpatients were recorded during the 11-year period. Three of the 4 inpatient suicides and 6 of the 12 inpatients attempting suicide during hospital stay had a diagnosis of depression. Furthermore, 280 suicides before admission were attempted by 262 patients. Regression analysis revealed life time suicide attempt, ICD-10 diagnosis F43, period of onset of present episode less than one week and ICD-10 diagnosis F32 \/ F33 as significant predictors of attempted suicide before admission. Suicidal thoughts without concomitant suicide attempt before admission were recorded for 389 admissions of 346 patients. According to regression analysis, risk of suicidal thoughts before admission is increased for patients with life time suicide attempt, ICD-10 diagnosis F43, ICD-10 diagnosis F32 \/ F33, ICD-10 diagnosis F30 \/ F31, greater number of hospital admissions, short cumulative length of stay and non-chronic course of disease. Examination of risk faktors of suicidal behaviour within the framework of hospital admissions should not be restricted exclusively to period of hospital stay. Relevant risk factors can be found even before hospital stay and could be a cue for suicide prevention already in the forefront of admission.

There is evidence for beneficial effects of a training of power and balance on the frequency of falls in residential homes. An adapted training of power and balance was developed by specialists of training in sports. In 2007, 159 patients with dementia were trained. The frequency and duration of mechanical restraint was compared with a control group of a different hospital (n = 217) and the patients treated in the year before (n = 164). The percentage of patients with mechanical restraint and the mean duration of restraint per admission were significantly lower than in the control group. However, only a non-significant reduction could be achieved in comparison with the patients treated in the year before without an increase of falls. A considerable reduction of the use of mechanical restraint in patients with dementia is feasible. An unequivocal association with the training could not be confirmed due to other influencing factors.

This procedures where adequately evaluated and are regarded to be completed in the western world today. However, few evidence has been presented regarding the further course of integration following discharge from mental hospitals: was integration into community really successful or were patients permanently placed in sheltered housing staffed 24 hours 7 days a week. This review focuses on the question whether papers describing large de-institutionalisation projects mention the level of institutional support in the years following discharge from hospital. Furthermore we tried to find out which parameters are dealt with when describing successful community integration. \"Pubmed\" was searched for studies on de-institutionalisation projects published between 1997 and 2007. The discharge from the mental hospital wards was in all studies described as successful, positive effects like an increased quality of life were found. However, studies describing the years following discharge mentioned that patients continuously stayed in sheltered housing with care offered 24 hours a day. Reviewing the available data about the level of support regarding accommodation of former long time patients, the danger of \"trans-institutionalisation\" has to be pointed out. Evidence is lacking concerning support models tailored to the individual needs of the patients. Similarly, possible side effects of long-term stays in sheltered housing staffed 24 hours a day have not yet been established. Therefore, we see a need for further evaluation of different models of supported housing for former long-term hospitalised patients, as well as for new chronic mentally ill patients.

In addition, prior to discharge, cognitive performance and personality traits were measured. The sample was divided into responders and nonresponders by the reduction of depressive symptoms from admission to discharge. For the assumption of response, a reduction of minimum 50 % was defined. Preliminary results suggest an impact of personality traits onto response in depressive patients, particularly extraversion seems to have a salutary effect.

Social indicators for the 62 city neighbourhoods were analysed for their influence on suicide frequency using correlation and Poisson regression methods. Between 2002 and 2004, 217 suicides were registered in Dortmund. In women, but not in men, high correlations with several social neighbourhood indicators were found. In the regression analysis the proportions of married individuals, welfare recipients, and elderly citizens (65 years and older) as well as the population density were significantly associated with the suicide frequency in the neighbourhoods.

The combined detoxication of GHB and alcohol was successfully finished by a reduction schedule of diazepam. Withdrawal-assessment scales for alcohol were helpful, but show limitations for GHB-withdrawal symptoms.

Quantitative and qualitative data from 404 family caregivers was analysed using binary logistic regression analysis and qualitative content analysis, respectively. In addition, 11 day hospital managers were interviewed concerning their quality concepts. The only significant predictor for the utilisation of day hospitals is the estimate of how helpful this support is for the family caregiver's situation. Those who have already had experiences with a day hospital expressed a wish for medical and psychiatric care by \"well-trained\" staff and a reasonable form of occupation for the dementia patient. In order to increase utilisation, family caregivers must be convinced of the advantages of using day hospitals.

Coping with typical developmental tasks of early adulthood (e. g. autonomy; intimate relationships; vocational training) is impeded. At the same time, young patients wish as much normality as possible in their daily life, e. g. social contacts with not-affected peers. In many cases, young adults affected try to maintain a cautious distance to psychiatric facilities as well as to other patients. Young people suffering from mental illness are in a complicated process of identity formation, as they have to integrate the illness into their self-concept and their daily life (illness-identity work).

Prevalences of mental disorders are the same across cohorts but lifetime risk is higher in recent cohorts (in particular for depression). A gradient of social class shows a tendency to be stronger in younger cohorts. Due to the retrospective design increased lifetime risk in younger cohorts might be over-estimated.

The proportion of inpatient prescriptions of antidepressants and antidementia drugs is increasing, whereas neuroleptics and benzodiazepines are undergoing the reverse trend.

Previous results have shown that unawareness of deficits affects cognitive and emotional domains as well as activities of daily living, thus any diagnostic instrument should capture these different aspects. However, methodological issues such as the objectivity of caregiver reports or patients' ability to assess their own performance need to be considered in order to obtain reliable data.

The quality of life was not lowered compared to a comparison group of the same age. The sense of coherence was significantly higher than that of the comparison group. The participants belonged to a comparably unobtrusive group of veterans. A possible protective variable might be the high sense of coherence. ","1086":"Religious delusions are prevalent symptoms in schizophrenia. It is unclear, however, whether religious delusions reflect illness- or culture-related factors. Cross-cultural retrospective comparison of the prevalence of religious delusions in 132 patients treated for paranoid schizophrenia in East Berlin (former GDR) from 1980 to 1985, and 151 patients from Regensburg (FRG) who were treated as in-patients from 1980 to 1983. Prior to the German re-unification, religious delusions were significantly less frequent in East Berlin compared to Regensburg (11.6% as opposed to 28.6 %, chi2 = 8.029; p = 0.0046). The prevalence of religious delusions in schizophrenia is, above all, associated with cultural factors. Religious delusions are therefore secondary phenomena in schizophrenia, and not inherent to the illness process. ","1087":"To clarify to what extent subjectively-stated effects and side-effects differ between conventional and atypical neuroleptic agents and to what degree they depend on the method of questioning. Effects and side effects of antipsychotic medication in 136 schizophrenia patients were studied through naturalistic observation over a period of 12 months (3 measurement time points) and information sought in 2 different ways: firstly, patients gave spontaneous information on the effects\/side effects; they were then asked in detail on the basis of a checklist. Patients gave far less information spontaneously than when asked questions. There were no differences between typical and atypical antipsychotic agents in terms of effects or side effects. Patients, who could give spontaneous information on side effects, but not on positive effects of their neuroleptic agents, discontinued their medication more frequently in the further course. Information given by patients represents and important and usable source of information, but it can be influenced by the nature of questioning. A fundamental recommendation of the prescription of typical or atypical antipsychotic agents is not possible on the basis of the data. ","1088":"To provide an overview of empirical findings with regard to adjustment disorders. Literature was identified by searches in Medline and Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews. Adjustment disorder is a common diagnosis in clinical samples (5% to 24%). There is a high frequency of comorbid somatic and mental disorders, especially of personality disorders (15% to 73%). The diagnostic stability of adjustment disorders in the long-term courses seems to be low. It is unclear to what extent adjustment disorders can be differentiated from affective or anxiety disorders with regard to psychopathological symptoms and course. With respect to treatment, as yet only a small empirical database exists. A psychopathological revision of the current nosological concept of adjustment disorders should be taken into consideration. Such a revision could lead either to an extension or to a narrowing of the diagnostic group \"adjustment disorders\". ","1089":"The aim of the current study was to examine the occurrence of sense of coherence (SOC) and the relationship between SOC and anxiety, depression, somatoform complaints and life satisfaction in female bulimia nervosa (BN) outpatients. In a consecutive cross-sectional study 73 BN outpatients (age 26.9 years, SD 7.8) were assesssed with the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), and the Screening for Somatoform Disorders (SOMS-2). The BN outpatients showed highly reduced SOC in comparison to the reference group (M = 45.09 vs. M = 71.23; p &lt; or = 0.001). SOC significantly correlated inversely with depression and somatoform complaints. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between SOC and life satisfaction (r = 0.467; p &lt; or = 0.001). Interestingly, SOC was not significantly correlated with anxiety. The results support the thesis that female BN outpatients could benefit from an enhancement of SOC particularly with regard to depression and somatoform complaints. ","1090":"This paper inquires the hypothesis that Hitler's rise to power was in part due to a hypnotic therapy he had undergone when being treated for hysterical blindness at an army hospital in the town of Pasewalk in October 1918 - as recent contributions have argued. Edmund Forster, his psychiatrist at that time, is supposed to have suggested to Hitler that he would be ordained as Germany's redeemer in times of defeat, thus causing a profound change in his patient's personality. Following three lines of argument, this paper examines if such an assumption can be made plausible. Firstly, it takes a close look at the main historical source which is the novel THE EYEWITNESS, written in German language by the Czech-Jewish author Ernst Weiss. Then it asks if Forster is likely to have chosen hypnosis as a method of treatment. Finally, it exploits the work of the even lesser known author Alexander Moritz Frey who happened to serve close to Hitler as a medical orderly in WW I, thus trying to validate whether or not Hitler really underwent a change of personality in autumn 1918. Although the eventualities of such a hypnotic treatment or a profound change in Hitler's behaviour in that time cannot be disproved, both seem highly unlikely. S One should altogether abandon the notion of Hitler having suffered a permanent change of personality in 1918, be it due to psychiatric treatment or to psychological trauma itself.

In contrast, burden and needs of the bereaved are still not systematically evaluated. All relatives of inpatient suicides of depressive or schizophrenic patients in the years 1995 to 2004 (n = 20) got an invitation for an interview about the suicide, their burden and needs due to the suicide of their family member. 13 relatives could be contacted, 9 (69.2 %) bereaved family members could be interviewed. The recorded data were analysed using a summarizing content analysis. Five relatives lost their child, two their spouses and two a parent. Four out of nine relatives suffer from ongoing feelings of guilt and\/or restlessness due to the question, \"why\" the suicide happened. Eight caregivers had wished more initiative of supporting them from the professionals of the psychiatric institution, in which their ill family member was treated. Four relatives retrospectively assumed, that meeting other bereaved would have probably helped them. Professionals of the inpatient suicide treatment team should be more proactive in offering the bereaved relatives possibilities to talk to them. Furthermore, support should be offered repeatedly, not only once when the relatives pick up the belongings of their lost family member from the clinic.

The cross-sectional analysis of 129 GPs and 390 patients is part of the three-arm cluster-randomized controlled follow-up-study Project IDA - Initiative dementia care in primary practice . The study was carried out in Middle Franconia, a typical urban-rural area in Southeastern Germany. The sample constitutes the baseline assessment. GPs had to document their diagnostic and therapeutic behaviour upon inclusion of dementia patients in the study. As expected, significant differences in imaging diagnostic procedures exist between urban (57.9 %) and rural (42.7 %) areas (p = 0.010). There are no differences in the referral quote to specialists (total 57.9 %), in the frequency of treatment with non-pharmacological therapies (total 13.3 %) as well as pharmacological therapies with evidence-based medication (18.7 %; AChE inhibitors and Memantine). Except for imaging diagnostic procedures, there were no differences in the regime of urban and rural GPs. Thus, an almost similar care for rural and urban dementia patients can be assumed.

Semi-structured interviews with 20 schizophrenic patients were tape-recorded. Using the software Atlas.ti, the data were analysed according to the model of inductive category development (Mayring, 1995). Nearly all patients regarded the GPs as doctors \"for the body\" and--in contrast--the psychiatrists as doctors \"for the soul\". At the same time, an appointment with a GP was perceived as less embarrassing and stigmatising. Patients consulted their GP mainly because of somatic complaints or to receive follow-up prescriptions for their antipsychotic medication. They liked to get a \"second opinion\" regarding medical decisions by GPs. Some patients wished to have more consultation time with their GP to discuss psychological problems. Schizophrenic patients appreciate the distinction, and the choice, between different medical specialties. Primary care offers services with an exceptionally low threshold for schizophrenic patients because consultations with a GP are to a lesser degree perceived as embarrassing or stigmatising. ","1100":"A majority of the population regards unconscious conflict as a possible cause for depression or schizophrenia. We examine to what extent people associate psychoanalytical concepts with this term. Population-based telephone survey (n = 1010), open questions about the meaning and origin of the term unconscious conflict. 5 % gave a definition with clearly psychoanalytical elements, another 13 % perceived an internal conflict. 24 % thought of a conflict between persons, 23 % had no answer. Regarding the origin of the term, 4 % associated Freud or psychoanalysis, 27 % psychology. For both questions, answers closer to Freudian ideas were more common in West compared to East Germany. A concretised understanding far from Freud's original conception of unconscious conflict dominates, which is even stronger in the former communist parts of Germany. Psychoanalytical terms do not necessarily carry a psychoanalytical significance with the public. ","1101":"The number of medical liability court cases in Germany has more than trebled over the past 30 years. In almost every case of a therapeutic failure, the accusation is one of insufficient medical information. It was investigated which requirements information for patients has to meet in the field of psychiatry and psychotherapy. The supreme court jurisdiction relating to patient information and consent in medicine was analysed. Legal and medical documents on the topic were also evaluated. Doctors' legal duty to provide information includes the areas of therapeutic information, enabling information for the patient, and information relating to costs. The burden of proof is always on the doctor, and the documentation needs to be legally safe. The legal basis relating to patient information and consent is consistent with the objectives of patient oriented psychiatry and psychotherapy. However, many legal requirements are exaggerated and far removed from medical practice. The specialist societies are called on to develop guidelines on how to provide information during the medical consultation.

The question of the attending physician, whether the symptoms indicate an early beginning of schizophrenia or whether the symptoms can be considered as an overdose phenomenon of methylphenidate should be discussed. The knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate as modified--release formulation and the serum concentration values of methylphenidate and its metabolite provide information for interpretation of the case reported, with regard to the purpose of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for methylphenidate. Finally we conclude that the ingestion of an unintended overdose of methylphenidate may have caused the boy's psychotic symptoms and that routine therapeutic serum concentrations of methylphenidate have to be correlated to the point of time when the blood was drawn in relation to the intake of methylphenidate.","1103":"Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is still a severe side effect induced by old neuroleptic drugs as well as modern atypical ones. The treatment is inefficient and often experimental. Aim of this study was to examine the effect of pramipexole, a dopamine D3 receptor agonist, in a severe case of oro-facial TD. The TD of a 21 year old male patient with severe oro-facial occurrence was assessed by the Simpson et al scale before starting pramipexole therapy. Reevaluation was made during therapy and when the maximum dose of 1.44 mg a day was reached. Standard therapy with clozapine, valproic acid, oxazepam, bornaprin hydrochlorid and tiapride was continued as before. Oral dyskinesia decreased 20 % and no side effects were observed. Regarding psychopathology the patient was more interested in work and showed better concentration in therapies. Pramipexole could be a new promising add-on therapy in severe TD. Additionally, the low plasma binding and mild side effect profile of pramipexole makes it safe in combination with antipsychotic therapy.

We report on the e-mail-correspondence with a young woman (according to her own statement), taking medical advice for depressive symptoms via Internet. The correspondence focuses on the difficulties of the consulter to find and accept adequate (professional) support in the \"real world\". On the basis of this case report, advantages and limitations of the communication via Internet are discussed.

In this paper, we report on two subjects with psychotic disorders who were found to have peripheral edema during olanzapine therapy. The theoretical background and the relevance of this observation are examined. Furthermore, edema as a side effect of antipsychotic treatment is reviewed. In particular, the importance of olanzapine, a commonly used neuroleptic drug, as a possible causative substance is evaluated. ","1106":"Several studies reported that general practitioners often do not recognize depressive disorders among their patients. Routine screening is a time-consuming procedure which might be improved by means of a two-step procedure. Using a very brief screening instrument in a first step reduces the number of patients needing a longer conventional screening in a second step. Only screening positives after this second step will be examined by the general practitioner (GP). Based upon validity scores from published studies, the expected validity of such a two-step procedure is being investigated. This two-step screening procedure decreases the overall number of screening positives who have to be examined for the presence of depression by the GP. While the combined sensitivity slightly decreases, the combined specificity increases. The proposed method allows for a practicable routine screening for depression by the GP. The procedure might further be improved through the development of instruments optimized for the first and the second step. ","1107":"The aim of the study was the investigation of positive symptoms and quality of life from the subjective perspective of patients with schizophrenia. We assessed self- and expert-rated positive symptoms (semi-structured interview), standardized psychopathology (PANSS), subjective well-being (SWN) and QOL (MSLQ) in n=59 patients. Patients reported that ideas of grandiosity and hallucinations of dialogue voices were less distressing compared with command voices, malevolent voices and delusional ideas of persecution. Patients with high levels of distress reported significant lower subjective well-being (SWN: t=2.27; p&lt;0.05) and QOL (MSLQ: t=2.01; p&lt;0.05), but showed no differences in symptom severity (PANSS: t=-0,98; p=n. s.) compared with patients with low subjective distress. Distress caused by positive symptoms reflected the individual meaning of the symptoms and was associated with lower quality of life.

Prevalence and conversion rates, relative risks and data on the sensitivity and specifity of MCI for the development of dementia will be calculated. 980 subjects aged 75 years and over who participated in the Leipzig Longitudinal Study of the Aged (LEILA 75+) were clinically interviewed and cognitively tested at regularly intervals over a mean period of six years. At baseline, the prevalence of MCI was 19.3 %, including (original) and 41.5 % excluding (modified) the criterion of subjective cognitive complaints. Diagnoses of original and modified amnestic MCI-subtypes were associated with relative risks of more than three for the development of dementia. MCI represents a risk factor for dementia, mainly if the cognitive impairments are related to the area of memory. However, in order to predict dementia reliably, further findings (e. g. biomarkers) are required. ","1109":"To provide a systematic review of target-group oriented interventions aimed at reducing the stigma surrounding mental illness. An electronic literature search was carried out based on PubMed. In addition, the reference lists of included studies were examined and other sources like the internet were used. 51 studies could be identified, over half of them being targeted at school students. There was a large variation in the format of the various interventions. One half of interventions were based exclusively on education, the other half on a combination of education with contact with someone with a mental disorder. The vast majority of studies reported positive intervention effects. However, in several studies the effect did not persist over a time period of a few months. It appears easier to improve knowledge or to change misconceptions of mental disorders than to reduce the tendency to distance oneself from people with mental illness. When directly comparing the effect of interventions based exclusively on education with those combining education with facilitating contact with people with mental disorders, the latter proved more effective. A remarkable number of targeted interventions aimed at reducing the stigma attached to mental illness have been carried out. However, due to methodological limitations no definite assessment of the effect of these interventions is possible at the present time. There is a pressing need for research that adheres more closely to the methodological standards of evaluation research. ","1110":"Unemployment has a strong negative impact on quality of life and on the further course of the disease of mentally disordered individuals. Therefore, vocational rehabilitation programmes are necessary to help people with mental disorders to obtain work. There is increasing scientific evidence concerning positive predictors for vocational integration. This paper intends to give an overview about established predictors for successful integration. \"Pubmed\" was searched for studies on psychiatric vocational rehabilitation programmes published between 1997 and 2007, which had the focus on predictors of successful outcome. Some of the most important predictors are a better history of work integration and better work performance measured during psychiatric vocational rehabilitation. Successful vocational integration is harder if negative symptoms or cognitive deficits are present. The impact of sociodemographic factors, diagnosis, motivation to work and social skills is discussed controversially. Future research should be directed to design vocational rehabilitation programmes, which address the specific needs of psychiatric patients.

In a representative population sample of men and women aged 50 years and older (n = 1.185) mental disorders (depression, somatisation and panic syndrome), health care utilization and illness behaviour were assessed by means of self rating instruments. About 10 % of the study sample fulfil the criteria of at least one mental disorder. Older people with mental disorders showed a significantly increased health care utilization compared to people without mental disorders. They especially visit general practitioners but did not show an extended number of psychiatrists' or psychotherapists' visits. Mental disorders are associated with divergent illness behaviour. Regression analysis revealed that somatic complaints and depression were independent predictors of illness behaviour and health care utilization. General practitioners get a central function in the health care system for older people with mental disorders. More attention should be paid to the detection of mental disorders in older people and the special requirements of this subgroup of patients.

All patients with first admission to a psychiatric hospital between 1996 and 2002 were included in te cohort study (n=9727). The analyses were based on the psychiatric basis documentation system (DGPPN-BADO). 192 patients (2%) had the diagnosis of a mental retardation according to ICD-10. 62% of patients suffered from a mild (F70), 26% from a moderate (F71) and 9% from a severe mental retardation (F72). The most frequent comorbid disorders were disruptive behaviour disorders, adjustment disorders, alcohol-related disorders, Schizophrenia and mood disorders. Mean length of stay was 34.8 days, rate of rehospitalisation within one year was 0.3. GAF improved on 11.8, CGI (improvement scale) was 3.4. Some predictors for these outcome criteria could be revealed. The data allow a depth insight into inpatient care of patients with mental retardation. They deliver important clues for quality improvement in psychiatric hospital and for collaboration with outpatient services. ","1115":null,"1116":"A comprehensive review of the present state and new approaches of patient participation in German psychiatry was conducted. Literature search. Most psychiatric patients wish to be informed about their disease and treatment options and express a desire for participation in medical decisions. Patient representatives want to participate in political decisions concerning health care. There have been political and legal improvements in recent years, including the implementation of a federal government commissioner for patient issues and the publication of patients' rights. With regard to potential effects of programs promoting patient participation, there are almost no results available for German psychiatry. Pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility of user involvement and shared decision making in mental health and have also shown favourable outcomes. Until now there has been no general implementation of user involvement in all areas of German psychiatry. However, the desire of patients to participate in all levels of health care system will tend to increase within the next years. Thus, it seems important for physicians to develop new skills in order to meet the participation and information needs of their patients.

Although supervised disulfiram treatment has been shown to improve outcome in court-referred patients too it is obviously rarely used in German forensic hospitals. Two cases illustrated the application of disulfiram to constitute an adjunct to treatment of forensic inpatients. Disulfiram can be used as an adjunct for maintenance of abstinence when the relapse risk is due to insufficient impulse control. The decision to use disulfiram to assure sobriety for high risk groups, e.g. criminal offenders is discussed. ","1122":"In clinical practise, discharge letters addressed to caregivers are rare. We report on a discharge letter, addressed to the family of a 46-year-old patient suffering from a disorganized type of schizophrenia with continuous course. The case report indicates that letters to caregivers are useful to provide psychoeducation, to disburden caregivers and to enhance treatment continuation, prevention of relapse and rehabilitation of the patient. Furthermore, discharge letters to caregivers appreciate the role of relatives as important partners in patients' successful treatment. Letters to caregivers are an efficient chance to increase confidence and satisfaction of caregivers of psychiatric patients.

We report a male patient with pre-existing epilepsy who developed acute psychosis with delusions and acoustic hallucinations, two days after a prolonged complex-partial seizure. Upon treatment with diazepam and haloperidol, the psychosis subsided within three days. The optimation of antiepileptic drugs is the main point to prevent seizures and postictal psychotic episodes in epilepsy. This case shows that close collaboration between neurologists and psychiatrists on epilepsy associated psychoses is decisive for an optimal success of therapy. ","1124":"Little is known about the effectiveness and the cost of care for patients treated in vocational rehabilitation programs,although vocational therapy is an essential part of inpatient treatment and community care of patients with schizophrenia. As a part of a randomised controlled trial in 5 centres, the long-term direct cost of care for patients with schizophrenia,being treated with different vocational rehabilitation programs during an index-stay in a psychiatric hospital were assessed. results were compared to controls who received non-specific ergo-therapeutic treatment instead. Cost differences between study patients and controls were small and not statistically significant. However, cross-centre costs differed considerably. In spite of standardized inclusion criteria and a randomised assignment of study patients, a selection bias, triggered by the differing vocational rehabilitation programs is assumed as a source of cross-centre cost-variation which might be supported by differing service offers in the study regions. ","1125":"Spouses of patients with depression have an elevated risk to develop an affective disorder themselves. We evaluate whether a group intervention program for spouses of patients with depression does improve participants' depressive and anxiety symptoms. 66 spouses participated in a six months intervention with 12 group sessions. 50 nonparticipants were included as a control group. We measured depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) at the beginning and the end as well as 3 and 9 months after the intervention. The intervention did not cause any improvement with regard to BDI and BAI scores. Scores in the BDI and BAI were normal in most participants before the intervention. Regardless, satisfaction with the program among participants was very high. The influence of the intervention concept on the wanting participation of more severely affected spouses is discussed and adaptations of the program are proposed.

Since there is no standardized definition of this symptom complex, the aim of this study is to access excessive computer gaming in German adolescents as an addictive disorder and its potential negative consequences. Psychopathological computer gaming behavior was diagnosed by applying the adapted diagnostic criteria of substance-related-addictions as defined by the ICD-10. At the same time demographic variables, state of clinical anxiety and underlying cognitive mechanisms were analyzed. 6.3 % of the 221 participating pupils - mostly boys with a low educational background - fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of a behavioral addiction. Clinically diagnosed adolescents exhibited limited cognitive flexibility and were identified to utilize computer gaming as a mood management strategy. These results can be interpreted as a first hint for a prevalence estimation of psychopathological computer gaming in German adolescents. ","1130":"Among the public schizophrenia is often thought to denote split personality. Our aim is to identify factors influencing the prevalence of this error. METHODS In a representative population survey in Germany (n=5,025), respondents received an open question about their associations with the word schizophrenia and a closed question how strongly they agree that split personality is a symptom of the disease. 27% associated split personality with schizophrenia, 67.4% agreed this being a symptom. Higher education was associated with answering\/endorsing split personality in both questions. Familiarity with mental illness and living in the old German Laender increased unprompted mention of the concept. Mistaking schizophrenia for split personality is an error of the well-educated that is not favourably altered by familiarity with mental illness. Targeting this misconception seems to be difficult and could necessitate a new illness denomination.

The patient's medical records as well as the progress of the in-patient tramadol detoxification by means of oxcarbazepine are outlined. Additionally, we discuss our experience with oxcarbazepine as a therapeutic alternative in addiction medicine. Also in tramadol withdrawal the good tolerability as well as mood stabilising effects during and after inpatient treatment was shown. The inpatient time for withdrawal was significantly shortened, in contrast to the past no withdrawal symptoms emerged and after inpatient treatment the patient showed up abstinent and was affective good stabilised. ","1132":"Lithium is known to be neurotoxic at higher serum levels. In rare cases patients develop symptoms of intoxication or full blown intoxications even when lithium levels are normal. Our aim was to detect predicting factors of lithium neurotoxicity at normal serum lithium levels in order to allow prevention of those constellations. We report two cases of severe lithium intoxications at normal serum lithium levels and review the current literature concerning lithium neurotoxicity at normal serum levels. It appears that the probability of developing signs of lithium intoxications in patients treated with lithium is increased with advanced age, co-morbidity with pre-existing neurological or other general diseases, especially those associated with fever, and in combination with the use of antipsychotics, antidepressants or mood stabilizers. The serum lithium level does not necessarily detect an intoxication. In patients developing signs of intoxication under lithium therapy, further investigations should include serum levels and an EEG. Because intoxications can occur even in normal serum levels, discontinuation of lithium medication should be taken into account on the basis of clinical signs of intoxication. ","1133":"We report for the first time on a patient suffering from palinopsia after discontinuation of venlafaxine. Palinopsia is a rare and peculiar phenomenon which is defined as visual images that persist or recur after the stimulating object is removed and is often associated with posterior cerebral lesion or dysfunction. It also has been detected after usage of serotonergic drugs or in the course of antiserotonergic pharmacotherapy. Withdrawal symptoms after cessation of treatment involving serotonergic antidepressants are widely acknowledged in the literature, but still remain underestimated in clinical practice. It seems reasonable to suggest that clinicians should be aware of the risk of discontinuation symptoms in the case of serotonergic antidepressants, especially concerning those substances with a short half-life. If a decision is made to terminate therapy, it may be necessary to gradually reduce the dose over a number of weeks or to temporarily add a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with longer half-life.","1134":"","1135":"To capture the views on user involvement among employees in community mental health services in Austria. The Consumer Participation Questionnaire (CPQ), assessing views on user involvement in individual treatment as well as in planning, delivery and evaluation of mental health services, and basic information on the participants, was administered to 181 professionals. The data were analysed using descriptive statistical procedures. Differences in the opinions of four occupational groups - social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and \"other social professions\" - were calculated. The majority was supportive of user involvement and the expected benefit for clients and employees outweighed the anticipated risks. Differences in the views of professional groups arose in regards to setting therapeutic goals, evaluating services and the reasons assumed for clients not wanting to be involved. There is an inconsistency between the positive attitude of community mental health staff regarding user involvement and the actual lack of practical experience with such involvement in service planning and delivery in German-speaking countries. ","1136":"During the first half of the 19th century psychiatry became more and more influential in the evaluation of mentally ill offenders. \"Doubtful\" states of mind gained a particular importance for forensic practice. One of the mental disorders that was heavily disputed was amentia occulta (hidden madness) first described by the well-known Leipzig doctor and philosopher Ernst Platner. This publication (1797) preluded several other diagnoses to refer to non-obvious, \"hidden mental derangements\". Regardless of the differences in arguments as developed by the experts in question (E. T. A. Hoffmann, Merzdorff, E. Horn, J. C. A. Clarus), two case studies from the early 19 (th) century (D. Schmolling, J. C. Woyzeck) will exemplify the process of medicine, and psychiatry in particular, becoming more and more influential in everyday jurisdictional practice. The above-mentioned Ernst Platner, the author of manifold forensic studies and of \"De amentia occulta\", was one of the pioneers and promoters of this process. By emphasising the importance of mental states being evaluated by medical professionals he contributed a great deal to the establishment of forensic psychiatry.","1137":"","1138":"","1139":"In psychiatric contexts, the quick distribution of virtual techniques in private and professional everyday life gives rise to the question, if these can evoke a psychological addiction. Yet, the diagnostic assessment of internet or computer game dependency remains problematic. Within a study with 23 internet-dependent patients with significant psychological strain, 18 (77.8%) were diagnosed with a depressive mood disorder by thorough clinical examination and structured interviews. The presented work compares psychometric test results of the depressed subpopulation with healthy controls matched for age, sex and school education. In the Barrat Impulsiveness Scale patients with internet dependency scored significantly higher than the control group (p &lt; or = 0.05), while there was no significant correlation to the Internet Addiction Scale. Becks Depression Inventory and the Symptom-Checklist subscale for depression revealed significantly higher scores within the patient group as compared to controls (p &lt; or = 0.001). And in the Dissociative Experience Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale and the Inventory for Interpersonal Problems the internet dependent subjects showed significantly more pathological scores than the healthy subjects (p &lt; or = 0.05). Since internet dependency can be understood as a novel psychopathology of well known psychiatric conditions, every psychiatrist should be able to detect and treat it adequately, as long as there is a willingness to deal with the contents and impacts of cyberspace. Especially with depressed patients, it seems to be crucial to include questions about media usage in psychiatric examination taking. ","1140":"For the psychiatrist the association between depression and sexual dysfunction is of major importance since both affective and sexual disorders are highly prevalent and exhibit a marked co-morbidity. A high percentage of men and women suffering from depression reports sexual problems. In women, sexual desire is predominantly affected while in men both desire and erectile function tend to be impaired. However, the relationship between depressive mood and sexual dysfunction is bidirectional and further complicated by the sexual side effects of antidepressants which most often affect sexual arousal and orgasmic function. As a consequence, the sexual sphere should be adequately and routinely addressed in the assessment and treatment of all depressive patients.","1141":"Depression is a common comorbidity of chronic pain and chronic pain represents a common additional symptom of depressed patients. The physiological basis is unknown. We investigated the possible interrelation between autonomic dysfunction and altered pain perception in unmedicated patients (U1), after introduction of antidepressive therapy (U2) and after clinical remission. In accordance with previous reports we found increased thermal pain thresholds in our unmedicated patients. Cardiac autonomic dysfunction was not evitable in unmedicated, depressed patients. We conclude that autonomic dysfunction is unlikely to be involved in the pathophysiology of altered pain perception in depression.

Therefore, therapeutic touch, i.e. a direct body-to-body approach might be helpful in depression, as it has been known and practiced in medicine centuries ago. We investigated the antidepressive effects of an one hour lasting, relaxing, very sensitive soft treatment (Slow Stroke Massage) in a double controlled study comparing massage with a control condition and also comparing effects in depressed patients vs. healthy subjects. The treatment was repeated 5 times within intervals of 2-3 days. Data of 32 acutely depressed in-patients was analyzed. The pre-post-differences in various dimensions were significantly greater during massage than during the control condition. They were also more marked in patients as compared to healthy subjects. Slow Stroke Massage can be used effectively and safely as a complimentary therapeutic strategy in depressed patients. ","1143":"Therapeutic exercise programs have become an obligatory component in the modern treatment of many internal and orthopaedic conditions. In the field of psychiatry, the interaction of physical fitness and mental well-being has been increasingly recognized. In the meanwhile, solid evidence has emerged that regular exercise is associated with therapeutic effects in psychiatric patients suffering from depressive and possibly other psychiatric disorders. The present article reviews the relevant literature and summarizes neurobiological effects of exercise which might play a role in the effectiveness of therapeutic exercise. For instance, there is experimental evidence, that regular exercise induces a downregulation of central 5-HT(2C) receptors which play an important role in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression. The production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)is stimulated in several brain regions. In conclusion, practical aspects and motivational factors have to be regarded in order to successfully establish exercise programs in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.","1144":"Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disorder with a high prevalence of 2-6% in adults. The often distinctive clinical symptomatology has a great practical relevance and the diagnostic demarcation of other psychiatric illnesses can be difficult which underlines the necessity of a differential and careful diagnosis. ADHD is a risk factor for comorbid disorders like anxiety, personality disorders and addiction. Comorbid depression is also frequent and has an important meaning in the differential diagnostic process. A review was made about diagnostics and pharmacotherapy of ADHD with comorbid depression. For the combination treatment of ADHD with comorbid depression there are good pharmacological procedures of treatment. Here in particular modern antidepressants with noradrenergic or noradrenergic-serotonergic active principles play an important role. Very important is an exact diagnosis and differentiated treatment of ADHD, i.e. a \"multimodal therapy\" using pharmacological and psychotherapeutic concepts. ","1145":"This minireview summarizes the existing evidence from large, international observational studies and RCTs on the suicide preventive effects of lithium as compared to other mood stabilizers and antidepressants. Unsystematic literature review. There is increasing and robust evidence from a relatively large number of studies and metaanalyses that lithium long-term treatment reduces the suicide risk and overall mortality in patients with all kinds of depressive disorders (unipolar, bipolar, schizoaffective). Comparable evidence does not exist with regard to other mood stabilizers including atypical neuroleptics, or antidepressants. The existing evidence on the suicide preventive effect of lithium should be integrated in therapeutic guidelines and routine psychiatric care. ","1146":"Complex functional mechanisms underlie the etiopathogenesis of affective disorders. However, therapeutic implications of new insights are still limited. From the neuropsychological perspective therapy focuses on limbic-cortical (bottom-up) processes whereas cortical-limbic regulatory systems (top-down) were rarely mentioned, although first evidence of their relevance was given in the 80ties, e.g. the use of GABAergic anticonvulsants in affective disorders. Meanwhile modern brain imaging studies support a pronounced role of cortical-limbic top-down mechanisms in the regulation of mood and the therapy of depression, e.g. the effects of cognitive behavioural therapy. The article briefly reviews relevant literature focusing on the neuropsychological hypothesis and the therapeutic implications of these and pharmacologic data. Psychotherapy as well as anticonvulsants appear to mainly affect cortico-limbic mechanisms compared to antidepressants which influence mostly limbic-cortical processes. The combination of both regulatory systems, e.g. the combination of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, appear to have synergistic effects. Such combinations may also be effective in low doses of each compound which does, furthermore, reduce the amount of unwanted side-effects. Studies combining classical antidepressants and mood-stabilizing medication (anticonvulsants and newer neuroleptics) should be performed to substantiate these findings.","1147":"A systematic review on empirical results of current guidelines and recommendations with focus on efficacy and tolerability of antidepressant pharmacological treatment options. A critical, systematic evaluation of peer reviewed surveys, meta-analyses and guidelines is provided with the focus on evidence based consequences for the psychiatric clinical practice in the treatment of major depressive episodes. Most of modern and classic antidepressants have not proved differences in studies regarding comparative effectiveness. In contrast clinical decisions are increasingly guided by differences of tolerability, which are clearly documented in the current literature. Many algorithm based treatment options exist to face the common problem of treatment resistance. The multitude of effective antidepressant options provides an individual and patient orientated treatment. To achieve an optimal utilization of these options, an orientation on multi-step treatment plans is useful. ","1148":"To show the treatment situation for severely depressed in-patients in German clinics for psychiatry and psychotherapy. A questionnaire was sent to all German \"depression units\" including questions about number of beds and admission, treatment strategies and diagnostic profile in the year 2005. 65 of 71 clinics which are members of the \"Working Group Depression Units\" responded 52 reports could be used for the study. Treatment included antidepressants, psychotherapy, group therapies, psychoeducation, occupational and sport therapies, social work, cooperation with self help group for depressives and including relatives. German specialized depression units represent a high level of depression treatment. ","1149":"Day hospital treatment offers diverse therapeutical options for depressive patients. Which are those and which depressive clientele visits a general psychiatric day hospital? In order to find answers to this question the literature was searched, a 7-year-evaluation of the clientele of the day hospital of the Hannover Medical School and two vignettes are presented. The effectiveness of day hospital treatment for depressive patients is proved by the literature, especially for the elderly. Advantages and limitations of day hospital treatment in depressive patients are discussed including results of an own study. An individually adapted day hospital treatment can be an effective treatment for depressive patients. ","1150":"Conditions of human life, the personal and professional biographies of our patients and the medical development are subjected to continuous change. These transformations imply significant influences on the modalities of psychiatric treatment. Two cases of depressed patients born in 1905 and 1941, who were treated as inpatients for the first time in 1985 and 2004 and afterwards in the psychiatric outpatient department, are discussed against the background of their individual historical experience. Biographical knowledge about the changing conditions of patients' life facilitates an understanding of their individual concerns and therefore enhances their compliance. The fast change in medical frameworks implies the danger of neglect in the impact and meaning of biographical aspects for psychiatric therapy. ","1151":"Although depression and symptoms of depression belong to the most common disorders in private practice, affected patients are not always diagnosed as early as possible in Germany and often not sufficiently treated. In order to improve the care for persons with depression it is necessary that family doctors are prepared to guide these patients with empathy, treat them adequately pharmacologically both in respect to the depression and to all other somatic aspects and to refer them in time to specialists for psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine or psychotherapy. Political and social conditions that have pathogenic effects should be changed and the shortage of psychotherapy needs to be overcome. In future, the integrated care in ambulant and clinical settings will probably be successful, first trials and test setups have shown good results.","1152":"With the aim to improve the care of depressed patients and to reduce suicidality, the Nuremberg Alliance Against Depression was initiated 2001 in the framework of the German Research Network on Depression and Suicidality (funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research). The Alliance's concept is based on an intervention on four levels: Co-operation with GPs, an information- and awareness-campaign for the broad public, educational training for multipliers such as teachers, priests or geriatric care-givers as well as the support and initiative of self-help-activities. After two years of intervention the number of suicidal acts, the study's main outcome criteria, was significantly reduced by 24 percent compared to the baseline and to a representative control region. Since 2002 the successful four-level-intervention, its concepts and materials have been adapted by other regions within Germany. Nearly 40 community-based local campaigns are forming the German Alliance Against Depression (GAD) and many more regions are interested. On international level the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD) was established 2004. Funded by the European Commission the four-level-programme is implemented in 17 European countries.","1153":"Since the 1990's there is a change at many workplaces in industrialized countries. Work related depression emerges as a major cause of long-term sickness. The relationship between work and depression is bidirectional: work gives acceptance and self-confidence to the individual but stress at the workplace may precede depression. The relationship between work-related stress and depressive disorders is shortly reviewed. The underestimated costs of lost productivity by depression are so impressive that better preventional and interventional strategies are necessary to reduce early disability payments and to improve rehabilitation at the workplace.","1154":"To bring the data from the Federal German Health report about work disability and pensioning into context with current knowledge about the course and etiology of depression. The report data about first-time recipients of a disability pension were analysed by year, illness and gender. Resulting data were interpreted and were compared with international publications. The percentage of applications for disability pensions due to psychiatric illnesses have been rising steadily for two decades. Among these, depression (31%) and neurotic disorders (23%) are most frequently responsible, while most other causes of disability have been declining. Current treatment of depressive disorders does not seem to have had any effect in terms of reducing the number of disabled persons per year. Although the risk factors associated with developing a depressive disorder have been extensively studied, data explaining the progression into disability is scarce but essential. More research in the psychodynamics of depression and work participation might be helpful. ","1155":"Depressive disease is of increasing relevance in high income countries. This article summarises the current available specific knowledge about epidemiology, health-economic consequences and service provision for depression in Germany. Approaches for interventions to reduce the burden of depressive disease are presented and their potential discussed.","1156":"Depression contains a time-related philosophical background which can be characterized by the \"impact of the past into the present\" (M. Theunissen), an influence, which determines a psychic reality in melancholia and despontaneouses the presence. Thus depressive patients are trapped in a position of acknowledgement of the past. The neurobiological basis of this is explored using electrophysiological methods. A representation of the subjective position in depression is performed within the theatre work \"4.48 Psychosis\" by Sarah Kane.","1157":"Migrants do not always realize the burden of migration. Earlier negative personal experiences may gain relevance later in life, even in a new cultural or life context. This case report gives an example of different relevant factors, e.g. culture and living conditions, for the course of mental illness. We report on a female Brazilian patient, aged 37, suffering from schizoaffective psychosis with recurrent episodes. Obviously, stressful life events, the difficult relationship to her father and the expectations of her family were the trigger for psychotic episodes. The process and background of migration has to be considered to better understand the patient's situation and to optimize treatment. Biological, personal, cultural and life experiences are relevant aspects for relapse prevention. Migrants may be confronted with disadvantages resulting from cultural and communicative difficulties as an additive burden. Support from complementary health care is necessary to prevent further social isolation. ","1158":"Migrants belong to the hard-to-reach group in health and preventive care. Essential criteria for the sustainable effectiveness of preventive and health promotion consist in the proper selection of target groups and successfully approaching them. The knowledge of possible barriers that make the access to preventive care and health promotion more difficult, e. g. low health literacy, that means the difficulties of linguistic understanding or the low acceptance regarding the provider, is necessary in order to select adequate access possibilities to the defined target groups. Up to now, for this and particularly for the ethno-specific health behaviour of migrants in Germany information hardly exist. So far, there are only a few preventive offers which are target group focussed. The use of native speaking preventive consultants is an attempt to improve the access to preventive care for migrants by low threshold come and access-structures.","1159":"To assess the effect of cultural identification in Turkish immigrants living in Germany on attitudes towards psychotherapy. The approach to psychotherapy of 139 Turkish immigrants and 164 Germans was examined. Overall the Turkish population reported a less positive attitude towards psychotherapy in comparison to the German population. The Turkish immigrants with a less traditional cultural background reported a more positive attitude towards psychotherapy when compared to Turkish immigrants of a more Turkish identified traditional cultural background. Results suggest that culture-specific factors affect attitudes towards psychotherapy in Turkish immigrants, which indicates a need for intercultural psychotherapeutic education. ","1160":"Several studies have described a correlation between acculturation difficulties and mental distress, even mental disorders. The stress related to the process of acculturation can lead to mental disorders such as depression by way of a change in the activity of the HPA-axis. This correlation was examined in different samples of a total of 402 migrants. A significant correlation between mental distress and acculturation stress was found in all samples, yet no significant relationship between acculturation stress and length of residency in Germany. This non-representative, hypothesis generating study has to be replicated for samples of patients as well as other migrant groups not in treatment. A neurobiologically based specification of the definition of acculturation stress could be of relevant importance for prevention and clinical work. ","1161":"Knowledge about culture- and migration-specific characteristics of subjective illness beliefs in Turkish patients is necessary for adequate treatment. Analysis of subjective illness beliefs in Turkish patients (F3; F4; n = 79) in comparison to matched Germans (n = 79) using a modified version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire IPQ-R. Differences were explored by t-tests and chi(2)-tests. Turkish patients believed significantly stronger in a chronical timeline of illness and in negative illness consequences, while German patients believed significantly stronger in treatment control and personal control. Turkish patients more often mentioned external causes of their disease compared to Germans. The results provide explanations of the deficient health care situation for Turkish migrants in Germany. ","1162":"Due to the effects of globalization there has to be dealt with an increased number of immigrants in the German health care system. However, esp. the mental health care system in Germany is not sufficiently prepared for this challenge. It will be given an overview on the current situation of mental health care of immigrants with mental disorders. The aspect of creating specialized care units vs. opening established institutions for immigrants will be discussed. Examples of good clinical practice will be highlighted. Recommendations for opening the mental health care services for immigrants in Germany will be proposed. ","1163":"Young migrants from Russia born in German families are seen as a special risk group for drug and alcohol addiction as well as for criminality. In Russia, they were marginalized as Germans, now in Germany, they are marginalized as Russians--and they repeat in Germany the internal structures of distrust against the police and other government agencies. In prisons and in forensic units, this group of young German-Russians are strongly over represented compared with to share in the general population. In prisons, they are a problem group mainly speaking Russian language, forming mafia like clans and dealing drugs--all this prevents the rehabilitation. In sharp contrast, a forensic department succeeds in integrating these people by a consequent therapeutic community approach with highly frequent group psychotherapy, intensive work, sports, autonomy in cleaning the rooms and individual teaching possibilities in German language and other specialties with a teacher working on the ward. Despite published negative experiences, it is well possible to improve the legal and social prognosis of Russian-German migrants by applying a consequent milieu- and psychotherapeutic setting utilizing actively the resources of these patients. ","1164":"","1165":"This case report presents a rare, potentially life-threatening vegetative disturbance, which can occur during pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. A retrospective descriptive transversal and longitudinal section consideration of in-patient treatments of one female was performed. A 50-years old woman suffering from oligophrenia and disorganized psychosis (ICD-10: F71, F20.1; DSM-IV: 318, 295.10) successively evolved hypothermias up to 32.0 degrees C rectal, between them fever up to 40.0 degrees C rectal, hypothermia-accompanied bradycardias up to 32\/min, recurrent subclinical hypoglycaemias up to 55 mg\/dl and somnolence until coma under benperidol with levomepromazine or melperone, pipamperone with and without amisulpride, promethazine as well as zuclopenthixole. Within hours the hypothermias responded to antipsychotic drug holiday. No pathbreaking finding could be ensured on levels of internal medicine, toxicology, neurology as well as neurophysiology including a transient aetiologically uncertain partial insufficiency of the adenohypophysis. During long-term treatment with antipsychotics especially in higher dosage unpredictable vegetative crises may occur. Antipsychotics having pronounced 5HT2- and D2-antagonism seem to be rather associated with hypothermia. We recommend in case of hypothermia below 35,5 degrees C immediate antipsychotic or anticholinergic drug discontinuation, usage of benzodiazepines like lorazepam for a few days and a following trial with ziprasidone, aripiprazole or clozapine. These atypical neuroleptics show receptor binding profiles potentially advantageous in hypothermia. ","1166":"The number of ethnic German immigrants from former East bloc countries (Aussiedler) has considerably increased during the past 20 years. However, studies on the frequency of psychiatric disorders or on psychosocial risk factors for psychiatric morbidity in this partially inhomogenous population group are remarkably rare. We undertook a comprehensive research of the current literature to gain the first systematic review on this issue. The most frequent mental disorders among these special group of migrants were depressive disorders, adjustment disorders with brief depressive reactions as well as somatoform disorders, alcoholism and drug dependency. Ethnic German immigrants are a risk group for mental disorders. ","1167":"The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the disease burden of depression in Germany using preference-based valuations of depressive health states. The data came from the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD) in which a representative sample of 3555 non-institutionalised adults aged 18 years or older was interviewed in Germany. Computer assisted personal interviews included EQ-5D, SF-12, time trade-off (TTO) and contingent valuation (willingness-to-pay, WTP). Respondents in whom 12-month prevalence for a depressive disorder according to DSM-IV was identified, were compared to respondents without depressive disorders (controls). Disease burden was measured in terms of loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and loss of monetary benefit due to depression per year. Valuations of health-related quality of life (HRQL) were derived from EQ-5D (EQ VAS and EQ-5D Index), SF-12 (SF-6D Index) and TTO. Disease burden was estimated by calculating the difference between individual valuation of HRQL\/WTP for full health of cases and mean valuation\/WTP of controls matched by age and gender. Results were extrapolated to the total population. Depending on the valuation method, the loss of QALYs per year due to depression in Germany was 144,886 (TTO), 239,152 (EQ-5D Index VAS), 265,085 (EQ-5D Index TTO), 307,139 (EQ VAS) and 403,373 (SF-6D Index). The additional WTP for full health amounted to 4.3 billion Euro. Depressive disorders caused a substantial disease burden. Subjects affected by depression showed lower preference-based scores compared to subjects without depression. However, calculated QALY losses varied strongly by valuation method. ","1168":"The reduction of the frequency of rehospitalisation is important for improving the outcomes for patients with schizophrenia. This study compares the rate of rehospitalisation between patients with antipsychotics in depot-form (n = 77) and oral second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) (n = 156). Patients with antipsychotics in depot-form had lower risk of rehospitalisation than with SGAs in oral-form after 24 months (p = 0.027) and 36 months (p = 0.018) (Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis, Log-Rank). Long intervals between two hospitalisations were found for flupentixol depot and clozapine. Antipsychotics in depot-form require and active and close outpatient treatment, which may account for long intervals between hospitalisation improved outcomes for patients with schizophrenia. ","1169":"The nine \"priority practices for addiction\" in Mecklenburg-Western Pommerania participating in a model project are supposed to take a central and coordinating position within the addiction management. The aims of this study were to investigate a) the extent to which general practitioners are aware of these priority practices, b) the collaboration among general practices and priority practices and c) the predictors which promote cooperation. One third of all general practitioners in Mecklenburg-Western Pommerania (n = 330) were randomly sampled. Of these, 250 (75,8 %) practitioners (M = 51 years, SD = 10; 55,6 % female) participated in a 10 minutes telephone interview. About a fourth of the practitioners reported cooperation with \"priority practices for addiction\". Of all practitioners 53,8 % were not collaborating with these practices or did not know about them. Logistic regressions revealed distance to a priority practices as the only significant predictor which indicated if practitioners referred patients to these priority practices. CONCLUSIONS The concept of this unique project is largely unknown and insufficiently used by practitioners. It should be more strongly communicated within the medical community in order to improve the numbers of referrals. Above that, these specialised practices should be established throughout the country. ","1170":"A diagnosis of dementia as well as of mild cognitive impairment requires evidence of cognitive decline over time. Often, cognitive tests are administered to objectively measure cognitive change. However, changes in psychometric test scores do not necessarily result from true cognitive change. They might also be due to chance and to normal variability. This paper discusses why change norms are required for a reasonable interpretation of individual changes in test scores. Norms for change are lacking for most psychometric instruments used for dementia diagnosis in the German-speaking area.","1171":"Sociotherapy is an approved method in the treatment of mental disorders. The present study aimed at evaluating the role of sociotherapy in a scientific journal during the last 20 years. A systematic analysis of all papers published in the \"Psychiatrische Praxis\" in the years 1985\/1986, 1995\/1996 and 2005\/2006 was carried out. During the last two decades the proportion of papers with sociotherapeutic topics has decreased significantly. 20 years ago one out of four articles dealt with sociotherapy, currently only one out of ten. In addition, the spectrum of themes is diminished, only the topics work rehabilitation and relatives are represented in the latest issues of the journal. In contrast to its clinical value, sociotherapy has lost importance in psychiatric research. Multidisciplinary collaboration is required to enhance sociotherapy in mental health care research. ","1172":"The evaluation of local mental health and complementary psychosocial care remains a difficult venture. For this reason systematic development of appropriate services is barely possible. The present study aimed to get reliable data of psychiatric in- and out-patient treatment as well as of complementary psychosocial care. In the city of Frankfurt\/Main the PISA project was initiated by the municipal mental health Mo-Ruservice. 677 involuntary hospitalizations were examined in the psychiatric clinics of the city of Frankfurt\/Main with regard to diagnoses, socio-demographic data, complementary psychosocial outpatient care and circumstances of hospitalization. Any complementary psychosocial care was missing in more than seventy percent of patients. Only 10 percent of involuntarily admitted patients were examined by a physician before reaching the hospital and in only 1.3 percent the municipal mental health service had been consulted. Results show that a systematic improvement of precautionary complementary psychosocial care for risk patients is needed as well as the obligation of psychiatric emergency consultation before involuntary hospitalization. ","1173":"In recent years, the offense preventive effect of forensic therapy has been the subject of controversial debate. In this review, the current state of therapy evaluation research in forensics is discussed, with special consideration of methodological aspects. Systematic research of literature on studies that analyse the risk-reducing effect of offender therapies. The study designs are very heterogeneous and results are thus difficult to compare. Furthermore, there are only a few empirical studies on the relapse prevention efficiency of forensic therapies. Due to the methodological diversity of the studies, a concluding evaluation of the efficiency of forensic psychotherapies is not possible. The conclusions drawn from meta-analyses must thus be interpreted with great care. ","1174":"To provide an overview of diagnostics, outcome and treatment of \"non-schizophrenic psychotic disorders\" (ICD-10: delusional disorders, acute and transient psychotic disorders and schizoaffective disorders). Literature was identified by searches in \"Medline\" and \"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews\". The frequency of \"non-schizophrenic psychotic disorders\" within the whole diagnostic group \"schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders\" (ICD-10) ranges between 22% and 49%. Patients with these disorders show a more favourable long-term outcome than those with schizophrenia. With regard to therapy, as yet only a small empirical database exists. The comparability of those studies is limited by the use of different diagnostic criteria. There are only few evidence-based treatment guidelines for these disorders. There is a substantial need for controlled studies on the treatment of \"non-psychotic schizophrenic disorders\". Alternatively, clinical guidelines could be based on a dichotomy of affective and schizophrenic disorders or on a dimensional approach. ","1175":"Unemployment rates are high in people with schizophrenia, so that considerable importance is attached to measures to improve their ability to work and their vocational integration. In a study of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia the long-term effects of four-week vocational and ergotherapeutic measures on in-patients were investigated. The target criteria were the vocational integration, level of general functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning Scale) and psychopathology (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale). 227 patients were randomized and assigned either to a work-oriented vocational therapy group, or to a creativity-oriented ergotherapy group; 163 patients completed the study. Data was available for 89 patients at the last catamnesis point after two years. No differences were seen between the effects of the two forms of therapy on the development of vocational integration or on general functioning level and psychopathology after two years. The number of patients in regular work declined over this period. It is assumed from this that short-lasting vocational and ergotherapeutic measures do not have any long-term influence on the vocational integration of patients with schizophrenia. ","1176":"To examine statistical properties and the validity of a ward climate questionnaire for forensic psychiatric institutions. The 15 item instrument comprises three climate dimensions: Patients' Cohesion and Social Support, Safety (vs. threat by aggression and violence) and Therapeutic Hold. On 46 wards in 17 forensic hospitals in Germany, patients and staff filled in the climate questionnaire and further scales, among them the \"Ward Atmosphere Scale\" and a \"Good Milieu Index\". Problem events (e. g. wilful damage of property, drug relapse) were listed on each ward over a period of three weeks. 333 staff and 327 patients participated in the study. For both groups, factor analysis of item-intercorrelation generates clear 3-factor-solutions. Item-total correlation and the scales' internal consistencies (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73 - 0.87) are respectable. Correlation analysis evinces many substantial interrelations with other variables. Staff's climate assessments correlate much stronger with patients' climate assessments than with staff's job satisfaction. The climate questionnaire is an economic and valid instrument for assessing three meaningful aspects of the ward atmosphere in forensic psychiatry. An English version of the questionnaire--termed Essen Climate Evaluation Schema (EssenCES)--can be downloaded from the internet homepage of the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry Essen ( www.forensik-essen.de ).

For 37 modes of treatment used by 191 patients during their index-hospitalization (92 in day, and 99 in inpatient care) personnel costs were calculated. Data were analysed with non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U-tests and regression-analytic models for cost prediction. Day care patients caused mean costs of 1559.41 euro per person and received a mean of 198.8 treatments, whereas inpatients caused 947.22 euro and received 138.0 treatments. As concerns inpatient treatment, length of stay, the diagnosis of an ICD-10 F4-disorder, and the level of positive symptoms at admission could be identified as predictors of individual costs. For day hospital treatment, length of stay and illness chronicity contributed significantly to the prediction of individual costs. The direct health care cost advantage of acute day care--found in several trials which had performed unit-cost analyses--did not appear if personnel costs of the individually received non-pharmacological treatments were used as calculation basis. ","1183":"The study addresses the question whether, as often assumed, the symptoms of borderline personality disorders occur more frequently in transsexuals or not. We examined 164 transsexuals. The subjects completed the following questionnaires: The Borderline-Personality Inventory (BPI), the Freiburg Personality Inventory (FPI) and the Questionnaire for Assessment of One's Own Body (FbeK). In 80 % of all the examined transsexuals, there was evidence of symptoms of neither a borderline personality disorder nor of other personality disorders. If borderline symptoms occurred, they were predictable from the variables depressivity, low composure, low sociability and lack of confidence in relation to the external appearance. The data obtained refute the often-assumed increased relationship between borderline personality disorders and transsexuality. It should be assumed that a borderline personality disorder is primarily a psychiatric illness, while transsexuality is a disorder of gender identity in which secondary borderline symptoms may arise in some cases.

If we add to this the challenges that may be presented by a specific population at higher risk with little possibilities for thorough psychiatric evaluation, the task appears even more complicated. The \"Viennese Instrument for Suicidality in Correctional Institutions\" (\"VISCI\") presented here is based on the results of a case control study including all suicides in all Austrian jails and prisons between 1975 and 1999 and on research on literature examining suicide prevention in general and prison population in particular. Sensitivity and specificity of VISCI are presented. As suicide rates in custody are higher than in the general population, and these rates have been increasing within the last 20 years, the screening of offenders newly admitted to prison for their propensity to suicide is necessary to give a better estimation of the suicide risk and hopefully to stop further increase of suicide rates in jails and prisons. ","1190":"From April until November 2006, the association Irrsinnig Menschlich e. V. from Leipzig carried out the film festival \"Ausnahme|zustand\" about the topic Mental Illnesses all over Germany. The festival was on tour in more than 70 cities. The aim of the festival was to give the topic mental illness a podium, to inform and to entertain. A Pre-Post-Test was carried out to look for the effect of the documentaries shown on social distance of the audience towards mentally ill people. A total of 405 visitors to the film festival in Leipzig could be questioned. In addition, 104 other viewers could be questioned. As the results show, the effect on the viewers' social distance strongly depends on the content of the shown documentaries: A reduction as well as an increase of social distance were identified. For two of the documentaries no significant changes were found. It is noticeable that a highly selective group of people has been reached with this activity; with the main proportion of the visitors suffering from a mental illness themselves or knowing a mentally ill person. This is also reflected in the significantly lower social distance of the film festival viewers compared with the other viewers. It has to be taken into consideration that documentaries about mental illness do not automatically reduce stigma, and that these kind of activities will mainly attract people who are already sensitised for this topic. ","1191":"How does the interdisciplinary cooperation of psychiatric staff members change after a multiprofessional family systems training programme? Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 49 staff members. Quantitative questionnaires were used to assess burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI) and team climate (Team-Klima-Inventar, TKI). The multiprofessional training intensifies interdisciplinary cooperation. It results in an increased appreciation of the nurses involved and in a redistribution of therapeutic tasks between nurses, psychologists and physicians. Staff burnout decreased during the research period, while task orientation and participative security within teams increased. The multiprofessional family systems training appears suitable to improve quality of patient care and interdisciplinary cooperation and to reduce staff burnout. ","1192":"This is the first paper to analyse historical changes and trends in psychiatric reports in one German daily newspaper. A total of 4362 issues of the Leipziger Volkszeitung from 14 selected years of publication, 2 subsequent every 15 years starting in 1897, was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively, thus covering all relevant eras of German history (with the exception of the years of World War I and the era of \"National Socialism\"). The presentation of psychiatric issues changed from rather neutral reports to negatively connotated reports. On the other hand the language used altered significantly: from mostly paraphrases to the use of exact psychiatric terms. Unexpectedly, however, this did not have a positive or smoothing impact on the character of the report.

By using the pathogenetically more neutral term \"Pathological Internet Use\" (PIU) it is examined how frequently such behavior occurs in isolation and thus possibly as an independent condition and how often it occurs in the context of other psychiatric diseases. In the latter case PIU might merely be the consequence or a symptom of another underlying psychiatric disease. 30 persons with PIU were compared to 31 with intensive but not pathological internet use. A structured psychiatric diagnostic interview was carried out. The main finding is that in the group with PIU a psychiatric diagnosis was found in 27 of 30 persons (e. g. anxiety disorders: 50.0 %). In the group without PIU only 7 of 31 individuals (e. g. anxiety disorders: 12.9 %) had a psychiatric diagnosis. The finding that PIU occurs mostly in combination with other psychiatric diseases has a lot to commend against \"Internet addiction\" as a frequent and independent disease and gives reason for further in-depth studies to consider other psychiatric disorders in people exhibiting PIU with regard to diagnosis and therapy. ","1194":"Description of the three-year course of mental illness after supplying permanent housing to homeless individuals. 109-male and 20 female homeless individuals were assessed at the assignment of permanent housing and at one and three year follow-up using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. A high percentage (86 %) was able to maintain or even improve the index housing situation. Only minor changes were observed in mental illness severity and global functioning. Symptoms improved slightly over the three year period. High degrees of alcohol consumption and mental illness severity increased the risk of deterioration of the housing arrangement. Supplying homeless individuals with permanent housing is an effective measure but insufficient for improving mental illness. Combined measures of social and medical interventions from one provider are suggested for effective support of homeless people.

Major indicators have not been standardized yet, which is a serious obstacle for cross-boundary comparisons. Basic concepts, legal frameworks, service provision and prevalences in forensic care of 15 European Union Member States were assessed by an expert evaluation. Administrative data was compared and conclusions for a possible harmonization of approaches were drawn. The placement and treatment of mentally disordered offenders in the European Union Member States is characterized by a considerable variety of concepts and practice routines. National health reporting standards and the quality of available administrative data is poor. On the basis of available information, models of good practice are hard to choose. National and cross-boundary research should be intensified. Defining European quality and training standards in forensic psychiatry seems to be an activity to be started on a short term basis.

Within a six-months period 1200 postings of 135 users in two German language forums were analysed with respect to fields of interest and self-help mechanisms. The topics most discussed were social network of the patients, symptoms of the illness, and medication. Disclosure, online-group cohesion as well as empathy and support were the main self-help mechanisms. Our study reveals that the social network is very important for patients coping with bipolar affective disorders. We infer that the main interest in participating in online forums for bipolar affective disorders is to share emotions. Attention to those aspects should be given also in psychoeducative programs.

Throughout the course of schizophrenia depression is the most frequent symptom. Psychosis risk increases when depressive and anxiety symptoms increase and decreases when these symptoms decrease.

Prospective study of a sample of 794 non-demented elderly persons in the age bracket from 65 to 85 who were initially being treated in general hospitals. A cognitive screening with the SIDAM was performed during their stay in the hospital. After discharge the occurrence of dementia was determined in four follow-up studies at one-year intervals. During the follow-up, 100 newly developed cases of dementia were diagnosed. A lower performance in the SIDAM was associated with a significantly higher risk of the development of dementia. In comparison with the upper quartile in total SIDAM score the relative risk of a dementia amounted to 2.6 (1.0-6.8) for the second quartile, 4.5 (1.9-11.0) for the third quartile and 13.3 (5.7-31.1) for the fourth quartile. The highest predictive validity was found for memory performance, in particular for free delayed recall. Risk groups for dementia can be identified by the use of a brief cognitive screening procedure.

Trained interviewers presented written case vignettes to 68 NP and 122 FP during a structured interview. The case history described an otherwise healthy 70 years old patient complaining about cognitive disturbances suggesting incipient dementia. The survey is representative with a high response rate (71.8% FP and 67.3% NP). In both physician groups a vascular disease concept prevailed although the patient had no vascular risk factors. For primary and differential diagnosis NP considered depression more often. Overall only about 50% of physicians considered Alzheimer dementia. Regarding diagnostic methods the NP adhered significantly better to the current guidelines. While 31% of FP would apply dementia screening and 12% order neuroimaging, 76% and 74% of the NP mentioned these methods, respectively. There are negligible differences between NP and HA with regard to early diagnostic awareness of dementia. Vascular concepts prevail. However, both groups differ with regard to the diagnostic work-up. An increase of competence seems to be necessary in both groups. ","1206":"Evaluation of a three-year pilot project which aims to improve the quality of care of gerontopsychiatric patients. The project goal was to expand regionally organized outpatient services. We examined the profile (n=1004) and course (n=790) of patients treated at the Kaufbeuren regional Gerontopsychiatric Centre on the basis of sociodemographic, clinical, and care-requirement variables. There was a diagnostic predominance of dementia and depression. During the running time of the pilot project, only 13 % of the patients had to be admitted to inpatient care. The results suggest that the quality of gerontopsychiatric care improves through consistent efforts that are outpatient-oriented, mobile and multiprofessionally organized.

PTSD-criteria following ICD-10 were fulfilled in every case. All patients had a delayed subtype of PTSD with a latency of 14-60 years between trauma and onset of disorder. No case of chronic PTSD was found. In 26 cases a depression was diagnosed. Long latencies for PTSD are a typical feature in psychogeriatrics, possibly due to the situation in post-war-Germany probably even more in the Soviet occupied zone, the later German Democratic Republic (GDR). In the GDR it was not at all a public topic to speak about Russian violence (political taboo). The depressive and psychotic comorbidity of psychogeriatric PTSD-patients should be examined more specifically in future studies.

Although there have been frequent reports of changes in these two processes with increasing age, none of these changes has been demonstrated using objective measures. We evaluated time judgement by employing time estimation, time production, and time reproduction tasks in 33 healthy subjects of all age groups. In addition, we used the Trail-Making Test to measure attentional performance. For both time estimation and time reproduction, we found positive correlations between length of time interval and age (overestimation). After we calculated partial correlations controlling for the results of the Trail-Making Test, the age-related changes we initially observed in the time estimation task disappeared, but the age-related changes seen in the time reproduction task remained significant. Considering the Scalar Timing Theory and the Attentional Gate Theory, our findings indicated that age-related effects on time estimation may be due to attentional factors. In contrast, the age-related changes seen in the time reproduction task may be due to disturbances in working memory function.

This review gives an overview of the possibilities and methodological problems of QoL measurement in dementia patients. With literature searches conducted in PubMed and Web of Science 12 dementia-specific QoL-measures were identified. Most authors agreed that patients with mild to moderate dementia themselves can validly and reliably estimate their QoL. But with increasing severity of the disease, patient ratings must mostly be replaced by proxy ratings. The latter are especially essential in longitudinal studies, but are not a satisfying substitute for the patients' perspective. Thus, the influence of depression and care-related burden on the proxies' QoL-ratings should be controlled. QoL-instruments, applicable to all stages of dementia should be preferred, because longitudinal QoL-measures are more meaningful than cross sectional analyses. The patients' perspective should be taken into consideration as long as possible, since proxies assess the QoL of dementia patients differently from the persons affected.

By use of a system of categories developed with a content-analytical method, these national documents were comparatively assessed, and integrated into a common clinical recommendation. Legal and clinical pre-conditions for the use of mechanical restraint, specific instructions for the clinical behaviour of different professional groups, ethical issues, and procedural aspects of quality assurance are reported in detail.

The legal basis for such coercive measures is comparatively assessed by use of these documents. European countries seem somewhat hesitant to incorporate compulsory outpatient treatment into their civil legislation frameworks. Legal initiatives on this issue in Germany were rejected both on the level of the Federal civil law, and on the State-level of public administrative law.

About 85 % of the study sample showed more than four offences and more than 1.5 years of imprisonment before admission to the index-treatment episode. About half of the patients was successfully treated as indicated by being released on licence. Socialization in institutions, social disintegration before admission, and absconding during the index-treatment episode are important factors increasing the probability of declaring the hospitalization as useless. In the 2-year observation period, the criminal recidivism rate was 40.0 %. Social reintegration of this group of mentally disordered criminal offenders is as difficult as important. Findings on recidivism rates indicate a need for extending the number of specialized forensic outpatient departments and a need to focus on primary prevention.

This study intended to standardizedly assess the use of mechanical restraint and seclusion across German and Swiss hospitals. The frequency and duration of these coercive measures among patients with ICD-10 F1, F2, F3, F4 and F6 disorders was analysed in seven German and seven Swiss psychiatric hospitals in the year 2004. In Swiss hospitals more cases were exposed to seclusion. In German hospitals more cases were exposed to mechanical restraint. Seclusion as well as mechanical restraint per case were applied more often in German hospitals. Seclusion as well as mechanical restraint were of longer duration in Swiss hospitals.

Sector-specific rates and quotas for Germany as a whole and for the sixteen Federal States were calculated, and the change of these indicators between 1993 and 2003 analysed. Statistical modeling of epidemiologic and juridical data (\"Amtsgerichtsstatistik\") was performed. Against an overall increase of involuntary admissions into psychiatric hospitals per 100,000 population, the overall German percentage of involuntary admissions on all admissions into inpatient mental health care remained rather stable between 1993 and 2003. The number of legal coercive measures during inpatient stays has risen. On a Federal State level, these indicators varied considerably across the states and over time. An overall increase of involuntary admissions was not detected from the calculations. Detailed analyses of the increase of coercive measures during psychiatric inpatient stays are still needed. The implementation of a detailed reporting routine of these indicators is strongly recommended. ","1218":"An overview of compulsory admission and civil commitment in Germany is presented. Legal, administrative, and methodological aspects are described, to allow interpretation of long-term trends. The official court proceedings in all German federal states from 1992 to 2003 were statistically investigated. Admission data from psychiatric hospitals are reported. Total civil commitment rates, excluding those allowing physical restraint, increased from 24 to 55 per 100 000 inhabitants, being rarely applied in East Germany. Public commitment rates increased from 64 to 75. They remained stable in the old West German states with 80 (range 76 to 89), and increased in the new states (15 to 26). The total of all commitments increased by 38 %. Independent of compulsory admission, court decision rates with regard to physical restraint, which have been obligatory since 1992, increased markedly from 12 to 90. Taking into account the limitations of assessing court proceedings, there is no evidence for a strong rise of compulsory admissions in Germany. The actual number of compulsory admissions shows a tendency to stabilize on a high level, reflecting an increasing legal orientation and changing clinical practice with shorter treatments and more placements in hostels.

There is some evidence, that religion might be a possible resource for mental health in many cases, while some forms of religious beliefs also might have an impairing, destructive potential. The more religious someone is, the more relevant are his beliefs for his health. An attitude of openness and consideration, knowledge about the relations between religion and mental health, and ideological competence allow a sensible exploration of patients' religious beliefs, a cautious integration of religious issues and, if possible, the use of the beliefs as a resource for treatment.

Consideration of current results in addiction research should be an obligatory element of expert opinion and coercive treatment programmes in forensic facilities to provide for sufficient quality standards. Even when strict quality criteria are considered failures in placement of offenders with drug or alcohol addiction can not be ruled out. Besides scientific criteria a variety of other factors may influence the decision to coercive drug addiction therapy in a forensic facility e. g. jurisdiction or even tactical statements of the offender.

In this case the little knowledge the patient had of his schizophrenic disorder and his lasting lack accessing his illness in the context of a defensive mechanism were striking. Concurrently, the patient overestimated his loading capacity.

A systematic literature analysis of all works published in \"Psychiatrische Praxis\" - PP and \"Das Gesundheitswesen\"--GHW in the years 2004\/2005 was done. All works concerning Social Psychiatry were analysed. The same procedure was applied to all abstracts, posters and presentations for the annual meetings of the German Society of Social Medicine and Prevention (DGSMP). 10 % off all articles published in GHW and 97 % in PP address issues of Social Psychiatry. Apart from similarities in terms of their theoretical, practical and institutional background and the research methods applied, there are a number of differences.

We report on a patient with alprazolam dependence, who initially was treated with carbamazepine because of severe withdrawal symptoms. Due to liver enzyme elevation related to carbamazepine, we had to stop this treatment and instead of that started gabapentin treatment. Under this new therapy, the patient showed a dramatic relief of withdrawal symptoms and of the panic attacks recurring during withdrawal. Hence, due to their effectiveness and tolerability, newer anticonvulsants could be considered as medication for benzodiazepine withdrawal and as an alternative for benzodiazepine treatment in panic disorders.","1269":"To analyse the influence of structural (service) aspects and context (catchment area) variables on the individual use of socio-psychiatric services in Saxony.

For the analysis of the variance components a multi-level model with random effects was computed using data at two levels ([1] client, and [2] service\/catchment area). Service use was substantially influenced by structural\/context factors which accounted for a proportion of 10 to 50 % of the variance depending on the (sub-)group of users included in the analysis.

Retrospective examination of psychiatric cases treated in the ED of the Hannover Medical School in the year 2002. Patient characteristics were evaluated concerning diagnosis, technical examinations, therapeutic steps and data relating to the length of stay and patterns of usage of emergency services. 2069 psychiatric patients were seen in the ED. Additionally 563 psychiatric consultations were requested. Accordingly, psychiatry is the fourth most frequented discipline within the ED. 51.6 % of the patients were male, the average age was 43.5 years. Acute alcohol intoxication was the most frequent diagnosis with 20.2 %, followed by paranoid schizophrenia in 14.2 % and acute adjustment disorder in 6.7 % of the patients. Suicidal behaviour was present in 12.1 %. Psychiatric patients represent a large part of the general interdisciplinary ED. Data may support quality assurance and service planning.

Using estimation and test of contrasts in linear models of analysis of variance with structured covariance matrix, analyses conducted included data of all n = 191 patients having been included into the German centre of the study.

Compared to inpatient treatment, day hospital treatment saved approximately 24 % of the costs of the initial detoxification. Overall, additional inpatient treatments during the follow-up period produced more costs than the initial treatments, but no significant difference emerged between the treatment groups. About 75 % of costs for additional treatments were caused by 25 % of the patients. Lower costs of day treatment detoxification treatment are not annilihated by increased costs of additional inpatient treatments during the first year after discharge.

Patients showing psychiatric co-morbidity were excluded. By means of the WHOQOL-BREF, QoL was assessed in patients with OCD and in a sample of the general population of Saxony\/Germany. Compared with the general population, QoL in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders was lower in all domains of the WHOQOL-BREF.

In a cross-sectional study, statements of specific QoL-aspects in an open-ended interview with n=255 schizophrenic persons were correlated with subjective QoL ratings (Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List) and analysed for their predictive value by means of linear regression analysis. Stating the family and oral needs were positive, stating aspects of illness and negative well-being were negative predictors of subjective QoL, independent of age and gender. Substantial contributions to subjective QoL ratings were found when persons generally negated positive or, independently, generally negated negative aspects of QoL. The importance of a primary social network (family), of the illness and well-being for subjective QoL ratings could be replicated. It could be shown that \"oral needs\" are related to subjective QoL ratings. Moreover, there is further evidence for a resigning attitude towards life in schizophrenic persons and their impact on QoL ratings.

Predictors of quality of life were physical well-being, social and occupational integration, active problem-focused coping, less minimization of illness, voluntary admission to hospital, high satisfaction with treatment and life, being aware of positive changes as a consequence of illness and low-rated caregiver burden. In contrast, locus of control, sociodemographic and disease-related variables as well as medication (conventional or atypical antipsychotics) had no significant influence. Active problem-focused coping, social and occupational integration and physical well-being play an important role for schizophrenic patients' quality of life and should be considered in treatment regimens.

The quality of the first hundred resulting sites was assessed according to a range of criteria, including diagnosis and therapy, links and interactive offers. Evidence-based medical information was provided by more than half of the sites resulting from the search term schizophrenia and by less than one third of psychosis hits.

Experienced deficits in parental care and problems with poor communication within the family were also mentioned. Compared with controls they showed only light disadvantages in the level of education and vocational training.

As a consequence, combined approaches are often used, especially based on clozapine and olanzapine. This review aims to provide a critical overview on olanzapine-augmentations. A systematic database search including generic and trade names of antipsychotic substances as well as general items such as \"augmentation\" and \"combination\" was performed in Medline and BIOSIS (OVID) until May 2005. Amongst a number of 16 reports dealing with 9 different antipsychotic augmentation strategies (85 patients) only sulpiride was tested in a randomized manner. A significant part of the treatments achieved favourable results. In contrast, augmentations of olanzapine with antidepressants or mood stabilizers were evaluated in well-designed clinical trials (9 strategies, 10 publications, 837 patients). Improvements of positive and\/or negative symptoms as well as depressed mood were reported.

In both settings, admission status was the strongest predictor of discharge status. As concerns day-hospital patients, those suffering from a personality disorder as well as those showing a higher degree of social disability were discharged with a higher level of psychopathological symptoms. Among inpatients, those suffering from an anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, or adjustment disorder as well as those being retired or unemployed benefited less from treatment.

The course of the contacts and the further help-seeking behavior after 4 and 8 months were registered. The very sporadic participation of the patients in the therapeutic discussion permitted a manualized procedure in individual cases only. The establishment of contact was very successful, but the problem-centered procedure only within limits. The intergroup comparison revealed no fundamental differences in the utilization of offers of support during the course of the study. Overall, however, the number of users tended to increase, with an increased contact frequency being recorded especially among those participating in therapeutic discussions. Only a relatively small proportion of the clientele can be reached through short-term behavior therapy. Fundamentally a low-profile, primarily outreach-based offer founded on longer-term contact appears to be more promising.

Based on the relevant literature, the psychological implications of predictive diagnostics are outlined, and counselling strategies for persons vulnerable for an inherited disease are summarized. In spite of numerous studies with persons at risk the prediction of the individual reaction remains rather difficult. Unconscious expectations play an essential, but underestimated role for the test motivation and coping strategies. Relieving the pressure of time supposed by most of the risk persons seems necessary to allow a deeper understanding of motivation and development of sound coping strategies.

We report on a 45-year-old man with moderate dementia due to hypertensive encephalopathy who was involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital by a court order because of his refusal of dialysis. Dialysis could be carried out with moderate coercion in a general hospital and was subsequently accepted by the patient after two treatments. The protest of the psychiatric hospital against the obligation to provide dialysis by coercion was accepted by the superior court some weeks after discharge of the patient, because dialysis is not provided in the psychiatric hospital. Though a good outcome could be achieved in this particular case, many questions remain unclear concerning the feasibility of dialysis under coercion in cases of patients with impaired capacity to give informed consent, and the legal responsibility for the realization of court orders.

In general, the efficacy of involuntary medication has been poorly evaluated in inpatients, two randomised controlled trials from the U.

Therefore, the empirical database on aspects of clinical safety of involuntary medication is quite small. However, a considerable body of literature exists with respect to patients' opinions on involuntary medication, mostly demonstrating a highly critical attitude. Some European countries already have guidelines, but the overall situation suggests the need for further improvement. In 2004, the EU Council ratified a guideline for future European legislation on involuntary treatment of people with serious mental illness (white paper).

The quantitative content analysis refers to the answers to the open questions of the CAT by all day hospital patients and inpatients in the Dresden project centre who completed the questionnaire one week after admission and again at discharge. Day hospital patients as well as inpatients assessed their treatment altogether as pleasant and effective. Interpersonal contact to the staff and other patients was evaluated as sound and helpful. Differences between the settings appeared primarily with regard to criticisms: Day hospital patients were mainly dissatisfied with their daily routine, inpatients criticized particularly structural conditions such as premises and food. In case of a hospital readmission, the majority of the patients would prefer that setting they had been randomised to within the EDEN-study. However, a tendency to prefer treatment in the day hospital was found. Acute mentally ill patients provide a substantially favourable assessment of both day hospital and inpatient care. Particularly the criticism of the day hospital patients contains important information for improving the quality of psychiatric care.

In order to address this demand we designed a new psychoeducational program for outpatients, which -- in contrast to traditional psychoeducation -- attaches as much importance to quality of life topics as it does to illness related topics. The seminar was developed especially in view of the score resources available today. First results of the evaluation are presented. Psychiatrists in the community are encouraged to refer patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders to this psychoeducational program as an additional component to regular treatment. The program is carried out in 9 group sessions at weekly intervals with 6-8 group members. At the beginning and at the end of the seminar different objective and subjective outcomes were assessed and predictors for seminar success were identified. 98 participants could be included in data analysis. After completing the program the seminar participants had significantly more knowledge about the illness, a significantly better quality of life and significantly more competence and control. Furthermore there were changes in the illness concept: prejudices about medication decreased, confidence in medication increased, and beliefs about susceptibility to illness and to relapse increased.

This is followed by a review of randomised controlled trials investigating the treatment efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions. These studies show positive results particularly for psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioural therapy and family-oriented therapy. Finally, it is discussed in which respects evidence for the successful implementation of psychotherapy is still missing and why it is so important to move towards manualized psychotherapeutic programs.","1333":"The article provides an overview of published treatment manuals for psychotherapy in bipolar disorders and discusses content and structure of manualized programs. This is followed by a more detailed description of an elaborated psycho-educative program which have successfully been applied in individual as well as in group settings for the education of inpatients, outpatients and patients' relatives. Future research needs to further evaluate existing programs in terms of treatment efficacy.","1334":"In this article the contribution of neuropsychological research for a better understanding of the psychopathology of mood disorders is reviewed. First, the broad spectrum of bipolar disorders is described. Second, a selective review of important results of neuropsychological studies with patients with mood disorders is presented. Although several methodological problems limit the interpretation of the findings, there is evidence that patients with a bipolar disorder show a consistent impairment in attention, memory\/learning and executive functions. The cognitive deficits are still visible during clinical recovery (euthymia) and closely associated with psychosocial limitation in daily life. Finally, the impact of neuropsychological findings is considered in relation to assessment, treatment and prognosis.","1335":null,"1336":"Until recently, the psychopharmacological treatment alternatives for bipolar maintenance treatment were limited to lithium, which seems of special usefulness in a classical manifestation of the illness with mood-stabilising and anti-suicidal properties. With atypical features like psychotic symptoms or rapid cycling, lithium seems to be less useful. This led to further research into alternative options as carbamazepine, valproate or lamotrigine as well as atypical neuroleptics, thyroid hormones or innovative substances like omega fatty acids. This article summarises the current state of knowledge on treatment options for maintenance therapy.","1337":"Manic disorders and bipolar psychoses have long been underdiagnosed in child and adolescent psychiatry. Scientific research has been rare as well. In particular in adolescence and young adulthood bipolar disorders are not easy to diagnose. Therefore these disorders should be included in differential diagnosis as research from the U. S. shows that there is a significant number of these treatable patients. Being untreated sufficiently major setback in social development and quality of life occur, as severe as in schizophrenia. Adequate medication and psychotherapy in the early phases of these chronic disorders ameliorate the overall prognosis. Special attention should be drawn to hypomanic phases and phenomena as rapid cycling.","1338":"Mixed episodes comprise up to 40 % of acute bipolar admissions. They are difficult-to-treat, complex clinical pictures. This review provides an overview of the available literature on the pharmacotherapy of manic-depressive mixed states and suggests treatment options. Literature was identified by searches in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Studies were considered relevant if they contained the keywords mixed mania, mixed state (s), mixed episode (s), treatment, therapy, study or trial. Overall, there were very few double-blind, placebo-controlled studies specifically designed to treat manic-depressive mixed states. Rather, patients with mixed states comprised a subgroup of the examined patient cohorts. Nevertheless, the data show that acute mixed states do not respond favourably to lithium. Instead, valproate and olanzapine are drugs of first choice. Carbamazepine may play a role in the prevention of mixed states. Antidepressants should be avoided, because they may worsen intraepisodic mood lability. Lamotrigine may be useful in treating mixed states with predominantly depressive symptoms. More treatment studies specifically designed to treat the complex clinical picture of mixed states are clearly needed. Current treatment recommendations for clinical practice based on the available literature can only target selected aspects of these episodes. ","1339":"Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that has shown efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia without causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). To date, there are two monotherapy and two combination therapy studies with a double blind, placebo-controlled design on the use of quetiapine in mania. Several open studies and case reports support the results of the controlled trials suggesting that quetiapine is effective in treating the broad spectrum of manic symptoms and is tolerated well.","1340":"Olanzapin is an atypical antipsychotic drug, which is approved for use in acute mania and in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. There are eight double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, which show its efficacy in the treatment of acute mania, five, which document its efficacy in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder and one that shows its use in bipolar depression. The following overview presents and critically evaluates these studies. Quality of life aspects on olanzapine treatment and the safety profile of the drug will also be discussed.","1341":"In patients with bipolar disorder antipsychotics are frequently used for the treatment of acute manic episodes, either in monotherapy, in addition to a mood stabilizer or in patients refractory to lithium or other mood stabilizers. However, a number of studies demonstrated that the use of conventional neuroleptics is restricted -- particularly for long-term treatment and relapse prevention in bipolar disorder -- due to their side effect profile and their potential to induce or worsen depressive symptoms. In contrast, atypical antipsychotics have a better tolerability profile and fewer extrapyramidal side effects. A number of clinical studies showed that the atypical antipsychotic risperidone was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of bipolar mania. This was reported both for the treatment of acute episodes and for the maintenance therapy. Recent data suggest that risperidone can be used effectively either in addition to or even instead of a mood stabilizer. This review summarizes the available literature on risperidone in the treatment of bipolar disorders.","1342":"The needs and expectations of patients with bipolar disorder who require hospitalisation are not known to most professionals. A high degree of patient satisfaction, however, is known to improve outcome and adherence to a medication or psychotherapy regimen. In this article, bipolar patients' needs and expectations with respect to hospital treatment are presented. It will become obvious, that the gap between wishful thinking and reality is still wide. Possible improvement strategies to narrow this gap are discussed.","1343":"There are several national and international practice guidelines on the treatment of acute mania. Their purpose is to assess the available evidence of efficacy for medication used in the treatment of bipolar mania and to grade it according to the quality of studies available. The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) has developed such guidelines in 2003. They categorize the scientific quality of the studies into four levels of evidence (A-D) and provide an algorithm based on the degree of severity of the acute manic episode.","1344":"After rapid discontinuation of clozapine treatment rebound psychosis have been reported. Preexposure of D (2) receptors to clozapine may alter their affinity to endogenous dopamine. Clozapine withdrawal may also lead dysfunctional NMDA-receptors to cause dopamine release in the striatum. We report a case of a schizophrenic patient treated with clozapine 200 mg and aripiprazole 15 mg per day. After rapid clozapine discontinuation we added quetiapine up to 700 mg daily. No rebound psychosis occurred. Even ten weeks after switching to quetiapine the patient's condition remained stable in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. The combination of aripiprazole and quetiapine seemed to control supersensitivity effects at the D (2) receptor after clozapin withdrawal in this case. ","1345":"Psychological side effects of the therapy with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) have frequently been reported. The symptomatology varies, although there seems to be a predominance of depressive complaints. Mediating somatopsychological vs. psychosomatic pathways remain unknown so far. We describe the case of a 26-year old female inpatient suffering from hepatitis C infection. During medical treatment with interferon-alpha, a transfer to a psychosomatic unit became necessary due to increasing agitation, somatization and a lacking response to psychopharmacological medication. After the discontinuation of IFN-alpha-treatment, the patient's gradual emotional stabilization could be attained. In psychotherapy, inner conflicts as well as fears about possible side effects of the medication were worked through. After discharge, parallel to an ambulatory psychotherapy, the IFN-alpha medication was readministered and completed successfully. As long as aetiology and mechanisms of psychic side effects of IFN-alpha-treatment remain unclear, ward-based integrative psychosomatic psychotherapy can be supportive and enlightening with regard to psychosocial factors of influence on the IFN-alpha-induced side effects. ","1346":"To assess the contribution of sociodemographic and psychopathologic predictors for suicide in alcohol-related disorders and in substance-related disorders in general and to examine the constellations of risk factors for suicide. Out of 163 suicides (using psychological autopsy method) and 396 population-based control persons, 67 suicides and 67 controls with substance-related disorders (DSM-IV; alcohol-related disorders: suicides: n = 36, controls: n = 27) were assessed. Affective disorders, suffering from substance dependence, and low education independently predicted increased suicide risk in alcohol-related disorders as well as in substance-related disorders in general, severe nicotine consumption only in alcohol-related disorders. There are common risk factors for suicide in alcoholism and substance-related disorders in general. Effective suicide prevention strategies must include a focus on substance dependence as well as on affective disorders. ","1347":"The study was intended to evaluate the therapeutic and healthcare services utilized by 116 former long-stay patients after an average of 42.9 months of deinstitutionalization during a follow-up time of (1\/2) year and to calculate the costs thus incurred. 116 patients and their caregivers were interviewed during a period of 6 months using the German version of the Client Sociodemographic and Service Receipt Inventory. On average, 3.3 institutions\/facilities were contacted per patient, most often by younger patients living in group homes and least often by patients in psychiatric nursing homes. During the 6-month follow-up time costs of euro 14,665 were incurred per patient. Of these costs, 87.2 % were for the residential facilities. The costs of outpatient care accounted for 41.4 % of the costs that would have been incurred for inpatient care in a psychiatric hospital. Deinstitutionalization of psychiatric long-stay patients in Upper Austria provided for considerable reductions in costs while maintaining a high quality of care. ","1348":"The aim of this study was to explore, using a simple qualitative design, how community mental health staff in Austria perceive their job. 195 community-based mental health professionals answered seven open questions on how they perceive their job. The main areas covered were the most important tasks of the job, skills necessary to perform these tasks, as well as positive and negative aspects of the job. Answers were subjected to thematic content analysis. For most professionals, contact with clients and team colleagues were the major rewards of the job. Aspects experienced as stressful were the clients' illness, role ambiguity, team conflicts and lack of time. Necessary skills many respondents did not feel competent in were specialised knowledge and psychosocial skills. It might be useful to revise existing forms of collaboration within multiprofessional teams. The responsibility for difficult patients may be shared by several members of the team, who should contribute their specific knowledge. Training should be tailored towards the needs of the different professional groups and focus on those skills that are required in community mental health care. ","1349":"User involvement in mental health services research is discussed in Great Britain, and a number of user-led research initiatives can be found. In Germany, less attention is paid to the concept while virtually no initiatives can be found. The concept of user involvement is introduced by reviewing the relevant literature. After discussion of theoretical and methodological implications, practicability of the concept for mental health services research is illustrated by some examples from Great Britain. User involvement in mental health services may promote the provision of user focused services. User involvement aims at the empowerment of mental health service users and can also improve the quality of mental health services research. Frequently, user-led\/collaborative studies are focused on mental health service assessment. Some problematic aspects (e. g. representativeness, knowledge\/skills of users) are discussed. Although more research is needed to document the additional benefit of user involvement in mental health services research it is conceivable that the concept will gain in importance.

We report about a 44-year old schizophrenic male who has been detained in a closed forensic ward for 10 years, following a conviction in one manslaughter case. Despite various pharmacological treatment efforts severe residual schizophrenia remained. Adding Amisulpride to the ongoing treatment with Olanzapine achieved a noticeable improvement of symptoms, resulting in the possibility of relaxing imprisonment conditions. A combination of Amisulpride and Olanzapine seems to be effective in treating severe residual schizophrenia. ","1354":"For some decades, vocational therapy approaches have been an integral part of inpatient psychiatric treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Like most sociotherapeutic measures, they are largely hypothesis-based. So far, their effectiveness has been subjected to very little scientific scrutiny. The results of a multicenter study in which five vocational therapy models were compared with creativity-oriented ergotherapy in a prospective, randomized control group design are presented. Target criteria were job-relevant skills, psychopathology, general level of functioning, quality of life, self-efficacy, and speed of cognitive performance. 227 patients were enrolled in the study, which was carried out within the framework of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF). Multicenter analyses in a pre-post comparison revealed only minimum differences between the experimental and the control group over a four-week intervention period. Job-oriented approaches cannot currently be assumed to be superior to creativity-oriented ergotherapy.","1355":"The importance of causal attribution for Turkish and German patients with a psychotic disorder for the diagnostic process was examined. Within a controlled clinical study Turkish and German patients were interviewed regarding their concepts of cause of illness. There was no difference between the two groups - in both around half the patients gave a response categorized under \"psychosocial stress\", while in both groups only about one fourth gave culture specific responses, with no difference even when looking at potentially misdiagnosed cases. Culture specific causal attributions for psychotic disorders do not seem to be as important as the literature implies. Nonetheless in securities in diagnostics and treatment make it necessary to acquire a better understanding of these views. ","1356":null,"1357":"From the perspective of developmental psychology, schizophrenia constitutes a serious developmental risk, since it obstructs a \"normal\" psychosocial development. Hardly any investigations up until now have focused on this important aspect. To investigate in an explorative study the developmental problems in families with an adult child with schizophrenia. Parents of schizophrenia patients were interviewed within the scope of narrative interviews about their familial situations and their relationship to the patient. The data were selected and analysed following the guidelines of Grounded Theory and Thematic Field Analysis. Patients with schizophrenia often remain dependent on their parents' emotional, practical and financial support. Typically, the parent-child-relation is re-intensified, often with a co-occurring loss of extra-familial social contacts. From a biographical point of view, schizophrenia is often connected with permanent parenthood and lifelong parental help. Support offers for families should take into account illness-related developmental problems, especially problems regarding the difficult detachment of the patients from their parents. ","1358":"International surveys found an increase of mentally disordered individuals in correctional institutions. As a consequence, suicides and suicide rates in jails and prisons are increasing. Mental health services and criminal justice authorities have identified this problem, but there is a lack of knowledge concerning risk factors for inmate suicides and practicable prevention. A literature research was conducted through \"medline\" searching for studies addressing the problem of jail and\/or prison suicide. Subsequently, results of relevant surveys were compared and depicted in several tables. Suicide rates in correctional facilities significantly exceed those in the general male population. Suicide rates in custody have been increasing within the last decades. Pre-trial prisoners have the highest suicide risk within the total prison population. Long-term sentences, single-cell use, mental illness, substance abuse and a history of suicidality are associated with an increased suicide risk. The impact of suicide prevention strategies and future directions of research in this high-risk setting are highlighted. ","1359":"","1360":"","1361":"","1362":"","1363":"A renaissance of electroconvulsive therapy in psychiatry can be observed in Germany. Here, ECT was named as a first line therapy for treating psychotic depression, depressive stupor, schizoaffective psychoses with severe depressive symptoms. Suprisingly, ECT is most commonly not used as a continuation therapy after achieving acute remission. With rare exceptions, antidepressive medication is chosen for this purpose. The use of continuation ECT (cECT) and subsequent maintenance ECT (mECT) is not (or just marginally) mentioned in practice guidelines. In our case report we report a successful cECT and mECT of a geriatric patient with severe comorbidity. This case is exemplified with respect to recent guidelines and study results. Particularly suggestions for interval duration, total duration of treatment, effects on cognition and memory, comorbidity and comedication, and reflections on quality of life and costs were discussed. We would therefore recommend a broader use of this proven treatment tool for keeping major depressions in remission.","1364":"Recently, there has been a growing awareness among psychiatrists of the stigma of mental illness. In numerous countries programs aimed at reducing stigmatization and discrimination because of mental illness have been launched. The question arises as to what extent the increasing interest in stigma has stimulated research in this area. A search for papers on stigma of mental illness that have been published in scientific journals since 1990 has been carried out, using different search strategies. During the 1990 s, there is a marked increase of articles dealing with the stigma of mental illness. There is no indication of an end of this trend. Despite more research we are still far from understanding the stigma process in detail. This, however, is the prerequisite for developing successful anti-stigma interventions. ","1365":"An international network study involving parallel, complementary interventions in three EU countries and an associate country (Germany, United Kingdom, The Netherlands and Norway) is reported. The aim is to develop a unified approach to the assessment of social risk and related behaviours in offender groups. The Behavioural Status Index (BEST-Index) and a set of cross-validating instruments (PCL-R, HCR-20; SCL-90-R; BDHI-D) were applied to a sample of n = 231 mentally ill offenders. Selected results using a sub-sample of n = 89 German offenders are reported and discussed. The BEST-Index shows convergent validity with respect to a social risk criterion and it helps to determine an objective data base for the improvement of carer assessments, related care planning, and delivery. ","1366":"The aim of this study was to explore job satisfaction, professional role and burnout among community mental health staff in Austria. The Minnesota Job Satisfaction Questionnaire, the GHQ-12, the Maslach Burnout Inventory and a questionnaire exploring staff's professional role and team identity were administered to 195 community-based mental health professionals in two Austrian regions. Staff's job perception was assessed in open questions. Predictors of burnout scores were identified in multivariate analyses. While the mental health professionals had elevated scores on the GHQ-12, their levels on the three burnout subscales were low. Social workers and psychologists showed the lowest job satisfaction, social workers also had low role identity scores. Being in the current job for a short time and disposing of psychosocial skills were predictors of high job satisfaction. High burnout scores were predicted by the lack of basic psychosocial competence and a lack of general knowledge in mental health care. The effect of caseload on psychological well-being was positive as well as negative. Even if the mental health professionals in our study show high levels of general stress, they seem to have less emotional problems resulting from extensively dealing with troubled individuals. Improving basic psychosocial competence and general expertise in mental health care might have a protective effect against developing a burnout syndrome. ","1367":"This study provides an overview of the research on suicide rates and suicidal tendencies of physicians. Original articles on this topic since 1980 were analyzed. Empirical studies indicate an increased suicide rate in physicians compared to the general population. Possible causes are the increased prevalence rate of depressive disorders as well as the presumably increased rate of substance abuse in physicians. In addition to this, job-related stressors as reasons for the high suicide risk in physicians are discussed. In terms of preventive measures it seems reasonable to systematically inform medical students about stressors they will be exposed to in their later practice and to discuss coping strategies and prevention. Thus, a suitable emotional preparation for future work stress can be assured. For working physicians seminars and professional training on education and prevention as well as supervision should continuously be offered.

We report four cases of patients with clinically and genetically established Huntington's disease and signs of psychosis who were treated with Amisulpride. Two patients developed extrapyramidal side effects due to the treatment. The antipsychotic therapy of all patients was effective. Due to degeneration of striatal neurons patients suffering from Huntington's disease react early with development of extrapyramidal side effects after therapy with amisulpride. ","1373":"Currently, substantial effort is made to establish prevention as one of the main parts of the German health care system. In this context we investigated the current role of prevention in social-psychiatric research. We analysed original papers published in the journal Psychiatrische Praxis in the years 2003-2004 by computer-aided full text analysis. 16.5 % of the studies mentioned prevention, in one fourth of these, prevention was the main topic. Subject of these papers were suicide prevention in psychiatric patients, relapse prevention in mentally ill offenders, and prevention of acute confusional state after hip surgery. Most of the work was dedicated to tertiary prevention, followed by secondary prevention. Two papers mentioned primary preventive aspects and only one report was dedicated to primary prevention as a main topic. Although early diagnosis and intervention as well as rehabilitation of mental disorders are main topics of social psychiatry, only few reports relate explicitly to prevention. The role of social psychiatry in primary prevention has to be defined. ","1374":"To report attitudes of psychiatrists and neurologists towards compliance with regard to medication-taking behaviour of patients suffering from schizophrenia. A questionnaire was sent to psychiatrists and neurologists practising in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. Out of a total of 120, 54 completed questionnaires were returned. Most of the experts defined compliance as the degree of fidelity to treatment recommendations and patient cooperation. In the experts' view, a positive attitude towards treatment, insight into illness, and accurate perception of the symptoms correlate strongly with compliance, whereas the association between sociodemographic characteristics and compliance was seen as moderate. A majority of experts considered there were changes in compliance over time. With regard to the improvement of compliance, the importance of the doctor-patient-relationship is supported by the results of our study. As ratings of doctors suggest, compliance is a broadly determined behaviour which is variable over time. Future research on medication-related compliance in patients suffering from schizophrenia should take into account these findings. ","1375":"At the end of their treatment, 48 patients, having attended the day clinic of a general psychiatric hospital, evaluated important aspects of their therapy. These evaluations were analysed. In resulting with the norm sample of the inpatient experience questionnaire (SEB), more positive values were obtained for all the scales. The scales \"experiences of relationship to individual therapist\" and \"experiences of relationship to the therapeutic team\" yielded the highest values for patient satisfaction. We found that the categories of \"general documentation about change through treatment\" within the Psy-BaDo are relevant for patients attending a day clinic treatment. There is evidence for a large improvement with respect to all categories. Highest changes were reported for the subjects \"understanding of the individual illness\", \"body symptoms\" and \"psychological well-being\". Smaller changes were reported for the subjects \"private relationships\", \"relationships in job\" and \"social problems\". Compared to the patients, the therapists' estimate of the changes were lower. On an individual basis, the assessments of the patient and therapist agreed well. Sociodemographic characteristics and other criteria of the illness and therapy were not well associated with the scales of the SEB and the categories of Psy-BaDo. Only the duration of symptoms and the frequency of previous inpatient therapies were clearly associated with the categories of Psy-BaDo. The data, derived from standardized questionnaires, enable comparisons to be made between different institutions and provide evidence for a very positive evaluation of the investigated treatment.","1376":"The war neurosis, mainly observed during the first World War, caused a lively debate on its origin and etiology. In psychiatric history this debate is often portrayed in a somewhat simplifying manner. Namely Oppenheim was considered as the leading exponent of the organic etiology of traumatic neurosis, while others, with growing interest in psychodynamic theories, were thought to favor exclusively psychogenesis of this condition. However, only discussing matters in this way would be too simple. Rather, the controversy was much more differentiated and led to important insights: First, it turned out to be impossible to explain any psychopathological syndrome exclusively in terms of neuropathological, i. e. structural alterations, in particular, a syndrome presenting with a sudden onset of dissociative and conversion symptoms. Secondly, the psychiatric theory of hysteria of Charcot and Freud was developed and extended further. And, last, the etiology of war neurosis was recognized to be multifactorial. Thus, the discourse on this issue was not one-dimensional and favoring a single explanation for a complex disorder, but revealed \"pluridimensional\" features. Subsequently psychotherapy, for the first time, was widely introduced into clinical practice with a clear indication and well-defined methodological approach. In summary, war neuroses can be addressed as an early model of traumatic stress disorder, such as acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder.","1377":"","1378":"","1379":"","1380":"The study investigates the concepts of psychological trauma and their changes over time in psychiatric textbooks published in German between 1945 and 2002, assuming that textbooks reflect the established and dominating views of their time. [corrected] In psychiatric textbooks, the terminology, concepts of illness, and recommendations for assessment and treatment concerning psychological trauma were analysed. The concept of psychological trauma that had existed since 1916 continued to dominate textbooks up until the 1960s. Findings on holocaust survivors entered textbooks not before the mid 1970s. Since the mid 1990s, the concept of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder has been widely established in textbooks. Changes of dominating views on this issue in textbooks appear to have been extremely slow and occurred with significant delays in the past. The change of the dominating view in the 1970s was linked to the establishment of a new generation of leading psychiatrists. Since the introduction of PTSD, psychiatric textbooks have given up a previously negative attitude towards patients suffering from psychological trauma.

A community sample from the Study of Health in Pomerania (N = 4310) was investigated with the \"Beschwerdenliste\" from von Zerssen. The met and the unmet need of care were estimated. 3.1 % of all subjects were treated at least once by a mental health professional during the last 12 months. 12 % of the subjects, currently not in treatment, were estimated to be highly distressed by psychopathological symptoms and were considered to be potentially in need of mental health care. From this follows a treatment rate of 20 %. Subjects with high mental stress consulted their GP's, internists, orthopedics and neurologists significantly more often than subjects with low mental stress. A considerable need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment facilities has to be faced. Besides the improvement of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment facilities, psychosocial networks should be established in order to provide an integrative and interdisciplinary approach to mental problems in the community.

Most of the respondents (61%) believed that bipolar disorder is just another term for the melting of the polar ice caps, only 4.6 % associated it with mental illness. The question arises as to whether it makes sense to use a diagnosis which the lay public associates with everything but a mental illness. Since it is impossible to erase the term bipolar disorder from the psychiatric terminology, it seems necessary to increasingly propagate this term among the lay public.

The relevant literature were identified by means of a computerized MEDLINE research on the years 1993 - 2004 and scanning of review articles. A content analysis of interviews with 32 caregivers about their emotional burdens was carried out to complete and elucidate the review. The emotional burden of caregivers are manifold. Following categories can be distinguished: anxiety and sorrows due to the lack of information about the illness and treatment, unsureness and overcharge with the symptoms of the illness, sorrows about the treatment of the patient, helplessness and palsy, loneliness and responsibility on his own, feelings of being excluded from the treatment of the patient, anxiety about the future, feelings of restrictions of the own autonomy and problems in demarcation, hope and disillusionment, grief and feelings of loss, fear of relapse and suicide, sense of shame and stigmatization, discouragement, feelings of guilt, anger and disappointment, changes in family roles and role-conflictions, problems in the sexuality of the partnership and anxiety about an illness of one's own or heredity to the children of one's own. The distinct knowledge of caregivers' emotional burdens can help to avoid overcharging the capacity of the carers, to decline high expressed-emotion-levels in the families and to reduce relapse rates of the patients.

The study was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Dresden University of Technology. A sample of 95 relatives was assessed at admission and after four weeks of treatment using the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), the period to be rated being the last four weeks prior to assessment. Relatives reported a mean level of burden, which for both settings decreased during the first four weeks of treatment. With respect to this period, burden on relatives of day hospital patients did not differ from that on relatives of inpatients. The relatives' mental well-being was markedly impaired, and only that of the inpatients' relatives did slightly improve during treatment. Treating acute mentally ill as day hospital patients does not result in greater burden on relatives compared to treating them as inpatients. Independently from treatment setting, relatives of psychiatric patients should be actively approached and offered information, coping strategies, and help. Further research should include qualitative methods. ","1390":"Self-immolation as reported in the literature usually happens in the context of suicide acts or political martyrdom. We report a case in which a patient during a first psychotic episode attempted to immolate herself: she covered her legs with pieces of clothing and set them a fire. Severe burning made amputation of both her legs necessary, one above, one below the knee. The patient had not acted in this way in order to die, but to save herself from the impending end of the world. She was convinced the earth was going to explode, and she would only be able to flee to Venus by self-immolation. She acted under the influence of imperative acoustic hallucinations encouraging her and pressing her to proceed. Antipsychotic treatment with clozapine resulted in complete remission of all psychotic symptoms. Other than during psychosis the patient didn't believe in life on other planets, had no fantasies about the end of the earth, no contact with sects and no religious or cultural motives for self-immolation.","1391":"By use of a 7-y-follow-up investigation of differences between geriatric psychiatric patients and their management in an integrated (with other adult age groups) care in the University Psychiatric Hospital (PUK) compared to those in a separated (only according to age) care in the Psychiatric State Hospital (LKH), which together treat all psychiatric inpatients in Goettingen, Germany, we wanted to show, whether progress can be made visible. We performed standardized chart reviews of randomly selected groups of patients, who had been treated in the PUK (n = 104) and the LKH (n = 100) in the years 1998 and 1999. Again, organic brain diseases\/dementia was the most frequent diagnosis in the LKH and depression that of the PUK. Less diagnostics were applied compared to the previous investigation, especially neuroimaging. Non-drug treatments are (documented) more frequently now in the LKH. Both institutions - data with respect to frequent syndromes are given - treated the wide majority of patients with psychoactive drugs, especially neuroleptics, typical antidepressants, benzodiazepines. Antidementia drugs were given significantly less. Hospital stays decrease in length. Compared to the respective investigation in Magdeburg there is some evidence supporting specialized care for the elderly. Budgetary restrictions could also be shown in inpatient treatment. Progress in specific drug treatment does not reach the patients as much as necessary.

Premedication showed a dramatic decrease of antidementia drug treatment and a nearly unchanged high rate of prescriptions of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. With a lower age and lower rate of specialist treatment we could not find signs of a better outpatient care preceding hospital admission during follow-up.

However, results of research on burden of caregivers indicate aspects of burden which do not seem to be associated with the patients' disorder. As part of a study on the burden of caregiving to mentally ill family members in-depth interviews as well as diary writing over a 12 weeks period were carried out with 6 spouses of patients suffering from schizophrenia or depression. Differences in the burden of caregiving do not seem to be related to the type of the patients' diagnosis. Aspects of partnership dominated the interviews and diary writing of the spouses. In all cases substantial parts of experienced burden are related to the spouses' efforts to share mastering of the illness with the patient. The hypothesis of specific aspects regarding the type of the patients' disorder related to spouses caregiver burden can not be supported by the results of this study. However, our results seem to encourage aspects of relationship within the development of support programs for relatives of mentally ill people.

We aim to clarify the concept of mental illness stigma and discuss important consequences for people with mental illness. A search of scientific literature on mental illness stigma was conducted with a focus on conceptually relevant empirical studies. After giving a conceptual overview of stigma, we elaborate on the consequences of stigma, focussing on self-stigma\/empowerment, coping behaviour, fear of stigma as a barrier to using health services, and on structural discrimination. Main strategies to reduce stigma -- protest, education, and contact -- are discussed. Stigma is of central importance to persons with mental illness, both to how they experience their illness and its consequences and whether they use available health services. Well-designed anti-stigma initiatives will help to diminish the impact of mental illness stigma.

Therefore, 23 patients with OCD were recruited among individuals seeking treatment at our university hospital outpatient clinic for anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders. All patients underwent a semistructured interview aimed at investigating their individual pathways to psychiatric care, to their experiences in the health system and to the first appearances of the psychiatric disorder. Those affected often trivialize and normalize the first symptoms of OCD. Also, in many cases, family members of OCD-patients do not understand the first symptoms of OCD. Contrary to patients with depression and anxiety disorder, OCD-patients often choose psychiatrists as their first professional contact. The first symptoms of the disorder must be diagnosed at an early stage in order to provide the patients with the acknowledged therapy for OCD.

Logistic regression analyses revealed significantly elevated odds ratios for alcohol-related disorders in men aged 31 to 45, 46 to 60, and 61 to 75 years (OR = 9.0, OR = 7.5, and OR = 10.7, respectively) and for Major Depression, single episode, in men and women aged 61 to 75 years (OR = 42.7 and OR = 15.9). In males aged 31 to 45 years polysubstance-related disorders (OR = 9.5) and in females aged 61 to 75 years cognitive and mental disorders due to a general medical condition (OR = 12.2) were significantly and independently associated with suicide. Alcohol-related disorders and Major Depression differently contribute to male and female suicide risk in special age groups. These findings imply differentiated prevention strategies.

A promising model is the Regional Budget for Mental Health Care, which is currently being examined in Schleswig-Holstein. The present paper describes first experiences with the new resource allocation model. BASIC CONDITIONS: An annual budget, provided for the treatment of a fixed number of patients, makes it possible to reduce inpatient capacity in favour of improved community-integrated approaches for the treatment of acute psychiatric illness. In a first step inpatient capacity will be reduced by 8 percent. By the end of 2007 capacity for hospital day care shall be increased by 87 percent and a home treatment will be implemented. The previous working method, orientated to treatment setting, will be replaced by an approach specialized in diagnostic groups. The Regional Budget could improve the continuity and flexibility of patient care. Service providers become motivated to treat in a way, which with little resource consumption achieves a long lasting health status improvement. For health insurances the Regional Budget is an opportunity to limit cost increases.

We investigate the cost-effectiveness of the AChE inhibitor Galantamine for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a German context. A Markov model as the decision theoretic framework is applied to compare two treatment scenarios (Placebo vs. Galantamine). The incremental cost-utility ratio based on different sources of data is calculated as decision criteria. In the base case, the application of the AChE inhibitor Galantamine is a dominant scenario with cost savings along with gained quality adjusted life years. It is not cost saving from the perspective of third party payers in Germany. Results are sensitive regarding assumptions about efficacy of the drug and mortality in the analysed cohort. The German reimbursement system places an obstacle to the application of Galantamine. Further research is needed to tackle uncertainties in the model. ","1411":"So far only five randomized controlled trials on acute day hospital care have assessed direct health care costs and compared these with costs of conventional inpatient treatment. This paper aims to close this research gap for German speaking countries. Another trial was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Dresden University of Technology. Using the Client Service Receipt Inventory interviews with patients at three time-points (admission, discharge, three months after discharge) assessed their utilization of health care services. Based on the results of a separate regional cost-calculation project, costs of individual care packages could be calculated. 144 patients (day care: n = 75, inpatient care: n = 69) with complete data sets for all time-points of assessment were included in the intention-to-treat-analysis. Means of direct costs (given in Euro and referred to Deutsche Mark prices in 2000) were computed, and t-tests and bootstrap-procedures were used for group comparison. Furthermore, missing and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Patients in the acute day hospital caused mean direct health care costs of 12 401 per person within the entire period assessed. Thus, their cost level falls below the mean costs of inpatient care (15,924 euro per person) by 22.1 %. Missing analyses showed no selection effects on cost results caused by patients who could not be assessed at all defined time-points. Costs for inpatient and day care services were the most sensitive parameters for maintaining the statistically significant differences of cost means demonstrated between the two study groups. For German-speaking countries, this study shows for the first time that acute day care -- which has been demonstrated to be clinically at least as effective as inpatient care - is the less expensive option if these two settings are comparatively assessed.

A survey of a representative sample (N = 3522) of the non-institutionalised population aged 18 and above in Germany was conducted using the EQ-5D, TTO and contingent valuation as well as the SF-12 questionnaire. Construct validity was analysed by comparing 130 respondents in whom 12-month prevalence for major depression, minor depression, or dystimia according to DSM-IV was identified based on a version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI) to respondents without depressive disorders. Concurrent validity was analysed by assessing the correlation between these measures in the group with depressive disorders. In the group with depressive disorders, problems in all EuroQol dimension except for mobility were significantly more frequent, and mean values of all analysed preference measures except for willingness-to-pay were less favourable than in the group without depressive disorders (EQ VAS score 67 vs. 78; EQ-5D index [VAS] 83 vs. 94; EQ-5D index [TTO] 0.81 vs. 0.91; TTO 0.89 vs. 0.95; always p &lt; 0.001). In the group with depressive disorders, EQ VAS score and EQ-5D indices were significantly correlated one with another (ranging from r = 0.63 to r = 0.92) as well as with the mental and the physical component scale of the SF-12 (ranging from r = 0.26 to r = 0.45) and with willingness-to-pay (ranging from r = - 0.20 to r = - 0.22); besides, willingness-to-pay was significantly correlated with TTO (r = - 0.46). The results of this study point to the construct validity and concurrent validity of preference measures in patients with depressive disorders. ","1413":"The purpose of this study was to estimate the direct costs of depression in Germany from the social perspective. The data came from the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD), in which a representative sample of 3555 non-institutionalised adults aged 18 years or older was interviewed in Germany. Using the most recent version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI), 131 persons with a 12-month prevalence of major depression, minor depression and dysthymia were identified. These patients reported their mental health care consumption of the last 12 months retrospectively, which was valued by prices of 2002. The average direct costs for treating depressive disorders were 686 EUR per patient and year. The total direct costs of depression in Germany was estimated at approximately 1.6 billion EUR. Because the sample was restricted to the non-institutionalised population, calculated costs may be underestimated.

Since these factors have been insufficiently controlled in most of the recent fMRT studies in particular on psychiatric disorders, results are often controversial. Using an intrapersonal study design and a standardized stimulation apparatus, we explored differential effects of typical and atypical neuroleptic treatment in schizophrenia. In addition to fMRT, 3D ultrasonic assisted motor analysis was used to investigate gait and hand movements.

In combination with genetic aspects, TMS is able to bridge the gap between molecular research and clinical approach.","1420":"Neurological signs and disturbed psychomotor performance are consistently confirmed by clinical studies on schizophrenic patients. They could either be caused by the illness itself or could occur as side-effects of antipsychotic medication. Based on the clinical observation, differential diagnosis between catatonic symptoms of schizophrenia and extrapyramidal side-effects often remains unclear. Apart from their diagnostic value, motor disturbances can also be predictive parameters for prognosis of the disease and clinical response to antipsychotic treatment. Motor disturbances are mainly assessed by use of clinical ratings. In the last years, new approaches like infrared or ultrasonic movement analysis systems have been introduced to objectively determine motor disturbances in schizophrenic patients. Ultrasonic movement analysis systems calculate the three-dimensional positions of tiny markers, which are attached to moving body parts, with high spatial and temporal resolution. Thus, key parameters of gait and hand-movements can be determined exactly. Results of several studies using these new methods indicate that schizophrenia causes a primary disturbance of motor performance. Treatment with conventional antipsychotics intensifies many of the disabling motor deficiencies, whereas the influence of atypical antipsychotics on motor performance is either not detectable or much smaller. All in all, most results of studies using objective methods for the assessment of motor performance underline the advantages of treatment with atypical antipsychotics compared to conventional antipsychotics, particularly with regard to the patient's motor performance.","1421":"There is a long tradition to develop valid instruments for the exact assessment of psycho-motor dysfunctions in psychiatry. However, progress is hampered by the complexity of emotionally driven movements in psychiatric patients. Methods used up to now either remains unspecific due to only qualitative measurements or focus on the neurophysiological aspects too much. Thus, the results accomplished so far are only very general unspecific concerning different groups of psychiatric patients. In this paper, two own methods are presented which are aimed to avoid the two poles above mentioned. Kinematic analyses of facial expressions as well as handwriting movements provide quantitative and quite specific informations about psycho-motor dysfunctions of psychiatric patients and the effects of psychotropic substances. Thus, these methods are well suitable for relating them to other neurobiological parameters in order to contribute to the pathophysiological understanding of psycho-motor symptoms in psychiatric patients.","1422":"Acute extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) are a common phenomenon of treatment with antipsychotics. They are associated with a substantial reduction of the patient's quality of life and of compliance with the treatment. This article gives an overview of the different forms of EPS. It outlines strategies to avoid these side-effects and discusses problems in diagnosis and treatment. In comparison to conventional compounds, the clearest advantage of new generation antipsychotics is a reduced risk of the occurrence of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS). Many studies have found that newer antipsychotics have a lesser propensity to causes EPS. Nevertheless, there are some conflicting results on this topic. This article discusses some of these results and sheds light on methodological problems in the evaluation of side-effects of antipsychotic treatment.","1423":"Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by mental, motor and behavioral symptoms. It occurs in up to 18 % of acute admissions and is most frequently associated with affective and psychotic disorders. It is also seen in dissociative disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, mental retardation and organic psychiatric disorders. Catatonic syndromes are impressive states that can be reliably and validly diagnosed both clinically and with psychometric measurements and they can be treated effectively. Despite this, they are often not recognized in clinical practice, are not part of the therapeutic strategy and thus remain untreated. The following article is intended to give a review of the most pertinent questions related to the diagnosis and treatment of catatonia in order to improve clinicians' ability to recognize and treat catatonic symptoms and syndromes adequately.","1424":"Motor disturbances are common symptoms in schizophrenia.

Analyses of current guidelines (using published guidelines for panic disorders) demonstrate that rehabilitative elements which are rated as important by the experts are only marginally mentioned in guidelines up to now.

Attitudes and preferences were in line with the state of the art as documented in the literature, with the exception of the fact that 30 % of the physicians favored a too brief therapeutic trial with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for agitation. According to the international literature the preferred treatment of psychotic symptoms in Parkinsons's disease is also a little bit different. Modern atypical antipsychotics, and particularly risperidone, were highly favored for agitation, delirium, psychotic symptoms, and rage outbursts; benzodiazepines (oxazepam and lorazepam), and to an extent also low-potency conventional antipsychotics, were favored only for brief ad hoc medication courses. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were preferentially treated with SSRI, with the exception of short-term therapy of generalized anxiety where benzodiazepines were favored.

During the observation period 1998 - 2000 the diagnostic distributions and the psychosocial base data of all patients admitted to the BKH Bayreuth with the clinical picture of a paranoid psychosis, were examined regarding an increase of drug-induced psychosis. Both the number of the treated patients with chronic dependence on methamphetamine as well as acute admissions of patients with drug-induced psychosis increased. Differences to patients diagnosed a schizophrenia could be shown. With the further increasing abuse of stimulants like methamphetamine the number of patients with induced psychosis will escalate.

The changing doctor-patient-relationship, the growing influence of user groups and consumer associations, the new model of patients as responsible partners and last not least the increasing financial pressure have resulted in patients being more often and more intensively involved in treatment decisions. This development has influenced psychiatry in general and psychiatric research. Concepts like quality of life and consumer satisfaction were taken up in Germany as well and have stimulated a lot of empirical studies. In addition to traditionally used outcome criteria like severity of disease and symptomatology so called subjective outcome criteria are more and more often applied. Using seven simple questions - why, what for, who, what, in what way, where, when - some general aspects concerning surveys of patient surveys are discussed. Some relevant results are outlined and the actual situation is evaluated. In general the described results of patient surveys refer to patients in hospitals. This can be explained by the structure of our health care system and by the fact that substantial research resources are generally linked to the inpatient sector. Results of inpatient surveys cannot be generalized to outpatients and users of complementary services. In the next years social psychiatric research should bring stronger focus to the subjective perspectives of these patients.","1445":"Changes in the provision of psychiatric services within the last decennials are probably best understood if the impact of national socialism on clinical psychiatry is regarded. Many psychiatrists took part in the \"Aktion T4\" the organised killing of their patients, at least they did not resist campaigns directed to killing or sterilisation patients. After WW II, a period of silence and acceptance of inhuman circumstances in the large mental state hospitals appeared, when in the sixties a new generation of psychiatrists was no longer willing to continue the traditional system of mental health care delivery. The Expert Commission on Mental Health Care reported a comprehensive agenda on reformation of service delivery in 1975, which was influential in the development of alternative structures of psychiatric services. Most mental state hospitals reduced their capacities and parallel to this process smaller units, devoted to principles of community psychiatry, associated to general hospitals were created. Overall, the number of hospital driven beds decreased at about 33 %, but in the large hospitals at two thirds within the last 25 years in Baden-Wurttemberg. This process of deinstitutionalization was accompanied by the development of structures for community care, internal reorganization and modernization, and important steps in budget development, which lead to better treatment opportunities for all kinds of psychiatric institutions. The concrete and historical reality of these circumstances and changes, and possible future directions are exemplified for the psychiatric hospital in Weinsberg.","1446":"The social implications and long term consequences of mental disorders regarding sick days at work, unemployment rates and early retirement are considerable. Outcome in psychiatric treatment should be measured not only by reduction of psychopathological symptoms and improvement of subjective well-being respectively quality of life but also by taking social integration into account. Job inclusion could become a crucial factor indicating successful therapy. It is remarkable that there has been so little focus on the links between reduction of psychopathological symptoms and competitive working skills. Hardly any studies exist evaluating for example psychopharmacological strategies referring to social outcome criteria. Without denying the progress that has been made, the classical paradigm of community psychiatry has reached its limits. Initial hopes of spontaneous social integration did not come true. Vocational rehabililitation sensu strictu is either aiming at the individual's work related skills (personal approach) or at reducing demands on the job (environmental approach) - in Germany being mostly realised at sheltered workshops. Thus most of the rehabilitation programmes are based on the traditional \"train and place\"-approach. There are some controlled studies about the new innovative supported employment programmes taking the reverse principle of \"place and train\" into account. These studies could show a clear superiority regarding the number of successfully integrated patients. Scientific evaluation of complex programmes is sophisticated but seems to be necessary for further developments in the field of general psychiatric therapies as well as for the legitimation of financial ressources needed. Foreseeing the perspective of social psychiatry a next substantial step could be the identification of social and functional outcome variables as a basis of validation of numerous therapy strategies.","1447":"In our society, people with mental illness are exposed to various forms of discrimination.

Finally, using the association \"Irrsinnig menschlich\" (\"Madly human\") in Leipzig as an example, approaches to reduce discrimination of mentally ill people will be presented.","1448":"Schizophrenia is a severe psychic disorder that occurs at young age and often leads to a work disability. The disease not only induces direct costs in the health care system but also indirect costs that show up in the social security system. In this study, we apply statistics from the social security administration on early retirement due to disability. Over 6000-males and females per year retire with the diagnosis schizophrenia (classified as 295, ICD-9). The average retirement age is 39 for males and 42 for females. Schizophrenia is the most important single reason for early retirement before age 40. Of all male cases of disability retirement under the age of 40, 14.7 % are due to schizophrenia. The present discounted value of pensions paid out before the standard retirement age of 65 is 215 000 Euro for an average male. Moreover, the revenue loss in income taxes and payroll contributions amounts to 345 000 Euro. In the year 2000, a total of 125 000 persons under the age of 65, who originally entered retirement with the diagnosis schizophrenia, are estimated to be receiving a pension. The corresponding annual expenditures of the social security system reach 1.3 Billion Euro; the revenue loss (pay-roll plus income taxes) reaches 2 Billion Euro. Since only two thirds of the working age population is covered by the social security system, the costs of early retirement due to schizophrenia are underestimated by a factor of at least one third.","1449":"The clinical relevance of drug-induced weight changes is due to the development of obesity, increased rates of morbidity and reduced treatment compliance, even if the psychopharmacological treatment is effective. Possible underlying causes of weight gain in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs are the psychiatric disorder itself, and changes in the neurotransmitter, cytokine and hormone systems. Clinical management of psychopharmacologically induced weight gain includes diet, behavioral and pharmacological therapy. Possible add-on strategies - based on case reports and small studies - are ephedrine, sibutramine, orlistat, topiramate, nizatidine, naltrexone, metformin, amantadine, and reboxetine.","1450":"Since the introduction of atypical antipsychotics success criteria of an effective antipsychotic treatment are more comprehensive. For instance these criteria include negative symptoms as well as cognitive deficits which are both important for the long-term prognosis of schizophrenia. However, the most fundamental change was the inclusion of the patients' perspective with respect to the treatment. Quality of life assessments as well as evaluation of subjective well-being are of increasing scientific interest and have been assessed in numerous studies. Accordingly there has been ascertained that schizophrenic patients are indeed able to fill out self reports consistently and reliably and it has been shown that patients' perspective differs enormously from the evaluation of psychiatrists with regard to antipsychotic treatment. In consideration of the variety of atypical antipsychotics and different resulting effects for compliance and prognosis of schizophrenia it seems needful to strengthen patients' perspective as an important success criterion of antipsychotic treatment.","1451":"A lot of progress has been made in the treatment of schizophrenia against hallucinations and delusions. However, Schizophrenia still remains a highly disabling disease causing tremendous deficits in social- and vocational functioning. Cognitive deficits are known since the early 90's as a further core feature of schizophrenia, and it has been shown that social- and vocational dysfunctions are closely related to neurocognitive deficits. Whether those findings bear a potential for therapeutic implications still needs to be shown. In this overview therapeutic interventions with respect to cognitive deficits and their effectiveness and their role for vocational rehabilitation will be summarized.","1452":"In contrast to the opinion that prevailed in the 1980es, there is now increasing evidence that the plasticity of the human brain, i. e. its remarkable ability to adapt to and change with experience, is, under normal conditions, a lifelong phenomenon. Representations of the environment are associated with activations and biochemical modifications in neuronal networks, which will be stabilized, modified or will wither in the course of cumulated experience. The capability to modify the biochemistry of synapses as well as the growth and change in terms of rewiring of synapses, dendritic branching and glial cell proliferation via the dialogue of synapses and genes, results in specific changes in neuronal connectivity and function. On the neurotransmitter level, glutamate and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) as well as dopamine and serotonin, but also endorphin and encephalin, have a key position in this context. These neurotransmitter systems modulate neuronal plasticity on the neuronal level; on the behavioural level they influence affect, emotion, positive motivation and the correct evaluation of environmental stimuli. Experience, action as well as learning and memory are influenced by these systems. A basic thesis of this paper is that these mechanisms are involved in neuronal plasticity and that learning and memory are thus not only used and reused in structuring the CNS during the initial establishment of connections in the immature brain, in lifelong memory consolidation or the rewiring after brain damage, but can also be used to mould experience, learning und behaviour during psychotherapy and rehabilitation in adults.","1453":"In recent years it has been possible to treat attention as an organ system with its own anatomy, circuitry and set of functions. We view attention in terms of three interrelated neural networks in the human brain. These networks carry out the specific functions of developing and maintaining the alert state, orienting to sensory input, and executive control. Damage to these networks or their chemical neuromodulators can produce specific neurological and psychiatric deficits. We have conducted behavioral, developmental, and patient studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), event related potentials (ERP), genetics, and computational modeling to investigate the anatomy, circuitry, pathology, and development of attentional networks. The Attentional Network Test (ANT) is developed to measure the efficiency of each of the attention networks. The ANT can also serve as an endophenotype for genetic studies on attentional networks. This paper reviews our work with the ANT in studies of normal performance and various forms of psychopathology.","1454":"Cognitive, mnestic, and emotional disturbances can occur in a wide range of psychiatric patients. Both neurochemical alterations as well as structural brain abnormalities can be neural correlates of neuropsychological dysfunctions in these patients. In this paper, we give an introduction to neuropsychological domains with a focus on different kinds of memory and executive functions. Thereafter, we describe neurocognitive deteriorations in patients with schizophrenia, depression, alcohol addiction, and Korsakoff's syndrome. Brain alterations affect primarily parts of the frontal lobe, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal and the orbitofrontal cortex. This can be seen in volume reduction, glucose hypometabolism, or dysfunctions of dopaminergic fronto-striatal loops. Furthermore, structural or functional changes of hippocampal formation, anterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, and different thalamic nuclei are also involved in neurocognitive disturbances of psychiatric patients.","1455":"Despite the compelling evidence for a strong heritability of schizophrenia, the aetiology and genetic underpinnings of this disabling disease still remain unclear. Reasonable explanations for current problems in identifying candidate genes for schizophrenia are the complexity of its genetic background as well as the heterogeneity of the clinical appearance of this disease. For a higher efficiency in genetic investigations, a new approach came up which defines clinically distinct traits much more precisely: the so called endophenotype concept. Schizophrenic patients suffer from marked cognitive deficits. These deficits are closely related to the neurobiological basis of the disease, exhibit a high negative impact on clinical outcome, and may serve as endophenotypes for genetic studies. Identification of neurocognitive endopenotypes is usually performed in terms of a combination of neuropsychological tests and neurophysiological measurements. Thus, future genetic investigations as well as psychosocial and psychopharmacological therapy strategies will focus on the severity and potential therapeutic modification of cognitive deficits in order to improve psychosocial reintegration of schizophrenic patients in the long-term.","1456":"There is compelling evidence from family, twin and adoption studies of a substantial genetic contribution to schizophrenia. The mode of transmission is complicated and very rarely if ever involves a single gene. Rather schizophrenia results from multiple genes of small effect and their interplay with the environment. Perhaps because the overall size of the genetic effect is large, accounting for about 80 % of variance, definite environmental factors have been difficult to pin down. It has even been suggested that \"the environment\" consists entirely of epigenetic or stochastic phenomena that can never be detected by a standard epidemiological methods. Nevertheless, a variety of social stressors, including high expressed emotion in relatives and life events affect the course of illness and certain physical factors such as obstetric complications and cannabis smoking have been implicated in contributing to liability to the disorder. The recent discovery of several positional candidate genes that have been replicated as being associated with liability to schizophrenia holds considerable promise not just for a better understanding of the neurobiology but also for improved knowledge about risk prediction and gene-environment interplay.","1457":"There will be an enormous change for general as well as social psychiatry in the next decade. With regard to schizophrenia it is apparent that only innovative research strategies and practical care together may be able to improve the clinical outcome of these disabled persons in the long term. Definitely, a modern social psychiatry does need a better understanding of different aspects of schizophrenia, which includes comprehensive knowledge about its ethiological genetic- and cognitive-based hypotheses as well as awareness of modern drug strategies and effective rehabilitation programs. Alike health economic aspects will reform social psychiatry as its own concepts have to prove their efficacy not only from a therapeutical view but also with respect to its short-, middle- and long-term cost effectiveness.","1458":"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been established at BKH Augsburg (psychiatric district hospital) since January 2001. According to Olanzapine product information the following illustration shows the evaluation (n = 216) of various parameters of the TDM requirements of Olanzapine. Items examined include \"classification according to diagnoses\", \"reason for requirement\", \"severity of disease\", \"therapeutic effect\" and \"side-effects\". In addition, serum concentration, daily dosage, clinical assessment (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), age, height and weight of patients will be presented. Clearly sick patients, 52 % of them between 20 and 30 years old, were less compliant and achieved only a moderate therapeutic effect. TDM is mainly assessed to control compliance. However, more specific and more personalized TDM would be more useful. ","1459":"The introduction of Ziprasidone stimulated discussion about frequency and importance of QTc-interval prolongations with antipsychotic therapy. In an open non-randomized study we collected data about QTc-interval, electrolytes, vital parameters and associated clinical symptoms in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. 33 patients were scanned and some moderate QTc-interval prolongations but no clinical events were seen. Due to scarcity of such events existing data should be completed by large scale clinical studies and by registration of severe QTc-interval prolongations and torsades de pointes in central drug monitoring systems.","1460":"The results concerning therapeutic drug monitoring of Quetiapin concentration in 152 in-patients will be presented. In addition to measuring the serum concentration of Quetiapin standardized patient data were collected and the clinical history assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). A significant positive correlation of the serum concentration and the daily dosage was found. Co-medication with the CYP 3A4 inhibitor Nefazodon was associated with an increase in the serum concentration without any adverse interactions occurring. While a correlation of dosage and effect could be shown with Quetiapin, inter- and intraindividual differences could be observed. Drug monitoring therefore seems useful in clinical setting and is recommended. ","1461":"In the treatment of affective and schizophrenic psychosis, modern atypical antipsychotic agents and newer antidepressive agents recently have increasingly been used. In this prospective naturalistic study, patients were examined who had previously been treated psychopharmaceutically for a schizophrenic (n = 52) or depressive (n = 38) disorder and were readmitted in a psychiatric emergency clinic. While Serum levels were examined major interest was to find out similarities or differences in the drug compliance of schizophrenic and depressive patients before rehospitalization.","1462":"Isolation and tranquillization are often said to be the main concerns of psychiatric nursing homes. However, little is known about nowadays daily practice. The aim of our study was to investigate the present mode of psychopharmacological treatment in nursing homes serviced by our psychiatric ambulance. For that purpose, a standardized questionnaire was applied. There was slight trend in favour of atypical antipsychotics (49 %) as opposed to conventional neuroleptics (46 %). In 18 % of the patients, a combination of both atypical and conventional antipsychotics was administered, while only in 5% two or more conventional neuroleptics were given at the same time. Taken together, we could assure a modern psychopharmacotherapy trying to optimize the individual level of cognitive and psychosocial functioning.","1463":"We investigated as to whether dosedependent extrapyramidal tolerance of Flupentixol decanoate is inferior to that of Risperidone. 143 Risperidone and 177 Flupentixol decanoate treated patients were consecutively entered into this non - randomized open study and assessed with the Simpson-Angus-Scale regarding presence of rigor. Treatment comparisons of rigor frequency was done by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The risk of rigor increased with dose on both treatments. EPMS-risk was not increased under treatment with Flupentixol decanoate (mean dose 35.06 +\/- 19.7 mg\/2 weeks) compared to Risperidone (mean daily dose: 5.2 +\/- 2.5 mg\/kg) when comparable weight standardized Haloperidol equivalence doses (WHE) were used. This study offers limited evidence for methodological reasons. Yet, results do not support the view that EPS are more frequent on Flupentixol decanoate than on Risperidone when doses are comparable. ","1464":"Schizophrenic disorders as well as neuroleptic treatment can affect locomotion. The study assessed the influence of neuroleptic treatment on externally triggered gait on a treadmill at three different velocities via ultrasonic topometric gait analysis. Spatial and temporal gait parameters were assessed in two groups of schizophrenic patients either under treatment with conventional neuroleptics (n = 12) or without neuroleptic treatment (n = 10) and re-assessed after treatment change to the atypical neuroleptic olanzapine in a repeated measures design. After switch from conventional neuroleptics to olanzapine patients showed an increase of step length and decrease of cadence at the low (p &lt;\/= 0.01) and the intermediately low treadmill velocity (p &lt;\/= 0.05), whereas the parameters remained stable at the normal gait velocity. Significant differences between the untreated state and treatment with olanzapine were not detectable. We conclude that conventional neuroleptic treatment impairs the regulation of gait parameters and that this effect can be reversed at slow gait velocities by external stimulation via treadmill walking.","1465":"Although there were multiple initiatives to modify course and outcome of schizophrenia by optimizing present psychopharmacologic strategies many unsolved problems still exist. There is no doubt that first generation antipsychotics reduce positive symptoms of psychosis but the impact on negative symptoms or disturbances of affect or cognition remains very poor. In contrast second generation antipsychotics show significantly a better tolerability, especially less extrapyramidal side effects. However, they may initiate strong individual side effects. This article reflects advantages and disadvantages of modern antipsychotics on the course of schizophrenia.","1466":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of antipsychotics on memory functions in schizophrenic patients under clinical routine conditions. Schizophrenic patients (n = 111) before discharge to outpatient treatment were evaluated on verbal memory function. Data were analyzed according to pharmacological treatment controlling for age. We observed that treatment with atypical antipsychotics (n = 80) compared with conventional neuroleptics (n = 31) was significantly associated with a more favorable effect on memory function. In short-term- and working-memory and retention a clear advantage of atypical antipsychotics could be seen. Results from this study suggest that even under clinical routine conditions atypical antipsychotics have an advantage on memory function when compared with conventional antipsychotics. ","1467":"The diurnal variation of pain threshold was studied in 13 healthy volunteers (age: 21 - 27 ys) using the tourniquet pain model. A tourniquet was inflated above systolic blood pressure for 1 minute and pain scores and heart rate were recorded at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 minutes. The test was repeated during a study day at 6.00 h, 12.00 h, 18.00 h and 24.00 h. Significant differences of pain scores between clocktimes were found 1 minutes after inflation and after 1.5 minutes with regard to heart rate. Generally, the highest pain scores were found at 24.00 h.","1468":"The present study utilised the PC-interactive pressure algesimetry to quantify cervical pain after whiplash injury. Pressure painfulness of the splenius and trapezius muscles was investigated in patients with an acute cervical syndrome after whiplash injury and compared to that of healthy subjects. Pressure painfulness of neck and shoulder muscles was significantly increased in whiplash patients. The trapezius muscles were more painful left than right, probably due to the seat belt position. The computer-interactive pressure algesimetry enables a standardised, rater-independent quantification of cervical pain due to whiplash injury. ","1469":"To identify a possible relationship between the non-surgical treatment regimen and outcome. In a sample of 170 patients with sciatica due to a herniated disk the intensity of a conservative multimodal inpatient treatment in a neurological department was extracted. The outcome was examined using two prospective cohorts (183 patients). These results were compared with published data from orthopaedic inpatient rehabilitation in Germany. The neurological inpatient treatment regimen was more intense than the orthopaedic inpatient rehabilitation, especially with regard to physiotherapy. In contrast, physical therapy was applied more often in orthopaedic rehabilitation. A better short-term outcome with regard to pain intensity was found after multimodal conservative treatment. Further studies are needed to compare different treatment regimens in patients with sciatica. ","1470":"The antiepileptic carbamazepine can reduce aggressive behaviour and can be used as a mood stabilizer. We present a case report of a patient suffering from borderline personality disorder who was treated with carbamazepine and developed erythema multiforme.","1471":"In this case-study the case of a 76-year old white male with the diagnosis of beginning dementia and psychotic symptoms, who ingested 200 mg of diphenhydramin in suicidal intention, is presented. After a 3 days period in an internal medicine ward, in which he showed only mild anticholinergic symptoms, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric hospital. Here he showed more severe anticholinergic symptoms, including EEG-changes, for a prolonged period of two weeks time. This case helps to show the relevance of closer observation and EEG-controls in gerontopsychiatric patients even after the ingestion of a comparatively low dose of antihistaminics.","1472":"Ziprasidone, a novel antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, undergoes partial metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4. It is associated with moderate prolongation of QT interval, but no increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmia or sudden death was demonstrated. A 70-year-old male was initiated on quetiapine therapy for an acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia. The baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal QT interval (QTc: 417 ms). In combination therapy of quetiapine and ziprasidone the patient developed suddenly cardiac arrhythmia with extrasystoles and the ECG revealed a prolonged QTc interval of 482 ms. After breaking off treatment with quetiapine and reduction of ziprasidone a normalized QT interval (QTc: 428 ms) was measured. We suppose a potential of pharmacokinetic interaction between quetiapine and ziprasidone because of the same metabolic pathway by CYP3A4. Combining treatment of quetiapine and ziprasidone is therefore contraindicated. In addition we suggest caution using ziprasidone with any potential 3A4 substrate or inhibitor. ","1473":"A 29-year old had been admitted to our institution with acute onset of schizophreniform psychosis after 5-day administration of sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride, which had been prescribed for nicotine withdrawal in a daily dosage of 300 mg. Examination results were found to be completely normal, apart from a positive drug screen for cannabis. We hypothesize that bupropion had induced psychotic symptoms in this patient.","1474":"A case study on the clinical picture of frontotemporal dementia and the differential diagnostic problems will be described.","1475":"This is the rare case of a woman first diagnosed with Huntington's disease at the age of 86. She was first seen at our hospital in 1999 for evaluation of dementia. Prior to her hospitalization, she had been treated with Melperone for restlessness. There was no essential psychopathology other than mild dementia (MMSE 21). A neurological work-up identified generalized involuntary movements and genetic testing revealed 40 CAG repeats. Over the course of the next several years, the patient began to exhibit the full range of symptoms associated with Huntington's disease, such as severe involuntary movements and progressive dementia. In the end, she was bed-ridden and only able to utter a few unintelligible words and she succumbed to an infection in 2003 at the age of 89, almost 4 years after her initial diagnosis of Huntington's disease. This case points to the need to consider Huntington's disease as a differential diagnosis even when evaluating the geropsychiatric population. It is particularly important to isolate involuntary movements which cannot be attributed to tardive dyskinesia in those who have been treated with neuroleptics in the past.","1476":"The curriculum of a group for parents of children with ADHD and its evaluation by the participants are presented. A questionnaire was sent to the participants and answered anonymously. With a response rate of 59 %, mainly positive ratings were obtained. Information on the nature of the disorder, on behavioural strategies and the mutual exchange with other parents and the therapists were considered especially helpful. Information on ADHD, behavioural interventions and the exchange among co-parents contribute substantially to the success of a parent training group. ","1477":"Children with SDLD have a high risk of psychiatric disorder. For early intervention training of the parents in structured small groups is recommended. The aim of this pilot project is the development of a program for parents of german speaking children and the assessment of the acceptability by the parents. The selected topics for the parent training were grouped in six moduls. The joint analysis of short videosequences of interactions were used as a mean medium. The acceptability was assessed by questionaires. In three groups with 4 - 8 participants so far completed the feedback was positive. The structured training of parents is an acceptable form also for german parents. ","1478":"A slightly modified version of the basic documentation of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Associations is used to record in a standardised way important characteristics of the patients consulting clinics in Munich and Regensburg. The focus of the instrument is on the diagnostic classification of the symptoms according to the multiaxial classification scheme. The data of 5166 patients were analysed for frequency and type of combined psychiatric disorder. The results showed, that more than 60 % of the patients had more than one psychiatric diagnosis. The type of the comorbid disorders are discussed.","1479":"Providing support for caregivers plays an important role in the day hospital treatment concept. Protocols (during 15 months) of support groups for caregivers of patients with dementia and depression are identifying main causes of caregivers' burden and distress, as well as their expectations regarding day hospital treatment. Aims of the interventions were to support caregivers' positive self-concept and social competence, to inform and to train problem-solving strategies and to develop individual care arrangements. Close cooperation between the day hospital and the community based services is essential for overall positive treatment outcomes, for integrated care arrangements after discharge and to ease the burden of family caregivers.","1480":"Caregiver counselling is an indispensable feature of current concepts for dementia treatment. Self-support groups and psychoeducative programms for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease may reduce the burden of nursing and psychological strain. Specific caregiver needs from patients with frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD [frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, progressive aphasia, corticobasal degeneration]) are only partially taken into account. We conducted a German wide epidemiologic study which revealed that specific counselling for supporting relatives and caregivers of patients with FTLD is only fragmentary in hospital services for old age psychiatry. In most cases, they are referred to the local Alzheimer's disease Associations (89 %). Besides that, the existence of large hospital care units has significant negative repercussions on psychosocial supply for caregivers of patients with FTLD. To establish decentralized support units by these hospitals would lead to a significant improvement of medical and social care in this field.","1481":"Relatives expectations and satisfaction of psychiatric in-patients referring the psychiatric institution should have been explored. A questionnaire, based upon a content analysis of interviews with relatives (n = 32) about their expectations and satisfaction of psychiatric in-patient care was developed and sent to 139 relatives. The response rate was 41.7 % (n = 58). Nine of the ten most important expectations of the relatives et all refer to the successful and individual treatment of the patient. Referring their own person, relatives expect mostly an understandable and sincere enlightenment and information about the illness and therapy of the patient. Consumer-orientated treatment could help to make the treatment of the patient and consolidation accounting of the relatives more efficient and effective. ","1482":"The effects of mental illness on the quality of life of relatives were assessed with the SF-36 (Short Form-36 Health Survey). 304 relatives of 360 patients answered the SF-36 at hospital admission. The participant's data (age and gender) were randomizedly paired to data records of the German standard population. Relatives of mentally ill people judged their quality of life, especially their emotional well-being, significantly worse than the standard population. Female relatives estimated themselves as more burdened than male. By the means of SF-36 we could show that the quality of life in relatives of mentally ill people is clearly reduced especially in regard of social and psychical ranges. ","1483":"Nearly 50 % of subjects with continuing symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adulthood show a comorbid substance use disorder. Both, ADHD and alcohol dependence have a high genetic load and might even share overlapping sources of genetic liability. We investigated phenotype and 5-HTT\/5-HT2c allelic characteristics in 314 alcoholics of German descent. 21 % of the alcoholics fulfilled DSM-IV-criteria of ADHD with ongoing symptoms in adulthood. There was no significant difference in 5-HTT- or 5-HT2c-allele distribution between alcoholics and matched controls or between alcoholics with or without ADHD. In our sample the functional relevant 5-HTT-promoter and the 5-HT2c-receptor Cys23Ser polymorphism do not contribute to the supposed common genetic predisposition of ADHD and alcohol dependence. ","1484":"Comparison of buprenorphine vs. methadone to determine which medication is better for the detoxification of young opioid addicts. 93 consecutive opioid-dependent patients (ICD-10) from an in-patient detoxification unit for adolescents were investigated, of which 42 chose buprenorphine and 51 chose methadone for detoxification. Both groups did not differ with regard to different sociodemographic and addiction-specific variables such as age, gender, initiation of drug consumption and duration of opioid intake. 23.5 % of the methadone patients and 38.1 % of the buprenorphine patients finished detoxification successfully, in addition the buprenorphine patients finished detoxification 1.62 days earlier. There was no significant difference concerning these items. Buprenorphine seems to be at least as effective as methadone for opioid withdrawal in young addicts. ","1485":"Attachment theory yields empirical constructs for development of human self, personality and cognition. Insecure attachment strategies were associated with various psychiatric disorders. We investigated distribution of attachment styles in 368 adult alcoholics of German descent with or without persistent symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in 402 healthy individuals. Insecure attachment styles were significantly overrepresented compared to healthy controls. The subgroup of alcoholics with ADHD showed significantly more frequent enmeshed (74.1 %), the subgroup of alcoholics without persistent ADH-associated symptoms showed more frequent dismissing (35 %) attachment strategies. In our sample, insecure attachment styles are associated with alcoholism. The subgroup of alcoholics with persistent ADHD shows a specific attachment behavior that could contribute to different therapy response or to early onset or severity of alcoholism. ","1486":"The estimated prevalence for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adulthood is 2 - 6 %. Patients with a substance use disorder met the criteria for ADHD between 30 and 50 %. ADHD and conduct disorders are discussed to increase risk of developing substance abuse and increase severity of disorder. We compared epidemiological and clinical characteristics and comorbidity in subgroups of 314 adult alcoholics of German descent with or without persistent symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Aim of the study was to identify specific pathophysiological mechanisms that could contribute to vulnerability, severity or complication of alcohol dependence. 21.3 % of the alcoholics fulfilled DSM-IV-criteria of ADHD with ongoing symptoms in adulthood and had a Wender-Utah-Rating-Scale score &gt; 90. Subgroup of alcoholics with ADHD were significantly younger at age of onset of alcoholism (24 years versus 30 years), had a significantly higher daily alcohol intake (253 g versus 196 g EtOH), had significantly more social stress, lifetime experiences in court proceedings against them (11 versus 2 %) and suicidal ideation (25 versus 11 %). In the subgroup of alcoholics with ADHD 51 % fulfilled criteria of antisocial personality disorder. The early onset of alcoholism was most pronounced in this subgroup. In our sample, persistence of ADHD symptoms from childhood into adulthood and antisocial personality disorder contributes to vulnerability and morbidity of alcohol dependence with early onset and greater severity of disorder. ","1487":"For the planning of further substance abuse prevention programs it is necessary to obtain data about the patterns of region-specific substance use in adolescents. In 2002 a questionnaire survey on substance use among the 9 (th) graders of all school types in the city and in the county of Regensburg was carried out (mean age 15,3 years, N = 1580). The first substance ever used by adolescents are cigarettes, starting at an average age of 12.2 years. 30 % of the students are current daily smokers with 43 % fulfilling criteria of nicotine dependence. When used several times per week 53 % regard the use of spirits being very dangerous, whereas the same rate considers the danger of drinking wine or beer at the same frequency being rather small. The level of information about institutions offering help for substance abuse and dependence problems is being considered as poor or zero by 67 %. The primary prevention of smoking as early as possible should be a priority of school-based prevention programs. The study also reveals a deficit of information on substances and institutions offering help for substance abuse and dependence problems which should be faced in school lessons. ","1488":"In our paper we report about drug mortality in Bavaria in the years 1990 up to 2002, using statistical trend tests (Spearman rho, Kendall tau). We observed an increase of deaths by illegal drugs in Bavaria as whole, on the other hand also decreases in different parts of the country. ","1489":"This study aimed to examine performance improvement and compliance of schizophrenic patients participating in computerbased cognitive training with X-Cog(R). 20 patients (5 women, 15 men) with the diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD10 F20.X) were trained ten weeks (twice a week, duration 1h) using the software X-Cog(R) in different wards of the Bezirksklinikum Regensburg. After the evaluation of the feedback given by the computer it could be demonstrated that the patients showed marked practice improvements. Moreover it appeared very less leisure hours what could be shown by an evaluation of the regularity of participation. This study gives first indications that X-Cog(R) could be a useful way to increase individual performance, motivation and especially the continuity of participation in a therapy of schizophrenic patients training using a computerbased cognitive training software.","1490":"The installation of a discharge preparation group on a psychiatric ward for acutely ill patients shall enable the patient to reflect on their situation of life after the discharge from the hospital, to recognize individual problems and resources and, using multi professional help, to work out suitable ways and means to solve their problems. The participating patients rated this therapeutic offer in the whole as positive, especially because it related to their every-day-lives. This group led to a greater satisfaction of the patients and helped to prepare a more structured way of discharge from the hospital.","1491":"Results of latest neurobiological trauma-research suggest that many psychic disorders like personality disorders with complex traumatisation in patient's history and co-morbidities should better be treated as posttraumatic disorders. This is important for any therapy planning: should a modified psychoanalytic approach (like TFP by Kernberg) with emphasis on interpreting the transference-relation be preferred for patients with Borderline personality disorder or - diagnosing the same patients as complex posttraumatic stress disorder - a phase oriented trauma-specific approach. As such PITT combines psychodynamic understanding with hypnotherapeutic and imaginative methods. Crucial points are an active and supporting therapeutic relation, safety and reduction of stress, focus on all individual resources and use of imaginative ways for stabilization and later trauma-confrontation work.","1492":"Inpatients of \"psychotherapeutic treatment units\" at State Mental Hospitals in Bavaria are different from those treated in so-called psychosomatic clinics for rehabilitation, looking at additional criteria like psychiatric and somatic comorbidity or suicidal behaviour. Treatment concepts and results are respectable and comparable to so-called psychosomatic clinic. In this paper we describe the \"Psychotherapy Unit\" at the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Bayreuth. Depressive episode is the most diagnosis, with 1 to 4 comorbid psychiatric diagnosis in 82 % of all patients and 28 % with somatic comorbidity. ","1493":"Data about patients with personality disorders treated in specialized psychotherapy units in bavarian psychiatric hospitals during the second half-year 2001 (n = 256) were collected by a questionnaire. Diagnostic, therapeutic and social characteristics were registered. Treatment possibilities of the psychotherapeutic units und special qualifications of the staff were investigated as well. - The investigated population of personality disorders is mentally seriously handicapped has high rates of suicide-attempts and co-morbidity with other mental disorders. The units for psychotherapy offer a wide range of different psychotherapeutic treatments. The staff is well trained in psychotherapeutic qualifications. These results show, that bavarian psychiatric hospitals play an important role in psychotherapeutic treatment of severely ill in-patients. ","1494":"Up to now psychotherapeutic treatment naturally is part of treatment strategies of mental hospitals and departments of psychiatry at general hospitals. Actually there is a controversial debate in this issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the development of the utilization of these hospitals by patients with \"psychogenic disorders\" in the new federal states of eastern Germany. We studied the changes in the utilization in hospitals of psychiatry and psychotherapy in Thuringia 1993 up to 1999 by patients with ICD-9-diagnoses 300 - 1 and 306 - 9 and compared these data with these of other clinics in East und West Germany. The utilization of psychotherapy patients increased in all hospitals. The increase in Thuringia was highest, in the other eastern German it was higher as in western clinics. Reasons of admissions for in-patient psychotherapeutic treatment were suicide ideations and attempts, aggression against others and prepsychotic agitation. These results can be seen as a sign of a similar necessity of this care in the eastern as in western population under similar psychosocial conditions. ","1495":"In this paper we report about the situation of psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment in Bavarian state mental hospitals, based on data coming from surveys in those hospitals. 22 State mental hospitals in Bavaria have 1217 beds for acute psychotherapy, proofed on the basis of quality criteria. More than 50 per cent of all psychotherapy beds are located in those hospitals. ","1496":"To describe differences in cerebral glucose metabolism between frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 14 patients with FTLD (7 f\/7 m, mean age 60.1 years) and 14 patients with AD (7 f\/7 m, mean age 59.5 years) were examined. [18F]FDG positron emission tomography (PET) scans were analysed with statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). Significant decreases in glucose metabolism in FTLD compared to AD were detected in the left insula\/left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodman area [BA]13, 45 and 47) and in the medial frontal gyrus bilaterally (BA10). A significant decrease in AD compared to FTLD was identified in the right middle temporal gyrus (BA39). Cerebral PET could be a promising tool to discriminate FTLD from AD. ","1497":"The influence of emotional contents on brain activation was examined using functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRT). Aquiring 100 EPI-measurements of the whole brain, series of positive and negative pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) were shown to eight depressed males and to healthy controls. In depression, there was an overactivation in hippocampal area during positive stimulation, whereas an overactivation of amygdala, orbital and prefrontal regions was seen during negative stimulation. These results emphasize the importance of functional interaction between the neural network associated with emotion. We could show that depression is connected to dysregulation and disturbed functional connectivity during emotional processing. ","1498":"Functional MRI was used to test the effects of the deficient emotional responsiveness of psychopathic patients on cognitive processes. We used a Simon-paradigm, in which ten healthy volunteers and ten patients with a diagnosis of \"psychopathy\" (defined by Hare Psychopathy Checklist Revised) have to select their spatially defined responses on the basis of a nonspatial stimuli feature. For the emotion induction pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) were selected. At the beginning and intermediated by the Simon-paradigm blocks of positive, negative or neutral pictures were presented. Patients with \"psychopathy\" exhibited untypical activation patterns in amygdala and prefrontal regions during interferences between negative or positive stimulations and cognitive tasks. These results demonstrated disturbed regulation of emotion-cognition-interaction in \"psychopathy\" according to PCL-R. ","1499":"In the present study, functional neuroanatomy of the frontal lobe and limbic system could be uncovered as emotion processing neural substrates. fMRI was used to test the influence of induced emotions on a non-affective, attention-demanding, cognitive task. 6 Psychopaths versus 7 controls were analyzed by fMRI with a simon-paradigm after emotion induction. Emotion induction differentially influenced cortical activation patterns in emotion related brain areas like the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex. Structural-morphological neural areas of emotion regulation in \"psychopathy\" show variant activation patterns in fMRI. The neural basis of emotional impairment could be a dysfunctional medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. ","1500":"In the present study, functional fMRI was used to test the influence of induced emotions on a non-affective, attention-demanding, cognitive task. Twelve healthy males viewed blocks of affective pictures. Between picture presentation a Simon-paradigm was presented. In an alternating way blocks with stimulus-response compatible and incompatible trials were presented. Emotion induction differentially influenced cortical activation patterns. In negative mood incompatible trials in contrast to compatible trials lead to significant decrease of activity in emotion related brain areas like the amygdala, the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. These results support the hypothesis that negative emotions increase the information processing load and drain attentional resources. To compensate these effects emotion related brain areas must attenuate their activity. ","1501":"We describe the kindred of Alois Alzheimer's second patient, who died from plaque-only Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 1910. There is a neuropathologically defined subtype of AD without or only few tangles. This plaque-only form is found in about 6 % of autopsied cases of AD. We recruited of AD patients with age of onset before 70 years from the Rottal-Inn and Passau counties in Bavaria and extended a kindred with familial dementia using genealogies deduced from historic parish records. 1247 individuals were documented genealogically. In the maternal branch of the kindred we documented 40 deceased individuals with possible Alzheimer's disease, whereas other branches of the family had no suspicious entries. We conclude, that there is a familial predisposition to dementia with variable age of onset between 36 and 80 years of age in the kindred of Johann F.","1502":"Catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) plays a major role in dopamine metabolism and has been the object of extensive investigations in subjects affected by schizophrenia. Interest in the enzyme has grown in recent years following positive linkage findings for schizophrenia in the chromosomal region surrounding the COMT gene locus on 22q. In several studies, a gender-specific association of COMT polymorphisms with schizophrenia has been reported and has given rise to speculations on transmission ratio distortions. The present investigation addressed allelic distributions in 307 men and women with respect to the rs165599 A &gt; G polymorphism. No evidence was obtained for gender bias in allelic patterns, nor did we observe association with schizophrenia (p = 0.4). While studies involving same-sex siblings are lacking, gender-specific sharing of alleles does not appear to be a consistent feature of the COMT variant investigated.","1503":"[corrected] To evaluate tau-associated genetic polymorphisms in patients with sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and healthy control subjects. Tau-gene sequence of 30 patients with FTD and 30 healthy controls was analysed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR). Subsequent sequencing was performed to identify exonic and intronic differences between both groups. The following polypmorphisms, which are localized closely to each exon-intron-border, have been identified: In 37 % (n = 11) of the control subjects three different intronic polymorphisms occur simultaneously (Intron 2, 263, C --&gt; Y; Intron 3, 590, A --&gt; R; Intron 11, 150, G --&gt; A). In the FTD group, this coexistance has been observed only in 17 % (n = 5). In how far there exists a significant correlation between the newly identified triple polymorphism in the Tau gene and an alternated risk for FTD must be evaluated in a lager population. The proximity of these polymorphisms to the exon-intron border would facilitate functional influences on gene expression patterns. These preliminary results described, above potentially point to further pathogenetic factors in the genesis of FTD. ","1504":"Clinical, neurophysiological and neuroimaging data suggest that chronic tinnitus resembles neuropsychiatric syndromes characterised by focal brain activation. Low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as an efficient method in treating brain hyperexcitability disorders. Patients suffering from chronic tinnitus underwent a [ (18)F]deoxyglucose-PET (positron emission tomography). Fusioning of the individual PET scan with the structural MRI-scan (magnetic resonance imaging, T1, MPRAGE) revealed an increased metabolic activation in the primary auditory cortex as target point for rTMS. A neuronavigational system enabled the positioning of the figure of eight coil in relation to the target area. rTMS (110 % motor threshold; 1 Hz; 2000 stimuli\/day over 5 days) was performed using a placebo controlled cross-over design. Following active rTMS there was a moderate improvement of tinnitus perception. Treatment effects lasted up to six months in some patients. Neuronavigated rTMS offers new possibilities in the understanding and treatment of chronic tinnitus. ","1505":"An overview on neurobiological findings of violence is given: We present 1. neurochemical findings, 2. genetical aspects, 3. neuroanatomical correlates and 4. a functional network of violence. Even if specific neurobiological findings have not been found, impulsive violence is closely linked to serotonergic function and to several brain regions: orbitofrontal cortex, temporale lobe, amygdala. Knowing that violence has multifactorial determinants, a model on the neurobiological findings on violence is given. Thus, neurobiology is just an important part of conditions correlated with violence.","1506":"An enhanced ipsilateral motor potential after prefrontal TBI is known. Our aim was to examine, whether this contributes to movement initiation or execution. EEGs of 22 patients and 28 healthy controls were recorded. Subjects performed self-initiated movements of their right index finger. From the resulting movement-related potentials difference curves of corresponding left and right hemispheric electrodes were calculated. We observed significantly reduced difference curves at parietal electrodes P3 - P4 in the patient group during movement execution, but not at movement initiation. Our results point to compensatorily enhanced monitoring processes during movement execution following TBI. This is provided by enhanced activity of the ipsilateral postrolandic cortex, leading to the reduced preponderance observed in the present study. ","1507":"Disturbed GABA-B mediated inhibitory cortical processes are discussed to be involved both in schizophrenia as well as in chronic tinnitus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides an intriguing in vivo method to investigate GABA-B associated aspects of cortical inhibition, thus allowing to detect disease-related cortical inhibitory processes. Parameters of cortical excitability were measured by TMS in drug-naive first-episode schizophrenic patients and in patients suffering from chronic tinnitus. The cortical silent period as measured by TMS indicated a dysfunctional GABA-B mediated cortical inhibition in both groups of patients. TMS offers new insights into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Parameters of this technique point to changes in GABA-B associated inhibitory processes within thalamocortial circuits both in schizophrenia and chronic tinnitus. These data are in line with current models of disturbed thalamic gating in phantom perceptions like auditory hallucinations, chronic tinnitus and central pain. ","1508":"Causes and pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders is poorly understood. Infections by viruses or other agents may disturb neurotransmitters and elicit behavioral abnormalities, and induce long lasting immune reactions, referred to as mild encephalitis (ME). New findings (pathology, biochemistry, imaging) in schizophrenia and bipolar psychoses are compatible with ME hypothesis. In Chorea Sydenham and PANDAS syndrome autoimmune ME seems to explain anxiety-compulsive-hyperactivity symptoms. Add-on-therapy with Cox-II-blockers or valacyclovir improved acute schizophrenia, CSF filtration some cases of therapy resistant psychoses.","1509":"This research examines how successful recommended longterm medical treatment of schizophrenic patients is following their discharge from inpatient treatment by evaluating the yearly rehospitalization rates. The sample consisted of 76 patients with schizophrenia who were admitted for the first time into Bezirkskrankenhaus Augsburg within a year. The recommended long-term medical treatment with conventional or atypical antipsychotics of patients after discharge and the one year rehospitalization rate depending on the medical treatment at time of discharge were examined. After discharge from hospital more than 50 % of the observed patients were treated with atypical antipsychotics like olanzapine, risperidone or amisupride. Only 9 % were discharged with conventional neuroleptics. 38 % of the 76 observed patients had to be readmitted. This research shows that the beneficial properties of modern atypical antipsychotics are less favourable on a lower rehospitalization rate than expected. ","1510":"Predicting the job performance of schizophrenic patients after discharge from hospital has been the focus of many studies within the last 30 years. In our own long-term study, we have started to follow-up 49 consecutively admitted schizophrenics taking their individual return on the so-called first employment market as primary target variable. To evaluate the respective predictive power, a set of different neuropsychological, psychopathological and psychosocial parameters was gathered in each patient. The data presented here are based on our first follow-up 18 months after discharge. In concordance with present literature, statistical analysis revealed the following variables to be of decisive significance for successful occupational reintegration: - presence vs. absence of negative symptoms; - subjective ratings by interviewer; - baseline of both psychiatric treatment and working tenure. A combination of these parameters provides a useful tool to assess prospectively the individual job performance of a given patient. ","1511":"The aim of this study is to investigate, whether conventionally used questionnaires can differentiate between depressive patients. 52 depressive patients were investigated by self-assessment-scales and non-self-assessment-scales at time of admission, discharge and one year after discharge. The patients were subdivided in a \"remitted\" (n = 34) and a \"non-remitted\" (n = 18) group by criteria of the ICD-10 at time of the 1-year follow-up. At the 1-year follow-up the distinction in non-remitted and remitted patients was confirmed by the results of the self-assessments and non-self-assessments. At admission non-remitted depressive patients presented themselves sicker than remitted patients, whereas at discharge those differences were rather apparent in case of the non-self-assessments. The study data show that in case of depressive patients self-assessment-scales and non-self-assessments-scales are qualified for the evaluation of a long-term outcome. ","1512":"It is often assumed that there is a predictive relationship between the onset of psychiatric disorder in young adulthood and the severity of their course. Because the significance is rather contradictive and poorly backed by empirical data, we have investigated this issue by a catamnestic approach. From 96 inpatients aged between 18 to 25 years with a first manifestation of a \"psychogenetic\" disorder 54 % were studied 8.6 +\/- 1.5 year later. In general there was a positive development as well psychopathological as social, although complete normalisation was not reached. This result is almost identical with catamnestic findings with comparative studies on older patients . Our findings do not support the concept of negative predictive value of first manifestation of psychogenetic disorder in early adulthood.

Treatment outcome is described with amount of take home, reduced delinquency, increased social reintegration as well as pharmacological treatment. 25 men and 17 women, age from 20 to 49 (29) have been in our treatment between 1 to 52 months (29). 20 of them (48 %) got an additional psychiatric medication, mostly antidepressants (42 %) but also neuroleptics (9,5 %). 21 patients had a drug free urine test (including cannabis) during the last month and could take their opiate medication at home. Necessity of support by social security declines from 25 % before to 16 % in substitution treatment. Also the need of unemployment benefit could be reduced from 36 % before to 26 % in treatment. Full time jobs increase from 31 % to 48 %, part time jobs from 3 % to 7 % in treatment.","1514":"A new concept for the out-patient clinic for environmental diseases (Umweltambulanz) of Augsburg central hospital was devised in July 1999. By April 2003 441 patients with environment-related disorders were examined. In a retrospective analysis the proportion and type of mental disorders were assessed as well as acceptance of the psychiatric therapy recommended. 5 % of patients received a psychiatric diagnosis - in most cases a somatoform disorder. Half of the patients did not accept the therapy recommended. In contrast to other studies the prevalence of mental disorders is low and has therefore to be discussed critically. ","1515":"According to the increasing number of foreign psychiatric patients in the German society, the influence of their linguistic integration on treatment characteristics is to be investigated. With criteria of nationality and German language skills, data of 6151 in-patients was collected and statistically analysed according to the objective. With statistically significant evidence we found a shorter average duration of hospital treatment in the group of linguistically badly integrated patients. In this group, involuntary hospital admission was significantly more frequent and release from hospital after regular end of treatment was significantly rarer. Linguistic communication problems may influence the cooperation and motivation in an ineffective way, which underlines the importance of supporting linguistic integration. ","1516":"A project of quality management funded by the German Ministry of Health is presented which aims at recording and reducing of coercive measures (seclusion, restraint, forced medication). Since 1997, a study group for prevention of violence and coercion consisting of physicians, nurses and other psychiatric professionals from 18 psychiatric hospitals is working in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bayern. A common documentation of coercive measures has been introduced, variables of interest such as percentage of patients exposed to coercive measures in each principal diagnostic group of the ICD-10 have been defined for purposes of benchmarking. Aims of the project are 1) a complete documentation of all coercive measures in 12 psychiatric hospitals in a 12-month period and a benchmarking, taking into account structural characteristics of the hospitals and the respective catchment area, 2) providing a manual for a one-day de-escalation training for all professional groups working with psychiatric patients. A pilot study demonstrated that about 9 % of all admitted patients have been exposed to coercive measures in a subset of the participating hospitals. The variance between the hospitals was rather high. ","1517":"Pathways of psychiatric in-patients before and after their hospital stay should be evaluated. Based on data of the psychiatric basic documentation of 4066 patients, predictors of type of referral as well as outpatient aftercare were analysed by means of logistic regression. 42.5 % of patients were admitted without any medical sending, 18.4 % by a general practitioner, and 9.8 % by a psychiatrist in private practice. Patients referred by a general practitioner suffered more frequently from affective disorders (Odds Ratio = 4.0) or schizophrenia (OR = 3.3), and were residents of a senior citizen home (OR = 3.5). Inpatients sent by a psychiatrist were more often residents of a sheltered home (OR = 2.8), had a present episode lasting more than three months (OR = 1.9) and psychopharmacological pre-treatment with atypical antipsychotics (OR = 1.6) or SSRI (OR = 1.8). Outpatient aftercare was recommended to 83.1 % of in-patients: Aftercare by a general practitioner was more frequent in patients with addiction disorders (OR = 2.0) and elderly patients (OR = 1.03). Referral by a psychiatrist in private practice (OR = 4.5) as well as schizophrenia (OR = 3.3) or affective disorders (OR = 2.4) led more often to an outpatient aftercare by a psychiatrist. Beside therapeutic requirements the referring person predicted the type of outpatient aftercare.

They were asked to rate the actual quantity of cooperation between their hospitals and diverse community based services and to express their requests concerning the quality of cooperation. An estimation of possible advantages of the hospitals' integration in GPVs and expectations to future perspectives of GPV development were also investigated. The data were collected by a written questionnaire. The results of the survey indicate that a high relevance is attached to GPV: inspite of current heterogenous developments and inspite of existing skepticism concerning the feasibility of a complete GPV structure, medical directors strongly approve of seeing their hospitals actively engaged in the further development of community psychiatry networks.","1519":"The study aimed to demonstrate how data from the psychiatric basic documentation system (DGPPN-BADO) are able to support the hospital management in making evidence-based decisions. Data from 14 327 psychiatric in-patients in the years 1997, 1999 and 2001 were analysed. About 40 % of patients were admitted without any medical sending, 20 % were referred by a general practitioner and 10 % by a psychiatrist in private practice. Between 1997 and 2001 an increase of patients with affective disorders and personality disorders was found. Comparing 1999 to 2001, patients showed greater deficits in their psychosocial capability (measured with GAF) at admission, but also at discharge. Outpatient aftercare was recommended to more than 80 % of in-patients, about 50 % by a general practitioner and about 33 % by a psychiatrist in private practice. 10 % of patients were cared by the own outpatient clinic. Data from the psychiatric basic documentation system could be shown as being relevant for evidence-based hospital management ensuring an effective and efficient in-patient treatment.

The aim of this work is to investigate their present relationship by means of an analysis of a scientific journal. All original works dealing with social psychiatric subjects and appearing in Psychiatrische Praxis in the years 2002 and 2003 were analysed. Sociologists appear to be a minority among the authors. Questions that are explicitly related to sociological theories were an exception, and sociological authors have hardly been quoted. Social psychiatric research in Germany is still conducted without Sociology. If social psychiatry is to gain in importance as a scientific discipline, closer cooperation with its mother discipline is imperative. As an example, the application of the rational choice theory in psychiatric research is discussed. ","1527":"Currently, there is still a severe lack of methodologically sound empirical studies on acute psychiatric day hospital treatment in German-speaking countries that analyse the effectiveness of this increasingly important mode of service provision. Within a randomised controlled study design implemented at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Dresden University of Technology, 99 general psychiatric patients received conventional inpatient treatment and 92 patients received acute day hospital treatment. At up to four time-points during the index-treatment episode patients were assessed at different levels of outcome: Psychopathology was rated by researchers using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (24-Item-Version), and patients evaluated their satisfaction with treatment (Patientenbogen zur Behandlungszufriedenheit); at admission and discharge patients also assessed their subjective quality of life (Manchester Assessment of Quality of Life). Mean scale scores of these instruments are used for the intention-to-treat-analysis. Discharge status on these scales as well as mean ratings on these scales within the index-treatment episode serve as measures of effectiveness. For statistically identifying differences between the two settings five linear (co-)variance-analytical models were calculated for each target variable. Four models were adjusted to baseline-rating or to the individual period spent in treatment. Initially, both groups did not differ in their relevant socio-demographic and illness-related features. Day hospital treatment (87,7 days) lasted significantly longer than inpatient treatment (67,8 days). Only results from an unadjusted statistical model as well as from a model adjusted to the individual period of index-hospitalisation demonstrated superior effectiveness of day hospital treatment on the discharge status of psychopathological symptomatology. However, in all statistical models there were no systematic differences of treatment-effectiveness related to satisfaction with treatment and subjective quality of life. For the first time in German-speaking countries, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of acute day hospital treatment as compared to conventional inpatient treatment. If detailed eligibility criteria for patients are used as defined here, approximately 30 % of the general psychiatric patients in need of acute hospital-based treatment may be cared for in this special mode of day hospital service provision.

Investigation by questionnaire completed by medical directors of German psychiatric hospitals (response quote 48.8 %). Descriptive data from 81 hospitals with 25 920 inpatient beds are presented relating to various indicators of structural quality of care in internal medicine (e. g. availability of internal medicine consultations, diagnostic equipment, as ECG, clinical chemistry laboratory, ultrasound). We found evidence of a satisfactory infrastructure relating to internal medicine in a majority of hospitals. However, there exist also indications of significant deficits pertaining to certain aspects of medical care in the institutions investigated. With regard to the importance of medical comorbidity in clinical psychiatry the availability of adequate resources in internal medicine is a relevant indicator of quality of care in psychiatric hospitals. ","1529":"Is an inferior outcome of psychiatric rehabilitation to be expected with patients who consume alcohol or addictive drugs in a problematic manner during rehabilitation treatment? Files and final reports from patients admitted to psychiatric rehabilitation during three successive years were analyzed. Data of patients with or without problematic use of psychotropic substances were compared. Patients with a problematic pattern of alcohol or drug consumption have a stronger propensity to quit psychiatric rehabilitation when a) using hard drugs or when b) bearing a diagnosis beyond the schizophrenia spectrum. The outcome of rehabilitation efforts of the subsample with a problematic use of drugs shows an unfavorable tendency concerning housing, but a better result in the vocational area. The problem has to be considered in a differenciated manner, which means that, in general, clients with a problematic use of alcohol or drugs should not automatically be excluded from psychiatric rehabilitation. ","1530":"Within the multiprofessional diagnostic in the psychiatric treatment for children an age-group of in-patients was examined using the coordination test for children (KTK) with regard to physical ability. The ascertained results and classifications of the motor skills were related to ICD 10 diagnosis on level 1 (clinical psychiatric syndrom) and level 2 (circumscribed disturbance of the development) as well as to issues of the anamnese- and report-documentation in order to ascertain correlations between child psychiatry disorder and motor development. More than 40 % of the children examined showed motor deficiency. Moreover, it was evident that girls attained significantly lower KTK-results than boys. The statistical results did not show any distinct effects to \"diagnosis\" and \"age\". The high quota of obviously impaired and disturbed children reflects the general decline of motor skills and does not seem to be attributed to the demand for psychiatric treatment for children and youth.

Analysis of the practise of distributing the competencies for accommodation for mental ill and handicapped persons in the 16 German Lander. 2. Assessment of the supply with accommodation for mental ill and handicapped persons in the Lander. 3. Investigation of a possible relationship between distribution of competencies for accommodation and number of accommodation in supported housing and hostels\/homes. Data about available accommodation in supported housing and hostels are inconsistently limited and available. As far as this data can be interpreted, Lander that have the administrative and particularly financial competency for accommodation uniquely organised, generally offer more supported housing. At the same time they provide relatively less accommodation in hostels and homes. Despite having the competencies for accommodation uniquely organised, some Lander continue to provide accommodation for mentally ill persons predominantly in hostels and homes. A comprehensive and between the Lander comparable system of documentation of accommodation for mentally ill and handicapped persons is highly needed. Unique organisation of competencies for accommodation of mental ill and handicapped persons is a necessary - however not commensurate precondition for the increase of the supply in supported housing. Beyond that, other factors seem to be influential, such as political will, attitudes towards the mentally ill, interests of hostel providers, pre-existing hostel infrastructure. In respect of these factors more research is needed.

The aim of this work is to determine the state of affairs of research in this field based on the publications in scientific journals. Including the German and international journals listed in the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for the psychosocial field, a systematic search was done for the year 2003. The majority of public mental health research in the German-speaking countries is focused on a few institutions only. Particularly for Germany, clear-cut regional distinctions can be found.

Since laymen's opinion is influenced by mass media, the portrayal of cognitive disorders was analysed using four volumes of a regional newspaper (\"Leipziger Volkszeitung\", LVZ). The predominant topics were related to cause and symptoms of dementia. Memory loss was depicted as the main symptom, non-cognitive symptoms were completely neglected. Therapy options and prevention were scantily touched; if at all, the tenor was one of futility. Unfortunately, dementia was often used as a devaluating metaphor. In the media, scientifically sound information on dementia is rare. Supporting journalists with expert knowledge may help dementia sufferers to profit from the new developments in the field.

The objective of the current study was to determine the incidence of delirious states and to identify possible risk factors. The sample consisted of 200 consecutive patients, age 60 years and older, who underwent hip surgery because of acute hip fracture or elective hip replacement. Patients were prospectively assessed preoperatively and on a daily basis postoperatively using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Associations between risk factors and delirium were analysed by means of multiple logistic regression models. 20.5 % of the sample were diagnosed with postoperative delirium. Statistically significant risk factors for the development of delirium were higher age, lower preoperative cognitive test performance and severe physical comorbidity. Some other putative risk factors tended to be associated with postoperative delirium, but failed to reach statistical significance. The study confirmed a high incidence of delirium among hip surgery patients. Apart from established risk factors like old age, low cognitive test performance, and comorbidity, no other significant risk factors could be identified. ","1536":"We postulated three level of dementia diagnostics: the general practitioner, the neuro-psychiatrist and the memory clinic. For each level, definite diagnostic questions were defined as the main diagnostic focus. The aim was to establish a staged process in dementia diagnostics, proposing for each diagnostic level a specific test battery suitable for the respective diagnostic focus. On each level, the test battery can be supplemented by other tests proposed on the subsequent diagnostic level. 159 patients were examined clinically, neuropsychologically, and neuroradiologically. Discriminant analyses were computed to find out which tests out of a comprehensive test battery are most suitable in differentiating between several diagnostic groups. The diagnostic accuracy of the test batteries proposed for general practitioners and neuro-psychiatrists were maximally 3 % below that of the complete test battery which we suggest for memory clinics. Depending on the diagnostic level, a definite short form of a comprehensive test battery can be implemented without unacceptably reducing diagnostic accuracy.

The sample consisted of elderly persons admitted to medical hospital departments (N = 372) and nursing homes (N = 249) in Austria. Study participants were investigated by research psychiatrists using the Clinical Interview Schedule. Of all patients with dementia, in medical departments 28 % and in nursing homes 38 % had marked or severe non-cognitive symptoms. Using multivariate regression procedures non-cognitive symptoms turned out to be significant predictors for nursing home referral, for a prolonged duration of hospital stay, and for impaired self-care. Non-cognitive symptoms of dementia occur frequently and have several negative consequences. Since such non-cognitive symptoms might be treatable, they should receive sufficient attention from the staff. ","1538":"The study aims to compare clients using institutions of geriatric day-care to residents in homes for the elderly with regard to functional impairment, dementia disorders, behavior problems and the care situation. A cross-sectional study of 17 geriatric day-care facilities in eight towns and cities in Baden examined the data for all 257 clients who received care on a given reference date. These clients were compared to a reference population drawn from all residents (N = 1,387) of 15 randomly selected residential and nursing homes in the city of Mannheim, whereby identical assessment procedures were used by qualified nursing staff. The average age of subjects in both groups was around 80 years, over three-fourths of whom were women. Home residents were more limited than the clients of geriatric day-care facilities with regard to their activities of daily living, above all with regard to their mobility. The percentage of moderate to severe dementia disorders at 58.6 % was equally high in both groups. In addition, symptoms of depression and behavior problems were observed among a substantial number of the day-care clients. While the inpatient sector places greater emphasis on basic care and treatment, day-care institutions focus primarily on measures of social therapy. The high percentage of demented yet still mobile clients in day-care facilities indicates the particular importance of this target group when it comes to providing at least partial stress relief for family care-givers.

Based on the conceptual background and pathophysiology of VaD, current diagnostic approaches and results from recent large-scale randomised preventative and therapeutic studies are reviewed. Epidemiological cohort studies and first intervention trials with anti-hypertensive drugs demonstrated the usefulness of antihypertensive drugs in the prevention of dementia. For the treatment of manifest VaD, no pharmaceutical substance has been approved to date, despite positive results in controlled studies with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

Prior to discharge QOL was assessed with WHOQOL-bref. With the help of multivariate statistics, the effect of illness and biographical factors on four domains of QOL (physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment) was analyzed. 103 patients suffered from unipolar depression, 51 from bipolar affective disorder (30 fulfilled criteria for a mixed or pure manic episode). With the exception of the domain environment for (mixed) manic patients, all patients reported lower QOL in all domains than was reported for the general population according to the German test manual. Multivariate analyses revealed that the chosen variables explained between 11.1 % (social relationships) and 33.6 % (psychological) of the variance of the QOL domains. The domains \"psychological\" and \"environment\" were first of all explained by the presence of a (mixed) manic episode, while the best variable to predict \"physical health\" was presence of comorbid neurotic disorder. The depression score had little additional effects on QOL. We found little support that the QOL domains of the WHOQOL-bref in affective disorder are only hidden depression scores, as has been argued before. Therefore, QOL could be an interesting construct to better understand differences between subjective evaluation and (supposedly) objective psychopathology in bipolar affective disorders. ","1543":"This study examines the extent to which depression affects specific objective life quality parameters. The respective life quality parameters were investigated on a long-term basis and concern the social and material resources of those persons surveyed. The database used for statistical evaluations originates from the longitudinal survey \"Zurich Study\" initiated in 1979. In this work the evaluations are limited to those persons who participated in all six structured interviews which took place between 1979 and 1999 (278 of initially 591 Persons). The effects of depression on the objective parameters of life quality were analyzed by linear and logistical regressions. According to this study, people suffering from depression show disadvantages regarding their living situation and their civil status. Among them one finds increased divorce and separation quota and they live more frequently alone than persons without depressive disorders. The findings refer to possible social withdrawal tendencies among people suffering from depression. Social withdrawal tendencies should be counteracted as far as possible by upholding or developing a network of firm contacts and relationships. Special attention should be paid in the therapy of depression patients to working out strategies for solving marriage crises or relationship conflicts. ","1544":"The paper reviews psychiatric epidemiological research in Germany focusing on studies conducted over the last two decades. Relevant studies were identified using Medline and Psyndex databanks. Inspired mainly by Anglo-American research, a substantial body of studies demonstrates the constitution of psychiatric epidemiology as a research field in Germany. The paper reviews field studies in children and adolescents, in adults and the elderly concerning scope, design and methods. Also those studies regarding special populations (i. e. homeless, persons living in nursing homes) usually not covered by field studies were included. Selected results of current surveys were reported to illustrate that mental disorders are common. Future challenges of psychiatric-epidemiological research include (1) the provision of internationally comparable data and (2) the description of individual and contextual risk- and protective factors of mental disorders. The latter can only be achieved by employing longitudinal designs where researcher should adopt a multi-level perspective in questioning and analysis. ","1545":"Methods and results from empirical research carried out so far on the prevalence of psychopathology in children and adolescents in Germany are presented. The relevant studies (n = 29) identified by systematic literature search are presented and compared in table form on the basis of important epidemiological key factors, and a descriptive analysis is provided. The prevalence of emotional and behavioral disorders is 17.2 +\/- 5.07 % (M +\/- SD). Determination of the prevalence rates is influenced by the study methods used. The results presented here do not indicate an increase or decrease in the prevalence of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence over the past decades. The results are discussed with respect to study quality, also in an international context, and recommendations are made for standardization of future studies. ","1546":"","1547":"In cases of treatment-resistant schizophrenic psychoses combined application of atypical antipsychotic drugs is an often-used strategy. We report the case of a 35-year old man with paranoid schizophrenia, whose symptoms turned out to be resistant to the application of olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine. After switch to clozapine paranoid delusions remitted, but schizophrenic negative symptoms persisted and side effects limited the patient's compliance. Augmentation with ziprasidone allowed a reduction of the clozapine dose and ameliorated the affective deficits. Positive and negative symptoms were well controlled. In spite of a transient hyperprolactinaemia and sexual dysfunction the patient was highly content. The combined application of ziprasidone and clozapine follows a neurobiological rationale, seems able to reduce side effects, and should be further evaluated with respect to risk and benefit in prospective studies. ","1548":"The availability of predictive testing for neurodegenerative diseases such as Chorea Huntington has far-reaching consequences on psychological, ethical, and legal issues. The special situation of persons vulnerable for the disease requires a comprehensive counselling including psychotherapeutic measures. On the basis of a case report, the authors outline a psychodynamic practice, which intends not only the identification of deliberate arguments and development of coping strategies, but also a clarification of unconscious backgrounds and expectations. In the discussion, the necessity of sufficient time is stressed that allows the reflection of repressed motives in respect of the genetic testing.","1549":"Epidemiological studies show overweight to be a major health problem in Germany. There is some evidence that psychiatric patients often are overweight. In view of the high frequency of weight gain during the treatment with neuroleptics, particularly atypicals, in this study the bodyweight of schizophrenics should be examined. The body-mass-index (BMI) of two samples of schizophrenic inpatients was compared to BMI-data of the German general population. 90 inpatients with the first episode of schizophrenic psychoses showed an average BMI of 22.2 +\/- 3.3. The BMI in all age groups were lower compared to the general population, but in a follow-up these patients showed a higher weight gain. 238 chronic schizophrenic inpatients with at least 5 years duration of illness (mean 15.3 +\/- 8.3 years) showed BMI-values in the range of the general population. Only the age group 30 - 35 years showed a significantly higher BMI. However, in many age groups of schizophrenic inpatients the proportion of obesity (BMI &gt; 30) was higher compared to the general population. The bodyweight of first episode schizophrenics is lower compared to the general population. In contrast, chronic schizophrenic patients frequently are overweight or show obesity. However, thus far the causes of pronounced weight gain in schizophrenic patients remain to be elucidated. ","1550":"Frequent utilization of psychiatric inpatient care was mainly analysed by quantitative methods. The present study combines quantitative with qualitative methods and discusses the results obtained from these different perspectives. The quantitative analysis is based on data from 184 schizophrenia patients, who were observed over a period of 2(1\/2) years. Twenty of the identified frequent users and 6 employees of psychiatric facilities were interviewed by means of qualitative methods as to the causes of frequent use of inpatient care. Predictors of frequent use identified in the quantitative study were found again in the qualitative analysis. Opportunities for alternative care for frequent users suggested by the staff of psychiatric facilities include social treatment in the community, day structuring activities and sheltered work. Patients consider work, compliance securing and better contact with office based psychiatrists to be important factors. Patients and staff give different priorities to their suggestions for interventions, but are, in most cases, of the opinion, that part of hospital admissions of frequent users could be avoidable by means of alternative services.

The scope, structure and whereabouts of the target group were initially unknown. 17 of 22 homeless women identified agreed to participate in an extensive study including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SKID-I). The prevalence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders was 71 %; the leading disorder was substance abuse\/dependence (43 %), followed by anxiety disorders (35 %) and schizophrenia (12 %). Multiple diagnoses were made in 35 % of the women. Striking features were the often early onset of homelessness and the reticence in seeking help. The flight from violence was a crucial precipitant of the loss of the home and should also be discussed in the context of the development of the psychiatric disorders. This study is the first involving women outside major cities. Precipitant situation, need for help and help-seeking pattern appear to deviate markedly from those of homeless men. The results should be verified in further gender-specific studies.

Pertinent psychiatric literature published since 1970 was reviewed comprehensively. Recurring themes were identified, and were discussed in terms of historical trends and conceptual contradictions. Papers discussing sexuality and its relevance to psychiatric services can be summarised under three conceptual headings: (1) sexuality as taboo, (2) normalisation\/empowerment, and (3) problematisation. The three clusters of papers focusing on these aspects were consecutive in time. During the 1970s and 1980s patients' equal rights to sexuality were weighed against moralistic concerns. Currently, patients' sexuality is discussed against the background of potentially negative consequences for the individual patient. A discussion is needed that encompasses this dilemma in order to find ways towards adequate practical handling of the issue of patients' sexuality in psychiatric services. ","1557":"The subject of this case-report is the life-history, nosogenesis and history of compensation claims of a 64-years old Sinti-woman, who survived Nazi-persecution and WWII as a child. She and her mother spent 3 years in a concentration camp. At the end of the war she witnessed her mothers death. Her life is characterised by psychosomatic symptoms, disorders of psychosexual development, including infertility, and a chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The non-treated course of the Holocaust survivor syndrom, described by Niederland, which was mostly denied in Germany, could be now shown by detailed exploration and the reanalysis of former expert reports of her symptoms. Furthermore, this case report presents the internationally described characteristics of long-term effects in children that have survived the Holocaust. These symptoms are typical of cases that were not been treated throughout life. The former lack of acceptance in Germany of these long-term effects has - like in this and other cases - lead to development into a chronic disorder.","1558":"Little is known concerning the frequency of disability payments due to depressive and bipolar affective disorders in Germany. 177 consecutive psychiatric in-patients were assessed with standardized interviews concerning diagnosis (SCID-I, DSM-IV) and illness history. To compare unipolar depressive and bipolar affective patients, a survival analysis was calculated. 116 patients suffered from unipolar depression, 61 from bipolar affective disorder. Highly significantly, patients with bipolar affective disorders were granted disability payments more frequently and at an earlier age. Half of the bipolar affective patients received disability payments by the age of 46 years, half of the unipolar depressive patients by the age of 58 years. In this sample, bipolar affective patients received disability payments frequently and at an early age, which stresses that the prognosis of bipolar affective disorders is not as good as has been assumed for a long time. Early disability payments may lead to poverty and may obstruct access to social rehabilitation. ","1559":"The high rank of social work in context with psychiatric treatment of in-patients is generally accepted. The value of social work and here especially the visit at home by the social worker has hardly been examined up to now. In the article first of all the method of visits at home is presented. Furthermore all visits at home by a female social worker of an outpatient clinic over a period of three years are retrospectively evaluated. In connection with 28 patients (54 +\/- 14 years old) 218 visits - in total - were carried out. It is remarkable that - apart from one case - the patients were at home and the social worker was admitted to their private rooms. By far most frequently the emphasis of the visit at home was assigned to the solution of actual problems within the framework of a long-term socio-therapeutic process. In further discussion it will be crucial to work out indications and contraindications as well as directives for technical execution and - if necessary - to develop differential indications for different types of visits at home for different groups of patients.

This paper describes psychopathology and sociodemographic characteristics. A random sample of 116 former long-stay patients were followed for an average 42.9 months after discharge. Patients had spent an average 19.3 years in psychiatric wards. 47 patients (40.5 %) were placed in nursing homes, 16 patients (13.8 %) in old-age homes, 32 patients (27.6 %) in other institutions and only 15 patients (12.9 %) in group homes, and 6 patients (5.2 %) with families. ICD-10 diagnosis was schizophrenia in 56 patients (48.3 %) and mental retardation in 33 patients (28.4 %). Level of social and functional disabilities was high. Most long-stay patients were able to live outside psychiatric hospitals, but institutional care still plays an essential role. ","1561":"The article studies the role of financing mental health care for the mental health care service structure in the process of moving towards a patient-oriented and decentralised mental health care system. The analysis is based on a description of the Austrian mental health care financing system and a discourse-analytical examination of reform documents and interviews with key actors in this country. Existing structures of mental health care services are a reflection of mental health care financing structures. Reform goals are in various forms linked to financing issues. However, an explicit discussion of the finance issues in reform documents is widely missing. Adapting the finance of mental health care to new paradigms of mental health care provision requires not just technical modifications, but also improved transparency of processes and implications involved. ","1562":"Aim of this study is the documentation of illness-associated costs for spouses, whose relative is suffering from a mental illness. Over a period of 12 month, 117 spouses of patients who are suffering from schizophrenia, depression or anxiety disorders repeatedly filled in a standardized questionnaire about illness related expenses and financial losses. 90 % of the spouses reported direct cash expenditures on behalf of the patients' illness. On average, these costs amounted to yearly expenditures of euro 1146 (range: euro 0 - 11 910). Costs did not differ significantly across types of illness and income was not found to be a significant covariate. Spouses reported substantial direct cash expenditures on behalf of the patients' illness. Since these expenditures varied to a large extent over the three points of measurement, repeated measurement designs seem to be a prerequisite for a reliable assessment of illness-associated costs. Since living together with a mentally ill partner is associated with an increased risk of developing a burden-related psychiatric illness for spouses themselves which may lead to double costs and double decreases in income, these aspects should be taken into consideration when planning changes in health policy.

Mathematical formulation of the relationship between the costs of a quality improvement program and the degree of underuse and overuse. The example of reducing underuse in the treatment of major depression shows that an intervention with a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio may be economically unattractive if a quality improvement program incurs high costs secondary to a small quality deficit. The application example also shows that reducing treatment overuse is inefficient if overuse is small and hence the costs of a quality improvement program are higher than the costs of overuse. The explicit consideration of the size of an underuse or overuse problem in the cost-effectiveness ratio of a quality improvement program may contribute to a more efficient use of health care resources.

In a prospective longitudinal study with 5 points of measurement incidence and the costs of inpatient treatment, the type of antipsychotic medication, as well as the clinical and social characteristics of 307 outpatients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD 10 F 20.0) were assessed over a period of 2.5 years. The impact of antipsychotic medication on the incidence of inpatient treatment was analysed by means of a random-effect logit model. The impact of antipsychotic medication on the costs of inpatient treatment was analysed by means of a random-effect tobit model. Selection effects were controlled by means of propensity scores. Patients who received antipsychotic treatment with conventional, new atypical or depot neuroleptics had a lower incidence of inpatient treatment and caused lower costs in comparison to patients without antipsychotic treatment. The same effect was found for patients who received a combined treatment with conventional and depot neuroleptics. No effects were found for clozapine or for a combination treatment with conventional and atypical neuroleptics. No significant differences between the effects of conventional, new atypical or depot-neuroleptics were found. The application of neuroleptic medication in schizophrenia treatment generally reduces the incidence and the costs of inpatient treatment. An extension of the use of clozapine or new atypical neuroleptics to all patients with schizophrenia will not generally improve the treatment effectiveness regarding to the incidence and the costs of inpatient treatment. ","1571":"The assessment of quality of life with a single index, which is necessary for cost-utility analyses, causes a loss of information. Therefore the suitability of such indices for mental health and non-mental health conditions was analysed and their ability to detect effects of medical interventions was examined. Quality of life of 18 schizophrenic patients and 26 patients with diabetes mellitus was rated three times using disease specific instruments (BELP-KF, DMLQ), visual analog scale (VAS), EQ-5D and time trade-off (TTO). Effects of medical interventions were only detected with the disease specific instruments and EQ-5D. Using TTO and EQ-5D, there were significant, but reverse differences in the quality of life of patients with diabetes and patients with schizophrenia. EQ-5D correlated highly with DMLQ, but lowly with BELP-KF. TTO and VAS were insensitive to effects of medical interventions. EQ-5D detected treatment-induced changes, but was inappropriate as a measure of quality of life in schizophrenic patients. ","1572":"Economic evaluation of health care interventions may require preference-based valuations of health outcomes or health effects. This paper provides an overview of the use of standard gamble (SG), time trade-off (TTO) and contingent valuation (CV) to elicit preferences of patients with depression or schizophrenia. A systematic search of the literature was conducted covering the use of SG, TTO and CV in patients with depression or schizophrenia. Practicability, measurement results, construct and concurrent validity as well as test-retest-reliability formed the criteria for reviewing the performance of these measures of preference. SG, TTO and CV were rarely used in the two diagnostic groups considered. The reviewed studies mostly showed good practicability as well as some evidence for validity and reliability. Measured SG und TTO values point to substantial losses in utility caused by these diseases. Elicitation of patient preferences for the economic evaluation of mental health care seems possible.

We show that in our patient neuroimaging such as SPECT scan can prove parietal lobe abnormalities. We describe possible links between these findings and her symptoms. ","1575":"Citizens of Novosibirsk were questioned regarding their ideas about schizophrenia and depressive disorders, with one of the main concerns being a comparison with the ideas and attitudes of the German population. In 2002, a representative survey (N = 745) was conducted among the adult population of Novosibirsk, using a fully structured interview that has been used in previous surveys in Germany. Symptoms of schizophrenia were more frequently identified as an indication of mental disorder than were depressive symptoms. Psychosocial stress and biological influences were similarly frequently seen as the cause of schizophrenia, with the former prevailing among the respondents in the case of depressive symptoms. Psychotherapy was most frequently recommended as a treatment measure, also for schizophrenia. Supposing that no treatment measures will be taken, respondents assessed the prognosis for both mental disorders negatively. Conversely, interviewees gave a positive treatment prognosis. Respondents from Germany and Novosibirsk showed similar beliefs, especially as regards the importance of biological influences and psychosocial stress and the assessment of psychotherapy as compared to psychopharmacology. However, German and Russian respondents also held differing views: a comparatively strong tendency of the Russian population to consider mental disorders as self-inflicted - an important finding that could shape future anti-stigma programs. ","1576":"Although per capita consumption of alcohol has stagnated during the last years there is some evidence of a tendency to earlier alcohol drinking. Within the context of this study we have evaluated 556 inpatients of 25 hospitals in North Germany, specializing in alcohol problems. The results of this multicenter study draw the conclusion that the tendency of an earlier alcohol consumption is related to an earlier beginning of habit-forming drinking. Therefore young people develop a problematic drinking style at an earlier time. A fatal progress that leads to growing danger in adolescents and increasing numbers of severe alcoholics.","1577":"Repeated drunkenness became a contradiction in terms of a healthy and rational life style in the context of the Enlightenment in the 18th century. Corresponding to the self-referential understanding of man as an independent and rational being repeated drunkenness could not longer be understood as a conscious decision or a vice. The central point of the new paradigm of dependence was the installation of a special urge by a specific chronic chemical traumatization. But this original paradigm also required the acceptance of the human individual as a depth-structured being and shows influence by the Brownianism, therefore it is also an unspecific concept. This understanding corresponds with the modern anthropology, in which the human being is understood two-fold: on the one hand his consciousness and mind, on the other hand his unconsciousness, body and world around.","1578":"There are complaints of an undertreatment of schizophrenic patients with atypical antipsychotics in German outpatients. Together with reluctance to start treatment with second generation antipsychotics, change of medication after inpatient treatment is often held responsible for the more frequent use of typical compounds. However, global statistics of prescriptions are difficult to interpret. To get data of the current practice, 132 patients treated with atypical antipsychotics in a university clinic were followed-up one year later. Of the patients that could be reached and still received medication, 82 (94%) were treated with atypical antipsychotics. The results indicate that change to conventional antipsychotics in outpatients does not considerably contribute to the low prescription of atypical antipsychotics. ","1579":"The aim of the study - undertaken at eight psychiatric hospitals in Hessen - was to analyse the practice in psychopharmacological treatment of schizophrenia and suicidal tendencies. The results indicate that inpatient antipsychotic treatment practice significantly differs from current therapeutic guidelines. Atypical neuroleptic medication is prescribed to a much lesser extent than would have been expected, especially regarding the official therapeutic guidelines. The inpatient treatment practice of acute suicide in severe depression, on the other hand, is concomitant with the therapeutic guidelines. The results are discussed and the development of guidelines for inpatient routine - oriented towards the current guidelines for psychopharmaceutical treatment - is suggested.","1580":"To obtain indicators for the setup and further development of appropriate provisions for relatives of long-term schizophrenia patients in Tyrol (Austria), the quality of life of the main caring relatives of these patients was assessed and compared to that of a control group from the general population. In addition we were interested in identifying variables that may be useful predictors of the relatives' quality of life. Fourty-four relatives of long-term schizophrenia patients and 90 controls of the general population were included in the study. To assess their quality of life we employed the generic questionnaire WHOQOL-100, complemented by own questions reflecting the special situation of the relatives. The quality of life of the relatives was significantly lower than that of the general population in almost all domains assessed. Fear of discrimination, concern about the care of the patient in later life and the feeling of a lack of security because of the patient correlated significantly with a reduced quality of life of the relative. Living in separate households went along with a higher quality of life of the relative. The association between the relatives' quality of life and their involvement in self-help groups or patient participation in social-psychiatric rehabilitation was unexpectedly low. The results of our investigation indicate in which domains there is a need to improve mental-health services and to develop and extend efforts of self-help groups in order to raise the quality of life of relatives of long-term schizophrenia patients. ","1581":"","1582":"The diagnosis kleptomania is based on diagnostic criteria which describe a particular distinctive behaviour. Both the DSM-IV and the WHO-ICD10 neglect the different etiologic possibilities. The high co-morbidity of kleptomania with other mental disorders is another problem. The assessment of legal responsibility should not only focus on the analysis of the stealing act, but has to consider potential associated psychopathology. It appears insufficient to describe complex organic disorders (for example a dementia) with the term kleptomania. However, the forensic relevance of kleptomania, which seems to be very rare, is a result of symptom progression, decreasing satisfaction and feelings of shame or distress.","1583":"A standardised and systematic analysis of commitment laws in the EU-Member States is still missing. This study aimed at gathering, describing and analysing information on the differences or similarities of legal frameworks for involuntary placement and treatment of mentally ill patients across the European Union Member States. Information was gathered by means of a detailed questionnaire filled in by experts from all EU Member States. Legal criteria for compulsory admission, details of the assessment and decision process of compulsory admission and epidemiological data are outlined. Although common patterns among Member States can be identified upon comparison of crucial legislative or procedural details, these patterns are far from being consistent across all analysed items or approaches. With regard to compulsory admission quotas no significant influence of legal commitment criteria and the involvement of judicial authorities could be found but Member States with an obligatory inclusion of a legal representative during the commitment procedure showed significantly lower compulsory admission quotas. Results of this study show the strong necessity for further research in this field. Common international health reporting standards as annually updated involuntary placement rates detailed for regular and emergency cases seem to be essential. ","1584":"Associations between voluntariness of treatment, success of treatment, and number of hospital admissions should be examined. 88 consecutive admissions with ICD-10 F2 disorders were assessed using the PANSS and the GAF at admission and discharge. Voluntariness was assessed regarding admission, hospital stay, medication, time of discharge, and treatment continuation in four degrees for each category. Voluntariness increased significantly with the number of hospital admissions in women. Outcome measures (PANSS and GAF differences admission\/discharge and the respective differences divided by number of inpatient days) were not significantly related to any aspect of voluntariness. Voluntariness was negatively associated with PANSS-scores at admission, but not at discharge. Aggressive behaviour and coercive measures were observed more frequently in patients with aspects of involuntariness. The short-term success of treatment in acute schizophrenic episodes seems not to be affected by measures of compulsive treatment. There is some evidence that experiences with former inpatient treatment increase the degree of voluntariness in women.

Simultaneously, a survey of successful suicide attempts in the city of Plauen was carried out. The main point of interest was the motivation for the suicide attempts and the personal situation of the persons involved, most especially the influence of the social changes after 1990, towards their suicidal behaviour. As expected, the number of patients in full-time employment in 1995 was noticeably lower than in the preceding years, despite the fact that unemployment was not more often given as a reason for suicide attempts. In all the periods examined, conflicts within partnership structures played an outstanding role amongst the reasons for attempted suicides. An increase in attempted suicides due to endogenous depression was observed only in 1990.","1586":"34 patients (50 % adjustment disorder) were investigated at admission, at discharge and 2 years after participating in a 2-week crisis intervention program. Measures included SCL-90R, BDI and the Giessen-Test at all time points and a semi-structured interview at follow-up. Patients still suffered from residual symptoms at follow-up. Patients with a partner conflict were readmitted to inpatient care more often. Focussing the patient's perceived predominant problem during crisis intervention had a favourite follow-up outcome. Therapists should ensure repetitively that the predominant psychosocial problem according to the patient's view stays the focus of a crisis intervention. Individual assessment, especially regarding the preferred treatment modality during crisis intervention, may help to plan post intervention treatment. ","1587":"In a group of 105 mentally ill immigrants we investigated the intensity and the frequency of aggressive behaviour at the time of admission with the help of two standardized instruments: the \"Social Dysfunction and Aggression Scale\" (SDAS) and the \"Modified Overt Aggression Scale\" (MOAS). As many as possible collateral informants were contacted to gather all information available for the aggressiveness rating. The immigrant group was compared to a matched group of German patients. 416 German patients had to be investigated until 105 of them fulfilled the matching criteria. The matching variables were: age, gender, diagnosis (ICD-10), severity of mental illness (CGI) and social status. The physicians who carried out the matching process and who carried out the aggression-rating were \"blind\" to the aim of the investigation. We found out that there was no significant difference between immigrants and German patients when the sum-scores of the SDAS and the MOAS are compared (N = 210). When SDAS single variables were compared German patients had a higher severity and frequency of \"physical violence towards other persons\". We interpreted this finding as an increased level of disinhibition which may be correlated to a higher acceptance of aggressive behaviour in German culture compared to normative beliefs of Mediterranean immigrants.","1588":"The aim of this study was to get an idea of the need of psychiatric therapy in a prison. We report on the period May 2000 to January 2002. 60 medical files with the sociodemographic variables and the psychiatric diagnosis were evaluated. 45 % of the examined prisoners had a diagnosis of drug- or alcohol dependency and 31.3 % had a diagnosis of a schizophrenia. In 26.7 % the therapy was successful and the prisoners improved. This results show a great need of psychiatric therapy in a prison. Also in a prison improvements in the course of psychic disturbances are possible.","1589":"","1590":"Voting behaviour of chronic mentally ill patients should demonstrate that this group may act as a political interest group. Residents of therapeutic facilities for mentally ill patients were questioned on their voting behaviour after the Federal Election to the Bundestag in 1994, 1998 and 2002. There was a stable preference for the parties from the \"left wing\", more than (2\/3) of the study population voted for the Social Democrats or the Green party. It was important for 17.2 % of the clients that a party puts emphasis on the interests of the mentally ill. Chronic mentally ill patients show a different voting behaviour than the general population. Their voting decision is partially related to their specific interests, which could give them a lobby-like status. This should be taken into consideration in the future development and planning of mental health care systems. ","1591":"This paper analyses the history of names for psychiatric institutions in the German language. When scientific, medical psychiatry came into being in the late 18 (th) century, names with negative connotations such as \"Narrenhaus\" or \"Tollhaus\" (approximating to the English word \"madhouse\") were substituted by the then neutral \"Irrenhaus\" and later in the 19 (th) century by \"Irrenanstalt\". Soon, however, this new term became associated with negative connotations, making it unsuitable as a reflection of the many improvements made both in the treatment and the public image of psychiatric service users. Changes in word form such as \"Heilanstalt\", \"Pflegeanstalt\" and \"Heil- und Pflegeanstalt\" better reflect the character of the institutions. Objections to the word \"Anstalt\" (institution) were not acknowledged until the 20 (th) century when the term \"Fachkrankenhaus\" (\"specialist hospital\") was introduced. Before then the German word \"Klinik\" was reserved for university hospitals, the first of which was founded in 1878. The history of names for psychiatric institutions reflects both changes in the treatment of the mentally ill and the attempts made above all by psychiatrists to face and overcome stigmatisation of their clients.","1592":"The paper is aimed at investigating what the actual topics of social-psychiatric research in German speaking countries are. German and international journals covering psychiatry and adjacent disciplines were screened for articles dealing with social-psychiatric topics. All in all, 426 relevant articles were identified and subjected to a content analysis. Almost one third of all articles was dealing with research on mental health services. Another research area that was strongly represented was epidemiology. By contrast, articles devoted to the study of psycho-social causes of mental disorders and psycho-social determinants of its course were rather rare. Possible reasons for the observed trends in social-psychiatric research are discussed. Potential risks for social psychiatry resulting from a too one-sided emphasis on health service research are pointed out. ","1593":"In mental health service research, the investigated services and care systems as well as the research methodology should be described in a precise and transparent fashion so that findings can be clearly interpreted and used. Therefore, this study investigates what is reported in German language publications on mental health service research. All original papers on mental health service research, that were published in the Psychiatrische Praxis between 1999 and 2002, were systematically reviewed and, using a structured classification system, subjected to content analysis. In particular, it was assessed what forms of care had been studied and what characteristics of care were reported. 54 % (199) of all original publications reported mental health service research in a wide sense. Of these, 8 % were qualitative studies. 58 % of studies investigated in-patient treatment, 20 % comprehensive care systems, and 4 % services provided by psychiatrists or psychotherapists in private office practice. There were hardly any studies on innovative service models. In 51 % of studies, authors had conducted investigations within their own service or care system. In most articles characteristics of the patient sample were exactly described, whilst precise information on the researched service, such as funding, staffing and organisation, was usually missing. There still is relatively little research on outpatient services, and mental health service research is not yet appropriately based in the community. Requirements for exact and comprehensive descriptions of the researched services' and care systems are rarely met. In general, the findings suggest that mental health service research in German speaking countries might benefit from studies with researchers who are independent from the investigated service, the evaluation of innovative service models, and above all a standardised description of the services and context in research studies. ","1594":"","1595":"In the process of stigmatisation psychiatry is not neutral but it is up-to-date as well as historically involved. That is why it is responsible to influence not only the social perception of psychiatry but also the public picture of mentally disturbed people in a positive way. Doing so it is dependent on the help of psychosis-experienced persons and relatives. Only working together a plausible enlightenment, that points beyond the status quo, can be achieved. Anti-stigma work must critically reflect the interactions in psychiatry itself. After an analysis of the different concepts of stigmatisation and anti-stigma work there follows the evaluation of an information campaign at schools in Hamburg, which emerged from the Hamburg psychosis seminar. The personal meeting of students and psychosis experienced persons is of immediate importance. In addition to that media about the subject \"being different, madness, mental disturbation\" are being placed at the teachers disposal according to their wishes. In the meantime experience is there of more then 50 teaching units in primary advanced and secondary education as well as of a special open day attended by over 500 students. The response of students and teachers is definitely positive. For the psychosis experienced persons involved there is a special benefit in the sense of empowerment. The more health politically based motives of the anti-stigma work have meanwhile been completed by educational justifications. This way of open meeting is also being discussed as a completion to the symptom based early diagnosis.","1596":"The goal of this study is to investigate the stigma of mental illness from the perspective of the persons directly affected by it. 210 patients with schizophrenia or major depression were questioned about anticipated and concrete stigmatization experiences, using a questionnaire especially developed for this study. Most of the patients expected negative reactions from the environment. Three quarters were convinced that their job application would be rejected when it became known that they are mentally ill. Almost two thirds felt apprehensive that others would avoid them due to their illness. There is hardly any difference between schizophrenia and depressive patients' assessment of stigmatization of mentally ill people. Concrete stigmatization experiences were most frequently reported in the domain of interpersonal interaction. Second comes the distorted picture of mentally ill people that is depicted in the media and experienced as hurtful by the patients. The obstacles to access social roles (partnership, work, etc.) perceived by the patients come third. Participants least frequently mentioned structural discrimination, i. e. disadvantages regarding psychiatric treatment or rehabilitation measures. Contrary to anticipated stigmatization, there are differences between the two diagnostic groups when it comes to concrete stigmatization experiences. Schizophrenia patients more frequently report that others would avoid contact with them and that the access to social roles was especially complicated for them. They also seemed to be more exposed to structural discrimination than depressive patients. Based on the results of this study, ways are discussed of how stigmatization and discrimination of mentally ill people can be reduced. ","1597":null,"1598":"The perception of how most people stigmatize mentally ill persons has consequences for the affected. Is a former stay in a mental hospital connected with an additional stigma? In three linguistic areas of Switzerland we conducted a representative opinion survey (N = 1737) on public attitude towards mental illness, psychiatric treatment, and the institutions involved. Using Link's \"devaluation-discrimination-scale\" a randomly selected sample was asked on the telephone about the perceived stigma concerning (1) a currently mentally ill person or (2) a former mentally ill person or (3) a former mental inpatient. In all three linguistic areas of Switzerland we found in the case of current illness a lower social acceptance or a higher discrimination, respectively. Also in all linguistic areas those who were asked about \"former mental illness\" or \"former stay in a mental hospital\" did not differ regarding perceived acceptance or discrimination. Our data does not confirm the assumption of increased stigma because of a former stay in a mental hospital. An inquiry of subjective experience of a hospital stay, however, would probably lead to other results than that of a public survey. ","1599":"Comparing experts' and lay opinions towards restrictions on mentally ill people. We conducted a representative telephone survey with psychiatrists (N = 87) and lay persons (N = 90). Compulsory admission towards people with mental illness is the most accepted restriction (experts 98.9 %\/lay persons 72.2 %) followed by the withdrawal of the driver license (6.7 %\/54.1 %), abortion suggested for mentally ill women in case of pregnancy (5.6 %\/19.4 %), and the withdrawal of the right to vote (1.1 %\/17.4 %). If assessing and carrying out restrictive measures towards people with mental illness, experts have to consider the discrepancy between their and the lay persons' opinions. Furthermore, professionals have to take an active role in the public discussion about sanctions that are not laid down in law by the law, e. g. abortion in case of pregnancy of a mentally ill woman, and that are not medically required. Thus, they contribute to the fight against the stigma that mentally ill people are faced with.

Survey with pre-post-questionnaire to assess the knowledge about schizophrenia, stereotypical attitudes and social distance. Differences between the audience's knowledge about schizophrenia and expert opinion increased. Negative stereotypes reinforced and social distance increased. Treatment- and rehabilitation opportunities and coping with the illness in everyday life as well as the important role of support by family members and friends should be more accentuated to mediate more positive attitudes. ","1601":"According to results of the latest research, the state of knowledge of the German population regarding depressive disorders has improved during the last years. The question arises to what extent the print media have contributed to this development. All editions of three German dailies--Sueddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) and Bild Zeitung (BZ)--published in the first months of each quarter in 1990 and 2000 were analysed. All articles that were identified using the search key *depress* were included. A full text search was carried out, except for the editions of SZ and FAZ from the year 2000 which are available on CD-ROM. Using a coding system specifically designed for this study, a quantitative content analysis was carried out taking into consideration both formal and contents-related aspects. None of the three newspapers investigated helps to promote better understanding of depressive disorders. A comparison between 1990 and 2000 shows that there has been no development towards a more adequate representation of depression in any of the dailies examined. When aspects of the illness are mentioned it is mostly in the form of speculations over etiological factors. Rarely published articles that are rather confusing for lay people mostly report details taken out of their context. The term \"depression\" is often used metaphorically. Among the few descriptions of people with depression, negative aspects prevail. The image of depression as a serious mental illness can hardly be developed by reading the newspapers investigated. The improvement in lay people's state of knowledge cannot be attributed to a more adequate representation of depression in the daily newspapers examined. ","1602":"This study provides an overview of the research on subjective stigmatization of mentally ill people. All articles on this topic that have been published since the mid 1980 were analyzed. Mentally ill people are exposed to stigmatization in many ways. The anticipated and experienced stigmatizations as well as their attempts chosen for coping have fatal effects on their social relationships, their working situation, and their quality of life. The same is true for the emotional well-being and the self-esteem of the ill. In addition, the fear of stigmatization has a negative effect on the help seeking behavior and the compliance of the ill with the psychiatric treatment. Efforts aimed at reducing stigmatization of mentally ill people should not be confined to fighting the discrimination objectively existing, but should also take into consideration the subjective stigma experiences of the persons affected.

M (no. of prescriptions per month) denotes mean frequency over one period, A (no. per month) denotes amplitude, tau (month) corresponds to the period and phi (month) to the phase of the fitted curve. Data were evaluated descriptively and chronograms including 95%-confidence limits were given. Significant nonlinear regression models could be calculated for amoxicillin, paroxetine, citalopram, amitriptyline and buspirone prescription behaviour. Both circannual and ultra-annual (period shorter than one year) rhythms of prescription were found. Peak values for antibiotic drug prescription during fall and winter is probably associated with higher incidence of infectious diseases. Antidepressant drug prescription has maxima in spring and fall, which is in keeping with the epidemiology of depressive disorders. The seasonality of buspirone prescription may reflect a basic periodicity of anxiety disorders. In conclusion, the chronopharmaco-epidemiological data of antibiotic and antidepressant drug prescription with circannual and ultra-annual rhythms may reflect the periodicity of infectious and psychiatric diseases.","1607":"\"Psychopathy\" describes a type of personality disorder characterized by a dysregulation of emotion processing. Social behaviour, emotion regulation and competency are of particular relevance in forensic psychiatry. Structural-morphological and functional imaging studies prove that emotion regulation, aggressive-impulsive behaviour and learning from negative experiences are greatly influenced by frontal brain regions. These abilities are impaired in severe cases of dissocial personality disorders and in traumatic \"pseudopsychopathy\". We illustrate the importance functional neurobiological changes in patients personality disorders and \"acquired psychopathy\" by two case reports on patients who were admitted to a forensic-psychiatric facility for sexual crimes.","1608":null,"1609":"Recently, a putative functional polymorphism (-141C Ins\/Del) in the 5'-flanking region of the dopamine D2 receptor was found. An association of the Ins allele with schizophrenia has been described in a Japanese sample. In the present study this association was examined in a German schizophrenia patient population. In a family based approach 190 German family trios were analyzed for the -141C Ins\/Del genotype. Using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) we found no evidence for an association of the Ins allele with schizophrenia (TDT = 0.152, P = 0.696). In parallel, we performed an independent case control study with 268 schizophrenic patients and 244 controls. Again, we did not detect an overrepresentation of the Ins allele in patients (P = 0.124). Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that the -141C Ins variant plays a major role in predisposition to schizophrenia. To confirm our conclusion further preferentially family based studies are needed.","1610":"Two years ago the multiprofessional team of the Memory Centre Erlangen took up its work. Besides complete diagnoses of the cause of memory impairment, the work of the Memory Centre focusses on a special cognitive stimulation intervention. After completing assessment, namely self- and non-self anamnesis, psychometric tests and medical examinations, an individual treatment program for every patient will be development. In most instances the treatment program includes the participation in a special cognitive training. Adapting the SIMA-Program, psychomotor exercises, encoding strategies, retrieval techniques, attention and general cognitive speed arc trained in a group of 10 memory-impaired patients. After the 12-week treatment period a postintervention assessment is conducted in the same order as the preintervention assessment to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. The data of a first evaluating study limited by sample size (20 patients) reveal that this intervention effects in a positive way the patient's cognitive performance. Patients with MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) show significant improvement in attention, general cognitive speed and short-term memory. Even patients with a dementia-diagnosis appeare to benefit from the cognitive stimulating intervention: After a 12-week time period no deterioration of cognitive ability is observed. Besides in attention, general cognitive speed and short-term memory an improvement can be reported.","1611":"The aim is to describe and analyse the concepts of multimodal clinical work and the impact of changing patient trends on clinical work practices in our Psychogeriatric Day Hospital since it opened in 1986. Day hospital statistics concerning length of stay, referral rates and readmission over the years were analysed. In two evaluation studies, client satisfaction and daily living activities were assessed. There is firm evidence for the effectiveness of day hospital treatment, as demonstrated by the results of the evaluation studies. In the last two years the average length of day hospital stay reduced significantly, while referrals for day hospital treatment increased rapidly. Despite these changes, the number of staff has stayed the same from 1986 to now. For day hospital intervention to remain effective in the light of changing patients trends, adequate time needs to be given for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including psycho-educational work with patients' family members. This is not only a question of cost-effectiveness, but also an ethical approach bearing in mind future trends towards an increasingly aging population where demand will increase for this type of provision.

From July 1996 to March 2001 23037 patients were admitted and 1618 cases of aggressive behaviour were documented. About 75% of the patients were males, more than 50% were treated involuntarily. The aggressions were most frequently directed against the nursing staff, severe injuries occurred very rarely. We tried to analyse triggers and the individual motivations of aggressive behaviour. Countermeasures were often aggressive as well (reinforced medication, restraint e.g.). The results are discussed in the context of the literature, approaches to cope with and to reduce aggressions are mentioned briefly.","1614":"The preliminary results of a 2-year study of aggressive behaviour in psychiatric patients with an additional learning impairment or mental retardation in a specialized department of a psychiatric hospital are introduced. The study is concerned about the correlation between aggressive behaviour and different factors, as quality of life, number of patients in the ward, age, duration of stay, self-assessment and assessment by the CGI on admission.","1615":"Electrodermal hypoactivity is a known phenomenon in depression. For different reasons a hyperactive electrodermal system should be more likely in allergic persons because of the known hyperreactivity both to psychological and immunological stimuli. Hypothesis of this study therefore was that this higher activity should also be seen in comorbid allergic depressed and anxious patients in comparison to non-allergic depressive patients. In a two-factorial variance analytic design (factor 1: anxiety\/depression and anxiety\/depression versus factor 2: allergy\/non-allergy) we examined 45 age matched female depressed (D) and comorbid anxious (DA) inpatients of the Weissenau Depression Ward and female patients with anxiety\/panic disorders (A) in a Budapest outpatient clinic. Besides measurement of electrodermal parameters (SCL, SFL, amplitude) patients filled in questionnaires (BDI, STAIG, B-L and a questionnaire regarding allergy). Results show no interaction between allergy and depression, but the three diagnostically groups differentiate as would be expected in BDI (p = 0.0038) with highest scores in DA; in all groups depression scores are highest in allergic patients (p = 0.07). Additionally in all diagnostic groups allergic patients had significantly higher electrodermal activity (SCL, p = 0.005) than non-allergic patients. Significant highest electrodermal activity were measured in the depressed group (D, p = 0.026) and not as we would have expected in the comorbid group DA. The implications for diagnostic-therapeutic strategies are discussed.","1616":"Sixty-eight depressive inpatients were subdivided into an acutely suicidal (n = 34) and a non-suicidal control group (n = 34) by means of item I of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The two groups were matched in age and sex. Electrodermal activity (SCL, SFL, SCR, habituation speed) and heart rate (HR) were recorded in a standard habituation experiment. In self-assessment scales, depression (BDI), trait anxiety (STAI-X1) and bodily complaints (B-L') were evaluated. Assuming a correlation between EDA and serotonergic transmission, we expected clear evidence of serotonergic dysfunction in the acutely suicidal group according to the hypothesis of a deficiency in serotonergic transmission in acutely suicidal depressives. Acutely suicidal depressives showed significantly higher depression and anxiety symptoms as well as more physical complaints (compared to the controls). As for the EDA experiments, SCLs and amplitudes of the first EDRs were significantly reduced in the acutely suicidal depressives (in comparison with the controls), whereas their heart rate was increased. Although the subjects of both groups were not selected regarding suicidality or suicidal attempts in their case history before admission to the depression ward but only for suicidality at the time of the experiment, these results are similar to those of depressive patients we examined during inpatient treatment and who later committed violent suicide. Further research on the mechanisms of central serotonergic regulation are necessary to shed light on the question whether acute serotonergic dysfunctions or outlasting deficiencies significantly contribute to results as found in this study.","1617":"In-patient suicide research in Germany during the 70th and 80th years of the last century found an overall increase of in-patient suicides in psychiatric hospitals. Nowadays, more differentiated discussions of the problem are recommended.","1618":"We report results of a study on suicides 1976-1998 of inpatient of the state Mental Hospital Bayreuth.

Data of 212 patients (66% men, median age 51 years, ages from 7 to 88 years) were collected and evaluated. In over 40% of the cases the symptoms had persisted for more than 5 years. The most common main diagnoses were: obstructive sleep apnea (34%), psychophysiological insomnia (21%), restless-legs-syndrome including periodic leg movement in sleep (15%) and sleeping disorders in the context of affective disorders (8.5%). After ambulatory diagnostics 56% were referred to the sleep laboratory within the same hospital, 5% were referred to other sleep laboratories, 22% were treated on an outpatient basis, 7.5% received somatic or psychiatric treatment and only 7% of the patients did not need further treatment. Therefore the function of an outpatient sleep clinic as a filter for further treatment can be proven.","1621":"A lightly modified version of the basic documentation of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Associations was introduced in three different clinics. Relevant items were analysed for about 5300 patients. The data of the 3 clinics were compared.

In two prospective cohorts (183 patients) the conservative multimodal inpatient treatment was examined, using the newly developed \"Radicular Low Back Pain Score\" for the standardized measurement of the radiculopathy. In another sample of 116 patients the preceding outpatient treatment was documented. A significant short-term improvement with regard to the pain intensity and the radiculopathy was observed after approximately two weeks of therapy. The preceding outpatient treatment did not comply with recent guidelines. Moreover, it did not influence the outcome of the multimodal inpatient therapy. The \"Radicular Low Back Pain Score\" seems to be a suitable instrument for measuring therapy effectiveness. Multimodal medical treatment is an important treatment approach for sciatica, especially after failed outpatient therapy. ","1624":"Test results (raw scores) are composed of an unknown true score and an error term. The error term can be estimated by means of test reliability which is defined by the ratio of true variance and obtained variance. Different estimates of reliability either based on single measurements (e.g. Cronbach's coefficient, split half reliability, Kuder Richardson method) or two measurements (test\/retest, inter- or intrarater reliability) are available. Parallel test reliability depends on the correlation of two different tests obtained in one session. Canonical correlation methods allow an extension of the parallel test situation and split half technique. Two or more tests are performed in a sample of subjects. Randomized subsets are correlated using canonical correlation technique. The objective of this study is to estimate the homogeneity of test batteries. 94 patients (64 f, 30 m; age: 54-89 ys.) supposed to have dementia were tested using the clocktest (CT, scores: 1-5), MMSE (mini mental state examination) and SKT (Syndrom Kurztest). Four (i, j: 1-4) subsets of 20 patients each were determined by random and the following characteristics were calculated: Empiric correlation coefficient for n = 94 (R), canonical correlation coefficient (Rcan), eigenvalues (EV) and redundancy (Rnd) of corresponding variable sets. The results of canonical analysis showed canonical correlation coefficients in order of 0.8 to 0.9 (p-values &lt; 0.001). This high internal consistency can be interpreted as a measure of reliability of the test batteries. In conclusion, canonical correlation based on parallel tests splitted in subsets gives information on consistency, i.e. reliability, of test batteries in addition to conventional correlation methods.","1625":"According to a study in two clinics in the region of \"Oberfranken\" (1997) employment or unemployment has a different effect on the development of the mental illness: According to therapist inside opinion women suffered more from paid employment, men, however, from unemployment. In comparisons between the different diagnosis groups comparatively unfavourable effects of unemployment on the development of the illness of, addicted people became evident, negative effects of paid employment, however, were particularly found with patients suffering from F4 disorders (ICD-10).","1626":"Preference on separate or mixed sex treatment should be evaluated from the viewpoint of patients of a psychiatric hospital. The preference of patients were surveyed by questionnaire before and after mixing four single sex wards. The adjusted response rate was 74.5%. About 75% of psychiatric patients prefer a mixed sex ward, about 25% prefer a single sex ward. Females more frequently confirm the type of ward to whom they were actually allocated. By contrast, males are in favour for mixed sex wards independently of the presently experienced type of ward. Younger patients, voluntarily admitted patients, and patients with substance addiction prefer mixed sex wards. After mixing the sexes of formerly single sex wards a significant increase in preference of mixed sex wards was found, due to increased affirmation by female patients. If single sex wards can be established in a psychiatric hospital considering their size, specialisation of wards, and sector of care, patients are enabled to choose between a single and mixed sex ward at admission. ","1627":"As of 1.1.2002 a new documentation system (AmBADO) has been introduced to the out-patient departments of all Bavarian psychiatric clinics. With the use of this new system, practitioners are for the first time allowed to collect data concerning structure, process, and outcome parameters in this field of care. A pilot study was conducted in 2000 before statewide introduction; this occurred at the \"Atriumhaus\", a psychiatric crisis- and treatment centre in Munich. Experiences gathered in this study will be presented and examples for possible benefits of using the new system will be discussed.","1628":"We describe the results of a survey about therapeutic standards in German and Swiss depression treatment units.","1629":"Patients are mostly passive utilizer of the health-care-system. They are confronted with a supply of medical service and they are allowed to show their satisfaction with it retrospectively. Our medical system has in future to develop itself from an effective perspective to an utilizer orientated medicine. Orientation to the utilizers means to ask for the expectations of the patients for supply (at customer's option). Aim of our investigation was to check the subjective expectations of the patients before the beginning of in-patient treatment: 1. What is their opinion about the label of the disorder, they are suffering. 2. Of what therapeutic measures do they expect help for theirselves. 3. Do they want to play a part in planning of therapeutic measures. 209 of 344 (61%) of the patients were at admission ready for answering a self designed questionnaire. Only 4% of the patients said, that their disorder is called insanity. They preferred labels like mental illness (45%), somatic illness (43%) and mental health problem (42%). A pharmacological therapy expected in totally 61% of the patients. Mostly were expected drugs against depressive disorders (32%), drugs against addiction (31%) and tranquilizers (29%). Only 10% of the patients expected to get antipsychotic drugs. A verbal therapeutic intervention expected 76% of the patients. To have a speak with the doctor is with 69% a first rank desire, followed by speaking with the psychologist (60%), the nurses (58%) and the patients comrades (56%). Psychotherapy in a narrower sense expect only 40% of the patients. Furthermore there are privacy and recreation through promenades in front of the expectations (69%), followed by relaxation (59%), occupational therapy (55%) and sports or active exercise therapy (54%). 75% of the patients want to be informed about the therapy. 69% want to cooperate with planning of the therapy. Only 21% commit the therapy to the doctor. About one third of the patients expect a consultation with their relatives, the custodians and their family doctor.","1630":"The study aimed at comparing burnout in staff members at residential drug and alcohol detoxification wards with and without teamsupervision. 4 times in a period of 18 month all staff members (n = 44) were assessed for burnout using a german version (Checkliste Burnoutmerkmale) of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI, Maslach u. Jackson 1986) to asses the severity and the CBE (Checkliste Burnoutentstehungsmerkmale) for associated burnout risc-factors. There was no statistical differences between the mean scores of the 3 different wards due to extreme SDs. The interpersonal differences among staff on the 4 occasions were remarkably. On repeated measurements the intraindividual changes were high. Higher scores were correlated with high workload (seen as frequent admissions). Work-related variables (admissions) turned out to be of more importance than supervision in times of chronic staff-shortage. ","1631":"70-80% of regular smokers fulfill the ICD-10-criteria of dependence. In Germany, approximately 120,000 deaths per year are caused by tobacco-associated diseases. In contrast, therapeutic interventions, such as nicotine substitution or bupropione, yield poor abstinence rates of 30% after 12 months, at best. In animal experiments, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) exhibited modulatory effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission in regions of the so-called reward system. This pilot study should evaluate, if rTMS could modulate subjective craving for tobacco, which quite often leads to relapse to smoking. Therefore, 11 tobacco-dependent cigarette smokers were randomly assigned to a course of verum- and placebo-rTMS on consecutive days. Craving, as measured by a visual analogue scale, is significantly decreased after Verumstimulation compared to placebo-stimulation intra-individually. This encourages further studies to clarify, if rTMS might be helpful in achieving higher tobacco abstinence rates in smokers willing to quits.","1632":"Relapse prevention plays an important role in the treatment of alcoholics. Positive predictors are high self-efficacy and confidence in high-risk situations, positive outcome expectancies, sufficient coping-skills and low craving. We examined 64 primary German alcoholics. Each person met the criteria of alcohol dependence of DSM-IV and ICD-10. Subjects were included in an in-patient 4-step relapse prevention program. This manual-guided group psychotherapy is based on cognitive-behavioral approach focused on high-risk situations, phases of relapse, stress\/relax and resources. Craving before and after treatment did not differ, so that using this kind of relapse prevention training might be suitable in both in- and out-patient programs. High values for insight, optimism, self-efficacy and confidence in high-risk situations might enhance individual coping-skills to balance patient's lifestyle focussing on an abstinent way of life.","1633":"Methadon maintenance therapy with opiate addicts who suffer from a comorbid schizophrenia in an outpatient treatment setting of a psychiatric hospital is described. We examined five patients looking for periods of inpatient treatment, drug free urine tests, social integration and illegal activities before and after neuroleptic treatment. In comparison with standard neuroleptics patients show under the therapy with atypical neuroleptics better outcome in drug urine tests especially concerning cannabis and benzodiazepines. According to these findings, the best improvements seem to occur with a combination of methadone and clozapine.","1634":"To improve reliability of diagnosis of a specific subgroup of chronic alcoholics with multiple impairments (CMA), operational criteria have been proposed. To evaluate usability and sensitivity vs. specificity, all in-patients fulfilling ICD-10 criteria of alcohol dependence were screened on two randomly chosen dates. Two clinically \"extreme\" groups were extracted: patients in a 8-week short-term residential treatment vs. patients in a residential program specifically designed for chronic alcoholics with severe somatic, psychic and\/or social consequences. More quantitative operational criteria, such as \"treatment experience\" and \"consumptive behaviour\" revealed much lower discriminative power than more qualitative criteria, such as \"comorbidity\" and \"social and legal status\". Substantially revised and simplified operational criteria exhibited comparable sensitivity and specificity for the classification of chronic alcoholics with multiple impairments (CMA).","1635":"Schizophrenic disorders as well as neuroleptic treatment can affect locomotion. The study assessed the influence of neuroleptic treatment on human gait via ultrasonic topometric gait analysis. In a control sample the test system proved high test-retest-reliability. Spatial and temporal gait parameters were assessed in schizophrenic patients without neuroleptic treatment (n = 12) and under treatment with conventional neuroleptics (n = 14) and re-assessed after treatment change to the atypical neuroleptic olanzapine in a repeated measures design. After switch from conventional neuroleptics to olanzapine patients showed an increase of gait velocity (p &lt; or = 0.01) and step length (p &lt; or = 0.01) whereas the cadence remained stable. Significant differences between the untreated state and treatment with olanzapine were not detectable. We conclude that bipedal gait is affected by conventional neuroleptic treatment. The degree of impairment can be objectively measured by testing spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters via three-dimensional ultrasonic gait analysis.","1636":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of atypical antipsychotics on cognitive function in schizophrenic patients under clinical routine conditions. Schizophrenic patients (n = 78) were evaluated on neuropsychological tests of attention, short-term- and working memory, learning, long-term memory (retention) and executive function. Data were analyzed according to medication, severity of illness and age. We observed that treatment with atypical antipsychotics compared to conventional neuroleptics was significantly associated with a more favorable effect on cognitive function. Especially in short-term memory and retention a clear advantage of atypical antipsychotics could be seen. Results from this study suggest that even under clinical routine conditions atypical antipsychotics have an advantage on cognitive function when compared with conventional neuroleptics. ","1637":"The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of antidepressants on psychomotor function related to car driving abilities. Depressive inpatients (n = 64) were investigated under steady state plasma level conditions. Data were collected with the ART 90 (Act and React Testsystem) measuring visual perception, reactivity, stress tolerance, selective attention and vigilance and were analyzed according to medication, severity of illness and age. Only 23.8% of the sample reached the criteria of at least 15% of normal controls performance. We also observed that treatment with newer antidepressants (n = 31) was altogether associated with a better performance than treatment with tricyclics (n = 33). These findings have important implications for a systematic examination of driving ability in depressive patients and data show that newer antidepressants may have more salutary effects on psychomotor function than tricyclic antidepressants. ","1638":"Elevations in prolactin plasma concentration occur with antipsychotics due to their dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Hyperprolactinemia may be associated with both acute (galactorrhea, amenorrhea, decreased libido etc.) and chronic (predisposition to osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease) treatment emergent effects in both men and women associated with apparently impaired compliance. The aim of our study was to investigate these supposed effects regarding clinically relevant endocrinologic symptoms under routine treatment conditions with newer, atypical antipsychotics. Our findings confirm that amisulpride frequently leads to a remarkable elevation of prolactin plasma concentration, same--in minor degree--for risperidone. Under treatment with quetiapine and olanzapine just temporary elevated prolactin levels were registered. However, no correlation between prolactin levels and dosage could be found. In females treated with amisulpride acute hormonal side effects were seen in a clinically relevant manner. Features of illness itself, stress factors, concomitant medication or other patient's conditions are supposed to be relevant factors for acute endocrine symptomatology.","1639":"The efficacy of flupentixol and risperidone were compared in a randomized double-blind study in 153 chronic schizophrenic patients. Flupentixol showed to be not inferior to risperidone concerning schizophrenic negative symptoms at week 8, 16 and 24. Positive symptoms and general psychopathology improved comparably, too. There was a trend in favor of flupentixol concerning the improvement of depressive symptoms and a trend in favor of risperidone concerning the improvement of preexisting parkinsonian symptoms. The study data justify to regard flupentixol as a \"partial atypical\" antipsychotic.","1640":"This review summarizes results of cost-utility analyses done with newer versus older antidepressants as well as atypical versus conventional\/typical neuroleptics\/antipsychotics. Following descriptions of the methodological priniciples, the currently available studies (stimulation models) are presented and discussed critically. It can be stated that the economic value of different antidepressants and the atypical neuroleptics can not be decided definitively at the present time due to methodological reasons (e.g. lacking of randomized prospective studies). Increased quality of life of patients and their family seems true for the newer psychotropics, measurement is difficult, however, and a challenge for social and ethical discussions.","1641":"In this paper we discuss two cases of PTSD of policemen according to their occupational duties.","1642":"Stressing live events can lead to serious deficits of emotional and social function and decrease in vitality. Depressive mood, anxiety and a considerable reduction in the mastering of daily live activities are symptoms of these disorders. Social medical and economical consequences can be reduced by early diagnosis of left performance and psychotherapeutic interventions. The example of a 41 year old man with adjustment disorder after an embolic brain injury shows how diagnosis of performance, and special psychotherapeutic treatment allowed the reintegration on the labour market.","1643":"While for some diseases with hyperthyreosis psychotic developments are well known, for a rare autoimmune thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, only one case of development of psychotic symptoms is known. In this case-study we present a 42-year-old white female who was admitted to hospital showing symptoms of acute psychosis. The results of the laboratory examinations showed the constellation of beginning Hashimoto's thyroiditis in hyperthyreotic state with high level of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies and comparatively low level of anti-TSH receptor antibodies. The patient recovered well in 4-weeks time under therapy with neuroleptics and benzodiazepines.","1644":"The concept of frontotemporal lobar degeneration comprises a heterogenous group of cortical dementias, including frontotemporal dementia, as the major clinical variant. Because of their highly variable clinical presentation, to establish the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia could be a diagnostic challenge for the clinician. Here we report a 53 years old caucasian male patient who was admitted for hospitalization due to acute severe schizophrenia-like symptoms. The leading symptomatology comprised acoustic and bizarre optical hallucinations with euphoria and self-overestimation. Remission of the psychotic symptoms demasked the clinical picture of a rapidly progressive frontotemporal dementia with marked apathy, indifference, emotional blunting, loss of insight, change of personality and typical cognitive impairment. The diagnosis was supported by the results of cerebral MRI and FDG-18 PET. This first clinical manifestation of a schizophrenia-like syndrome in the 6th life decade implicates frontotemporal dementia as an important differential diagnosis of schizophrenic disorders in late life. In addition of basically thinking about frontotemporal dementia, a detailed medical history, cognitive testing, neuroimaging and eventually the evaluation of the further disease course are necessary to establish a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.","1645":"A case study based on the clinical picture and the short term course we describe diagnostic problems in a case of Morbus Pick.","1646":"Affective disorders and impulsivity are quite common when using anabolic substances, in this case-study one of the rather rare cases of a psychotic disorder following the abuse of androgenic steroids is described. A 30-year old formerly healthy white male was admitted as inpatient to psychiatric hospital showing symptoms of anxiety and paranoid ideation. In the last 1.5 years he had consumed androgenic steroids, directly before the onset of the first psychotic symptoms 8 weeks before admission he had received an i.m.-injection of nandrolone. Under therapy with neuroleptics the patient recovered completely within 2 months.","1647":"We report the rare case of a 19-year old man, first diagnosed with schizophrenia but finally shown to have subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Initial symptoms were hallucinations and negative symptoms until the onset of a seizure. Changes in the CSF, MRI, EEG and increasing neurological symptoms led to the correct diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The EEG results were of particular importance as they already showed the characteristic changes, even while the patient still only presented with psychotic symptoms. This case report demonstrates the importance of ongoing neurological examinations in patients with psychiatric disorders. In the literature, there are only three case reports about children (8, 9 and 10 year old) as well as one of a 21-year old women with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis presenting with psychosis.","1648":"","1649":"We report the case of a 62-year-old woman with parkinson's disease and depression. Her symptoms included episodes of flushing, palpitations and hypertension, giving rise to the suspicion of the existence of a phaeochromocytoma. The levels of adrenaline and vanillymandelic acid in the urine were moderately elevated, the noradrenaline level was high-normal. Upon further examination, there was no evidence of a phaeochromocytoma or a carcinoid tumor. In the literature, there are reports of pseudophaeochromocytoma in patients receiving levodopa. Elevated levels of catecholamins and their metabolites can be caused by the metabolic process of levodopa and levodopa can influence the outcome of laboratory tests. The patient's depression resolved and the flushing disappeared after treatment with antidepressants and after changing the Parkinson regime.","1650":"","1651":"The total number per month of prescribed antibiotics or psychiatric drugs during one year (1998) was assessed by means of sine wave models [Y(t) = M + A x sin(2 x pi x t\/tau + Phi)]. M (no. of prescriptions per month) denotes mean frequency over one period, A (no. per month) denotes amplitude, tau (month) corresponds to the period and Phi (month) to the phase of the fitted curve. Data were evaluated descriptively and chronograms including 95 %-confidence limits were given. Significant nonlinear regression models could be calculated for amoxicillin, paroxetine, citalopram, amitriptyline and buspirone prescription behaviour. Both circannual and ultra-annual (period shorter than one year) rhythms of prescription were found. Peak values for antibiotic drug prescription during fall and winter is probably associated with higher incidence of infectious diseases. Antidepressant drug prescription has maxima in spring and fall, which is in keeping with the epidemiology of depressive disorders. The seasonality of buspirone prescription may reflect a basic periodicity of anxiety disorders. In conclusion, the chronopharmaco-epidemiological data of antibiotic and antidepressant drug prescription with circannual and ultra-annual rhythms may reflect the periodicity of infectious and psychiatric diseases.","1652":"\"Psychopathy\" describes a type of personality disorder characterized by a dysregulation of emotion processing. Social behaviour, emotion regulation and competency are of particular relevance in forensic psychiatry. Structural-morphological and functional imaging studies prove that emotion regulation, aggressive-impulsive behaviour and learning from negative experiences are greatly influenced by frontal brain regions. These abilities are impaired in severe cases of dissocial personality disorders and in traumatic \"pseudopsychopathy\". We illustrate the importance functional neurobiological changes in patients personality disorders and \"acquired psychopathy\" by two case reports on patients who were admitted to a forensic-psychiatric facility for sexual crimes.","1653":null,"1654":"Recently, a putative functional polymorphism (- 141C Ins\/Del) in the 5'-flanking region of the dopamine D (2) receptor was found. An association of the Ins allele with schizophrenia has been described in a Japanese sample. In the present study this association was examined in a German schizophrenia patient population. In a family based approach 190 German family trios were analyzed for the - 141C Ins\/Del genotype. Using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) we found no evidence for an association of the Ins allele with schizophrenia (TDT = 0.152, P = 0.696). In parallel, we performed an independent case control study with 268 schizophrenic patients and 244 controls. Again, we did not detect an overrepresentation of the Ins allele in patients (P = 0.124). Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that the - 141C Ins variant plays a major role in predisposition to schizophrenia. To confirm our conclusion further preferentially family based studies are needed.","1655":"Two years ago the multiprofessional team of the Memory Centre Erlangen took up its work. Besides complete diagnoses of the cause of memory impairment, the work of the Memory Centre focusses on a special cognitive stimulation intervention. After completing assessment, namely self- and non-self anamnesis, psychometric tests and medical examinations, an individual treatment program for every patient will be development. In most instances the treatment program includes the participation in a special cognitive training. Adapting the SIMA-Program, psychomotor exercises, encoding strategies, retrieval techniques, attention and general cognitive speed arc trained in a group of 10 memory-impaired patients. After the 12-week treatment period a postintervention assessment is conducted in the same order as the preintervention assessment to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. The data of a first evaluating study limited by sample size (20 patients) reveale that this intervention effects in a positive way the patient's cognitive performance. Patients with MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) show significant improvement in attention, general cognitive speed and short-term memory. Even patients with a dementia-diagnosis appeare to benefit from the cognitive stimulating intervention: After a 12-week time period no deterioration of cognitive ability is observed. Besides in attention, general cognitive speed and short-term memory an improvement can be reported.","1656":"OBJECTIVES: The aim is to describe and analyse the concepts of multimodal clinical work and the impact of changing patient trends on clinical work practices in our Psychogeriatric Day Hospital since it opened in 1986. METHOD: Day hospital statistics concerning length of stay, referral rates and readmission over the years were analysed. In two evaluation studies, client satisfaction and daily living activities were assessed. RESULTS: There is firm evidence for the effectiveness of day hospital treatment, as demonstrated by the results of the evaluation studies. In the last two years the average length of day hospital stay reduced significantly, while referrals for day hospital treatment increased rapidly. Despite these changes, the number of staff has stayed the same from 1986 to now. CONCLUSION: For day hospital intervention to remain effective in the light of changing patients trends, adequate time needs to be given for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including psycho-educational work with patients' family members. This is not only a question of cost-effectiveness, but also an ethical approach bearing in mind future trends towards an increasingly aging population where demand will increase for this type of provision.","1657":"In the presentations of psychiatric day-hospital-activities was found an often used vocabulary, that reveals the specific conflicts with social politics, administration and indoor\/outdoor services.

From July 1996 to March 2001 23 037 patients were admitted and 1618 cases of aggressive behaviour were documented. About 75 % of the patients were males, more than 50 % were treated involuntarily. The aggressions were most frequently directed against the nursing staff, severe injuries occured very rarely. We tried to analyse triggers and the individual motivations of aggressive behaviour. Countermeasures were often aggressive as well (reinforced medication, restraint e. g.). The results are discussed in the context of the literature, approaches to cope with and to reduce aggressions are mentioned briefly.","1659":"The preliminary results of a 2-year study of aggressive behaviour in psychiatric patients with an additional learning impairment or mental retardation in a specialized department of a psychiatric hospital are introduced. The study is concerned about the correlation between aggressive behaviour and different factors, as quality of life, number of patients in the ward, age, duration of stay, self-assessment and assessment by the CGI on admission.","1660":"Electrodermal hypoactivity is a known phenomenon in depression. For different reasons a hyperactive electrodermal system should be more likely in allergic persons because of the known hyperreactivity both to psychological and immunological stimuli. Hypothesis of this study therefore was that this higher activity should also be seen in comorbid allergic depressed and anxious patients in comparison to non-allergic depressive patients. In a two-factorial variance analytic design (factor 1: anxiety\/depression and anxiety\/depression versus factor 2: allergy\/non-allergy) we examined 45 age matched female depressed (D) and comorbid anxious (DA) inpatients of the Weissenau Depression Ward and female patients with anxiety\/panic disorders (A) in a Budapest outpatient clinic. Besides measurement of electrodermal parameters (SCL, SFL, amplitude) patients filled in questionnaires (BDI, STAIG, B-L and a questionnaire regarding allergy). Results show no interaction between allergy and depression, but the three diagnostically groups differentiate as would be expected in BDI (p = 0.0038) with highest scores in DA; in all groups depression scores are highest in allergic patients (p = 0.07). Additionally in all diagnostic groups allergic patients had significantly higher electrodermal activity (SCL, p = 0.005) than non-allergic patients. Significant highest electrodermal activity were measured in the depressed group (D, p = 0.026) and not as we would have expected in the comorbid group DA. The implications for diagnostic-therapeutic strategies are discussed.","1661":"Sixty-eight depressive inpatients were subdivided into an acutely suicidal (n = 34) and a non-suicidal control group (n = 34) by means of item I of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The two groups were matched in age and sex. Electrodermal activity (SCL, SFL, SCR, habituation speed) and heart rate (HR) were recorded in a standard habituation experiment. In self-assessment scales, depression (BDI), trait anxiety (STAI-X1) and bodily complaints (B-L') were evaluated. Assuming a correlation between EDA and serotonergic transmission, we expected clear evidence of serotonergic dysfunction in the acutely suicidal group according to the hypothesis of a deficiency in serotonergic transmission in acutely suicidal depressives. Acutely suicidal depressives showed significantly higher depression and anxiety symptoms as well as more physical complaints (compared to the controls). As for the EDA experiments, SCLs and amplitudes of the first EDRs were significantly reduced in the acutely suicidal depressives (in comparison with the controls), whereas their heart rate was increased. Although the subjects of both groups were not selected regarding suicidality or suicidal attempts in their case history before admission to the depression ward but only for suicidality at the time of the experiment, these results are similar to those of depressive patients we examined during inpatient treatment and who later committed violent suicide. Further research on the mechanisms of central serotonergic regulation are necessary to shed light on the question whether acute serotonergic dysfunctions or outlasting deficiencies significantly contribute to results as found in this study.","1662":"In-patient suicide research in Germany during the 70 (th) and 80 (th) years of the last century found an overall increase of in-patient suicides in psychiatric hospitals.

METHODS: In two prospective cohorts (183 patients) the conservative multimodal inpatient treatment was examined, using the newly developed \"Radicular Low Back Pain Score\" for the standardized measurement of the radiculopathy. In another sample of 116 patients the preceeding outpatient treatment was documented. RESULTS: A significant short-term improvement with regard to the pain intensity and the radiculopathy was observed after approximately two weeks of therapy. The preceeding outpatient treatment did not comply with recent guidelines. Moreover, it did not influence the outcome of the multimodal inpatient therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The \"Radicular Low Back Pain Score\" seems to be a suitable instrument for measuring therapy effectiveness. Multimodal medical treatment is an important treatment approach for sciatica, especially after failed outpatient therapy.","1669":"Test results (raw scores) are composed of an unknown true score and an error term. The error term can be estimated by means of test reliability which is defined by the ratio of true variance and obtained variance. Different estimates of reliability either based on single measurements (e. g. Cronbach's coefficient, split half reliability, Kuder Richardson method) or two measurements (test\/retest, inter- or intrarater reliability) are available. Parallel test reliability depends on the correlation of two different tests obtained in one session. Canonical correlation methods allow an extension of the parallel test situation and split half technique. Two or more tests are performed in a sample of subjects. Randomized subsets are correlated using canonical correlation technique. The objective of this study is to estimate the homogeneity of test batteries. 94 patients (64 f, 30 m; age: 54 - 89 ys.) supposed to have dementia were tested using the clocktest (CT, scores: 1 - 5), MMSE (mini mental state examination) and SKT (Syndrom Kurztest). Four (i, j: 1 - 4) subsets of 20 patients each were determined by random and the following characteristics were calculated: Empiric correlation coefficient for n = 94 (R), canonical correlation coefficient (Rcan), eigenvalues (EV) and redundancy (Rnd) of corresponding variable sets. The results of canonical analysis showed canonical correlation coefficients in order of 0.8 to 0.9 (p-values &lt; 0,001). This high internal consistency can be interpreted as a measure of reliability of the test batteries. In conclusion, canonical correlation based on parallel tests splitted in subsets gives information on consistency, i. e. reliability, of test batteries in addition to conventional correlation methods.","1670":"According to a study in two clinics in the region of \"Oberfranken\" (1997) employment or unemployment has a different effect on the development of the mental illness: According to therapist inside opinion women suffered more from paid employment, men, however, from unemployment. In comparisons between the different diagnosis groups comparatively unfavourable effects of unemployment on the development of the illness of addicted people became evident, negative effects of paid employment, however, were particularly found with patients suffering from F4 disorders (ICD-10).","1671":"OBJECTIVE: Preference on separate or mixed sex treatment should be evaluated from the viewpoint of patients of a psychiatric hospital. METHODS: The preference of patients were surveyed by questionnaire before and after mixing four single sex wards. The adjusted response rate was 74.5 %. RESULTS: About 75 % of psychiatric patients prefer a mixed sex ward, about 25 % prefer a single sex ward. Females more frequently confirm the type of ward to whom they were actually allocated. By contrast, males are in favour for mixed sex wards independently of the presently experienced type of ward. Younger patients, voluntarily admitted patients, and patients with substance addiction prefer mixed sex wards. After mixing the sexes of formerly single sex wards a significant increase in preference of mixed sex wards was found, due to increased affirmation by female patients. CONCLUSION: If single sex wards can be established in a psychiatric hospital considering their size, specialisation of wards, and sector of care, patients are enabled to choose between a single and mixed sex ward at admission.","1672":"As of 1.1.2002 a new documentation system (AmBADO) has been introduced to the out-patient departments of all Bavarian psychiatric clinics. With the use of this new system, practitioners are for the first time allowed to collect data concerning structure, process, and outcome parameters in this field of care. A pilot study was conducted in 2000 before statewide introduction; this occurred at the \"Atriumhaus\", a psychiatric crisis- and treatment centre in Munich. Experiences gathered in this study will be presented and examples for possible benefits of using the new system will be discussed.","1673":"We describe the results of a survey about therapeutic standards in German and Swiss depression treatment units.","1674":"Patiens are mostly passive utilizer of the health-care-system. They are confronted with a supply of medical service and they are allowed to show their satisfaction with it retrospectively. Our medical system has in future to develope itself from an effective perspective to an utilizer orientated medicine. Orientation to the utilizers means to ask for the expectations of the patients for supply (at customer's option). Aim of our investigation was to check the subjective expectations of the patients before the beginning of in-patient treatment: 1. What is their opinion about the label of the disorder, they are suffering. 2. Of what therapeutic measures do they expect help for theirselves. 3. Do they want to play a part in planning of therapeutic measures. 209 of 344 (61 %) of the patients were at admission ready for answering a self designed questionnaire. Only 4 % of the patients said, that their disorder is called insanity. They preferred labels like mental illness (45 %), somatic illness (43 %) and mental health problem (42 %). A pharmacological therapy expected in totally 61 % of the patients. Mostly were expected drugs against depressive disorders (32 %), drugs against addiction (31 %) and tranquilizers (29 %). Only 10 % of the patients expected to get antipsychotic drugs. A verbal therapeutic intervention expected 76 % of the patients. To have a speak with the doctor is with 69 % a first rank desire, followed by speaking with the psychologist (60 %), the nurses (58 %) and the patients comrades (56 %). Psychotherapy in a narrower sense expect only 40 % of the patients. Furthermore there are privacy and recreation throug promenades in front of the expectations (69 %), followed by relaxation (59 %), occupational therapy (55 %) and sports or acitive exercise therapy (54 %). 75 % of the patients want to be informed about the therapy. 69 % want to cooperate with planning of the therapy. Only 21 % commit the therapy to the doctor. About one third of the patients expect a consultation with their relatives, the custodians and their family doctor.","1675":"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed at comparing burnout in staff members at residential drug and alcohol detoxification wards with and without teamsupervision. METHOD: 4 times in a period of 18 month all staff members (n = 44) were assessed for burnout using a german version (Checkliste Burnoutmerkmale) of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI, Maslach u. Jackson 1986) to asses the severity and the CBE (Checkliste Burnoutentstehungsmerkmale) for associated burnout risc-factors. RESULT: There was no statistical differences between the mean scores of the 3 different wards due to extreme SDs. The interpersonal differences among staff on the 4 occasions were remarkably. On repeated measurements the intraindividual changes were high. Higher scores were correlated with high workload (seen as frequent admissions). CONCLUSION: Work-related variables (admissions) turned out to be of more importance than supervision in times of chronic staff-shortage.","1676":"70 - 80 % of regular smokers fulfill the ICD-10-criteria of dependence. In Germany, approximately 120 000 deaths per year are caused by tobacco-associated diseases. In contrast, therapeutic interventions, such as nicotine substitution or bupropione, yield poor abstinence rates of 30 % after 12 months, at best. In animal experiments, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) exhibited modulatory effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission in regions of the so-called reward system. This pilot study should evaluate, if rTMS could modulate subjective craving for tobacco, which quite often leads to relapse to smoking. Therefore, 11 tobacco-dependent cigarette smokers were randomly assigned to a course of verum- and placebo-rTMS on consecutive days. Craving, as measured by a visual analogue scale, is significantly decreased after Verumstimulation compared to placebostimulation intra-individually. This encourages further studies to clarify, if rTMS might be helpful in achieving higher tobacco abstinence rates in smokers willing to quits.","1677":"Relapse prevention plays an important role in the treatment of alcoholics. Positive predictors are high self-efficacy and confidence in high-risk situations, positive outcome expectancies, sufficient coping-skills and low craving. We examined 64 primary German alcoholics. Each person met the criteria of alcohol dependence of DSM-IV and ICD-10. Subjects were included in an in-patient 4-step relapse prevention program. This manual-guided group psychotherapy is based on cognitive-behavioral approach focused on high-risk situations, phases of relapse, stress\/relax and resources. Craving before and after treatment did not differ, so that using this kind of relapse prevention training might be suitable in both in- and out-patient programs. High values for insight, optimism, self-efficacy and confidence in high-risk situations might enhance individual coping-skills to balance patient's lifestyle focussing on an abstinent way of life.","1678":"Methadon maintenance therapy with opiate addicts who suffer from a comorbid schizophrenia in an outpatient treatment setting of a psychiatric hospital is described. We examined five patients looking for periods of inpatient treatment, drug free urine tests, social integration and illegal activities before and after neuroleptic treatment. In comparison with standard neuroleptics patients show under the therapy with atypical neuroleptics better outcome in drug urine tests especially concerning cannabis and benzodiazepines. According to these findings, the best improvements seem to occur with a combination of methadone and clozapine.","1679":"To improve reliability of diagnosis of a specific subgroup of chronic alcoholics with multiple impairments (CMA), operational criteria have been proposed. To evaluate usability and sensitivity vs. specifity, all in-patients fulfilling ICD-10 criteria of alcohol dependence were screened on two randomly chosen dates. Two clinically \"extreme\" groups were extracted: patients in a 8-week short-term residential treatment vs. patients in a residential program specifically designed for chronic alcoholics with severe somatic, psychic and\/or social consequences. More quantitative operational criteria, such as \"treatment experience\" and \"consumptive behaviour\" revealed much lower discriminative power than more qualitative criteria, such as \"comorbidity\" and \"social and legal status\". Substantially revised and simplified operational criteria exhibited comparable sensitivity and specifity for the classification of chronic alcoholics with multiple impairments (CMA).","1680":"Schizophrenic disorders as well as neuroleptic treatment can affect locomotion. The study assessed the influence of neuroleptic treatment on human gait via ultrasonic topometric gait analysis. In a control sample the test system proved high test-retest-reliability. Spatial and temporal gait parameters were assessed in schizophrenic patients without neuroleptic treatment (n = 12) and under treatment with conventional neuroleptics (n = 14) and re-assessed after treatment change to the atypical neuroleptic olanzapine in a repeated measures design. After switch from conventional neuroleptics to olanzapine patients showed an increase of gait velocity (p &lt;\/= 0.01) and step length (p &lt;\/= 0.01) whereas the cadence remained stable. Significant differences between the untreated state and treatment with olanzapine were not detectable. We conclude that bipedal gait is affected by conventional neuroleptic treatment. The degree of impairment can be objectively measured by testing spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters via three-dimensional ultrasonic gait analysis.","1681":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of atypical antipsychotics on cognitive function in schizophrenic patients under clinical routine conditions. METHOD: Schizophrenic patients (n = 78) were evaluated on neuropsychological tests of attention, short-term- and working memory, learning, long-term memory (retention) and executive function. Data were analyzed according to medication, severity of illness and age. RESULTS: We observed that treatment with atypical antipsychotics compared to conventional neuroleptics was significantly associated with a more favorable effect on cognitive function. Especially in short-term memory and retention a clear advantage of atypical antipsychotics could be seen. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that even under clinical routine conditions atypical antipsychotics have an advantage on cognitive function when compared with conventional neuroleptics.","1682":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of antidepressants on psychomotor function related to car driving abilities. METHOD: Depressive inpatients (n = 64) were investigated under steady state plasma level conditions. Data were collected with the ART 90 (Act and React Testsystem) measuring visual perception, reactivity, stress tolerance, selective attention and vigilance and were analyzed according to medication, severity of illness and age. RESULTS: Only 23,8 % of the sample reached the criteria of at least 15 % of normal controls performance. We also observed that treatment with newer antidepressants (n = 31) was altogether associated with a better performance than treatment with tricyclics (n = 33). CONCLUSIONS: These findings have important implications for a systematic examination of driving ability in depressive patients and data show that newer antidepressants may have more salutary effects on psychomotor function than tricyclic antidepressants.","1683":"Elevations in prolactin plasma concentration occur with antipsychotics due to their dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Hyperprolactinemia may be associated with both acute (galactorrhea, amenorrhea, decreased libido etc.) and chronic (predisposition to osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease) treatment emergent effects in both men and women associated with apparently impaired compliance. The aim of our study was to investigate these supposed effects regarding clinically relevant endocrinologic symptoms under routine treatment conditions with newer, atypical antipsychotics. Our findings confirm that amisulpride frequently leads to a remarkable elevation of prolactin plasma concentration, same - in minor degree - for risperidone. Under treatment with quetiapine and olanzapine just temporary elevated prolactin levels were registered. However, no correlation between prolactin levels and dosage could be found. In females treated with amisulpride acute hormonal side effects were seen in a clinically relevant manner. Features of illness itself, stress factors, concomitant medication or other patient's conditions are supposed to be relevant factors for acute endocrine symptomatology.","1684":"The efficacy of flupentixol and risperidone were compared in a randomized double-blind study in 153 chronic schizophrenic patients. Flupentixol showed to be not inferior to risperidone concerning schizophrenic negative symptoms at week 8, 16 and 24. Positive symptoms and general psychopathology improved comparably, too. There was a trend in favor of flupentixol concerning the improvement of depressive symptoms and a trend in favor of risperidone concerning the improvement of preexisting parkinsonian symptoms. The study data justify to regard flupentixol as a \"partial atypical\" antipsychotic.","1685":"This review summarizes results of cost-utility analyses done with newer versus older antidepressants as well as atypical versus conventional\/typical neuroleptics\/antipsychotics. Following descriptions of the methodological principles, the currently available studies (simulation models) are presented and discussed critically. It can be stated that the economic value of different antidepressants and the atypical neuroleptics can not be decided definitively at the present time due to methodological reasons (e. g. lacking of randomized prospective studies). Increased quality of life of patients and their family seems true for the newer psychotropics, measurement is difficult, however, and a challenge for social and ethical discussions.","1686":"In this paper we discuss two cases of PTSD of policemen according to their occupational duties.","1687":"Stressing live events can lead to serious deficits of emotional and social function and decrease in vitality.

Here we report a 53 years old caucasian male patient who was admitted for hospitalization due to acute severe schizophrenia-like symptoms. The leading symptomatology comprised acoustic and bizarre optical hallucinations with euphoria and self-overestimation. Remission of the psychotic symptoms demasked the clinical picture of a rapidly progressive frontotemporal dementia with marked apathy, indifference, emotional blunting, loss of insight, change of personality and typical cognitive impairment. The diagnosis was supported by the results of cerebral MRI and FDG-18 PET. This first clinical manifestation of a schizophrenia-like syndrome in the 6 (th) life decade implicates frontotemporal dementia as an important differential diagnosis of schizophrenic disorders in late life. In addition of basically thinking about frontotemporal dementia, a detailed medical history, cognitive testing, neuroimaging and eventually the evaluation of the further disease course are necessary to establish a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.","1690":"A case study based on the clinical picture and the short term course we describe diagnostic problems in a case of Morbus Pick.","1691":"Affective disorders and impulsivity are quite common when using anabolic substances, in this case-study one of the rather rare cases of a psychotic disorder following the abuse of androgenic steroids is described. A 30-year old formerly healthy white male was admitted as inpatient to psychiatric hospital showing symptoms of anxiety and paranoid ideation. In the last 1,5 years he had consumed androgenic steroids, directly before the onset of the first psychotic symptoms 8 weeks before admission he had received an i. m.-injection of nandrolone. Under therapy with neuroleptics the patient recovered completely within 2 months.","1692":"We report the rare case of a 19-year old man, first diagnosed with schizophrenia but finally shown to have subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Initial symptoms were hallucinations and negative symptoms until the onset of a seizure. Changes in the CSF, MRI, EEG and increasing neurological symptoms led to the correct diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The EEG results were of particular importance as they already showed the characteristic changes, even while the patient still only presented with psychotic symptoms. This case report demonstrates the importance of ongoing neurological examinations in patients with psychiatric disorders. In the literature, there are only three case reports about children (8, 9 and 10 year old) as well as one of a 21-year old women with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis presenting with psychosis.","1693":"We report the case of a 64-year-old woman with a right temporal-parietal meningioma. She presented initially with depressive symptoms but later developed symptoms of acute schizophreniform psychosis. The psychotic symptoms dissapeared after treatment with neuroleptics. The resection of the meningioma led to a lasting remission of the psychotic symptomatology without continued administration of neuroleptics. The correlation between psychotic symptoms and the results of CT scan or MRI is controversial. In this case, the evidence points towards an organic cause of the psychosis rather than an endogenous psychosis.","1694":"We report the case of a 62-year-old woman with parkinson's disease and depression. Her symptoms included episodes of flushing, palpitations and hypertension, giving rise to the suspicion of the existence of a phaeochromocytoma. The levels of adrenaline and vanillymandelic acid in the urine were moderately elevated, the noradrenaline level was high- normal. Upon further examination, there was no evidence of a phaeochromocytoma or a carcinoid tumor. In the literature, there are reports of pseudophaeochromocytoma in patients receiving levodopa. Elevated levels of catecholamins and their metabolites can be caused by the metabolic process of levodopa and levodopa can influence the outcome of laboratory tests. The patient's depression resolved and the flushing disappeared after treatment with antidepressants and after changing the Parkinson regime.","1695":"","1696":"","1697":"There's still no effective treatment established for Tardive Dyskinesia. Aim of the study was to analyse the effect of pergolide, a D1 and D2 receptor agonist with prevalence for presynaptic auto receptors, in oro-facial tardive dyskinesia by means of a double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over study. Low-dose pergolide should activate presynaptic auto receptors, decrease dopamintransmission and reduce tardive dyskinesia. Assessment of dyskinesia was performed with the computer-assisted technique Digital-Imaging-Processing in addition to the clinical scale AIMS (Abnormal-Involuntary-Movement-Scale). 10 patients with oro-facial dyskinesia were examined for alteration to dyskinesia, psychopathology, vital functions and laborchemical parameter. Dyskinesia decreased 25 % for relax and 17 % for task conditions under pergolide treatment. Low-dose pergolide showed no side effects or worsening of the psychopathological state. Results of the Digital-Imaging-Processing correlated significantly with the results of clinical AIMS scale, but the computer-assisted technique gives more detailed information about degree and type of the movement disorder. Results suggest a therapeutic effect of pergolide in tardive dyskinesia, this has to be verified with a larger study population and longer observation. Assessment of dyskinesia is rater independent and more significant with the computer-assisted technique.

Socio-demographic and clinical data as well as the working relationship between patients and psychiatrists were documented. 92 psychiatrists rated 137 crisis consultations. 58 patients were able to answer a questionnaire in the acute crisis situation. The largest diagnostic group consists of patients with affective disorders, followed by patients with neurotic, stress, and somatoform disorders. The results indicate an overall high satisfaction of patients and psychiatrists concerning the efficacy of the crisis consultations. As to be expected from psychotherapy research, socio-demographical factors are hardly of any consequence, whereas relationship-based factors have a considerable influence. Directivity and giving structure on the psychiatrist's part can clearly enhance the patient's confidence.

Therefore, a profound and up-to-date knowledge of vocational outcome predictors is imperative. The objective of the present study was, while minimizing the influence of the instruments used, to generate factors, which predict best the re-integration outcome. In a sample of 76 chronic schizophrenia patients ten relevant factors were derived from a factor analysis including 32 variables. In a second step the predictive value of these ten factors centering on vocational outcome were tested by logistic regression analysis. Participants who had a successful outcome showed a good vocational capacity before and during the two-week assessment phase, had no social deficits and no depressive-resignative coping strategies. Schizophrenia symptoms and cognitive deficits, however, were of minor relevance. The results of our factor-analytic approach confirm earlier findings that vocational functioning observed in a sheltered setting and social competence are the best predictors for successful vocational rehabilitation. Moreover, they serve to substantiate the necessity of developing therapeutic programs that enhance patients' hopefulness and self-confidence.

Differential diagnostic classification of psychotic symptoms in this age group is difficult, especially when disorder criteria are not yet completely met. Differential diagnostic hints which can indicate severe adjustment problems, Borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia as well as specific diagnostic difficulties are presented in this paper.

Personal reflection based on the history of mental health care, own experience and current developments. Mental health care and the relationship between patients and professionals within it have changed significantly in the last five decades. Current developments may be seen as characterised by a) a widening remit of mental health care with an increasing clientele with non-severe mental disorders; b) re-institutionalisation for the severely mentally ill, e.g. with a rising number of forensic beds; and c) a tension between consumer orientation in a post-modern society and dominance of evidence-based medicine. Mental health care has always lived in a balance between social control and therapeutic aspiration. Yet, we now seem to witness a stronger split between the two with re-institutionalisation for patients with severe mental illnesses who might upset the public on one hand, and a growing private market of various treatment options for patients who actively seek treatment and can--directly or indirectly--pay for it on the other. This leads to the anticipation of positive as well as negatives scenarios for the future which are briefly described and contrasted. ","1708":"If one changes the paradigm--what should be changed, what has been changed? Even today, the number of beds at the department head's disposal represents power. Is power the purpose of psychiatry? Rather isn't the purpose the adequate treatment of a mentally impaired persons, about adequate support in a natural environment? In our society, and in particular in psychiatry, the striving for power must be questioned. Our memory of the deportation and the disappearance of mentally ill, of the extermination of \"unworthy life\", of Hartheim, Grafeneck and Brandenburg is still too fresh. It is imperative to convey the idea of a life worth living even then when this seems hopeless to us. Outpatient psychiatric care has bid farewell to outdated conventional structures, which in their time under certain social conditions had proven not to be unreasonable. Outpatient psychiatric care is about the rediscovery of a sense of life that gives reason for hope. Only the joint contemplation of new resources can bring us forward.","1709":"\"Validation\" after Naomi Feil is the name of a method which is used and recognized the world over as an appreciative way of dealing with the highly aged. Validation is based on universally valid humanist principles. A person is viewed as an individual being having a good reason for his current behavior. This is true for \"still oriented\" as well as for \"non-oriented\" persons. It is necessary to recognize and categorize the different behavioral patterns in the various phases of disorientation. Here we speak of the physical and psychological characteristics of the four phases of disorientation. The target group is persons who are just still oriented, but deny their current situation and thus react peculiaryly. The next group is the time and place disoriented persons. Subsequently the group of persons who can express themselves solely by nonverbal means, i.e. repetitive movements, follows. The last group is motionless persons who simply vegetate. In addition, there are suitable verbal and nonverbal techniques that can be used in a most sensible and appreciative way of dealing with these highly aged. The aged persons are not corrected and not oriented according to reality, but are escorted in their world. We call this: \"walking in the shoes of the other person\". It is necessary to take emotions seriously and to share them with others. We do not take position, we do not judge and we also do not offer hasty solutions. We are honest and do not use well-meant lies. The goal of applying validation is on the one hand the relief and improvement of the work situation of family and the people taking care of these aged persons, and on the other hand a noticeable and measurable increase of these highly aged persons welfare and quality of life.","1710":"Is it necessary to understand your vis a vis or is it enough to meet, to get in touch? Awareness of the different perception of reality is important. INTERINDIVIDUELL: Defined as basic requirements for getting in touch, mutual modelling and interchange were \"Knowing your own world\", \"Being curious about the world of the other\", candour and tolerance. Time makes the essential framework. Are the interindividuell parameters also practicable for groups\/organizations? In the psychosocial context the subjective perception of the world is cause and cure at the same time. The basic requirements enable people, by getting in touch, to reorganize themselves.

Over 18 years continuous experience with the pilot project \"Soteria Bern\"--predominantly milieu- and psychotherapeutic treatment of acute schizophrenia--are used as examples. In refurbishing normal psychiatric hospital wards meant for all types of patients, a much less violent therapeutic atmosphere was created through the introduction of \"Soteria-Elements\" as well. In toto it can be shown that a more gentle psychiatry can be realized without greater costs, if the interaction between feeling, thinking and behavior are more fully understood and observed. For this, the concept of \"affect logic\" delivers a theoretic basis that has been proven in practice.","1712":"This article attempts to fertilize the concept of recognition by Axel Honneth for use with mentally handicapped persons. The \"Concept of Recognition\" offers a concept of fairness that is closely tied to the idea of an integrated life style. The development of self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem--as differing levels of practical self-relation--are bound to the experience of inter-subjective acceptance. This represents the basic requirement on which the development of a person's identity depends. Refusal of recognition, and\/or disregard, exclusion, or disgrace negatively effects the integrity of a person. The relevance of the concept of recognition in psychosocial practice is described, this allows mentally handicapped persons to be observed out of the perspective of \"suffering\" as well as out of the perspective of \"acting\". This necessarily requires a biographical and environmental approach. Biography oriented support approaches require continual evaluation of the institutional arrangements that possibly themselves are the source of indignities, disregard and restrictions of autonomy. This analysis however remains incomplete if the social conditions that are responsible for the violation of recognition criteria are not investigated as well.","1713":"Since its beginnings, the ideology of psychiatry has been determined by the paradigm of a disease model. Practically all psychiatric schools are characterized by their orientation towards a morbid, atypical behaviour. This, however, inevitably narrows the view of the soul of a person. Despite mental illness, resources are always present, these though are not recognized and not utilized. The theory of salutogenesis with its search for health preserving factors has significantly expanded insight on dynamic mental processes. The resulting concept of health promotion attempts to develop patient's self-healing powers by identifying healthy parts and supporting them by instructing patients in active participation. From a health promotion viewpoint, it is necessary to intervene at three levels: 1. At the patient level in the form of guidance and help to actively participate in the healing process. 2. At the staff level in the form of creating healthy work conditions and the promotion of active participation in the creation of this work environment. 3. At the level of psychiatric institutions in the form of promoting efficient communications structures within and between the various services. This paper describes the concept of health promotion in psychiatric services and its possible influence on the reshaping of theory and practice in psychiatry--necessary in the face of current challenges.","1714":"As opposed to scientific psychiatry, social psychiatry draws its resources from sociological sources and must continuously adapt its self-image and concept of action to changes in society. Sociological analysis of the present describes dramatic changes in society, which also have consequences for the subject's mastering of everyday routines and formation of identity. As opposed to neo-liberal promises of sheer limitless new opportunities, respectable interpretations of current times describe an ambivalent process that by far does not positively effect all groups in society, and in fact increases the danger of social exclusion. Exclusionary processes particularly affect persons, who do not fulfill the new requirements of hyper flexibility, mobility and allround fitness. Justifiably the question arises whether these requirements themselves induce the destruction of personality. This brings up the question if there is an alternative to the neoliberal view of humankind. This paper picks up the idea of a civil society centered on an individual and recalcitrant subject.","1715":"The frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) after clozapine or olanzapine is low and often of non-serious nature. A 49 year-old female patient developed NMS 12 days after olanzapine re-exposure. Olanzapine was stopped, the patient was transferred to an ICU and received a course of nine uni- and bilateral ECT treatments. This led to remission. 14 months earlier the patient had presented with a first severe NMS episode after haloperidol depot injection and 4 days after starting oral clozapine. Following the first NMS episode olanzapine (20 mg per day) was administered for 11 months without adverse effects.","1716":"In our study we compare 80 schizophrenic inpatients with suicide to a control group matched by age, sex and ICD-9: 295.x. Overall, suicidal behaviour of schizophrenic inpatients seem to be related to psychopathology, knowledge about the disorder and the course and also to side effects of psychopharmacotherapy.","1717":"The purpose of the study was to examine opiate-related deaths in the German town Essen (inhabitants about 600,000) from 1990-1994. Sociodemographic data, psychiatric comorbidity and purity of the used opioids were of focussed interest. 189 opiate-related deaths were analysed during the 5-year period. Patient files and police-related documents were used for the retrospective analysis. Purity of opioids was examined in a criminalistic laboratory and correlated with the number of deaths per time interval. The average age to start drug abuse in this cohort of 189 people was about 20, the average time of drug career was about 8.5 years, and the highest number of drug-related deaths was to be found at the age of 29-30. Purity of opioids was correlated statistically significantly (p &lt; 0.05) with the number of deaths per period of time. After an average start of drug abuse at the age of 20 and a drug career of about a decade the risk of drug-related death seems to be relatively high at the age of about 30 years. Opiate purity seems to be relevant for drug-related death. ","1718":"Following 25 years of psychiatric reform in West and 12 years in East Germany the status of community orientation of German psychiatry is investigated. Analysis of secondary data. Community orientation in hospital care is better realised in the smaller western states and in the eastern German states. In the large western states inpatient care is still dominated by the structures of the large regional hospitals. Outpatient care, dominated by psychiatrists and psychotherapists in private practise, is less densely provided in East Germany. Sheltered accommodation is provided predominantly in hostels. The states with better community orientation in hospital care offer fewer sheltered accommodation. The process of psychiatric reform is not accomplished yet, particularly concerning hospital care in the large western states and sheltered accommodation in general. A possible cause for the weak implementation of community orientation in hospital services in the large western states might be the strong position of hospital responsables that oppose the closing down of hospitals. Incentives for implementing supported housing are weak. The under-serving with sheltered accommodation might pose risks to the persons concerned.

With regard to comorbidity, kleptomania is related to the obsessive- compulsive disorder spectrum and to the broader spectrum of affective disorders. Accordingly a psychopharmacological intervention with anti-depressant drugs or mood stabilizers may be possible, even though there are to date no known results from controlled therapy studies. Nevertheless the successful administration of such medication has been reported in several cases. Assuming a disturbed central serotonin reuptake, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) seems to be indicated. But also naltrexone could be of use in kleptomania.","1726":"For the first time in Switzerland, patients were followed up who had become paraplegic after a suicidal attempt, and who had to spend a certain time in a center for paraplegics (corresponding to 3 % of all traumatically induced cases of myeloparalysis). Records and catamnestic data of patients with paraplegia after suicidal attempt during the years 1982 - 1996 (n = 38)--all being or having been patients of the centers for paraplegics f Basel and Nottwil (canton of Lucerne)--were evaluated. Catamnestic investigations performed from one month to 14 years after the suicidal attempt, based on a structured dialogue with a standardized, computerized questionnaire, led, among others, to the following conclusions: The average age of these patients (20 males and 18 females) was 38 years. The most frequently encountered suicidal method, leading to the paraplegic lesion, was a fall from a window of a building (89,6 %). In 55 % of the cases, psychiatric disease, especially depression, alcohol and drug dependence, had been diagnosed prior to the suicidal attempt. 37 % of patients hat attempted suicide at least once before the attempt leading to the paraplegic condition. 34 % had been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons on an earlier occasion. In 26 %, a farewell letter was written. As far as the level of the paraplegic lesions is concerned, patients were equally distributed (50 % each) between thoracal\/cervical and lumbar lesions. The associated sexual impairment was experienced by each one of the 38 patients as a most disturbing problem. Despite the limited number of cases and the partially short time interval between the suicidal attempt and the follow-up investigation, results seem to indicate that such patients are not likely to commit suicide on a later occasion. One single patient had tried to commit suicide several times after the suicidal attempt event under discussion.","1727":"The social situation of patients with late-onset late-life depression admitted to a gerontopsychiatric day-clinic was assessed with respect to activities, social contacts, living conditions and finances. The patients were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. Relationships of the social situation to life satisfaction and severity of depression were investigated. In the patients, there were significant deficits in activities and contacts, especially with respect to those features which directly depend on the patients' level of activity (e. g. frequency of activities outside the household). Social infrastructure (e. g. frequency of attendance) and living conditions were positively correlated with life satisfaction, but were not significantly impaired in the depressed patients, neither were there differences in the financial situation between patients and controls. Thus, the social situation of elderly depressed patients is mainly characterised by a decreased level of activities, to which special therapeutic attention should be given.","1728":"The German version of the Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) inventory developed by Taylor and Dear (1981) is presented.

The factor analysis with the 40 Likert-scaled items yielded 4 dimensions (exclusion, integration, benevolence, social control) which account for 46 % of the total variance. As in previous studies, age had a negative effect and the level of education a positive effect on public attitudes, while the gender of the respondents had only a small effect. Familiarity with mental illness did not have an effect as important as in previous studies. There is a close correspondence between the German version and the original version of the CAMI-inventory.

The satellite ward was rated significantly better than the specialized wards by both staff and patients (p &lt; 0.01).

Based on possible pathophysiological similarities, especially cocaine and nicotine dependence are of focused interest in adolescents and adults with ADHD. The presence of ADHD may influence adolescent and adult substance-use disorders in different ways: earlier age of onset, higher frequency, longer duration of substance abuse and transition from alcohol-abuse to other substance-use disorders.

In a psychiatric context stalking describes a syndrome of pathological behavior, which is characterized by notorious following menacing, harassing and contacting a victim against its declared will. The patterns of behavior summarized as \"stalking\" have been the matter of interest for psychiatric research for a long time, e. g. as annoyance in the context of erotomania. This syndrome of stalking behavior can be associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders. The relevance of stalking as a syndromatic entity is illustrated by two cases of psychiatric inpatients who showed stalking behavior in their history. The first case describes a female patient following and harassing a man, who had turned down her attempts of starting a love affair. The second case describes a male patient, who had started to follow, harass and attack his partner after she had left him. These case reports are discussed in context with the literature existing on stalking behavior. A further objective of this paper is to discuss the new German harassment protection act in context with its implications on stalking behavior and the meaning of such behavior for psychiatric and forensic practice.","1740":"Psychotherapy of sex offenders is effective and reduces relapse rates when compared with untreated controls.

The patients with organic mental disorders are older and we exclude them for further examination because of the completely different psychosocial background. In the remaining 107 cases the schizophrenic disorders are clearly over-represented (75 % vs. 27 % of all admissions). Women are approx. 9 years older, are discharged three times more frequently at the negotiation and retained against their will for a shorter time than men. Men are more frequently isolated and compulsorily treated.

For this examination the SKID-II for personality disorders and the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) were used. 72 % of the sex offenders showed at least one personality disorder. The highest prevalence was found for cluster-B disorders, first of all the antisocial personality disorder. Using a PCL-R cut off score of 25 (for Europe) 10 of the 47 subjects (21 %) were diagnosed as \"psychopaths\", whereas being a \"psychopath\" is associated with a number of different personality disorders. The importance of structured diagnostic with regard to comorbidity of personality disorders in sex offenders imprisoned in maximum security psychiatric hospitals is stressed, and furthermore there is evidence that the PCL-R is a valid instrument for prognosis, but not a psychological-psychiatric instrument for the assessment of personality disorders.","1743":null,"1744":"Due to the passing of new laws and pressure caused by rising costs in public financing, forensic psychiatry and prisons must develop alternatives to conventional treatment in a closed setting.

Survey of the relevant literature. Following a time of therapeutic pessimism, the last decades have demonstrated the general effectiveness of treating offenders and lawbreakers. Adequate therapy has resulted in an up to 30% reduction of relevant re-offences. The positive effect in treating offenders was confirmed especially for community-related approaches. Additional research is necessary to further improve effectiveness. The requirements for a successful community-based therapy for offenders derived from the literature are summarised. There is still limited information on the differential effects of successful ambulant measures after serving one's sentence in a prison or forensic psychiatric security facility.

In the case regarding a risk to others there was widespread approval of sectioning and treatment (Germany 85 %, England 93 %) against the patient's will. Significant differences were seen in the cases of risk to the patients themselves with regards to treatment against the patient's will.

After developing a structured questionnaire integrating differences in European mental health care systems, a German national survey of current structural and procedural quality markers of psychiatric day hospitals was carried out in 2001. 51.4 % of the addressed psychiatric hospitals (N = 191) returned the questionnaire. Analysis is based on descriptive and correlational methods, compares the situation in the Eastern and Western German Federal States, and uses cluster analysis to differentiate the day hospitals according to their main program function. In general, establishment of day hospitals in Germany has not yet reached the evidence-based capacity level. This statement especially applies to the situation in rural areas. 56 % of the day hospitals currently assess themselves as an alternative to inpatient treatment simultaneously providing differentiated psychotherapeutic treatment. Comparing clinical institutions in the Eastern and Western parts of Germany demonstrates the clearer orientation towards acute psychiatric treatment in the recently (mostly after 1995) established East-German hospitals. This is reflected in the spectrum of main clinical diagnoses, in the average length of treatment episodes, in the definitions of contraindications, and in the provided diagnostic measures. While administrative circumstances are homogeneous for day hospitals, there is a considerable variation in staff numbers related to the core professions. Guidelines for professional training and continuous qualification as well as staffing have to be modified according to requirements resulting from the change of clinical functions. Each day hospital has to clarify and define its main program function(s), and has to better communicate the consequences for the regional mental health service system. ","1753":"The results of an inquiry about the difficulties of companionship between smokers and non-smokers in psychiatric wards are presented. Patients stated at the end of their treatment in a routine inquiry, by now focused on the issue of smoking, how they felt about the organization of their living together within the wards. Smokers have been additionally asked whether they would have preferred to be abstinent of tobacco and whether they missed supplementary therapy offers. About 70 per cent of the patients were smokers. The arrangement, giving permission to smoking in just one room of the ward, was agreed more or less by smokers and non-smokers. 30 per cent of the non-smokers would apply for a non-smoking ward. About 40 per cent of the smokers would prefer to stop smoking and missed suitable therapeutical offers. Restriction to just one room for smokers in each ward is accepted by smokers and non-smokers. A therapeutical offer to withdrawing from tobacco should figure among the routine offers of each hospital. ","1754":"There are numerous studies on the stigma of mental illness. However, the subjective stigma experiences of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and their relatives have, so far not been investigated. Narrative interviews with 22 family members of patients with OCD were carried out as part of a study on the burden of mental illness on the family. Experience of stigma was analysed as an aspect of subjective burden using a grounded theory approach. Different areas of life could be described, in which stigmatization is anticipated or experienced by family members of patients with OCD. Concealing is a relevant strategy for the members in dealing with the illness. Stigmatization can be minimized by impartially handling the illness and cooperation of patients, their relevant others and professionals. ","1755":"We present the concept of an extended documentation of psychiatric-psychotherapeutic treatment with the patients being in the center of information. Apart from a short treatment report for the outpatient therapist, we write a detailed letter to the patients themselves including informations and backgrounds of their psychiatric and medical history, psychopathological findings, diagnose(s), course of the current treatment and recommendations for the future. This procedure is in agreement with the tradition of psycho-educative approaches and self-management concepts. It intends to support patients to be self-conscious and responsible partners during and after the treatment process. We performed a pilot study for a predominantly descriptive evaluation of the concept in the day clinic setting. A standardized questionnaire in 30 previously treated patients and three case studies yielded a high acceptance and positive appraisal of the received letters with a substantial subjective impact for coping with the disorder and a positive option for dealing with family members and friends.","1756":"Caregivers' expectations regarding optimal psychiatric inpatient care should be evaluated using qualitative methodology. A content analysis of interviews with 32 caregivers was carried out. The statements and categories were quantitatively analysed to assess its relative importance. \"Much time of doctors and psychologists for discussion with the caregivers\" was expected most frequently. In addition, caregivers assigned high importance to successful treatment of patient by competent physicians and psychologists and to information provided to caregivers about therapies, medication, side-effects and treatment progress. 53 % of all statements were related to the category \"treatment and contact\", 20 % to \"information and education\", 15 % to \"clinical organisation and equipment\", and 13 % to \"admission and discharge\". Taking into account these findings, more attention should be paid to caregivers' expectations to reduce problems of interaction between clinicians and caregivers. This might be helpful to improve the cooperation between caregivers and psychiatric hospitals resulting in a higher consumer satisfaction. ","1757":"","1758":"","1759":"An 18-year-old man suffered a severe head trauma from a car accident. Eight months later the patient had a good general state of health. But at this time he was referred to our psychiatric hospital and he reported increased checking compulsions and aggressive obsessions. In addition there was increased impulsivity. The patient was treated with an selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor (SSRI) and showed a clinical response. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has rarely been described after traumatic brain injury. Clinical symptoms, neuropsychological dysfunctions, brain imaging and therapy are illustrated. The represented connections of the frontal brain lesions and OCD-symptoms with interventions in the serotonin system support the neurobiological hypotheses of the obsessive-compulsive disorder.","1760":"Huntington's disease is a hereditary and progressive disease of the central nervous system. Sudden and irregular hyperkinesias are prominent. Psychopathological findings are very frequent and often proceed the decline of motor functions for years. Almost all the patients develop a dementia in later stages of the illness. This case study shows the treatment of a patient with Huntington's disease, verified by genetic analysis, with the atypical antipsychotic drug amisulpride. In this case the psychiatric disturbances and cognitive impairments were the only signs of the disease. The treatment showed an impressive improvement. Neuropsychological aspects of the disease are discussed.","1761":"The self-concept and the partner relationships of patients with bipolar affective disorder in remission were investigated with the Giessen-Test (GT, Beckmann et al. ) comparing the bipolar patients with unipolar depressive patients, a control group of orthopedic patients and the standard sample of the Giessen-Test. The new dimensions \"self-esteem\" and \"near-to-object\" were developed by means of the Giessen-Test items. Self-esteem was significantly lower in bipolar patients in remission than in the controls. The bipolar patients also described themselves as \"more distant to others\" than the controls. Bipolar and unipolar-depressive patients had a similar self-concept and view of their partner relationships. The results underline the importance of the regulation of self-esteem and the interpersonal dimension in the long-term course of bipolar affective disorder. Therapeutic implications are discussed.","1762":"In our study we compare n = 64 in-patient suicides with a group of non-suicide in-patients which received psychiatric treatment during the same period. The matched patient was the next admitted patient. We found a significantly higher portion of schizophrenic and depressed patients in the suicide group, whereas suicides showed more depressive symptoms, more suicidal ideations before the suicide and more subjective suffering. Suicides received more psychopharmaca.","1763":"The aim of this study was to investigate the coping strategies of relatives of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. 22 narrative interviews were analysed by a Grounded Theory approach. While parents in our investigation often try to educate their ill children, spouses focus on resources of the patient. Children seem to take a parent-role in interaction with the ill father or mother. Family members try to support patients in dealing with the illness. Therefore, different strategies to cope with OCD are developed, ranging between assisting in rituals and opposition to the symptoms. ","1764":"The Basel Project on Psychiatry and the Printed Media has focussed on the role of the media in the development and enhancement of prejudice and stigma against the mentally ill. Analyzing the reporting of the German national paper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on schizophrenia we show a gap between the competent reporting on the illness schizophrenia and a devaluating use of schizophrenia as a metaphor. This is of special importance since almost three fifth of the identified articles (48 of 83) use schizophrenia as a metaphor.","1765":"","1766":"Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly used for the treatment of elderly patients. However, there are only few studies on their efficacy and side effects in this patient group. The case of a 67-year old patient is presented, in whom under treatment with olanzapine in usual dosage, serum level increased into the toxic range. This olanzapine overdosage was accompanied by severe impairments in visual and verbal memory and by an increase of slow-frequency activity in the EEG. Both alterations may be attributed to the anticholinergic effects of olanzapine and reversed rapidly after dose reduction and normalization of the olanzapine serum level.","1767":"In the last few years some studies and case reports has been published that suggest a frequent occurrence of metabolic disorders like hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia during the treatment with atypical antipsychotics. However, regarding the high prevalence rates of these disorders in the general population, a possible causative relationship should be substantiated, i.e. occurrence of elevated blood levels within a short time interval after the starting of the medication. In the presented case a hyperlipidemia (triglycerides up to 1247 mg\/dl) was observed soon after the beginning of zotepine medication. After the reduction of zotepine lipid levels in serum decreased and normalised after switching to classical antipsychotics. Therefore a causative relationship between the occurrence of the hyperlipidemia and the zotepine medication is very likely.","1768":"Tolerance of ambiguity means the ability to tolerate contradictory and incalculable informations. There is the hypothesis that a high degree of tolerance of ambiguity correlates with creativity. It is unclear how various psychiatric illnesses and psychopathological conditions affect tolerance of ambiguity. Therefore we carried out a study concerning the tolerance of ambiguity: 154 persons were systematically investigated with a standardized questionnaire (31 schizophrenic in-patients, 41 neurotic in-patients, 49 members of the staff as control group, 33 artists as control group). In addition we examined the degree of depression in the neurotic group, the anancasm score and the well-being in general. In the schizophrenic group we assessed psychotic symptoms, the positive and negative symptoms, medication, anancasm and depression. Tolerance of ambiguity decreased in the following sequence: artists - members of the staff - neurotic in-patients - schizophrenic in-patients. It became evident that in the schizophrenic group negative symptoms negatively correlates with tolerance of ambiguity. The results seem to confirm the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between tolerance of ambiguity and creativity. In addition, the higher degree of intolerance of ambiguity in schizophrenic patients may represent a protective mechanism. Intolerance of ambiguity possibly protects from too many contradictory informations. Furthermore the necessity is confirmed that creative therapy methods should be carefully chosen to avoid irritation on the one hand and not to neglect the required training of creative basic functions on the other hand. Although our results weaken the thesis that psychiatric illness is generally associated with an increase of creativity they don't exclude that highly creative performances in some individuals are possible who are especially talented in spite of or even because of their emotional suffering.","1769":"To describe the changes of utilization of a psychiatric department following its decentralization into an Upper Austrian region, the Salzkammergut. 9 months before and after decentralization all kinds of contacts to psychiatric patients (inpatients, outpatients, day clinic patients, patients of consulting psychiatric service) regarding frequency of contacts, case numbers and diagnosis have been evaluated. For the inpatients their legal status was recorded. Since the establishment of the decentralized psychiatric department an increase in the frequency of admissions of inpatients up to 157 % could be revealed. Depressive disorders showed the largest increase of admissions (204 %), remarkable increase was also seen in substance use disorders, neurotic and organic disorders (between 171 % and 183 %). Changes also emerged concerning the legal status of the patients with a decrease of the percentage of involuntary admissions from 26.5 % prior to decentralization to 20.7 % thereafter. Among the patients seen by the consulting service length of stay was higher than usually seen on somatic wards as there was a very high proportion of patients with depressive syndromes. Within the context of decentralization provision of psychiatric care seems to be improved. Treating more patients with depressive and neurotic disorders the staff of the psychiatric ward was confronted to apply more psychotherapeutic interventions to meet the patient's neurotic and suicidal behaviour. ","1770":"Investigations of treatment costs are of increasing importance in community mental health care. Yet, they are often difficult and expensive to conduct. This study explores whether and, if so, to what extent direct treatment costs as paid by insurance companies and social welfare in the German health care system can be estimated through a simple Institutionalisation-Index. Based on the literature and clinical judgment, a simple Institutionalisation-Index was formed reflecting the degree of institutional protection in supported housing, long-term day care, partial hospitalisation and full hospitalisation programmes. As part of a comprehensive evaluation of a model institution for community mental health care in Berlin, actually paid treatment costs and Institutionalisation-Index (II) were identified for 1194 patients over a total period of 23 years and compared with each other. The Pearson correlation coefficient between II and paid costs was 0.97 (p &lt; 0,001). In calculations for subgroups and different periods of time, II and costs were almost identical, too. The Institutionalisation-Index provides a sufficiently precise estimate of direct costs as paid by insurance companies and social welfare for different forms of care in community based institutions and hospitals. The II can be adjusted to incorporate further forms of community based care. In systems with similar funding arrangements, the simple method to establish a Institutionalisation-Index should facilitate cost analyses in community mental health care. ","1771":"The study aimed to investigate the expectations of patients of a psychiatric department at a general hospital regarding their inpatient care. At a key day 131 patients were surveyed by a questionnaire comprising 39 items. The response rate was 70 % (n = 91). The patients assign most importance to successful treatment, empathic doctors, preservation of human rights, competent doctors, and friendly staff. The expectations of patients of a psychiatric department are similar to those of patients of a psychiatric state hospital. Patients' expectations are not confounded with the psychiatric disorder, psychopathology, subjective feeling, heaviness of illness, or psychosocial functioning. The internal consistency is alpha = 0.93. The questionnaire is suitable for valid and reliable measuring the expectations of both patients of a psychiatric department and patients of a psychiatric state hospital when evaluating patient's satisfaction. ","1772":"The presented document discusses the problems of psychological\/psychiatric and emergency long term users. The author, director of the East Berlin Crisis Centre, describes the long-term patient phenomenon from different perspectives. He develops ideas to change the concept of acute intervention. The crisis intervention is established in the context of the Empowerment Theory. The developed structural basis will be discussed accompanied by practical examples.","1773":"This study aims at outlining the development of social-psychiatric research in German-speaking countries between 1975 and 2001. All original articles dealing with social-psychiatric issues, with appeared in Psychiatrische Praxis in the years 1975 - 1977, 1981 - 1983, 1987 - 1989, 1993 - 1995 and 1999 - 2001 were analysed. Mental health care research clearly dominated social-psychiatric research in the period investigated. While in the beginning, most papers were devoted to the conceptualisation and description of psychiatric services, in recent years more studies on outcome evaluation and quality assurance were published. The number of articles on the subjective perspective of patients and relatives has increased constantly. Topics such as treatment satisfaction, subjective illness theory, and subjective quality of life enjoy growing interest. The same holds for stigmatisation of mentally ill people. By contrast, studies investigating psycho-social influences on the development and the course of mental disorders are still very rare. The results are discussed against the backdrop of the development of psychiatry in the period investigated. ","1774":"","1775":"","1776":"Atypical neuroleptics have a lot of advantages compared with conventional substances. It is still disadvantageous that a depot-medication is missing. The role of the form of application has been studied in a schizophrenia-out-patient department. In 25 out-patients under therapy with atypical neuroleptics the time of rehospitalisation per year was retrospectively determined and compared with that of 25 out-patients receiving depot-medication. Both groups were comparable with regard to some patient-characteristics and predictors of the course of the disease. It turned out that for patients with depot-neuroleptics the time spent in hospital per year was half of that for patients under atypical drugs. It had been in the same range in both groups 4 to 6 years ago and had decreased until the last year of the catamnesis in patients with depot-medication, but not in those with atypics. Typical neuroleptics as oral medication are disadvantageous in this respect. Despite efforts to reach a good compliance in all patients, preferable effects of atypical drugs with regard to negative symptoms are opposed by less favourable rehospitalisation times. This has to be taken into consideration in differential indication.","1777":"Factitious disorders have been reported in 0.5 - 1 % of general hospital patients. It often takes several years until the disorder is detected. During this period, enormous health care cost can arise not least out of iatrogenic self-induced mutilations and related secondary somatic complications. Apart from surgeons and physicians, consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrists are particularly called on to diagnose factitious disorders at an early stage in order to avoid unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, treatment dropout and doctor shopping. This article gives an overview of clinical features and treatment approaches in C-L psychiatry settings.","1778":"Differences in the intensity of social psychiatric care for mentally ill people are examined in two communal socio-psychiatric services in Saxony. Service users are subdivided into three groups according to intensity of service use (low utilization, average utilization and high utilization). The analyses are based on data from a standardized documentation system in a rural and urban catchment area. Intensity of care varies with structural parameters (geographical distance between patient home and service, staff resources). A small group (about 20 % of all clients) with a high frequency of contacts with service staff (high users) receive more than 50 % of all care contacts. Standardized documentation is a good basis for the description of different patterns of service utilization, but more information is needed about service users, e.g. data on their health care needs. ","1779":"The following report describes Mr. Z., who was a former long-term hospitalized psychiatric patient and who turned from a permanent inpatient into a high utilizer of a hospital in a process of several years. In addition the report describes the commitment and often unconventional ways of cooperation by different staff and institutions, that made it possible for Mr. Z. to look forward to a future outside the hospital.","1780":"In alcohol addiction inpatient treatment an increase of readmissions is noted since years. Because little is known about the psychosocial and psychiatric background of addictive patients with many readmissions, this study aimed at a comprehensive psychiatric and psychological description of those patients. Consecutively admitted alcohol addicted patients to the department of addictions of a German psychiatric hospital were allocated to a group with more than three previous treatments in 12 months before index admission (heavy user; n = 37) and a control group of patients with not more than one previous admission in the last year (n = 42). Patients were comprehensively interviewed with standardised psychiatric and neuropsychological instruments (ASI, cognitive skills) as well as with questionnaires for assessment of subjective psychopathology, quality of life and confidence of abstinence. Patients with many readmissions were chronically ill addictives with severe social, physical and mental disabilities as consequences of alcohol consumption. In subjective experience of quality of life, psychopathology and confidence of abstinence heavy users did not differ from the control group. Heavy users showed significantly less cognitive skills. For chronically ill alcohol addicted patients alternatives to the repeatedly used standard acute treatment must be developed. ","1781":"To find out whether the use of hospital days in all psychiatric inpatient services in the province of Lower Austria is equally distributed among patients or whether subgroups with different intensity of hospital day use can be identified, and if so, how these subgroups can be characterized. Data collected for administrative purposes for all three inpatient services of Lower Austria were analyzed for the years 1996 to 2000. Record Linkage allowed to identify patients who had used several of these hospitals within the respective study periods. Cumulative hospital days per patient were calculated for each of the years studied and the distribution of these cumulative hospital days was analyzed. Of the 202 996 hospital days accrued in the year 1996, 44.5 % were consumed by patients who continuously stayed in hospital during the whole year (\"static\" population). In 2000 this percentage had dropped to 16.3 %; also the total number of hospital days had decreased by one third to 141 738. Of those patients, who had at least once been admitted and\/or discharged during a specific year (\"dynamic population\"), a stable proportion of around 17.0 % were responsible for 50.0 % of all hospital days. These patients were more frequently of female sex, significantly younger, had more often repeated admissions and suffered more frequently from schizophrenia than the rest of the group. The astonishing finding that, despite substantial change in the system of psychiatric care over five years, the percentage of patients with high values for cumulative hospital days remains constant, warrants further analyses. In such analyses not only patient and illness characteristics should be studied (which is suggested by the terms \"heavy users\" and \"high utilizers\"), but also factors such as the social context of the patient, the existence or non-existence of community psychiatric services and their functioning, as well as existing or non-existing financial incentives for single services. ","1782":"The aim of the study was to examine the extent of use of acute psychiatric inpatient care, and to determine sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics of so called \"heavy users\". A cohort of 1811 patients with first hospitalisation in 1995 was followed by means of the German psychiatric basic documentation (DGPPN-BADO) over a five-year period from 1995 to 1999. The average cumulative length of stay was 63.2 days (SD 98.4), the median 32 days. 5 % of patients stayed in hospital more than 238 days and 1 % even more than 538.1 days within five years. 50 % of patients \"consumed\" only 10 % of inpatient days, whereas other 10 % of patients accounted for nearly 50 % of the resources. By means of a regression analysis ten significant predictors for a long cumulative hospital stay could be found, e. g. schizophrenia, personality disorder, socio-therapeutic modalities, sheltered living, and low psychosocial capability (GAF) at discharge. Within five years an average number of hospital stays of 1.8 (SD 2.1) was found. 5 % of patients had more than four inpatient stays, 1 % even more than ten. Regressions analysis revealed seven significant predictors for a high number of hospital stays, e. g. alcohol dependence, comorbid alcohol abuse, and a short interval between first and second admission. As no distinct group of \"heavy user\" could be identified, individual treatment strategies should be addressed, and qualitative studies and in-depth statistic analyses must be performed. ","1783":"This paper describes the extent of heavy use of inpatient psychiatric services. It reveals predictors of heavy use. 969 users of inpatient psychiatric services in the city of Leipzig were identified based on health insurance data. 16,7 % of the patients had at least 3 admissions and were classified as heavy users. They accounted for 36,4 % of the total inpatient cost. Patients suffering from schizophrenia or a comorbidity with personality disorders had a higher risk to be a heavy user. The kind of facility and the way of discharge were also predictors for heavy use. Further qualitative analyses should identify reasons for heavy users to utilize inpatient services and find out other opportunities of care for these patients. ","1784":"This paper reviews findings and problems of heavy users research. The German- and English language literature about \"heavy users\" and relevant border areas was analyzed. Heavy users are patients who consume a disproportionate share of medical services. The characteristics of heavy users are inhomogeneous. Social problems, denial of illness, non-compliance, comorbid personality disorders and substance misuse contribute significantly to heavy use. Future studies should define heavy use illness-related. More research is needed to clarify whether heavy use of special services is adequate to the patients situation. Heavy users should be identified early, in order to offer them alternative services, which better fulfil the patients specific conditions and prevent an inadequate heavy use of expensive services.

There are possible mechanisms by which olanzapine could interfere with glucose metabolism but decreased insulin sensitivity due to weight gain is of most relevance.","1787":"Tardive dyskinesia is a severe complication of neuroleptic treatment. It may develop weeks, even years after starting a neuroleptic treatment and the symptoms may be irreversible. Neuroleptic compounds are not only used in cases of schizophrenia, but also in cases of severe depression with delusional symptoms. We want to present the case of a 67 year old female patient who developed haloperidol induced dyskinesea and stress unto the successful treatment of this complication with olanzapine in combination with paroxetine. Under this regime not only the improvement of the depression, but also of the tardive dyskinesea was impressive.","1788":"In the discussion of the increasing costs of health care in Germany the frequent and often times long inpatient treatments of elderly patients are pointed out. Since these patients also suffer from psychiatric disorders very frequently, a psychiatric consultation is required rather often. This study was aimed to evaluate the requirements of a consultation service for elder inpatients. For this purpose all 9363 consultation reports from 1994 to 1998 were evaluated retrospectively. 2152 (31.4 %) of the patients visited by the psychiatric consultation service were over 64 years old. The most frequent diagnoses were organic brain syndrome (ICD-10: F0), particularly senile dementia (ICD-10: F00 - 03), adjustment disorder (ICD-10: F43) and affective disorders, particularly depressive disorders (ICD-10: F3). In 139 patients (6,5 %) a consultation was requested because of a suicidal attempt prior to admission. Our results suggest that in a gerontopsychiatric consultation service predominantly old patients with internal diseases and with the need of psychosocial help are visited and that the specific knowledge of psychopharmacological treatment in multimorbid patients as well as the psychosocial help and legal advice is requested. These aspects should therefore be a special focus in educational programs for a gerontopsychiatric consultation service.","1789":"In the controversy about severely chronic mental patients, who still reside in the psychiatric hospital after decades of deinstitutionalization, their quality of life (QoL) has become a main topic. On the basis of a critique of the dominant, mere standardized approach to QoL this method is compared with a qualitative approach in such a schizophrenic \"residual\" patient group (n = 144). While in the standardized approach a high level of subjective QoL could be found that correlated positively with the duration of hospitalisation, the open interviews yielded specific experiences of deficiencies. The appraisal of the quality of life especially of chronic or hospitalized patients is reconsidered.","1790":"Long-standing processes of deinstitutionalization often display processes of selection that result in groups of patients with marked disability profiles left in hospital. According to the literature socially deviant and unacceptable behaviour are a main obstacle to living in the community. Therefore, a group of \"remnant\" chronic schizophrenic patients was analysed by means of a latent class analysis with indicators of social behaviour and compliance. Three different subgroups were found, one of which had an extremely poor level of adaptation. However, prognosis of staff with regard to patients' ability to live outside the psychiatric hospital, and the rates of patients being moved into the community in the course of subsequent deinstitutionalization were not different among the three groups. Characteristics of \"most-difficult-to-place patients' \" as discussed in the literature are called into question on the basis of the results of this study.","1791":"People with psychiatric diseases are often afflicted by processes of social disintegration and social problems are of great importance for the treatment of the mentally ill. Two departments of psychiatry and psychotherapy with obligatory service for their area - one in an inner city area of a large town with disadvantageous social structure, one in a small town with more favourable economic data - collected data during a two-months-period in 1998 according to the social situation of their patients. 38,0 % resp. 31,9 % of the patients were living under conditions of poverty; 12,2 % resp. 11,5 % had acute housing problems, only 17,3 % resp. 31,7 % had some kind of payed occupation. Poverty was defined either as being dependent on public assistance or having an income below 50 % of the average. Patients with schizophrenic psychosis and patients with substance abuse related disorders formed in both departments the main groups and were at the same time those with the lowest income. Patients with substance abuse, mainly alcoholics, were more afflicted by social disintegration in the inner city area than in the small town sample. Concerning schizophrenic disorders, regional differences were not as prominent. The high risk of poverty among the mentally ill has to be taken in account in the development of community services, hospital staff and social legislation. ","1792":"This paper analyses, in what way psychiatrists considered housing and work as criteria of social integration of mentally ill people and what models of care were suggested in Germany throughout the 20th century. Publications in 29 German professional and scientific psychiatric journals through the complete period from 1900 to 2000 and monographs were searched for papers on the above issues. Until the second half of the century, integrative initiatives related to housing and work generated in asylums without the aim of a full social integration of the patients. In the activistic concept of NS-psychiatry, work became an obligation for patients and a criterion for selection that decided on life and death. Not until the late 1950s, there again was an orientation towards integration in psychiatric care in both German states. Whilst already in 1963 the \"Rodewisch Theses\" outlined recommendations for the rehabilitation of the mentally ill already in the GDR (East Germany), a similar mark of reform ideas was published in the \"enquete\" in the FRG (West Germany) in 1975. In the GDR initiatives were limited to a small number of locations. In the FRG and the re-unified Germany various forms of sheltered housing and work were established - also with significant regional variation. However, a clear discussion of underlying aims and implications for the structure of mental health care was not found in the psychiatric literature. In the 20th century a tradition of psychiatric ideas related to housing and work did not develop in Germany. Particularly, there were only sporadic contributions from university psychiatry. Work was more frequently explicit subject of discussions than housing. Both areas were - slowly and in discontinuity - established as criteria of integration of people with mental illnesses, which was increasingly accepted as an aim of mental health care. ","1793":"This study aimed at investigating how caregivers of schizophrenic patients perceive the contact with mental health professionals and which are the key factors for their satisfaction or dissatisfaction. 42 in-depth interviews were analysed with a view to discover the caregivers' experiences with psychiatric treatment. The analysis of the interview data showed three fundamental areas in which caregivers perceive the contact with psychiatrists as supportive or troublesome: 1. the information about the disease and the treatment, 2. the long-term cooperation with the caregivers, and 3. the general way of behaving towards the caregivers and the patients. Caregivers' attitudes towards psychiatry are strongly influenced by positive and negative experiences they have had in these three fields. The widespread criticism of caregivers is caused by dissatisfaction with central areas of psychiatric practice. Optimal treatment and consulting conditions, from the caregivers' perspective, can only be approximately achieved. However, psychiatrists, patients, and caregivers should stay in close contact in order to meet the needs of the caregivers, such as being informed, being taken seriously and being involved in the treatment.

It is compared to Kaspar Hauser, similarities and differences are highlighted. The \"Kaspar Hauser of Stuttgart\" is retrospectively revealed as a young man with experiences of severe deprivation. The missing case history and independent history were an obstacle in the treatment, albeit not fundamental, advantages being reached with a relation-oriented approach. Informations obtained after clarification of the identity of the young man suggest a multiplication of unfavourable circumstances, leading to sub-optimal treatment and finally the \"Kaspar-Hauser-Situation\". Contributing were his belonging to the less integrated group of migrants in Germany, as well as severe deprivation in the family and a generally sub-optimal treatment of mentally disturbed young patients.

Meta-analysis was conducted using precision weighted algorithms. 78 % of the opiate addicts had at least one co-morbid psychiatric disorder at least once in their lifetime. Especially personality disorders had a high prevalence (42 %). The second highest prevalence was found with mood disorders (31 %), the third highest prevalence was anxiety disorders with 8 %. The high prevalence of psychiatric disorders among opioid addicts signaled the need to improve and develop better treatment programs.

In 17 Swiss centres for heroin-assisted treatment 85 opiate addicts were assessed at entry using the SKID interview. Lifetime prevalence of co-morbid Axis I or Axis II disorders was 86 %. Most frequently patients were diagnosed with a personality disorder (58 %). Second frequently were mood disorders with a prevalence of 55 %, followed by anxiety disorders with a prevalence of 26 %. The high prevalence of co-morbid psychiatric disorders indicate the urgent necessity to further develop and adapt health services for opioid addicts. ","1798":"Deinstitutionalization (DI) of most of the chronic long-stay patients has taken place in the last decades in Germany. However, a \"residual\" group of patients often remains in psychiatric hospitals, with an ongoing controversy on an appropriate type of their care (community based vs. hospital). Clinical, functional and social characteristics of such schizophrenic patients still residing in the long-stay wards in the German state of Hesse after decades of DI are presented. The n = 266 patients investigated displayed a marked degree of negative symptoms and moderate positive symptoms but, however, severe social disabilities. In addition, the patients were very dependent in daily living, had an extremely impoverished social network and leisure activities. The findings contribute to the research on \"difficult-to-place\" patients described in the literature.","1799":"Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) as a basis for funding will be introduced in Germany in 2003 with exemption for Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine. Overall, DRGs have proven to be poor predictors of resource consumption and therefore could lead to financial harms for psychiatric or psychotherapeutic facilities. Beneath these risks, a DRG-System could be a strong incentive for further development and implementation of treatment standards. Furthermore an exemption of a DRG-System could trigger the isolation of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine in the medical field of acute care. Therefore DRGs should be regarded as a major challenge to strengthen the importance of the treatment of psychic disorders.","1800":"Physicians are obliged to inform all patients about the purpose and risks of therapeutic procedures, also drug treatment. However, although there may be some severe difficulties in informing psychiatric patients only very few data concerning this topic are available as yet. Thus, the aim of this query was to evaluate the patients' opinion of the information about medication. In this investigation 255 psychiatric inpatients were asked to complete a questionnaire. 42 % of the patients complained about no or insufficient information of the expected effects of the prescribed medication and 62 % about no or insufficient information of side-effects. An association was found between the willingness to take the medication for a long time and insight in their psychic condition, but not with satisfying informing. This query showed the need of a more precise and satisfying information on medication and the need to develop strategies for a better information about side-effects. ","1801":"Client- or Patient-Orientation is seen as an indicator for quality of psychiatric work. How to observe and record this orientation? Three different concepts are presented: the German A11, a staff- and client-oriented documentation, Soteria Bern, and Shepherd's 25 homes-investigation around London. Four areas of typical conflicts of interest between client- and institutional orientation are presented with examples: duty times, strategies to fill up beds, \"creaming off\", and application-talks for clients to enter a residential setting. On the basis of the quality of Life and Care research and the 3 concepts above questions for visiting and evaluating homes and living groups and for personal check-ups are presented.","1802":"","1803":"","1804":"Self-mutilation of the genitals in man is a rare phenomenon mainly occurring in young males. The importance of conflicts about the male role, difficulties with the male identification in childhood and feeling of guilt for sexual offences are discussed in the literature. The influence of developmental crisis on this symbolic form of automutilation will be discussed in our case report. We present a case of a young schizophrenic man whose illness started in adolescence. He committed genital automutilation already in early adolescence, as a young male he autocastrated himself. We demonstrate the connection of specific problems of development in adolescence and psychopathology. Autocastration will be discussed as a \"psychotic\" solution of the adolescent conflict of dependence. Developmental conflicts may be important pathoplastic factors who may lead to severe psychopathology and misbehavior. Additionally to a psychopharmacological treatment a specific adolescent- and conflictoriented psychotherapy for solving the developmental conflicts in young schizophrenic patients should be established.

This case report is about a 52 year old male suffering of alcoholism in addition. Aspects of this special comorbidity are discussed. Neuroleptic treatment with Risperidone led to a partial remission of the delusional syndrome.","1806":"The diagnosis of \"masked depression\" was very common in the 70'es and 80'es for patients with somatic complaints without an organic counterpart, when a psychic illness was assumed. Today this diagnosis does not play an important role any more - neither clinically nor scientifically. This article examines the background of the enormous initial importance of this diagnostic concept and of its final abandonment. Critical reflection of the literature. The main reason for the immense success of that diagnosis was the tempting possibility of subsuming patients with a multitude of only unsatisfactorily explicable and treatable somatic symptoms under one single concept. In addition, this concept allowed to derive a uniform treatment, i.e. pharmacotherapy with antidepressants. Several problems inherent in the diagnosis of masked depression finally led to the dropping of that concept: the expansion of that diagnosis onto a vast number of disorders, the continuing lack of clarity of the concept (disorder of recognition vs. disorder of communication; the positive proof of psychic symptoms as a prerequisite vs. the positive proof of psychic symptoms as an exclusion criterion for that diagnosis). Last but not least, the introduction of DSM-III and ICD-10 as operationalized, purely descriptive and rather theory-free systems of diagnostic classification supported that development. The present diagnoses for those patients re-emphasize the somatic symptomatology. Formerly \"masked depressed\" patients are now diagnosed as suffering from somatization disorder, somatoform disorder, psychosomatic disorder, conversion disorder, neurasthenia or hypochondriasis. ","1807":"Our study explores possibilities to do quality management by routinely assessing patient satisfaction in hospital. Which aspects of treatment and setting are vital for patients and how do they evaluate them? Do hospital departments differ concerning profiles of patient satisfaction? Does the analysis over time reveal relevant differences in quality? Which use can be made of the results in terms of quality management? We report results of routine assessment of patient satisfaction by means of a questionnaire with adequate teststatistical properties. 2858 patients could be included. Interpersonal aspects of treatment are vital for patients. We find differences between departments and over time. Feedback to the therapeutic teams have a practical impact. It is possible to integrate routine assessment of patient satisfaction into quality management. ","1808":"41 mentally ill patients with sexual dysfunctions were examined by means of a semistructured interview. In this interview we tried to assess quality, intensity and duration of the sexual dysfunctions. In addition to this we developed a self-rating-scale in order to assess the patients' possibilities to talk about their sexual problems with a therapist. These attitudes were related to the attitudes of the staff towards the same issue. We found out that the dysfunctions had lasted for 11.0 years on average and that 58.8 % of the patients hadn't made any attempts for specific therapeutic steps so far. Patients with sexual dysfunctions such as erectile impotence were more interested in having additional talks about their sexual problems than patients with sexual disturbances such as libido loss. They were also more inclined to see psychiatric medication as a cause for their sexual problems. In addition to this, the complete group of the examined patients considered as to be less important that the therapist was of the same sex than the staff, particularly if the interviewer was not of the same sex. Our results confirm the thesis, that it is worth paying more attention to sexual dysfunctions of mentally ill patients, necessary therapeutic steps should be taken if possible. A positive effect of this probably seems to be a better compliance.","1809":"Since the 1970s, a model institution for community mental health care with three partial hospitalisation programmes and various out-patient services was run in the Berlin district Charlottenburg. The study evaluates, to what extent the institution fulfilled its aim to provide long-term care for severely and chronically ill patients at relatively low costs. It also identified predictors of outcome. Case register data of 1194 patients who were treated within a period of 23 years were analysed. Patient characteristics, length of care and treatment costs are presented. Costs were calculated on the basis of daily rates as paid to care providers in 1996. Regression analyses were computed for predicting length of care and costs after the first year. On average, length of care was 2.4 years and costs per year were 57 000,- German Marks ( 29 000,-). Patients with shorter and longer duration of care differed in only a few of the recorded sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Significant predictors for long-term costs were the legal status of being under a care order and costs in the first year. However, only 18 % of the variance of costs after the first year were explained. The findings suggest that a) community mental health care in the studied form may not reach all patients with severe mental illness, b) in most cases, the notion of a lifelong treatment in such care systems does not reflect reality, c) the paid costs are lower than for long-term in-patient care, but still rather high, and d) the usually recorded patient characteristics are of little value for predicting long-term outcome. ","1810":"Part II of this study will explore more accurately, how caregivers of schizophrenic patients perceive the financial burdens of the disease. 42 In-depth-interviews with parents and spouses of schizophrenic patients were analysed using a qualitative-interpretative technique. When talking about their living situation, caregivers tended to keep away from the topic of financial charges; often they played down objective financial disadvantages or didn't assess them as burdensome. Considerable financial burdens were reported by parents of young patients still living in the parents' household and by spouses in families with very low income. Financial burdens are usually superimposed by other problems of the caregivers, such as dealing with acute episodes and sorrow about the future. Thus, not only the material, but also the immaterial costs of caregivers should be taken into consideration when taking health policy decisions. ","1811":"The aim of this study was to compare financial burden of parents and spouses, whose relative is suffering from schizophrenia. The first article (part I) draws attention to quantitative analysis. 51 parents and 52 spouses filled in the questionnaire about illness related expenses and financial loss; additionally they were asked to estimate the experienced burden on a subjective dimension. Direct cash expenditures on behalf of the patients' illness were reported by 63 % spouses and 69 % parents. Above all, the patient's reduced ability to work was seen as main cause for long-term loss of family income. In general economic disadvantages were not considered as burdensome. Although most parents and spouses of schizophrenic patients experience illness related financial disadvantages, it seems that these costs were usually not defined as serious problem. For a better understanding of this finding further analysis of the subjective perspective on perceived financial burden is needed (see part II). ","1812":"","1813":"","1814":"Psychoeducation is an important part in the therapy of mental diseases. Until now there is little experience with patients and their family members attending the same psychoeducational group. We work with a psychoeducational group for depressed patients and their families. The aims are support and relief for the family, information about the affective disorder and acquisition of skills to improve the relationship between patients and family members. Every three months we start a new group with three sessions. At the first session we give information about symptoms, the disease and prognosis. At the second meeting we discuss the causes and how to deal with the disorder. The contents of the last session are the treatment and recidive prophylaxis. In the time from winter 1998 to spring 2000 six different groups have taken place with 101 patients and family members as participants. There was a high continuity of participation and a positive feed-back of the members. We can recommend this kind of psychoeducational group for other psychiatric hospitals. Patients and their family members can come to terms with this illness and become experts on depression.","1815":"This study is aimed at exploring what schizophrenic patients and their closest relatives expect the further course of the illness will be like and how it can be influenced. Problem-centered interviews were conducted with 31 schizophrenic patients and their closest relatives at discharge from hospital treatment. The verbatim transcripts of the interviews were analyzed by means of structuring qualitative content analysis. Most frequently, the respondents expected an improvement of the illness or they were unsure whether the actual recovery from psychosis will persist or whether a further relapse will occur. Less frequently, the respondents were sure that this will be the case or that the illness will take a chronic, eventually deteriorating course. The majority was convinced that the course of the illness can be influenced, by psychiatric treatment as well as by the patients themselves. As concerns the social situation in the near future, particularly changes of the occupational status were hoped for. The assessment of the prognosis of the schizophrenic illness by most patients and relatives appears quite realistic. Rather than considering themselves as helpless victims they see opportunities for influencing the further course of the illness. This should have a positive influence on the readiness to use mental health service and to comply with treatment recommendations. ","1816":"Members of HPE, an Austrian self-help organization for the relatives of mentally ill people, were questioned about their opinion with regard to the situation of families with a mentally ill member. A questionnaire was sent to the addresses of members of this self-help organisation. 182 respondents reported to care for 132 male and 50 female sufferers diagnosed as having a psychosis from the schizophrenic spectrum replied. Relatives, who care for male sufferers reported greater distress than those caring for females. Depression and exhaustion are reported significantly more frequently in caregivers of males. Other burdens, for example financial burdens, to assist the sufferer in the household, renunciation of holidays, and the problem of neglect also have a tendency to be more common among those caring for men. These gender differences cannot be accounted for by differences in the course of illness. Our study showed no evidence of gender differences in this regard. Contrary to our expectations women in our study are less compliant with medication and psychosocial treatment. Despite a better compliance with treatment strategies among men, relatives of males generally experience a greater burden. Our results indicate a greater need for the development of independence strategies for male sufferers and a requirement that professionals support sufferers and carers in this direction. ","1817":"The enclosed paper tries to encompass the relatives of patients of three different geriatric groups diagnosed. It tries to establish the difference in care and which special factor influences each group concerning the burden of care. Comparison of three groups: 1. Alzheimer-dementia, 2. vascular-dementia, 3. nondemented patients. It was found that it is mostly partners and children who are the carers in all three groups diagnosed. The social behaviour of the Alzheimer patient is the most stressful part of caring. The relatives of patients with vascular dementia are most stressed by disturbing behaviour and memory impairment and the relatives of the non dementia group by impaired mood and inadequate behaviour. The burden of care is the hardest for the relatives of the Alzheimer patients. For all three groups diagnosed the non cognitive symptoms are the main factor of the carers burden. ","1818":"Behavioral group therapy program is presented of patients with OCD and the involvement of their significant others. First experiences of evaluation are reported. 20 patients (10 women, 10 men) diagnosed with OCD were treated in a 16-session behavioral group therapy which included the involvement of 17 family members in selected sessions. The behavioral group therapy program involved cognitive restructuring, behavior exposure to anxiety-evoking stimuli and the discussion about the family system. Y-BOCS and a self-rating scale for the assessment of treatment benefit were used as outcome measures. In this study, Y-BOCS scores reduced from a mean of 24 before therapy to 19,8 after therapy. Patients and their significant others agreed on the general benefit from the group therapy and the level of understanding of individual problems. Family members in particular appreciated that they had learned more about coping strategies regarding OCD-symptoms.The majority of patients and their significant others would recommend behavioral group therapy to other affected people. Behavioral group therapy can be effective in reducing OCD-symptoms. Inclusion of family members in behavioral group therapy may be advantageous, because they can assist the patients during their treatment. This form of treatment may become an attractive and cost-effective alternative to conventional group settings. ","1819":"Experiences with psychoeducational groups have been extensively reported for schizophrenic patients and their families. For patients with affective disorders, however, only a few publications exist. We describe results and conclusions for clinical practice with a type of psychoeducational group that addresses family members of in-patients treated at a specialized depression ward. The group sessions are every other week and we try to take up the questions asked by the attenders in order to concentrate on their personal needs. Protocols of 40 group sessions over 18 months were analysed concerning attendance figures, degree of relatedness to the patient, main topics and questions, and emotional condition of the participants. The 40 group sessions were attended by 400 participants (mean = 10; median = 9). About 50 % of them were spouses. For the other family members, there was a clear association between female patients and female attenders. Main question was how to deal with the patient, at present and after discharge. With regard to the emotional state, 23 % were under strain themselves, 7 % were skeptical and 23 % could be described as relieved. This kind of group reaches a considerable number of family members, who in general highly appreciate these sessions. The therapeutic team also benefits from enlarging their knowledge by including the relatives' perspective. Therefore, the effort for preparing and holding the group session seems to be justified and rewarding. To our opinion, good attendance figures can be reached by personal invitation of the relatives and by being flexible and oriented towards their needs. ","1820":"To present a systemic family therapy approach for children with psychiatric disorders, based on multiple family therapy principles and employing video-feedback and peer review techniques. Children and their parents together attend a family day clinic for periods of between 3 and 14 weeks. We report on conceptual and clinical work, with case examples and discussion of a pilot study. At 6 months follow-up there are symptomatic and behavioural improvements in 75 % of the children and 90 % of the parents. Active involvement of parents in the therapy of their children appears to lead to better and longer lasting treatment results. Extensive interdisciplinary work between adult and child psychiatric services is needed, particularly with the more severe spectrum of parental psychiatric disorders. ","1821":"A focused review of a selected part of research on psychotic parents' children is being provided. The paper presents a general survey of high-risk-studies followed by a critical discussion of some of the research being done about the relatives of psychotic people. This discussion is inspired and guided by a crucial interest in the subjective dimension of biography. It will be shown that there is only very little research being done on the perspective of the involved people themselves. The tradition of Bleuler and Anthony, demanding a strong shift to questions of resilience and coping, is being considered only hesitatively. On the other hand, qualitative research drawing on hermeneutic methods seems to be restricted to case studies mainly. Children's capacity to integrate their experiences with a psychotic parent into their own lives very often shows up in biographic narratives. Thus it is accessible to a methodologically elaborated qualitative analysis. Considering the growing interest in children being affected by their parents' psychosis - especially in their ability to cope with their specific situation - the paper pleads for more extensive research on the biographies of these people and the narratives shaping them.

For purposes of controlled re-exposure to the patient's trauma, a hypnotherapeutic method was chosen. A significant reduction of symptoms, in particular the intrusions and the hyperarousal, was observed. Of great importance in the successful outcome of this case is the integration of hypnotherapy into a multi-dimensional treatment concept including group therapy, physical therapy and anxiety-reducing self-management therapy. This approach facilitated the development of trust and security in the patient required for the hypnotherapeutic intervention and minimized the splitting tendencies specific to borderline patients. Further discussion is centered on the difficulties arising in the context of an emergency ward setting with its high intensity atmosphere encompassing the danger of retraumatization of this special group of patients. Finally several aspects of the clinical implications of this method are addressed.","1826":"Theoretical background and first results of a vocational rehabilitation program for unemployed persons with chronic psychiatric disabilities will be presented. The aim of the program is job-placement in the regular labour market. After a 3-month preparatory period the participants were given the possibility of \"training on-the-job\" in the areas of social services, catering, and care taking activities in 12-months' rehabilitation reintegration courses in co-operation with a social service centre. In addition, a 6-months aftercare period will be included. More than one third of 34 participants (38 %) were placed in a regular employment. The results support the importance of vocational rehabilitation programs as a supplementary component of the care system of chronic mentally ill patients.

The TUBB 2000 has been developed in four steps (n = 80; n = 111; n = 104; n = 135) and covers the inpatients' satisfaction with 22 areas of psychiatric care. Three factors were extracted: \"atmosphere\", \"quality of treatment\", \"autonomy\". The relationship to the therapeutic staff was especially important for the patients. Intervention variables had no significant impact on patients' satisfaction. Answers to change oriented questions have been less variable than to a state oriented questions. The construct patients' satisfaction implies many methodological pitfalls. The TUBB 2000 can provide useful change sensitive data of patients' satisfaction with the quality of care in a psychiatric unit. It may help to increase quality of inpatient care in psychiatry.

Depressive symptoms appear significantly more often in vascular dementia than in dementia in Alzheimer's disease, but severity and profile of depressive symptomatology are independent of the etiology of dementia. The aim of this review is to help clinicians to select appropriate psychometric instruments to identify and measure depressive symptomatology in dementia. Frequently used scales are described, e.g. the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia - specific scales developed for rating severity of depression in dementia - and the Geriatric Depression Screening Scale. Methodological problems and limitations of psychopathological assessment in dementia caused by restriction of self-report, information gathered by collateral sources, manifestations of age and interference of somatic symptoms are discussed.","1830":"This study is on employment on the competitive as well as the sheltered work market of psychiatric in-patients suffering from schizophrenia or affective disorders. Furthermore it investigates the importance of characteristics of disorder and of educational and vocational background as predictors of occupation. A sample of 251 in-patients participated in a structured interview during their hospitalization. 43 % of in-patients suffering from schizophrenia and 46 % suffering from affective disorders were employed on the competitive work market during the year before index-hospitalization. Many were without any occupation too because sheltered employment was rarely used and mostly by schizophrenics (17 % vs 4 % of persons with affective disorders). Predictors of employment are past vocational experiences, education, length of past hospitalization, psychiatric diagnosis and sex. Results raise the question of deficits in providing with sheltered employment opportunities for the mentally ill and in particular for people suffering from affective disorders. Alternatives to these deficits are discussed. ","1831":"The assessment of violence risk has impact on psychiatrists' decisions not only in forensic psychiatry but concerns many aspects of civil psychiatric units, too. Within the last decade, many studies on violence have been published. The results are misinterpreted sometimes. A review about studies on in-patient violence is given. In-patient violence and violence in the community should strictly be separated concerning predictors and predictions. Predictors of community violence both for persons with major mental disorders and persons without mental illness are criminal history, male gender, younger age, and substance abuse. Psychopathological and clinical variables play a minor role. In contrast, in-patient violence is closely related to the severity of psychopathological symptoms. More detailed determinations of risk-related symptoms yield conflicting results due to inevitable problems of sample selection. The assessment of violence risk has to consider the different risk constellations for violence in institutions and in the community. Predictions of violence by individual risk variables are limited because situation-related factors are important, too.

Yet the rate of places available reaches 0.9\/1000 inhabitants, thus already exceeding the recommended number. A comprehensive investigation was started concerning all persons living in supported housing facilities. Services for psychiatric patients (n = 190) were included as well as services for homeless persons (n = 159). Only 41 % of the psychiatric patients and 31 % of the homeless people actually belonged into the region. Also among those who have been living less than one year in the facility, 45 % of the psychiatric and 67 % of the homeless persons come from outside, thus indicating, that the migration of patients is still going on. Among the homeless 69 % were mentally ill. While in the psychiatric services schizophrenic and affective psychoses were predominant, addictive disorders prevailed in the services for the homeless. It is the aim of mental health services in Upper Austria to care for the patients within their home regions. All regions are providing a fair amount of places for supported housing. Despite this a considerable number of patients keeps coming to the provincial capital. The causes and consequences of this process are discussed.

Test analysis of data of 58 patients, most of whom were schizophrenic, yielded good statistical indicators for most of the scales. Factor analyses indicated a structure of two to three components: Learning ability, social and interactional competence, and social adaptation and motivation. Test analyses yielded good coefficience for most of the scales. Further clinical application of the instrument thus seems to be promising.

Mortality has often been regarded as a measure for overall outcome and both treatment and drug policy effectiveness. The number of deaths by illegal drugs from the years 1990 - 2000 in Bavaria were analysed using statistical trend tests (Spearman rho and Kendall tau). In Bavaria in general (p = 0.014) as well as in 5 out of seven counties a significant increase in drug related mortality was found.","1840":"Our aim was to discuss referral letters with psychotic patients and to assess patients views about this proceeding and about the letters. Also patients knowledge of their diagnosis was assessed. The day after discussing the letter 80 patients were evaluated with a short questionnaire. 92 % of patients responded very positively to the discussion of the referral letter. Many patients appreciated the transparency and information and stated, that it improved the understanding of the illness and the doctor-patient-relationship. The day of hospital discharge 96 % of patients were able to name the exact diagnosis or an adequate replacement. Our results show, that the majority of psychotic patients - in contrast to previous experiences - responded very favourably to the referral letters, probably because they not only received the letter but also discussed the letter with their doctor and had the opportunity to correct false details before discharge. The encouragement of communication, the acceptance of patients as equal partners and the improvement of information, empower patients as active partners in care, which improves the course of the disease. Therefore patients should have the possibility to discuss the referral letter with their doctor. ","1841":"Privacy within psychiatric wards should be evaluated from the patient's point of view. Different aspects of privacy were assessed by a self-rating scale given to all patients of a psychiatric hospital at a qualifying date. The adjusted response rate was 74.5 %. By means of a factor analysis, four factors were extracted: Intimacy, sexual restriction, discretion, and care. A lack of discretion when entering the patient's room were reported by more than 80 % of patients, disturbances of intimacy by nearly 25 %. Disturbances by patients or staff when taking a shower were especially found bothersome. 15 % of patients reported about being touched by patients or staff against their will. Disturbances of privacy play an important role in psychiatric wards. The therapeutic team should be aware of these findings and should pay attention to preserve patient's privacy during inpatient care.

Based on the notion that traumatic experience may lead to mental disorders Oppenheim described the traumatic neurosis in 1889. Subsequently, there was an intensive discussion on different concepts until 1918. Since then, the history of psychiatric concepts of trauma in Germany has been characterised by change, repitition and discontinuity. After 1945, mental disorders following traumatic experience hardly featured in textbooks with the exception of the vaguely defined survivor syndrome. In the last 10 years, the concept of posttraumatic stress disorder as originated in the USA became dominant. Psychiatry in Germany has a long and inconsistent tradition of theories and concepts on trauma. The historical view may enrich the current debate in which the concept of posttraumatic stress disorder has been increasingly criticized.

Analysis of the data reveals a division into three groups: 1(st) patients with positive effects 69 %, 2(nd) patients with negative effects showing a deterioration of symptoms 15 %, 3(rd) patients with nonspecific reactions 16 %. Marked difficulties are found in patients with major depressive disorder, especially those with a distinctive feeling of emptiness and disturbance of body sense. Difficulties are also found in patients with personality disorders, who respond with depersonalization and\/or dissociative phenomena. Alternative therapeutic methods (body movement therapy, self-awareness training) or PMR in a modified way (single setting) should be employed for those patients.","1846":"To describe the availability of outpatient, inpatient and community based psychiatric care in 21 rural districts and 3 cities of Sachsen-Anhalt, one of the federal states of eastern Germany, with rapid changes and developments in psychiatric care over the last ten years. Information about services was obtained from files of the \"Committee for Issues of Psychiatric Care in Sachsen-Anhalt\", which was established in 1992 with six multiprofessional \"visitation groups\" to perform inspections of all institutions providing psychiatric service to the community. Reports about these regular visits followed semi-standardized protocols. The ESMS was used to classify 365 institutions visited between 1996 and 1998, and numbers of places per 100 000 inhabitants were used to compare the 24 regions of the state. The visitation protocols as the main source of information and the ESMS as a classification tool proved to be useful. The interrater-reliability was high, and the validity of the data was supported by other official statistics. Outpatient care was provided by 4 psychiatrists and 3 psychologists in private practice per 100 000 inhabitants, which is low compared to the German mean. 10 secure beds (forensic psychiatry), 48 acute beds, 13 elective beds and 13 day hospital places per 100 000 inhabitants were available for inpatient care, with a marked shortage of beds in the southern and eastern regions of the state. Non-acute non-hospital residential services with indefinite stay and 24 hour support accumulated to 240 places per 100 000, with regional differences ranging from less than 100 to more than 1000. About 80 % among the residents of these institutions were considered as suffering from \"mental retardation\", suggesting some persisting institutionalism. All other residential services taken together (time-limited or with less than 24 hour support) came to 24 places per 100 000. Sheltered workshop places corresponded to the number of persons in residential homes. Other facilities offering paid work or work-related activities were scarce; some services providing structured activity or social contact were available in urban agglomerations. The data about the frequency of contacts in outpatient and community services are limited. Psychiatric care in Germany is fragmentary, as regards providers and funding. Information collected by the \"Committee for Issues of Psychiatric Care in Sachsen-Anhalt\", taken mainly from visitation protocols, was sufficient to establish a general survey over 24 regions of this federal state. We propose to repeat this approach regularly to monitor developments in the field of social psychiatry for further planning and interventions. Overall, our results show that the aims formulated in the German \"Inquiry into Psychiatry\" (\"Psychiatrie-Enquete\") have not been fully accomplished (e.g. the preferential status of outpatient versus in-patient services). ","1847":"In Germany the attitudes towards alcohol consumption and smoking are rather heterogeneous. Although it is well accepted that both behaviours are harmful and often lead to addiction, thus far the attitudes of alcoholics to addiction-related topics have not been evaluated. In this investigation 228 alcoholics were asked to complete a questionnaire of addiction-related topics. The attitudes were rather realistic, concerning the harmful effects of alcohol. The beliefs were only slightly influenced by personal involvement (e.g. divorce). Different opinions were given as to the riskiness of illegal drugs. The attitude towards the reasons of alcoholism are most important for therapeutical decisions. Only a third of the patients believed that they themselves were responsible for their addictive behaviour while nearly half accused socioeconomical factors. The curability of their alcoholism as well as their own competence to overcome alcoholism was estimated rather realistically by the patients. The results could not be generalized since the sample mainly consisted of alcoholics who themselves sought an alcohol-specific treatment service. Furthermore the data analysis shows that about 90 % of them regarded themselves as alcoholics. Future studies have to show whether these attitudes differ from those of the general population and from alcoholics not seeking-help.

As indispensable information are valued details about actual medications, suicidality\/aggression, presenting problem, reason for referral, drug intolerance, and somatic disorders. Details concerning guardianship, previous therapy, substance misuse, relatives' telephone number, prior investigations, psychiatric diagnosis, and previous examination findings are assessed very important.

","1851":"Stimulated by Finzen's critical appraisal of the actual situation of social psychiatric research in Germany an analysis of recent publications of German authors on social psychiatric topics was carried out. Covering the years 1998 - 2000, 70 scientific journals from psychiatry and related disciplines were systematically analysed. A substantial proportion of research in social psychiatry is concentrated on a small number of research institutions. In German journals of general psychiatry papers dealing with social psychiatric topics are rarely found. By contrast in international, particularly in European journals the proportion of papers on social psychiatric topics originating from German authors is quite high as compared to papers on other topics. Applied research, especially research on mental health services, dominates the field. By contrast, basic research on social psychiatric issues is underrepresented. Studies using qualitative methods are almost missing. While, as traditionally, the research interest is still particularly focussed on schizophrenia, there are a number of papers dealing with other disorders, mainly with substance abuse disorders and affective disorders. The critique raised by Finzen is to a large extent supported by the results of our study. However, we still hesitate to agree with his pessimistic prognosis for the future of social psychiatric research in Germany.

Annual costs of treatment were assessed for a sample of 258 patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20) by means of the German version of the CSSRI. For the analysis of cost variance a regression model was computed using functional level (GAF), symptoms (BPRS 4.0), needs for care (CAN), service satisfaction (VSSS) and subjective quality of life (LQoLP) as predictors. The average yearly treatment costs for the study sample were 12 726,- DM. Costs for sheltered accommodation and for psychiatric inpatient treatment were found to be the largest elements of the entire costs followed by the costs for ambulant medications. Results of the regression analysis show that illness history, the severity of symptoms and the need for care explain the greatest proportion of variance. The standardized instruments developed in the project enable a systematic and international comparable assessment of the costs in the treatment of schizophrenic diseases. Furthermore the instruments allow to explain 38 % of the cost variance. The impact of the severity of symptoms under statistical control of the functional impairment and the needs for care suggests that an effective reduction of symptoms could lead to savings in the entire treatment costs. However, the great influence of the illness history and, irrespective of the functional impairment, the need for care show that the possibilities for cost savings in the treatment of schizophrenia are generally low.

After translation and adaptation of the Dutch version of the IEQ-EU into German, the instrument was tested in the study \"Cost-effectiveness of psychiatric service systems\". The internal consistency was tested on a sub-sample of 138 relatives and the Test-Retest-Reliability on a sub-sample of 37 relatives. The internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha) is moderate or good and slightly lower in comparison with the other European versions. With the exception of one subscale the results for the intraclass correlation coefficient are equal to the European versions.

Measuring effectiveness and quality of care became an important topic in psychiatry. Considering that objective criteria were not sufficient in the past, the subjective perspective gained growing interest. Client satisfaction is an important variable to evaluate psychiatric care. Patient satisfaction can influence treatment outcome as well as it determines the psychiatric system itself. The Italian original version of the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale (VSSS-54) was translated and adapted to the German language. The instrument has been tested in the project \"Cost-effectiveness of psychiatric service systems\". The process of development, the psychometric testing and the practical application of the German version will be presented in this paper. Additional advantages and disadvantages are discussed. As psychometric properties of the instrument correspond to conventional standards, they are comparable with the results of an international study. The drop out of items cannot be controlled, therefore analysing the data is difficult. Although the VSSS shows various methodological limitations, it is at the moment an appropriate instrument for measuring patient satisfaction in the German language.

Therefore an instrument was developed, which is suitable for the evaluation of cost of mental health care in Germany. The Client Sociodemographic and Service Receipt Inventory (CSSRI-EU), which was developed in the UK, was adapted to the German situation and for the first time used in a cost-effectiveness-analysis of mental health care. The adaptation process of the instrument and the practical application are explained and pros and cons considered. The German adaptation of the CSSRI-EU has proven effective in practical application. The instrument offers feasible solutions for many problems with the cost of mental health care.

Test-retest-reliability and inter-rater-reliability was tested with a sub-sample of 41 patients. The internal consistency and the test-retest-reliability of the German version of the CAN-EU is satisfying and slightly higher in comparison with the other European versions. The inter-rater-reliability is also satisfying but smaller in comparison with the other European versions. In general, the psychometric properties of the German version of the CAN-EU are satisfying but the lower inter-rater-reliability in comparison with the other European versions suggests that more precise coding rules for the German version of the CAN-EU must be formulated to improve the inter-rater agreement of the instrument.

A European comparison\" a German version of instruments for the assessment of needs for services (CAN-EU), service satisfaction (VSSS-EU) relatives' burden of care (IEQ-EU) and costs of psychiatric services (CSSRI-EU) was developed in close cooperation with the EPSILON Study group. The English original versions of the instruments were translated into German and a back-translation into the original language was carried out by a second translator. The back-translation was screened by the first author of the original version. The German versions of all instruments were tested for comprehensibility and practicability by means of focus groups. The internal consistency of all instruments were tested on a representative sample of 307 patients with schizophrenia according to ICD-10 F20. Test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability was tested by a sub-sample of 50 patients. Psychometric properties of the translated instruments will be presented and discussed.

In a second part we try to elucidate typical patterns of reactions and coping of relatives. On the basis of either own experience or from supervision cases, we try to elaborate reaction types of relatives of inpatients who committed suicide. Relatives as suicide survivors show reactions from shock, disbelief, grief, guilt, self-doubt, anger and relief to accusation and threat of lawsuit toward therapists. An attempt is made to subsummarize these reactions in three preliminary categories. Generally, relatives should be offered the opportunity of more than one common talk with the health care professionals.

A total of 30 in-patient suicides were found among 39 372 cases, corresponding to a mean annual suicide rate of 76 per 100 000 admissions. All suicides were committed using violent methods and took place outside the hospital in more than 75 % of the cases. Nearly 85 % of the patients were on leave or an outing. According to the logistic regression the risk of hospital suicides is significantly increased for patients with schizophrenia, a higher cumulative length of stay and a previous suicide attempt, but not suicidality or suicide attempt before index admission. Schizophrenic patients represent the high risk group for suicide in psychiatric hospital. An especially focussed prevention on this group could reduce in-patient suicide rates.

Inmate suicide rates have been increasing in many countries during the last decades, possibly reflecting a selection of highly endangered individuals with a high prevalence of mental disorders. This study investigates all suicides in all correctional institutions of Austria during the last 25 years. All available personal files of inmates who had committed suicide in the 29 Austrian prisons between January 1st, 1975, and December 31st, 1999, were analysed. Beside personal characteristics and circumstances of custody, information concerning psychiatric disorders and the inmate's history of suicidal behavior was included. 220 personal files of 250 suicides were available and included. Half of all suicides had a history of attempted suicide and 37 % had expressed suicidality. Referral to psychiatric consultants was known in 48.6 % and about 37 % received psychopharmacological treatment. Based on these frequent signs of psychiatric illness and vulnerability, possible implications of these results for psychiatric services of the correctional system to improve suicide prevention are discussed. Obvious signs of suicidality play an important role in vulnerability profiles for jail and prison suicides. Any signs of suicidality (st. p. attempted suicide, verbal suicide threat, self-harm) should have the consequence of further psychiatric care.

In 11 South German psychiatric hospitals the head of the nursing team of the ward, the therapist and the medical assistant director were asked how suicide postvention after the last suicide was handled. Suicide postvention is part of the routine in these hospitals and discussion on the issue is rather open. The members of the team confronted with suicide feel mostly sufficiently supported.

Mclntosh came to the conclusion that several unresolved issues still exist in this field of suicidology. This paper aims at giving an overview on current knowledge of the aftermath of suicide. lt shall be investigated which questions and unresolved issues in this field still remain. This leads to a description of future tasks and challenges for researchers investigating the after effects of suicide. At first, an overview on the most important aspects of current knowledge on the aftermath of suicide will be given.

How many of these issues and questions have come to a resolution after the publication of Mclntosh's bibliography shall be investigated. Upon examination of publications issued after 1995 it was found that several basic questions regarding the after effects of a suicide have not yet been answered in a satisfactory manner. To name a few, the term suicide survivor has not yet been clearly determined and reliable numbers as to how many people are bereaved by suicide do not exist. Moreover, a comprehensive theory regarding the consequences of a suicide for survivors is still lacking. Resolving these basic questions among a number of others can be seen as the main task of future research in this field.

According to this reasoning, establishing diagnoses-related groups (DRGs) ruling a prospective payment system could not only reduce lengths of stay but could also simultaneously raise hospitalization and readmission rates. This study analyses the Austrian experience after the implementation of such a payment system, the \"performance-oriented financing of hospitals\" (leistungsorientierte Krankenanstalten-Finanzierung, LKF) in 1997. Time series analyses based on the complete hospital discharge statistics of the Salzburg province were used as methods. Results showed that neither length of stay, nor hospitalization or readmission rates in psychiatry have substansially changed or deviated from their long-term trends after implementation of the LKF system. Other medical disciplines have experienced statistically significant changes.

In order to estimate the alcohol-related productivity losses through excessive morbidity, regression analysis was performed, using data from the 2(nd) Swiss Health Survey (1997). For the purpose of sensitivity analysis two approaches were used (a) Rice and b) Harwood), and all models were calculated with and without smearing-adjustment as well as with and without adjustment for confounding variables. The present study shows that small changes in method may result in major variations in the estimated total costs. In monetary terms, the indirect costs for alcohol consumption in Switzerland through excess-morbidity were estimated at between 0.119 billion Francs (model Harwood, smearing-adjusted) and 2.175 billions Francs (model Rice, adjusted for confounding variables). Since many methodological problems in estimating the indirect costs of alcohol consumption have not been adequately resolved yet, results of those studies have to be interpreted with caution.

There has been renewed debate of the efficacy and effectiveness of Lithium in long-term treatment of affective disorders. In the present paper current literature is discussed with a focus on the routine use of Lithium (effectiveness) and on cost aspects. Recent reviews have confirmed the prophylactic efficacy of Lithium in bipolar affective disorders. However, there is some evidence that effectiveness studies do not hold what efficacy research would promise. Non-compliance is likely to be a major reason for this. Lithium response rates have declined in recent studies. This may be related to diagnostic change (broader concept of affective disorders) and more widespread Lithium use. Non-compliance in patients taking Lithium is a primary factor in relapse with substantial cost effects (due to inpatient care). Current studies compare Lithium with Valproic acid\/divalproex, and find cost advantages for the latter possibly due to better compliance. A special suicide-preventive effect has only been proven for Lithium. To ensure the full prophylactic potential of Lithium compliance needs to be improved. Future studies will compare Lithium with Valproic acid\/divalproex, Carbamazepine and new treatment strategies more detailed.","1882":"","1883":"Schizophrenia is regarded as one of the most expensive mental illnesses because of its specific symptoms and characteristics. The care of schizophrenic patients consumed approx. 2 % of the total German health care expenditures in 1994, according to the scarce data provided by routine German health reporting. Despite this enormous impact, health-economical research in schizophrenia in Germany is widely neglected. While few empirical studies on direct cost of care for schizophrenic patients suggest that adequate comprehensive community care in Germany during the mid-nineties was about DM 27 000 to DM 28 000 per patient and year, there is a serious lackage of cost-effectiveness-studies, relating cost of care to outcome. Thus, the most basic data for any health care planning in schizophrenia is missing. This paper reviews the studies on cost of schizophrenia in Germany. It identifies the most serious knowledge gaps and describes the obstacles for an adequate research in this field.","1884":"Because of scarcity of resources, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in medicine increasingly have to be examined not only with regard to effectiveness but also with regard to cost-effectiveness, which means with regard to the relation between resources used and resulting outcome (however this outcome is measured).

However, economists also consider to evaluate medical interventions across heterogeneous medical conditions, in order to rank them with regard to their cost-effectiveness. Using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as outcome variable, all medical interventions examined can be ranked in QALY-League-Tables, which could serve as a basis for resource allocation decisions by health policy makers or other payers.

The main objective of the GBD approach was to inform global priority setting for health research and to influence international health policy and planning. One of the summary measures used was the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). DALYs are a common metric for fatal and non-fatal health outcomes and are based on years of life lost because of premature death (YLL) and years of life lived with disability (YLD). Thus DALYs = YLL + YLD or Burden = Mortality + Disability. Therefore, a DALY is one lost year of healthy life. The DALY methodology provides a way to link information on disease burden to cost-effectiveness analysis. This feature would assist comparative assessments.

Questions concerned terminology, diagnosis, prognosis, interventions and aetiology. A qualitative analysis of these data is presented. The terms used to describe the illness were mostly colloquial. Highly individualized and heterogeneous concepts of illness, aetiology and helpful interventions and a positive view regarding prognosis prevailed. Changes over time were limited and arbitrary.

During the observation period 393 (19,2 %) of 2049 scheduled visits were missed affecting more than half of the patients. Only a minority of patients with low-intensity treatment and a high rate of missed appointments had a high risk for discontinuing treatment. Missed appointments in outpatient psychiatric care are a common phenomenon but they constitute no major threat to the continuity of care for the majority of the patients due to the graduated efforts of the team.

Additionally, their vocational history and sociodemographic data were analysed. Before the training, only 9 % had a job, while two years after the course 42 % were employed in competitive jobs. On the other hand, using an ordinal scale, two years after the training, 78 % of the patients were found in a better job situation than before the course. Likewise, the financial situation of 52 % of the clients has improved within those two years. The strongest correlation with success was the intensity of support after the training.

NAS is characterised by tremor, irritability, hypertonicity, vomiting, sneezing, fever, poor suckling, and sometimes convulsions. Recent studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of other synthetic opioids like sublingual buprenorphine for the treatment of pregnant patients. We present a 22 year old opioid-dependent woman, who has been maintained continuously on buprenorphine for 3 years. During the treatment episode she delivered two healthy newborns and both did not show any symptoms of NAS. The maintenance therapy with buprenorphine proved safety and efficacy during pregnancy, the mother was free of continuous heroin abuse, verified through supervised urine-toxicology.

Quality of life, needs for care, patients' assessment of treatment, re-hospitalisation and characteristics of care were studied in a control-group design. After five years, 61 % of the patients continued to live in highly staffed settings (mean staff-patient-ratio: 1 : 3.5). Eleven percent had moved on to independent living and 16 % had returned into an institutional setting. Standard mortality ratios were 4.4 (all causes of death) and 62.5 (2 suicides only of schizophrenic patients). After one year patients (n = 20) showed a significant increase in satisfaction with their living situation and more social contacts. Over the longer period of time, there were also favourable changes, which failed to reach statistical significance (n = 24). Average length of inpatient stay per year of the illness was decreased significantly at both follow-ups. Interpretation of the findings is difficult because of the small sample size and selection effects. Most of the former long-stay patients appear able to live in the community with a significant decrease of time spent in hospital. Whilst patients were particularly satisfied with their accommodation at one year follow-up, this did not lead to a generalised improvement in subjective quality of life and other subjective criteria in the long term. In line with other recent studies on community mental health care one may conclude that small case loads alone do not have major beneficial effects. Further research should evaluate more systematic and targeted models of mental health care in the community in general and of supported housing in particular.

Our achieved knowledge permits our to present criteria how to combine these drugs and psychotherapy successfully. ","1910":"Aim of the study is the analysis of the psychiatrists' evaluation of the impact of a psychoeducative group programme on patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, which was part of the project \"Integrated Treatment of Schizophrenia\". Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 20 psychiatrists involved in outpatient treatment of patients who participated in the psychoeducative programme. Interviews were analysed by means of qualitative content analysis. For some patients psychiatrist noticed positive changes of the awareness for early signs of psychosis, the illness behaviour and their attitudes regarding their disorder. Although only some of the psychiatrists believe that psychoeducation has a direct impact on the reduction of relapse rates and the necessity of inpatient episodes, most of them regard the observed effects as an important improvement of the patients' ability to cope with their disorder. The effectiveness of psychoeducational programmes should not only be assessed by their impact on the reduction of relapse rates and health service cost but also by its contribution to the patients' quality of life. The integration of psychoeducational programmes into existing outpatient services seems to be an important task of future service planning. ","1911":"","1912":"","1913":"At the General Hospital in Thun (Switzerland) a memory clinic was established in 1999. The first 55 cases (30 females and 25 males) were statistically analysed as a part of internal quality management. The patients were examined using a usual assessment including physical and psychiatric examination, blood and neuropsychological testing (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale). 14% of the examined patients did show kind of cognitive deficit. Men yielded significantly better results in neuropsychological testing than women. The general acceptance of the new memory clinic in Thun is due to the growing demand for such institutions because of the demographic development. Men's better results in neurological testing might be a sign of different reaction-patterns of their families, that make family practitioners send them at an earlier stage of dementia. ","1914":"Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adulthood is frequently overlooked. Motor restlessness, impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and conduct disorders are diagnostically ambiguous, but are predominantly ascribed to affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Furthermore, substance-induced addiction may develop consecutively to untreated ADHD. We report on a case of primary diagnosis of ADHD in adulthood with secondary cocaine dependency, who was neuropsychologically assessed before and following treatment with methylphenidate. Frequency of errors and reaction time in performance on attention tests, concentration tasks, and multiple stimuli-\/reaction tasks improved under treatment with methylphenidate. ADHD may be treated efficiently even after primary diagnosis in adulthood. Differential diagnosis of ADHD should be considered in disorders associated with motor hyperactivity, impulsivity, stress intolerance and conduct disorders.","1915":"We report a case of an 18 year old female Turkish patient, who was suffering from psychogenic seizures. The family did not accept the disease, prohibited treatment by a medical doctor, preferred to bring her to a Hoca. She was maltreated by her father und sexually abused at the age of eight years by her brother. In this article we describe the problems of a psychiatric ill female patient within a family of Turkish origin.","1916":"Heautoscopy is a well-known phenomenon in clinical psychopathology. Strictly speaking it is not a syndrome but a symptom and can be associated with different kinds of mental illness. Our case report deals with an atypical form of heautoscopy. We try to elucidate the essential qualities of our patient's disturbing mental experiences. In addition, we present a psychodynamic approach which seeks to explain the patient's experiences in terms of projection and protective functions.","1917":"34 chronically schizophrenic persons were matched with 34 healthy control participants according to age, level of education, and sex and received memory tests (short-term, priming, working, prospective, episodic, source and semantic long-term memory) and tests of attention and intelligence. Patients performed worse on all tests. The patients' memory deficits compared with controls are nearly one standard deviation greater than the differences in attention and intelligence. The deficits are smaller for priming and semantic long-term memory than for short-term, working, prospective, episodic, and source memory. After one short instruction all patients and controls received a repeat administration of the tests. Patients showed a lower, but also significant improvement for short-term, working, and prospective memory. We conclude that schizophrenia patients might suffer from specific memory deficits (specific vulnerability of strategic and thus of interference- or context-sensitive memory tasks) not attributable to more general psychopathologic symptoms.","1918":"According to a quantitative study on causal beliefs patients with functional psychoses favour psychosocial over biological explanations. They also tend to endorse a multicausal concept. The aim of this study is to try to replicate these findings using semiqualitative methods. Problem-centered interviews were conducted with 78 schizophrenic patients consecutively discharged from inpatient or dayhospital treatment. As in the previous study, patients provided more frequently psychosocial explanations. Biological causes were relatively rarely mentioned--mostly in response to suggestions of the interviewer. In addition, they were rather brief and not very elaborated. By contrast to the previous study, hardly any indications for a multicausal concept could be observed. Patients' beliefs are contrasted with the results of psychiatric research on the causes of schizophrenia. ","1919":"Aim of the study is an analysis of the patients' evaluation of the impact of a psychoedukative group program for patients with schizophrenia in outpatient treatment, which was part of the project \"Integrated Treatment of Schizophrenia\". Problem-focussed interviews were carried out with 30 randomly selected participants of the psychoeducative group programme. Interviews were fully transcribed and analysed by means of qualitative content analysis. With the exception of two persons all patients made a very positive assessment of their participation at the psychoeducative programme. The quality of the information received and the possibilities of exchanging experiences with other patients during the group sessions were mentioned by most of the participants as reasons for this positive assessment. Although only few patients reported on changes of their illness behaviour due as a result of psychoeducation, most of them underlined that that the increase of their illness-related wisdom as well as the exchange of illness experiences with other patients helped them to cope somewhat better with their illness. Psychoeducative group programmes contribute to the improvement of patients quality of life even if they have no measurable impact on illness behaviour or compliance. Hence, such group programmes should be integrated into outpatient services even if there is no evidence of a direct impact on relapse rates or cost savings. ","1920":"The study aimed at assessing burnout in psychiatrists and psychiatric residents, all of them working in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, and at identifying some of its correlates. Potentially burnout- related demographic, work, leisure activities, and personality (Munich Personality Test) variables were studied in three subgroups of 307 probands--psychiatric residents, psychiatrists working as staff members or in leading positions in psychiatric institutions, and psychiatrists working in private practice--the degree of burnout having been assessed with the Tedium Measure (TM). The mean TM score of all probands of 2.9 (SD = 0.7) was on a low level, high TM scores (&gt; 3.5) were indicated by 57 (18%) participants. Significantly higher TM scores were indicated by psychiatric residents, who also scored higher with regard to neuroticism and lower with regard to frustration tolerance on MPT. Neuroticism alone explained a substantial proportion of the total TM variance in individual groups. Work-related variables turned out to be of a small importance only, whereas no influence could be demonstrated for different leisure activities. ","1921":"How can patients and staff participate in redesigning psychiatric procedures through survey research? Using interviews with circular-hypothetical questioning, 58 patients and 30 staff members of a psychiatric department of a general hospital were interviewed about their preferences for change and continuity in clinical practices, and results were feedbacked. Suggestions for change concerning doctors' rounds, the integration of music therapy, the number of individual sessions and the postdischarge care initiated real change. Surveys planned cooperatively with staff and without competitive benchmarking can be effective tools in psychiatric organization development. ","1922":"The following review concludes the authors experience of a 6 year consultation with the parents of a 28 year old daughter with a schizophrenic psychosis. The self-sacrificing experiences of the parents are reported as well as the experiences with a well developed system of psychiatric care with several professionals, whose work remains without success because of insufficient coordination. The author asks for a conference of all involved persons, to nominate a responsible therapeutic key-worker to coordinate the different psychiatric care in the future.","1923":null,"1924":"To assess attitudes of relatives of mentally ill patients to psychiatric research, especially to early detection of schizophrenic psychosis, and to evaluate the potential stigmatization effect of an early diagnosis of schizophrenic psychosis. A questionnaire was sent to relatives of mentally ill patients, all members of a self-help group in Switzerland. They were asked to answer structured questions about their personal attitude to psychiatric research in general, their willingness to support an affected person to participate in a research project, their attitude to early detection of schizophrenia and to the potential stigmatization of an early diagnosis. 88% of the relatives (n = 200) have a positive attitude to research in psychiatry. 47% would support their affected family member to participate in a research project whereas 39% would not. 52.5% fully share the expectation of psychiatric research to attain a better course by earlier detection of psychosis, 24.5% tend to agree. 20.5% of the respondents indicate a fear of stigmatization for the affected by earlier diagnosis, while 12% fear stigmatization for themselves. A surprising fact is the positive attitude of relatives to psychiatric research in general, but also to early detection of schizophrenic psychosis. But this cannot lead to the conclusion that relatives are supporting the participation of an affected family member in research. The small number of relatives that fears a stigmatization by earlier diagnosis of schizophrenic psychosis shows that stigmatization depends on other factors than the diagnosis, i.e. psychiatric hospitalization or medication side effects. These findings encourage psychiatric research to increase knowledge of the early phase of schizophrenia in favor of patients and their relatives. ","1925":"In a former quantitative study on relatives' beliefs about the causes of functional psychoses a preference for psychosocial explanations was found. There were also indications of an inclination towards a multicausal concept. The aim of this study is to try to replicate these findings using semi-qualitative methods. In addition, we are interested in knowing to what extent the causal beliefs of relatives are similar to those of the patients. Problem-centered interviews were conducted with 31 relatives of schizophrenic patients. A computer-assisted qualitative content analysis was carried out with the transcripts of the interviews. As in the previous study, relatives showed a strong propendency to endorse psychosocial explanations. However, among only one third a multicausal concept could be observed. The causal beliefs of relatives and patients were quite similar. The findings are discussed with reference to the concept of subjective illness theory and the concept of social representations. ","1926":"The aim of this study was to investigate how spouses of schizophrenic patients experience the onset of the disease. Based on the narrative analysis of 23 in-depth interviews, the article highlights different aspects of this stressful life event. The first episode of a schizophrenic disorder leads to severe distress in the spouse of the patient. Emotions of fear, despair and loss of control are especially pronounced if spouses feel that neither their information about the disease nor their supportive resources are sufficient. The illness is often viewed as an existential threat to marriage and family life. Supportive services for spouses of schizophrenic patients should be offered very closely to the onset of schizophrenia, because the situation is especially burdensome in this period. Interventions should meet the particular needs of spouses. In addition to information about the illness and coping strategies intervention programs should consider issues which are relevant for partnership and parenting roles. ","1927":"In contrast to previous high-risk studies of children of parents suffering from psychosis a new approach to the difficulties of affected children will be tested, using the linguistic and narrative tools of biography studies. The transcribed texts of biographical interviews of affected children will be analysed linguistically and hermeneutically through \"close reading\". The linguistic and interpretative study of these texts will demonstrate the children's specific problem of identity-formation and their construction of reality and biography through the order of language (as shown by their uses of metonymy and metaphor). By using the method of biographical research a) the creative potential of patients and their children is exposed, b) a qualified view of mental illnesses can be reached in the field of symbolic practice. ","1928":"Described are mother-child treatments performed within the framework of regional maximum care at general psychiatric units not having such a treatments focus. The new clinical concept with its social and psychodynamic aspects is described. It provides realistic perspectives for all involved. Last but not least it puts the child in a position as a helpful companion for the mother. Over a space of 5 years, 20 mother-child treatments were performed at four different wards. 12 mothers suffered from schizophrenia (F20), 7 had depressive complaints (F32, F43), and one patient had a borderline personality disorder (F60). Treatments lasted an average of 10 weeks, all mothers retained their children. 16 patients were sent home; 2 were referred to a mother-child facility; 1 patient was placed in a half-way home and another in a house for women, in both cases with offspring. Mother-child treatment under specific spatial conditions is not only possible, but is an enrichment for all at general psychiatric units attending heterogeneous patients. The main requirement is a certain level of treatment care, such as an established primary care track, a clinic team that is flexible and open to novel approaches and, as a result, willing to accept a certain level of stress as normal. ","1929":"This study aimed to examine attitudes, knowledge about disease and needs of relatives of schizophrenic patients. Questions concerning needs and wishes addressed to professionals were added to the \"Questionnaire of attitudes concerning disease for relatives\". The questionnaire was distributed to relatives participating in the workshop at Bezirksklinikum Regensburg and sent by post to non-participating relatives. The relatives of both groups were predominantly comparable regarding attitudes, knowledge and needs. Mainly they wished more dialogue with therapists. Information about schizophrenia was assessed as very important. Relatives participating in the workshop reported significantly more frequently that the atmosphere in the family is strained and that they understand the nature of the illness less than non-participating relatives. They reproached themselves more frequently, but felt less depressive than non-participating relatives. 95% of the participating relatives were satisfied or very satisfied with the workshop. They assessed self-help groups for relatives of schizophrenics as more important than non-participating relatives. Workshops for relatives of schizophrenic patients have proved to be economic and well accepted to contact many relatives and to give attention to their problems. ","1930":"Covers two years experience of family visits (FV) as a routine fixture at a psychiatric ward in a General Hospital. In the course of one year 98 visits took place involving a total of 481 contacts between therapists, patients, and relatives. 269 patients participated up to 10 times in FV. A total of 666 family members participated, the bulk of them partners, mothers and children. Each FV contact is restricted to 20 minutes, but can be repeated as often as desired. An ever recurrent theme is the question family members ask as to the causes of the patients condition and how they can expedite the healing process and ensure compliance. The 269 FV patients do not differ markedly from the other patients concerning age, sex, diagnosis and treatment time. FV are experienced by patients and relatives as positiv and enriching. For psychiatric workers an ideal way to learn the psychotherapeutic rudiments. ","1931":"A review of the findings in the research literature on the effect of mental illness on other members of the patient's family is provided. This article critically examines the research to date with special reference to the conceptual and operational definitions of burden and methodological issues. The burdens of caring for a patient at home are considerable throughout different patient groups. Relatives' experience of burden is influenced by their cognitive appraisal of the situation and their psychosocial resources of coping with it. Research findings suggest that information and support provided by clinicians can alleviate caregiver burden, although it has been used too rarely in clinical routine. Finally, the review identifies advances made in this line of research in recent years and highlights areas that need further attention in future research work. Systematic research of families' responses to and management of mental illness should move beyond the more global concept of family and address the great diversity among families with mentally ill relatives. Furthermore, given the lack of consensus regarding the theoretical conceptualizing of the burden concept a new framework with reference to stressrelated research is suggested. ","1932":"","1933":"A case of a kleptomaniac with frontal lobe dysfunction is presented. Kleptomania is related to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders and the affective spectrum disorders. In obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders neuroimaging and neuropsychological tasks have revealed abnormal functioning in the frontal brain which also could be related to kleptomania. Consolidated findings from animal and human studies have implied central serotonergic transmission in the genesis of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders and affective spectrum disorders. Altogether, these results suggest that kleptomania, like other disorders of the above mentioned spectrums, could have an abnormality in serotonergic transmission in common.","1934":"Following mainly the patients' view, the study examines whether the treatment of gerontopsychiatric patients in common with younger patients in a general psychiatric ward might entail disadvantages. Out of a total of 297 gerontopsychiatric patients treated in 1999, a group of 107 patients was asked via a self-constructed questionnaire about different aspects of common treatment with younger patients. With the exception of an underrepresentation of organic disorders, the 107 interviewed patients did not differ substantially in basic characteristics from the entire group of gerontopsychiatric patients treated in 1999. Life together with younger patients was judged predominantly positively. The older patients themselves rejected the often stated complaint that nurses would neglect the gerontopsychiatric patients on age-mixed wards. Neither objective facts nor the subjective judgement by the users point to assume that common treatment of gerontopsychiatric patients together with younger patients could be disadvantageous. The contrary seems to be the case. ","1935":"The early recognition of dementia assumes increasing importance. Lay beliefs on the causes of loss of memory play a major part in this regard as they have shown to determine help-seeking behaviour. 720 persons aged 75 or older were questioned on their beliefs on the causes of cognitive deficits in the context of the Leipzig Longitudinal Study of the Aged (LEILA 75+). Almost one-third of the respondents mentioned exclusively biological causes, vascular lesions coming first. One quarter of those questioned ascribed memory deficits to non-biological factors. Every tenth person suspected that they result from a combination of both. One quarter of the elderly did not know any answer. The results are contrasted with outcomes of epidemiological dementia research. It is argued that increasing and better quality information of the public are urgently required. ","1936":"The process of aging has been generally associated with cognitive dedine. However, some complex cognitive abilities, such as wisdom and judgement, have been suggested to improve with age. In the current study, the development of an advanced artistic ability is examined over the life span of Rembrandt H. van Rijn. Analysis of the paintings revealed the development of an old-age-style in the last portrait, characterised by uniformity of texture, facture, and lighting. The self-portrait painted in the last year of Rembrandt's life reflects a high degree of integration of artistic skill and experience gathered in the course of life, and hence reflects features of wisdom in the sence suggested by Baltes. The development of a mature \"late\" style can help to characterise the emergence of qualitatively different and advanced cognitive abilities in old age.","1937":"The history, motivation and consequences of the New York State \"Kendra's Law\" as of August 1999 are reviewed. \"Kendra's Law\" was the consequence of the killing of a young woman, Kendra W., by a schizophrenic patient later convicted for second degree murder. Before, he had been repeatedly rejected when he sought treatment in state-run psychiatric facilities and was expelled several times from long-term hospitals despite a long history of violent behaviour when untreated. \"Kendra's Law\" now entitles physicians, case workers, roommates and families of untreated mentally ill persons to seek a court order forcing a patient to comply with treatment and, at the same time, compelling mental health institutions to grant this treatment. Additionally, the law and another bill signed in November 1999 provided for additional funding for the underfinanced state-run mental health system. \"Kendra's Law\" illustrates a bidirectional attempt to cope with the revolving door treatment situation of mentally ill in the State of New York by additional funding and additional possibilities to enforce treatment. The law illustrates the fundamental conflict between individual autonomy and the need for treatment of people suffering from severe mental illness. ","1938":"The in-patient treatment of migrants with psychiatric disorders causes particular difficulties. There is often a barrier of language and culture that raises problems for the diagnostic and therapeutic process. To solve these problems we developed a bilingual setting by integrating a Turkish psychologist who belongs to a counselling centre into our therapeutic team for at least once a week. This offers the possibility for a very qualified psychopathological assessment as the patient can talk to the Turkish psychologist in his native language and the Turkish psychologist can translate this and his own impression accurately also using the psychiatric language. All relevant themes can be discussed, including the possibility of continuing the therapy in the counceling centre. We investigated the impact of this kind of therapeutic approach on the duration of hospitalisation, remission in terms of psychopathology, rehabilitation level, ratio of readmission and contentment with therapy. The migrants were divided into two groups: Turkish migrants were treated in this special setting, non Turkish migrants were not treated in the manner described. There are shorter periods of hospital treatment for Turkish non-schizophrenic in-patients and Turkish schizophrenic patients achieve higher levels of rehabilitation. Turkish patients with all kinds of psychiatric diagnoses show lower ratios of readmission and express greater contentment with therapy. The psychopathological symptoms themselves, however, are not substantically reduced in this special setting.","1939":"Besides pronounced deficiencies in psychiatric research concerning homeless mentally ill in Germany, studies concerned with the quality of life of homeless mentally ill were missing until now. This study reveals in a representative sample of 102 homeless people from the City of Mannheim, Germany that--compared to the homeless without psychiatric disorders of the sample--the mentally ill homeless (prevalence 68.6%) have significantly different subjective views of their quality of life regarding the items \"state of health\", \"physical capabilities\" and \"support from others\". The differences were even stronger if the homeless mentally ill were compared to a group of non-homeless mentally ill schizophrenic patients (n = 104), cared for in the City's well-equipped community care services. Community care patients reported a significantly better quality of life in respect of 11 items. These results were seen as a success of the concept of community-based mental health care. The consequences for improving care strategies for homeless mentally ill are discussed.","1940":"Since 1996 three psychiatric hospitals have been working together closely in a team aiming at improving the quality management of coercive measures. The first comparison of documented restraints showed conspicuous differences in incidence and duration. Due to this, the group decided to document and to compare the incidence, duration and reason of restraints and the legal status and sociodemographic variables in the three hospitals over one year. Considerable deviations were found with regard to the number and duration of restraints and number of patients concerned. Hospital A (2622 admissions) registered 103 restraints of 53 persons whereas hospital B (5802 admissions) reported 254 restraints of 121 persons, hospital C (4252 admissions) finally, documented 621 restraints of 120 persons. Hypotheses giving reason for these findings are discussed. Furthermore, developments and changes aiming at reducing coercive measures and at complete and comparative documentation by co-operation of the three hospitals, are reported.","1941":"Primarily from the perspective of psychopharmacology, schizophrenic symptomatology has recently been dichotomized into \"plus\" and \"minus\" symptoms, although the role of cognitive dysfunctions has been regarded as particularly important for the diagnosis since the time of Eugen Bleuler. Many studies show that schizophrenic patients suffer consistently from cognitive dysfunction. Among these, are impairments of attention and memory functions as well as executive functions such as planning and problem solving. These impairments are stable or progressive and often continue into the remission phase of schizophrenia and impair both social integration as well as occupational performance. In this overview, research results on cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenic illnesses and their relation to psychosocial disabilities are described first. The therapeutic value and possible clinical-practice implications of atypical anti-psychotics and various cognitive therapy methods are then presented. Methodological weaknesses and open questions, both pharmacological and with regard to cognitive interventions, are discussed.","1942":null,"1943":"","1944":"","1945":"","1946":"Though frequently misinterpreted, gastrointestinal complaints are among the most common psychosomatic syndromes. The following report describes the case-history of a 60-year old woman, hospitalized for recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhoea. During the course of parallel internal and psychosomatic examinations an organic cause could be excluded and the psychogenesis of the complaints identified. Once the diagnosis of a somatoform disorder had been established the symptoms were successfully treated within the framework of in-patient psychotherapy. Anxiety and depressive disorder are often masked as abdominal pain. If detected, they can be successfully treated using a psychotherapeutic approach. Thus this article also points to the great importance of the availability of a psychosomatic consultation-liaison-service within general hospitals. ","1947":"Depression is a common problem in neurological rehabilitation. Although three double-blind studies have shown the efficacy of trazodone, citalopram and nortriptyline, antidepressant drug therapy of poststroke depression is not yet considered a state-of-the-art strategy. In a hospital for neurological rehabilitation we have performed an open study on the effects of the SSRI, paroxetine, in depressive disorders caused by neurological diseases. 111 consecutive admissions were screened for depression and 9 patients were admitted to the study having a HDRS score &gt; or = 14. 10-40 mg of paroxetine were well tolerated and led to a &gt; or = 50% reduction of the HDRS score in 8\/9 patients. A patient with pathological crying, but without depression, was also successfully treated with 20 mg of paroxetine. We conclude that the SSRI, paroxetine, is an effective and well-tolerated therapy of depressive disorders caused by various neurological diseases, including also other diagnoses than stroke. ","1948":"The study was intended to provide information on the frequency and general condition of inpatient and outpatient treatment of mentally disturbed prisoners in general psychiatry in Germany. Directors of psychiatric institutions and chief physicians of prisons in Nordrhein-Westfalen and Rheinland-Pfalz were interviewed via a standardized questionnaire. The use of inpatient psychiatric treatment was approximately 0.1 to 2.3% in 1997 with reference to the total admissions in 1997. The rare use of psychiatric beds in general psychiatry may reflect obstacles concerning the status of prisoners and reservations regarding difficult patients. ","1949":"We discuss the history of \"agoraphobia\" and related descriptions as the \"Platzangst\" from M. Benedikt and the artile of E. Cordes, who used the same title \"agoraphobia\" as Westphals original paper. It is remarkable that Westphal and Cordes recognized the psychological character of the phenomenon, whereas Benedikt in 1870 suspected a neuroophthalmological origin for his \"Platzschwindel\". Regarding the details of these first three descriptions one can show that the primary authorities set up a discussion, which is still going on: The relation between agoraphobia, dizziness, fear and panic is until now object of many controversies, as shown in the final chapter.","1950":"In contemporary concepts of affective psychoses the existence of monopolar manias is widely questioned. Nevertheless, cases of manias with monomorphous symptomatology are reported repeatedly from all over the world. Based upon subtle observation of signs and course over many years, Karl Leonhard developed a concept of affective psychoses that permits a distinction of monopolar from bipolar forms, e.g. monopolar manias and euphoric euphorias. As an example for the pure forms of euphorias we present two cases of hypochondriacal euphoria. We discuss some of the literature relevant to the issue and propose the application of a differentiated psychopathological analysis for the discrimination of monopolar from bipolar manias. ","1951":"An attempt was made to examine the relationship between different dimensions of aggression and suicidal behavior in clinical and non-clinical subjects. A clinical sample of 68 suicide attempters (39 females, 29 males) and a matched sample of 70 non-clinical subjects (38 females, 32 males) were subgrouped by cluster analytic techniques. Classification variables included the scales of the Aggressive Factors Questionnaire (AFQ). Discriminant function analyses were performed on the clusters to determine the quality of group separation and to assess the power of each input variable. External variables such as the amount of hopelessness, suicidal ideation and the number of suicide attempts were used to assess the clinical relevance of the identified clusters. Two subgroups were identified in each sample. Variables that contributed most to group separation were Auto-aggression\/Depression and Spontaneous Aggression in the non-clinical sample and Excitability in the clinical sample, respectively. The clusters identified within the non-clinical sample differentiated between ideators and non-ideators. Cluster allocation within the clinical sample was indicative of the number of suicide attempts. Clusters defined on the basis of different dimensions of aggressiveness turned out to be a classification with significant implications for the assessment of suicidal behavior. ","1952":"To assess the eating behaviour, quality of life and changes in life style in 46 female patients with eating disorders, discharged from our psychosomatic unit at least six month ago. Patients meeting the criteria for DSM-IV anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa completed the \"Lancashire Quality of Life Profile\" [16] and a questionnaire covering demographic aspects, eating behaviour and changes in life style. Positive changes in eating behaviour correlated with higher quality of life scores in many of the domains assessed, including leisure, financial situation and perceived mental health. These changes also correlated with positive changes in life style in several domains, in particular family situation and leisure activities. Results show that various connections between eating behaviour and quality of life as well as life style exist, suggesting a treatment concept that emphasizes both clinical symptoms and psycho-social conflicts. ","1953":"After the German reunification the deinstitutionalisation of long-term hospitalised psychiatric patients and the restructuring of the complementary psychiatric care has become necessary in the \"new\" German states. Hereby it became possible to offer alternative residential settings and new community-oriented care programmes for the mentally disabled. Ten years after the beginning of this process we analysed the impact of the housing conditions and the subjective satisfaction of 245 chronic schizophrenic patients living in different residential care-settings or with family resp. on their own in the Dresden region. Additionally we asked for the satisfaction with the organisation of the deinstitutionalisation process. The subgroups--defined by the residential setting--differ in sociodemographic variables and in the levels of psychopathology (PANSS) and social disabilities (DAS-M). It is shown how deficiencies and restrictions of the living situation and the deinstitutionalisation process are reflected in the respective judgments of the patients especially referring to autonomy and self-determination. Requirements for the further development of the complementary psychiatric care system are deduced. ","1954":"","1955":"","1956":"","1957":"The present paper initially discusses the possible transitions existing between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and delusional disorder. With respect to the latter, the main focus is on the psychopathological concept of the so-called sensitive delusion of reference. A patient who developed a delusional disorder secondary to PTSD, which had been precipitated by his involvement in a serious auto accident, is then described. The details of this case seem to lend some support to the hypothesis of a clinical continuum provided that the \"trauma\" found in PTSD, on the one hand, and the \"crucial experience\" associated with the sensitive delusion of reference, on the other, positively correlate with the presence of prominent sensitive traits of personality.","1958":"The need for psychiatric crisis services is generally accepted. Additional to traditional crisis clinics which are located in general or psychiatric hospitals in recent years also special community crisis services were implemented. The question is whether there are differences in patients and type of care between traditional and new services. In this study empirical data are reported on reasons for contact, on patients and on interventions for a hospital based crisis clinic and a community crisis service. 132 service and 364 clinic contacts were recorded. There were more neurotic patients in the community service and more psychotic patients in the clinic. In both services inpatient care had to be arranged in one third of the cases. In the hospital based crisis service fewer legal commitments were necessary. A speciality of the community crisis service is the possibility to look after patients in their homes. Both services have similar features, but there are also differences which show that the new service offers new possibilities of care. ","1959":"The present study, which falls back on data collected within an extensive evaluation of indoor psychiatric ergotherapy, aims at the investigation of the interaction between patients' satisfaction and patients' characteristics, duration of treatment, and patients' assessments of specific single treatment aspects. Fifty-eight inpatients assigned to three ergotherapeutic treatment programs were included into study. Assessments included--among others--a German version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire as well as a 74-items questionnaire on specific treatment aspects, such as perceived support, perceived practical orientation, and perceived personal problem orientation. As expected, a high level of satisfaction with treatment was reported. Patients' satisfaction is correlated with some variables under study, such as patients' subjective well-being and patients' assessments of psychosocial and professional treatment aspects. Findings indicate that--for the purpose of high patient satisfaction--ergotherapeutic treatment programs should distinguish themselves by supportive therapists, practical orientation, and personal problem orientation. ","1960":"We investigated whether older patients are disadvantaged compared to younger patients on admission to a psychiatric clinic. Using odds ratio and Mantel-Haenszel statistics, the null hypothesis is tested of whether patients over sixty-five years old who do not live in the sector of the catchment area of a psychiatric clinic have the same changes of admission as patients over sixty-five who live in this sector. Older sector patients and younger non-sector patients are preferentially admitted compared to older non-sector patients. The odds ratio of the particular groups deviated highly significantly from 3.83, thus refuting the null hypothesis. Younger patients are preferentially admitted by the clinical psychiatrist. ","1961":"The subjective experience of catatonic patients was investigated with the repertory grid-technique after recovery from the acute state of disease and compared with non-catatonic schizoaffective and depressive patients. The sample consists of 18 catatonic patients, 22 schizoaffective, 16 unipolar depressive, 8 unipolar manic and 23 patients with bipolar affective disorder as well as of 32 psychiatrically healthy orthopaedic controls. Interviews were held well before discharge. The contents of personal constructs was analyzed by means of modified Landfield categories. \"Self\" of catatonic patients did not differ significantly from the other groups. The \"Idealself\" of catatonic patients differed significantly in the categories \"high self esteem\" (from the controls and the non-catatonic group) and \"high empathy\" (from the controls). The \"disease-self\" (\"In the acute catatonic state\") was construed as isolated (lack of social contact). The results underline the importance of an active therapeutical interaction in the acute catatonic state. The modified Landfield Categories proved to be a useful psychodiagnostic instrument for the idiographic assessment of personality in particular, and for psychiatric therapy research in general. ","1962":"The task profile of social work in (acute) inpatient psychotherapy--unlike psychiatric inpatient treatment--is only fragmentarily described by the so-called Psychiatrie-Personalverordnung (Psych-PV). The aim of the present investigation was, therefore, to provide valid and representative data to define its respective scope of duties. During a prospective one-year assessment at the Department of Psychotherapy and Behavioral Medicine at the Philipps-University of Marburg\/Germany, we recorded corresponding data of social work referring to three areas of interest, i.e., \"education and occupation\", \"housing and family\", and \"psychotherapy support\". Our data suggest a broad overlap with the corresponding task profile of social work at psychiatric hospitals, which clearly differs, however, from the more therapeutical approach in social work as practiced in Anglo-American countries. Our findings stress the need for a re-evaluation of social work in inpatient psychotherapy concerning its specific task profile and the respective time values. ","1963":null,"1964":"The aim of this study is the prediction of specific factors associated with utilization patterns of mental health care. Course of treatment of 272 out-patients and in-patients was observed for one year. Patients were asked five times (baseline, 1 month, 3, 6, and 12 months) about their utilization behavior. 71% of the patients continued treatment, 6% ended treatment in agreement with their therapists, and 23% dropped out of treatment. 24 patients of those who dropped out, i.e. 38% of this subgroup, returned to treatment during the one year period. Multivariate analyses indicate that continuity of treatment is associated with referrals from other institutions, male gender, the diagnosis of functional psychosis, high subjective well-being, and poor social functioning. First-time use of the corresponding institution, in-patient status, and living alone are predictors of treatment-dropout. Patients who ended treatment in agreement with their therapists are the best socially integrated group. Drop-outs who returned to treatment during the one year period have more unfavorable clinical premises, and are less well integrated socially than drop-outs who do not take up their treatment again. Therapeutic interventions, such as permanent efforts towards the maintenance of a supportive therapeutic relationship, motivate psychiatric patients to keep a continuing treatment-alliance. Well functioning communication between, or rather coordination of out-patient and in-patient treatment increases the chance of a continuous course of treatment. ","1965":"In clinical as well as in forensic practice biological state markers of high sensitivity and specificity capable of monitoring alcohol consumption of those in treatment for alcohol dependence or poly-drug abusers are required. The known markers cannot be considered satisfactory in respect of these parameters. Furthermore, they do not cover the entire time axis for alcohol consumption. These traditional markers are often influenced besides by alcohol, by age, gender and various of substances and non-alcohol-associated diseases. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a non volatile, water soluble, stable upon storage, direct metabolite of ethanol with a molecular weight of 222 g\/mol that was determined by our group in more than 1200 samples of body fluids, tissues and hair from over 200 patients, almost 200 drivers and postmortem with different GC\/MS and ESI-LC\/MS-MS methods using deuterium-labelled EtG as internal standard. With its specific time frame of detection intermediate between short-term and long-term markers and a particularly high sensitivity and specificity, ethyl glucuronide is a promising marker of alcohol consumption in general that can be detected for an extended time period after the complete elimination of alcohol from the body (up tp 80 h) and a marker for relapse control enabling the therapist to intervene at an early stage of relapsing behaviour. The complementary use of EtG together with other upcoming markers of alcohol consumption like phosphatidyl ethanol should lead to an improvement in treatment outcome, quality of life and cost reduction.","1966":"","1967":"","1968":"In a case report we describe an 18 year old Croat refugee with a first episode schizophrenia to discuss the current German laws for foreigners as a possible factor for the maintenance of the disease. Short residence permits, the release of the professional discretion to the authorities, deficient information about the laws and the unclear situation in the native country of the patients can lead to a worst course and prognosis of the disease.","1969":"","1970":"","1971":"To assess public attitude, actual working commitment and the respective influence of demographic, psychological and sociological variables on voluntary help in psychiatry. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the results of a representative population survey in Switzerland. Public attitude is mostly positive, but the respective working commitment is small. Attitude depends on gender, psychological factors (social distance, stereotypes), and on attitude to community psychiatry. For the working commitment, clearly distinct predictors are found: age, emotions, participation, and perceived discrimination to the mentally ill. For both attitude and commitment, having a social profession and interest in mass media are predictors. Internationally compared, Switzerland has a positive attitude and a big commitment in lay helping in psychiatry. But attitude is different from actual commitment. Lay helpers' work must be limited to realizable tasks and they need professional recruitment, instruction, and supervision otherwise they tend to be over-burden. The unused potential of voluntary helpers has to be opened specifically, e.g. by involving mass media and opinion-makers. ","1972":"Evaluation of a brief school programme providing information about schizophrenia to high school students. It was investigated whether the programme changed the students' attitude towards this target group and whether information given by a patient affects the results. 114 high school students (6 school classes) took part in the programme: 57 students were informed by a psychiatrist and an afflicted person (group A), the other 57 were informed by a psychiatrist and a social worker (group B). The students' attitude towards schizophrenics was assessed using a vignette of a fictitious class-mate suffering from schizophrenia (according to DSM criteria) and by questionnaires assessing the students' emotional and cognitive reactions and their social distance towards the person described by the vignette. Only in group A (psychiatrist and afflicted) there was a significant improvement regarding the emotional reaction (reduction of fear, increase in positive emotions) and a significant decrease in social distance. Moreover, students no longer associated psychiatric illness with being \"crazy\". In group B (psychiatrist and social worker) these changes could not be observed. There was even a significant increase in describing patients with schizophrenia as dangerous. As high school students themselves consider their level of knowledge about psychiatric illness as low, information about this topic should be given more attention than is currently done (also from a preventive point of view). For such information to be effective and to affect students' attitudes positively, it appears necessary that students have the opportunity to get in contact with a person affected by psychiatric illness. For changing attitudes it is also essential how information is presented. ","1973":null,"1974":"Until now, the interest of stigma research in psychiatry has been predominantly focused on schizophrenia. The fact that individuals suffering from depression may also be exposed to stigmatization, on the other hand, has received little attention. Using the scales for the assessment of perceived stigma and stigma coping developed by Link et al., 39 patients who had received in-patient treatment for a depressive episode were questioned 4-7 months after their discharge from hospital. 45% of the respondents reported concrete instances of stigmatization. Respondents expected to find discrimination and devaluation on the part of their environment especially with regard to their changes on the labour market. The vast majority of those questioned was in favour of keeping the fact that one had experienced a mental illness or had received psychiatric treatment to themselves. Further, our results show a tendency to avoid situations which might imply an increased risk of stigmatization. While respondents considered it important to facilitate a better understanding of mental illness on the part of their closest friends and relatives, the idea of being actively involved in educating the lay public received comparatively little support. Although individuals suffering from depression may be confronted with less rejection or resentment than schizophrenic patients or patients with substance use disorder, this does not imply that they do not have to struggle with the problem of stigmatization.

The empirically collected single words and phrases were subject to systematic semantical, linguo-historical as well as etymological investigations, the results of which were then contrasted with selected psychiatric concepts of the 18th\/19th century. Most of the words found aim at the head or brain which are often compared with a mechanism and regarded as the actual starting point of the disease. Other terms refer to blows or other mechanical impressions as the cause of mental illnesses. There is another group of words depicting weakness or even total loss of mind. Some of the ideas expressed by the words or structures analysed coincide with concepts psychiatrists had in the past. Many of the words even had been terms in psychiatric theory before they became part of the everyday language after having been loaded with negative connotative meanings making them inappropriate for being a scientific term. Some lexemes have been taken over from other languages, above all from English. Language mirrors stigmatisation of mentally ill people by society in an extraordinarily drastic way. Thus the colloquial names for them share the same fate as the words for other--ethnic, sexual, whatsoever--minorities: by pure means of language those people are regarded as somewhat strange, not belonging, something negative one does not wish to have contact with. On the other hand however, there have always been attempts to counter this by replacing negatively connotated words by other, neutral or even positive ones. Thus was the introduction of the new word nervenkrank (\"ill in the nerves\", cf English brainsick) in the 19th century, making mentally ill people even to bodily ill ones, what meant an enormous enhancement in value for both the patients and the psychiatrists. Today's name Betroffene (\"affect-ed\") is another example for those attempts. As can be seen from the historical retrospective this had been the case in former times as well. ","1977":"WHO and WPA recently inaugurated worldwide \"anti-stigma-campaigns\". On this background the exploration discrimination of against the mentally ill of the term stigma and its meaning is useful. Stigma dates from ancient Greece and was meant to be a visible sign of disgrace. Today stigma and stigma management are sociological terms described by the American sociologist Ervin Goffman (1963) in is essay \"Stigma--notes on the management to spoiled identity\". Changes and hazards of attempts of destigmatization are explored.","1978":"","1979":"","1980":"The growing number of ICD patients diagnosed with malignant arrhythmias are often exposed to severe psychosocial stressors. In a number of cases, these stressors could lead to anxiety and depression. Although emotional stressors may be a major contributing factor in malignant arrhythmia, it is unfortunate that these symptoms are largely ignored. Therefore, additional psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment services for the prevention of sudden cardiac death seem advisable in certain cases.","1981":"We introduce a case of a 66 year-old male with chronic alcoholism who suffered from confusion, Wernicke-aphasia and epileptic seizures. Several EEG revealed periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges. The patient's case resembles the symptoms of a subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures which can occur in alcoholics.","1982":"Lithium is used with great success in the treatment of manic patients and for prophylaxis of bipolar disorders. There are only few reports about neuropsychiatric side effects at therapeutic serum levels. We report on a 38 year old woman with bipolar disorder who was treated with lithium for 20 years without side-effects. Subsequent to a manic episode, she became disoriented at night and showed marked memory deficits. The patient did not show any neurological or gastrointestinal signs of intoxication. Lithium serum-levels were in therapeutic range. The psychiatric symptoms disappeared when lithium was stopped. We interpret these symptoms as delirant syndrome with pseudo-dementia at therapeutic lithium serum levels. This side-effect must be taken into account even in patients on successful longtime lithium therapy.","1983":"The importance of cognitive deficits concerning schizophrenics is well-known. Much less material of that kind has been collected from patients with affective disorders, which was the aim of this clinical study. Inclusion criterions were in- and outpatients with affective disorders (ICD-10: F31-F33) aged &lt; 61. The clinical status was determined by use of the HAMD-21, the subjects were examined by means of standardised computerised cognitive performance tests (CGT-[M], DAUF). The results were correlated with the HAMD and the psychiatric pharmacotherapy. In each of the three subtests the heavily depressive group (HAMD &gt; 24, n = 14) came off significantly (Mann-Whitney-U-Test, p &lt; 0.05) worse than the remitted group (HAMD &lt; or = 8, n = 18) while 8 of the 18 remitted patients showed pathological results in the CGT-(M). Only patients who took tranquilizers performed significantly worse than patients without such medication (p &lt; 0.05). In some cases of affective disorders, a \"cognitive residual syndrome\" persists which is rather part of the disease than pharmacotherapy-associated. ","1984":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the knowledge of medical students in psychiatric emergencies. Medical students were questioned concerning their knowledge about psychiatric emergencies, shortly before finishing their theoretical part of the medical training program. Findings indicated that medical students have significant deficits in psychiatric knowledge. Nevertheless, most students reported to be interested in psychiatry and to acknowledge the importance of psychiatric knowledge for general practioners. The reasons for the reported deficits cannot be sufficiently explained by a lack of interest in psychiatry or a negation of the importance of knowledge in psychiatry for general practioners and may hint to conceptual problems in the organisation of the medical training programs. ","1985":"Due to media reports and psychiatric literature coercive measures (seclusion, restraint, forced medication) seem to be carried out rather arbitrarily in psychiatric hospitals. We examined whether associations between severity of psychopathological symptoms, patients' aggressive behaviour and coercive measures would be found. 193 consecutive treatment episodes of our department for general psychiatry were examined. The psychopathological status at admission was recorded with the PANSS, aggressive behaviour during in-patient treatment with the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS). For each treatment episode we recorded whether coercive measures were carried out or not. Coercive measures were carried out in 47 patients (24.3%). MOAS scores in these patients were six fold higher than in patients who were not exposed to coercive measures. 56% of coercive measures occurred in the quarter of patients with the highest psychopathology, none in the quarter with the lowest psychopathology (p &lt; 0.0001). Contrary to frequent presumptions, the application of coercive measures in psychiatric hospitals is predominantly indicated by patients' psychopathology and violent behaviour.

Suprisingly, results from the last years in the nineties show different courses of suicide rates in psychiatric hospitals, sometimes with a tendency of a decrease.","1987":"Describe treatment motivation in offenders with addiction problems, who enter treatment in forensic hospital departments according to section 64 of the German penal code. Consider relevance of treatment motivation with regard to course and outcome of treatment. 83 patients were interviewed within the first days of psychiatric detention and after six month of treatment. They also filled in questionnaires on treatment motivation. Hospital staff reported another six month later about course of treatment. Most patients express awareness of drug\/alcohol related problems and an intention to participate in treatment. But only a minority of patients shows a very strong motivation to stay abstinent from alcohol\/drugs. More than half of the patients relapse during the first year of treatment. In more than one third of the cases, psychiatric detentions are cancelled due to a negative assessment of prognosis of further treatment. Most of these patients are returned to prison. Initial treatment motivation shows some relevance with regard to course of treatment. But negative outcomes of treatment shouldn't be explained simply as effects of insufficient motivation. A conception of treatment fostering hope and social competence seems to be most effective in strengthening treatment motivation.

Mentally impaired patients were significantly overrepresented in the violent group. Physical violence was reported in 25.8% (= 16.48 assaults\/100 patients\/year). 68% of the total amount of physical violence was directed against fellow patients. Violent behaviour was less driven by psychotic symptoms but rather by current everyday conflicts and stress situations. The majority of incidents had only minor consequences. Yet, an inquiry concerning the offenders' intentions and the danger experienced by staff members indicated a reasonable violent potential also in minor assaults which appears to be important with respect to ward climate and distress of staff.

Critical aspects of deinstitutionalization are discussed from the point of view of an office-based Nervenarzt (neurologist and psychiatrist). The limitations of office-based practice in providing care for the severely mentally ill (SMI) are described, i.e. lack of a multidisciplinary community mental health team, community psychiatric nursing and social work back-up in particular. Residential service and nursing homes are often under-staffed and ill-prepared for caring for people with SMI. A second view-point describes the Verbund Gemeindenahe Psychiatrie, a community psychiatric service for the just under 500,000 population of Leipzig in seven community mental health centers each combining day hospital, out-patient clinics and multidisciplinary community psychiatric care. This service is unique in Saxony and well accepted by service users and professionals.","1991":"The article shows the development of the long-stay departments at the psychiatric hospitals in Eastern Germany from the perspective of a local government. Against the apparently increasing scepticism of concepts of de-institutionalisation, the example of the city Leipzig is used to show how the process of reintegrating residents of long-stay institutions can be supported, and how decentralized out-patient psychosocial services--which can also be used by the community inhabitants--can be built up at the same time. Reference is also made to the well-developed out-patient services and clearly structured treatment offers for the inpatient sector which have already existed in the city before the political changes in Eastern Germany. Further, the role of the local Social Welfare Office in the realization of de-institutionalisation projects will be outlined.","1992":"Following a historic introduction the development of the chronics' departments of the big psychiatric hospitals in Saxony since 1990 is described: the goal of ending the care of the chronic mentally ill younger than 65 years in these departments, the newly restructured care of the mentally ill in Saxony and the problems attached to these processes.","1993":"A fundamental policy discussion of the scope and purpose of care for the mentally ill is presented along with practical examples. The second part describes the development of psychiatric care in the Free State of Saxony since 1990. Finally, the author outlines future developments.","1994":"The special position of psychiatry among the various medical disciplines is determined not least by the phenomenon of violent behaviour of some of its patients and the possibility of coercive measures against patients. The worldwide process of deinstitutionalization since the last decades is characterized by a substantial reduction of inpatient treatment and the expansion and improvement of increasingly specialized community care offers. Yet, at the same time paradoxically we are confronted with an increasing neglect of the special care requirements of a certain group of difficult-to-place patients (mostly severely chronically ill with high rates of comorbidity). Despite different social and legal conditions this has uniformly led to an increasing shift of these patients into the forensic system which is illustrated by a comparison of international and Austrian data. Forensic psychiatry is hardly able to cope with this development because of structural and personal deficits existing and is in danger of being misused primarily as an instrument of social control. From the position of forensic psychiatry the limits of deinstitutionalization are set by the feeling of responsibility of general psychiatry for a subgroup of troublesome and difficult to treat patients.","1995":"Psychiatric reform and the current system of mental health care in England are outlined, the system context of the National Health Service (NHS) is described. Recent institutional change in the NHS has introduced internal market elements. More than 90 mental hospitals have been closed. The TAPS study, a longitudinal study evaluating mental hospital closure is described. Results show a range of advantages of the post-discharge care arrangements. Studies evaluating services with a home treatment and community focus (DLP, PRiSM) suggest that community mental health care is feasible. Shortages and problems of the current system of care (acute beds, intensive residential and rehabilitation services) are outlined.","1996":"After a hopeful beginning, the social process of the reintegration of those with severe mental illness has come to a standstill. I am led to wonder whether \"the community\" really wants to live together with people suffering from severe mental illness, and if so, how closely? As long as the medical treatment of mental illness provided by the general practitioners is fundamentally deficient, as they are not able to prescribe the necessary interventions--such as out-patient psychiatric nursing, and service providers in the out-patient sector are content with offering increasingly intensive forms of care for the less seriously ill at the cost of the Social Welfare System--the reintegration of those with serious mental illness remains an illusion--which is mainly to the benefit of providers of residential care in homes and hostels.","1997":"The reform of psychiatric services started in Germany in 1975 with the publication of the governmental \"Enquete\"-Report. In the area of housing for chronic patients the recommendations made 1975 have not been fulfilled. A greater number of chronic patients as planned live in institutionalised homes with little access to the community and shortcomings in the area of individual self determination. The process of deinstitutionalization of the old chronic patients from psychiatric hospitals has created new problems. Some 60,000 patients have been deinstitutionalized, but in some parts of the country to a considerable degree just by renaming parts of the hospital into a home for the disabled. There is a need for research on who lives where and how and efforts have to be made to change this situation by the development of more community centered and individualised forms of living as shown by many successfully working regions in the country.","1998":"Deinstitutionalization is a complex process that in the past was often misunderstood solely as a run down or even closure of psychiatric hospitals. Although chronically mentally ill patients were prevented from long term hospitalisation some fundamental mistakes were repeated often: patients were simply discharged without any preparations and outpatient care was badly organised. In some cases this led to therapeutic neglect, social disintegration, homelessness, incarceration or other forms of dramatic loss of quality of life. These findings are internationally confirmed although there are remarkable differences between various health care systems. Especially when primarily determined by purely economic interests deinstitutionalization constitutes a severe danger for the whole psychiatric system of care and in particular for chronic patients. Intensive research is required to avoid severe disadvantages for the further development of psychiatry.","1999":"In 1998, the 1876 founded \"preussische Provinzialirrenanstalt\", a large asylum in Merzig (Germany), was closed down. Instead several psychiatric departments were founded in the rural county (\"Bundesland\"). On the asylum's former area in Merzig a new and modern general hospital including a psychiatric department was established. The present article will show up the former psychiatric hospital's genuine working fields, treating violent, self-harming and mental ill people needing help. It will describe in a differentiating way how the new services for the different groups of mental ill persons run: Decentralized general psychiatric care in defined regional areas (without forensic patients), central treatment for the forensic patients, regional care for people with mental retardation. In completion of this network there exist regional solutions for the themes \"living in a own home\", \"Working and occupation\" and \"day-structuring\". In conclusion, deinstitutionalization will not have any limits, despite of a few exceptions, if the limits of institutional thinking can be overcome.","2000":"The planning of health care is primarily an administrative task. Service research supports the health administration in this task by supplying empirical data to objectify the need for care and ways to cater for that need. In this, service research on the one hand draws on descriptive and analytical data of epidemiological studies. On the other hand, indices of social structure provide information about factors influencing the utilisation of health services. Apart from this, different types of service utilisation data are used for the analysis of needs. None of the methods mentioned is sufficient on its own. Only the integration of the different levels of analysis allows sufficiently competent statements on health care needs.","2001":"The article summarizes in an international perspective what kind of results psychiatric deinstitutionalization has brought so far: a profound change of size and functions of the psychiatric hospital; better services for people with less severe problems; and the failing of community services to compensate for some of the functions of the former asylums, resulting in trans-institutionalization and\/or neglect for many chronic patients. Three different sociological versions to explain the background and typical outcomes of psychiatric deinstitutionalization have been brought forward so far: political economy, professional dominance and post-structuralism. They are confronted with an approach using the concept of medicalisation which offers a more comprehensive understanding of the process.","2002":"","2003":"","2004":"","2005":"This paper describes a patient suffering from agoraphobia with panic disorder and with a history of self-induced epileptic seizures. The anxiety syndrome causing the admission to hospital could be diagnosed as non epileptic. He was treated successfully with a behaviour therapy. We discuss the possible interactions between anxiety disorders and epileptic seizures and some diagnostic demarcations. We conclude that even people with mild forms of epilepsy may develop an anxiety disorder arising from the fear of again getting epileptic seizures.

In both groups the willingness to participate in dementia research is high. Research without approval of patients or relatives is rejected in most cases. Relatives want to decide to which extent genetic results are used for scientific or personal purposes. Although research with (and for) demented patients is restricted by the law in many countries to certain limits, relatives are willing to participate in these efforts to a greater extend than expected. As long as the responsible physicians will respect their demented patients as severely ill human beings, the view towards research is this field might be as positive as shown in this sample. ","2007":"The effects of modification of documentation on the administration of psychotropic medication to involuntary patients in hospital were investigated. The charts of 414 inpatients on the acute-ward were reviewed two months before and two months after a new form for documentation of rationales for medication administration to involuntary patients was instituted. A follow-up was carried out for a two-month period a year later. The percentage of patients who received medication involuntarily, 70% of whom were schizophrenic, fell by over half, from 12% to 5%, after additional standardized documentation for the use of such medications was instituted. The number of medications administered to involuntary patients fell from 80 to 21, a reduction of 74%. The effects were stable over the course of one year. Modification of documentation seems to reduce the use of medication with involuntary patients. ","2008":"Hospital discharge letters represent important means of communication between clinicians and physicians in private practice. They greatly contribute to continuous patient management. A survey of the literature is carried out to provide a basis for an optimal psychiatric discharge letter. Deficiencies in quality of discharge summaries have been mentioned in many studies. These mainly concern delay and length of the letters. Well-structured form letters are preferred. Diagnosis, results of investigations, medication, and treatment after discharge are considered the most important details in the letter. Summarizing the results, the requirements for an optimal psychiatric discharge letter should be implemented in clinical practice to improve the record and also consumer satisfaction. Computer-generated discharge summaries can improve speed of delivery by using a standardized documentation system in psychiatry and new information technology. ","2009":"Video technology has been in use in the psychiatric field for more than 20 years for diagnostic, scientific, co-therapeutic or educational purposes. However, little is known of its potential applications and impact as an instrument in psychotherapy or environmental therapy. For this reason a new cinematographic project applying widespread video technology in environmental therapy, too, has been launched. All patients at our psychiatric hospital are involved in film selection, can cooperate at different organizational levels, and have regular opportunities to see films. The technical, the organizational and, in particular, the legal preconditions are set out, followed by a report on experience gained in use of video films within the setting of a psychiatric hospital. Reference is also made to economic aspects, therapeutic effects and contraindications.","2010":"This study describes patient evaluations about treatment interventions and the subjective value of specific treatment expectations. A random sample of 425 out-patients and in-patients was assessed to evaluate importance of treatment interventions and specific expectations of psychiatric treatment. Preferences regarding treatment interventions varied among diagnostic groups. Psychiatric patients ranked medication and supporting therapeutic conversations the highest. Sociodemographic characteristics, numbers of previous hospitalizations, quality of life and social abilities influenced treatment expectations. A patient's perception of dissatisfying quality of life and high social vulnerability increased the need for social assistance. Subjective treatment expectations of psychiatric patients should be the start-out for every treatment-regime. Socially vulnerable patients should be identified and specific treatment plans should be developed at treatment-start. ","2011":"During the last eight years we arranged an extensive process of change in Eckardtsheim, a part of Bethel in the city of Bielefeld. As part of the process of deinstitutionalization we tried to change institutional needs into the needs for help and support of the individuals. One important part of this process was working with family members of our clients in a variety of intervention strategies. We evaluated the relatives within the concept of customer orientation in different viewpoints. All family members got a mailed questionnaire (n = 1,068) in which they were questioned on their expectations and satisfaction with the most important aspects concerning the cooperation between family members and the treatment of the patients. We implemented support programs for the family members and asked them to judge these programs and the general process of change in the institution. 42% answered, mostly brothers and sisters. We received general support for our programs with a lot of individual criticism to certain parts of the process. Brothers and sisters were sceptical about deinstitutionalization of patients who had been institutionalized for decades. Working with families in these situations demands different ways of intervention, like information about the hospitalized family members and about the institutional change process as well as individualized support for the family members themselves. Services for the family members of long term hospitalized patients are extremely important and necessary for a positive outcome in the process of deinstitutionalization.","2012":"In 1939, Robert Faris and Warren Dunham published their pioneering work on \"Mental disorders in urban areas\". They investigated the distribution of mental disorders in Chicago. In the following decades, a number of studies using a similar design were carried out in various cities in the United States and in Europe, which largely replicated Faris' and Dunham's findings. The concentration of most psychiatric disorders in certain problem areas indicates the existence of a relationship between their distribution and unfavorable social conditions. However, the intention of ecological studies to find strong evidence for the psycho-social cause of mental disorders, especially of schizophrenia, failed. In schizophrenia, social selection leading to a particular spatial distribution of schizophrenic patients as a consequence of their illness or premorbid condition seems to be the most important factor. Rather than making a substantial contribution to the search for the causes of mental disorders as has been assumed up to now, identifying high risk areas of psychiatric disorders may serve as a rational basis for service planning and the allocation of resources.","2013":"","2014":"The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was one of the most famous patients in the psychiatric hospital Jena.

Psychiatric and general medical journals were systematically searched for articles on aims and objectives of mental health care. All three approaches promoted stronger community based care. None of them suggested an \"empowerment\" as it is understood today. Differences between them concerned equal care for mentally and physically ill patients, international relations, and economic arguments. Comparisons on other criteria, e.g. the relationship with university psychiatry, yield a less clear picture. All three ideas for reforms have been successful--to a limited and different extent.

Kahlbaum was also the first to differentiate between centripetal, intracentral and centrifugal psychic functions, which was later transformed into the \"psychic reflex circuit\" by Wernicke. The concept of organic versus non-organic psychoses proved to be a heuristically fruitful classification system even for modern psychiatry. Kahlbaum was the first German psychiatrist to describe several disorders and syndromes and to coin new psychiatric terminology for them, including paraphrenia, hebephrenia, catatonia and cyclothymia. These terms and their originally associated meaning are still in use today. Kahlbaum's ambitious scientific aim was to develop specific therapeutic strategies which were based on a methodologically and etiologically sound classification system.","2021":"This paper emphasizes the long lines of tradition biological concepts have in the explanation of mental disorders in classical antiquity and the middle ages; yet it also portrays rivalling theories. I describe both medical and philosophical approaches, as they merged into a quite coherent model during scholasticism. The work of Albert the Great serves as an example for this model.

Furthermore, a module of questionnaires and instruments for assessing outcome variables (e.g. quality of life) is integrated. The principles for using the paper-pencil-version and the EDP-version are outlined and discussed with regard to the legal regulations concerning the protection of personal data.

In a five-year follow-up study in Hamburg among 350 opiate dependents who, at the time of the initial survey, were in contact with the drug help system, 219 clients (63%) could be interviewed at (so far) three different times of investigation. Standardised questionnaires like the EuropASI, CIDI, SCL-90-R, STAI and BDI were used for the interviews. The general life situation of the surveyed persons has on the whole improved in the course of the last two to three years. Also the average drug consumption clearly decreased. Between mental disorders\/disturbances and drug dependence or drug-related problems, a linear correlation could be found: An unfavourable course of mental disorders and symptoms correlates with a problematic current life situation of the client. There is also a global relationship between increased drug consumption and the emergence of mental symptoms like depressiveness and anxiety and the psychosocial functional level. The expected relationship between mental disturbances and the extent of drug consumption is not very marked. This is in support of the basic assumption that specific constellations of drug consumption and mental disorders do not exist isolated, but that they are related, as elements of a complex pattern, to the development of other areas of life.

Studies from the USA analyze the difference between culturally dependent dysphoric affect and clinical depressivity among Iranians. Goal of this study was to discuss specific aspects of migration for depression among Iranians. 94 Iranian migrants were interviewed in different settings. Half of them met criteria for a depressive disorder, which correlated well with the depression scales BDI and HAMD. Depressives showed higher acculturation problems, immigration stress and social isolation than non-depressives. Therapy for depressive Iranian migrants should focus more strongly on barriers of acculturation than on cultural differences in psychopathology.","2030":"With the background of a number of meta-analyses on the optimal neuroleptic dosages [1,2] the average daily dosage for the treatment of acute schizophrenic episodes recommended in the internal treatment guidelines of our psychiatric clinic was reduced from 24 mg to 15 mg haloperidol equivalent. In the present retrospective study it was investigated what effect this change in guideline had on the actual dosing behavior and on the efficacy and the side effect rate of the antipsychotic treatment. For this purpose all haloperidol treated patients of a two year interval prior to the change of the guideline (1987\/88, n = 103) were compared with all treated of a two year interval (1991\/92, n = 87) following it. The evaluation of the treatment data showed that the dosing guideline was adhered to and in 1991\/92 on the average actually only 15 mg haloperidol were prescribed daily in acute schizophrenic episodes. The antipsychotic efficacy was just as good under this dosage as under the average daily dose of 24 mg haloperidol given in the preceeding interval; the average time in hospital was even reduced from 76 to 67 days. Under the lower daily doses an additional medication with biperiden was less often required. Average daily doses of 15 mg haloperidol appear to be at least equally as effective and more tolerable for the treatment of acute schizophrenic episodes than average daily doses of 24 mg haloperidol.

A survey, using open-ended questions, was carried out among schizophrenic patients from all over Germany (n = 565). Most frequently the patients hoped for a general improvement or stabilisation of their state of health when taking medication. When asked about positive effects, almost every fourth respondent gave a somewhat paradoxical answer by stating that the medication should have less or no side effects. Less frequently, by only 15%, the calming and relaxing effect of the drugs was cited, followed by the antipsychotic effect and relapse prevention. With regard to negative effects, extrapyramidal motor symptoms ranked first with 42% of those questioned regarding them to be a restriction of their quality of life which should definitely be avoided.

New results indicate that the advantages of breast feeding can outweight the given risks of maternal pharmacotherapy, if minimal necessary drug-doses of an agent with a small amount of passage into milk are prescribed.

Eighty patients who lived in these group homes on the first key day, June 30th 1993, were investigated. Any change in their living situation and rate of hospitalization was ascertained at follow-up, 3.5 years after the first key day. The patients had an average period of hospitalization of 240.5 days per year before entry to a group home, which decreased to 12.4 days per year after entry to a sheltered group home. At follow-up more than half of all patients (65%) were still able to live in the community successfully. The number and the length of hospitalizations between the first key day and the follow-up were lowest for patients who had moved to private homes. Sheltered group homes play an essential role in the process of rehabilitation towards independent living within the community.

The median of hospitalisation was 26 days with no significant differences between the two groups. At discharge outpatient treatment was planned for only 16% of the homeless patients but for 40% of the controls. There was a significant improvement in symptoms and self reported state of health. On admission and discharge thought disturbance and a positive self-rating of mental health were significantly correlated. Against the wide-spread clinical prejudice that inpatient treatment of homeless mentally ill men is not effective our results show that the objective state of health as well as the self-perceived mental and physical health was improved by a regular psychiatric in-patient treatment.

There was a higher rate of involuntary admission in the homeless group, less contact to mental health services in the weeks before admission, more psychopathological symptoms and more physical neglection. Self-rating of mental and physical health, however, did not differ significantly. There was a positive correlation between thought disturbance and positive self-rating of mental health.

Up to now only a few data concerning this topic are available. 255 psychiatric inpatients were given a short questionnaire about their illness, its course, and the wish for being informed about their psychiatric diagnosis and the prognosis of their psychiatric disorder. Most patients want to get informations about their diagnosis (88.6%) and the prognosis of their psychiatric disorder (80.4%). Only 27.8% of the patients described a fear of the disclosure of diagnosis, and some more (35.3%) were afraid to hear the prognosis of their psychiatric disorder. However, this fear did not reduce their wish to become fully informed. 60% of the patients reported a satisfactory information of their diagnosis and were able to give the correct medical diagnosis.

While psychiatric hospitals are routinely permitted to establish outpatient clinics, psychiatric departments of general hospitals, even if they serve a catchment area, need a formal permission of the organisation of the physicians in private practice. The law requires proof for some kind of \"demand\". In the catchment area of a recently founded psychiatric department of a rural general hospital, 44% of 131 medical practitioners answered a written questionnaire. Psychiatrists and psychologists objected to any kind of outpatient clinic, as expected. All the general practitioners and specialists, however, supported the idea.

Our comprehensive treatment program includes psychoeducation for patients and relatives, cognitive training, social skills training, additional psychoeducation for patients with dual diagnosis and a variety of a traditional group therapies like work therapy. An intensive cooperation is practised with complementary psycho-social services. In n = 89 consecutive admissions lasting at least 2 weeks we examined which patients were reached by these treatment offers. 84% of the patients participated in group therapies, where they passed 6.9 hours weekly on average. Most patients were reached by occupation therapy (62%), followed by physical therapy (54%), unspecific conversation group (54%), psychoeducation (35%), cognitive training (30%), work therapy (26%) and social skills training (7%). The PANSS Positive Scale at admission was negatively correlated with participation in group therapies. The implementation of a variety of psychotherapeutic offers for psychotic patients adequate to the state of the art can be achieved under conditions of standard hospital care in Germany (Psych-PV-law).

Within the scope of a major study on vocational rehabilitation in the German region of Westphalia-Lippe, we carried out a prospective study of the further vocational course of 61 patients who had already been placed in competitive employment within the framework of the Consultancy Centres. These patients (30 men, 31 women) had a mean age of 31 years (+\/- 6.9); 54% of them were suffering from schizophrenic disorders; mean duration of illness was 8.2 years (+\/- 6.8). After two years (and for a subsample of 33 patients also after 3 years) two-thirds of patients were still in competitive employment. Predictors of success proved to be 1) a higher ability to cope with vocational stress on introduction of the measure, 2) an earlier start to rehabilitation, and 3) financial assistance for the company. A close correlation was recorded between course of illness (rehospitalizations) and success of rehabilitation. Even in the current situation of high unemployment rates vocational integration of mentally ill patients is possible and stable in medium term. Especially highly-motivated patients with favourable preconditions (early start of rehabilitation measures, higher ability to cope with work stress) are successful if intensive long-term support--including efforts involving employers--is provided.

To date, vocational integration programs enable only a small number of persons with psychiatric disabilities to attain reintegration into competitive employment. The predictors of successful vocational integration are subsequently discussed. A substantial increase in both sheltered and competitive jobs on the common labour market could be achieved for mentally ill and disabled people by adapting the \"supported employment\" model, as widely practised in the USA, to European labour market standards and appropriately funding its implementation. The utilisation of this model could serve to reduce the necessity of further expansion in the special labour market.","2075":"","2076":"","2077":"It is difficult to define intracranial sinus thrombosis by clinical symptoms only.

The articles identified are analyzed formally quantatively and qualitatively. The ten annual volumes analyzed contained 45 articles in which tranquilizers were mentioned (4.5 per annual volume). The key words were found in all sections of the papers, most often, however, in the cultural section, followed by the science section. Regarding the themes medicine and law were in the first position (one third), but society, arts and culture and politics contained even more articles dealing with the key word minor tranquilizer.

In addition to expected effects (improvement or stabilisation of one's state of mental health, antipsychotic effects), patients surprisingly often highlighted clozapine's calming and relaxing effect as well as improved sleep as particularly positive. While more than half of the respondents expected a worsening of their condition in case they stopped taking their medication, only every fifth patient feared a relapse. Among the negative effects, fatigue and sedation were cited by far the most often. The absence of extrapyramidal side effects was clearly noted as an advantage of clozapine. Only every tenth of those questioned was aware of the risks for the haemotopoietic system associated with the drug.

In addition to the positive effects on the schizophrenic illness, relatives strikingly often pointed out the calming, sleep-improving effect of clozapine. As opposed to the patients, the majority of relatives were well aware of the risks associated with discontinuing the drug treatment. Both patients and relatives complained about the sedative effect and the increased need for sleep associated with clozapine treatment. However, diverging evaluations were given with regard to hypersalivation, anticholinergic effects, and weight gain. Relatives were more concerned about possible organ damage occurring as a long-term effect than the patients. Further, indications were found that relatives were more worried by the risk of haematotoxic effects resulting from clozapine treatment than the patients. It could be said that, among the relatives, there was a slightly greater awareness of the advantages of clozapine treatment in comparison with conventional neuroleptics than there was with the patients. The importance of relatives' views in the effort to secure adequate neuroleptic treatment despite the current economic restrictions should not be under-estimated.

They are seen close to violence and restriction, as punishment or even as torture, as paralyzing or even as \"torturetherapy\". Informations in the articles are scarce. Most of the articles cover the fields of medicine or psychiatry or of forensics. Apart from the negative attitude the extremely low number of articles on neuroleptics is the most outstanding result of our study. ","2084":"The present study is based on the assumption that for patients' compliance with psychotropic medication is also of importance their closest relatives' attitude towards that treatment. In the context of a mail survey of relatives of people with schizophrenia, we asked what the relatives considered to be the most important positive and negative effects of the medication. As expected, the main benefit was seen in the reduction of symptoms and in the prevention of relapse. In addition, the improvement of social adaptation and the subjective quality of life of the patients were also cited as important positive effects. Beside these effects which are closely related to the treatment of the disorder, respondents mentioned effects which can help to facilitate their living together with their ill relative. Among the side effects regarded as particularly unpleasant for the patients, sedation ranked first, followed by weight gain and extra-pyramidal motor symptoms. The results are contrasted with those of a comparable study of people with schizophrenia. ","2085":"The aim of this study was to develop a questionnaire for measuring depressed patients' knowledge of their disease. 55 patients suffering from depressive episodes answered a 77-items questionnaire. Item analysis showed a discriminative power higher than 30 for 40 items, all of which applied to one factor. The items were arranged into two thematically similar 20 items forms. We added four additional items (discriminative power between 0.20 and 0.29) because future research may lead to different results concerning discriminative power. The questionnaires DEWIPA-A and DEWIPA-B consists of 24 items each. The average difficulty is equal for both DEWIPA forms and they both possess significant discriminative power. Our results support the hypothesis that DEWIPA is a valid and reliable instrument to determine patients' knowledge of symptoms, causes and the psychopharmacological treatment of depression. ","2086":"93 general practitioners participating in a WHO field trial testing the ICD-10-primary health care classification system in German-speaking countries completed a questionnaire dealing with their practice of diagnosis and treatment of patients with depressive disorders. There was a great variety of diagnoses that were often vague. Counselling tended to be \"good advice\" instead of specific intervention. Antidepressant medication mostly consisted of tricyclic antidepressants in rather low dosages. Only few of the general practitioners informed patients thoroughly about side-effects and risks of antidepressant medication.","2087":"The name of Eugen Bleuler is usually known in the context of the definition and conceptualization of schizophrenic disorders. Main other topics, less known in literature, are alcoholism, forensic psychiatry and general psychological topics of meaning of consclousness, formation of motive and will. Bleulers point of view presents itself as an empirically-based and anti-philosophic one, definitely deterministic concerning the topic of human \"freedom of will\". Eugen Bleuler refers to an already (especially by Richard Semon) systematically developed theory called \"mnemism\" that he interpreted and applied to the psychological circumstances mentioned above. That theory of \"mnemism\", that can be most adequately described as a biogenetic-vitalistic theory, is assuming, that all organic life--independent of the possibility of a self-reflecting consciousness--is able to learn experiences made by analysis of environment and to pass it on following generations. Pattern of stimulus reactions are in the sense of this theory memorized and reactivated under similar situational circumstances by the psychological mode of association. The influence of psychoanalytical theories, especially the presumed importance of infantil sexuality, on Bleulers understanding of a medical psychology seems to fade over the years.","2088":"","2089":"","2090":"","2091":"A case of a psychosis induced by ingestion of blossoms of the solanum Brugmansia insigniis is presented. This plant is used by young persons as a hallucinogenic drug. The psychopathology of this kind of intoxication has not been documented in the literature up to now. It is characterized by anticholinergic effects (e.g. mydriasis), disturbances of orientation, incoherent thoughts, flight of ideas, tangential thinking illusions, auditory hallucinations (e.g. verbal hallucinations), visual hallucinations and affective lability. In addition to hyoscine (scopolamine) and atropine, hallucinogenic effects may be related to previously identified alkaloids.","2092":"Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenic patients whose symptoms do not respond to traditional antipsychotic drugs. The emergence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment of clozapine has been reported in some case studies. We report on the case of a 31-year old man with chronic schizophrenia who had shown obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment with clozapine. A 31-year old patient with treatment refractory schizophrenia was treated with clozapine. During clozapine treatment, positive symptomatology decreased, but after 4 months after starting clozapine the patient showed obsessive and compulsive symptoms. This symptomatology had previously not been a feature of this patient's illness. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were observed during treatment of clozapine in a schizophrenic patient. This may be explained either by the serotonin-receptor antagonism of clozapine or its atypical dopaminergic receptor effects. ","2093":"The aim of our study is to find out in which clinical and sociodemographic parameters patients who take part in kinetic therapy and those, who don't, differ. 38 patients of a psychiatric university clinic who regularly took part in movement therapy were compared with 32 patients who did not. The participants had a higher level of education, obtained fewer psychotropic drugs and were assessed as slightly less impaired by their disorder. Our findings cannot fully explain what determines participation in kinetic therapy. Other factors like the cut-off of five times for assignment, the therapist's influence and the theory of self-efficacy need to be discussed. ","2094":"The legal provisions concerning the admission to hospital, holding powers and compulsory treatment of mentally ill persons in Great Britain and Germany are compared and the underlying medicolegal conceptions analysed. Whereas British law gives key powers to multiprofessional decision making and relatives, German law requests formal court decisions even in routine issues. This reflects a different understanding of individual rights and their protection. The German mental health law is motivated by the experiences of the totalitarian National Socialist regime. It tries to protect the patient's rights by restricting physicians, hospitals and family members' influence. British law, on the other hand, assumes that experts as well as family members act benevolently in the patient's interest, prefers less formal mechanisms and expresses trust in professional ethics. Further research is necessary to analyse the situations in other countries and to investigate which of these approaches is the better one from the point of view of the mentally ill. This is even more important as in the long view European integration will touch these questions and will result in convergence of medicolegal issues. ","2095":"Evaluating the establishment of social psychiatry services (SPS) in Saxony was part of a public health research project. One of the variables in a specifically designed assessment instrument--used in 8 SPS during the period 08\/95-01\/97--was the retrospective statement concerning changes in the client's vocational situation caused by the social upheavals in 1989. 40.6% (n = 335) answered in the affirmative. Men are significantly overrepresented in the group with vocational changes; compared to the population without vocational changes the proportion of currently unemployed persons (56%) is five times higher; only 16% are still employed. Neurotic\/personality disorders as well as brief mental disturbances and dependency disorders are more frequent than in the whole SPS-clientele.--The most important constellation (19%) identified by a configuration-frequency analysis is that of patients with prolonged psychotic disorders (started &lt; 1990, not associated with dependency disorder) who were employed at sheltered workplaces during the GDR-period despite of their mental disorder. Following the political German reunification possibilities of vocational rehabilitation have deteriorated and up to now the number of newly established alternatives in regional mental health services is insufficient. ","2096":"Local care provision for the chronically mentally ill entails responsibility to be taken by all institutions involved in the care system of their respective area. In the clinical sphere regional responsibility is implement-ed to a large extent apart from a few university clinics. The University Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Clinic Tuebingen look after an area with obligatory provision of care consisting of 140,000 inhabitants in 1995. The comparative evaluation of the basic documentation showed minimal overall changes but an increase of older patients, of patients who are frequently hospitalised, and of addicts. The number of emergencies remained unchanged. The concomitant questioning of colleagues indicated delayed acceptance of the change. According to experiences made to date, the conditions for research and teaching have improved in certain areas thanks to the obligatory provision of care. ","2097":"Empirical studies of nursing in psychiatry rarely consider the collaboration between nurses and doctors. Which variables determine the quality of the cooperation between nurses and doctors? In 1992 and 1997, all nurses of a psychiatric hospital were interrogated by means of questionnaire (FAPP) in order to measure the quality of collaboration. In spite of major changes in the hospital management and higher work-load assessment by the nurses concerning the collaboration with doctors and with other nurses, the quality of team-work and participating in treatment decisions, was more positive in 1997. Nurses with a \"negative\" collaboration with doctors, also have difficulties to collaborate with other nurses. This finding did not depend on gender, age or length of professional career. All institutional provisions that improve the cooperation, the competence, the responsibility, and the ward-atmosphere, also ameliorate the cooperation with other occupational groups in the hospital. ","2098":"The present study examined quality of life of alcoholic women in detoxification. The study aimed at providing data in line with a so-called subject oriented evaluation and at finding ways for improving clinical care. 70 alcoholic women were asked about their quality of life and about their need for qualities help. A follow-up study, six months later, examined the extent of relapse. Alcoholic women differ in their subjective quality of life. Subgroups, which differ regarding the structure of quality of life, also vary in age, job situation and finances, age of admission and their view on their alcohol dependence. They differ in their needs, too. Subjective quality of life predicts relapse. The findings suggest that subjective quality of life may be useful evaluation criterion. The assessment of quality of life may yield useful hints for therapeutic interventions. ","2099":"The association of education and the risk of developing dementia are reviewed. Proposed underlying mechanisms are discussed with the particular reference to social aspects. The discussion is based on recent work published on the association of education and dementia risk dealing with incident cases. Strength and consistency of the association as well as the partly established dose response relationship indicate that higher education is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia. This had been explained as a consequence of a greater \"brain reserve capacity\", which might be constituted by different mechanisms in early periods of CNS-development and during adulthood. Education rather compensates neuro-degenerative changes than protects from dementia. Clinical signs of dementia will be delayed but not prevented. The knowledge about social aspects of this process implies the search for interventions. ","2100":"Emil Kraepelin's (1856-1926) famous lecture \"Zur Diagnose und Prognose der Dementia praecox\" was held in Heidelberg 100 years ago on 27. November 1889. In this lecture Kraepelin suggested for the first time his famous \"nosological dichotomy\" between the group of \"manisch-depressives Irresein\" and the so-called \"Dementia-praecox-Gruppe\". This dichotomy became world famous since the publication of his \"Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie\", 6th edition 1899. Kraepelin founded his psychiatric system on outcome observations and the nosological principles of Kahlbaum. His nosology is very influential to the present day. The revision of American psychiatry in the 1970's and 1980's is unthinkable without Kraepelin's concept. Therefore the name \"Neo-Kraepelinianism\" was created.","2101":"","2102":"","2103":"","2104":"","2105":"","2106":"Work therapy is a widespread form of socio-therapy. In contrast to pharmacological and somatic forms of treatment, proof of efficacy is difficult to produce in multimodal therapy of psychiatric patients. Within the framework of an extensive study on vocational rehabilitation of mentally ill patients, we carried out a naturalistic follow-up study of 112 mostly schizophrenic patients attending outpatient work therapy programmes. The courses of illness and rehabilitation were documented prospectively over a three-year period. At the end of the study 23% of the patients were integrated into the open labour market, 25% were working in sheltered employment, 25% remained in work therapy, and 27% were unemployed. Controlled studies with schizophrenic patients show, that work therapy contributes to improved vocational integration, a reduction of rehospitalizations and a stabilisation of the psychopathological status.","2107":"","2108":"","2109":"","2110":"","2111":"The development of community psychiatry needs an increasing network management between inpatient and outpatient care. As a whole the question of management structure is open for discussion. Instruments such as psychosocial workshops and community psychiatric team conferences are in need of a critical survey. Our paper offers data in basic network management referring to false connections in interinstitutional cooperation by phone. The number of false connections is on a highly significant level, up to six times higher when contacting ambulant complementary staffs or administrative levels than within medical systems. These results demonstrate a large gap between utopia and reality of network management. Community psychiatric systems must take care for longitudinal medical staff orientation in structural management.

The authors report on a forensic psychiatric case with a transsexual development after committing an offence based on sexual deviations. Transsexualism in this context seems to represent an attempt for the symbolic solution of a conflict of identity. This should be interpreted in the context of psychotherapy and not be misunderstood as a symptom proving the diagnosis of manifest transsexualism by orientation on pure phenomenological criteria.","2115":"We report on two schizophrenics with transsexual beliefs to illustrate the problems in nosological classification of these patients and the difficulties in preparing expertises on changing the first name or on the legal changing of sex status according to the German Transsexuals Act (TSG). We should differentiate between rare cases of true comorbidity of schizophrenia and transsexualism, and other patients in whom the transsexual wish presents as a symptom of psychosis. Before approving any legal changes or even sex reassignment surgery, the transsexual wish should have remained unchanged under otherwise successful antipsychotic treatment. Moreover, the patients must be able to translate into reality the desired sexual role in their social environment.","2116":"Characteristics of social networks and social support were investigated in a group of 35 imprisoned mentally ill sex offenders. We compared current parameters (after an average of 3 years of psychosocial therapy) with those at the time of the offence. Analyses reveal a decrease in social network size but an increase in social support by the remaining or new social network members. These changes are discussed in reference to various influencing variables in a therapeutic prison facility. The impact of psychosocial interventions in relapse prevention of sexual offenders will be outlined. ","2117":"Mental illness appears to be overrepresented among homeless individuals. The purpose of this study was the standardised assessment of mental illness in a representative sample of homeless men and of homeless women in the city of Munich, Germany. In order to get a very good estimate of the population of homeless individuals in Munich, a pre-sampling survey was conducted. On the basis of this pre-sampling survey the size and relevant characteristics of the total population of homeless individuals in Munich were defined. Individuals of the sample were randomly selected from the population. 146 men and 32 women were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS). Homeless men were on the average 43 years of age; most of them unmarried or divorced, had a relatively low degree of school education and a relatively long duration of homelessness. The prevalence of mental illness (lifetime) was very high: 91.8% had a substance abuse disorder (82.9% alcohol dependence), 41.8% had an affective disorder, 22.6% had an anxiety disorder and 12.4% suffered from schizophrenia. Of the homeless men in Munich 94.5% had at least one DIS\/DSM-III axis I diagnosis 6-month prevalence data is also presented. The results confirm the findings of other studies in other countries of high rates of mental illness among homeless individuals. In comparison to a study in Los Angeles using the same methodology, prevalence rates were even higher in Munich. Implications for health care planning are discussed. ","2118":"To assess the non-cognitive symptoms in 153 consecutive dementia patients admitted to our psychiatric ward or seen at the gerontopsychiatric ambulance and Memory Clinic. We used the Global Deterioration Scale, the Hachinski Ischaemia Score, the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression, and the Mini-Mental State Exam as staging tools in a cross-sectional design. A semi-quantitative 34-item questionnaire based on the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology was employed to assess non-cognitive symptoms as reported by caregivers. All patients had disturbances of affect, 95% of behavior and 71% of motivation, while 52% and 29% had delusions and hallucinations, respectively. Delusions, but not hallucinations, were correlated with verbal and physical aggressiveness. Factor analysis extracted three complex variables which accounted for 40.6 percent of the observed total variance, and which were subsequently interpreted as manifestations of agitation, burdensome behavior, and depression. Using these variables, we then identified three categories of patients: Agitated, debilitated, and depressive-anxious. Depression and anxiety were most common 3-4 years after diagnosis. Patients with Alzheimer's disease had less severe behavioral and psychotic symptoms than those with other types of dementia. Agitation, depression, and loss of competence in daily living had a greater impact on caregivers than aggression and psychotic symptoms. The non-cognitive symptom profile is related to the type of dementia, and shifts dynamically with disease progression. ","2119":"","2120":"In recent years numerous studies have been published on the quality of life of schizophrenic patients. However, the patients' understanding of what quality of life is about has not been given sufficient attention. 565 schizophrenic patients from the whole of Germany were asked what quality of life meant for them. Aspects of quality of life which can be subsumed under the heading of social integration were cited most frequently. As for the study as a whole, the most important aspect in this context was work and employment. Health represented a second domain. More specifically, respondents cited health in general (which was the second most frequently cited overall aspect) or health with respect to their mental illness in the sense of absence of symptoms and illness-related impairments. A third domain includes various components of well-being such \"joie de vivre\" or independence. Psychiatric treatment was associated with quality of life only as an exception, and if so only in negative terms. The results are contrasted with a comparable survey among psychiatrists.

After showing no favourable response to ECT, the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease was made and the patient was treated with L-dopa plus benserazide and pergolide in combination with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor moclobemide. Both depressed mood and motor symptoms showed dramatic improvement under this therapy.","2124":"Capgras syndrome is a delusional misidentification, a phenomenon where a person believes delusionally that another person (in most cases closely related) has been replaced by a double or impostor of identical appearance. It is usually a symptom of a functional psychosis but sometimes it is also associated with organic cerebral dysfunction. We present a case of a 23-year old women who had the delusional belief that her cat had been replaced by the cat of her former boy-friend. Reviewing the literature we found that such a case is very rare. The association between Capgras syndrome and depersonalisation-derealisation phenomena is also pointed out.","2125":"Ever so often one can read about the \"Werther effect\" in psychiatric literature. Until now this term has not lost its imaginative power, and still has its impact as well as being the subject of controversial discussion. In order to clarify the \"Werther effect\", it seemed first of all necessary to illuminate the real biographical background of Goethe's \"The sorrows of young Werther\" and the extraordinarily eventful history of its reception. This essay also cites comments on this novel made by various personalities and authorities in an attempt to provide some hints on the real impact that Goethe's novel had at its time and showing the quarrels it brought about. Here the author comes to the conclusion that considering the ideologies prevailing at that time (late enlightenment and sentimentalism) the dispute about Goethe's work only aims at hiding the actual discussion about the people's right of self-determination. ","2126":"The study focuses on biographic and social aspects including illness behaviour of psychiatric in-patients who committed suicide in weekend leave. The authors undertake a retrospective qualitative analysis of 14 cases of inpatient suicide. 11 of 14 patients had been confronted during their weekend leaves with a milieu full of emotional conflicts with their spouses, parents or children. These conflicts had been of considerable subjective significance for the patients, who often experienced feelings of guilt and failure in their relations. Weekend leave of psychiatric inpatients is to be considered as a risk factor for suicide, a risk that must be taken into account before sending a patient home for the weekend. ","2127":"To improve the community-based health care in the area of Bonn a telephone consulting service and a mobile crisis intervention service have been established during a two year pilot project. The regional needs and structural demands have been assessed. During the first 12 months the number of calls increased from 15 in November 1996 to 76 in October 1997. In all, 432 calls were received. Most calls lasted from 10 to 30 minutes. 89% of the callers were female, 77% were in the age range between 30 and 45 years. Two-thirds of the callers had prior psychiatric treatments. Most callers suffered from loneliness and deficient coping strategies. The prove regional demands have led to a continuation of the project and an extension of the mobile crisis intervention service. ","2128":"106 patients (64.2% male and 35.8% female) who applied for a withdrawal treatment by phone call, were interviewed concerning the admission context with the aim to find out whether the admission regulations prevent patients from undergoing treatment. 72.6% of all patients were admitted as inpatients. The average waiting period was 8 days. 15.1% were known to have previously suffered from conclusions and 4.7% from delirium tremens; for these patients, the waiting period was significantly shorter. High-threshold admission is not an insurmountable difficulty. Waiting periods and soberness at admission are accepted. Setting up admission conditions is, on the one hand, justified, whereas on the other hand chronic patients are often not reached. Telephone contacts with patients willing to undergo treatment should be replaced by contacts in an outpatient setting.

The questionnaires of a mail-survey covered features of 58 different non-hospital full-time institutional settings and care for a group of 125 long-term mental patients. The return rate was more than 70 percent. For 78 percent of the discharged former long-term inpatients the political goal of complete psychiatric care in the patient's home area has been reached, but only 20 percent live in smaller institutions of up to 40 places. The significance of other data of the survey does not exceed that of stock-taking and certain indications because of the selective data and the limitations of the method. There is an urgent need for further research in examining the quality of non-hospital institutional care for psychiatric long-term patients.

The patients' QOL was evaluated using the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile. Moreover psychopathology and extrapyramidal-motoric side-effects were assessed. Long-stay patients had a more distinct psychopathological symptomatology and more severe side-effects than community-based patients. After adjustment for psychopathology and side-effects, the subjective QOL of long-stay patients was significantly reduced in two out of eight life domains: housing and leisure activities. While psychopathology was negatively correlated with QOL, a subgroup with very marked psychopathology showed unexpectedly high QOL ratings. Results suggest that psychopathology is a stronger predictor of subjective QOL than side-effects and treatment setting. Patients with very distinct psychopathology probably use lower standards than others when evaluating their QOL which should be taken into consideration when analysing this type of data. ","2132":"In this study \"ideal\" psychiatric inpatient care from the patient's point of view was examined. Based upon a content analysis of 38 interviews a questionnaire containing 39 items was developed to evaluate attributes of ideal psychiatric inpatient care from the patient's viewpoint. 58 of 116 patients completed the questionnaire; the analysis group was representative for acute psychiatric inpatients. The patients ranked highly: successful treatment, upholding of human rights, privacy, empathic doctors, competent doctors, free exit, friendly staff. Factor analysis identified four factors that may be called Psychiatric Treatment, Patient Autonomy. Staff Competence, Appointment. The ratings were not associated with sociodemographic or disease-related variables. Therapists' ratings were mostly in agreement with those of the patients', but therapists underestimated the importance of the items free exit, patients' co-influence in treatment planning, respect among the patients. The aspect of patient autonomy was also rarely found in other professionals' questionnaires. Findings reflecting patients' expectations regarding \"ideal\" psychiatric inpatient care vary. Validity of former questionnaires is reduced if important aspects of patient satisfaction are disregarded.

Treatment with liquorphoresis and clonazepam or diazepam alone resulted in a prompt amelioration of the rigidity and, to a lesser extent, of the agoraphobia as well. The stiff-man syndrome has neurological and psychological aspects and shows one more facet of the syndrome of agoraphobia first described by Westphal.","2138":"In Germany, measures for assuring the quality of inpatient treatment are regulated by legislation. Treatment quality must be presented in comparison with other hospitals. Tracer diagnosis is an established method for external quality assurance in the sphere of somatic medicine. To evaluate this method of external quality assurance in psychiatry, the German Society for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Nervous Diseases (DGPPN) defined and operationalised quality indicators for the treatment of schizophrenic inpatients. of a multicentre project supported by the German Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) using this inventory in 96 schizophrenic inpatients (ICD-10) from 4 hospitals are presented. The qualification of these indicators of structure, process and outcome while comparing the treatment quality of different hospitals as well as their applicability for internal quality management are discussed. ","2139":"For the second time after 1990, a community mental health service questioned the outcome quality of its day hospital in rehabilitating primarily psychotic patients. In addition to the assessment of 66 persons at the beginning and at the end of an average of six months' treatment in the years 1990-95, a psychologist who had not been involved in the treatment interviewed 49 persons one year after discharge with the use of goal attainment scaling in five relevant fields. Due to the economic recession the goal attainment decreased with regard to the job situation in the sense that it was difficult to find unsheltered jobs. By defining the goals in accordance with the needs of the patients, an improvement in the lodging situation was observed. As a result of the first study, quality monitoring led to an improvement of the structures that promote spare time interests. Social contacts and coping with everyday life showed sustainable achievements. These achievements can be interpreted as a result of the comparably long time of exposure to social learning within the therapeutic milieu of the day hospital. This hypothesis of a positive correlation between the sustainability of the outcome and the length of treatment must be validated by another study. ","2140":"The German Social law requires quality assurance of inpatient treatment, i.e. of the quality of therapy, allowing the comparison of different hospitals. Since easy administrable assessment instruments are required, in this study (part of a greater survey on quality assurance at the Department of Psychiatry in Luebeck) a global self-rating by means of a visual analog scale (VAS) and the GAF (Global Assessment of Function) were compared with the ratings on the SCL-90-R scale in 386 psychiatric inpatients (mean age: 44.0 +\/- 15.2 years). The comparison of the values on admission and at discharge yielded good correlations between the global VAS-value and the SCL-90-R symptom scores only at discharge. As parameter of therapeutic efficacy the difference of the scores on admission and at discharge was calculated. While the global self-rating (VAS) correlated well with the SCL-90-R scores, no relationship between the GAF-scores and the SCL-90-R scores were found. Schizophrenics and patients suffering behaviour or personality disorders often showed discrepancies of the self- and the therapist rating. These discrepancies offer some hints for the identification of problematic patients. However, the global assessment of therapeutic efficacy often yield controversial results, if the limits of such scores are not considered.

Neuroleptic therapy regarding the following quality criteria was examined for 6 months in an outpatient psychiatric practice: choice of neuroleptics, dosage and combination of additional psychopharmacological medications. 13 different neuroleptics were prescribed to 147 schizophrenic patients, most frequently haloperidol and clozapin. 31% of these patients (n = 147) fell below the dosage recommendations for maintenance therapy. The most frequent psychopharmacological combinations were the combination of two neuroleptics (30%), the combination with lithium or carbamazepin (28%) and the combination with antidepressants (23%). Standardised treatment suggestions as guidelines are valuable for psychiatrists in an outpatients setting. In some cases it is necessary to develop individual treatment strategies that vary from the usual treatment standards.

Consultant Psychiatry confronts the psychiatrist with a wide spectrum range of problems, whereas in his further training in the GFR he is insufficiently prepared for these responsibilities. Therefore, the authors report on a model which has already been tried and tested at the University Hospital in Ulm. Based on the annual data evaluation the authors outline the different questions in psychiatric consultations which are mainly raised and required by the Medical Hospital. In most cases they can be solved in case-focussed team conferences. However, within the framework of interdisciplinary cooperation there are more complex problems solved by regular psychotherapeutic supervision meetings with the whole team. The conditions for this procedure are clearly stated and illustrated by case studies.","2144":"In the inpatient treatment of acute psychiatric episodes in children and adolescents, the psychiatrist must set up an initial treatment plan incorporating one or more psychotherapeutic modalities and adapt this plan to the patient's clinical course. This article summarises the clinical experience of a model unit at the University of Heidelberg, the result of a collaboration between the Department of General Psychiatry and the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Clinic of Psychiatry. A series of 116 adolescent admissions was reviewed for clinical diagnosis, the nature and frequency of psychotherapeutic modalities, and the role of family involvement in patient care. Differential and adaptative approaches to the selection of treatment modalities in the context of an acute care setting are emphasised.","2145":"Sleep deprivation or \"stay awake\"-therapy), given in addition to drug therapy, is seen as an effective anti-depressive treatment with actually no side effects. Nevertheless, it is not regularly and systematically used. A reason for this might be doubts about its feasibility in psychiatric hospitals without specialised depression wards. Only a few reports exist on the practical aspects of sleep deprivation. The present article informs about the \"stay awake\"-therapy on 101 depressive patients (in the mean 25 patient-nights per month), carried out at the Psychiatric Hospital Sanatorium Kilchberg\/Zurich. The patients (age between 19 and 76, mean 47 years) participated on average in 4.4 partial sleep deprivations. 72% participated at least for a set of three nights. One staff person takes care of a group of at most five patients. Indication, organisation, night programme, care and possible strains are reported. A stay awake night (three times a week) consists of breakfast, games, conversations, taking two walks, and discussions about depression and about treatment (psychoeducation), with the aim to avoid naps and to provide a pleasant social event. The experiences made with serial partial sleep deprivation are encouraging.","2146":"","2147":"","2148":"","2149":"","2150":"Since the introduction of the modern psychiatric diagnosis systems anxiety disorders have been intensively discussed.

Depressed patients have significantly higher values in the BDHI subscales \"total aggression\", especially in irritability, negativism, resentment, suspicion and guilt, also in \"attitudional component\", \"inhibited aggression\" and \"covert hostility\". No differences were found in \"assault\" and \"indirect aggression\", controls got significantly higher values in \"verbal aggression\". A comparison of depressed patients with suicide attempts versus depressed patients without such behaviour showed no significant differences. The psychoanalytic hypothesis seems to be useful for depression but not for the suicidal behaviour of depressive patients. ","2155":"A 10-month prospective study of 148 restraints on the acute psychiatric wards of a general hospital aimed to describe the institutional context of restraints. Nursing and medical staff were inquired according to a standardised procedure about ward atmosphere, staffing, medication and other factors. 81% of restraints lasted up to 2 hours, danger of harm to others was found the principal indication criterion (70%). 41% restraints occurred during the first 3 days after admission, mainly within the late shift of nursing staff and outside the regular office hours of the doctors. Ward atmosphere was rated rather relaxed, whereas nursing staff twice as often as doctors rated medication as insufficient. Implications for indication on the use of restraints and for future research are discussed.","2156":"Following a short review of some studies from Germany and Switzerland on coercive measures in psychiatry a retrospective investigation of restraints in the two psychiatric departments of the Medical School of Hannover is presented. Frequency, time, diagnoses, reasons and procedures are reported in detail and discussed in comparison with results of other studies.","2157":"Based upon the psychiatric basic documentation, the incidence of aggressive behaviour before admission and during hospitalisation in a psychiatric hospital was investigated for a six-year period from 1989 through 1994. Aggressive behaviour was found in 8.3% of the patients before admission and in 2.7% during hospitalisation. Injuries to other persons were relatively more frequent in patients with social disorders, mental retardation, dementia and schizophrenic psychoses. The relative risk was increased especially in patients who had injured other persons prior to admission. Considering only the included variables, prediction of aggressive behaviour is not possible with sufficient certainty.","2158":"Records of violent behaviour and its sequels gain increasing interest as a matter of quality assurance. The paper presents scales and instruments applied in psychiatric institutions until now. While problems of reliability are solved sufficiently, there are major problems of validity in the measurement of violence. To be usable for quality management, a documentation has to provide a clear cut-off for the severity of violent incidents that should be reported. Otherwise uncomparable data and underreporting will result.","2159":"This paper reviews the current state of the debate on the relationship between mental disorder and violent behaviour. Starting from the discussion of methodological approaches to assessing a possible association, the most important studies carried out on the issue in recent years are discussed. Their results concur in supporting the assumption that there is a moderate but reliable association between mental disorder and violence. However, this does not imply that people with mental illness are generally more likely to commit violent acts than members of the general population. An elevated risk of violent behaviour is only evident for specific psychiatric diagnoses and for particular symptom constellations. For schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, a significant increase in the likelihood to commit violent acts is reported. Substance use disorder and antisocial personality disorder, however, represent a markedly higher risk for violent behaviour. The article further discusses possible determinant of violent behaviour such as psychotic symptoms and comorbidity with substance abuse, and considers who is at particular risk of becoming a target of violent acts.","2160":"","2161":"","2162":"","2163":"","2164":"","2165":"35 years ago the so-called Rodewisch theses were developed as the results of an international symposium on psychiatric rehabilitation. They were a recognised guideline in psychiatry in the GDR. During the implementation of the theses, ideological and financial limits were soon reached. Several aspects of the theses, such as decentralisation of psychiatric care, the creation of an open psychiatric system and continuity of care are still highly relevant today.","2166":"Several studies [5,6] on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among migrants describe a higher rate of schizophrenic disorders. Other studies [2,3] as well as DSM-IV [1] point out that affective disorders with psychotic symptoms can be misdiagnosed as schizophrenic or schizoaffective disorders. We report on a patient admitted with the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia (ICD-10: F20.0), discussing differential diagnostic criteria and the problems of diagnosing along ICD-10 criteria.","2167":"The study aims at differentiating qualitative and quantitative aspects of inpatient suicide on weekdays and during the weekend. 51 consecutive suicides in a large psychiatric hospital were analysed retrospectively. 14 of 51 suicides occurred during weekend leave, most of them on a Saturday or Sunday. The rate of suicides in the hospital on a Saturday or Sunday is extremely low. Weekend leave from inpatient treatment must be considered as a risk factor of its own. ","2168":"The study collected information on the situation of children of psychotic mothers. Case reports of a total of 279 female patients with schizophrenia or puerperal psychosis were analysed retrospectively. 128 of these patients gave birth to 218 children. Approximately 80% of the children grew up with their families, and only 8% had to be transferred to foster families or foster homes. Two case vignettes illustrate child care problems in a community psychiatric setting. Child care is exercised even in families where mothers suffer from psychotic illness. However, many of these mothers do not receive the help they require. ","2169":"While as a result of the report of the German Federal Government's Inquiry Commission a nationwide programme for further development of the provision of care to the mentally ill was launched, Baden-Wuerttemberg went it's own ways with its \"Programme for the Development of Outpatient Psychiatric Care 1982-1986\". In 1994 Baden-Wuerttemberg's concept of a \"Communal Psychiatric Combine\" (\"Gemeindepsychiatrischer Verbund\", GPV) was worked out; this concept increases in some respects the existing differences from other states. Apart from an improvement in coordination and cooperation, the GPV is intended to secure comprehensive local care provision for the chronically mentally ill. Furthermore, care provision appropriate to requirements should be made possible and quality assurance realised on all levels. In the following, Baden-Wuerttemberg's understanding of a \"Communal Psychiatric Combine\" is contrasted with the combine concept of the expert commission. The potential effects of the reginal care situation as well as the chances of implementation are discussed with reference to earlier experiences.","2170":"The investigation aimed at assessing the prevalence of depression among residents in a nursing home. In a rural area of Germany a representative sample was examined by means of the \"Brief Assessment Interview\" (BAI). 17% had a depressive disorder without dementia, 9% had a mild dementia syndrome and a depressive disorder; a total of 47% suffered from symptoms of dementia without depression. Most of the patients were treated by general practitioners or internists. 11% of the patients with depression were treated with antidepressants, 19% with neuroleptics, 17% with minor tranquillizers, and 17% with hypnotics. Only 20% of the depressive patients had ever been examined by a psychiatrist, 4% underwent an actual psychiatric therapy. Elderly patients with depressive disorders living in nursing homes need a more specific psychiatric treatment. ","2171":"In 1996, the available number of hospital beds for inpatients care in psychiatry, psychotherapy and psychogeriatrics in Sachsen-Anhalt amounted to approximately 0.4 beds per 1,000 inhabitants. As compared to 1992, when most beds were still concentrated in four large psychiatric hospitals, some decentralisation had been achieved. Now, 13 of 23 catchment areas have clinical facilities of their own, five of which were newly founded. About 800 of 1,346 beds and 245 of 299 day hospital places are now located outside the former large institutions. Some of the recently established facilities, however, are not yet sufficiently equipped to serve their catchment areas, with regard to appropriate size, room, staffing, internal specialisation and authorization to cope with compulsory admissions. Even in general hospitals, psychiatric departments are often separated from the main building, with the spatial distance providing some obstacle to the desired cooperation of psychiatry with other medical specialties.","2172":"The main conceptual prerequisites for the development and introduction of a standardised documentation system in psychiatry (in this case: psychosocial rehabilitation) are discussed. These will help to improve the acceptance of the system and optimise the quality of the data. Since the positive motivation of the staff is decisive, it is essential to meet their needs and demands.","2173":"Evaluation of practicability and acceptance of discharge summaries addressed directly to patients after psychiatric hospitalisation. Over a period of 3 months 65 patients got discharge summaries addressed directly to them. Doctors and patients--4 months after discharge--were asked to evaluate this procedure. Both doctors' and patients' acceptance and evaluation was very positive. Argumentations for this view were the need to give and get information and the impression that this procedure can enhance confidence and trust. ","2174":"This paper gives an overall review of the literature since 1980 on the use of valproate in bipolar affective disorders. Randomised comparative studies definitely demonstrate that valproate proves superior in comparison with placebo and equivalent in comparison with lithium in the treatment of acute manic episodes. A series of open studies indicates a reduction in frequency and intensity of manic and depressive episodes with the long-term administration of valproate suggesting efficaciousness in the prophylaxis of bipolar affective disorders. Details on dosage, side effects and potential interactions with this group of patients are presented. Valproate constitutes a further valuable and well tolerated alternative to lithium, antipsychotic agents and carbamazepine not only in acute therapy of manic episodes but also in prophylactic treatment of patients with bipolar psychosis.","2175":"","2176":"","2177":"","2178":"","2179":"","2180":"","2181":"","2182":"To assess the possibility of discharging psychiatric inpatients of two large Mental Hospitals in Lower Austria. A point prevalence study was performed in 1992. Treating psychiatrists were asked to evaluate the possibility to discharge patients under the hypothetical assumption that a broad range of residential facilities were available. The inpatient proportion had decreased from 2179 in 1974 to 1032 in 1992. Of the 1992 population 75.7% might be discharged. Most patients (41.5%) were regarded as needing a permanently staffed home. Although the inpopulation of the two large Mental Hospitals studied had decreased over a period of 18 years already by over 50 percent, the results of this study show that there is a large potential for further reform. Since the evaluation was carried out by the treating psychiatrists in the hospital, who might have been in a conflict of interests or might have preferred the treatment they are providing themselves, this finding is particularly remarkable. ","2183":"The impact of interviewer-effects on subjective evaluative criteria was examined in a randomized control group design (n = 26 x 2) of clients of sheltered living in Berlin-Spandau. The assessment of care and subjective quality of life showed that clients were more satisfied if they had been interviewed by their responsible caregivers compared to interviewers from other providers of the same region--unknown to the clients. Conductibility of interviews was independent of interview conditions. A systematic overestimation of satisfaction should be taken into account if responsible caregivers interview their own clients. Such data should not be used comparing different settings.","2184":"In recent years there has been a tendency in research and clinical treatment to discuss also economic aspects of mental illness in the context of outcome and consequences of treatment for the individual and society. In our study on economic consequences of suicide prevention we could show that a reduction of suicide mortality of depressed patients could save money to the tune of thousands of million Deutschmark.","2185":"The risk of developing clinically relevant psychiatric disorders in the lifetime course is significantly greater among children of mentally ill parents. A child-adapted programme of information concerning the nature and symptomatology of parental illness is considered to be an important preventive factor, and lies within the domain of the psychiatrist's or therapist's responsibilities. During the developmental phase of a prevention project at Freiburg University's Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, both clinical practice and the level of problem awareness among patients and the therapists were evaluated. Over a period of one year, consecutive interviews involving 114 patients with children under 18 years of age, as well as their respective therapists, were conducted. The results showed that: scarcely any exchanges between children and therapists took place; the extent to which children are informed about parental illness must be considered as small; a high percentage of such children are already evaluated by their parents as disturbed, and the pressing need for support exists.","2186":"To reduce insecurities concerning the pros and cons of psychopharmacological treatment of mental disorders during pregnancy, recent papers on teratogenic risks of different (groups of) drugs, and on therapeutic strategies of psychiatry disorders were reviewed and the results summarised. Psychotropic medication sometimes increases the risk of congenital malformations. It may cause peripartal toxicity and neurobehavioral changes; on the other hand, these risks have to be weighted against the proven benefits of the drugs. Untreated mental disorders seriously endanger the offspring during pregnancy and after delivery, and hence psychopharmacological treatment may be advisable in spite of the risks involved.","2187":"The present case study is a report on computer-based training approach in a male patient suffering from the de-Grouchy syndrome I (with a characteristic chromosomal deletion pattern), who along with psychotic symptoms displayed neuropsychological deficits. Participating in a well-established intervention programme aimed at a broad spectrum of psychological functions, the patient went through 36 training sessions. With regard to outcome assessments one focus was on improved performance in the training tasks, while the other one referred to transfer effects, as indexed by a neuropsychological test battery which was given before and after the entire programme. In both areas substantial gains from training emerged according to the collected data. In view of these results neuropsychological training approaches appear to have a perspective even in behavioural deficits with a genetic basis.","2188":"Using computer-assisted cognitive training to treat patients with cognitive disorders has proved a useful tool in neurological rehabilitation. This has been shown by positive experience in many rehabilitation clinics but also in numerous control studies investigating the efficiency of such training. Patients with attention deficits show the most pronounced improvements as the computer with its technical possibilities is an ideal training instrument because of stimulus representation and reaction time measures. In other areas, computer training has become an essential therapeutic means complementing other therapies. In a clinical environment it seems that computer training is essential because it enables attaining the necessary therapeutic density. However, training must be integrated and become part of a global therapeutic framework.","2189":"The paper deals with the evaluation of a computer-based cognitive group training programme for schizophrenic patients. The evaluation of the training results of 100 patients who participated in an earlier training scheme showed ceiling effects in up to 46% of the cases. In the remaining cases the improvements varied in a wide range between 1.6 and 20%. These results implied that the training had to be adapted more closely to the specific needs of the individual patient. To this end we developed criteria for each task to decide whether training in this task is necessary or the performance is sufficient. This approach limits training to those tasks in which patients display deficits. Satisfactory improvement terminating training for the specific task, is defined as an increase in correct responses of at least 10%. For those tasks in which reaction times are used as performance measure, the criterion is a 10% increase in percentile rank. An analysis of the new training programme with the data of 20 patients revealed that 27% of the tasks showed ceiling performance with no further training need. In the remaining tasks the patients' performance attained the training criterion in 68%, at instances mostly even after one additional session. These preliminary results indicate that the new training scheme is able to provide more flexibility, individualization and an enhanced focus on the patients' deficits.","2190":"Recent years witnessed a considerable proliferation of computer-based training programmes as instruments of cognitive rehabilitation for schizophrenic patients. A study on the effects of a 3-week computer-based attention training with schizophrenic patients is presented. The Span of Apprehension and the Continuous Performance Test (CTP) were carried out before and after the training period. Performance improvements were found only on few attention training tasks. Schizophrenics had higher post-treatment hit rates on the Span of Apprehension, but no post-treatment improvements were observed in the CPT. Performance of trained patients in the external attention measures was not superior to performance of matched schizophrenic control patients. These data suggest that brief intensive computer-based attention remediation does not lead to enhanced attentional capacity in schizophrenia. Thus, it might be more adequate to teach behavioural strategies that bypass attention deficits or to offer programmes for exercising more complex cognitive skills than to try to remedy basic cognitive impairments.","2191":"","2192":"","2193":"An 80-year old previously healthy woman with recent onset of binocular macular degeneration presented for clinical psychiatric evaluation of elaborate complex visual hallucinations. In the absence of other organic or psychiatric findings the patient maintained insight into the unreal nature of her visions. As neuroleptic drugs showed no effect, low dose treatment with carbamazepin resulted in disappearance of hallucinations. The phenomenon of Charles-Bonnet-syndrome is discussed as an example of a neuro-psychiatric hallucinosis.","2194":"We report on a 50-year old patient who on admission to hospital demonstrated several disorders of sensation of her body which seemed to be bizarre and exclusively caused by a psychotic disorder. It soon turned out that a somatological disorder was of primary importance. The symptoms of the somatic disorder had been assimilated and shaped psychotically. This serves to show that every patient should be examined carefully for somatic disorders regardless of whether existing disorders of sensation are bizarre or not.","2195":"Vocational rehabilitation of mentally ill patients is now focused outside the psychiatric hospital. Three types of programmes play a major role: outpatient work therapy programmes at psychiatric hospitals, jobs in (partly) sheltered employment facilities as in companies specially adapted for employing mentally ill persons, and workshops for the mentally disabled. In the north-western German region of Westphalia-Lippe (population: 9 million) we carried out a three-year prospective study on a regionally representative sample from such rehabilitation institutions to assess the course and outcome of vocational rehabilitation. The sample comprised 295 men and 176 women with a mean age of 36.1 year (+\/- 9.6). The majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent long-term hospitalisation. 61% of all probands were suffering from schizophrenic disorders. The outcome of vocational rehabilitation differs substantially among the three programme types, primarily due to varying baseline conditions, subjective expectations or goals, and courses of illness. The programmes are not alternatives but should be seen as supplementary components of a care system which has to meet a wide range of patient requirements. Vocational integration into the open labour market is a desirable and realistic objective for only some of those concerned.","2196":"Prior to discharge 351 patients in a psychiatric ward of a general hospital were requested to complete a 31-question survey pertaining to their hospital stay. The highest marks were given to the nursing staff and the individual psychiatric therapy. The survey also reflected dissatisfaction with the doctors' rounds led by the medical director, the information given about the medications and the early morning exercise programme. The patients were very cooperative and took the questions seriously. The questionnaire should not contain more than 10 clear and simple questions. The very act of posing the questions to the patients brought about changes in the ward. ","2197":"In a two-year follow-up we report on discharges in a cohort of 422 middle-term and long-term inpatients and prognoses of their psychiatrists and psychologists concerning time of discharge and location, after 50% long-term patients with a present stay of more than two years and 82% of middle-term patients (stay: 6-24 months) had been discharged. More than one-third of the long-term patients could be placed in sheltered accommodation, but 42% are still referred to nursing homes. All together 68% are still in institutional settings--either as inpatients or in nursing homes. Prognoses were not very reliable concerning the time of discharge but substantial with regard to placement in sheltered accommodation. This can be interpreted as a result of successful co-operation between inpatient and community-based services.","2198":"As in most parts of Switzerland, there was a lack of possibility to hospitalise adolescents in specialised psychiatric wards. In 1993, after a long preparatory period, it became possible to admit the first patient to the newly established adolescent psychiatric department at Basel, a subunit of the university hospital. The department is conceived as an open ward, where patients are being cared for by an interdisciplinary team of psychiatric nurses and paedagogics, besides many other professionals. Milieutherapeutic techniques, psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are practised side by side. The conceptional ideas, gradual building of the ward and the experience of the first three years clinical experiences are summarised in this article.","2199":"By and large, pharmacokinetic interactions are described: macrolide antibiotics, isoniazid, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin can lead to toxic concentrations of psychotropic drugs, while rifampicin causes subtherapeutic levels. Vice versa, carbamazepine might induce subtherapeutic plasma concentrations of doxycycline. These interactions are caused by inhibition or induction of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Case reports suggest lithium intoxication through concomitant use of tetracycline, metronidazol and spectinomycin, which is contradicted by animal studies. Clinical symptoms depend on the therapeutic index of a given drug, e.g. toxic and subtherapeutic levels are described for clozapine but not for haloperidol. No relevant pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions are described, although, the author emphasises psychiatric side effects of macrolide antibiotics, isoniazid, beta-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones. On the whole, drug-drug interactions of antibiotics and psychotropics seem rare and usually benign, though more subtle interactions might be overlooked.","2200":"","2201":"","2202":"A patient with chronic paranoid schizophrenia with delusions of infestation and of grandeur type, developed polydipsia in the course of his illness which ended up in acute life-threatening water intoxication. Apart from somatic causes like SIADH, which are discussed in literature, water-intoxication could psychodynamically be interpreted in the sense of acting on delusions.","2203":"We report on the case of a man, whose psychopathological symptoms markedly varied during different phases of his illness, causing difficulties in applying common diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. Depending upon each of the predominant symptoms, this resulted in different diagnoses and therapeutic strategies. We also discuss the importance of obsessions and compulsions in differential diagnosis in this case.","2204":"Treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia is very expensive. However, by consistently and methodically performed medical prophylaxis the disease can be controlled sufficiently well. Regular prophylactic treatment compared to repeated treatment of acute episodes has both medical advantages and reduces cost by reducing the rate of hospitalisation. Prophylactic treatment with Flupentixoldecanoat can save up to 68% of costs.","2205":null,"2206":"Since 1993 we have been working with nine groups of relatives of schizophrenic patients who were admitted as inpatients to two different psychiatric wards at the Landesklinik Nordschwarzwald. We summarise our experience with the family groups as a part of the psychiatric care for schizophrenic patients. The concept of family groups combines psychoeducational aspects with the concept of \"Expressed Emotion\". The relatives valued the combination of information, discussion and exchange of experiences positively. The groups offer relief and support. The involvement of the relatives has proved useful in the treatment of schizophrenic patients at our institution and will be continued. Further studies designed to improve the efficiency and quality of family groups will be important for their general establishment in psychiatric care.","2207":"To evaluate the effect of a psychoeducational training, compliance, medication management, and illness-related attitudes were assessed among schizophrenic outpatients. Study patients who attended at least 70% of 10 psychoeducational sessions (n = 74) and the 57 patients of the control group were reexamined 2 years after the end of intervention. Attenders had better compliance, were more confident in medication codetermination and more satisfied with their knowledge about medication. Confidence in medication and physician increased whereas in the control both decreased. Although there were no statistically significant differences the results show impressive longterm effects of psychoeducational training. ","2208":"In this study we examined subjective views other than the usually studied quality of life, needs and treatment satisfaction, of first-admitted schizophrenic patients. Data of 90 patients were gathered with two established and a new questionnaire. Signs of anxious unrest and loss of vigour are the most frequently reported complaints in patients as well as in a sample of the Berlin general population that was also studied but with a clearly higher incidence in the patients. Patients are most often burdened by concerns regarding their disease and their objective living conditions, especially work. They experience social contacts and leisure activities as helpful. The findings suggest that complaints, burdens, worries and the fear of negative consequences--rather than being an expression of specific schizophrenic symptoms--are a non-specific reaction to a difficult and burdensome situation. In clinical practice, special consideration of this reaction and of the social conditions seems useful. ","2209":"Social representations of mental illness and psychiatry are largely influenced by mass media. This study explores the use of the term \"schizophrenia\" in the Swiss newspaper NZZ in 1994 and 1995, the text of which is available on CD-ROM. In 31% of the cases the term is used figuratively, i.e. as a metaphor. When used as a name of an illness, it reflects contradictory connotations: schizophrenics as mentally ill offenders or criminal in the local columns, schizophrenics featuring as creative writers or artists in the cultural columns. Information on schizophrenia as disease is rare. If it does occur, reporting is rather sociopsychiatric than neurobiological.","2210":null,"2211":"Both in classical German psychiatry and in the contemporary operationalized diagnostic systems schizophrenia is conceptualised as a categorical disorder, the presence or absence of which can be verified dichotomously. Empirical results, however, suggest that schizophrenia might be a dimensional disorder. The categorical perspective has advantages for epidemiological research; it produced important results like the finding of a world-wide equal incidence of schizophrenia. Increasing importance is attributed to the definition of criteria, especially those of duration, which is arbitrary in many aspects. Results of research concerning the course of illness and sex distribution vary, depending on the definition of criteria, giving rise to different etiological hypotheses.","2212":"","2213":"","2214":"","2215":"","2216":"","2217":"","2218":"","2219":"","2220":"Single case reports are common in Anglo-Saxon but not in German medical journal.

During these episodes the patient experienced a dissociated state of consciousness with REM sleep intrusions into wakefulness. The occurrence of this mixed state, and of excessive sleep-onset REM periods during daytime polysomnography (MSLT = Multiple Sleep Latency Test), point to a disorder of REM sleep generation. The existence of narcolepsy could be ruled out. The observation of REM sleep-associated hallucinations has been reported earlier. In the presented polysomnographic sleep studies the existence of a REM sleep associated parasomnia characterised by hallucinations and sleep paralysis could be confirmed.","2223":"Acute and chronic intoxications caused by bromides have become rare. The psychopathology of such intoxications can present with various symptoms. We report on the case of a 55-year-old man who was admitted with an acute delirium due to chronic bromide intoxication. In this context we briefly discuss clinical, psychopathological and therapeutic aspects of substance abuse and chronic bromide intoxication.","2224":"The conventional form of detoxication for illicit drug users in German psychiatric hospitals is an inpatient treatment approach connected with high admission prerequisites. These demand a high stage of motivational compliance from of the patients, e.g. the determination to continue with long-term treatment aiming at a life free of drugs. This strategy is termed \"high-threshold\" approach. A new form of inpatient treatment is the \"low-threshold\" approach offering intervals of some days or weeks free of drugs to illicit drug users, supported by professional detoxication strategies. This study compares client characteristics of illicit drug users treated at \"high-threshold\" vs. \"low-threshold\" units. A new subpopulation of clients could be reached who are more advanced in their drug intake careers and less influenced by social pressure to enter treatment. The differences in clients treated can be explained rather by differences in admission prerequisites than by a more balanced distribution of sexes in the newly introduced detoxication programme.","2225":"In 1994, two methadone outpatient treatment departments, providing a combined therapy of substitution and psychosocial care, were set up in Munich. Indication for treatment is established according to the guidelines for new treatment and diagnostic methods (NUB guidelines), focussing mainly on NUB 2.3, on account of the high psychiatric comorbidity. After 1 1\/2 years a total of 102 addicts had received treatment. More than half of these patients were then hospitalized for detoxification. Substitution therapy enabled many of these patients to improve their work and home situations. A corresponding reduction in the use of drugs was also observed, especially in the case of opiates. The programme has therefore been successful similar to the results of the substitution study of Hamburg.","2226":null,"2227":"With regard to experiences described in the literature, and the particular psychotherapeutic and paedagogic effects on mother and child in the inpatient treatment setup presented in this paper, we give an account of the preliminary deliberations and preconditions arising from this particular setup. Prognostically unfavourable aspects of joint admission and treatment are also presented. Finally, previous experiences are discussed, and suggestions for improvement of care for mentally ill mothers and their infants or toddlers are made, taking into consideration the facilities existing in England and Denmark.","2228":"In a large University Department of Psychiatry a retrospective analysis of 712 psychiatric expertises on fitness to drive was carried out to identify factors influencing the decision \"unfit to drive\". Psychological test results were identified as the most potent factors influencing this decision, whereas a psychiatric diagnosis seems to be less important. The results indicate that demographic data and history (previous psychiatric hospitalisations, previous verdict \"unfit to drive\") were not influential. It is concluded that today's psychiatrists, when carrying out expertises on the question of fitness to drive, do not follow previous recommendations of placing a verdict of \"unfit to drive\" on all persons with a psychiatric diagnosis. They obviously follow a more individualised and pragmatic approach.","2229":"Despite of the frequency of depressive disorders among the population, forensic aspects of depression are rare and usually focussed on suicidal behaviour, especially the so-called homicide-suicide (homicide followed by suicide). Today therapeutic strategies are seen in the first stage of dealing with depressed homicide-suicide attempters. Apart from the question of guilt with regard to the homicidal act, the question of recurrence of depression and the danger of a possibly repeated homicidal-suicidal behaviour are discussed in the light of three clinical cases.","2230":"Sexual and\/or physical abuse can be found in large numbers in the history of severely disturbed borderline patients. The treatment of experiences of incest can induce new symptoms as well as reinforce still existing symptoms. Thus the free-floating anxiety, which is connected with the anxiety of impending doom in early childhood, can be reduced. During in-patient treatment the extent of free-floating anxiety of borderline patients can be reduced by the holding function of the therapeutic team. Reduction of the other symptoms can take place only subsequent to this. A therapy geared to the reduction of singular symptoms might be less successful.","2231":"","2232":"","2233":"","2234":"","2235":"","2236":"","2237":"","2238":"","2239":"","2240":"A mentally healthy woman killed her newborn directly after parturition.

The patient showed signs of vascular encephalopathy after perinatal brain damage; besides that, he had developed a mild \"explanatory\" delusional system. Under treatment with SSRI and clozapin he improved remarkably. Presenting this case, we discuss the connection between organic disorders and OCD, and especially its relationship to perinatal brain damage.","2242":"In a cross-sectional study we analysed the present situation of mentally disordered offenders treated in forensic hospitals of North Rhine-Westphalia under section 63 StGB-in comparison with the first block sampling in 1984. One of the important findings was that there has been an increase in violence in respect of the index delinquency as well as the criminal record. Those patients who were again committed to a forensic hospital showed more violent criminal offences too. The average duration of hospitalisation has been reduced from 6.1 to 4.8 years.","2243":"Three years ago in Linz the crisis intervention service started to offer mobile crisis intervention during the night and on weekends. The article presents concept, organisation of the service and statistical data. Although the crisis intervention service is responsible for a region with 330,000 inhabitants the utilization of mobile crisis intervention is low.","2244":"This is a report on the authors' experience over two years in developing a new way to deal with patient suicides in a District Psychiatric Hospital. The main aim of the Suicide Counselling Session is to help the involved hospital ward teams to overcome the strain, doubt and psychological burden often caused by the suicide of a patient. The authors describe the institutional conditions and setting in which a Suicide Counselling Session takes place. The method is characterised by a special attitude and the ideas of \"Reflecting Team\" to bring the involved stress factors into the open.","2245":"The psychiatric services of the Swiss region of Basel-Landschaft observed an increasing deterioration and shortage of accommodation offers for mentally ill persons. At the same time, it grew temporarily more and more difficult to let single rooms in flat-sharing communities. Therefore a psychiatric services research project aimed at evaluating the wishes and needs of specialists in the housing sphere, and of about 600 in- and outpatients, as well as for their caregivers. The results showed, similar to other studies, on the one hand patients' predominant wish to live independently, whereas on the other hand there was a great difference between the views of patients and their caregivers. The latter view this aspiration for independence rather skeptically. The striking disagreement between patients and caregivers may be fruitful for the therapeutic process; however, this applies only if both partners are aware of this fact.","2246":"Objective living situation, subjective quality of life, need for care, and assessment of treatment of long-term hospitalised patients were investigated. 237 patients from 6 hospitals were examined using standardised instruments. Patients' satisfaction was generally relatively high, but varied greatly in subgroups and individuals. Patients were most satisfied with personal safety in the hospital and least satisfied with the expectation to live in the hospital for a long time. Therapists assessed clearly more needs for care in the patients than the patients did themselves. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between the subjective quality of life in different domains, the number of needs stated and plausible determining factors. Findings reflecting patients' living situation in the hospital are very heterogeneous. In respect of subjective evaluation criteria, there is little space for improvement in the future. ","2247":"This study aimed at the systematic assessment of the burden imposed on the relatives of mentally ill persons. A postal survey was carried out on a sample drawn from the members of the Federal Association of Relatives of the Mentally ill (n = 557). Almost one third of those questioned experienced the care for their relatives as a heavy burden, a further third said that the burden was moderate. Among the negative consequences, health impairment was cited most often. Two-thirds of the participants reported constraints on their everyday life and the organisation of their leisure time. A (partly considerable) financial burden was cited with similar frequency. Further, the illness had a negative impact on the personal relationships of the caregivers. A quarter of the sample had lost touch with other family members. The same was found with regard to contact with friends. One-third reported discrimination by their environment. The results emphasize the necessity of creating opportunities to relieve some of the burden on relatives.

In contrast with reports from the literature there were no obvious neurologic signs and symptoms which would have indicated the organic nature of the illness. Therefore, the correct diagnosis was based on a careful anamnesis, clinical and psychopathological examination and confirmatory results of serological tests.","2258":"A random sample of patients (n = 43) had been investigated to detect any difference in response of bright light therapy in lithium-treated inpatients (n = 18) suffering from depression. Only 27% of the lithium-based inpatients respond to bright light therapy, but 73% of patients respond who were not treated with lithium. We conclude that lithium therapy reduces the chance of achieving t remission of depression by bright light therapy.","2259":"Members of the family of origin and spouses have been invited to take part in a cognitive-behavioral treatment programme for incarcerated sexual offenders to support the offender. Offenders arranged appointments with their spouses, mother, fathers and the therapist. A one-year follow-up reveals considerable change in denying and minimisation of responsibility, forcefullness and degree of sexual intrusiveness of both the offenders and the spouses. Both groups showed a better understanding for and a more positive attitude to the offenders' sexuality. Furthermore, both groups showed a significant increase in applying concepts of relapse prevention.","2260":"In particular studies conducted in the U.S. display a tendency for schizophrenics to combine hallucinogens and amphetamines, whereas other studies report on a combination of psychotropic substances with a similar range of action. Influencing negative symptoms is reported to be the motivation for consumption. A total of 222 patients with a schizophrenic disorder (F2) and addiction (F1) were examined. The main substance was alcohol (F10.1 or F10.2; 52.2%), followed by cannabis (F12; 25%), opiates (F11; 4.1%), sedatives or hypnotics (F13; 2.7%) and cocaine (F16; 0.5%). A multiple drug use (F19) is reported by 14% of them. The most frequent combination was alcohol and cannabis, whereas hallucinogens and amphetamines were only rarely combined. Actual multiple consumption was reported by 55% of the patients, while lifetime multiple consumption applied to 72%. The motivation seems to be an unspecified sedation of unpleasant affective symptoms of schizophrenia. The most frequently seen combinations do not correlate with the reports published in the literature. The great variations in motivation seem to mainly reflect the importance of the availability of the substance.","2261":"To protect patients' autonomy, valid informed consent must be given prior to medical treatment. This includes disclosure of information, understanding, ability to decide freely, and competence\/capacity of the patient. However, a psychiatric disorder may disturb the ability to make a choice of their own. These patients have lost their competence to give valid informed consent. In everyday practice of social psychiatry, it is of particular interest to have objective and valid criteria to identify the incompetent patient. These problems are discussed in a case report, and four criteria (understanding, reasoning, decision making and appreciation of the disorder) are presented to diagnose the patients' competence.","2262":"Especially in the inpatient treatment of adolescents the phase of termination is decisive, because important issues and developmental tasks are re-experienced by the young patient. Therefore a sufficient relief from symptoms cannot serve as the main criterium for termination. Instead the ego-development with all its aspects and the improvement of the capacity for emotional relationship is most important. The paper discusses some central dynamic factors of the termination phase. Most of these processes are also induced inside the therapeutic team thus leading also to a kind of separation crisis in the team.","2263":"Characteristics of 43 inpatient treatments of mother and child as carried out up to now, are described diagnostically and under a descriptive statistics aspect. The procedure of the staff is described, and the significance of the proceedings for the development of the child is also referred too. Specific problems (mothers with infants, mothers with toddlers, pre- and postnatal psycho-pharmaceutical therapy) are highlighted by means of case reports, or cameos.","2264":"In a psychiatric hospital with 3174 admissions in a year, 31% of the mentally ill and addicted patients have no private home. These homeless patients are surviving in different ways: 1. homeless without any kind of housing; living in the streets for a long time with high risks of morbidity and mortality; 2. living in shelters or hostels; 3. residents of local homes; 4. patients still have their private homes but they are urged to leave in the near future or they are living in dangerous circumstances with high risks for health. Case-management by social-workers and local political interventions are necessary to act against these high risk health problems of homeless patients in a psychiatric hospital.","2265":"The state of Anglo-American research on psychiatric disorders among homeless persons is summarised. Several authors reported on life-time prevalence (50-75%) and present prevalence rates (30-50%) of psychiatric disorders in this population. Alcohol-related and drug-related disorders were most frequent. Most studies, however, only included single and male subjects, while there is little information on homeless persons living with a partner or in a family. Up to now, no representative studies exist. Some recent investigations evaluated classic single case models versus case management approaches. Short-term programmes only yielded short-term effects, but linking psychiatric and social services seems to improve health service utilization by the homeless.","2266":"","2267":"","2268":"","2269":"","2270":"","2271":"Emigration is often followed by psychic disorders. The special issue of Germans from the GUS-States immigrating to Germany is presented. The modus of paranoid reaction is discussed along the biography and the criteria of ICD 10. The acute paranoid psychosis was complicated by a neuroleptic malignant syndrome.","2272":"Today it is uncontested that some psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia occur transculturally despite their culture-dependent symptomatical variations. In the following text we discuss the case of a Chinese patient emigrated to Switzerland. Different culture-dependent appreciation of facts and therapeutic approaches by her family and by the treatment team influenced the course of the psychotic disorder.","2273":"Newspapers reports on ECT are extremely biased. A quantitative analysis of four German and Swiss papers demonstrates impressingly the change of meaning of synonymous terms like \"Elektroschock\" and \"Schocktherapie\" which refer to torture and brutal reforms of Eastern European communist economies.","2274":null,"2275":"187 general hospital patients were questioned in a prospective study with a semistructured interview about their subjective experience and assessment of the psychiatric consultation. Over 40% complained that they had been given insufficient information about the psychiatric consultation by their primary care physician. It was rarely (10%) found to be unpleasant, and 46% of the patients specifically stated that it had been valuable. In order to improve the efficiency of the psychiatric consultation more attention should be paid to the subjective judgement of the patients.","2276":null,"2277":"Aspects of a Pilot Study on Depression Treatment According to Quality Monitoring and External Quality Assurance: Experiences and results of a pilot study on quality of the treatment of depressed inpatients in 4 different psychiatric hospitals (2 state mental hospitals, 1 university clinic, 1 psychiatric clinic at a city general hospital) according to so-called process and outcome quality, are reported. Outcome data (self-ratings, observer rating, clinical global impression admission versus discharge, patient satisfaction with treatment, duration of inpatient stay\/and patient data are reported while comparing the 4 hospitals. Difficulties and problems of data collection, assessments and comparison of 4 different hospitals are discussed.","2278":null,"2279":"Having outlined the background of psychoeducational intervention in the treatment of schizophrenic disorders the goals of family psychoeducation and of psychoeducation are described. Two formats of family psychoeducation are discussed to illustrate the differences in form of intervention. Especially the underlying illness concept and anthropology are critically assessed: it is worth nothing that patients and relatives are provided with a somatic illness concept not consistent with current research evidence and which may support passive illness-management strategies. Finally, the reduction of psychoeducational treatment to the improvement of medication compliance is discussed.","2280":"In the context of discussions on the re-organisation of specialities in psychiatry and psychological therapy recent studies on the prevalence of psychogenic disorders in different psychiatric institutions are presented and compared with the communications available so far. Despite the availability of excellent psychotherapeutic care units, more than one third of the patients in psychiatric units suffer from psychogenic disorders (inpatient units 30 per cent, outpatient and emergency units 45 per cent). This leads to an increasing demand on the competence and responsibility of the psychiatrist. Focus is on three main issues. It follows that the psychiatrist must also be conversant in psychotherapy. The advantages of combining and coordinating both fields during specialist training are discussed in this paper.","2281":"","2282":"","2283":"","2284":"Recently, American authors pronounced the hypothesis that Clozapine-response may be considered as a predictor of response to atypical neuroleptic. We report the history of a schizoaffektive patient unresponsive to butyrophenone and phenothiazine neuroleptic who was first treated with Clozapine and then with Risperidone and who reacted very differently to these atypical neuroleptic.","2285":"Health insurance companies commission medical expert opinions rating the severity of clinical improvement in order to provide adequate nursing support. We compared these ratings on 28 demented patients with the ratings from carers and with our own examination. The results indicate that the expert opinions underestimated the severity of improvement and adequate support in some of the cases. We discuss whether these discrepancies may be due to the peculiarities of dementia.","2286":"369 patients of a crisis intervention center, treated in 1985, were seen in follow-up-studies 3 and 9 years after admission. The catamnesis was done by an open questionnaire and standardized inventories. The mean value of hospital stay was 3.98 days. Complete data were received from 144 resp. 138 persons. 9 persons died by suicide during the first three years after admission. During the next 6 years most of the patients were stabilized. Minimal effectivity and stability was observed for alcoholics and drug dependent patients.","2287":"Psychotherapeutical groups in Psychiatry--different to traditional Psychotherapy--are often carried out as open groups; the patient, not bound to a previous commitment to long-term and reliable attendance, is authorized to determine for himself how long he will take part in the group. Though in this way it is possible to decrease the threshold of participation in the group, on the other hand this may cause risk of an extreme high fluctuation. The analysis of a group of psychiatric patients shows that in spite of the open form, lack of a waiting list, and a faint motivation of newly admitted participants, considerable stability can be obtained.","2288":"Several studies Conducted during the last 30 years have shown the high prevalence of mental disorder among patients of general practitioners (GPs). The integration of out patients care of schizophrenics into primary care remains controversial. Yet there is a lack of studies determining the subjective view of clients on their choice of their physician. In this study we interviewed in patient schizophrenics on their choice of physician for out patient care. 27.3% were being treated only by a GP, 29.9% only by a psychiatrist and 36.4% by a GP and a psychiatrist. Those treated only by a GP knew him a lot longer. The appraisal was more positive for those treated only by a GP, while those treated by both psychiatrist and GP rated the competence of the psychiatrist more positive by. Those treated by both GP and psychiatrist had the longest length of illness, yet the lowest rate of rehospitalisation. Although these results cannot only be seen as a result of the choice of physician, they still confirm the importance of interdisciplinary cooperation and should encourage GPs and psychiatrists to recommend their schizophrenics to be treated cooperatively. ","2289":"8% of the men and approximately 0.5% of the women in a normal population suffer from congenital colour anomaly. We examined 75 women suffering from endogenous depressions. We found disturbed colour vision in 63% of them. We discuss the aetiopathogenic relationship between endogenous depression and disturbed colour vision.","2290":"Five case reports with psychiatric disorders prior to the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis are presented and discussed in relation to relevant scientific literature. Particularly the possibility of a causal correlation between psychopathological abnormalities and the CNS-inflammation is investigated. According to several reports and the own observations one has to consider the possibility of a (pure) psychotic onset of multiple sclerosis. The differential diagnosis in patients with psychotic illness should therefore include the encephalitic form of MS. Further studies with a standardized setting and a definite population basis are necessary to expand the knowledge in the epidemiology of psychiatric disturbances in MS.","2291":"Assessment and analysis of first medical consultations and their significance in panic disorder patients. 90 panic disorder patients were interviewed concerning their experiences with the medical system at the time of their first panic attack. Panic disorder patients contacted mostly non-psychiatric medical services at the time of their first panic attack. The correct diagnosis was established in only 4 cases (5.6%). An important chance for secondary prevention of the development of panic disorder is missed, probably due to the poor education of physicians on panic attacks. ","2292":"605 German psychiatrists were asked what they consider important ingredients of the quality of life of schizophrenic patients. Most frequently, quality of life was associated with social integration. Work, social contacts and acceptance on the part of their environment were considered particularly important in this respect. The second rank was occupied by the absence of symptoms of the disorder and a sufficient capacity and fitness for work, as well as social competence to meet the demands of their social environment, and to be capable of living independently. In addition, the limitation to a minimum of suffering from the side-effects of psychopharmacotherapy was held to be relevant for the patients' quality of life. Adequate psychiatric care was least frequently regarded as a prerequisite.","2293":"Basing on the growing interest in the work with relatives of mentally ill people, psychiatric inpatient treatment of mentally ill mothers together with their infants or toddlers is described. The introductory overview gives an account of various international experiences with psychiatric inpatient treatment of mother and child, the conditions existing especially in England are described, and hints are given in respect of the need to adopt that treatment model.","2294":"","2295":"","2296":"","2297":"","2298":"","2299":"","2300":"","2301":"This is the case of a patient who received psychiatric treatment for a period of over 60 years. For the most part he received drug treatment, initially also involving electroshock therapy combined with pyretotherapy. During the last 20 years he lived (and worked) in a psychiatric home with an adjoining agricultural farm. He died at the age of 94.","2302":"We present the development of an 9-year therapeutic relationship with a patient suffering from epilepsy and a severe personality disorder. Despite serious doubts in the beginning the patient gained an unexpected degree of independence. The development of the case indicates that it was decisive to prevent discontinuation of the personal relationship due to separation of in-patient and out-patient treatment. Only by personal continuity over years it has been possible for the patient to continue therapy with the consequence of getting a satisfactory autonomy.","2303":"With a mean duration of hospitalisation of 28 years the patients of a long-term hospital had on the average only 2.6 visits from outside in one year. Above all the frequency of visits depended on the age, the duration of illness, the distance of the hospital to the homes of the patients and on communication inhibiting symptoms. In a three years follow-up the social integration of patients could be improved by specific rehabilitative treatment. Contacts to persons from outside the hospital and activities inside increased significantly. Improvement was not possible for patients whose homes were very far away and who had communication inhibiting symptoms at the outset of the follow-up.","2304":"In German language the two terms \"Soziale Psychiatrie\" and \"Sozialpsychiatrie\" are used without any clear distinction. In this paper a historical analysis of the connotations of the two terms is made while underlying concepts are not considered. In the 19th century the words social and medicine were connected. At the beginning of the 20th century the terms \"Soziale Psychiatrie\" and \"Sozialpsychiatrie\" appeared in German as synonyma. In Germany-unlike, for instance, in the USA-ideas of segregation of the mentally ill and of eugenics were also regarded as \"Soziale Psychiatrie\". In difference to this connotation \"Soziale Psychiatrie\" described intentedly ideological positions in the 70's, while a certain of area of research was rather associated with \"Sozialpsychiatrie\". Finally, a more precise use of the terms is suggested for current discussions.","2305":"\"Socio-geographic reconstruction\" means to recall important places and stations of life, accompanied by another interested person. Students of social paedagogics have created these reconstructions together with long-term psychiatric patients. The method is based on social science participation studies. The aim is the rediscovering and reacquiring the prepsychiatric biography of the patients as well as the understanding of this history by the students. The focus of interest is not the \"history of illness\" but the \"history of life\" as it was connected with family, school, work and leisure time.","2306":"Several science history studies have recently focussed on the fate of the first German-speaking lady jurist qualified for lecturing in jurisprudence. Emilie Kempin-Spyri (1853-1901), a niece of the Swiss author Johanna Heusser Spyri who wrote the classical children's story Heidi. In practically all these studies, Emilie Kempin-Spyri's mental disturbance has been instrumentalised for developing historical, sociological of feministic theses. Basing on recourse to hitherto unpublished material excepted from hospital records, the authors of the present article examine the psychiatric perspectives of the interlinking of life and patient history. Taking as an example the manner in which the life and death of Emilie Kempin-Spyri has been visualised in the literature, the authors point out that mental disease is mainly viewed under the aspect of a possible interpretation or significance of the person and his or her life. In this manner, science history and biographical studies exercise an influence also on today's social representations of mental disease.","2307":"In 1914, Robert Gaupp published his monographic study on \"Wagner, Schoolteacher from Degerloch\", constituting his theory on the characterogenic development of paranoia which he believed was induced in Wagner's case by the patient's sexual-ethical conflict regarding his (questionable) sodomistic behaviour. The following paper examines Gaupp's approach and methods during the process leading to his final diagnosis.","2308":"The great importance of the \"illenau\", the so-called \"first model asylum of the Germans\" (letter) has been increasingly appreciated in recent years. This article describes the \"illenau\" especially as place of education for young psychiatrists. It seems legitimate to speak of the \"illenau psychiatric school\" in respect of its function for the practical education of young psychiatrists, but not as a special academic mode of teaching or research.","2309":"","2310":"","2311":"","2312":"","2313":"","2314":"","2315":"","2316":"Although treatment outcome in alcoholism is good and well documented, many patients are not sufficiently motivated for participating in a treatment program.

Patients and staff members were questioned about the ward climate before and after changing the admission procedure. The male patients merely noticed a decreased influence of sexual problems on the ward atmosphere. The female patients evaluated the new ward for women as an improvement. In particular, assistance and clarity of conditions were more positively assessed. The staff members of the previous open ward noticed a significant increase in annoyance and aggression after closing the ward and segregation of the sexes. In general, segregation of the sexes did not result in deterioration of the ward atmosphere.","2321":"Ward atmosphere was assessed with the help of the Ward Atmosphere Scale (WAS) by patients, nurses and physicians on 8 admission units before and after the introduction of the partial open door system. On average, on 45% of the days on which the units could have been potentially open, they were indeed at least temporarily open. Several significant changes in the WAS scores, mostly in desirable direction, were registered. However, close relationship with the partial opening of the units could be substantiated only with regard to the scale \"praxis orientation\"; still a positive result. No unequivocal relationships could be demonstrated between the introduction of the partial open door system and the changes in the frequency of \"special events\".","2322":"The development of the social situation of 69 DMS-III schizophrenic out-patients is described in an 8 years follow-up. Originally all patients had lived with their relatives. Patients who lived with spouses or alone (each 20%) had quite a good outcome and a fair social integration. After 8 years 40% still lived with parents. They needed much support from them for their course of illness was moderate. 20% lived in sheltered accommodations and had a poor integration. For all the relatives were the most important reliable persons in social networks which decreased during the course of illness.","2323":"","2324":"German Health Legislation has recently issued regulations for cuts in health expenditure. One of the new proposed services is pre- and post in-patient treatment services. Hitherto their realization has mainly been seen in somatic disciplines, mainly surgery. The author shows that psychiatry will gain more efficiency and quality of psychiatric care through implementation of these services. The threefold spectrum of psychiatric treatment facilities (in-patient, out-patient, day-treatment) will thus be upgraded into a five-dimensional treatment. It is shown, that most of these new treatment facilities have been lain dormant in day-to-day psychiatric practice, the new legislation helps the psychiatric profession to set them in motion. Examples for possible use are given.","2325":"With respect to the methodological problems concerning the outcome evaluation of crisis intervention centers the outlines of a social-ecological research approach are developed. It is suggested that this approach is more suitable to take into account the role of the network of mental health services. The data come from a research project which was designed to explain the historical and social aspects of the process of integration of a crisis intervention service. The results indicate that on the one hand the practice of the service strongly depends on what other services do and on the other hand influences them. The social integration of an institution into the network of other services is discussed as an alternative criterion of evaluation.","2326":"Ecstasy is the term of MDMA, which is spread most of all in the techno scene. Wellknown for centuries as an agent of the nutmeg, MDMA was discovered as a drug during the last decades. Origin, physical and psychical effects and the results of chronicle abuse are described. Consume of XTC as a typical drug abuse of the techno scene represents a new challenge for the classical drug aid system. There are only few points of contact with the heroin scene.","2327":"Data from a survey distributed to all directors of psychiatric hospitals in Germany (n = 286) were used to examine sex differences in rank attainment among psychiatrists. Furthermore the directors were asked to assess differences between male and female psychiatrists concerning their professional activities. A total of 207 directors responded, 10 of them were female. In the rank of assistant doctors male psychiatrists predominated only at the university departments (61%). The position of a registrar was held mainly by male doctors in all types of hospitals: 78% at the university departments, 64% at psychiatric hospitals and 56% at psychiatric departments at general hospitals. 43.9% of the responders assessed women less interested in a professional career than men, 46.5% thought that women are more interested in treatment than in research activities, 43.5% admitted that in case of female applicants their private situation (family, children) is more important for the decision to give a job than in case of male ones. 87% of the directors found that a higher number of women within their teams is very important for a good work climate.","2328":"","2329":"","2330":"","2331":"","2332":"","2333":"","2334":"","2335":"","2336":"The case of a 32-year old man suffering from a 10-year course of schizophrenia is presented.

SSRI inhibit different subsystems of cytochrome-P 450-oxydase. Especially during co-administration of SSRI with antipsychotic and antiarrhythmic drugs pharmacokinetic interactions have to be observed carefully. In this presentation a case of bradycardia after co-administration of paroxetine and metoprolol is reported. Drug history and a careful drug monitoring are necessary requirements to avoid serious adverse effects.","2338":"Relapse and recurrence are common following successful short-term treatment of unipolar depression. Evidence from a number of controlled double-blind investigations indicates that a patient with a history of depressive episodes is best protected against future episodes by being maintained on the same antidepressant agent at the same dose that was used to treat the acute episode. Newer agents, such as paroxetine, sertraline, and fluoxetine, have been studied in controlled manner for up to one year. The effectiveness of the SSRI in preventing recurrence of depression has been well established in six investigations.","2339":"The paper reports on the recruitment of a multicenter study on ambulant prophylactic treatment of schizophrenic disorders. For a study of the relapse-preventative effect of different dose patterns of Flupentixol, a screening phase was carried out among of 1129 schizophrenic patients. The aim of the screening phase was to establish the criteria for exclusion or inclusion in the treatment phase of the study. Only 62 patients could be included. The reason for 54 patients not being included was a lack of compliance from either the patient or the clinician. The meaning of patient- and therapist-compliance in carrying out a multicenter study is also discussed. ","2340":null,"2341":"Therapy outcome is an important criterium for quality assurance. In this study, clinical social workers themselves estimated the outcome of their interventions in 2643 admissions of 2038 patients to a psychiatric hospital. These inpatients had been referred by a psychiatrist to the social worker and comprised 27 % of all patients admitted to the hospital within 11 years. The study purpose was to investigate how the outcome estimates relate to clinical and sociodemographic variables of the patients, to their specific problems, and to the applied interventions. The fewer areas of problems were perceived and the more interventions were performed, the more positive these interventions were evaluated. Administrative interventions were seen as more successful than counseling. Outcome estimates were particularly positive in long and intensive therapies.","2342":"Improved treatment measures of schizophrenic inpatients often lead to early discharge and thus, may be stressful for the relatives. Different styles of coping with this new situation may sometimes be followed by depression and resignation in the relatives. This may have negative effects on the course of the illness. Family group-therapy may be a way to help them. We will give an overview of the different forms of family\/relative-groups and finally present our own concept.","2343":"Instruments allowing to give a psychiatric expertise on the ability of demented people to give a will are needed. Criteria for an estimation of the course of dementing illnesses and for an increased suggestibility in coming to a decision are critically reviewed.","2344":"The basic assumptions of reform psychiatry aim at the establishment of a benign, i.e. peaceful therapeutic regime which promotes the experience of meaningful interpersonal relationships. Yet purpose and therapeutic reality often show discrepancies. The peaceful dialogue is jeopardized by the psychiatric disorder itself, furthermore by the chimera of peacefulness which prevents \"gentle psychiatry\" from recognizing its own strategies of stigmatization and expulsion. Ideologies which take for granted free decision making even for those who are restricted by their illness tend to give legitimation for the withdrawal of necessary help. Especially dangerous patients are at risk of being expelled by a \"gentle psychiatry\" which intends to preserve the professional identity of goodness for the therapist.","2345":"","2346":"","2347":"","2348":"","2349":"","2350":"","2351":"","2352":"This paper reports on a patient suffering from panic-attacks.

The differential diagnosis of panic disorder and epileptic panic attacks is discussed.","2353":"The German psychiatric care system focuses on the person of the patient and on the treatment in which he or she lives. Basing on this principle, the advantages of integrating the inpatient department of a general hospital or a psychiatric hospital into the level of a single sector (a single-stage care system within the community framework) are described, where the sector includes disturbing groups, in the various stages of the course a psychiatric disease takes in a patient. Fundamentally, patients suffering from severe chronic psychosis should also be included in this mode of treatment. In some cases it is still unavoidable to hospitalize such patients in a psychiatric hospital until appropriate facilities have been developed within a framework of the community, especially with regard to adequate complementary facilities. Taking into consideration the human and scientific interpretation of disease, an overall picture is visualised in respect of community-centered concentration of inpatient, day-patient and complementary care on the one hand, and centralised forms or care involving a hospital or psychiatric institutions on the other.","2354":"All german psychiatric clinics were asked to their mental health care of gerontopsychiatric outpatients. Most outpatients must come to be clinic, by this patients with dementia are disadvantaged. Gerontopsychiatric treatment at home or in old-age asylums are rare. Consultations of relatives, supervising of other institutions, gerontopsychiatric centers must be developed.","2355":"A 6-year follow-up study of unipolar depressive inpatients shows a high percentage of 26% of patients with a chronic course. The chronic patients have significant longer phases of depression in the history of their illness or in the index episode and a longer hospitalisation in the index episode. Patients with chronic course have although more often a first episode before the age of 25 years, were less suicidal by admission to hospital and show less improvement from admission to discharge. The study shows, that although not all aspects of the clinical course are related with chronicity, the duration of depressive phases is a good predictor for a chronic course.","2356":"The ward atmosphere is an imposant aspect of the clinical treatment.

The process of change in psychiatry, the work of the Aids-centres and the international discussion about harm reduction have been taken into account in Germany more and more in the face of growing problems in the field of drug aid and increasing poverty among drug addicts. Harm reduction is orientated on the real problems and resources of drug addicts. The historical background and the future demands of harm reduction are discussed.","2360":"","2361":"","2362":"","2363":"","2364":"","2365":"","2366":"Since 1991 in Austria a new law regulates involuntary admission at psychiatric hospitals and any other restriction of patient's freedom. Within 4 days a judge has to decide about further involuntary treatment. A new profession was established for involuntary patients support--the patients advocat. After a slow decrease of institutionalization rate in 1991 the number of involuntary admissions went up in 1993. The effects of the law upon psychiatric patients and treatment in psychiatric hospitals are discussed. Most psychiatrists (81%) are dissatisfied with the new legal situation because they see negative effects for some patients and have to spend a lot of time for juridical matters.","2367":"Initial findings of panic disorder as an independent risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior could not be replicated in studies with psychiatric patients. Instead, it was concluded that panic and anxiety disorders are risk factors when they co-occur with a primary mood disorder. In the present study, the effect of diagnostic comorbidity on rates of suicidality is analyzed on depressive inpatients treated at special depression wards. In a prospective follow-up study, suicidality and anxiety were assessed by means of a modified German version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS). Patients with the symptom of panic attacks showed significantly elevated lifetime prevalence rates of suicidality in comparison with patients who did not report this additional symptom. For the follow-up period, however, there were no significant differences between these two groups. According to these results, the group of depressives with additional panic attacks is not more at risk for suicidal behavior, after being treated in an adequate manner.","2368":"","2369":"This paper reports about first preliminary results of an investigation by DGPPN regarding group therapeutic work in psychiatric inpatient settings throughout the Federal Republic of Germany. The DGPPN sub-section \"Group Therapy in Psychiatry\" was set up by starting with this pilot study using a preliminary version of a questionnaire which is currently under revision for future investigations. This paper also deals with a brief historical survey of the origins of group work and group therapy in institutions. In regards to the installation of the new domain of a \"Physician for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy\" it is intended to theoretically consolidate group therapy in psychiatric facilities. The \"Interpersonal Model\" of Sullivan is being highlighted as a useful theory towards an integration of various theoretical perspectives such as biological, individual, interpersonal, and sociological ones. This integration is being stressed for education\/ training and treatment aspects in psychiatry and psychotherapy as well.","2370":"The following article is informing about the experiences from a psychosocial project on Huntington's Disease (HD), a neuropsychiatric disorder with dominant inheritance. The project was running from July 1987 to October 1992 and was funded by the Robert-Bosch-Stiftung. During this project the authors contacted 78 involved families (131 persons), they offered psychotherapies, family-therapies, as well as meetings for patients and explored the subject by semi-structured interviews. The results of this project are presented in the following part.","2371":"Huntington's Disease, a neuropsychiatric disorder with dominant inheritance and late manifestation is related to multiple psychosocial problems of the affected person, his life partner as well as their children (so-called individuals at risk). During a five years project the authors contacted 131 persons, directly and indirectly involved in problems with H.D. In the first part the authors present after a general survey sociodemographic and clinical data of the project.","2372":"The neuroleptic threshold theory raised the expectation that schizophrenic patients could be treated with an optimal, individual neuroleptic dosage, causing no side effects. Although most existing studies do not fulfill current methodological standards, a few methodologically convincing analyses confirm that good clinical results can be achieved with relatively low dosages (4 mg haloperidol equivalent per day). Thus, the neuroleptic threshold theory and methods related to it deserve further research.","2373":"","2374":"","2375":"","2376":"","2377":"Part I of this article has described Pinels carrier upto the 1790ies. This second part concentrates of the actual events and the general historical backgrounds of the so-called \"chain liberation.\" This--in our opinion--cannot be regarded as one singular act, but as symbol for a complex and multistage process. The very common conception of a selective act of \"chain liberation\" is very simplified and influenced by the \"myth of Pinel, \" built by the 19th century psychiatrists and historians. Nevertheless: a scientifically sophisticated biography founded on archives material is yet expected.","2378":"A 42 year old drug addict reported on his experiences with intravenous application of scandicaine and lidocaine.

Occupational situation of the former clients at follow-up was as follows: 24% were competitively employed, 17% held a sheltered working place, 3% underwent training, 6% did not-economic work, 6% worked in a household. 13% were unemployed and in search for a job, 30% received a disability pension. 41% of all clients had held no job at all since termination of the ATZ.","2381":"The rate of rehospitalisation of schizophrenic psychoses may attain 70% within 3 years, for juvenile schizophrenics up to 80%. Psychoeducative counseling for the reduction of High Expressed Emotions (HEE) of the relatives of the patients shall be able to reduce the rate of rehospitalisation below 20%. But it seems, that HEE in relatives of young schizophrenics (ICD-9:295.x, DSM-III-R:295.xx) with short duration of illness is different from HEE in unselected samples of adult patients. Diagnostic, therapy and experiences in counseling 8 families with a schizophrenic child for a period of 3 years are described. HEE in relatives of young schizophrenics seems to be different to HEE in relatives of unselected samples. Finally changing and extension to the current forms of treatment for juvenile schizophrenics and there families will be discussed.","2382":"Catatonic patients are often not able to communicate their subjective experiences behind their \"fassade of immobility.\" Therefore was retrospectively (3 weeks later) investigated subjective experiences in 24 catatonic patients with a self-assessment-scale especially for catatonia developed by us. Our results showed that catatonic patients subjectively experience less their altered movements but rather cognitive, i.e. ambivalence, or affective, i.e. intense emotions which couldn't be controlled, alterations. According to our results we were able to distinguish an emotive (intense anxiety) from a non-emotive, i.e. cognitive (predominating ambivalence), subtype in catatonia with regard to subjective experience.","2383":"Modern theories on hysteria are presented by describing the historical context of various scientific approach to hysterical phenomena as well as the concepts of dissociation and conversion which are closely linked. The subdivision of the classical hysterical neurosis into the dissociative disorders and the somatoform disorders within the diagnostic classifications of ICD-10 and DSM-III-R respectively DSM-IV is illustrated and discussed. These new theories have prompted the development of some instruments such as diagnostic interviews (SCID-D) and self-measuring questionnaires (DES). The scientific value and importance of these instruments is discussed, especially with regard to further studies on dissociative disorders, particularly in the German-speaking countries.","2384":null,"2385":"","2386":"","2387":"","2388":"","2389":"","2390":"","2391":"","2392":"","2393":"","2394":"","2395":"","2396":"Based on german authors literature this contribution describes important features of facticious disorders.

His \"chain liberation\" of the insane is in this context often seen as breakbrough to an human conception of psychiatry. This article describes in two parts the historical backgrounds of Pinels activities and analyses the discipline-genetic myths connected with them.

Overall the core group of psychiatric professionals-psychiatrists, psychologists and nurses-had the worst rating, while non-core professionals like occupational therapists, social workers and ambulance aids received the highest satisfaction ratings. One possible explanation for the dissatisfaction with the core psychiatric professionals is the unmet needs of the relatives for information, which 93% complained of. It is suggested to teach professionals systematically how to evaluate the needs of relatives and how to communicate with them in a more satisfying way.","2399":"Open or hidden violence tends to be ubiquitous in the psychiatric hospital. It causes tensions, anxiousness, burnout, and much human suffering. Especially exposed are psychiatric nurses. In the present paper observations and experiences with violence are presented: dealing with disruptive patients needs intensive and periodical training although violence should not be accepted as a common daily phenomenon. Over-stimulation by crowded wards and noise, but also lack of occupation are important triggers. Victims should be given solidarity by peers and superiours, whereas analyses of the events tend to cause further trauma. Finally it should be kept in mind that victims often suffer from posttraumatic stress disorders.","2400":"Based on the standardized data of 2643 treatment episodes documented over 11 years in a psychiatric hospital, this study investigates the issues, activities, and outcome of social work with 2038 psychiatric inpatients from the perspective of quality assurance. A primary objective was to study how the social workers' interventions relate to the patients' problems also with regard to sociodemographic characteristics and type of disorder of the patient. The social workers' estimation of the outcome was also studied in relation to these variables. Interventions were found to correspond significantly with problems, and were mostly depending on age, sex, and diagnosis. Impaired social functioning, predominantly present in chronic disorders, was the major concern of social work interventions.","2401":"The Berlin Deinstitutionalization Study investigates effects of the planned reduction of psychiatric hospital beds in Berlin prospectively. In the beginning cross-sectional survey all adult psychiatric patients from two and a half districts, who had been hospitalized for more than 6 months, were examined. The total sample was 422 patients. Treatment situation and needs for nursing care are reported. The primary diagnosis according to ICD-10 was organic disorder (incl. Korsakov's syndrome) in 70 patients and mental retardation in 61. Psychopathology and social disabilities were examined in 237 of the remaining 291 patients. On average, psychopathology and disabilities were moderate. A cluster analysis classified three groups. When patients should be discharged, special protective measures might be necessary only for the two smaller groups (together 31%).","2402":"In this study length of stay and costs per case were examined in three different types of psychiatric hospitals: Psychiatric departments in general hospitals and psychiatric hospitals each liable to provide in-patient care for a defined catchment area, and psychiatric departments in general hospitals without such liability. Data basis were all hospital treated cases in Berlin West that are covered by general insurance. Length of stay and costs differed significantly depending on the type of psychiatric hospital as well as on diagnoses, way of referral and age of patients. Psychiatric departments with catchment area have the shortest length of stay and lowest costs per case. This is independent of age, gender, way of referral and diagnosis of the patients. Influence of each factor is quantified.","2403":"Departments of Psychiatry in Germany were approached by direct investigations via a questionnaire regarding various parameters of structure and performance during 1993, since only insufficient administrative data on the structure of inpatient care were available. An expert inquiry that had been officially conducted in Germany in 1975 had recommended for 200 beds for inpatient accommodation. The present investigation, however, revealed that the average number of beds was only 80 in almost all hospitals. The majority of the Departments approached were engaged in 100% patient care, so that the discussion regarding two classes of psychiatry in respect of impatient nursing care is now obsolete. There is also no significant difference between the Departments of Psychiatry in hospitals in the pre-reunification West German and East German areas, the only exception being the sizes and hence the capacities of the relevant departments.","2404":"","2405":"","2406":"","2407":"","2408":"A case study illustrates that even after discontinuation fluoxetine still increases amtitriptyline plasma-levels.

Neuropsychiatrists treated less children and adolescents with psychiatric symptoms than pediatricians or general practitioners. Approximately 50% of the patients with psychiatric symptoms received psychopharmaca. The most frequently prescribed psychopharmaca were neuroleptics and antidepressants, followed by phytopharmaca with various ingredients, which were most frequently prescribed by general practitioners. The average duration of a psychopharmacotherapy was 9 weeks. A great deal of uncertainty regarding the prescription of psychopharmaca to children and adolescents has become evident. Despite the fact that an enuresis can not be diagnosed before the end of the 5th year, it was one of the most frequently treated symptom of the 2-5 year old children. On the other hand, approximately one third of all physicians principally do not treat children and adolescents with psychopharmaca.","2413":"Clinical records of all patients treated from 1983 to 1991 in a university clinic for lang-term-use of benzodiazepines were examined. Daily intake of benzodiazepines began in 80% immediately after the first prescription. At the time of admission, 34% reported intake of more than 3 DDD, i.e. more than 30 mg of diazepam. In patients 70%, additional abuse of alcohol and\/or other psychotropic substances was established. Benzodiazepines were the first substances abused in 49%. The diagnosis of abuse or dependency was made in 65% before admission. Symptoms of organic brain syndrome were described in 30% of all records. Symptom leading to first benzodiazepine intake were somatic complaints (40%), depressed mood (39%), insomnia (37% and anxiety (24%). Between first intake and admission, there was a significant increase in patients with somatic complaints, depressed mood and anxiety. After detocification, symptoms leading to admission improved in 80% of all patients.","2414":"Since the extent of medication noncompliance in schizophrenic patients ranges between 50 and 60%, evaluation of factors that are associated with noncompliance has become an important issue. 197 schizophrenic patients have been interviewed with regard to numerous issues: Form and type of medication; information about side effects; attitude of patients towards illness and medication. Our data suggest that information about benefits and side effects, as well as the attitude of patients towards illness and medication play an important role in the adherence to the treatment regimen.","2415":"Excessive smoking is a well know phenomenon in psychiatry. Nicotine, the most important content of cigarette tobacco, interacts with several receptors of neurotransmitters in the CNS: especially the dopaminergic system appears to be relevant in this respect. Nicotine is a potent substance to counteract neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. On the other hand nicotine is possibly a risk-factor for tardive dyskinesia. Nicotine has enormous therapeutical implications.","2416":"","2417":"","2418":"We report th case of a 45-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital for a treatment of analgetic substance abuse. Surprisingly she reported after some time that she had been hearing imperative and commenting voices for 12 years. We discuss the importance of negative symptoms for the diagnosis of schizophrenia.","2419":"Inspite of the inherent potential, the computer-based medical record is underutilized today, although the use of computers in medicine and psychiatry is widespread. Lack of information is one of the reasons why physicians have resisted the introduction of information systems in medical practice beyond auxiliary services. The author describes the functions of a clinical information system currently in use in a psychiatric inpatient hospital, offering an electronic medical record, office automation tools, knowledge databases and individual PC-programs. He discusses measures to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the electronic data and shortterm experiences concerning benefits and risks of the system.","2420":"A modified version of the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAFS-M) which is proposed as axis V for DSM-IV by Goldman et al. (1992), was analyzed in a consecutive series of 266 psychiatric patients. Scores were clearly dependent on ICD-10 diagnosis and on other psychiatric variables. The scale was almost independent on self-rating in relevant psychopathological dimensions. Altogether, the results favour the view that the modified version of the GAFS is an economic and sufficient instrument for assessing adaptive functioning in psychiatric patients.","2421":"By means of case studies and experiences in supervising multiprofessional teams in psychiatric wards it is pointed out that the institutional frame of psychiatry is dynamically connected with the intrapsychic conflicts of the psychotic patients and their interpersonal defence. The understanding of the teammembers' countertransference prevents collusive patterns of relationship. This symbolizing process which is permanently endangered by the psychotic splitting mechanisms of the patients as well as by the institutional defence contributes to develop a \"common language\" in the multiprofessional teams. Furthermore psychoanalytic supervision enables the multiprofessional staff to understand the intrapsychic and the interactional dimension of the behaviour of the psychotic patient and to maintain their empathy even under difficult conditions.","2422":"A considerable number of schizophrenic persons also abuse illegal drugs. This comorbidity raises problems of diagnosis which become particularly important when concerning forensic questions. The hypothesis of a distinct psychopathological syndrome of drug induced psychosis is widely criticized in the literature. A case report is presented to demonstrate the problems of differential diagnoses and the difficulties for psychiatric expertizing arising from these problems.","2423":"The authors report their three years experience with treating addicts (both alcoholics and users of prescription and illegal drugs) in a specialized unit employing a low-threshold admission policy. Difficulties as well as advantages of the concept are discussed. For the common treatment of patients addicted to different groups of substances on the same ward to be successful certain prerequisites probably have to be met: A clearly structured daily routine respectively therapy-program and close professional cooperation within a multifunctional therapeutic team harbouring a basic attitude of acceptance towards their patients.","2424":"During the course of the disease many alcoholic patients are detoxified on an inpatient basis. Detoxification lasts for some days to 2 or 3 weeks. The treatment goal of abstinence usually cannot be achieved by detoxification alone. Therefore a qualified detoxification should consist of a medical treatment, a careful (psychiatric) diagnostic process and a psychotherapeutic treatment aiming at motivation for further treatment. The described program integrates these components. The psychotherapeutic approach is emphatic and directive, trying to convince all patients to apply for further alcoholism treatment. Follow-up data of 120 of the initial 130 patients eight months after detoxification showed, that 68 patients (57%) started further treatment, most of them as inpatients. In the group of prognostic unfavourable patients, who had not received any disease related counseling before detoxification (77% of the sample), 47% started further alcoholism treatment.","2425":"Motivational work is secondary preventive work. The aim is to increase activity for maintaining long-term abstinence. The principles and structure of a secondary preventive program with several opportunities of intervention in the frame of detoxification treatment are presented.","2426":"The controversy caused by the debate on treatment and substitution strategies in drug addiction is unchanged. This is particularly true concerning the use of codein-based drugs in the substitution of heroin abusers. However, only a few studies on the effects of this old and widely used method of substitution have been carried out. This article presents one retrospective and prospective study on the effects of the codein-based substitution in heroin abusers (n = 416). With respect to the issues addressed by this study such as somatic and psychic health, social integration, delinquincy and consumption patterns, patients as well as clinicians report an improvement in general health and fewer of the problems usually associated with heroin abuse, similar to the results from substitution treatment elsewhere.","2427":"","2428":"The term \"Social Psychiatry\" was first used in English in 1917 by E. E. Southard. Six years before, in 1911 Max Fischer, director of Wiesloch Mental Hospital near Heidelberg employed the terms \"Sozialpsychiatrie\" and \"Soziale Psychiatrie\" in German.","2429":"In a 75 years-old patient with chronic senile depression criteria of zolpidem dependency were fulfilled. There was no history of benzodiazepine or alcohol abuse. Positive psychotropic effects were emphasized by the patient who spread intake over the day.","2430":"According to the newer literature on folate deficiencies in depressive patients serum folate and vitamin B12 levels were studied (RIA) in 121 consecutively admitted depressive inpatients (47 male, 74 female depressives; age 17-86 years, mean age 48 years, diagnostic by ICD-9 300.4, 296.1) during the first (1-3) days of admission (normal volumes folate 3-17 ng\/ml, vitamin B12 200-900 pg\/ml). Only in two patients serum folate below 3 ng\/ml were found, low vitamin B12 levels (below 200 pg\/ml) showed 14 patients. This result is in contrast to other authors who found folate deficiencies in 10-50% of psychiatric patients.","2431":"Acute hyperthyroidism is known to be a cause of psychopathologic and especially anxiety syndromes. A review of the literature will be given. Nonreversible psychopathologic changes in an euthyroid state after hyperthyroidism are also described. Correlations between T4-concentration and neuropsychologic and electroencephalographic findings were reported. CT findings of the brain are not mentioned. A case report should help to discuss nonreversible changes after hyperthyroidism and cranial CT findings.","2432":"","2433":"The question was investigated whether during the time of building up a psychiatric department in a General Hospital the situation changes in the Mental Hospital already in evident points e.g. the rate of compulsory admissions. Two years were compared: 1984 the year before the psychiatric department was established and 1988 the year with half of the number of planned beds built up in the psychiatric department. The number of admissions to the Mental Hospital was cut in half. The total sum of compulsory admissions to the Mental Hospital as well as to the psychiatric department was reduced from 255 (1984) to 148 (1988). Already in this time of building up the psychiatric department the compulsory admitted, the gerontopsychiatric patients and the foreigners were over proportional represented among the patients in the department compared to the Mental Hospital. The often presumed selection did not take place.","2434":"24 mentally ill patients were interviewed about social networks and social support systems. The number of network members was 25.7 persons on average, most of them were other mentally ill people themselves (34%) or health professionals (20%). Contacts between mentally ill people were characterised by sympathy for each other, short lasting relationship and little support function. Health professionals have quite different functions for our patients depending on their professional role. Emotional support (which is seen as the most important support function by our patients) is given mainly by psychologists and social workers. Very little support comes from psychiatrists and general practitioners.","2435":"Evaluation of psychiatric care is an important task in research and in routine conditions. It requires definition of criteria. Subjective criteria are, for different reasons, of increasing interest. Subjective quality of life, subjective needs for help and support and patients' assessment of psychiatric treatment are regarded as particularly relevant criteria. We present and briefly discuss instruments for assessment of these criteria, that are new at least in the German language. Results of a first cross-sectional study in a community care setting are reported. Regarding quality of life healthy groups were examined too. The findings suggest that the instruments are usefully applicable and that they may produce plausible results.","2436":"The needs of insufficiently treated Turkish patients motivated to offer a group-psychotherapy in cooperation with an interpreter. Only on a trickful way his expenses could be paid by the health insurance. While the plan for such a group was made, it was estimated just as a second-rate escape for such patients. But already during the course of the first group-session a therapeutic concept developed which overcame barriers of language and culture. So this experiment turned out to be an important step for developing suitable therapeutic structures for migrants.","2437":"","2438":"In a critical review of the theoretical background and recent empirical results of quality of life research in psychiatry the problems of a onesided quantitative methodological orientation will be discussed. For the surmounting of the theoretical difficulties a dynamic model of subjective quality of life in psychiatry will be presented and according to this model the necessity of a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods will be suggested.","2439":"History and perspectives of qualitative research are presented together with an overview of the major methods in their application in the field of social psychiatry. Methods for analyzing subjective points of view (various forms of interviews), for describing everyday life and routines of actions in and outside of institutions (participant observation, conversation analysis), and for interpreting in-depth-structures (objective hermeneutics, theoretical coding) are discussed. Triangulation of different methods, strategies for assessing interpretations, and findings and processual evaluation of qualitative research are outlined as perspectives.","2440":"","2441":"A major reason for the patients' increasing drug abuse is inactivity and tediousness. The psychiatric hospital reacts primarily with repression but then tries more constructive measures: a special room, a sort of bar and disco for young people is created allowing all sorts of leisure activities and informal meetings. The target population of young patients is successfully engaged, they help rising the \"WonderBar\" which seems to gain some importance to them, and in the hospital, the paralysing feelings of helplessness in front of the drug problems disappear.","2442":"Patients of the Department of Psychiatry of the Municipal Hospital Centre in Duisburg-Rheinhausen, Germany, are offered work therapy mainly by the nearby Sociopsychiatric Centre \"Cuckoo's Nest\". The possibilities of working and establishing contacts are described in detail after a brief review of the development and the advantage of shifting work therapy to an external, non-clinical site. Finally, the question is discussed whether the areas \"work\" and \"leisure time\" complement or substitute each other.","2443":"The perspective of users of psychiatric services has mostly been studied by professional researchers. In this study a group of users investigated subjective quality of life, assessment of psychiatric treatment and needs of other users. A special questionnaire was constructed and used. Psychiatric institutions were assessed as being on average good to satisfactory; satisfaction with different life domains was fairly good; needs for support varied very much.","2444":"Before admission to in-patient psychotherapeutic treatment 202 patients with schizophrenic or neurotic orders, partly with secondary alcohol or substance addiction, were investigated with a questionnaire concerning patients' expectations of psychotherapy: targets, expectations of therapeutic attitude and technique as well as therapeutic procedure (individuals or group therapy). The results are correlated with sociodemographic data and psychiatric disorders and compared with the patients who were not admitted to therapy and the results after discharge. Conclusions are made with regard to indication and adaptive patient-centered therapeutic proceeding.","2445":"Computer programs to aid qualitative research are offered in increasing numbers. Most programs provide basic features like the decomposition of large bodies of text, labelling of text units by category names, retrieval and search for key words. More advanced features are graphical displays of the categories, secondary texts, statistical output and a multi-user interface. The benefits and dangers of these programs for the process of doing qualitative research are discussed.","2446":"Qualitative research methods give an opportunity to investigate the everyday reality of dealing with and understanding of chronic mental illness as a social reality in local context. By the reconstruction of the perspective of the mentally ill, their relatives and their professional caregivers we analyze the cultural and social side of chronicity. This approach is illustrated by a still running study in which we compare the situation of chronic mental patients in an east- and west-district of Berlin after the fall of the wall. The research method and the steps of generalization of results are demonstrated by an case example.","2447":"","2448":"Intoxication by medication containing bromid has become so rare in recent years, that the clinical syndrome is nearly forgotten. The revival of brom in neurology at present points to an increased rate of bromintoxications. With this background and a corresponding case-history the symptoms and therapy of bromintoxication is represented.","2449":"Based on five case studies, the suggestion is that, if physiological myoclonus can be excluded, antidepressant - or neuroleptic-induced myoclonus must as a rule be presumed to be a most subtle indication of increased cerebral exitability, an epileptic fragment or, in some instances, a myoclonus epilepsy. In each of the reported cases EEG recordings reflected epilepsy-specific potentials. Whether, however, the scope of differences in the EEG recordings and the N1\/P1 amplitude increase of the SSEP may be used as an additional diagnostic criterion to determine the risk of epileptic seizures, should depend on the type of myoclonus chiefly induced. This would require more extensive neurophysiological examinations which should mainly include the back-averaging to permit, beside the EEG, a better evaluation of the relatively easily obtainable SSEP findings.","2450":"In the present report the authors reach the conclusion that concerning the pathological picture no essential alterations can be observed. Patients, however, presently often enter therapy in a worse condition than before. Thus the tendency to arrive at a chronic stadium increases. In our opinion this development is partly owing to the fact, that the continuity of treatment is interrupted and partly to changes concerning the framework of conditions of live in society. We regard it as our task, also with the modified conditions of life, to render possible the dialogue between all participating in the treatment. Our purpose and wish remain to put all our available abilities to the disposition of the patients.","2451":"We evaluated the expectations and experience of 34 participants from a caregivers' support group. In comparison with the husbands, the wives of demented patients attended more regularly and for a longer period of time. Wives expected and experienced emotional support, whereas husbands were more interested in obtaining information about the medical causes of dementia and about patient management. Wives and daughters admitted to greater emotional and physical distress. The role and efficiency of caregivers' support groups should be studied prospectively, particularly because dementia-related problems posed on individual families on one hand and on the public health sector on the other are expected to increase during the next decades.","2452":"In the light of progress in psychiatric therapy the problem of treatment-resistance deserves increasing attention. One of the most important challenges in modern psychiatry is to further reduce treatment failure. In so-called treatment-resistant depression various strategies are recommended. In the present paper a regimen is described that only little attention is paid to: Subliminal induced-hypoglycemia (insulin therapy), that coursed amelioration in about 3\/4 of the patients.","2453":"Since community mental health care started public attitudes towards mentally ill and mental health care had been development to an important influencing factor in planning mental health care and in rehabilitation of patients. This paper describes the historical development of research in public attitudes in psychiatry, which started with deinstitutionalization. It discusses the interaction between types and quality of mental health care and public opinions or attitudes towards the care of mentally ill patients, considering own empirical results.","2454":"Contrary to the procedure followed in German-speaking countries, British national health policy since the fifties has been to promote and actively effect the closure and winding up of large psychiatric hospital centres in favour of alternative structures. The present article presents a preliminary balance sheet on 39 hospitals that have been closed since 1961 to the present day in the course of this shift-in-emphasis policy.","2455":"The TAPS study evaluates the closure of two Greater London mental hospitals. Beginning in 1985, one-year and five-year follow-up compared successive cohorts of long-stay patients discharged to the community (leavers) with groups of matched long-stay patients who stayed in hospital. Some psychopathological symptoms improved in discharged patients, some did not. Mortality, patient vagrancy and delinquent behaviour did not increase in leavers. Patient autonomy, social networks and patient satisfaction favoured out-patient provision of care as compared to continuing in-patient care.","2456":"","2457":"Depressive disorder and cardiovascular diseases occur quite frequently together in the same patient, especially in older patients. On the one hand depressions can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, on the other hand cardiac disease can lead to depressive disorders in need of treatment. Thus the problem of prescribing tricyclics for patients with cardiovascular diseases is of great clinical relevance. In our review we summarize first of all the important cardiovascular effects of tricyclics in healthy persons and patients with cardiovascular diseases. Indications and (relative) contraindications for this medication with respect to cardiovascular disorders and proposals for diagnostic procedures in the beginning and during the course of antidepressant medication are following. Finally we present some recommendations for the treatment of tricyclic-induced side effects.","2458":"","2459":"","2460":"Psychiatric disorders following treatment with Mefloquine were described several times since the introduction of this antimalarial drug in Germany in 1985. On the basis of two case reports problems of the diagnosis and of the correlation of psychiatric disorders with the medication are discussed. Particularly are an analysis of the development of the ADR and a comparison of the psychiatric symptoms with known ADR-cases and with other psychiatric diseases important. This seems to be significant for an optimal treatment as well as for the assessment of the prognosis.","2461":"The subject of how to treat patients suffering from severe panic attacks and concomitant symptoms has in the past been insufficiently discussed although these patients typify a legitimate clinical group. This case report deals with a patient with a long history of panic disturbances including agoraphobia, social phobia, depressive moods and alcohol abuse, whose condition remitted only after applying a supplementary treatment, using Imipramine and Moclobimide in conjunction with behavioural therapy. Criteria of panic disturbances not yielding to treatment and potential therapeutic measures are being discussed.","2462":"Starting with Ciompis model of \"affect logic\" I want to show that affective, cognitive and behavioral patterns, once emerged in psychosis, subsequently tend to repetition and chronification on account of psychological, social but also neuronal plasticity. In the discussion about reasons of the chronification process, negative symptoms become more and more relevant. Beside the primary negative symptoms, patients develop coping strategies to avoid a new relapse. These secondary negative symptoms, however, should not only be understood as an adaptation effort of internal \"disturbing factors\", but also of external ones, caused by the surroundings. Therefore, the patient's behavior should not be seen detached from his context. To see negative symptoms also as coping strategy has major therapeutical implications for community psychiatry, because of the involved option that negative symptoms can be replaced by more curative and less disabling behaviour, i.e. they are accessible to therapeutical efforts. That means for community psychiatry, however, to develop itself out of its deficit oriented treatment paradigm and to increase its therapeutical ambitions.","2463":"Based on data acquired during first weekend leave of schizophrenic in-patients, variables are identified related to high emotional strain for patients (n = 78) and family members (n = 121). This attempt is successful only when examining data for mothers and fathers separately. Mothers feel more emotional pressure when patients lie in bed for prolonged periods, and develop increasing feelings of guilt the more obviously patients are socially handicapped in daily life. Fathers, however, significantly react to the length of time patients spend at home. For both parents correlations are found between emotional stress and critical, hostile attitudes toward the patient (measured by the Camberwell Family Interview); none with emotional over-involvement.","2464":"The sexual abuse of children represents a remarkable proportion of about 25% of all sexual offences. Data from 20 male pedophilic persons seen at the occasion of forensic psychiatric assessment were analysed. Personality traits as measured by the widely used standardized personality inventar FPI version A1 were dominated by signs of psychic inhibition and altered somatic wellness. Intelligence and education level were usually low. Nine persons (45%) had been already convicted because of the sexual abuse of children aged below 14 years. In stepwise multiple regression analysis including age, educational and social level, tested IQ and the different personality traits (FPI-A1 scales), the number of previous offences was shown to be significantly influenced by the (younger) age of the culprit at the occasion of the sexual child abuse and tendentially also be the (lower) educational level.","2465":"The contribution resumes the most important empirical results on the phenomenon of alcoholic relapse during inpatient-treatment. Results and clinical considerations lead to the opinion to abandon the classic position of disciplinary discharge after inpatient relapse without deviating from the ideal target of abstinence. Proposals are made for the practical management of relapses during inpatient-treatment. Finally, it is demanded for empirical studies on this taboo field of addiction treatment for deciding the questions of continued treatment or discharge after inpatient alcoholic relapse.","2466":"Aggressive behaviour in epileptics may have many causes which are connected more or less closely with epilepsy. Ictal aggression is very rare. In the case of a patient with complex partial seizures and a schizophrenia-like psychosis different forms of generation of aggressive behaviour are discussed.","2467":"Grawe, Donati and Bernauer conducted together with 16 female and male coworkers the first comprehensive meta-analysis of all the psychotherapeutic studies that were available. They examined and evaluated each of a total of 897 studies according to 1000 individual parameters. Even before publication, everyone concerned took sides, turning the book into a political affair: behavioural therapists versus female psychoanalysts, psychologists versus female physicians, female scientists versus followers of a \"school\". Be that as it may, the book by Grawe, Bernauer and Donati yields important results which nobody can deny without harming the very methods it citicises.","2468":"Kufs' disease is a very rare type of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. A case of a 52 year old man with dementia is described. The cause for patient's dementia was the adult type (Kufs' disease) of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. The diagnosis based on the histopathological post mortem-examination of the brain-tissue. A brother of our patient became ill with the same symptoms and at the same age of onset. So we conclude that there is a accumulation in the family.","2469":"The present study reports about social work during a 3 month period in a psychiatric intensive care unit. The activities of the social worker were documented and classified according a special key. 160 patients were admitted and diagnosed according to ICD 9 and ICD 10, in about 62% of these patients the social worker was involved. The analysis demonstrates that the social worker is more active in male patients and in patients with schizophrenic psychosis. This report points out the relevance of the social work in a psychiatric intensive care unit and the necessity of a good documentation of the social work efforts.","2470":"","2471":"In this study an evaluation of 36 medical reports of patients diagnosed as \"Borderline Personality Disorder\" was made. The finding of the diagnosis in clinical routine is discussed. In consideration of the variations of psychopathological states in these patients the authors suggest that there should be put more emphasis on the changes of symptoms in the course of a longer time.","2472":"Transference is an effective protection against suicidal impulses of psychiatric patients. However, suicidal patient's highly ambivalent attempts at establishing a relationship with the therapist lead to significant transference and countertransference problems. During the course of therapy the therapist often is used as a selfobject, an experience that alters the narcissistic equilibrium. Suicidal patients create a selfobject transference by means of attacks on the therapist similar to those they themselves had experienced in their childhoods. The hidden attacks are very troublesome to the therapist's own feeling of selfworth and his state of self may be changed in the sense of a selfobject countertransference.","2473":"The creation in Germany of the professional designation of a joint Specialist for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy raises a number of questions and problems. The risks and chances of the new regulation are discussed by means of six theses. The author favours maximum closeness to practice when performing psychotherapeutic training of psychiatrists so that these may be enabled to execute all the care activities that come up in psychiatry day by day, in a psychodynamically oriented manner. In my opinion, however, cooperation between psychiatry and psychoanalysis can be successful if a coexistence develops that is upheld and animated by the tensions and atmosphere of suspense existing between the two disciplines.","2474":"","2475":"","2476":"","2477":"","2478":"A case of systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE) with development of a delusional depression is presented. Psychiatric symptoms in patients with SLE and in patients treated with glucocorticoids are discussed. The main psychiatric side effects of a therapy with steroids are a dose-dependent, reversible dementia like syndrome and a probably not dose-dependent provocation of psychosis. Furthermore the role of the dysregulation of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in major depression is stressed and consequences for psychopharmacological treatment are emphasized.","2479":"The so-called young adult chronic patients suffer from mental disorders in the motivational and social sphere. Among others, work therapy is one of the methods of the treatment. The agricultural work therapy can supply with a large variety of gradually adapted working facilities. The demanding property of nature improves motivational disorders. Animals and plants as mediators help cure social disorders. Agricultural work therapy can contribute to find ones profession and can have psychotherapeutic effects.","2480":"Kraepelin's main intention was to establish psychiatry as an independent, medically and scientifically oriented specialty. He tried to apply Wilhelm Wundt's complex theoretical system on psychiatric research, thereby simplifying, but not falsifying it. He regarded different kinds of mental illness as natural entities. According to his central hypothesis, all scientific methods will sooner or later arrive at these entities. The new operationalized diagnostic systems like ICD-10 and DSM-III-R stem from logical empiricism: Theoretical assumptions, especially with regard to pathogenesis and etiology, should not influence the diagnostic process. Contrary to Kraepelin, no implicit decision should be made on the fundamental nosological questions (i.e. strictly separated natural disease entities vs. blurred borders or categorical vs. dimensional approach. This comparison shows that Kraepelin, although not too much interested in epistemological issues, can be regarded a convincing example for the necessity to include them in the discussion of psychiatric research.","2481":"A survey was undertaken amongst student nurses at a psychological clinic with the aim of reconstructing the way in which the participants project values and expectations onto the established hierarchy of the institution. The method used for the survey was the Repertory-Grid-Technique; the grids were evaluated in a formal logic way. It can be seen a) how students especially favour the team as a niche at the workplace and how they seek to dissociate it from other role-bearers at the clinic, b) how patients are categorized at the very bottom of the hierarchy of values, c) how in some grids an internalized attitude is reflected as a mountain of constructions formed of idealized work expectations, which later could crop up as \"Burn Out\" Syndrome.","2482":"One of the highest rates of suicide occur in German-speaking countries and particularly in Saxonia. There are grounds for the assumption that the fact has been caused by a careful recording of suicides in this country since 1829. The paper describes the development of rates of suicide and the changes of the suicidal methods in Saxonia during the last one-hundred- and -fifty years with regard to age and sex.","2483":"We conducted a study on alcohol consumption habits in the five therapeutic homes for the mentally ill in Mannheim. Through assessment by their case managers we obtained data from 136 residents. Frequent alcohol use is currently reported in 12.5%. This group of frequent alcohol users is characterized by a higher proportion of men, higher age at entry into the institution and a lower dosage of neuroleptic medication. No significant relation is found with regard to the age at onset of disease, the rehospitalisation rate and the general life satisfaction. Severe problems through alcohol use are seen only isolated but in all clients with an earlier diagnosis of alcohol abuse. According to our results alcohol abuse in therapeutic homes is reported less frequently than in other populations of chronic mentally ill clients. It might be suspected that mentally ill patients with additional alcohol problems are not adequately provided with housing in the complementary care system. Verification is needed whether through the development of specific offers this deficit can be regressed.","2484":"In Germany for a long time mental illness among homeless people didn't occur as an urging problem. Only lately the number of surveys about mental health problems among homeless people is slowly rising (along with a strong increase of homeless people), most of them being cross-sectional among users of local homes, hostels or shelters. The paper gives a short summary of the historical development, describes the services provided for homeless people in Germany and discusses the findings of the studies conducted in Germany during the last years.","2485":"","2486":"Nowadays B. v. Gudden is primary known as psychiatrist of the dream-king Ludwig II.; nevertheless he was not only a doctor of the top people, but one of the great clinicians, neuropathologists and psychiatric teachers in the last third of the 19th century. Trained at Siegburg and Illenau, the leading institutions of german mental hospital psychiatry, he was formed by Conolly's \"no-restraint\"-movement as well as by Griesingers neuropathological concepts. So he became one of the most influential academic teachers of german psychiatry, who attracted important pupils like August Forel or Emil Kraepelin.","2487":"Dementia and social disintegration were the reasons for admittance of a patient to the psychiatric hospital. His disease is described considering the autoptic finding of a olivocerebellar atrophy type Holmes in his mother.","2488":"The example of a 70 year old female patient with endogenous depression and benzodiazepine dependency at the same time shows the problems created by the attempt to attribute the clinical picture to only one singular cause. As in the beginning we were not aware of her benzodiazepine dependency, she underwent withdrawal, so that the clinical picture became very complex and lengthy; it should be considered that long-term benzodiazepine use as well as withdrawal might have contributed to genesis, at least to manifestation of the depressive disorder. Apart from the self-contained depressive disorder and benzodiazepine dependency, obviously biographic-psychodynamic and family-dynamic factors have been important in formation, but as well in remittence of the complex clinical picture. An impressive urinary retention without detectable organic origin which persisted for several weeks is remarkable.","2489":"Starting at a short account of epidemiological, symptomatical and therapeutical aspects of dementia, a group-referential concept for persons suffering from dementia is presented. Aims of treatment, points of view of carrying through and contents of the treatment are described. A summary of experiences up to now and recommendations for the therapeutical dealing with this group of patients follow.","2490":"Restrictive measures are widely used in psychiatric hospitals. But they are ill reputed. Little is known about them. This study is about the administration of isolation of mentally ill patients in a psychiatric hospital. 274 isolations of 100 patients within 11 months are recorded. Isolations concern 5% of the treated patients. That means two isolations on 1000 days of hospitalization. Mostly concerned are patients with schizophrenia or manic episodes. The most frequent reasons given were protection or irritation, danger for the patient or others but also molestation or provocation.","2491":"Symptomatic behavioral disturbances including agitation, motor restlessness, outbursts and hostility remain a major problem in clinical management of gerontopsychiatric patients. Termination of home care and subsequent hospitalisation is caused largely by behavior disturbances and not cognitive deficits. Clinical efficacy of neuroleptic treatment seems to be modest and is limited by unwanted side effects. Carbamazepine shows psychotropic effects and seems to improve limbic pathology including aggression and poor impulse control in various psychiatric disorders. Treatment with carbamazepine was evaluated in an open study design in 29 gerontopsychiatric inpatients. Carbamazepine was efficient in treating agitated behavior disturbances in dementia and other disorders. Adverse effects of the drug showed up only in a small percentage of the patients and were reversible after discontinuation of the drug. The results suggest that carbamazepine may be effective in treating agitated behavior in gerontopsychiatric patients with different disorders. It may represent a sensible alternative or complementation to other therapeutic interventions.","2492":"After beginning the gerontopsychiatric ambulance the number of patients, who had to be treated in the psychiatric hospital could be reduced about 20% during one year. Nevertheless, the total number of ambulant and\/or stationary treatments increased continuately as the years ago. More patients could be sent home or to their families after stationary therapy than before starting the ambulance, less patients had to be sent to nursing homes or the other hospitals. Especially patients with severe demential disorders had to stay in hospital for a shorter time (30%). The number of ambulant treated patients increased during the same time at a third, the number of consultations of other non-psychiatric hospitals at a sixth.","2493":"Day hospital treatment for psycho-geriatric patients in the Federal Republic of Germany started in 1976. At present (October 1991) 13 psychogeriatric day hospitals are established. The day hospitals offer a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Though they are expected to be of great importance especially for the elderly, day hospitals don't play a significant part within the care system for psycho-geriatric patients in Germany. It seems to be recommendable, to establish more psycho-geriatric day hospitals, especially together with an out-patient department and an information centre (\"Geronto-psychiatrisches Zentrum\"). In addition the care system should be supplied with day centres, in particular for those patients suffering from chronic paranoid psychosis or dementia; the medical care of out-patients should be improved. Besides that the efficacy of day hospital treatment for psycho-geriatric patients should be evaluated.","2494":"Delirium--a state of acute or subacute confusion--is a common organic mental syndrome occurring predominantly in old age. The disorder is highly prevalent in psychiatric institutions, in general hospitals and nursing homes. Patients affected by delirium carry an increased mortality-risk and will become dependent on nursing care in a high percentage. In this paper, diagnostic criteria, symptomatology, and pathogenesis of delirious states are reviewed. The wide variety of etiologic factors is illustrated by case histories. The present state of diagnostic and therapeutic management is discussed. A review of recent publications indicates that substantial advances in knowledge on epidemiology, operationalized diagnosis, risk factors, and course of delirium have been attained. There are, however, important aspects--e.g. the evaluation of prophylactic and therapeutic measures--which have been neglected. With regard to the high prevalence of delirium and the inderdisciplinary relevance of this syndrome scientific activities on this field should be increased as well as refreshment of knowledge of medical and nursing staff should be aimed at.","2495":"","2496":"In the last three decades there has been a growing scientific interest in users' assessment of psychiatric services and treatment. The \"consumer satisfaction\" research found that the majority of users show a high level of global satisfaction with the treatment they are receiving. Controlled and randomized studies in different treatment settings showed that users are significantly more satisfied with partial hospitalization and community care than with standard hospital care. Only a few consistent associations were found between sociodemographic data, clinical history and assessment of treatment, while a higher degree of chopathological symptoms was always correlated with a more negative assessment of treatment. Users' assessment of treatment is not only important as an outcome criterion of treatment but can also influence the therapeutic process itself and predict outcome. The interpretation of the findings is limited by several methodological and conceptual problems. The shortcomings and the relevance of users' assessment, e.g. in regard to improvement of psychiatric care are discussed.","2497":"","2498":"","2499":"A patient with a paranoid psychosis becomes pregnant. The course of the symptomatology as well as considerations about the psychopharmacological, psychotherapeutical and social treatment were described.","2500":"The rates of compulsory admission and detention for 1991-1992 were provided by 32 German psychiatric hospitals and departments. Very low rates were found in the eastern states and wide variation in rate in the western (as in 1984). In 1991-1992 the median value for compulsory admission was 28.8 and for detention during the course of in-patient treatment 10.0 per 100,000 inhabitants per year.","2501":"55 visitors from five recreation and social clubs for mentally ill clients have been described, related to some sociographic data including the number of times the club is frequented, the duration of membership in the club as well as the source of information. They were asked to give their opinions on the frequency and the duration of the meetings and the quality of the clubrooms, the care and the programmes. They give the reasons for attending the clubs and the resulting main effects. They make wishes and complaints about the clubs. The results of the questioning are compared to the description of tasks and aims of clubs as seen from the professional point of view in order to find conformities and\/or differences. On the whole a consensus is to be seen. Differences can be ascertained, where the professional aim is mainly of therapeutic nature. Such a target does not meet the needs of the visitors. For them the social aspect is of main importance in a surrounding offering protection, acceptance, understanding and support.","2502":"The article gives an insight into the psychiatric care system in Japan. Psychiatric hospitals mainly are in private ownership and compared to international standards their situation is characterized by lack of qualified personnel and high number of chronically long-stay patients. Complementary community services are still rare, positive developments have started, however, in vocational rehabilitation and occupation of the mentally ill in community workshops.","2503":"About one third (29.5%) of the population living within the area of Frankfurt, for which the psychiatric university clinic provides psychiatric service, are foreigners. For the better understanding of our foreign psychiatric inpatients treated in our clinic in in 1992, the diagnostic spectrum and the nationalities of these patients were analysed. More than half of them (58%) were raised up in former Yugoslavia, Turkey, Italy, Poland and Marocco. The other foreign patients came from 36 different countries. The diagnostic spectrum comparing german and foreign patients showed marked differences. Paranoid schizophrenia was more common in foreigners (31.5%) compared with german patients (16.8%), as well as female foreigners were admitted to the clinic because of psychoreactive disorders (65.2% of all turkish females) more often. The language barrier limited the treatment in many patients. In addition treatment was also hampered by family induced pressure on our patients. This was mainly due to differences and misunderstanding concerning the nature and treatment strategies. In spite of these difficulties, engagement of the therapeutic teams and treatment outcome did not differ between german and foreign patients. In order to improve treatment modalities, we quote for an increasing number of psychiatrists, who are capable of serbocroatic, turkish, italian, polish or arab language and culture, to work in clinical psychiatry.","2504":"Ethnic discrimination represents a social and psychological reality. As can be shown by case-material, it affects in a way specific for the individual developmental processes and psychic well-being. Referring to Goffman's concept of social identity the psychological impact of ethnic discrimination is described in psychiatric patients. Finally therapeutic and preventive implications are outlined.","2505":"The growing acceptance of Zubin's vulnerability-stressor-modell in research and clinical practice stresses the importance of schizophrenic patients individual coping strategies. Coping strategies are influenced not only by individual cognitions concerning the actual illness but also by opinions of key-persons within the social network of the patient. Research on the acquisition of patients subjective view of the schizophrenic illness has to integrate both the individual psychological resources as well as the social context variables. The present paper reports about in depth open interviews with six patients and their key relatives. The results were derived from a structural analysis of the tape-recorded and transcribed interviews. Patients showed a broad variety of etiological explanations of their illness and expressed a need for more comprehensive information (part 1). Parents stated a more pessimistic prognosis of the course of illness than patients. Both patients and parents complained about the lack of mutual communication about the illness and its symptoms (part 2). Implications of these results concerning psychoeducational programs for patients and families as well are discussed.","2506":"","2507":"Relatives of mental ill have their own problems.

The question arises if this is a result of the psychiatric and psychopharmacological knowledge students have acquired during their medical education or an effect of selection by which students already have a more positive opinion of psychotropic drugs before the commencement of their medical education. Our survey in three differently advanced groups of medical students (n = 323) was carried out with a questionnaire. In contrast to their scepticism concerning psychopharmacological treatment students in the beginning of their medical education estimate others than psychotropic drugs ly than the lay public. This may be explained by a beginning identification with the model of a quickly and effectively treating doctor. In the course of medical and especially psychiatric and psychopharmacological education, there is a tendency to a more differentiated and positive view on the effects of psychotropic drugs although the generally critical attitude persists.","2510":"The attitudes of medical students towards psychotropic drugs are compared with those of the general public. Students strike a more positive balance between the costs and benefits of this treatment method. Whereas there are no marked differences as concerns desirable effects both groups differ considerably in the assessment of the limitations and risk of undesirable side-effects with students being less sceptical in this respect. Also with regard to other attitudinal domains student's judgement is more favourable. However, this does not mean that there is not a remarkably large group which articulates reservations against the use of psychotropic drugs. Whereas the majority of the lay public considers psychotherapy in general as superior to psychopharmacotherapy most students tend to differentiate between the various forms of psychiatric disorder.","2511":"After describing decisive factors of suicide prevention on Psychiatric wards criterias are developed to diagnose the self-states of acute suicidal psychiatric patients. Guidelines for an intraindividual and interindividual suicide-prevention are presented.","2512":"Reviewing the literature factors of suicide-prevention on Psychiatric wards are specified. Suicide crisis is interpreted as narcissistic crisis. On the background of new findings of the American baby-watchers considerations were made on the development of the self and pathologic states of self with respect to suicidal patients.","2513":"","2514":"The relationships of subjective quality of life in nine domains and negative symptoms, duration of illness, dosage of a neuroleptic and neuroleptic side-effects are investigated in 30 chronic schizophrenic patients. Negative symptoms show negative correlations with four domains (safety, social relations, health, leisure), duration of illness with three domains (health, leisure, living situation). Whereas the dosage of a neuroleptic relates to safety only, neuroleptic side-effects correlate with five domains (social relations, health, safety, living situation, work and employment). The results are discussed in the light of clinical experience and former empirical studies. Proposals for further research are presented.","2515":"","2516":"The treatment of patients who are dependent on opiates has definitely been including drug substitution besides withdrawal and weaning in the Swiss urban community (\"Kanton\") of Basel City since 1980. After a significant increase of treatments in 1987 in connection with the spread of HIV infections, more than 800 patients were presently receiving substitution treatment according to a descentralised schedule. The type of long-term treatment is illustrated by sociodemographic and treatment data of 500 substituted individuals who are mostly being looked after always by the same persons entrusted with caring for them. This represents a flexible, economically feasible and highly individual type of care and treatment that can help to reduce illegal drug consumption and hence the undesirable events associated with it in an urban district such as Basel city.","2517":"","2518":"The care for mentally handicapped subjects in a geographically, linguistically and socioculturally well defined region of Switzerland (the region \"Oberwallis\") is described. The care and the treatment are following a systemic model. The mentally handicapped live outside the psychiatric hospital in social integrated housing and working structures, which are established by an autonomous organized association. There exists a close cooperation between this association and the psychiatric hospital, which is integrated in a general hospital. Both institutions, the common theoretical basis and forms of cooperation are described.","2519":"The effectivity of prohibiting the use of drugs is discussed against the background of crimes committed in connection with drugs. The theoretical and possible practical consequences of liberalisation are presented under legal aspects in respect of criminal offence in the wake of drug abuse. Since the concepts applied so far have been largely unsuccessful, it is high time to try out new approaches to the problem.","2520":"At an index day all 166 patients of the Department of General Psychiatry were asked whether changes of working or housing condition were considered necessary and which definite steps had to be done. In 85 (51.2%) of 166 patients changes were considered necessary. What measures had been initiated or carried out? Concerning the housing situation age and disease (psychiatric diagnosis) proved to be important factors; concerning the working situation age, sex, socioeconomic status and length of unemployment were important.","2521":"This paper gives a short review about the available literature concerning the impacts of age of alcoholism onset. Empirical studies of the last twenty years have mainly tried to find differences between onset during youth and the middle age. There are only few reports about specific characteristics of patients, who have developed alcoholism in their older age. Biological and psychosocial findings and therapeutic considerations are described. Their account on further research and practical care are discussed.","2522":"The report describes the inpatient and out-patient treatment facilities for alcoholics in a defined catchment area and the experience gathered by the initiation of out-patient group therapy for a group of alcoholics at the general community hospital in Offenbach\/Main. The goal of the group therapy at the hospital was to establish post-withdrawal treatment care for alcoholics after short-term clinical and long-term sanatorium withdrawals. It was hoped that group therapy experience would reduce the high drop-out rate of patients after hospitalization and after long-term sanatorium treatment, especially by patients with more severe social or psychic disorders. Experience showed that those capable of group therapy maintained contact to the group, others, the main target group of patients took little advantage of the therapy offered.","2523":null,"2524":"The treatment of patients who are dependent on drugs is undergoing a conceptual change, and in this connection more attention is being paid to a qualified withdrawal and weaning.

This overview presents and discusses behaviour therapy oriented studies (in the main part single case studies). The majority of studies show that it is in principle possible to influence this symptomatology. Because of methodological limitations of many studies finally some proposals for future research are discussed.","2534":"The interest in the psychopharmacological treatment of the borderline personality disorder (BPS) has been steadily increased in the last years. There isn't, however, any investigation, which has proved the existence of a specific \"Anti-Borderline-Drug\" yet. There are, however, identifiable drug-responsive syndromes. The description by Coccaro and Karoussi (1991) of a syndrome of affective instability (abnormalities in the brain's adrenergic and cholinergic systems, respond to carbamazepine and lithium), transient psychotic phenomena (abnormalities in the central dopaminergic systems, respond to low-dose neuroleptics) and impulsive, aggressive behaviour (abnormalities in the central serotonergic systems, respond to serotonergic agents) seems to be very promising in this regard.","2535":"According to the Canon Law (CIC) of the catholic church a marriage can be annulled because of psychological inability under certain conditions. We present the case report of a married woman, who fell ill with cyclothymia after her first childbirth. Her marriage was annulled under canon 1095 (n.3 CIC) because of psychological inability to fulfill martial obligations. The authors believe that this represents a clear cut case of discrimination against patients with mental disorders: on the one hand the catholic church claims that every martial bond is principally indissoluble; on the other hand they do not eschew invalidating a marriage due to an affective psychosis. This poses special problems which are also discussed.","2536":"","2537":"Regular inclusion of a social worker alongside the expertising physician whenever a judge has to decide on committing a person to a psychiatric hospital, is known in German legal practice as \"Stuttgart model\".

The possible role of substance abuse as a risk factor for delinquency or casualties in schizophrenia is discussed.","2541":"In this paper criteria for the assessment of the ability of psychiatric patients to give an informed consent are presented. Legal and medical aspects including jurisdiction are discussed. Some elements for a judgement of an informed consent are proposed.","2542":"","2543":"In this history of psychiatric therapy the progressive paralysis deserves special interest: for the first time an organic psychosis was treatable successfully by a procedure found by scientific methods. This article describes life and work of Julius Wagner, Ritter von Jauregg (1857-1940) and remembers the introduction of the malaria-therapy, which was developed by Wagner 75 years ago.","2544":"In a big psychiatric hospital we began 1987 to practice cognitive training with our patients after teaching this therapy to male and female nurses. Now we report how this project found its development, which overall experiences there were made and which corrections still have to be done.","2545":"Negative prejudices against psychiatry and psychiatric patients are a reality today. But prejudices are also existent in the patients self, especially in schizophrenic patients, leading to adverse therapeutic reactions. Prejudices of the patients himself may be a hidden, unconscious problem in some cases of treatment resistance in rehabilitation of schizophrenic patients. Therapeutic strategies are discussed on the basis of case reports.","2546":"This is a survey of the treatment courses provided so far during the initial period after the foundation of a psychotherapeutic outpatient ward of a Department of Psychiatry in a General Hospital. A relatively small benefit only is actually derived from this institution by the Department of Psychiatry: this benefit consisting of the fact that inpatients requiring psychotherapeutic treatment can be referred quickly to outpatient treatment in the psychotherapeutic ward. As a matter of fact, however, the outpatient ward barely fills the considerable gap in psychotherapeutic facilities available in the city of Oberhausen in Germany, whereas on the other hand adequate financial sponsoring has not been satisfactorily assured to date. Almost half of the referred patients were unsuitable for the depth psychology treatment offered by the outpatient ward and had therefore to be ruled out.","2547":"In psychiatric facilities we treat patients with severe disturbances under conditions which do not fulfill what are generally thought to be the necessary ingredients of psychotherapy. Additionally our staff tend to devalorate themselves by thinking that in fact they should work differently that, what they do, was actually not real psychotherapy. The present paper shows with concrete examples what is psychiatric psychotherapy, it asks what are the needs of severely ill patients, and concludes that this difficult work is real psychotherapy in the best sense of the word.","2548":"Patients and nurses assessed the social atmosphere in two psychiatric acute care units and their behavior was recorded before and after the observation ward and the residential ward were transformed into two fully functioning admission wards, avoiding transference of patients. Consequently, the initially high amount of isolated behavior decreased, social behavior and outdoor activities increased. For the patients, however, the stereotype of a psychiatric acute care unit does not change so soon because of their higher aspiration levels and their uncertainty about the treatment concept. As the new structures increasingly are filled with life, \"environmental therapy\" aimed at the patients' involvement gains a great importance.","2549":"The management of the violent patient in hospital requires highly skilled therapeutic staff. Prevention, restriction and therapy of aggressive behaviour needs adequate diagnosis and therapy of the underlying disorder, furthermore a well structured ward milieu. This study pays attention to maladaptive structuring of the therapeutic milieu, which interferes with the integration of the violent patient. Modernized psychiatric institutions with liberal administration tend to expel the troublesome, especially the violent patient, when the formal organization of the institution superstructure is weakened.","2550":"A special group of psychiatric patients appeared during the last few years; patients who confront their therapists with many diagnostical and therapeutic problems, namely patients with dual diagnosis. These patients suffer from a severe psychiatric illness (such as schizophrenia) and at the same from an addition (e.g. an alcohol-dependency). The management for patients with dual diagnosis is inappropriate as well in psychiatric units as in specialized addition units. Today specialized units for patients with dual diagnosis are non-existent in Switzerland. The following review presents theoretical implications, empirical data and therapeutic possibilities for patients with dual diagnosis.","2551":"Within a controlled intervention study with schizophrenic outpatients we investigated the question of whether regular attendance at psychoeducational training for medication management has an influence on patients' illness-related behavior. The patients in the treatment group show better outcome of compliance and some treatment-related attitudes, though without statistical significance. Despite extensive information they are no more content with their knowledge of drugs than the control group, but more aware of problems, i.e. more cautious in medication co-determination.","2552":"The number of patients suffering from chronic mental disorders but living outside the psychiatric hospital is undergoing a steady increase, which is reflected in an increasing demand for appropriate vocational and occupational facilities. This demand is met primarily by outpatient work therapy, self-help enterprises and enterprises providing jobs to supplement pensions, and by special departments for the mentally retarded in workshops for the handicapped. Within the framework of a prospective study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill, 502 rehabilitants forming a representative sample for the Westphalia-Lippe region of Germany were examined. This sample comprised 313 male and 189 female probands with an average age of 36, almost two-thirds of them suffering from schizophrenic disorders. Only 12.8% of those questioned are able to cover their living expenses primarily from their earnings. Half of them are living in sheltered accommodation, one quarter with their parents, and only one quarter on their own. Most are resigned to remaining in sheltered employment. Only 16.7% expect to change to the open labour market. The level of subjective job satisfaction is high in general. Together with other complementary facilities, sheltered employment permits chronically ill patients to live outside the psychiatric hospital and offers them positive social and psychological aspects of work. With few exceptions, it does not offer an opportunity to cover living expenses. Our follow-up investigations will provide information on the further course of vocational rehabilitation.","2553":"The legal requirements and research work done until now on rehabilitative cognitive methods will be critically reviewed in terms of possible therapeutic achievements. Cognitive deficits, like attention and concentration disturbances and abstract and differentiation ability, can be improved clearly by these therapy programs; however, a remission cannot be achieved.","2554":"This article resumes the most important results of quality of life research on chronic mentally ill patients and argues for the importance of this perspective of evaluation-research. Chronic mentally ill persons experience less quality of life than the general population. Rehabilitation-programs improve the quality of life of chronic mentally ill patients. There is a covariation between better quality of life and length of the interval without being recidivous. Patients of community based programs report a better quality of life than long-term psychiatric inpatients. Finally some open questions and problems concerning quality of life research on the chronically mentally ill are discussed.","2555":"","2556":"The project \"Friday-Club\" presents weekly short lectures to topics concerning mental health and illness. Participants are mostly chronic psychiatric patients, both in- and out-patients. Description of this well accepted course, its goals, means and perspectives.","2557":"The systemic wave, after passing consultation services and psychiatric clinics for children and adolescents, now reaches the other psychiatric areas--for some alarming, for others long time expected. In this article we want to present the basic beliefs and the resulting methods of this approach, hoping to stimulate as many clinicians as possible to be curious about and to get in contact with the \"systemic thinking\".","2558":"In a total sample of 141 mentally retarded adults the quality of social relationships was assessed by the newly developed \"Interview for Social Support in Mentally Retarded Adults\". Severely mentally retarded persons have close and intimate relationships to a consistently lesser extent than mildly retarded persons. This holds also true for the residents of relatively large institutions compared--under control of the degree of mental retardation--to those of small community based facilities. Social support is not related to age and sex.","2559":"For a long time, the standard treatment for alcoholics in Germany consisted of a six month inpatient treatment period. Only recently, shorter treatment modalities with more emphasis on outpatient treatment were proposed. We evaluate a community based treatment model which combines a six week inpatient period with one year of outpatient treatment. During eight years, we saw 790 patients. After one year, 68% were globally improved. Ten years after treatment half of the 1976 sample were abstinent. Thus, a subgroup of alcoholics seem to benefit from community based programs. They are characterized by fair social adaptation and the willingness of their relatives to actively participate in the treatment.","2560":"When discussing and dealing with the way things went with German psychiatry during fascism the question arises constantly as to the scientific and theoretic self-interpretation of a specialist discipline that allowed itself to be misused without offering much resistance, if at all. The article makes an attempt to trace a few paths of specialist ideology at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century. The misuse of psychiatry and by psychiatry that has been practised both in the past and in the present cannot be understood if the guiding concepts of science generally ruling at the time are ignored.","2561":"The development of hypothyroidism and the forming of a goiter are well-known complications associated with lithium medications. But there are also occasional references to cases of hyperthyroidism in the wake of both continual and of discontinued lithium medication. In the case being reported on here of a lady patient aged 64 and suffering from a toxic adenoma not recognized at the time, thyrotoxicosis accompanied by above-normal FT-3 results and the characteristic clinical symptoms developed when lithium medication was discontinued. Medical literature consulted in the context discussed pharmacological mechanisms which may be responsible for the said complications.","2562":"Basing on the multifarious phenomena of hospitalism in chronically mentally ill patients the authors report on a survey of known facts and analyses to enable focussing of appropriate on-target measures were taken to arrive at conclusions for caring for these long-term patients: 1. Fixing the deadline of the study; 2. Determining the quality of patient care; 3. Analysing the experiences collected in respect of the integrated training programme to promote cognitive, communicative and social abilities and skills among the patients in resident living quarters within the confines of the hospital. An attempt is made to arrive at an overall evaluation of the measures taken so far in respect of de-hospitalisation and in building up complementary settlements outside the hospital but close to communal institutions.","2563":"This paper tries to show how stimulating the mutual effects of modeling, providing a network of psychiatric facilities and research can be in the care of young adult chronic patients. However, they do not behave all the same and require various strategies in therapy. Under the influence of a new model of Sheets et al. (1982), the young adult chronic patients are classified into three subgroups: the \"High-Functioning, High-Aspiration\"-, \"Low-Energy, Low-Demand\"- and the \"High-Energy, High-Demand\"-group. With the example of the situation in Berne it can be shown that each group needs different facilities. The own research allows conclusions about the efficacy of the therapeutic offers. On the other hand, it stresses the point that especially the group of \"High-Energy, High-Demand\"-patients are a major challenge for us in psychiatry. Finally some reflections are presented how we professionals can deal with these patients in future to do more justice to them.","2564":"Sexual behavior of patients in psychiatric admission wards is still only seldom spoken about, despite its relatively frequent occurrence in various forms and the emotional impact it bears on the psychiatric staff. The sexual issues have to be discussed with every patient. Among other things, the patients should be provided with information and the communicative meaning of his or her sexual manifestations should be elucidated and worked through psychotherapeutically. In the ward, a prohibitive attitude toward genital sexuality is justified; otherwise a flexible attitude should be assumed, which always takes the actual condition of the patient into consideration.","2565":"The study herewith represents the conception of the Bonn \"anxiety\"-ambulance, which was established in the University of Bonn, Department of Psychiatry, in January 1991. Besides we report our experiences from the first four months after opening of our ambulance and present first results.","2566":"Characteristics of the present ecological threat concerning the mind of men are described. Some psychiatric cases are given describing on one hand psychotic patients whose concern about the endangered natural environment is more accidental, whereas in other patients the feeling to be threatened has been resulted in psychopathological reactions of clinical importance. The impact of these new aspects of an ecological medicine is emphasized.","2567":"An investigation on the use of psychotropic drugs in a Swiss university psychiatric hospital shows that compared with other drug surveys drugs were prescribed to relatively fewer patients and polypharmacy was used in less than 50% of the patients. The most frequently administered drugs were neuroleptics, among which, surprisingly. Clozapine ranked first. Antidepressants were prescribed in relatively low doses. A drug survey like ours can provide a basis for the critical discussion of prescribing habits.","2568":null,"2569":"In the first and the second part of this study we reported about first examination and a six month follow-up in patients who had left East-Germany in 1989. In this third and last part, findings of a two and a half year follow-up in 52 patients are shown. 92% of the patients reported further improvement, 87% stated to have an adequate job, and also 87% to have satisfactory accommodation. Frequency of complaints and level of psychopathological symptoms were clearly reduced. This positive change was not due to psychiatric treatment.","2570":"In the first part of this study we investigated people who had left East Germany and sought psychiatric help within six weeks after their move. 94 patients were re-examined approximately six month later. Meanwhile 40% had found an adequate job and 44% satisfactory accommodation. 65% stated that some of their original hopes had remained unfulfilled in the west. However, in general patients viewed significantly fewer problems associated with integration in the West, than in the first interview. Symptoms were clearly improved according to clinical and self-ratings. Only three patients reported an overall deterioration. Sociodemographic and clinical variables as assessed in the first interview--including diagnostic classification according to ICD-9 and DSM-III-R-, allowed only a limited prediction of different outcome criteria.","2571":"Patient characteristics and treatment modalities of a psychogeriatric day hospital are analyzed on the basis of demographic, illness- and treatment-related data from a 5-year-period. Specific potentials and tasks of the day hospital in the care of the mentally ill elderly are discussed.","2572":"The management of dementing disorders among the elderly is gaining in importance as a public-health objective. In recent years, a number of studies in Germany have indicated a relatively high frequency of organic brain syndromes among the elderly patients of the \"Sozialstationen\" (community nursing services). A survey was carried out of all over-65-year-old patients (n = 1842) cared for during one month by such units in the city of Mannheim. The level of cognitive functioning of each patient was rated by the nurses, and the different forms of care provided were recorded. The research findings confirm that dementia and related conditions occur frequently in this patient population. The nurses rated 11 per cent of the patients as clinically demented and a further 14 per cent as suffering from milder cognitive disorders (\"mild dementia\"). While the number of items of care directly related to medical treatment remained fairly constant, the frequency of all measures of basic nursing care increased in direct proportion to the degree of the patient's cognitive impairment. These findings have implications for the future organization and development of community nursing services.","2573":"The problems of the psychiatric expertise of neurotic patients in the field of disability pension in the Federal Republic of Germany are described. Some main ideas for the psychiatric expert are proposed. In consideration of the therapeutic problems, preventive measures should be developed. To prevent a chronic illness, some hints for the treating physician are given. Some research problems are mentioned.","2574":"This paper attempts to describe the relationship between violence and suicidality according to phenomenological, biological and psychodynamic aspects. In bringing together these aspects a model of human aggressive behaviour is represented.","2575":"","2576":"Through a Korean freechristian priest, who brought about an atmosphere of syncretism, a Korean patient was introduced by withdrawal of sleep into a shortterm state of artificial psychosis which lead to her attempting suicide. The therapeutic intervention based on the ideas of Rogers was successful in creating a basis of confidence between the patient and the doctor. Through this process it was possible to obtain further personal information, in particular concerning the patient's grandmother, who was a shamanistic mudang. In connection with the knowledge about the patient's cultural background and its ties to shamanism, and respecting the cultural content without evaluating it, a good presupposition was given for an effective therapy.","2577":"The graph of the frequency distribution of rehospitalization shows a constant exponential decline without demarking a particular population of so-called \"revolving-door\" patients. Patients with at least four admissions to a regional psychiatry hospital within a time span of two years are compared to a control group of the total clinic population. Multiple admission patients suffer significantly more often from diseases with an unfavourable prognosis, the illness has started earlier in their lives, and the course of illness is marked by unstable dynamic states with frequent crises of suicide. A demographic analysis shows the group under survey to be younger and less often married; participation in the world of labour has been lost more often, schizophrenics who have frequently stayed in hospitals even loose their former autonomy in housing. Guardianships are significantly more often installed, but they have not proved to be an efficient form of help. The therapeutic care of this problem patients is rather unsatisfactory. The offered ambulatory services are not claimed and in hospital the special treatment units fail to reach these patients. Lack of therapeutic continuity and compliance determines the course of treatment and complicates therapeutic strategies.","2578":"Chronically disabled psychiatric patients who are living outside hospital still need help. The degree of disability they show and the support which they receive from family or friends differs greatly. How they manage will depend on their ability to adapt and one can recognize the difference between those who adapt well in spite of disability and those for whom this is very difficult. In consequence their need for support from others varies. In England some national voluntary agencies traditionally offer support. However, today the combined work of voluntary organisations, hospitals and statutory community authorities in local areas is often impressive and two examples are described. Even so families are perhaps still the most important form of support although some are unable or unwilling to help. Other alternative forms of help noted are two-patient marriages, long-term hospital support of discharged patients and regular employment. Examples of innovations in Australia and the U.S.A. are also described.","2579":null,"2580":"The situation of persons with mental illness, who work in workshops for the handicapped, and the problems they have to deal with, are discussed. Concepts of the psychology of work, which nearly have not been recognized in the field of vocational rehabilitation are described. In a study in several workshops the relationship between job conditions and social support at the workplace and the personnel development of the mentally ill was investigated. The results show that above all the perceived job characteristics as well as social support are important for a positive development of the personality--both at the workplace and during leisure time.","2581":"The recommendations for the reorganization of German psychiatry were associated with the expectation that institutional protection can be reduced in a comprehensive community care system on the longterm basis and that a stabilization can be achieved during treatment with a minimum share in full and partial hospitalization. To test this assumption we studied the institutional pathways of 136 chronic, mainly schizophrenic patients within the comprehensive care system of the Department of Social Psychiatry over two years. A cluster analysis of sequence and intensity of institutional care showed three major types of use of the system: as a rehabilitation system, as an alternative and flexible care system, and as a traditional \"dual-care-system\". These patterns of institutional pathways were analyzed regarding predictors from patient's history. Consequences are discussed concerning further development of community mental health, coordination of services and continuity of care.","2582":"The significance of intuitive prognostic assessments by the nursing staff and the examining female doctor is studied with regard to the course and results of \"late rehabilitation\" of 30 psychiatric patients who had been hospitalised for many years. Using standardised assessment criteria and catamnestic data on readmission as inpatients (covering a period of 20 months) patients were compared who had been discharged from the psychiatric hospital, transferred to long-term residential quarters, and assessed before discharge as likely or unlikely to be readmitted to the hospital. The group of patients who had been given an unfavourable prognosis--most of them women--proved in course of time to be readmitted as inpatients more often and to be significantly more disturbed than the patients who had been discharged with a more favourable prognosis. These results are discussed with regard to sociopolitical and medical care aspects and to approaches for further research in this direction.","2583":"","2584":"We report on clinical observations from a 10-bed psychiatric acute ward where predominantly patients with concurrent physical diseases are treated. Of 287 patients admitted within 18 months we detected serious physical illness previously unrecognized or at least not sufficiently diagnosed in 15 cases (5.2%; age 17-88 years; 4 m, 11 f). Six patients suffered from acute neurological disease. One or more extracerebral disorders were found in nine cases. 14 of the 15 patients presented with organic mental syndromes classified according to ICD-9 (acute organic psychosis: n = 8, chronic organic psychosis: n = 6). The physical diseases unknown at admission were the only cause of the acute organic psychoses while they were contributing to the development of psychiatric symptoms in the majority of the other patients. In 14 patients the diagnosis of the previously unrecognized illnesses led to a significant change of therapy. At discharge 10 patients had improved with regard to their somatic and mental state while in two cases only the physical symptoms had remitted. One patient remained completely unchanged and two patients died from their serious diseases. Our case studies illustrate the fact that a relevant proportion of newly admitted psychiatric patients suffers from life-threatening medical illnesses. These require prompt and specific interventions and can only be detected by early and thorough physical examination.","2585":"Basing on the examination of 82.767 EEGs, 118 patients with theta rhythm variant (GRV) were found out. From their case-histories all particulars taken to be important were gathered by means of a questionnaire. In addition to this 70 of these patients were interviewed, mostly in the course of a visit at home, in order to supplement the data by catamnestic informations. Moreover, attending family doctors were asked for informations, and from 14 patients elsewhere recorded EEGs were evaluated. With regard to its cycles per second, the GRV proved to be stable even for long periods, but as to its coming to the fore a slight changeability revealed. Concerning physical complaints, the patients primarily suffered from headache, giddiness, and liability to fainting fits, secondary they frequently were affected with vegetative disorders and stomach complaints. In view of the psychic aspect striking often came to light unrest, lack of vitality, disturbed social contacts, sexual problems, anxiety fits, depressive reactions, and suicidal thoughts. High sensitiveness and insufficient self-sureness in many cases were conspicuous attributes. In particular men often failed in establishing or maintaining intimate human relations, so that many of them remained single, made at best only few friends, and easily became outsiders. Inability to enforce own desires against opposition, liability of mood, ill-humor, discontent, or even jealousy frequently made their appearance. As to gainful employment and professional status several of them were less successful than their siblings and their parents. ","2586":"Retrospectively 20% of more than 200 patients with myasthenia gravis reported being initially diagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder. Younger women are significantly most at risk of a psychiatric misdiagnosis whereas men are more often subject to somatic misdiagnoses. The sample's mean duration of the disease was 10 years. Nevertheless misdiagnoses still coincide with higher depression scores. Depression is also related to the dosage of anticholinesteratic medication as well as to the self-reported muscular weakness. Personality assessment through an inventory reveals only slight emotional instabilities and no illness specific profiles.","2587":"Four patients with neuroradiological evidence of normal pressure hydrocephalus and psychiatric diagnosis of affective psychoses with major depression--like characteristics are presented. Three patients underwent shunting operations following an observation period of 2 to 6 years. During the post-operative follow-up of 3 to 7 years, resp., no clinical changes were noted. In our opinion, and following critical evaluation of the available literature, major depression--like affective disorders in normal-pressure hydrocephalus are not influenced by shunting operations, unless they occur simultaneously as an additional symptom in an Adams-Hakim syndrome with definite progression.","2588":"We report on the administrative incidence of alcoholism as registered by admissions for treatment in the regional psychiatric hospital, in Vorarlberg, caring for approximately 330,000 inhabitants. 1967, 1977 and 1987 were chosen as years of observation, thus describing the regional development of alcoholism in the last 20 years. Selected epidemiological data are compared to those of local population. Over the years a vast increase in admissions and treatments was registered--a result of changes in information on the addiction itself and improvement in facilities, staff and medical care in general. Whereas female involvement has sharply risen as compared to earlier decades, it now appears to have studied at a rate of 3:1 (m:f). In 1987 juvenile alcoholism as rated by hospital-admissions had comparatively declined. A greater number of married alcoholics in more qualified positions decided on treatment. Concordant somatic and psychiatric diseases are discussed. The results stress the importance of different approaches to motivation and treatment in this complex phenomenon.","2589":"A model of therapeutic community for the stationary treatment of patients with addictive diseases is outlined. Its leading idea says that the main task for patients as well as therapists is to try to integrate the polar concepts of empathy and discipline. Consequences of this framework for group psychotherapy are discussed with regard to the attitude of the therapist and to his behaviour within the session.","2590":"","2591":"","2592":"This study evaluates the concept of occupational therapy for schizophrenic outpatients. Preliminary results from 18 patients suggest that occupational therapy for outpatients might contribute to an improvement in cognitive-adaptive functions and open up ways for further integration on the job market. The prognosis was favourable when the outset of occupational therapy was not equated with a rise in the level of professional adaptation and a certain approachability and flexibility were to be observed in cognitive, affective and intentional aspects among the chronic schizophrenic patients. With regard to cognitive functions and to professional adaptation, it proved more favourable for occupational therapy to be carried out within the framework of regular service enterprises (external occupational therapy, n = 9) and not within training areas of the psychiatric institution itself (internal occupational therapy, n = 9). Patients taking part in internal occupational therapy felt more heavily burdened by workplace conditions, and greater family-related strain seemed to develop in the therapeutic centre than was the case among patients taking in external occupational therapy.","2593":"There is no doubt about the importance of psychopharmacological medication--antidepressants, neuroleptics, tranquilizer--in the treatment of severe mentally ill people. In the last years there are a lot of publications dealing with psychopharmacological treatment of suicidal crises. Recently a few number of reports discuss the promotion of suicidality during or after start of antidepressant therapy. In this paper psychopharmacological medication, especially antidepressant medication is discussed according to suicide prevention or promotion. The author differentiate between acute suicidal crisis and long term treatment of an underlying mental illness and recommend in acute crisis treatment with benzodiazepines and sedating neuroleptics supplying adequate basic treatment. Uptonow to part of psychopharmaca in the treatment of suicidal patients remains uncertain.","2594":"The authors report on two years of experience collected during jointly performed medico-pharmaceutical visits in a psychiatric hospital. From the viewpoint of quality assurance and quality control such a procedure has now gained topical importance. Attention is drawn to problematic drug regimens and interactions between drugs.","2595":"For a total of 89 outpatients of a schizophrenia outpatient clinic, the times of hospitalization up to 5 years before treatment in this institution, have been compared to the frequency of rehospitalization within up to 5 years of posthospital care. This treatment contained between 1 1\/2 and 2 years neuroleptic medication (one half as long-term prophylaxis, the other half as interval medication) and psychotherapy in form of single talk of partly in groups for patients and their relatives. Thru this, the duration of hospitalization, before 10 weeks by average per anno, could be reduced to 2.1 weeks yearly. Time-intensive and multi-dimensional posthospital care able to reduce the duration of hospitalizations essentially. This has also a positive influence on the total costs of treatment. The positive effect lasts only in part, by the end of posthospital care the times of rehospitalization increase slightly, especially by repeated sick patients.","2596":"A case of an acute dyskinesia of a young, schizophrenic woman caused by neuroleptic therapy is reported. The acute dyskinesia was the reason for a complete luxation in the jaw-joint. The patient showed phenomenons (brain-atrophy, cognitive dysfunction, negative symptoms) which are discussed to be connected with acute dyskinesia. They also are a danger-signal regarding the beginning of a tardive dyskinesia.","2597":"The neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially lethal consequence of treatment with neuroleptics. It is possible that a patient, suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome now, had no such illness in the past, while being treated with neuroleptics; furthermore he may respond well to rechallenge with the original agent in the future. The malignant neuroleptic syndrome of a 29 year old man, whom we treated with benperidole, is described. The course of the disease and the differential-diagnosis is stated. The ways of treatment with bromocriptine, dantrolene sodium and amantadine, as described in the literature, are presented. As the neuroleptic malignant syndrome ist rare many cases should be collected in order to enhance the knowledge of the etiology and the pathogenesis of that life--threatening complication of treatment with neuroleptic drugs.","2598":"In a cross-sectional study 473 schizophrenic patients of a great psychiatric hospital were served. It was looked for differences in patients' characteristics and pharmacotherapy according to the therapeutic-functional structure of the hospital (admission-Unit, sociotherapeutic and long-time wards). Differences in drug-management became evident on basis of a regimen, which applies high doses (number of psychotropic drugs, chlorpromacin-units) in general, despite recommendations in the literature. The treatment refractory patients in the long-time wards are found to be heterogeneous and the authors suggest alternative pharmacological and psychosocial interventions.","2599":"","2600":null,"2601":"The Bonn project \"Treatment of schizophrenia in Family\" is in the tradition of behavioristic and psychoeducative family intervention studies in England and USA. Information about psychosis and its neuroleptical treatment, communication and problem solving training are provided to schizophrenic patients and to their relatives at home. Important results and experiences of the 2-year-study are presented.","2602":"","2603":"Providing information about the disease and the way of coping with it has a central position in therapeutic interventions with families. By giving basic knowledge about schizophrenia to relatives we developed the practical conception of the psychoeducative relatives' group (information-group), a structured program, which is oriented toward concrete problem-solving and supportive behavior to cope with stress in the family. The effects of this group were investigated on the knowledge and subjective distress of 35 relatives related to the course of schizophrenia in comparison to a communication group. The participants of the information-group retained their knowledge after 9 months and their distress was decreased significantly. The relapse rate was reduced to 25%. The subjective distress correlated up to .41 with relapse after 9 months. A survey of the patients showed 70% improvements of the symptoms, 75% felt themselves better accepted by relatives. With the development of the relatives' distress scale a suitable instrument to measure distress is available.","2604":"A brief review of literature concerning educative methods of therapy of schizophrenics and their relatives will be used to discuss the similarities of these strategies, which differ in conception and intensity but are comparable considering their efficiency. A self-developed (eclectical) model of educative therapy and first experiences will be introduced. In view of the recessing character resp. the tendency towards chronicity in many cases of schizophrenia it seems, that the improvement of coping-abilities of the patients and their relatives dealing with the disease is a more promising goal concerning the long-term prognosis than focussing on \"healing\" or suppression of actual symptoms. In addition to information about the disease the individualized proceeding corresponding with the person's own experiences will be stressed. Only as far as the concept of disease is close to the one the patient has, it can become relevant for deeds.","2605":"The occurrence of a malignant neuroleptic syndromes accompanied by urinary retention under the treatment with fluphenazine and prothipendyl in a mentally disabled psychotic is reported. Early recognition of the syndrome and immediate termination of the neuroleptic treatment lead to its spontaneous remission. Subsequent neuroleptic treatment by clozapine was tolerated without further complications.","2606":null,"2607":"","2608":"Experience has shown that Muslim patients in psychiatry cause special problems. The article outlines the Islamic religion and demonstrates that Islam embraces all spheres of its follower's life. This causes many kinds of special behaviours and attitudes that have considerable consequences for psychiatric therapy. The consequences in the most important areas of therapy are illustrated, and this should enable the therapist to gain an adequate understanding of the world of his patients. However, if he works often with Muslim patients it will be essential for him to acquire a comprehensive knowledge of the religion on Islam.","2609":"With detailed reference to specific conditions of work and every day life in Siberia the authors give insight into methodological, preventive, and rehabilitative efforts to cope with significantly high chronification of patients with borderline symptoms.

In a group of 55 patients in different stages of the infection two psychiatric explorations were done within an interval of about one year. The findings were analysed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The degree of psychosocial functioning was estimated using the GAF-scale (axis 5 of DSM-III-R). The diagnosis of dementia was based on DSM-III-R-criteria. Most of the patients (72%) showed normal or only slightly remarkable psychopathologic findings at both times. A significant increase in psychopathologic conspicuousness in the course of the disease was only found for the subscore BPRS 2 (\"anergia\"). Dementia was seen in five patients (9%) and only in the stage of manifest immune deficiency syndrome (WR 6). All-together there was only a slight decrease of psychosocial functioning detectable (median on the GAF-scale 75), which only in dementia showed a significant reduction.","2612":"","2613":"In an open clinical trial patients with full-developed delirium tremens were treated either by controlled infusion of clomethiazol (n = 21) or by intravenous injections of clorazepate (n = 20). Acute symptomatic quickly decreased after a few days and medication could be reduced. By adding haloperidol a further stabilization in patients suffering from vivid hallucinations could be obtained. The duration of intravenous therapy and the total period of treatment did not differ in the two groups. Statistical analysis of cardiovascular parameters revealed a significant lower heart rate under clorazepate therapy. So treatment with clorazepate proved to be an alternative to standard therapy with clomethiazol even for severe cases of delirium tremens regarding its wide therapeutical range and the low rate of cardio-pulmonary complications.","2614":"In a retrospective study, data from 99 male and female inpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or alcohol withdrawal delirium, treated between 1977 and 1987, were analyzed. DSM-III criteria were used to assign the diagnosis of either withdrawal delirium (with obligatory clouding of consciousness) or alcohol withdrawal syndrome (without disturbances of consciousness and\/or perception). No statistically significant differences between the two groups were found with respect to the red and white blood count, liver enzymes, and electrolytes. Significant differences were found in calcium levels, lymphocyte counts, and in electrophoresis. However, these differences are of no use for diagnostic purpose. Moreover, they are unspecific with respect to etiology. Hence, the distinction between alcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcohol withdrawal delirium can only be made clinically, i.e., it is dependent on the presence or absence of a clouded consciousness. This is in line with the findings published by other investigators. In the light of our metabolic findings, alcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcohol withdrawal delirium represent the two extremes of a continuum rather than two separate nosological entities.","2615":"The case reports of four HIV positive psychiatric inpatients are presented, in the light of which widespread contact fears and avoidance reactions in lower offices of justice, social and health administration become evident. Attention is drawn to possible misuse of psychiatric hospitals for quarantine purpose as long as there are no clear provisions to deal with the increasing group of HIV subjects.","2616":"In a review of the literature it is shown that most HIV-infected patients experience psychoreactive disorders early in the course of the disease and psycho-organic disorders at its more advanced stages. The latter are due either to the HIV itself or to opportunistic infections and malignancies. Differential diagnoses comprise adverse-effects of chemotherapeutics or illicit drugs and, in addition, independent psychiatric disorders certains of which may be over-represented in high-risk groups. Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are reviewed.","2617":"Music therapy is presented as an integral part of the therapeutic program of an open reception ward at a state-funded psychiatric hospital. The target group for music therapy comprises schizophrenic patients whose primary psychopathological symptoms are characterized by basic disorders, autistic withdrawal, anergia and limited means of verbal communication. A sample of 30 schizophrenic patients selected for music therapy is described. The subjective evaluation and rating of the music therapy was registered using a specially developed questionnaire. The primary results are: 1. Music therapy has a high level of subjective acceptance among patients. 2. No negative effects are recorded despite the therapy being introduced in the post-acute phase. 3. The positive therapeutic effects quoted are relaxation, activation, reduced anxiety, easier contact-making, and improved opportunities for emotional expression. The duration of the effects is limited. 4. The training-related concept and the clearly structuring behavior of the group leader are given a positive rating by the patients.","2618":"The round table is the center of the activities in the outpatient service of the Sociopsychiatric University Clinic Bern. First the life at the round table is shortly described. Then the different functions of the round table in the care of psychiatric longterm patients are discussed in detail. So the patients, who are partly considerably handicapped, out of their social isolation. The so arising relationships can be helpful for the patients in different areas. Furthermore it can be shown, that the round table fullfills all the functions of an informal, open, sociotherapeutic group. We emphasize on the great importance of the open and tolerant atmosphere at the round table for the therapeutic effect of it.","2619":"In order to evaluate which single or combined factors can lead to best acceptance of continuing out-patient psychiatric care, a random sample of 73 patients diagnosed as schizophrenic were entered into a follow-up study on leaving a psychiatric hospital. In a given region with only one public mental health center it was found that early and comprehensive planning of hospital dismissal, cooperation of family and--where possible--no change of the responsible therapist led to a 84% rate of patients remaining in the regional psychiatric care system, with a rehospitalisation rate of 33% within a year. Literature on the subject is reviewed in perspective of the rather high acceptance of psychiatric aftercare and the rather low rate of rehospitalisation.","2620":"The interrelationship and predictive validity of certain outcome predictors were studied on 54 young schizophrenic patients. In the first year after outburst the illness shows a great variability and the course seems to be open. Neither the premorbid social adjustment nor the amount of negative symptoms seem to predict the course in the first year. But as in earlier studies the expectations of patient, relatives and staff show to have a certain predictive significance.","2621":"Ideas and concepts of the essence and nature of mental diseases have always been rooted in the current zeitgeist that usually regarded the psychotic patient as a helpless victim of demoniacal influences, degenerative processes, organic (endogenous) diseases or the dynamics of familial determinants, all of which seemingly destroyed or paralysed the autonomy of the person who became a schizophrenic. In consequence of these concepts the doctor-patient relationship (active expert-passive object of treatment) has largely been asymetrical, whereas at the same time the doctors' attitude towards the relatives was either indifferent or in the manner of a defence reaction, or of a corrective nature. Recent theories such as the concept of vulnerability and stress-coping stimulated new and fruitful forms of cooperation between doctor, patient and relatives. The schizophrenic patient is now being credited with a greater measure of possibilities to influence the prodromata, the course and the consequences of his psychosis. His relatives can help him in doing so, and in fact they should. Clearly formulated and easily appreciated information on this concept, as well as common attention to and assistance of self-protective and compensatory efforts to cope with psychological basic deficiencies, managing of stressors, early symptoms and handicaps. could promote a \"treatment partnership\" that is also effective as a preventive measure. The idea of a partnership therapy, too, is linked to current trends in research theory and practice that are characterised by the systemic paradigm while aiming at partially restoring the mental patients' capacity and right to act.","2622":"On an average of 16 months after discharge a questionnaire was sent to 156 female patients with depressive disorders who underwent treatment in an open psychiatric ward of the Nervenkrankenhaus Bayreuth during the years 1987 and 1988. The patients were asked to estimate the therapeutical value of treatment-elements available during the hospitalization. In each of the two diagnostic subgroups (endogenous vs. psychogenic depressive disorders) 60% of the patients sent the questionnaire back. Out of a great number of findings prominence must be given to the fact that independent of the diagnosis some therapeutical elements got especially high ratings: close interpersonal contacts, individual psychotherapy and efforts toward rehabilitation. The same could be found for therapeutical elements that were considered less helpful with regard to improvement of complaints and symptoms: somatic therapies, group-psychotherapy, talks with nurses and therapeutical activities that require autonomy as well as continuous collaboration. Differences between the diagnostic subgroups concerning the given ratings are discussed. In consideration of the so far published literature it is attempted to assess the significance of this study's main results in regard to treatment of patients with depressive disorders.","2623":"The necessity and the problems of external supervision in psychiatry are explained. Therefore important aspects of the current discussion are reported, especially questions of conception and definition. External supervision that is professional help by persons with institutional independence. Not least in this way it is possible to consider the level of personal and individual relationship in clinical teams while problems of co-operation and effectiveness should be solved. This is a special style to improve quality in team-work. Some possibilities of those supervisions are mentioned. In this context experiences of the own hospital are presented.","2624":"In this article the supervision of psychiatric therapy teams is conceptualised within the overall framework of psychoanalytical theory and practice. Supervision can be interpreted as a process in the course of which there are scenic representations of unconscious conflict situations within the group of the team. These conflicts derive their dynamics from two different sources. On the one hand, we have a reflection of the therapeutic relationship between the team and the patient in the mutual relations between the team members themselves (this perspective has been adopted from the Balint group concept). On the other hand, we have, when discussing the case of a patient, a reversal of this perspective in so far as this discussion reflects the themes and conflicts originating from the professional socialisation of the team members. In this manner, supervision develops into a dialectic process that mutually interrelates these two poles of what goes on in the subconscious mind. This concept of supervision is demonstrated in detail by means of two case examples.","2625":"The documentation of restraints in a psychiatric hospital was examined over the period of a year as regards frequency and duration of restraints as well as the reasons for them. Based upon this statistical evaluation, the conditions which lead to the use of force in psychiatry are discussed in general, taking into account disease-related causes and--above all--institutional and environmental factors as well as causes related to interaction. Final considerations investigate if and how an increase in staff and concrete support for the everyday running of a ward can diminish the potential for violence, thus rendering restraints unnecessary as far as possible.","2626":"This study of aggressive behaviour of patients towards staff was conducted simultaneously for one year at four psychiatric hospitals. Until now there has been very little empirical research carried out in German speaking countries of aggression in psychiatric hospitals; the reasons for that are discussed. The results of the study are compared with findings from the prevalently american literature. Since conflicts between patients and staff precede aggressive incidents in the majority of cases, it is concluded as a practical consequence to train especially the younger staff members, who are primarily concerned, in managing such conflicts. Special importance is attached to knowledge of prior aggressive behaviour and its attending conditions.","2627":"Several observations made by the author in everyday practice during his activity as a supervisor of psychiatric therapy teams, are described. These can be classified as \"subcultural phenomena\". It is shown how the members of a therapy team will modify certain institutional conditions and parameters unconsciously but purposefully and make use of them for coping with conflict situations. This is demonstrated, inter alia, by the manner in which the duty schedule is handled and how the team deals with the sickness of a team member. This type of conflict management is then placed in relation to two major conflict potentials that come into play during everyday work in a psychiatric hospital: on the one hand, the pathogenic relationship offers made by the mentally ill patients, and on the other hand the adaptation strategies acquired during professional and institutional socialisation and moored in the conscious depths of the team member's soul. These adaptation strategies are interpreted by the team members as components of their professional identity. The therapeutic quality of an institution can thus be measured by the extent to which that institution succeeds in supporting these adaptive elements of its members and hence in relieving them of some of the mental stress to which they are exposed.","2628":"A comprehensive analysis of the organization and personal setup was conducted at the Hans-Prinzhorn Clinic in Hemer, West Germany, from July to September 1989 after appropriate preparations that had taken about 12 months. The investigation method and the results are described. Besides the results themselves, planning and execution of this systematic study are significant in shaping the future development of this clinic. Later, and independent of our analysis, the Federal German Government promulgated a special regulation governing the setup of personal engaged in psychiatry, on 18 December 1990. The results of this regulation are compared with those obtained at our clinic. The results are practically always comparable or similar. Hence, minimum staff requirements in inpatient psychiatry were found to be near-identical as assessed by methodically different and independent analysis conducted at different times.","2629":"This is a report on the frequency of somatic diseases in patients treated in regional psychiatric units (14471 courses of treatment). In 33.2% of all episodes (n = 4803) the psychiatrist diagnosed a somatic illness which was classified according to ICD-9. Most frequently quoted were diseases of the heart and the circulatory system (8.43% of all episodes), the nervous system (5.30%) and metabolic and endocrine disorders (5.17%). Distinct correlations between the rate of somatic morbidity and the variables age, sex and psychiatric diagnosis were found. In 4.04% of all episodes (n = 583) patients had to be transferred in a nonpsychiatric unit. 190 deaths were recorded, 18 of them in patients below the age of 65 years. The findings of this study show that hospitalized psychiatric patients are in need not only of psychiatric but also of medical care. A corroboration of this conclusion by further data is desirable.","2630":"Misplacement of the old in psychiatry gains in special importance based on the absolute and relative increase of this population. 117 patients have been announced for admission to the psychogeriatric department of the Zwiefalten State Mental Hospital within six months. Admission of 47 patients did not happen mostly as the result of advising the announcing person or refusing because of pure social indication. The remaining 70 patients and further 16 emergency patients have been admitted to the department of them about two thirds with cerebro-organic syndromes and one third with other mental diseases in old age. Mostly family doctors organized the hospitalisation, psychiatrists have been rarely engaged. In spite of severe reasons for hospitalisation, clinical treatment of patients with cerebro-organic syndromes turned out to be avoidable in more of the half of the cases, whereas it was justified in nearly 80% of the patients with other mental diseases in old age. As a whole, approximately the half of our admitted old patients would have not needed clinical treatment if there would exist enough qualified social care facilities, information deficits of the family doctors could be removed, and if psychiatrists would engage more in the treatment of mentally ill old persons.","2631":"All patients admitted to the Frankfurt Psychiatric Clinic suffering from organic psycho-syndromes were studied in a transversal survey. It was intended to evaluate the importance of clinical treatment within the psychiatric care system of a major city including various aspects of the diseases, psychosociological determinants and the continuation of service for these patients following clinical treatment. For the transversal survey a questionnaire was developed to record the psychopathological syndrome on admission, the order to referring patients to the clinic, outcome of treatment and service following clinical care. Patients suffering from organic psycho-syndromes represent a small quota of 4.2% according to the total admission rate. Within the group of elderly patients over 65 years of age it is remarkable that more cases with an affective psychosis were admitted than with organic psycho-syndromes. This small group of patients is in regard to interdisciplinary diagnostical and therapeutical proposals according to a high rate of multiple morbidity of distinct importance. The results of the presented study indicate the necessity to intensify the efforts of cooperation of psychiatric clinic, nursing homes and ambulatory care services for elderly patients with organic psycho-syndromes.","2632":"The population of Vienna is relatively old. The structure of care and support for aged patients is described. The relative share of aged patients in all admissions to the large mental hospital is smaller than their share in total population. Reduction in the number of in-patients also included the group of patients over 65 years. The task force \"Ubergangspflege\" (i.e.: transitional nursing) prepares and supports the deinstitutionalization of recently admitted and of long-stay patients. Utilization of a regionalized out-patients psychiatric department shows differences between the age group 60-80 years and the group over 80 years.","2633":"Some practical suggestions for the examination and treatment of patients with organic mental disorders are derived from the experience gathered in a special outpatient clinic. They refer to methods of obtaining necessary information, to the use of diagnostic criteria, and to the therapeutic possibilities in irreversible dementia.","2634":"This article reflects the experience of several years in the treatment of long-term hospitalized chronic psychotic patients. The point of view is psychoanalytic; the background is given by the modern Ego Psychology in the meaning of Blanck and Blanck and the Object-relations Theory in the Kernberg version. Special remarks are made on the phenomenon of regression.","2635":"Psychotherapy is generally believed to be insight-oriented, and functional psychoses to be incurable and inaccessible for a psychotherapeutic approach. The present paper demonstrates through a concrete example that even a severe and chronic schizophrenia can be cured with special psychotherapeutic means. Such an attempt may seem unending, troublesome, and laborious, but by setting adequate goals, such an attempt is often very successful and therefore rewarding. A modern theoretical framework of psychiatric illness and a corresponding treatment approach are described.","2636":null,"2637":"103 patients who were in a psychopathologically relatively stable condition and under long-term psycho-pharmacological treatment on an outpatient basis, were questioned on sexual functional disorders and changes in sexual behaviour, basing on a semistructured interview. This is of particular importance with regard to compliance problems in long-term therapy. 50% of the patients stated that there had been changes from the beginning of the psychiatric disorders, mostly as functional sexual disorders (42%). Multifactorial causes were presumed in most of the cases; the medication was thought to be solely responsible in only 15% of all the cases (expert rating). Schizophrenic patients under neuroleptic treatment were most frequently affected by functional disturbances. In some of the patients of the total random sample (36 patients) medication was changed under experimental conditions for a period of four weeks. Improvement of the sexual function was most frequently stated whenever a medication was given with a reduced dosage; however, the examined partial random sample is very small.","2638":"In treatment of in-patients with chronic neurotic disorders we tried both to reduce distress in the therapeutic team (doctors, nurses, other therapists) as usually caused by those patients, and to improve outcome of treatment. Therefore, three to five guidelines on how to deal with the patient were given to the therapeutic team, and illustrated by possible literal statements to the patient. The guidelines aimed at a general interactional approach to the patient and did not determine specific therapeutic interventions. They were set up following principles of Brief Therapy as developed at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto. Results of our intervention in treatment of ten patients are reported. The therapeutic team rated the guidelines generally as positive. The therapeutic outcome varied greatly. A comparison with a matched pair control group showed a favourable tendency. Initial ratings by the team of the prescriptions predicted eventual improvement of the patients.","2639":"","2640":"In the cause of an historical study dealing with the closing of an ancient psychiatric hospital in Luebeck during the 2nd world war the infrafamilial structures of the deported patients were explored. Among 136 clinical reports 42 cases were found in which families succeeded to get into contact with deported patients, in three cases their efforts to have them discharged were successful. Stress was laid on the exploration of 12 relatives of deported or murdered psychiatric patients. The interviews were structured following the \"oral history\" concept and psychological interpretation was added. Focussing on infrafamiliar coping processes which were developed facing the NS-propaganda it was found that working-class people tended to see the victim in an idealized role. They showed a strong projective defence remembering Psychiatry as an integral part of nazi-system. Others saw their relatives as victims of war in general. Some of the relatives tried to repress the existence of surviving patients for a long time, a smaller group clinged to the idea of Euthanasia. Remarkable were the deep effects of eugenic nazi-propaganda on the following generation. The national socialistic violence concerning their fathers or mothers was often a total \"tabu\" and they nowadays still fear to get into contact with Psychiatry being aware of \"suffering\" from the same \"bad blood\" as their murdered relatives. Dealing with patients' resistance to therapeutic efforts in gerontopsychiatric wards their heritage of the nazi ear should be taken into account.","2641":"The study explains, from an academic and psychiatric point of view, the need of qualitative research in the field of self-perception when suffering from an psychosis. It compares illness concepts and the subjective assessment (diagnosis) voiced by patients, their close relatives and the responsible medical staff. Surprising conclusions, which are carefully discussed, are the result of the study. When looking at future research on this issue, the need of stronger consideration of psychotic matters and the biographical as well as institutionalised context becomes obvious.","2642":"Therapeutical groups for relatives of psychiatric patients meanwhile are obligatory within strategies of psychiatric treatment. Up to a now most of the recent investigations refer to relatives of patients suffering from schizophrenia. The following article deleniates experiences with a therapeutic group for relatives of psychiatric patients suffering from different diseases, during their treatment in a psychiatric hospital in Northern Germany.","2643":"This is a report on a mental hospital--or, rather, a department of a mental hospital--called \"Waldheim\", (literal meaning: \"hostal, or home in the woods\") which is a section of the mental hospital at Hochweitzschen in Saxony in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Public opinion had been aroused some time ago by an article published in the German weekly \"Stern\" in which it was stated that psychotic patients were being subjected to leukotomy or stereotactic surgery, and that castration by x-ray treatment was being performed in mentally handicapped women, in that hospital. The article prompted the then Ministery of Health of the GDR to constitute an \"expert committee\" to investigate into the matter. The magazine's allegations were partly confirmed by the committee. The GDR parliament then constituted a \"special parliamentary commission\" for another inquiry. Again several allegations were confirmed. It was stated that the events and actions in that hospital had been unsatisfactorily assessed and digested. The authors undertake to make the procedures followed by the medical and nursing staff, accessible to a wider public and to render them more lucid. Important structural characteristics of the patterns that developed there, were the governmentally prescribed segregation of severely diseased persons to \"treat\" them far away from their residential community, the absence of a critical general public, and the amalgamation of supervisory institutions with those that require to be supervised.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2644":"","2645":"We tried to improve the compliance in the long-term treatment of schizophrenic patients by psychoeducational groups for relatives of 48 patients over the course of six months. More than 90% of the relatives requested mainly informations concerning the illness and its treatment both at the beginning and at the end of the group sessions. At the beginning only 33% of the relatives thought they could benefit from sharing their experiences with others, afterwards this rate rose to 67%. At first, 49% believed to understand the nature of schizophrenia, at the end this rate was 86%. The importance of medication implying certain side effects was accepted by about 85% before and afterwards. This good quota at the beginning of the group sessions can be explained of this high acceptance rate appears to be a direct result of the group meetings.","2646":"The study presented herewith is part of a more comprehensive research work dealing mainly with the de-hospitalisation of the psychiatric hospital San Clemente in Venice since the change in psychiatric care effected by law, and with analysing the present situation of psychiatric care. The article reports on the highlights of this study during the investigated period from 1978 to 1984. The different types of care implemented in Venice are described on a structural plane with reporting on relevant data describing the activities. The importance of the centro di salute mentale = CSM within the Italian psychiatric care scheme is emphasised. Emptying of the psychiatric hospital San Clemente in Venice between 1978 and 1984 was observed systematically. The results show that the decrease in the number of patients of the psychiatric hospital during the period under observation was mainly achieved by genuine discharges. The majority of discharge patients (62%) return to their families, occupy a flat of their own or in residential community with other ex-patients. Transfers to other institutions were effected in exceptional cases only (e.g. home for the blind) (total percentage 4%). Analyses of the quality of life shows the limitations of reintegration of ex-patients. Only few ex-patients have so far succeeded in building up a perceptive for the future: the most marked time dimension is the past. Contrary to the often-lamented neglect of patients after their discharge, our data show that almost 90% of all 138 discharged ex-patients whom we interviewed, have been maintaining contacts to the psychiatric service offices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2647":"Since the early seventies numerous reports, especially from the Scandinavian countries, have indicated a growing incidence of organic brain syndromes after chronic exposure to mixtures of organic solvents. Symptomatology varies widely, but from a psychiatric point of view can best be summarized as: dementia syndromes with cognitive and neurological deficits, neurasthenic and neurotic syndromes. Presenting a single case study the authors describe a dementia syndrome after long-term exposure to organic solvents: from certain areas of work a high index of suspicion seems justified.","2648":"In 1988 two patients intoxicated with scopolamine were treated in the department of psychiatry. Clinically an acute paranoid-hallucinatory psychosis was to be observed. Similar cases were reported from other parts of the country, partly proved by toxicological findings. In the cases seen by us scopolamine was applicated secretly in drinks and food with criminal intention. Diagnostic, therapeutic and historical aspects of intoxication with scopolamine are discussed.","2649":"Carbamacepine is an effective drug in the treatment of acute manic states as well as in preventing relapses in the course of manic-depressive illness. Many controlled studies show that carbamacepine is a valuable alternative and an implementation to the existing methods of treatment. Treatment of acute mania can be more rapid, more specific of carbamacepine is used or combined with neuroleptics (or occasionally with lithium). There are less side effects in carbamacepine treatment than in conventional treatment. In relapse prevention carbamacepine is probably as effective as in lithium. The essential progress of using carbamacepine is given, because more patients are eligible for a regime of relapse prevention: Patients that have proven resistant to lithium treatment and patients with contraindications to lithium. Carbamacepine treatment presents an important breakthrough in Rapid Cycling Affective Psychoses. Here it may be superior to all other methods of treatment.","2650":"In the management of schizophrenic psychoses, drug medication with neuroleptics occupies a central position and is in fact a first-choice treatment. The considerable side effects and late sequelae of this treatment are known to impair the quality of life of the patient and have comne to the fore once again in recent years as the starting points of controversial discussions among specialists and among those who are engaged in matters concerning psychiatric policies or \"politics\". The cornerstones of this debate are demonstrated and explained on the basis of the present clinico-psychiatric state of research in respect of effectivity predictors, types of mechanisms of action. Long-term courses of treatment with neuroleptics, and different dosage schedule strategies.","2651":"The problems of subjective acceptance and reaction by the patients to the effects produced by neuroleptics, have been receiving far more less attention so far than the \"objective\" aspects, and have not yet been empirically tested to the same extent. However, papers have been published recently in connection with this complex within the framework of researches into concept of disease and into compliance. These papers supply proof of the tremendous significance of the patient's attitude to, and assessment of, pharmacotherapeutic measures. The following aspects are pointed out to be particularly important: The attitude and relation of the patient to his psychosis; the style of coping in the sense of integration or disintegration of the psychosis into the process of life; the dysphoric reactions to neuroleptics; and the disease pattern or disease model. Practical model examples are given to illustrate three possibilities of a more intensive connection between neuroleptic therapy and other therapeutic measures.","2652":"In social psychiatry crisis and crisis intervention do not have a uniform nomenclature. However, the number of institutes which offer in-patient crisis intervention as a specific treatment is growing. Therefore, on the way from the pilot project to the standardized method, the question of indications becomes increasingly important. On the basis of indications we have evaluated our practical experience with 1086 patients in a Berlin crisis intervention center in a retrospective study. The results present our estimation of the range of indications of this specific treatment. In the following article it will be explained and brought to discussion.","2653":"On the basis of changes that occurred in Vienna, the implications of planned interventions into the total structure of the institutional psychiatric care is being investigated. By a simultaneous and concerted action in that 1.5 million city, the in-patient and out-patient areas have, with the aid of predefined goals, been regionalized and much improved in terms of equipment. The number of patients in the large mental hospitals dropped by 68.5 percent between 1976 and 1988. The new out-patient facilities were made use of by 1.09 percent of the population from 1980 to 1987. No serious negative developments have been recorded. The study shows that the defined goals have to a large extent been achieved. In spite of the evident backlog demand, the total costs of the institutional psychiatric care did not rise as much as the costs of the general in-patient medical care over the same period of time. Changes in psychiatric care are measurable, the influence of the institutions on \"patient carriers\" justifies the interest in care research.","2654":"The de-institutionalization of psychiatric hospitals in the United States of America has resulted in the increasing use of psychiatric emergency services at the First Aid posts of General hospitals. Out-reaching psychiatric emergency services have existed in parts of Europe already for some time and were instituted in Amsterdam (The Netherlands), for instance, as long ago as 1930. The principles and practice of this kind of service, together with some basic figures, are presented, in order to spotlight the fact that such out-reaching services are of vital importance for the successful shift from hospital-based psychiatric care to community mental health care.","2655":"In 1977 the state parliament of Berne took the decision to reform the existing psychiatric health care. decentralized, community oriented institutions were to be established with the aim of preventing secondary disabilities due to psychiatric illness, and of enhancing or instigating rehabilitative measures. 4 different psychiatric services based in general hospitals were installed. The present report presents an analysis of statistical data collected during the first 5 years on one of these services. We found a linear increase of admission which appears to be due to several factors: demand, image, manpower, cooperation with other institutions, breadth of the offered service. Furthermore, the distance between the institution and the place of living proved to be an important factor influencing the incidence of psychiatric treatment and the degree of cooperation with other care services--this aspect being consistent with the arguments for a decentralization of care. The degree of consistency in the distribution of diagnoses and the changes of treatment was surprising: an average of 50% of our patients were referred on an out-patient basis, approx. 40% by general hospital wards, 16% remain under the care of the general hospital. Our statistical analysis shows that in an average of 61% of the cases in which a referral to a psychiatric hospital was discussed, this measure could be avoided (although there is a certain degree of subjectivity in this judgement). The psychiatric service does not appear to compete with private practice care: 44% of the patients are referred to general practitioners and practing psychiatrists for after care, while only half as many are referred from private practices.","2656":"155 people who had left East-Germany and sought psychiatric help within six weeks after their arrival in West Berlin, were examined. History, living situation and psychopathological symptoms were studied. The disorders were diagnosed according to ICD-9 and DSM-III-R. 85% of the patients reported that they had already suffered from similar complaints in East Germany. 50% stated they have had symptoms before they had made the decision to leave. On average, that decision had been taken 22 months before the actual leaving. Most often patients complained about sleep disturbance, nervousness, and headaches. According to ICD-9, 55% of the disorders were classified as reactive and 39% as neurotic or personality disorders. The most frequent diagnoses according to DSM-III-R were adjustment disorders (41%), major depression (21%), anxiety disorders (16%), and dysthymia (14%). Regardless of diagnosis most patients were found to have symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with vegetative complaints. There were no clear relationships between psychopathological symptoms and data of history or present living situation.","2657":"Borderline-patients compose a group of severe problem-patients on psychiatric inpatient units. Among other topics this concerns the difficult differential diagnosis, attitudes of demandingness and entitlement, feelings of depressive despair, acting out and impulsive behavior. Using a process oriented diagnostical approach which includes the behavior of the patient on the unit and the analysis of the therapeutic interaction, the borderline disorder is differentiated from the psychoses on the one side and the neuroses on the other. The specific treatment problems of borderline-patients are dealt with under the headings of regression, splitting, projective identification and acting out. The counter-transference problems of treatment teams are taken under special consideration. The last part of the article deals with treatment goals and therapeutic strategies in the psychiatric inpatient treatment of borderline patients and discusses possible modalities of adjunctive treatment.","2658":"The present study examines the building up of art classes in psychiatric hospitals in the thirties and forties of this century. Until 1950 the worldwide total of 34 art classes had come into being. The growing psychiatric interest in drawings of patients in the 19th century is related to changes in psychiatric theory moving from \"moral treatment\" to descriptive psychiatry at the turn of the century. All in all the installation of 11 artistic workshops for patients can be traced before the 1st world war. They were part of work therapy in german private clinics as a means to put patients of a higher social standing to a regular activity instead of field and garden work, which was medically indicated but socially unacceptable. During the course of development of a diagnostic interest since 1870 the drawings were all along considered to be the immediate expression of the patients inner world. Such a view had become possible, after in modern art the conceptions about the meaning of art had changed. Paradigmatically this connection can be shown in the work of Prinzhorn. First therapeutic attempts were then started by different psychoanalysts especially in the treatment of children. These formed an important basis for the establishment of art classes in psychiatric hospitals later on. Painting was now considered as a means to approach the hidden unconscious. The study continues to explain in which way the therapeutic applications of art therapy depended on the convergence of view points in esthetic and therapeutic theory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2659":"A relatively wide acceptance of neuroleptic depot medication was seen among the patients of a large psychiatric hospital on the occasion of a survey conducted on a randomly chosen day. Patients described their experience of undesirable side effects. A basic common trait of disturbances of the feeling tone caused by depot neuroleptics was the simultaneous occurrence of conflicting emotions. Complaints by patients treated with depot neuroleptics about undesirable side effects can thus be better differentiated from their experience of the underlying psychotic disease and certain forms of experience that are typical of the personality concerned.","2660":"","2661":"In 65% of the rehabilitation wards on Bavarian psychiatric hospitals, medication is not distributed by nurses but is collected by the patients in the nurses' room. For 159 patients, data on their reliability in this procedure were obtained. Patients generally come for their medication with considerable reliability. Patients suffering from schizophrenia were unreliable during the first week of treatment. During the last week of treatment, however, their reliability improved. The improvement of reliability was high for patients of higher education, productive psychotic symptoms at the beginning of the treatment, good response to neuroleptic medication, or first manifestation of the disease. The system of patients coming for their medication is a method of training self-responsible medication intake. The reliability of the patients' participation can be interpreted as a measure of their compliance.","2662":"Using a questionnaire the therapists of the Psychiatric Hospital in Ravensburg Weissenau were requested for information on the suicidality and symptomato-logy of their patients. This was done to assess the acute and chronic suicidality prevalent in a psychiatric hospital. The number of acute and chronic suicidal patients, the prevalence of self-destructive behaviour (38%) as well as the fact that 75% of the 475 assessed patients belonged to diagnostic groups with an imminent high risk of suicidality, show the high \"basic suicidality\" that therapists of a psychiatric hospital to deal with: 7% of the assessed patients were acutely, 11% chronically and 22% possibly suicidal; 38% had had suicidal episodes at least once in their life. The rate of suicidality was highest among patients with affective psychoses followed by those with personality disorders, neurotic disorders and depressive syndromes.","2663":"In the framework of a prospective follow-up study, development and outcome of the occupational and social status in 258 first-admission psychiatric patients was investigated. Interviews were made at the time of discharge, 1 year and 5 years later. For that reason prospective data exist on the prehospital and hospital time as well as on short-term and long-term course. Social adjustment, occupational rehabilitation, early retirement, social status and pre- and post-hospital occupational integration were investigated. It must be placed on record, that psychiatric patients are subjected to severe negative changes in their occupational and social life even after the first hospital treatment. Type and quantity of disintegration depended on the diagnostic group. Schizophrenic patients differed from the other patients in every intergration area.","2664":"Psychopathological analysis of the patterns of symptoms in 176 depressive in-patients disclosed in 73.3% of all patients the presence of anxiety symptoms: of these, 38.6% merely had diffuse anxiety, whereas 34.7% showed either additionally or alone specific anxiety symptoms such as phobias and panic attacks. Similar to the results obtained by dividing the patients into an \"endogenous\" and \"neurotic\" group, namely, that there was no difference between the subtypes in respect of triggering the depressive episodes by life events, or in respect of the suicide rate 30 months after discharge and in respect of a chronic course developing during the 2 years following the discharge, there was likewise no difference with regard to these criteria if the patients were subdivided into depressive patients without anxiety and those with anxiety symptoms. However, a subdivision of the depressive patients with anxiety symptoms into a group having only free-floating anxiety and a group with specific anxiety symptoms, resulted in a clear association with these criteria: If a phobia or panic attacks were present, triggering by life events was far more frequent than if there was only free-floating was more often chronic in the first group, but there was no difference in suicidality. The results indicate that it will be necessary to provide for a more differentiated classification of anxiety symptoms before deciding in clinical routine what steps to take wherever depression and anxiety symptoms are present side by side. The same applies to treatment studies.","2665":"With the reform of psychiatric and psychosocial care services, new professional groups, apart from the traditionally medical professions, have increasingly found their way into everyday therapy. Social workers in particular have gained significance in complementary fields of treatment. An empirical survey of the everyday situation in a comprehensive community mental health service system focusing on the therapist-couple \"physician\" and \"social worker\" collaborating to guarantee continuity of care for long-term treatment, yielded three results: 1. The dual-therapistsystem was convincingly effective for nearly half of the total number of patients; the other patients were attended generally by one therapist, while the second therapist took an active part in treatment only sporadically. 2. Analysis considering the two professional groups involved showed a significant pre-dominance of the physicians, both on a qualitative basis in their function as being the primary therapist as well as in strictly quantitative terms concerning the relations of all therapeutic activities. 3. A comparison of two extreme groups \"doctor-patients\" and \"social worker-patient\" revealed significant differences in features of their respective social and clinical case histories. In the course of treatment we found a rapid focusing on and acceptance of the medical therapeut. These results, which also reflect the conflict between social psychiatric claims and everyday reality, are discussed with regard to the self-perception of the professional groups involved and the practice of our department and the cooperative institutions, as well as the expectations of the patients and their relatives, and finally with reference to the various exclusively medical-oriented treatment models which still dominate contemporary psychiatric praxis.","2666":"A mobile child and youth psychiatric service is presented that concerned with the mental health care of a county with a population of 239,000 inhabitants. This kind of service was conceived especially to meet the demands of rural regions which are high, as empirical investigations about administrative and real prevalence have shown. The hypothesis that child and youth psychiatric or other specialized institutions create demands not normally existing, could be refuted. The service proved to be an efficient model for mental health care in rural regions so that it can be looked upon--especially in areas which are not sufficiently provided with child psychiatric institutions--as a fully valid alternative to other kinds of mental health services. Still, there is the problem of financing, which is not yet completely solved. A standardized regulation for the whole Federal Republic is suggested with the participation of the health insurance funds.","2667":"Repeated partial sleep deprivation (in the second half of the night) is investigated in respect of therapeutic effectivity as part of antidepressive treatment. 31 inpatients suffering from endogenous depression were subjected to walking therapy three times at intervals of one week. The antidepressive efficacy of sleep deprivation is individually (both interindividually and intraindividually) very different. Regular response is rare, but so is repeated non-response. Even if one or several waking therapies remain ineffective, further attempts can eventually result in marked antidepressive effects. Hence a repetition of this antidepressive measure is indicated, the more so since it is easy to carry out and does not produce side effects. ","2668":"In the patient unit of the University Clinic for Psychiatry at Kortenberg (K.U. Leuven) Belgium and in the Psychosomatic Hospital Bad Pyrmont, which specialises in the treatment of anorexia nervosa, a great deal of attention is given to the evaluation of body image via the video-distortion technique, the video-confrontation technique and the body attitude test (a questionnaire). These different methods as well as the first findings and experiences are described.","2669":"The article presents the results of a catamnesis of patients (both female and male) who had been in-patients for the first time between 1972 and 1978 because of signs and symptoms of schizophrenic diseases and who were between 14 and 18 years of age. For 51 patients data were available on long-term follow-up for at least 5 years. Compared with the available catamneses of adults of the 'seventies, the proportion of chronic cases is greater among the adolescents. The patterns of signs and symptoms do not differ significantly from each other. In addition, it was found that the treatment chain had many weak links despite an improvement due to the setting up of child psychiatry and juvenile psychiatric wards; in other words, treatment was mostly discontinuous and not adapted to long-term course of the disease.","2670":"Some findings reported in literature suggest a reversal of sex-specific role behavior in schizophrenic patients. To test this hypothesis, a secondary analysis of the psychopathological status documented in the charts of first admitted schizophrenic patients was carried out. The patients came from a defined geographical region. Operationalized diagnostic criteria were applied. The influence of confounding variables was controlled. Our findings do not support the hypothesized sex-specific role enactment reversal. Schizophrenic men and women showed far more similarities than differences which were, contrary to our expectations, in agreement with general sex-dependent behavioral patterns and in no way specific for schizophrenia.","2671":"We studied the influence of rehabilitation in flat-sharing communities, or communes, on the duration of hospitalisation of 158 chronic psychiatric patients. Variables that shorten the length of hospital stay most effectively, were also investigated. The study covered a period of 13.5 years. The average residence in a commune is four years (mean) or two years (median), respectively. The length of further hospitalisation was reduced by more than fourfold (mean) or by more than twelvefold (median) respectively in comparison to the duration of hospitalisation before entry into a commune. 11 of the 18 variables investigated had a shortening effect on the further duration of hospitalisation. The influence of work performance on the duration of hospitalisation is studied.","2672":"The article reviews the presently available spectrum of work offered to mental patients outside a psychiatric hospital. Various forms of occupation are studied; one of the points of emphasis deals with the recently founded commercial establishments employing mental patients, describing their characteristic features and financing conditions. A quantitative survey of the distribution of these companies is also given.","2673":"Experiences, goals and results obtained with the \"Mannheimer Starthilfe-Project\" over five years (1983-1988) regarding on-the-job vocational rehabilitation for mentally impaired persons are presented. In an aftercare programme 350 patients (mainly suffering from psychotic disorders) have so far been referred to 68 on-the-job vocational placements in 42 local establishments (industrial and municipal).","2674":"The question as to whether psychiatric units in district general hospitals can replace the existing large mental hospitals, is still controversial. Recently, this issue was discussed in a governmental report on the reform of the psychiatric services in the Federal Republic of Germany. It has been shown by the example of the community-orientated comprehensive mental health care system of the city of Offenbach, that a psychiatric unit of 80 beds is capable of handling and managing the district responsibilities of a defined area of 110.000 inhabitants, provided qualified and sufficient complementary and outpatient service facilities are available, especially for the chronically ill patients and their families.","2675":"After a short introduction to the topic of psychiatric evaluation research and the problems of vocational reintegration of psychiatric patients the article reviews the latest development in research on vocational integration. The analysis of literature scrutinizes the significance of different predictors concerning sociodemographic status, vocational aspects, status and treatment of mental illness and social relations. The various results are integrated and conclusions for the practice of vocational rehabilitation and further investigation are drawn.","2676":"In a crossectional investigation based on a group of 122 patients with panic attacks, compiled from a variety of hospitals and therapy institutions, 97 patients were found to be suffering from panic disorder as a relevant medical problem. The disease, however, is often identified in an unsatisfactory manner. Avoidance behaviour (extensive or limited) associated with a severe form of panic disorder, was evident in more than one-half of the group (60%). In these patients the incidence of panic attacks is higher, anxiety is more marked, and there are more often additional anxiety disorders (generalised anxiety, sociophobia). These results underline the importance of early recognition and specific treatment of panic disorder to prevent development of avoidance behaviour.","2677":"Paroxysmal states of anxiety that cannot be traced back to somatic causes have been called panic attacks since the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III) of the American Psychiatric Association. This term has since been accepted as part of psychiatric everyday language in many countries. The present review discusses initially the diagnostic and differential diagnostic aspects against the background of nosological classifications as practised to date, with particular emphasis on the requirements of the practising psychiatrist. The authors of this review hold the opinion that whereas the phenomenon of panic attack is a valid concept, the conceptualisation of a panic disorder is still largely hypothetical. The often observed \"natural history\"--after panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, coupling of attacks to certain situations, avoidance of these situations, as well as agoraphobia, depressivity, self-medication with tranquilisers and alcohol, hypochondriacal fears with increased consultation of doctors, and family conflicts may develop--requires early therapeutic intervention. Hence, the second part of this article presents the pharmacological and psychotherapeutical treatment methods for panic attacks and their complications as developed and successfully tried out during the past few years. The efficacy has been proven of drug therapy on the one hand of prophylactic treatment using tricyclic antidepressives, MAO-inhibitors and alprazolam or clonazepam, and on the other hand also of a non-continuous attack-related treatment strategy. Of the more recent psychotherapeutic methods, relaxation methods and the cognitive treatment of panic attacks are discussed. This direct focus on panic attacks seems to be more promising than the conventional treatment methods centered on secondary symptoms such as anticipatory anxiety or agoraphobia.","2678":"The definition of a separate nosological entity \"panic disorder\" in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd revision (DSM III) of the American Psychiatric Association triggered a flood of empirical research into this disorder. In this article the literature is surveyed to find out to what extent panic attacks and panic disorder bear specific relationships to measurable variables from the psychosocial and biological spheres. The investigated psychosocial variables are: experiences of separation in childhood; separation anxieties in childhood; sociodemographic correlates as they are known from epidemiological studies; personality factors; life events as possible triggering events of periods with panic attacks; and, finally, socalled \"cognitive correlates\". The results obtained in this field are just as inhomogeneous as they continue to be in the sphere of biological variables. Of these, the following factors are discussed: genetic factors; neurological and psycho-physiological correlates; the problem of mitral valve prolapse; endocrinal correlates and neurotransmitters. Present findings do not supply conclusive evidence either for or against separation of panic attacks from free-floating anxiety. The relationship between panic attacks and depressive disorders is equally unclear if judged on the basis of the results from empirical research which are far from uniform.","2679":"On the point of anxiety states, behavioural sciences have only recently been provided with sufficient operational definitions of clinical concepts to enable us to start working on the construction of valid models for the different disorders. Panic attacks are defined as attacks manifested by discrete periods of apprehension or fear, concomitant with at least four marked vegetative sensations, as described in the DSM-III. Several interventions have proved to be able to mimic experimentally such episodes in vulnerable patients, providing the researcher with valuable models for panic research such as the lactate infusion technique, the single CO2 inhalation model and, to a lesser extent, the hyperventilation provocationtest. The study of these models may be a major contribution to a better understanding of panic anxiety, both from a biological and behavioural point of view. Biological observations of those models point to pH changes and ionic shifts as a physiological concomitant in the genesis of experimentally induced panic, and suggests that hypersensitive chemoreceptive structures of the CNS may be implicated. As to the behavioural aspects of the models, there is strong evidence for the ancient phobophobia, or \"fear of fear\" idea, which may explain the invaldating recurrence of panic attacks.","2680":"Patients suffering from cardiac phobia or neurocirculatory asthenia (also known as cardiac neurosis or effort syndrome) represent a uniform disease group due to the typicality of the signs and symptoms and of the course of the disease; this group should be distinguished from the broad spectrum of cardiovascular disorders. There is close agreement with panic disorder according to DSM III, one of the reasons being that cardiac phobia was originally the model pattern for defining that disorder. In the present prospective study the significance of psychosocial and clinical factors for the prediction of the further course of the disease was studied in 36 patients with cardiac phobia treated on an inpatient basis for the first time, 29 of whom could be followed up by a checkup 2 1\/2 years later. The duration of the disease before treatment, as well as difficulties in various social spheres, especially in partnership problems, were found to be variables exercising a particularly strong influence on the course of illness. The variables concerning the marital status and school education were also found to be statistically relevant predictors. Familial stress and the appeal-for-help behaviour of these patients were also recorded. The results of the study point to the importance of psychosocial factors as major coursemodifying factors and underline the need to pay particular attention to this part of the treatment.","2681":"The currently available empirical findings lead us to assume that various forms of anxiety disorders--such as generalised anxiety syndrome or panic disorder--are based on different pathophysiological mechanisms with varying involvement of different neurotransmitter systems. We must bear in mind that whereas the disturbance of a transmitter may predominate--such as the disturbance of the noradrenalin system in panic disorder and that of the GABA-ergen system in generalised anxiety--on the other hand the transmitter systems are mutually interlinked, so that an isolated disturbance of a system is very unlikely. However, to the present date it has not been possible to give a definite biochemical characterisation of a certain disease pattern, such as that of panic disorder. Likewise, no unequivocal conclusions can be drawn in respect of cerebral localisation. Nevertheless, results obtained in animal experiments suggest that in panic disorder certain brain areas like e.g. the locus ceruleus may be affected. Future hopes rest in developing more specific drugs that selectively change a transmitter system and on new techniques such as positron emission tomography enabling a better insight into the mode of functioning of the brain. New possibilities seem to be offered also by defining a predisposition via molecular-genetic methods.","2682":"Psychiatric foster family care of no more than two patients living in the foster family can be seen as a therapeutic setting, where longterm chronic patients can improve in their social functioning. Recent studies found the family characteristics as decisive for potential therapeutic effects. So the question arises how to select adequate foster family applicants. In an empirical study with 105 applicant-families we have tried to uncover the selection-procedures and mechanism of the foster care team that finally lead to adequate\/non-adequate distinction. The results of the study show that the differences between the two applicant groups (selected vs non selected) are not identical with the intended selection criteria of the team members. Some major differences were found in areas that were totally independent from the team-criteria: the selected-as-adequate-families had a more intensive exchange with the outside world, educated more children and were therefore assumed to be socially more competent than the not selected applicant group. So selecting foster families comes up as a complicated decision making process that goes beyond checking up some criteria.","2683":"This report on the first ten years of the independent day hospital for psychiatric patients at Siegburg, West Germany, is based on the special nature and position of the hospital within the pattern of psychiatric hospital care as is being practised in W. Germany, where such hospitals are being run with provincial (Land)government supervision and management, and also in consideration of the fact that very little concrete experience has so far been collected on the independent hospitals. Geographical and social data are described and the changes that have taken place in the psychiatric patient care system in West Germany, as well as the changes in proportionate distribution of diagnoses of the patients, are considered. Differentiation of patient groups according to the development of their strategies for psychotic and borderline patients are worked out on this basis. Hence, this type of independent day hospital ceases to be a transitory affair and has evolved a therapeutic approach of its own.","2684":"This study aimed at investigating whether psychiatric care and especially partial hospitalisation programmes would achieve a reduction in time and cost of inpatient care. Frequency and duration of hospital treatments were studied in chronic psychotic patients (mean duration of illness = 8.7 years) before and after admission to a comprehensive community care system. The system includes partial hospitalisation programmes, out-patient care and various community services. Frequency and duration of hospital treatments were found to be lowered to less than 50%. However, since there were long periods of partial hospitalisation in addition to in-patient treatment, the remaining time of out-patient care was reduced. This result can be found mainly during the first year after admission and applies in particular to elderly and particularly chronic patients. In discussing the findings, treatment costs were also considered.","2685":"In a retrospective study 80 inpatients (Sociotherapy, Therapeutic Community) were compared to 160 outpatients (80 patient Day Clinic, 80 patients Night Clinic). With a mean treatment duration of 4-5 1\/2 month a significant decrease was found for each group in the frequency and duration of further hospital admissions after end of therapy. Day and Night Clinic patients tending to a better outcome than the inpatients. Advantages of the Day and Night Clinic are seen e.g. in a higher degree of acceptance by patients and family doctors, disadvantages in the increased rate of suicide found in our sample.","2686":"How many longstay patients could be just as well served by less sheltered facilities, and what are the main reasons for staff-members to consider patients suitable for alternative care? These were the two questions of a Dutch study (1984-1985) in five mental hospitals. Both, the attending psychiatrist and one of the nurses, were asked to give an independent judgement for each of the persons of a random sample of 381 longstay patients. Some results: thirty percent of the longstay patients were judged eligible for alternative care. They were younger, less frequently diagnosed as schizophrenic, better integrated inside and outside of the mental hospital, more likely to be residents of wards with high turnover-rates, were less aggressive, and had better social skills, and shorter periods of inpatient stay. Compared with the rest of the patients no statistically significant differences were found with regard to suicidal behaviour, organic brain syndrome and formal admission status.","2687":"Based on the evaluation of case reports of 15 inpatients treated between 1971 and 1986 who had been suffering from persistent alcoholic jealousy mania for at least three years, the psychopathological characteristics of this disease are outlined to define two types of courses of the disturbance: on the one hand, the more frequent monosymptomatic form with gradual onset and on the other hand the acutely occurring jealousy mania within the frame of an alcoholic hallucinosis with additional signs of delusions and acoustic hallucinations rounding off the clinical pattern. Prognosis especially of the second, schizophreniform type of the course appears unfavourable. Organic brain performance deficits and disturbances of sexual function are seen with both types of alcoholic jealousy mania.","2688":"To date, no satisfying solution has been found to the problem of how to avoid the distressing withdrawal symptoms accompanying opiate detoxification. By administering staggered doses of naloxone to the patient while under tiapride (Delpral-R), the various discomforts were satisfactorily reduced and the detoxification syndrome could be limited to 50 hours. This study covers 15 patients who had an average addiction history of more than 7 1\/e years, and who underwent inpatient rapid opiate withdrawal treatment lasting an average of five days.","2689":"Developing differential treatments for addicts implies discrimination of clinically relevant subgroups of addicts. It is common practice to classify patients by their capability to engage in an in-patient therapy covering a period of six month on average. This rough classification offers no starting-point to optimize therapeutic strategies especially for patients with only insufficient understanding of and suffering from their disorder (so-called depraved alcoholics). They are rarely motivated to continue therapy. Most patients at the admission ward for addicts at the State Mental Hospital Weissenau belong to that group of patients. Our study enclosed 362 patients from this ward, and we used the varying disease- and treatment-careers, which differ in duration and\/or frequency to make up four subgroups of patients according to that different forms of chronicity. The groups differ in a number of social, treatment- and disease-related features. Guided by clinical practice, such a formation of subgroups can be seen as a first step in the identification of subpopulations of chronic addicted. Conclusions how to complete existing medical care and guidance-patterns can be drawn.","2690":"Benzodiazepine (BD) misuse and dependence in 80 patients, 1974-1983 undergoing withdrawal treatment, were investigated by means of case histories and catamnestic inquiries. Three fourth of the patients were women. Many of the patients suffered from disturbed matrimonial relations, and 36 lived unmarried, divorced, or widowed. Besides, among the men frequently vocational difficulties were found, which increased in the course of BD-taking. In particular after removal of Lorazepam or Bromazepam in 58 cases withdrawal symptoms appeared, among them seven times delirium and six times epileptic seizures (grand mal). Catamnestic inquiries were practicable in 51 patients. 20 of them had required no further treatment, while 18 took again BD. But only 3 still proved to be as well psychical as physical dependent, in contrast to 14 before withdrawal treatment. Among the 15 only psychical dependent patients 8 merely showed a low dose dependence. Hence BD-dependence proves to be remediable, and subsequently shows only little tendency to relapse. ","2691":"A multistage treatment model for alcoholics that is situated close to their domicile is presented in respect of organisational structure and basic therapeutic principles. Patients are compared with each other in their various stages of treatment (detoxication, counselling, therapy, aftercare) in respect of sociodemographic, alcohol-specific and psychological variables; these variables are examined with regard to their prognostic relevance for the transition to the next stage of their treatment schedule and for the success of the treatment. The resulting consequences for the treatment of alcoholics are pointed out and discussed.","2692":"Monoamine oxidase (MAO) and its subtypes MAO-A and MAO-B show different distribution in post mortem human brain areas. While MAO-B is the predominant type in glial tissue, intraneuronal MAO is either of type A (locus coeruleus, only 10% of substantia nigra neurons stain MAO-A), while raphe neurons contain entirely MAO-B. Inhibition of MAO-subtypes leads to accumulation of biogenic amines in glial tissue while there is a selective intraneuronal influence differing between various brain areas. Generation of toxic end-products (eg. aldehydes, hydrogen peroxide, ammonia) may contribute to trigger or at least to progress Parkinson's disease.","2693":"In an open study 13 depressed inpatients received moclobemide, a selective and reversible MAO-A-inhibitor (300 mg\/d) for one week and subsequently were switched to a three-week course of a tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressant (TCA) without medication-free interval. There were no drop-out, two patients needed additional ECT. Depressive symptomatology declined during treatment which was well tolerated. Mild adverse CNS effects and gastrointestinal symptoms prevailed under moclobemide. Subsequent TCA prompted autonomic symptoms. Overall adverse drug effects decreased over the treatment period. Cardiovascular monitoring revealed no clinically relevant side effects.","2694":"Moclobemide, a benzamidederivate, is a reversible, selective MAOI with a predominant effect upon MAO-A. In clinical trials with moclobemide so far no clearcut tyramine interaction leading to a hypertensive crisis has been reported and no case of hepatotoxicity has been observed. Open and double-blind studies have shown moclobemide to be an activating antidepressant whose efficacy is superior to placebo and comparable to standard tricyclics. The global tolerance has been shown to be better than in tricyclics, frequency of (anticholinergic) side effects has been lower compared to tricyclics. Our data confirmed the antidepressant efficacy of moclobemide with a rapid onset of action and activating properties devoid of clinically relevant tyramine interactions. As side-effects restlessness, paraesthesias, nausea and sleep disturbances were noted; sleep disturbances could not be improved in most cases. In the light of existing clinical data moclobemide may become an exponent of the \"renaissance\" of MAOI in the treatment of retarded depression.","2695":"During the last years the MAO-inhibitors reached a progressive importance in clinical practice. It was attempted to solve problems of tolerability by a new generation of MAO-inhibitors. Brofaromine is a MAO-inhibitor of the second generation, a selective, reversible and short acting MAO-A-inhibitor, promising that the dangerous \"cheese effect\" will occur only under extreme conditions. The clinical trials performed hitherto, among other double-blind test versus tranylcypromine and imipramine, demonstrate a good antidepressive efficacy and a good tolerability.","2696":"The MAOIs have been an underutilized and overly feared class of medical compounds potentially useful for a wide spectrum of disorders. At one end of the spectrum they have been found effective for several anxiety disorders, especially when phobic or panic reactions are part of the symptoms. At the other end of the spectrum, they are effective in patients with melancholic depressions, especially outpatients who have lack of energy, a history of bipolar disorder, or a nonresponse to conventional treatment with TCAs. However, their major role for psychiatric patients appears to be in the large heterogeneous group of ambulatory depressives who have symptoms of both anxiety and depression. The danger of side effects or toxicity associated with MAOIs has been exaggerated. Most side effects are relatively mild and are controllable by dose reduction or other supportive measures. The adverse reaction of most concern, hypertensive crisis, is great extent preventable with appropriate dietary restrictions. Selective and reversible MAOI's may have a better safety profile compared to classical MAOI's.","2697":"Monoamine oxidase (MAO) type A inhibitors are used as antidepressants. A number of drug candidates in this therapeutic class are currently being evaluated clinically. The objective of the present review is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of five MAO-A inhibitors (moclobemide, toloxatone, brofaromine, cimoxatone, amiflamine). Differences between these drugs exist in their absorption and disposition characteristics. However, a detailed comparison reveals a strong similarity between moclobemide and toloxatone (high hepatic extraction ratio; reduced oral bioavailability due to first-pass metabolism; similar binding to plasma protein, fb approximately 0.23). Elimination half-lives of 1-3 h for moclobemide and toloxatone contrast with the higher values for amiflamine (5-12 h), cimoxatone (9-16 h) and brofaromine (12-15 h). All five MAO-A inhibitors undergo complete hepatic elimination, and only a negligible fraction of the dose (less than 1%) is excreted unchanged in the urine. Oxidation represents the major degradation pathway. Results from studies in populations with increased risk factors are scarce for the discussed MAO-A inhibitors except for moclobemide. For this drug it has been shown that neither age nor reduced kidney function influence plasma levels significantly. Liver insufficiency reduces the body's elimination capacity for moclobemide. As a consequence similar doses result in higher plasma concentrations in liver impaired patients than subjects with normal hepatic function and a dose adjustment may therefore become necessary.","2698":"Two groups of depressed patients were treated either with a selective MAO-A-inhibitor, moclobemide (n = 13), or a tetracyclic antidepressant, maprotiline (n = 18), in a 28 days lasting investigation. Before and after treatment psychopathologic symptoms were rated using Hamilton Depression Scale, motor performance were proven by the Motorische Leistungs-Serie (MLS), and acoustic and visual sensorimotor performance were investigated using Bettendorff Reaktiometer T96. Deterioration of psychomotor performance were seen in patients without amelioration of their psychopathologic symptoms, especially when treated with moclobemide. These findings were regarded as a hint that possibly the therapeutic agent interacts with the wrong transmitter system and perhaps this is the reason for the deterioration of psychomotor functions.","2699":"Healthy ambulatory subjects took 6 different MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) orally for 2 to 4 weeks. The new reversible MAO-A inhibitors brofaromine and moclobemide were compared with the irreversible MAOIs clorgyline, selegiline, phenelzine and tranylcypromine. Pressor responsiveness to oral tyramine was assessed before, during and after treatment. In unmedicated subjects, doses of tyramine to raise systolic blood pressure by at least 30 mmHg (PD30) ranged between 200 and 800 mg. During treatment with MAOIs, the PD30 decreased. The ratio of median effective doses (ED50) of tyramine (pre- vs post-treatment) was: selegiline 5, moclobemide 7, brofaromine 10, clorgyline 10, phenelzine 13 and tranylcypromine 55. Pressor responsiveness normalized within 8 days after stopping the reversible MAOIs and 30 days after tranylcypromine. The increased sensitivity after phenelzine persisted for longer than 8 weeks and after clorgyline for longer than 15 weeks. The results suggest that the two reversible MAO-A inhibitors moclobemide and brofaromine carry a much reduced liability to tyramine-related hypertensive reactions.","2700":"The rat studies presented in this manuscript show that the new non-hydrazine compounds moclobemide, brofaromine and toloxatone have a profile typical of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitors. These inhibitors are short-acting (16-24 h), reversible, non-hepatotoxic and have only low liability to potentiate tyramine pressor effects (cheese-effect). The present results in rats and the clinical trials provide evidence that moclobemide is an orally active MAO-A inhibitor which, due to its remarkably low tyramine potentiating pressor effects and to its lack of anticholinergic activity, has a very attractive pharmacological profile. In contrast to moclobemide, tranylcypromine is an irreversible and mixed MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitor with long-lasting effects. This hydrazine derivative is not devoid of hepatotoxic effects and markedly potentiates tyramine pressor effects. Moclobemide, being a particularly safe MAO-A inhibitor, seems to be an effective new compound for the therapy of exogenous and endogenous depressive states.","2701":"","2702":"13 patients with major depressive disorder, who responded well to the reversible MAO-A-inhibitor moclobemide after unsuccessful initial treatment with tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants were monitored under naturalistic outpatient therapy conditions with moclobemide plasma level control for an average of 7.4 months. Due to depressive relapse moclobemide treatment had to be discontinued for 6 patients. Increased dosages or the addition of a tricyclic antidepressant did not bring about any sufficient improvement. The relapse occurred after an average of 2-3 months of treatment with moclobemide administration. In the case of 7 patients it was possible to discontinue treatment with moclobemide after an average of 9.7 months with an incremental reduction in dosage. Recurring depressive symptoms were counteracted in the case of 2 patients by increasing dosages and adding a tricyclic antidepressant. The patients reported good tolerance of the drug as compared to tri- or tetracyclics.","2703":"After a critical discussion with antiquated and actual problems to the electroconvulsive therapy the problem-important peculiarities of progress and treatment of the psychosis in the higher age are exhibited. In search of satisfactoring solutions we used Dexamethazon as a supplemental premedication in the electroconvulsive therapy and by this way we found out a remarkable minimize of complications which allowed to put in more frequently the electroconvulsive therapy during the psychosis in the higher age. This leads to a general optimation of prognosis of the late psychical diseases. Beside the method itself the urgency of indications and exclusion of standards are described in the same way, also there are shown the few complications in comparison with the successes of therapy of 2010 electricalconvulsive therapies from 433 patients.","2704":"The use of electroconvulsive treatment is discussed from the viewpoint of the psychotherapist. It is explained that such treatment is incompatible with genuine psychotherapy.","2705":"Ergotherapy or occupational therapy is an indispensable part of psychiatric treatment, and which has an exceptionally long history of use ergotherapy focuses on psychopathology. Treatment of schizophrenic patients with batic-work exemplifies how product oriented creative work, with concrete materials, can be used to regain capabilities which have been lost during an illness and\/or to foster healthy coping strategies in a compensatory manner. Ergotherapy can be viewed as a \"mediator therapy\" and as such, is always part of a complex, general treatment plan. Physicians referring patients for ergotherapy have a responsibility to clarify indications as well as to specify treatment demands.","2706":"Based on retrospective investigation using hospital records of 44 schizophrenic patients of a rehabilitation department, who committed suicide between 1966 and 1986, the paper discusses demographic and psychological features of schizophrenic suicide in comparison with international literature. Subjects who committed suicide were found to be accumulated within age-range 25 to 30 years and between one or two years of duration of illness. 20% of subjects died in an acute psychotic state, 58% had been found within a depressive episode and 66% had confronted themselves with their social situation and\/or future in the light of their illness.","2707":"The paper refers to primary not obvious, but severe nostalgic reactions in the inpatient treatment and rehabilitation of schizophrenics which frequently lead to discontinuity of treatment. After a brief historical survey some clinical cases will illustrate that nostalgia is both expression of strong regressive tendencies and preventive mechanism to protect from psychosis and\/or suicide. Finally the management of nostalgic reactions is discussed.","2708":"For a long period of time, the coping and compensatory mechanisms that arise from the patients with schizophrenic psychoses themselves have been considered only to a small extent by the psychiatric research. On the basis of Huber's concept of basic symptoms, we extended the six categories of coping mechanisms which are described in the Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms (BSABS) by three further categories. With ten schizophrenic patients - mostly in-patients - semistructured interviews concerning these categories were done. All patients were found to have coping and compensatory mechanisms, and as a contribution to recognize and describe these mechanisms, parts of the patients' remarks are quoted. This is a prerequisite for an operationalized recording on larger patient populations that will possibly also allow correlation-statistical conclusions.","2709":"Biological, psychical and social phenomena of acute and postacute phase of schizophrenic psychoses are differentiated according to systems theory. During the acute phase the therapeutical interventions aim to stabilize mainly the biological and psychical sphere, whereas for the post-acute phase the emphasis lays on the psychical and social phenomena. This phase-oriented coupling between the therapist, the patient and his\/her social network promotes a successive restructuring by generating consensual spheres, which help the patient and his\/her social net to find new ways for autonomous development.","2710":"There is still a lack of interest in problems emerging in the institutional treatment of the psychiatric AIDS-patient. The small number of articles dealing with the treatment of the acute ill is reported. None of them regards the risk of HIV-infection for chronic mental ill or mental retarded persons in greater institutions. Ethical, legal, and practical implications of this problem are discussed.","2711":"3 case histories of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and acute organic psychoses are reported. Their psychoses can be classified as benefaction or blissfulness psychoses. A handfull of previous reports classify similar acute organic psychoses as symptomatic manias. The respective descriptions make obvious that these psychoses are homogenous among each other and that their contents represent a vivid reflection over a life situation which had been thoroughly changed by the AIDS illness.","2712":"Starting from an apparent every-day situation in daily clinic life--the encounter between patients and therapeutic team in a sojourn chosen by the first ones--reflections are made about patterns of relations shown there. These contain partly complicated transference - and counter-transference-mechanisms and represent an always new challenge for the team to deal with the own professional role and the engagement toward the mentally sick.","2713":"Nine patients are reported with marked cerebellar side-effects under antidepressant treatment, mostly in combination with other psychopharmacological agents. The main symptoms were dysmetria, ataxia, intentional tremor, dysarthria and rarely myocloni. In nearly all cases symptomatology disappeared by slight dosis reduction of the antidepressant. Pathophysiology could be best explained by influence on nonadrenergic afferences of cerebellar cortex.","2714":"Despite the advances in the treatment of depression, 10 to 30% of all depressions remain--depending on the definition of the term--refractory to treatment. Having clarified possible causes such as wrong diagnosis, poor compliance, inadequate treatment, drug interactions and psychological factors, various treatment methods can be applied. However it is necessary to know not only the efficacy but also the side effects and contraindications of these methods.","2715":"In psychiatry, there are wide-spread efforts to make diagnoses more objective in the sense of psychological test theory. From the point of radical constructivism, psychiatric diagnoses is regarded as a construct and its interactional basis is stressed. So, it always contains an essential subjective dimension, which should be accepted and utilized for treatment.","2716":"2-3 years after having been treated in a special crisis intervention inpatient department, 404 patients were asked to write down in an anonymous letter what kind of therapy they had since undergone, how they feel at present, and how they rate the treatment in retrospect. The main reasons for the crisis had been conflicts in partnership relations such as separation or divorce. The patients covered by the inquiry--about 40% of them had been treated directly after attempted suicide--had again consulted their family doctor (almost 80%) or a psychiatrist (slightly more than 40%). 50% of the patients who could be contacted, had since participated in individual or group therapy. 23% had to return to inpatient treatment. Feeling tone (according to a standard rating scale) was depressive in only 40% of the patients and normal in far more than one-half. Index treatment was considered as \"unhelpful\" by only 3.4% of the patients. More than 95% of the patients would recommend the crisis intervention ward to other patients, too.","2717":"40 nurses (female and male) were asked to complete a semi-standardised questionnaire on their reaction patterns to the suicide of a psychiatric patient. Prominently featured was the wish to undergo better training and continuing education, the need for improved external conditions and also the wish to improve one's own knowledge and handling of own feelings of inadequacy and guilt. Psychohygiene is in need of a forum--for example, a Balint group--to process and manage self-reproaches and self-accusations.","2718":"Epileptic and diabetic patients with suicidal tendency are compared in a retrospective study, both types of patients being characterized by chronic disease and social handicaps. Both these groups are predominantly preoccupied with self-intoxication by tranquilisers and\/or alcohol, whereas in the group of epileptics examined in this study there is a predominance of \"cruel\" kinds of self-destruction, i.e. suicide, without any obvious connection with the type of the epileptic attacks. Patients repeatedly attempting suicide are not definitely subject to any higher incidence of attacks compared with the other patients, the frequency of attacks being within a wide range among these relapsing suicides. Epileptic patients who are potential suicides are more often found to have been suffering from an affective disorders for a prolonged period than those of the diabetic group (dysthymic disturbance according to DSM III).","2719":"The relationship between the course of illness and the therapeutic circumstances was investigated in 6 cases of schizophrenic patients who had committed suicide. All patients committed suicide following repeated stationary treatments with only partial remission. More than previously reported in the literature insufficient treatment on one side and a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship to the doctor with the following repulsion and hopelessness on the other side appear to determine the suicidal dynamics in the context of a multidimensional concept of suicide: If insufficient therapeutic efficacy disappoints doctor and patient and if the patient cannot fulfill rehabilitation requirements, he is often given up and then gives up himself. From that, suicideprophylactic aspects should be derived.","2720":"From the time psychiatry had become a scientific discipline in its own right, sociopsychiatric efforts have been directed towards erecting a second outpatient care pillar in the psychiatric patient care setup to make up for the drawbacks of oversize psychiatric hospitals that were the problematic heritage of erstwhile Prussia. During the period of the German Empire under Kaiser William II these efforts were not honored by the state. This started, with serious consequences, a vicious circle of institutionalising mentally deranged patients, a procedure that seemed to inflate the incidence of these diseases to the dimensions of a menace and hence created a fertile soil for the axioms of \"reacial hygiene\" to take root. The Bavarian psychiatrist Gustav Kolb (1870-1938), who realised how much of this development was really \"home made\", demanded in 1908--pursuing and expanding the ideas of that paradigmatic scientist and first sociopsychiatrist, Wilhelm Griesinger (1817-1868)--once again to recognise psychiatric care by setting up a second outpatient pillar in the form of an \"Open Public Welfare Service\" attached to a relevant psychiatric hospital. However, the full significance of his reformatory proposals was not realised at that time. When finally open public welfare was translated into reality during 1918-1933 as a result of the zealous efforts on the part of the reformatory psychiatrists, this was mainly done to save cost, whereas Kolb's original aims were largely lost in the process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2721":"In the first part of the article, the most important principles of action are described that determined the work done so far in the outpatient department of the Sociopsychiatric Clinic Berne. From this work the idea developed that psychiatric long-term patients would best be cared for by a care system divided into sectors and linked first of all to a community mental health centre. First experiences collected in a community health centre project in Berne are described. Details are given in respect of the location and arrangement of the available rooms and space. The central importance of the round table for the work of the medical and nursing staff with the patients, their families and the entire social environment is stressed. The authors try to explain their mode of working and their attitude on the examples of first contact with the patients and the handling of a crisis situation. It is the aim of this sociopsychiatric work to ensure maximum possible autonomy and self-responsibility of the patients.","2722":"The efficacy of a token economy system was assessed in a study involving 76 chronic schizophrenics who were inpatients during a treatment period of four years. The interrelations between therapeutic success on the one hand, and socio-economic as well as course of disease-related factors on the other were studied, including psychopathology and the efficacy of token economy.","2723":null,"2724":"The complementary psychiatric (home) area is a relatively new branch of institutional psychiatry, the therapeutic evaluation and integration of which into everyday psychiatric thinking and acting has not yet become a reality. The evaluative study presented here covered 53 inmates and concerned their everyday life, the success of the treatment, predictors and perspectives. A gradual change in the means and aims of psychiatric rehabilitation seems to be materializing: the (re-)integration of the subject into his family of origin or into the psychosocial network will probably become more important than just reinstating the patient into his original place and kind of work. For the future it appears desirable that the inmates and the equipment are financially secured, that the entire setup is integrated into the system of psychiatric institutions, and that the method can be applied to further groups of patients.","2725":"After representing the legal and institutional frame there follows a working report of the ambulance of the PKH Riedstadt. The tasks of out-patient services as they are described in the Psychiatrie-Enquete are the starting point to look at teamwork, treating experiences, change of numbers of hospitalisation and change of time to stay in the hospital. The expectations concerning patients with psychosis and retarded patients with mental illness are fulfilled, but not those concerning patients with organic brain damages or addiction. Possible arguments are discussed.","2726":"56 mostly schizophrenic longterm patients of a community based outpatient facility were questioned about their autonomy referring to living, working and finances, to their dependence on parents, partners, relatives and professional helpers in accomplishing every-day tasks to their social contacts and to their contentment. Only 11% of the patients live with parents and 4% are financially dependent from them. Parents are only helping by accomplishing every-day tasks, when the patients are living with them. Even then patients accomplish more than half of their affairs by themselves. However there is a strong emotional tie on parents. Professional helpers, mostly working in halfway facilities, relieve relatives in a high degree. 36% of the patients live single and are very independent, they accomplish 82% of their affairs by themselves. 23% live with a partner, who helps probably not more than he would do with a healthy partner. 3\/4 of the patients are content with their living conditions. Possible explanations are discussed. The investigated patients, mostly quite impaired, are altogether far more autonomous than expected. We think that this is due to a comprehensive social network of outpatient treatment and halfway facilities combined with a sufficient invalidity insurance. This network seems to lighten the burden of the relatives, mainly the parents, as demanded by the family-burden-literature.","2727":null,"2728":"Type and frequency of psychotropic drug treatment have been analysed in the case of 1154 institutionalized and non-institutionalized mentally retarded adults. The psychotropic drug prevalence amounts to 21.7%, only about one half of corresponding rates in other studies; possible causes of this result are discussed. Neuroleptics are prescribed most frequently by far, succeeded by anxiolytics. The psychotropic drug prevalence is significantly related to age, sex, and setting. A comparison of the psychotropic drug treatment of 1980 with that of 1986 above all shows a distinctly rarer prescription of anxiolytics and hypnotics as well as a decrease of polypharmacy in 1986.","2729":"Deaf persons reside in almost all psychiatric hospitals in the Federal Republic, as a recent inquiry has shown. The total population of deaf inmates is probably around 600. These persons have so far not been eligible for treatment specially adapted to their deafness. The present article attempts to stimulate readiness for a specific type of care of such persons. It describes the special psychic stress to which they are exposed in an environment with intact hearing and highlights especially the severe barriers of contact that cannot be overcome by the deaf without assistance from the environment. The subsequent presentation of approaches to the psychosocial care of the deaf is rounded off by a few thoughts on further development.","2730":null,"2731":"Based upon the observation that aspects of sexuality are rarely considered in psychiatric practice, a questionnaire study was performed to differentially assess the attitudes and experiences of psychiatric staff with this topic. 145 members of different professional groups and several psychiatric in-patient institutions answered the questions. The results of the study indicate for example that sexuality generally is more important in psychiatric institutions than one could have expected according to the psychiatric literature. Stereotypical attitudes concerning the sexual life of psychiatric patients were rare and more frequently found to be unspecific for psychiatry, for example those related to differential meanings of female and male sexuality. A further result of the study showed that sexual knowledge and confidence in handling conversations about sexuality seemed to be less important for the reduction of problems in the staff's reactions to sexually active patients than the possibility to discuss the own uncertainties and their recognition. Generally, the results could serve as a basis for psychiatric staff to facilitate the consideration of sexual matters within their institutions.","2732":"Two groups comparable in age of 20 male and 20 female schizophrenics, all under neuroleptic treatment, were asked by way of questionnaire about their attitude towards sexuality, their sexuality, their sexual behaviour and their sexual difficulties. Sexuality was considered to be an important aspect of a person's life. More than one third of the patients indicated regular sexual contacts. In the group of males a high incidence of erectile dysfunctions was apparent, whereas the women showed a prevalence of general sexual dysfunctions. Both sexes indicated an inhibition of sexual desire. The impaired ability for sexual reaction and experience was felt partly to be positive, partly negative. Etiologically such disorders are caused by the side effects of the neuroleptic treatment, as well as by a disturbed capacity for interpersonal relationships. In the longterm treatment of schizophrenics, increased attention should be paid to sexual counselling.","2733":"Sexuality of psychiatric inpatients is scarcely noticed and so rather negated. The therapeutic discourse remains scanty and contradictory. This article tries a survey of the literature as well as of the topics in the field of lust, sexuality, of the destinies of drives, and instinct disturbances of mental ill inpatients.","2734":"Physical attacks of patients against the treating therapist during hospitalisation are severe complications in the treatment process, creating a variety of problems for all those involved. Partly due to taboo, literature almost does not deal with physical attacks, although they are likely to be a rather common phenomenon. Contrary to this tendency, it seems fair to say that as a treatment problem these situations deserve special attention. Causes of aggressive escalation will be examined by means of two case studies. The question as to how to prevent physical attacks as well as ways to deal with them will be reconsidered.","2735":"The paper tries to describe often neglected forms of iatrogenic violence in clinical psychiatry. These examples are different from those forms of violent treatment in psychiatry, which are commonly known and discussed (medication, fixation, isolation). One aim of the paper is to emphasize determinants and modalities of emotional and verbal violence used without being noticed in clinical routine work. The idea is supported that the patient may voluntarily estimate his\/her closeness to the therapist, who, on the other hand, should try to abandon therapeutic overactivity. An atmosphere should be established which allows the patient to refuse therapeutic offers without fear of revenge.","2736":"We report about a project where there is thought for some months a new kind of therapy called Cognitive Training for schizophrenic patients to male and female nurses of a big psychiatric hospital. First we explain this kind of therapy, then we tell about the organization, the experiences and the difficulties which existed when we made the training program and when the nurses tried to practice this knowledge in the daily clinical life.","2737":"The author describes a psychoanalytical liaison service conducted over a period of two years on behalf of a psychiatric ward for acutely demented patients. About one-sixth of the psychiatric patients admitted during this time were subjected to psychoanalytical examination. Psychiatric inpatient treatment was suggested for about one-tenth of them, i.e. two per cent of all referrals to the ward. Due to the introduction of a psychodynamic mode of viewing the cases, together with a patient-centered interpretation of interaction patterns, the general atmosphere in the ward changed gradually. The article concludes with general considerations as to the use of the psychoanalytical approach in psychiatry.","2738":"Teamwork is an element of psychiatric therapy that is both necessary and risky. Closely bundled interactions between therapists and therapists must always be kept clearly in mind in everyday routine work, in so far as all types of cooperation between therapists are directly and at the same time an instrument of therapy, the more so for learning qua identification. Zones and forms of success and failure of teamwork are described on the basis of methodically not corrected experience along a few \"axes\" of team behaviour. This also leads to the discussion of a few ethical implications of teamwork.","2739":"Forensic psychiatry as a subspecialty variously differs from general psychiatry. Therefore psychiatrists working in forensic psychiatry are confronted with ethical problems of other kind. In the following several ethical problems connecting with forensic psychiatric examination are pointed out. Finally the question is discussed, whether there is a need of special ethical guidelines for forensic psychiatry.","2740":"A study on 50 patients with endogenous and non-endogenous depression yielded a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 77% for the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Endogenous depressive patients recovering from depression within one week mostly showed sufficient cortisol suppression. \"Loss of feelings\" was associated more frequently with cortisol nonsuppression, while a certain relationship between psychogenic induction of the present depressive episode and adequate suppression could be demonstrated. In conclusion, the diagnostic utility of the DST is of minor importance. However, in certain cases the DST could be recommended as a predictor of clinical course.","2741":"The importance of the computertomographic, testpsychological, and clinical findings at the appearance of depressive syndromes during the involutional age and the senium has been investigated. The hypothesis is not to confirm which says that a cerebral atrophy indicated by the computer-assisted tomogram shows an unfavourable prognosis. The supposal saying that inferior results of an intelligence test (HAWIE) indicate a negative prediction was not to corroborate. By the way, patients who often had been in stationary treatment tended to show an unfavourable development (p less than 0.1) of the disease.","2742":"The construction and treatment setting of a psychogeriatric acute treatment unit of a psychiatric department at a general hospital is described. Besides the prevailing amount of organic brain syndromes, there were more neurotic and reactive disturbed patients compared to mental state hospitals, who were treated in a psychotherapeutic manner. Experiences in psychotherapy with elderly are described and evaluated and problems in diagnostic and therapy with primarily demented patients are presented. Furthermore are described the therapeutic styles of different professions and the difficulties in implementing the principles of the therapeutic community in a psychogeriatric setting.","2743":"A research project is under way at the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Berne, Switzerland, on predictors for new long-term patients, i.e. patients treated on an inpatient basis for more than a year. In a part study all new long-term patients admitted during one year (n = 44) were compared (on the basis of socioeconomic data, disease records, level of intelligence (PMT), psychiatric signs and symptoms pattern (BPRS) and nonadjusted behaviour) with random samples taken from the hospital admissions (n = 58). The overall total of the individual results shows that the new long-term patients originate from two different populations. About 60 per cent are chronically mentally ill patients--mainly schizophrenics--who are additionally under disability in many respects. The remaining two-fifths of the new long-term patients are represented by senile demented patients. It seems that they become permanent psychiatric patients only due to the progressive course of their disease. The article discusses the ways and means to cope with the 50% increase in this patient group that we must anticipate by 2000 A. D. as a result of present age development trends.","2744":null,"2745":null,"2746":"In this study the course of rehospitalisation after one, 2 1\/2 and 5 years was examined in a sample of 113 readmitted patients of different diagnostic groups. In a second step of analysis occupational, sociodemographic and clinical parameters of these patients were related to the readmission after 5 years and studied if these parameters allow a predictive statement. It was shown that 40%-60% (dependent of diagnoses) of the patients were readmitted in a period of 5 years. The course of the rehospitalization also varied in the different diagnostic groups. The most striking result was the rate of readmission of the schizophrenic psychoses which was at the time of the 1 year catamnesis below average after the 2 1\/2 years analysis however above average. Besides these findings occupational and clinical predictors were identified in all diagnostic groups with exception of the schizophrenic psychoses group. The results are discussed and attention is put on possible consequences to prevent rehospitalization.","2747":"Domiciliary visiting and follow-up care of mentally ill patients is one of the foci of treatment-and-care activities of a mobile outpatient care unit working in social psychiatry. Its self-declared aim is to either avoid or to cut down inpatient treatment or reference to a psychiatric hospital or asylum, and thus to enable the patient to lead a life of greater freedom and fewer restrictions. 217 home visits by members of two psychiatric mobile outpatient care units were evaluated and analysed via a descriptive and differentiated questionnaire study. The analysis revealed that patients themselves had requested a visit in only 12.4% of the cases. This seems to be a characteristic feature of psychiatric care. Another striking factor is the mediation by a \"third person\", for in almost 40% of all the cases the initiative came from relatives, neighbours, the family doctor, the police, the welfare office, the landlord and others, showing how closely follow-up care is interlinked with the patient's social environment. The style of working of the psychiatric care unit is reflected by the varied participation of representatives of different professions in the home visiting service. It is also remarkable that in 31 patients (i.e. 18% of the home visits) the home visit established the first contact between therapist and patient. Whenever such an initial contact was accomplished, the home visit always had a triadic structure. It is a direct consequence of our study that the members of a mobile psychiatric care service should boldly tackle the problems of basic concepts regarding the position and status of the individual within the system of psychiatric and welfare care.","2748":"A rehabilitation programme at the University Clinic of Social Psychiatry, Berne, is described. The facility includes a half-way house and sheltered home in a suburb, where 20 psychiatric long-stay patients are trained for an independent life in the community. In a follow-up study 80 patients, mostly chronic schizophrenics, were examined in order to evaluate the outcome. After an average time-interval of 6 years only 14% were in a mental hospital, 31% lived in sheltered accommodations, and 55% lived independently in the community. 57% of the patients were working full- or part time and a further 20% worked in sheltered workshops. Apart from these very good results a careful assessment of the social circumstances reveals an ongoing impairment: 80% have only poor social relations and depend on psychiatric treatment and medication, 77% need invalidity rents and more than one third live or work in sheltered institutions. The study shows that psychiatric long-stay patients can reach a stable reintegration in the community. The ongoing impairment mainly affects the social relations and the financial resources, areas which are important for the quality of life.","2749":"On the basis of three halfway houses which have been studied using ethnographic methods, this study seeks to describe both general and specific structures existing in these halfway houses. The proposed typology situates the halfway houses in a spectrum between \"therapy\" and \"daily life\" and interprets their therapeutic effect as resulting from the successful use of therapy and effective patterns of living within their confines. A central role is allotted to \"daily life\" as the environment in which the incorporation of therapeutic measures into patterns of living, which have been routinised and anchored into a certain milieu, takes place. The chances and risks in the therapeutic process which are characteristic for the different types of halfway house are clearly demonstrated. The observation of therapeutic procedures in the halfway houses in relation to the biography and family background of the patients results in a critical analysis of the basic tenets of the so-called milieu therapy with the consequence that the question which halfway house for which patient must be reformulated on a wider basis than has been the case up to the present.","2750":"After ten years of experience with therapeutic vacations in a department for chronic psychotic patients the aptitude of these vacations as part of a long term ward-treatment programme is discussed. A vacation with eight patients illustrates problems and disadvantages. It is concluded from these experiences that therapeutic vacations can help in several ways during the initial development of a social-psychiatric programme but that the group of patients who profit from such vacations should be more clearly specified. Above all, however, it is concluded that the quantitative augmentation of extramural therapeutic activities cannot be a substitute for the qualitative development of a ward treatment concept. This should have as its goal the establishment of a niche in which schizophrenic experience as a way of survival is possible and worth living.","2751":"In the fifties the \"social network\"-concept was developed in order to improve the analysis of the structure of different social groups; later on, its emphasis has shifted to the study of \"personal networks\", that deal with the structure of the social relations of a \"focal individual\". In the latter sense the term \"social network\" will be used in this paper. Social networks are discussed in terms of morphological characteristics such as the size or the number of clusters as well as in terms of interactional characteristics such as the number of social contacts of the focal person. Studies concerning the social networks of schizophrenics that have been carried out so far showed the following results: In comparison with the social networks of the mentally healthy those of schizophrenic patients are markedly smaller in size and contain a smaller number of clusters. The proportion of family members in the social networks of schizophrenics is higher than in those of the mentally healthy. Social relations of the latter generally show a more complex structure than those of the schizophrenics. The social networks of schizophrenics patients with multiple admissions are generally smaller than those of first admission schizophrenic patients who also have more extrafamilial contacts. -The last section of this paper discusses methodical problems of the existing studies that deal with the social networks of schizophrenic patients; some suggestions are made concerning the application of the network-concept to psychiatric therapy.","2752":"We found 16 patients (15%) taking the anticholinergic biperiden because of its psychotropic action, occasionally, rather frequently or regularly, among a subgroup of 120 drug-dependent patients (drugs of the barbiturate and amphetamin types) out of a studied total of 194 imprisoned male addicts. These biperiden abusers suffered without exception from polytoxicomania associated with drug dependence and alcoholism. Most prominent was drug dependence on drugs of the morphine type. We could not prove a case of an isolated \"primary\" abuse of biperiden. Direct medical prescription was a rather secondary factor in procuring this preparation, in contrast to analgesics, tranquilisers, barbiturates and clomethiazol. Increase of biperiden abuse is due, on the one hand, to a generally noticeable tendency to polytoxicomania, and on the other hand to a change in Federal German drug prescription rules effective 1 August 1986 according to which fenetylline hydrochloride, a sympathomimetic, is now subject to medical prescription. Other centrally acting anticholinergics were unknown among this group of patients and were not abused. The results are discussed on the basis of available literature.","2753":"Our experience shows that independent of the place of residence those people are significantly more likely to be released from psychiatric hospital after a few days who had been referred by physicians with (at least as their medical activities seem to show) less experience in psychiatry than specialists in that discipline. The percentage of patients referred to a psychiatric hospital in accordance with lower saxony law and whose long-term hospitalisation appears warranted, differs between the individual groups of physicians and is additionally dependent on the place of residence. In fact, in the county of Hannover those physicians who were not engaged in psychiatry referred an even larger proportion of patients to psychiatric hospitals in 1982 than did the psychiatrists, whereas in the city of Hannover 60% of those patients referred to hospital by psychiatrists subsequently remained there longer as inmates than the patients of the other group. Summing up, we can at least suspect that in a considerably large number of cases compulsory referral was restored to--in correlation with the psychiatric experience of the physician and\/or depending upon the situation--because none of the other legally provided measures appeared to be available, for example, the official sociopsychiatric counselling offices which are closed outside normal office hours and on weekends. Thus, competent help in cases of crisis is unavailable if the need arises during an odd time of the day or on a Saturday or Sunday, the only way out being referral to a psychiatric hospital.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2754":"Patients in forensic psychiatry and their relatives are both doubly stigmatized by the labels psychiatric disturbance and delinquency. In an expert-guided group for relatives of forensic patients at Karl-Bonhoeffer-Psychiatric Hospital Berlin choice of topic and frequency of attendance indicated enormous guilty feelings. Defense against these guilty feelings could only be kept up by great effort. Support of relatives in forensic psychiatry seems advisable also for the rehabilitation of the patients themselves and prevention of relapse.","2755":"All the different branches in forensic psychiatry have to face identical handicaps resulting from the difficulties in cooperation with the law-court. For the psychiatrist, his identity as a therapist is contradictory to his forensic tasks. The paper deals with the resulting dilemmata (partiality v. neutrality; diagnostic approach v. legal consequence; psychiatric v. legal methodology and scientific standard). The best way for both sciences to cooperate is by reflecting these handicaps and dilemmata rather than denying them.","2756":"Basing on 172 clinically recorded goitres among 787 patients treated with lithium (21.9%) we studied the question as to whether goitre formation due to lithium has any relevance within the concept of relapse prevention in affective disorders. A statistical comparison of essential disease parameters between the group of patients suffering from struma (goitre) and the total group shows that there is no special type or course of affective disorder with a particular affinity to the development of struma. Likewise, we can conclude from a comparison of treatment course and effectively parameters between both groups that development of struma under influence on the course of treatment or on the efficiency of prophylaxis. The results point to an irrelevance of lithium goitre in respect of psychiatric effects (this does not imply that it is irrelevant in respect of general medical aspects or endocrinology).","2757":"Psychiatric research and therapy recently evinced increasing interest in patients suffering from attention deficit disorder. \"Attention deficit disorder\" is a category of mental disorders listed in DSM III, with a separate diagnostic subgroup for attention deficit disorders persisting in adults who had been hyperkinetic in childhood (\"attention deficit disorder-residual type\"); however, this does not feature in a corresponding manner in the ICD 9 version. Since there are practically no therapy studies in existence within the ICD range that can be relevant for such disorders, we studied the treatment of an adult patient with the psychostimulant fenetylline under clinical conditions and found a significant improvement in attention performance. However, on integration in a long-term day-clinic rehabilitation programme we found that low-dose neuroleptic treatment was on the whole of greater benefit than fenetylline treatment.","2758":"The authors describe and discuss the problems of a current long term international comparative study on rehabilitation for the mentally ill. Above all methodology of computerized data sampling should not interfere with the complex holistic structure of the underlying theory of rehabilitation. Thus first theoretical assumptions are explained emphasizing a holistic approach. With critical reference to earlier efforts and studies elsewhere structure of data organization is described with direct reference to the documentary sheets for case documentation use. The documentation form developed enhances precision of task definition, interdisciplinary work, self control for the professional, and the establishing of new hypothesis.","2759":"With reference to a recent reader on rehabilitation for the chronically mentally ill in the German Democratic Republic and the USSR the authors travelled to Leningrad, USSR, to learn about the efforts to integrate rather than add up multidisciplinary approaches to work rehabilitation. The authors found a sheltered workshop for about 400 patients where much of the principles of work rehabilitation obviously work: flexible and manyfold work, well adapted to the varying standards of the patients both unskilled workers and patients with academic background. The workshop being one branch of the nationally significant Bechterev Institute for Psychiatry and Neurology also transfers patients to the general workforce where rehabilitation patients are paid a 125% salary. Both the optimistic atmosphere and the economically self supporting shop give good reason to learn more about rehabilitation for the chronically ill in the USSR and the efforts to progress.","2760":"The authors report about a long term practical program involving the families of schizophrenic patients in the therapeutical context. They argue for advocacy of the two, both patient and \"his\" family. Detailed hints with theoretical backing are given to find a way of common sense for the patient, the family, and the therapists to gain a common, though not oversimplified and complexity reducing working context.","2761":"Within the process of individual psychotherapy the author stresses the importance of understanding the initial everyday life view of \"what is about being sick\" for to establish a working, and cooperative setting. Thus, a three step procedure has been developed to guide the patient to a self responsible attitude toward conflicts and disease well at variance with common beliefs about healing, and the roles of the professional and his client herein.","2762":"The development of psychiatry and\/with psychotherapy ever since the beginning of the German Democratic Republic after WW2 is described and analysed. The author's main focus is on the confrontation, addition, and cooperation of both the classical medicine of matters and medicine of mind with conflicting, and at least varying paradigmatic reference. The pro and cons on shock therapy are discussed as a crucial point, here. The author holds that shock therapy interferes with the basics of a therapy where the patient is an integral and responsible part of the work as the mode of such treatment annihilates the Leitmotiv of psychotherapy within the framework of social psychiatry.","2763":"For about three years psychotherapy has been introduced as a must for any medical student in the USSR. The author describes the policies behind this important step, its implementation, and first effects in detail. Psychotherapeutical services for the hospitalized, for crisis intervention, ambulant teams, its significance for surgery, and the delivery of psychotherapeutical short term programs in spas are described. The significance of psychotherapeutical work as a link between the specialized medical branches is stressed.","2764":"This paper declines the anthropological and philosophical background for understanding the less understandable: suicide. Though 'understanding' (in terms of the one who wants to understand) implies the rules of its own (i.e. rationalistic) casted beyond the reefs of knowing the author tries to find traces to make up a new perspective of the horizon. With examples from his therapeutical work, and quoting mythology, and historically famous cases thinking within the terms of suicide is delined, and consequences hereof are stated.","2765":"In the first section of this paper, the clinically relevant features of the Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition (DSM III) are described and compared with those of the ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases). It is evident, among other facts, that the narrower concept of schizophrenia and the extension of the scope of affective disorders exercises an effect particularly on the class of schizoaffective disorders, which are considerably reduced in number. The second section of the paper is a report on the experience with the practical application of the DSM III at the Department of Psychiatry (University Hospital) of the University of Freiburg, FRG. A comparison of diagnoses based on DSM III with those based correspondingly on ICD 9 resulted e.g. in a reduction of the number of neurosis diagnoses and a surprising increase by a factor of three and a half of diagnosed personality disorders. The possible causes of such \"movements\" and their implications for clinical everyday practice are discussed.","2766":"37 of 43 patients who had been hospitalised because of schizophrenia for the first time in 1954 and subjected to electroconvulsive treatment in the same year, were reexamined 30 years later in respect of course of the disease, social situation, psychopathological pattern and late complications. Whereas in 1954 the direct treatment result was assessed as full remission in 11 cases, as part remission in 16 and as not improved in 10 patients, a similar pattern was obtained in the assessment of the final stages according to the criteria of Bleuler or Ciompi, respectively, namely, a high proportion of socially inconspicuous patients and of severe residual states or permanently hospitalised cases. This result is in agreement with wellknown long-term follow-up studies and is clearly opposed to the assumption that the course of the disease is favourably influenced by drastic shock treatment.","2767":"A regular family support group was established within an outpatient clinic for demented elderly patients. At the outset of the group, the relatives knew little about the disease and about the available resources of help, but some were highly experienced in the management of dementia. The group provided information, exchange of experience, practical problem-solving, support in emotional difficulties, and clarification of interpersonal conflicts in the family. The effect of the group showed in decreased feelings of burden and tension in most participants. The present observations suggest that family support groups should be long-termed and that the experts' primary task is to activate and amplify the self-help potential of the caregivers.","2768":null,"2769":"All 77 residents aged under 65 in geriatric nursing homes and homes for the elderly in the Berlin (W) district of Charlottenburg were assessed in regard to mental illness and impairment. Additionally, data were collected covering psychopathology, clinical and personal data, medical and social care as well as the extent of contacts to nonresidents and institutional setting. 85% of these younger residents-8% of the total residential population-proved to be mentally ill. Primarily, they suffered from addiction, schizophrenia or mental retardation. Projecting our results to the total residential population of Berlin living in such homes, 728 younger mentally ill or retarded patients or 0,5%o of the population aged under 65 would live in such institutions. These residents had histories of unfavorable living conditions and a long psychiatric case history with frequent hospitalization. Distinct differences in regard to patient data as well as settings were found among public, welfare and private institutions. Results are discussed and arguments for improving care of this population are presented.","2770":"Indirect care for gerontopsychiatric patients by means of patient-centered group discussions under the heading \"How to deal with Difficult Patients\" is presented as a succession of case reports concerning the progress and course of the first year of a team counselling project in a home for aged persons. The theoretical results outline the framework of such patient-centred group discussions with the following cornerstones: Specialist training or continuing education, supervision, sociopsychiatric counselling and advising the institution; these topics are dealt with in detail. Our model of group discussions is subdivided into the following patient-centred developmental stages: Initiation, acceptance of the psychiatric line of thought, increasing specialist competence. Our paper supplies pointers with regard to the demands made on the discussion leaders, together with hints as to which factors connected with the individual cornerstones and developmental stages should be given special attention. It became evident that these group discussions help to impart more knowledge to the individual partners of the team and hence promote a greater amount of understanding of the psychological patterns of linkups in the development of each patient, thus enabling the medical staff to respond better and more adequately to the psychological needs of the individual patient. As the feeling grows in each individual that he can now cope better with the demands his profession makes on him, a feeling of satisfaction also grows among the team members and there is less job fluctuation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2771":"The authors are of the opinion that not enough use is being made of the possibility to treat patients suffering from various kinds of dependence, in special day hospitals or departments. Two different models are reported: briefly, the possibility of day hospital treatment instead of inpatient care, and in detail the type of treatment practised in Bremen following short-term inpatient treatment. The article describes the indications for admission, course of treatment, and handling of relapses, as well as the results of catamnestic follow-up questioning. The results encourage continuation of day hospital facilities and their increased utilisation.","2772":"104 group sessions with 59 male alcoholics were classified under 9 themes. At the beginning of self-experience sessions, all patients looked back to their drinking history. 8 patients reported mere facts, whereas 51 patients expressed their emotional involvement. Drinking style and themes of self-experience could not be definitely correlated. There was a statistical tendency for alcoholics with loss of control (Gamma-alcoholics) to describe themselves as craving for adventure, as men who tend to live according to their momentary needs whenever possible. Alcoholics with inability to abstain (Delta-alcoholics) describe themselves more often than Gamma-alcoholics as passive hangers-on, as persons who tend to drink as others do, who do not worry much about their alcohol intake, who become aware, by somatic and social consequences, that they cannot go on living as before. These results were compared to results found in research literature. It is astonishing that so little work has been done to find out the themes presented by alcoholics in the course of self-experience.","2773":"This article is intended as a contribution towards interpreting the development of psychiatric symptoms as a final result of disturbed processes of communication. We should like to point out that the importance of communication for normal and abnormal behaviour has been established both from the viewpoints of sociopsychology and family therapy as well as of cognition psychology and psychophysiology. The present study is limited to the presentation of clinical aspects, but it should be pointed out that a systematic phase concept of treatment can be developed via an integration of psychophysiological research studies on this subject; however, we have not gone into this possibility in detail in the present study.","2774":"Turkish magic healers called hodjas are working in West-Germany today. Our knowledge about their influence on Turkish patients is poor. They are consulted at least from patients with psychogenous diseases. The degree and the multiple dimensions of their influence and the possibility for the doctor to master the conflicting cultural identity of these patients is demonstrated on the base of four clinical case-histories.","2775":"The relations between diagnostic and therapeutic practice and the events of everyday life are investigated in a two-fold regard. The first view is directed towards the signification of \"psychiatry\" and of the psychiatric view-points in the everyday life of society; the second view is the experience of everyday life inside psychiatric institutions. Under both aspects an interest in the development and the both aspects an interest in the development and the process of mental illness is pursued, which is also an interest in correct diagnostic insight and in promoting therapeutic consequence that positively influences the process.","2776":"Three publications by K.P. Kisker that appeared in the 'sixties of the present century are milestones along an important path of panoramic changes in the recent history of psychiatry. They are model reflections of the steps or stages towards a new approach to understanding the social system represented by the hospital and the style of working practised therein. A present-day critical assessment is given of the forces that have been acting against this development, as pointed out by Kisker, and especially so of those originating from the dynamics of tension between the nursing and the medical staffs.","2777":null,"2778":"Important parts of the work of a psychiatric department of a district general hospital with regional care duty (115,000 people) are shown by an empirical study. For a period of 4 weeks all emergency and crisis situations in which patients appeared on the ward directly were registered. All telephone calls made for the same purpose were registered, too. The kind of the crisis and the kind of help were put into categories. The result of this study was, that in an urban area with approx. 100,000 people one can expect approx. 200 persons (2% of the population) to be in need of a frequent in many cases ward supported crisis intervention. The second part of the study shows with a patients case report, what possibilities do exist in the field of rehabilitation of chronic psychiatric patients within the community and what inherent difficulties there are.","2779":"The conceptual approach and the structures of psychiatric service have changed, and hence the question of efficacy of measures and institutions for mental patients is of special significance. In the U.S.A. this realization has led to a regulation that compulsorily prescribes the evaluation of Government-sponsored programs (Dowell and Ciarlo, 1983). Whereas the investigation into the efficacy of individual therapeutic measures is part of standard psychiatric research (Garfield and Bergin, 1978, Clark and del Guidice, 1970), the evaluation of institutions or part systems of service has only just begun, to a major part due to the methodical difficulties arising from investigating such a claim. It is often impossible, for both ethical and practical reasons, to initiate an experimental study approach that definitely provides for random allocation of patients to various service care and monitoring parameters. Hence, we must look for alternative research strategies enabling analysis of cause and effect relationships on the basis of observation studies. In this study we attempted to improve the significance of statistical analyses by means of adequate data analysis technique, the object of analysis being a community psychiatric service; such a procedure would restrict the number of possible alternative possibilities of interpretation. We could prove for a group of schizophrenic patients that continual aftercare by aftercare clinics had a really significant effect on the rehospitalization of patients, which was considerably reduced without entailing any adverse effect on the patients in consideration of the pattern of signs and symptoms involved.","2780":"The large-scale \"Psychiatry Inquiry\", or inquest, held in the Federal Republic of Germany in the 'seventies, represented a great step forward in the reformation of psychiatric patient care. However, the general consensus of opinion about the future development crumbled and fell apart by the end of the 'seventies. On the one hand, there was the demand for dissolving the psychiatric large-scale hospital whereas on the other hand the ancient type of lunatic asylum or mental hospital re-entered through the backdoor: therapy wards were separated spatially from care wards without the slightest regard for the modern concepts of mental illness, its treatment and its course. This article tries to point out that both tendencies are an expression of today's \"postmodernistic thinking\". They offer illusions of solutions, i.e. they simulate solutions in the sense of the postmodern technique of \"as though\" and do not pay any heed to the interests of the mental patient himself.","2781":"The author differentiates between two modes of perception, one is the \"expressive\" mode, stabilizing and aiming at constancy, the other is the \"impressive\" mode, penetrating the self and aiming at identification with the percept. The clinical relevance of the latter for the therapy of psychoses is demonstrated by five case studies. The \"Leib\" as the place of incidence of perception is viewed in its function for the interaction of physician and patient: above all psychotic border states induce forms of communication, which are remarkably close to the body and remain mostly unconscious, but might be the beginning and instigation of a whole of behaviour-(action) chains on the side of the therapist. For the purpose of a controlled handling of the instrument of therapeutic intervention it is necessary to bring to view precisely these processes occurring close to the body. The traditional idea of identity is embarrassing this process of perception.","2782":"","2783":"Taking paranoid conspiratory delusion as example, it is attempted to describe the connection between structure and content of delusions. Inspired by Freuds interpretation of the case Schreber, the cathexis of socially recognized meanings with subjective interest is described as a matrix of cathexis. Delusion is seen as a \"filling\" of \"cathexis-holes\".","2784":"After a brief introduction describing the development and organisation of the National Socialist extermination programmes to eliminate patients suffering from mental diseases, a description is given of the way these programmes were translated into reality in the then province of Hannover. The provincial government implemented these programmes hesitatingly but nevertheless as ordered, whereas the administrative decrees were complied with in a widely different manner by the individual psychiatric hospitals. These differences in the daily routine on-the-spot realisation of the extermination programmes suggest raising the question of professional ethics in psychiatry, as outlined by the author.","2785":"The problematic nature of the description of children and adolescents with deviating behavior becomes evident by the short representation of the pathways of three patients. The critical discussion of the \"usual\" way to speak during psychiatric every-day-life uncovers patterns of speech--inducing on the one side according to their own dynamics the labeling process and on the other side a fixation of the team in a \"stigmatisierendes Beurteilungssyndrom\" (rating-syndrome).","2786":"Patients with \"early disturbances\" partly display considerable resistance to treatment methods that promote regression or aim at uncovering inhibitions, since they themselves lack emotional differentiation. In an inpatient setting such patients are able to transfer their non-experienced share of feelings and references to the treating personnel. If these transferred feelings are not properly processed and managed, therapy blockades and communication blockades arise, resulting in considerable frustrations of all concerned within the therapeutic community. Against the background of these experiences we developed a ward group method inviting both patients and staff to join hands in creative playing (e.g. by acting a fairy tale on the stage); within this framework it is possible to shape latent group, ward and team conflicts on a metaphorical level. As a result we achieve a reduction of the emotional tension level within the ward, a reduction of team conflicts, and hence an improved therapeutical climate and better possibilities to translate into reality appropriate strategies for a fair solution of problems. The overall framework, the therapeutic concept, as well as the individual stages of work-in-progress in the realisation of the fairy-tale drama are described in detail (e.g. phase of birth of the fairy tale, phase of fairy-tale recital, phase of casting, actual performance phase and subsequent discussion phase). These steps are described both as regards their form and their contents; they are compared with other group techniques of a similar nature.","2787":"In a psychiatric emergency situation, the psychiatrist is expected to take immediate decisions and to intervene quickly and competently, what is difficult to realize with neurotic patients in a therapeutically satisfactory way. By openly showing his limitations and helplessness, he can deny a defining element of the emergency situation. By this reframing of the situation, changed and more positive prospects occur for dealing with the problem and the patient.","2788":"During one year one day the week a psychiatrist and a behavior therapist cooperate in treating neurotic patients asking for help in the psychiatrist's praxis. The main interest has been to orientate the whole way of treatment-beginning with intake interview in the psychiatrist's praxis continuing in some cases with an offer of immediate behavioral therapy-at those principles the modern behavior therapy commonly uses. Those kinds of \"behavioral\" problem analyses the outpatient unit for behavior modification University Clinic Hamburg has developed the last ten years have been very helpful; further the different kinds of exposure in real life (in vivo) situations, but also exposure in sensu seemed to be applicable; both because of offering immediate help without looking at sex, age, socio-economic status.","2789":"Highlighting the development of in-patient psychoanalytical therapy the insufficiency of traditional therapeutical conceptions (\"out-patient psychoanalysis in the hospital\", \"bipolar model of in-patient psychotherapy\") in view of increasing numbers of patients with ego-structural disorders in psychosomatoses and borderline pathologies become clear. Their manifold splitting tendencies toward any conceptual distinction of the psychoanalytical session with its transferential processes on the one hand and the \"actual\" milieu of the ward on the other hand. This fact will be taken into account only by the integrative inpatient psychoanalytical therapy which contrasts the group of patients with the therapeutical team. Only this theoretical constellation may grasp the dynamic processes which the individual patient as well as the whole group of patients but also the individual therapist and his team are undergoing. On this basis interventions will become particularly effective. - The method is illustrated by a description of the setting and a casuistry. A necessary broadening in view of the patients' environment outside the ward and of the bounds of the procedure are described. - Summing up we can say that the integrative inpatient psychoanalytical treatment for the first time provides an approach to the group of severe personality disorders which up to now could not be treated and at best were exposed to an expert rating.","2790":"The problem of compliance is compared against that of noncompliance, these two phenomena being fundamentally different from each other and depending also on different factors. A cross-sectional investigation of schizophrenic patients showed that compliant patients do not differ from the noncompliant ones with regard to the number of subjectively experienced negative drug effects but with regard to the number of subjectively experienced positive drug effects. These findings are interpreted in such a manner that patients are less likely to be prevented from complying with a treatment by the negative effects of that treatment and are more likely to cooperate because of positive therapy expectations. The question as to what represents positive therapy experiences, is discussed, as well as the problem of promoting an understanding between the physician and the patient in respect of this important aspect of therapy.","2791":"A wealth of research indicates equal or even superior psychotherapeutic effects of lay-persons in comparison to professional therapists. Detailed analysis of process and effects however is needed. Results of the first period (4 months) of a longer controlled psychiatric therapy and rehabilitation project are presented. One out of four groups was run by psychiatrically unexperienced lay therapists. Objective behavior and subjective experiences as well of therapists as of patients were assessed by means of continuous observation, rating- and attitude-scales, sociographical methods and interviews. Results confirm the therapeutic change-potential of lay-persons and give interesting findings on the therapeutic process itselves.","2792":"It is unfortunate that mental patients with long-term hospitalisation patterns are still necessarily scheduled for long-term stay in mental hospitals and institutions designed for the care and treatment of psychiatric cases, since such institutions are characterized by a rather sterile, low-stimulation atmosphere underlining rather than relieving the severity of the disease. This article presents a possible alternative, namely, care of mental patients within the framework of a foster family; these patients has been hospitalised for a long time and are now living in families who are remunerated for their efforts and are given medical assistance in performing their task as hosts. An attempt is made to describe the initial work in setting up such host patterns, particularly during the first year after initiation of the scheme, and to point out the mistakes that were committed and the resulting re-orientation efforts. Case reports on host families and \"guests\" illustrate the principles of psychiatric family care.","2793":"A sample of 45 schizophrenic (DSM-III) inpatients was used to investigate which types of behavior were experienced by family members during the first weekend leave as an emotional strain, and how this strain relates to the patients' symptoms. No type of behavior predominated in being found particularly disturbing: the strain was distributed evenly over all pathological behaviors. Estimation of pathological symptoms by nursing staff and therapists immediately before weekend leave did not predict the emotional load on family members. These results lead to the recommendation that patients' behavior on a psychiatric ward should not be used to make broad predictions about difficulties that will be experienced in family relationships. A better judgment will be obtained by sending patients home for trial periods and holding subsequent discussions with family members as well as patients.","2794":"This paper outlines the controlling principles of practice when working with groups of relatives and\/or family members to help schizophrenics to master their lives and to assist in preventing relapses. Emphasis is on the importance of giving valuable assistance to the relatives in their therapeutic role. Questions regarding the conceptual basis, the formation and management and the transfer to the care of self-help groups are dealt with. Finally, the article reviews previous studies on the therapeutic efficiency of self-help and family groups.","2795":"","2796":"The following study on family groups of patients with Huntington's chorea shows the changed psychosocial life patterns resulting from the disease of the marriage partner, as seen from the viewpoint of the other partner. It is evident that \"family groups\" are not necessarily self-sustaining, and cannot manage the additional strain without outside help; as a matter of fact, the limits of familial self-help become very apparent if the partner cannot cope with the burden. In this manner, family groups actually emphasise and underline the need for external social support.","2797":"The city of Bremen is divided into 5 catchment areas (\"sectors\") for the care of psychiatric patients. Internal sectorization of the mental hospital was introduced by relating certain wards to certain catchment areas. The development of internal sectorization and its impact on the diagnostic and therapeutic work in the hospital as well as on the cooperation with external services is described. Some data on patient flows are given. In addition we report on the results of an inquiry in psychiatric hospitals regarding sectorization and other forms of community oriented psychiatric care in the Federal Republic of Germany. The literature on sectorization as one principle of community psychiatry is overviewed.","2798":"17 unselected patients suffering from severe neurotic and borderline troubles were examined before and after treatment in a day-hospital. The examinations consisted of clinical and psychometric tests inclusive self-judgement. 12 patients showed a slight to considerable recovery, 2 patients felt more ill than before. The results are discussed on different points of view, and compared with other ones.","2799":"In spite of our determination to do so, we did not succeed in keeping an open door in a psychiatric admission unit treating patients of all kinds except during one third of the investigation period of 2.75 years duration. A total of 11.3% of all admissions prompted a transitory closing of the door, mostly for 3-4 days. A comparison with a control group shows an over-representation of young, schizophrenic, and organically damaged persons among these patients; in the case of the organics the closing of the ward was of substantially longer duration. The most frequent reason for closing the unit was the apprehension the patient would leave the hospital. However, as these patients were not dangerous towards themselves or against others, there may have been social rather than strictly medical grounds for this action. A short hospitalization time along with a high turn-over of the patients affect the possibility of influencing them on a relational level and make it thus more difficult to keep the door of an acute admission unit permanently open.","2800":"The public health office is analysed as an administration of peoples health with its structure and function. By aiming at the order of health, not at the pathology of an inner world, it guarantees - paradoxically enough - for a reservation of individual disorder. This structure corresponds with the clients' coping strategies and represents the condition of a problematic coexistence. By three cases it is demonstrated how different configurations of order develop from these conditions.","2801":"119 so-called \"long-term\" hospitalised patients (more than 4 months stay in the hospital) have been described by the records of illness and the AMDP documentation system. They were also examined 1 year after discharge. 92.5% of the \"long-term\" patients have been classified as \"improved\" or \"well improved\" when leaving the hospital. 1 year later 51.6% of those patients showed the same psychopathological state, 14.3% showed a better state and 28.6% had decreased. 5 patients had committed suicide. The family situation had improved only for 10% of the patients and 8.1% showed a decrease. The professional level of 20.9% decreased. Only 8.2% where able to improve themselves. The \"typical long-term patient\" suffers from a schizoaffective or affective psychosis. He is either between 18 and 29 or older then 60 years. He is unmarried, and has never or only few times been in hospital before. He leaves the hospital after long stay as \"improved\" or \"well improved\". One year later this success by a long-term indoor-treatment proved still to be stabile with 2\/3 of the patients. The results are compared with those in literature and the problem of \"long-term\" hospitalisation is discussed.","2802":"More and more chronic mental patients live in the communities and are jobless. Most of them cannot be expected to become gainfully employed in the near future, but the aim of all efforts should always be a permanent working place or at least meaningful activity. Due to the multitude of institutions participating in rehabilitation work the only chance of maximum utilisation of available chances can be achieved only by a local rehabilitation team. The article discusses the available scientific data on evaluation, success prediction, environmental structuralization and organisation of psychiatric working area.","2803":"In a catamnestic follow-up study of 226 patients treated psychotherapeutically in Chestnut Lodge on an inpatient basis, two-thirds of the schizophrenics and one-third of the patients with affective disorder presented with an unfavourable course. Since the schizophrenics had a chronic type of schizophrenia, this result agrees largely with the general course of schizophrenia. Although it is a disappointing result, it does away with both myths and distorted stories told about Chestnut Lodge. Social considerations as well as those based on institution analysis and on family therapy led to the thesis that the external reality of life of the schizophrenic patient is involved in deciding his possibilities of development even if the therapeutic approach is based on intrapsychic factors. The institutional nature of Chestnut Lodge, involving care and exclusion, was an obstacle to fulfilling Chestnut Lodge's claim that the conditions for an experimental trial in psychotherapy of schizophrenia (which aims at uncovering and understanding the patient's disturbed subjectiveness) are fulfilled only by a type of social psychiatry that allows the patient to solve the task of mastering his life in an adequate manner.","2804":"Occupational activity was studied in a representative sample of 450 patients from 5 in- and out-patient psychiatric institutions: among the patients of working age 16.5% were unemployed, 11.9% received social relief, and 13.9% were on a premature retirement pension, i.e. all in all 42.3% had to give up occupational activity prematurely. Only 30.1% were gainfully employed. An analysis of the results according to diagnosis showed particularly schizophrenic patients to be at a disadvantage (highest rate of premature retirement pensioners, lowest rate of employers), as well as alcoholics (highest rate of unemployment). The occupational situation of neurotic and psychosomatic patients was affected in a less degree. The data were compared to those of the general population. Psychiatric patients, we had to confirm, are particularly at a disadvantage when unemployment is generally high. Another important factor, however, seems to be that patients, their families, doctors and employers estimate capacity of performance on account of the specific illness, thus calling for intensified efforts toward rehabilitation.","2805":null,"2806":"Work therapy, or ergotherapy, is a recognised and permanent part of psychiatric treatment and medical rehabilitation. It is also an essential part of psychiatric diagnosis and therapy; furthermore, it enables the patient to develop and stabilise a realistic image of himself and contributes to the prevention and reduction of damage caused by hospitalism. The present status of work therapy was checked in 74 psychiatric hospitals throughout the Federal Republic of Germany, resulting in the need for further development of present practical procedures. A working group was created by the Federal Ministry of Labour and National Welfare within the framework of the model programme for psychiatry, at the suggestion of a Federal Working Group of the organisations running public mental hospitals in the FRG. The aim of this working group was to develop a specialised concept of work therapy. The group consisted of experts from clinical practice as well as from the Federal German Labour Office Institution, psychiatric consultants of the Federal Government and the Land Governments, as well as from the Land Government sponsors of state social welfare services. The \"Guidelines for Work Therapy in Psychiatric Hospitals and Departments of Psychiatry\" are officially considered to be a suitable basis for further development work in the field of ergotherapy.","2807":"","2808":"Patients with anorexia nervosa often refuse therapy and deny their organic and psychological state of disease. In doing so they are often supported by their parents who as well assume an ambivalent attitude towards therapy. If the family still refuses assenting to therapy after having been confronted with the severe consequences of this disease, the therapist has to decide by himself whether he initiates inpatient treatment even against the patient's will - so far as his life is in danger. According to Crisp (1980) anorectic patients have the right to intense and even compulsory treatment, as their refusal has to seen as part of their psychopathology. In 5 out of 85 inpatients we started therapy against the patients' and partly even the parents' will. All these cases had a prehistory of several therapy attempts and dropouts. Despite our compulsory measures it was possible to enter into an alliance with the patient and to initiate a positive course of illness. In any case, compulsory treatment has to be carefully considered. None the less, if the patient is in a life-threatening condition the therapist has to be aware of his responsibility without expecting therapy motivation from patients who are not able to meat this expectation because of their somatic and psychological symptomatology.","2809":"The question of what role genetic factors have in the transmission of suicidal behaviour, in particular suicide itself, is discussed on the basis of four studies of an epidemiologically clearly defined region (the Bundesland Salzburg). The high percentage of suicide positive family histories as compared to the literature are due to exceptionally good sources of information. It could be shown that in suicide cases which were also suffering from endogenous depression, both endogenous psychoses and suicides appeared to a greater extent in their families. In contrast to current assumptions, however, the suicide disposition is not just found in those with endogenous psychoses, but shows a separate genetic determination. The author concludes, without wanting to generalize prematurely, that the genetic factor in suicide research and in the evaluation of suicidality equally be respected as are psychodynamic and sociodynamic factors.","2810":"Whereas doctors and nurses in a psychiatric hospital are compelled, on the one hand, to prevent a mental patient from committing suicide (which may entail quite considerable restriction of freedom of movement and action), they may find it necessary on the other hand to grant him a certain amount of freedom as an adjuvant to therapy. It has been said that one may well fear that the compulsion to prevent suicide completely over rules therapy as such, and hence that official legislation is an obstacle to full utilisation of existing chances of cure, since it requires doctors and nurses to prevent suicide as the first and foremost consideration. This fear, however, is unfounded. Rather, the psychiatrist is called upon to weight the suicide risk against the chances of cure under less strict supervision in individual cases that appear suitable for following such a procedure. This conclusion is based on legal theoretical deliberations and is in line with judgements pronounced by Federal German Supreme Courts.","2811":"With the present investigation of clients (admissions in 1980) of a psychiatric crisis intervention center we intended generally a description of the population and especially a characterization of the diagnostical group \"psychogenic reaction\" (ICD No. 309\/308). That diagnostical group differs in many signs significantly from the group of alcohol and drug addicts (ICD No. 303\/304). Differences to other diagnostical groups (like neurosis, personality disorders e.g., ICD-No. 300, 301, 306) we elaborated only for some factors. Predominantly we worked with a self-made open questionnaire and an objectivated test (FAPK = Questionnaire for psychosomatic disorders). As main conflict constellations of the patients we noticed personal and social isolation and relationship disorders. Our results in crisis provoking situations are in accordance with those of the life-event-research. The therapeutical consequences are discussed.","2812":"On 7 January 1981 a special ward for crisis intervention and emergency psychiatric cases went on stream at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich. The article reports on the development of this ward between 1981 and 1985. First of all, a brief outline of the structure of the ward is given explaining indications and contraindications for acceptance and the treatment concept. This is followed by statistical evaluation of 1981 to 1985 data in respect of number of admissions and readmissions, duration of stay, percentage distribution of the referring institutions, age distribution, distribution of diagnosis, rates of attempted and committed suicides and onward referral to other institutions for further treatment. Finally, the article reviews changes in the basis concept of therapy and in the style of communication and behaviour within the therapeutic team, besides commenting on unfavourable conditions.","2813":"Psychiatric emergencies and life crises are located at opposite ends of a broad scale of stages requiring acute help: Emergency cases need immediate medical care in order to prevent danger to life. For the same reason, immediate hospital admission and additional treatment of risks of internal medicine have to be provided, if necessary. Crises often have not only mental but also social aspects. The immediate urgency of treatment is determined by the psychiatric (suicidal) or the physical risk. Emergency cases and severe crises require a 24-hour medical service. Social aspects cannot be settled in the night-time, even if they are urgent. Emergency and crisis intervention services with a multidisciplinary staff therefore ascribe different roles to physicians, nurses and social workers. Since 1976, the Central Institute of Mental Health provides a 24-hour crisis intervention and emergency service both at the Institute and at the emergency ward of the Mannheim University General Hospital. Within few years, the number of treated episodes has increased to 1,800-1,900 per year. The distance between the place of work or residence is a decisive factor of service utilization. Over 50% of the users of the emergency and crisis intervention service are mentally ill. Only a small part are contacts for crises without psychiatric disorder. Suicidal attempts or intentions account for about 30% of the service users, marriage crises for about 25% and alcohol problems also for about 25%. The development of complementary care in Mannheim has led to a parallel increase in the proportion of chronically mentally ill living in complementary facilities. This clearly indicates that a 24-hour emergency and crisis intervention service is a compulsory prerequisite for the implementation of an efficient system of complementary care for the mentally ill.","2814":"The study presented here concerns the multidimensional inpatient treatment of schizophrenics with client centered psychotherapeutic emphasis. All cases that occurred in the course of one year are analysed where treatment had been discontinued during the first thirty days or who had to be transferred to an acute cases ward because of exacerbation of the psychotic pattern of symptoms and\/or suicidal tendencies. There was a massed occurrence of treatment complications if the patients were particularly young, if they were of the male sex, if the duration of disease was relatively short and if the directly preceding inpatient pretreatment had lasted for a particularly long time. Another unfavourable factor was a particularly marked acuity of the diseases or if minus symptoms were most conspicuous, if neuroleptic medication had to be effected at high level, and especially if this medication was rapidly cut down at the time treatment was changed and also if motivation of treatment was poor or lacking. It is the aim of this study to give a more precise indication for inpatient rehabilitation treatment with emphasis on psychotherapy, to point out its limitations and to recognise and help to avoid treatment errors.","2815":"The strain to which relatives of schizophrenics are subjected is described on the basis of communications received from relatives of schizophrenic patients of the psychiatric hospital in which the authors of this article work. Relief can be offered to the relatives via two types of groups of relatives made up as follows: \"Short-term\" information groups for relatives of patients who have the disease for the first time, and \"long-term\" groups for relatives of schizophrenics with a repeated record of hospitalisation. The work done by such a \"long term\" group is described: A subject-centred group of relatives without patients with decreasing frequency of attendance by group leaders after one year and topic orientation according to concrete everyday tasks of living together. The formation of these groups of relatives aims at affording relief to those relatives who are largely depressed and feel isolated because of the burden that has been placed on them by the patient, to provide them with information and to offer a system of mutual learning to acquire a relaxed way of approach and dealing with the patient which will reduce the likelihood of relapses. Other possibilities of affording relief to the relatives are described, such as certain days on which relatives can meet with each other and with the doctors and nurses in the hospital to discuss all problems the relatives have to tackle and which, they feel, bear them down. These \"days of the relatives\" have proved very successful and have been giving a lot of encouragement to the families concerned.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2816":"The Department of Social Psychiatry at the Free University of Berlin offers a mode of treatment that comprises semi-inpatient, complementary and outpatient treatment in close cooperation with facilities for full inpatient treatment. This relatively comprehensive system is examined for its patient flow. The authors observed over a period of three years to what extent patient flow followed lines as recommended in literature for step-by-step rehabilitation and flexible retransfer. Furthermore the differences in utilising the system by first admissions and readmissions to the Department are described.","2817":"The results of a catamnestic study concerning patients of a psychiatric rehabilitation unit are reported. The patients were either longterm inpatients (mean duration of stay 8.5 years) or those, who had been transferred from the acute unit for lack of therapeutic progress and thus were probable to become longterm patients. Half the patients of the first and two third of the patients of the second group could be dismissed, living alone, with their families or in home accommodations. In a very few cases occupational rehabilitation could be achieved. Predictors of good outcome were higher age of the patient at first admission to a psychiatric hospital, longer duration of occupational practise, preserved contact to the family and pecuniary security warranted by a disablement pension. Further improvements of in- and outpatient psychiatric care are discussed.","2818":"The wide therapeutic spectrum of benzodiazepines is well known. This is due to its neuropharmacological, e.g. anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic, muscle relaxing and anticonvulsant effects. The existence of an antidepressive effect could not be proven up till now. The anxiolytic and the hypnotic effects are considered as the most important events. But it has to be pointed out that the pharmacotherapy of anxiety is only one of the therapeutic approaches towards the problem. A way how to deal with anxiety and other problems could be well discussed and supported in Balint-groups, which are widely offered especially for those, who have not been trained in psychotherapy. Unfortunately a misuse of benzodiazepines is still widely existing. Especially after longer treatment the patients often become addicted to the drugs. Therefore we suggest a thorough consideration of these side effects before any long term treatment with benzodiazepines is decided.","2819":"The authors report first clinical experiences with 28 schizophrenic patients who were treated and socially rehabilitated by a specially selected team in a small, stimulus-protected, continuous, open and community-near environment (therapeutic community \"Soteria Bern\"). The therapeutic concept is based on the vulnerability- and information-processing hypothesis and on further psycho-, socio- and milieutherapeutic experiences with schizophrenics. Neuroleptic drugs were used in comparatively very small doses. With about 2\/3 positive outcomes, the first results are encouraging. In a research project over several years they will be systematically compared with more traditional treatment strategies.","2820":"We report about 3 1\/2 years experience with sheltered apartments in Bern Switzerland. Now 53 psychiatric ex-patients have been living in 9 apartments. After a survey of the literature, we describe the organizational model and the goals of the project. A big mental state hospital and a small social-psychiatric service with different needs and views of the problems work together. The two different groups of residents, their social- and illness-data are analyzed and compared. Indications, the expense of care and the results are described. The most important effect seems to be the reduction of the need of hospitalization p.a. in the group of residents in a ratio of 10 to 1.","2821":"The authors evaluated in a retrospective study the sociodemographic and sickness course specific data of 48 patients who had been discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment to an outpatient residential community. Whereas in 50% of the patients after an average time in the community of 1 1\/2 years it is usually possible for them to move into a home of their own, provided their mental condition has continued to stabilise, the other half of the patients have to be readmitted to the psychiatric hospital as inpatients, thus breaking off their ties to the residential community. Relevant criteria of prognosis are, in consideration of the medium-term rehabilitation success in the residential community, the duration and number of times of previous psychiatric hospitalisations and the age of the patient when the disease became manifest for the first time. No prognosis of rehabilitation success is possible on the basis of duration of stay in the residential community, previous professional activity, age and psychiatric diagnosis (endogenous psychoses versus personality disturbances and other syndromes).","2822":"In the present paper, we report about a 2-year-experience with in-patient withdrawal of alcohol addicts. Out of 465 addicted pts., 178 pts. were treated with oral Clomethiazol. No delirium was observed during a mean treatment period of 6.6 days. 39 pts. who were delirious at admission, were also treated with oral Clomethiazol. In all of these pts., the delirium disappeared within 3-4 days. Possible explanations for these favourable courses will be discussed. Early and sufficient treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome with Clomethiazol seems to be one of the major factors in treating and avoiding delirium.","2823":"The study concerns the social situation of alcoholics after a 3- to 6-weeks in-patient withdrawals. As central question appears that for the influence of the social situation on treatment outcome. We distinguish between the life-subjects work and occupation, partnership, spare time, living situation, financial situation and official and judicial problems. In order to register the treatment outcome we had catamnestic interviews 3 months after the patients left the hospital. The sample consist of 48 patients. The most important result is: the more disadvantageous the social situation, the patients relapse. Having an employment, a good partnership and enough income is must important for the treatment outcome.","2824":"Detoxified alcoholics in psychiatric hospitals of a West German large city are investigated with regard to the question who of them get recommendations for further rehabilitation: to take part in a self help group or therapy. Patient documentations of two years are analysed. Results show that few detoxified alcoholics get advice for further rehabilitation. These persons are socially more integrated than those without advice.","2825":"With a detailed case report of a patient suffering from kleptomania with neurotic causes, we are trying to obtain more detailed information about such patients' psychodynamics. The case history is preceded by a discussion of the concept of kleptomania. We give a list of the descriptive-empirical papers which prove that one cannot speak of an independent clinical picture, but rather that the kleptomaniac actions may be a symptom of multiple causes. Following the case history, the psychodynamics of this patient is discussed and compared with the existing interpretations, based on depth psychology, of other patients. We confirm the opinion expressed by other authors that kleptomania with neurotic causes is to be classified amongst the impulse neuroses. We criticize the fact that in the presently existing psychodynamic interpretation the sexual symbolism of the theft actions and of the stolen goods themselves has been overvalued. In an ego-psychological consideration, we then draw the attention to these patients' desperate and greedy search for an object which helps them to maintain control over their own destructive aggressiveness and at the same time preserves the object. Subsequently, we suggest distinguishing between two groups of kleptomaniac patients who can be differentiated with regard to their symptoms and psychodynamics. Some kleptomaniacs seem to be \"fixed\" on special objects when stealing. Others give the impression of being \"de-differentiated\" by the way they steal. In the latter group the structural ego weakness is the most important feature. These psychodynamic considerations are included in the forensicpsychiatric discussion of kleptomania at the end of this paper. Several criteria are presented, e.g., the symptomatic character of the patients' behaviour, the compulsion to repeat, the progredience of the symptoms, the de-differentiation of personality, which are to contribute to the evaluation of the independence and the automatism of the action with regard to the possibility of a patients' ego control.","2826":"The incidence of recidivism and the dangerous nature of punishable offences committed by patients compulsorily hospitalised in psychiatric institutions in lieu of imprisonment, as prescribed by the German penal code, was the subject of a critical study carried out over 20 years among a population of criminally convicted men hospitalised at Haar District Psychiatric Hospital between 1962 and 1981. This study is intended to tone down emotionalised discussions on alleged public risks involved in relaxing restrictive measures for mentally diseased offenders. The results of our study would not justify revoking any steps already taken towards relaxation of conditions under which these offenders are serving their sentence, provided the safety risk is carefully weighed in each case before using more liberal treatment methods, and is assessed in relation to the expected therapeutic benefit.","2827":"Article 64 of the Penal Code of the Federal Republic of Germany provides for the commitment of alcohol and drug addicts to special institutions if further severe offences are to be expected due to their addiction. The measure of correction cannot be applied if treatment endeavours are given no chance. As the lack of compliance very often only appears in the course of the treatment, an amendment was made which added a new article. According to the new legal regulations, the measure of correction can be annulled after one year of detainment if the addict shows no aptitude for the therapy. The new regulation implicates an intensification of the therapeuticts role conflict, which is based on the fact that coerced therapy was little chance to be successful. Before establishing the deficient therapeutical capability of a patient, it should be conscientiously verified how far a team conflict or an insufficient therapeutical offer determines the decision. It should be considered that possibly one only wants to get rid of a troublesome patient.","2828":"For several years now a working team of judges and physicians has been tackling the questions involved in the compulsory hospitalisation of mentally diseased patients. In the course of this teamwork the deficiencies and drawbacks of hospitalisation legislation have become glaringly evident. The problems of hospitalisation by law and under the legislation practised by Guardianship Courts, are compared by juxtaposition. It will be necessary to employ the principles of family law if the principle of care and need of treatment should receive priority over that of the potential danger to society (which dominates present hospitalisation legislation). However, before any adequate measures can be taken, it will be absolutely necessary to effect essential changes in the \"law on care and protection of mentally ill patients\" that has been in force in North Rhine Westphalia since the end of 1969. It will also be necessary to change the practices observed in enforcing this law.","2829":"Only few patients after suicide attempt are examined by a psychiatrist. In order to intensify the primary psychiatric care of suicide attempters, a psychiatric liaison scheme was established at an intensive care unit of the Technical University, Munich. The main advantages are: A psychiatrist talks with every suicide attempter; the psychiatrist and the medical staff are better informed about the suicidal act and the personality of the suicide attempter because of close cooperation; there is more time for diagnostic and psychotherapeutic activities; suicide risk diminishes while staying on the medical ward. If a psychiatric liaison scheme cannot be established it should be tried to change ward atmosphere by advising the medical staff and offering emotional support.","2830":"The evaluation of psychiatric histories of 56 women from the age of 45 to 60 diagnosed as monopolar depressions demonstrates the incongruence of natural-scientific and interpreting (hermeneutic) competence. In 60% of the cases no details about the gynecological anamnesis could be found; in 36% informations about the sexual selfperception by the patients were available; these informations were not placed under a specific category of anamnesis but scattered throughout the text and left a exigency of interpretation. Gynecological pains in a wider sense appeared in half of the cases. These datas are put in the frame of a specific, socially preformed idea of female aging, which indeed gives place to the here studied depressive syndrome, but not to a suitable mode of expression according to age, sexual desire resp. female individuality. The term of \"ideal motherliness\", i.e. a motherliness without the obligation to produce children, is introduced here as a possible therapeutic and social criticism. The interdependence of sexual mode of expression on one side, which is granted or not granted from a certain age on, of psychiatric symptoms becoming relevant and a fitting niche on the other is called 'ecology' with regard to the said background and according to Bateson. So the dysfunctional stabilization of the patient is regarded as a reflexive kind of way.","2831":"In retrospect, several phases of the healing process are easily distinguishable: Initiated with a terminal inpatient antidepressant therapy, continued by a tranquilizer-hypnotic withdrawal treatment, the psychotherapeutic mastering of the life-crises which provoked the mental disturbance in the first place, then the patient's going back to work, and, finally, the total mental stabilization on a mature level. The psychopathologic and psychosomatic symptoms appearing in the process are interpreted as expressions of spontaneous healing and not to be confounded with symptoms of withdrawal and\/or relapse. The transition of the disturbance suffered and vanquished into a new self-image terminates the process of healing and recovery.","2832":"The effects of age on sex differences in depression were studied in an inpatient-sample of the Department of Psychiatry, Free University Berlin. The dependent variable depression was defined by nosological classification (ICD) and by the severity of the Depressive Syndrome of the AMP-Rating Scale on admission. With the exception of the 40-49 years olds women were more often diagnosed as depression compared to men, the preponderance of women was significant till the age of 40. With regard to the Depressive Syndrome women manifested a more pronounced symptomatology up to the age of 70. The difference diminished for male and female patients 50-69 years old and changed to a higher score for men older than 70. The results were discussed in comparison to other findings published in the last years.","2833":"295 attempted suicides with intoxication are described by sociodemographic, biographic, and psychiatric characteristics. The patients were hospitalized for detoxification, and after clearing up interviewed by a psychiatrist working in the hospital as a liaison-psychiatrist. The patients did not differ essentially from patients treated in the emergency unit of another general hospital of the city in terms of basic social data. The patients--65% women, 35% men--are young (up to 40 years), 39% had already attempted suicide before the index-time. 41% came from \"broken homes\", 40% had one or more psychiatric disease(s) in their families. 56% were diagnosed as \"psychiatrically ill\", second diagnosis was in 33.5% abuse of alcohol\/drugs. The referal offer to the patients for the time after discharge from emergency unit is described in detail. Just 12% of the patients were treated in a psychiatric hospital, after-care in an ambulatory setting seemed to be sufficient for most of the other patients. 20% were not offered any after-care. Patients with addiction and psychosis were sent to institutions specialized for these diagnoses.","2834":"In Limburg, Netherlands, a project is going on aiming to implement lower class-linked skill-therapies into the regional mental health services. This article elucidates: the poor relationship that exists between contemporary psychotherapy and the lower class clients; various efforts that have been attempted to solve this problem; the basic elements of Goldstein's 'structured learning therapy'; activities and results of the Dutch 'Goldsteinproject'.","2835":"Paradoxical approaches to psychotherapy have reemerged with the development of family therapy. But these techniques are also pertinent to Behaviour Therapy. An historical outline is given. Indication and relevant techniques are described and illustrated with case histories. The ethics of Paradoxical Therapy are discussed.","2836":"We report about a psychotherapeutic approach of intervention with patients suffering of severe cardiac neurosis. The patients treated had panic attacks almost every night. The patients learned cognitive strategies in combination with a self-controlled stimulus exposition. In addition an analysis of the individual learning history was made. We found an anxious, dominant mother in 8 of 10 cases. Two patients had a foster-mother. Six married patients had a tendency of separation and a fear of separation as well. In these cases we recommended a marital therapy or an individual therapy after our hospital treatment. All treated patients lost the panic attacks; agoraphobic tendencies were reduced as well--no longer impairing their every day life. In five cases all clinical symptoms had disappeared completely. In all cases we found the improvements persisting 6 months after treatment.","2837":"First the paper presents an explanation for psychogenous sleep disturbances, basing on coincidence of psychophysiological and biorhythmical sleep patterns with special cognitive and emotional variables. Related thereto a concept for prevention and psychotherapy of these sleep disturbances is elaborated. Both concepts content five structuring elements, standing in a circular feed back relationship: 1. subjective misconceptions about the nature of sleep, 2. dysfunctional norms and goals for the own sleep, 3. cognitive misevaluations of the experienced sleep events, 4. development of a dysfunctional self concept, 5. development of dysfunctional patterns and goals of behavior for coping sleep problems. The elements display the structure for development and diagnosis of these sleep disturbances and for the preventive and psychotherapeutic work. Finally, related to this concept, therapeutic strategies were presented, basing on cognitive and behavior therapy.","2838":"","2839":"The purpose of this article is to stimulate a discussion on the present-day contribution made by research in non-university psychiatric hospitals and its possible achievements if these hospitals were better equipped with funds. The senior physicians of such hospitals and of the Departments of Psychiatry of General Hospitals were asked in writing to find out present research activities. The following topics represented focal points of research: Evaluation of psychiatric care structures, Therapy, Psychiatry and legislation, Personnel, Family members, self-help, non-professionals. The article goes into detail in selected cases in respect of research foci and methods. Pointers are given to problems requiring further research with regard to psychiatric care structures.","2840":"The concrete reasons for a stationary admission in a psychiatric clinic and a psychiatric university hospital have been investigated. Evidential differences appeared at the age of the subjects and at the reasons for their admission: The psychiatric clinic admitted more agitated, desorientated, and intoxicated patients. More self-motivated addicts, calm persons suffering from delusions, and patients for diagnostic clarification, however, were admitted into the university clinic. Furthermore, the examination enabled to realize typical constellations between certain reasons for admission and the diagnoses. As to the duration of the treatment there were no important differences to ascertain between the two investigated clinics. Differences, however, were to realize when considering the duration of treatment according to the diagnoses.","2841":"The following article reports findings concerning a man who first developed symptoms in his late twenties that were later diagnosed as bilateral basal ganglia calcification. The man, now 53 years of age, shows symptoms of an alteration of his personality with despondency and nearly a total loss of drive. Earlier clinical reports assumed that the man's condition was due to a deterioration of his intelligence. The findings presented here, however, show that he had a normal IQ, and that the supposed deterioration of intelligence was only due to his loss of drive.","2842":"The symbiontic psychosis of an elderly married couple is described, which was based on delusions of jealousy held by the inducing, tardive schizophrenic wife. Acceptance of the delusion by the egoweak, psycho-organically impaired husband had far-reaching consequences (surgical castration, treatment with anti-androgens). Special attention is paid to psychopathology as well as to psychodynamic and semiotic aspects of the delusional illness.","2843":null,"2844":null,"2845":"The authors report on the activities of a female consultant with psychosocial orientation acting within the framework of a practising lady paediatrician's medical activities. The paediatrician refers patients or families to the social sciences consultant who studied paedagogics, sociology and psychology and who is so to say part of the paediatric consultation work. This amounts to an approach to an integrated type of treatment. It is an attempt to extend the old therapeutic concept of \"disease\", which has been mainly directed at cure and at treating the human organism, via practical interaction between various fields of human activity. Paediatric medicine lends itself quite easily to such an approach on the basis of experience collected in the course of time. The authors give a systematised description of the consultant practice, showing the boundary-lines of competencies. A few practical cases are outlined. The authors consider this set-up as an attempt to effect structural improvements of general medical care.","2846":"The author describes the characteristic environment and afterwork leisure hours of a mentally handicapped woman residing in a hostel for mentally handicapped adults. Such hostels are described and presented as one of the possibilities of accommodating such individuals. These hostels are described as small-scale projects close to the original district in which the patients had grown up, the ultimate aim being the social integration of the inmates. The hostels in question were erected as homesteads for mentally handicapped adults who are mainly engaged in working in a sheltered workshop. The working principles are described, followed by an outline of the development of homesteads in the Federal Republic, listing the available capacities and future requirements. In addition, legal pointers are also given, besides a description of aspects of financing and constructional problems and of the tasks of residents and staff. From the description of a few essential structural and conceptional problems in this field, the article arrives at important demands to be made in future to both government and society. The article then points out the possibilities of continuing to set up suitable hostels for mentally handicapped adults in spite of strained financial budgets of the state and of the local communities. In the author's opinion, chances are offered by improving the cooperation between building societies and communities to ensure adequate housing in accordance with regional requirements.","2847":"As already described in Part I, the rigid structures of treatment in psychiatric hospitals were largely abandoned in the course of a sociopsychiatric experiment. This released initially both in the patients and in the psychiatric ward personnel (physicians and nurses) of the new hospital organization trends towards a common and highly pathological groups process aiming at reshaping or recreating the entire institution. This could be partly interpreted as a replay of a schizophrenic family conflict and induced subconsciously motivated tensions with the parent institution. In order to escape the ensuing tangle which became eventually intolerable for the medical personnel, structures were then introduced which could be interpreted as a compromise between protective bureaucratisation on the one hand and institutional psychotherapy on the other. This compromise resulted from a conflict within the medical personnel team. The trend towards protective bureaucracy experienced by many individuals of the medical personnel was so pronounced as a result of the counter reactions-transference that the structures of the new hospital organization would have largely fallen in line of those of the parent institution if the group of psychotherapists had not been as strong as it proved to be. This led us to believe that psychiatric hospitals in their capacity as institutions are almost exclusively in the service of defence mechanisms against psychotic entanglement or involvement tendencies and that they are thus more or less petrified products of institutionalised defence that, however, no longer obviously display the repulsed elements or the functions of repulsion and defence.","2848":"","2849":"Outpatient psychiatric care linked to a hospital or institution is as old as psychiatry defining itself as a science. During the time of the Liberal Movement in Germany and the various revolutions that took place in several European countries (including Austria and various German states) in 1848, people were full of ideas and sociorevolutionary projects. It was then that they became conscious of the need to meet mentally ill persons in their own environment in order to help them in an adequate manner. Griesinger described in great detail such work as envisaged by him for his projected \"municipal asylum\" or \"city asylum\". However, all efforts in this direction were quashed in 1868 by a majority decision on the part of psychiatrics in favour of large-scale lunatic asyluma located far away from the densely populated areas. At the turn of the century, social awareness again began to grow; the asylums were overcrowded; and costs had risen tremendously. This resulted in building up a non-institutionalised \"open service and care\" for the insane. On the one hand, it was an outpatient care system in close co-operation with the asylum, i.e. the patients were looked up in their homes (Erlangen Model), whereas in several big cities the community Public Health Office was responsible for such psychiatric care (Gelsenkirchen Model). In the German Republic that existed from 1919 to 1933, \"open\" psychiatric care was extended, and the psychiatrist who advocated it were gradually drawn into a maelstrom of a sociodarwinistic type of racialism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2850":"The author describes the importance and value of early stimulation within the overall concept of working with handicapped persons. A brief definition and scientific arguments are given. Data on the historical development of this relatively recent field are given considerable space, as are details on concepts and organisation. Problems and weak points of the system are pointed out. From the aspect of the fact that the family is the centre of child activities, it is important to make it quite clear that early stimulation of rehabilitation must be an interdisciplinary, \"open\" and holistic \"assistance\" system for parents and families as a whole. A point worth considering is whether the system, which had so far been restricted mainly to children with handicaps in somatic field, can also be extended to cover children whose handicaps are mainly caused by psychosocial factors.","2851":"Psychiatric reform in the northern Italian region of Piedmont following Law No. 180 is described. From 1977 to 1981 the overall psychiatric hospital inmate population is reduced from 5.544 to 2.396, the majority of patients discharged is now living in outpatient therapeutic communities, private psychiatric hostels and nursing homes. 76 community mental health centres with an average catchment area of 59.000 inhabitants and a medium of 250 patients as well as 21 psychiatric wards in general hospitals with a total of 253 beds are set up to substitute psychiatric hospitals. Inpatient admission and discharge numbers are stable in the years preceding and following law no. 180, private psychiatric hospitals decrease their proportion of total admission numbers from 49% (1975) to 40% (1980). Percentage of compulsory inpatient treatments falls from 30% (1975) to 6% (1980), duration of hospital treatment is drastically reduced. There is an integration of psychiatric services in the general health care system, utopic reform objectives have not been reached.","2852":"The traditional mental hospitals are said to hamper recovery and obstruct rehabilitation by an authoritarian therapeutic regimen. Nevertheless, the claim of community-oriented hospitals that a liberal therapeutic style improves prognosis and makes treatment more human requires scrutiny. The management of violent patients who call for controlling and disciplinary measures seems to be crucial. In the light of a case-history the article describes, how a misinterpretation of liberal principles complicates the treatment of dangerous patients and supports an attitude which does not admit the double character of psychiatric therapy in regard of the inevitable conflict between safety precautions and therapeutic engagement.","2853":"The discussion about Euthanasia newly has raised the question on the violent implications of interaction in psychiatry. Psychiatry is under obligation of the forces of order on one, of the wish to help on the other side. This double bind reflects an interactional feature of construction which the psychotic patient has to go through, but which he carries on too. The selfreduplicative construction of originally individual double bind-situations corresponds to the patient's conception of live, but evokes a specific, only perceptible at short notice, disintigrating \"double-bind-Wut\" in the involved therapist, which mainly is endangering the patient. The state of \"double-bind-Wut\" and the working up of this rage is determined by the primary process therefore directly unconscious. We investigate to what extent the \"double-bind-Wut\" is to make perceptible and thus to handle; by the means of casuistic microstructures we give reasons for the assumption that the desintrating power of \"double-bind-Wut\" might become a methodical paradigm of future research.","2854":"In the early beginnings of the constructional phase of a \"sociopsychiatric satellite\" of a rural psychiatric hospital where classical treatment parameters had been abandoned, signs were seen of trends towards a severely pathological group process which threatened to draw--induced by the patients--even the psychiatric attendants, nurses, helpers and physicians into the maelstrom of a mad interlock. At first, the sequence of events leading to this fateful climax remained largely below the threshold of consciousness. It became manifest by counter-transference reactions on the part of the psychiatric coworkers and generated creative powers which went beyond the processes described in literature in so far as they aimed at encompassing and sweeping along the institution as a whole. This prompts the author to suspect that the part played by the patients in the creation, shaping and routine reproduction of the institution known as \"psychiatric hospital\", has been underestimated up to now. After supplementary descriptions of the mutual involvement process in Part II, an attempt is made, in analogy to the concept of Mentzos, to describe the defence moves against such a pathological symbiosis as an essential part of psychiatric treatment institutions, especially of psychiatric hospitals or \"asylums\".","2855":"Community based out-care systems for the long term patient has been a concern ever since deinstitutionalization and rehabilitation became a task in the 60's. Much of our efforts failed. Here we try to make the point of organizational factors and their impact on motivation and cooperative incentives both for the staff in the wards, and in the community based clinics. Exchange theory is offered as a base to outline better planning.","2856":"Ten years ago an extensive behaviour therapy programme for the treatment of young opiate addicts was developed and tested, and shown through follow-ups extending over a period of two years to be successful. Some of the most important behaviour therapy procedures are introduced. A distinction is made between traditional methods which have been used since the beginning of the therapy programme and newer approaches in behaviour therapy, which in recent years have led to a broadening of the spectrum of therapy. In conclusion important areas for the treatment of opiate addicts in the future are dealt with, which make further improvements in the efficiency of therapy possible.","2857":"Suicidal modes of behaviour are discussed in their forensic-psychiatric aspects, and the problems of a typical case are presented as an example. As in other medical disciplines, questions of recognizability and correct treatment of pathological disorders are of particular interest from the legal point of view. The analysis of suicidal modes of behaviour in larger populations can admittedly demonstrate more or less typical patterns, but reliable parameters for individual prognosis are not available. For this reason, suicidal tendencies in the individual are in principle not recognizable. A standard psychiatric therapy with guaranteed success does not exist. We draw attention to the particular responsibility for accurate documentation of each case history.","2858":"On the average, every tenth proband dies during his compulsory referral to a psychiatric hospital decreed by a court of law. The mortality rate among sentenced persons is not only much higher than that of inmates of a normal prison, but is also much higher than among patients of psychiatric hospitals not compulsorily referred by court. Those who died during hospitalisation, were fully exculpated more often than those who survived at the end of their term; furthermore, they had served their sentences on the average for a longer time than the survivors. The combination of mental disease, legal culpability and imprisonment exercises a particularly dramatic effect on the suicide rate.","2859":null,"2860":"Forensic psychiatric institutions (mentally ill offenders) have not developed according to the recommendations of psychiatric experts as suggested in the 'Psychiatric Enquete'. Paragraph 65 StGB with its provisions was eliminated from the penal code on the 1. Jan. 1985, hence independent social-therapeutic institutions will not come into existence in the FRG. Taking the current institutional conditions into account the authors investigate the chances and possibilities of client-orientated treatment.","2861":"","2862":"The state of information and the public opinion concerning the epileptic's psychosocial rank in the West of Lower Austria are similar to the results in the Federal Republic of Germany in many respects. But on the other hand there are also many differences. Many of the interviewed ones reacted in the sense of \"centrality of concerness\". Questions concerning society in general, the answers were liberal and partly even outgoing. When the own persons or the own family got involved answers were significantly less positive than in Western Europe or the USA. Answers concerning employment of epileptics were reflecting the socio-economic situation of the different countries at the moment of the interview. If there was a better socio-economic background it also was easier to make a motion for employment of epileptics. The age-group between 30 and 40 years proved to be best informed and most outgoing.","2863":"An interview conducted with former patients verified whether or not the reasons for being discharged from hospital coincided with those of the therapists. There was only agreement in approximately 50% of the cases according to whether the patients demanded to be released or whether their discharge was ordered by the hospital. Agreement was found to be greater particularly in cases where further treatment was not considered to be necessary by the patients and where patients were assigned to medical treatment elsewhere. There was more agreement in cases where further care was regarded as not necessary by both--therapists and patients. Patients who believed that they themselves had terminated treatment judged the hospital in a more negative light, as was to be expected. Agreement was high between therapists and patient regarding the treatment which was conducted afterwards. In this case medical records transpired to be very reliable. The question why a model setting, which aims at a high consensus among the medical staff and patients, attains only limited agreement on the reasons and necessity for discharge from hospital, is discussed.","2864":null,"2865":null,"2866":"The article describes the cooperation of a Department of Psychiatry with an old people's center or a home for the aged, and the possibilities and difficulties experienced during such cooperation over a period of five years. The starting point of this co-operation was that both institutions required one another for coping with their work. We tried to make a virtue of necessity. Of course it would not be easy to transfer our kind of cooperation to any other institution. However, we would point out the following problems of cooperation and the developments experienced by us: An old people's home with care facilities is suitable as a complementary to a psychiatric hospital for the continuing treatment of very aged patients who are severely psychotic. In an old people's home with nursing facilities it should certainly be possible to translate into reality a comprehensive psychiatric care programme besides drug therapy, if the personnel is properly instructed and the ensuing conflicts are mastered, although the scope is bound to be limited by shortage of personnel. Instructions can consist of team discussions on individual cases, consultation hours, and emergency services; time must be allowed to help the patients as well as to advise the nurses. Such cooperation can be financed (in the Federal Republic of Germany) on the one hand by sickness insurance payments of medical services rendered to the patients, and on the other hand by a lumpsum to be included in the fees charged by the home, although such lumpsums cannot unfortunately cover all the activities and therapy group costs in a satisfactory way. Almost all the inmates of an old people's nursing home display some psychiatric abnormalities, although only about one-half of them require direct psychiatric treatment. The remaining patients can be stabilised by means of comprehensive psychiatric care based on an understanding of their conflicts and difficulties. Development of such cooperation between psychiatric hospital and old people's nursing home is not continuous. It takes place phasewise, frustration alternating with effectivity. The article describes the course of such development in detail.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","2867":"All long-term patients with the diagnosis \"paraphrenia systematica\" out of one region were included in this study. 53 patients were treated in an in-patient psychiatric unit between 1979 and 1981 and were available in this study. Parenteral Fluphenacin-Decanoate (25-75 mg monthly) was given. Before, during and after Fluphenacin (each schedule lasting for at least 20 weeks) psychopathological and social evaluations were done. We used quantitative scales: NGI (Nurses Global Impressions) and BPRS (Brief psychiatric Rating Scale). Good Socialization showed a striking correlation to parenteral Fluphenacin-treatment. Differences in the present state psychopathology were not able to explain the social difference. During parenteral treatment 49 patients switched from badly socialized (NGI: more than 12 points) to well socialized (NGI less than 7 points). 18 patients stopped parenteral neuroleptic treatment for various reasons. 13 Patients out of this group had to be readmitted to the psychiatric hospital, while those staying on their parenteral neuroleptic drug-treatment stayed well socialized.","2868":"The term \"Illness concept\" compromises all assumptions, interpretations, explanations, and predictions in regard to one's health status. Therapists and patients hold illness concepts which may differ from each other. Illness concepts can be described under formal, phenomenological and psychological-functional aspects. Illness concepts influence perception of illness, cooperation and satisfaction with treatment by the patient. To respect the illness concepts of patients means to respect the patient himself. The patient's perspectives are valuable completions of the therapist's perspectives and should, therefore, be integrated in the planning of therapy.","2869":"Interactions between psychopharmacological drugs and milieu factors are reported in the clinical and experimental literature as well. This seems not to be a very striking discovery since both, milieu and psychopharmaca do in fact influence human behaviour. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms on which this kind of interellations can be based. So some of the hypothetical pathways to be considered are briefly discussed.","2870":"The influence exercised by personality factors on the course and success of drug therapy aimed at the treatment of mental diseases, as well as the therapeutic consequences resulting therefrom, are discussed in the case of patients with schizophrenic psychoses and endogenous depressions. Over and above this, special attention is paid to the importance of changes in the patient's life balance in the course of long-term treatment, and to the influence of such changes on the treatment course.","2871":"A 22-year-old female patient developed agranulocytosis 26 days after starting single agent treatment with perazine. In accordance with the clinical and hematological picture this agranulocytosis is classified as antibody mediated with destruction of peripheral neutrophils. After cessation of perazine treatment and proper therapy of infection the patient recovered within two weeks. The diagnosis of agranulocytosis should be suspected in anyone on neuroleptic treatment who develops fever, malaise or objective evidence of an infection and in neutropenic patients the adequate treatment should be started immediately.","2872":"The course of a mental disease is influenced by a multitude of social factors modifying the necessity and efficiency of treatment via drugs, e.g. neuroleptics. The influence of overriding social factors on the course of a disease is demonstrated, employing schizophrenic diseases as an example: Unemployment increases the admission rate of schizophrenics; schizophrenias take a more favourable course in developing countries than in industrialised countries; in the latter category, rural districts are more favourable than the urban regions with major cities. In acute schizophrenia, the healing process is promoted by a clear-cut and well structurised therapeutic environment in the hospital, whereas a loosely knit and permissive environment delays the curative process. Social factors are particularly important in prophylactic neuroleptic long-term treatment designed to prevent relapses; in this connection, special attention is drawn to the importance of emotionalism governing the attitude and behaviour of family members. These social factors influencing the course of the disease make it necessary to supplement drug treatment by suitable measures in the fields of psychotherapy and sociotherapy.","2873":"Psychiatric illness course is not characterized by total regularity. More often there is marked individual variability. This is an obstacle to making a valid prognosis and applying broadly based indication rules. Still today predictors of illness course as well as indication criteria for treatment are little elaborate and often faile in the individual case. The most reliable instrument for planning and assessing psychiatric treatment is the treatment course itself. The therapist as a participating observer can more easily check tendencies of illness course and adapt therapeutic strategies. Characteristics of treatment course in guiding further treatment are examplified by means of neuroleptic treatment in the acute and maintenance phase of schizophrenic psychoses.","2874":"Videorecording of diagnostic interviews is reviewed with respect to its effects upon patient behaviour. If this behaviour is to be a model of the behaviour outside the diagnostic situation, videorecording should not essentially alter behaviour. It can be derived from psychological findings that due to the patient's necessary consent to videorecording, but also by the recording situation itself, patient behaviour is modified. The advantage of audiovision compared to audiorecording to reach a more objective judgement is limited by the very few possibilities of evaluation of nonverbal behaviour. Empirical studies comparing the relative effects of video- and audiorecording have shown that videorecording has more disturbing effects on patients. If these disturbances do have differential effects at certain problems and personality structures of patients using the artifacts of videorecording should be a possibility for the efficient employment of videorecording diagnostic interviews.","2875":"Scientific research in psychiatric county-hospitals could substantially contribute to the further development of the psychosocial practice. Although the hospitals in principle are open to scientific activities, a genuin integration of research into these institutiones has not yet come about. The study then goes on to discuss perspectives for research, methodological issues and advances organizational proposals regarding the overcoming of these obstacles.","2876":"The age of onset of a first episode of unipolar depression was investigated in a community sample. The question we wanted to answer was whether the age at which people develop their first episode of unipolar depression is randomly distributed over the adult age span. Our results show that between the age of 15 years of age and 30 years of age most unipolar depressions have their first onset. Beyond the age of 40 only a few episodes start. A life table analysis demonstrates that across the life span most depressive failures appear early in adult life. These findings are discussed in the framework of the few earlier studies about the onset and course of depressive psychosis.","2877":"Studies concerning the distribution of psychiatric diseases within a defined population are of fundamental importance for clinical psychiatry, public health projects and the development of strategies for mental health care. Each of the 1.337 inhabitants of an Alpine valley was psychiatrically recorded within a seven years period. The outcome of the presented field study carried out in a rural Tyrolean region reflects the real psychiatric morbidity. The primary and secondary data collecting indicated relevant psychopathological symptoms in 22,8 percent of the population of this small Alpine area. The given data are terms of reference for the planning of mental health care, and more than that, allow conclusions concerning causes, triggers, courses and consequences of psychiatric diseases.","2878":"The frequency of residential placements in homes and households contrasts with the scarcity of its evaluation with respect to therapeutical effects. In order to facilitate evaluative studies, relevant structural elements and suggestions for a typology are discussed as well as methodological problems. Examples of empirical studies and their results are presented.","2879":"In recent years self-help-groups have grown in importance. The reason is an increasing gap between the needs of the population and the services, the medical system can supply. The patients themselves have started to take over the initiative to deal with the psychosocial aspects in connection with their illness. They no longer want to be passive objects but rather subjects, who take responsibility for their own well-being. After the creation of AA many other self-help-groups have been set up, which concern themselves with very diverse illnesses and emotional and social problems. In the above paper the group setting variables and the concept of the therapeutic work of self-help-groups are being presented. Also the model of \"Gesamttreffen\" is introduced, where several members of different self-help-groups join monthly to share view-points and experience. These \"Gesamttreffen\" can be accompanied by a professional from the medical or psychological field, whose help is offered if so needed.","2880":"Discussions with relatives of patients whose patterns of signs and symptoms, case histories and fate can be considered as quite typical of the area to be looked after by psychiatric teams in Italian rural districts, show that the strictly outpatient psychiatric care approach practised by Italian psychiatrists according to the new regulations can work successfully wherever psychiatric teamworkers do more than just their duty. As a matter of fact, the so-called \"reform law 180\" is very vaguely worded when describing the tasks, responsibilities and competences of the medical and administrative personnel. The interviews of the author with the person concerned also showed clearly that psychiatric reform \"alla italiana\" need not result in chaos, although such chaos reigns supreme in Italy almost everywhere where psychiatric reform had been imposed by decree \"from above\" without any genuine readiness on the part of employees and coworkers of the institutions and without an appropriate cognitive and emotional process of learning which would have been absolutely necessary before translating the new approach into reality. We must say, however, that the chaotic conditions encountered here and there are not representative of Italian psychiatry as a whole; at the same time, the conditions seen by the author in the Casentino district are also definitely not representative of the conditions in Italy in general.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2881":"The following contribution considers whether family dynamics can offer a profitable approach in a psychiatric ward for acute schizophrenics. Basing these considerations on a family-oriented origin of the schizophrenic disturbance, the relationships between family, patient, and clinic are outlined within the framework of a psychiatric crisis situation. Subsequently, practically relevant problems are discussed: Which therapeutic attitude should be adopted towards family members of our patients? Which specific tasks arise in the early stages of in-patient treatment? In conclusion, the author shows by means of a case report in which manner a supporting type of family-oriented work can be a meaningful complement to other therapeutic measures performed by the ward physician and medical staff.","2882":"A review is presented of recently developed forms of therapeutic work with relatives of psychiatric patients. Using the dimensions of \"dominance of the expert\" and \"dominance of the relative\" a typology of work with relatives is presented, which besides different forms of group work encompasses also \"family therapy\" at the one end of the spectrum and \"self-help\" at the other end.","2883":"From the few publications available in literature it is evident that suicide risk in psychiatric patients is considerably higher after their discharge from hospital than during inpatient treatment. The present study covers 21 recorded suicides of patients in a hospital outpatient ward for preliminary care and aftercare of psychiatric diseases. This figure represents 0.8% of all treated patients and corresponds to a suicide rate of 600 per 100.000 treatment episodes. At the time of suicide, 13 of these patients were still in outpatient treatment and 3 in the clinic. The others had been transferred or had discontinued treatment. Almost two-thirds suffered from psychoses belonging to the schizophrenic disease pattern. Contrary to what has been reported in literature, most of the suicides (almost two-thirds) occurred more than twelve months after their last hospital discharge.","2884":"The author treated as inpatients or outpatients a total of 26 individuals with typical acarophobia syndrome, using neuroleptics, mainly Pimozid\/Orap. His results have shown that neuroleptics are drugs with rapid and pronounced action in acarophobia and that they have a syndrome-specific profile. The author presents the theoretical and practical consequences of his experiences in connection with this mode of treatment.","2885":"The concept of \"basic discorders\" facilitates the developement of more widely differentiated therapy models even for acute forms of schizophrenia. Psychopharmacological, psychotherapeutic and sociotherapeutic aspects are presented in light of a case report. This multidimensional strategy is based on catamnestic and epidemiological results of our own studies.","2886":"In recent years, depot neuroleptics have gained in importance in the outpatient treatment of chronic schizophrenics. These neuroleptics make drug therapy safer than before, thus improving the prerequisites for socio-therapeutic and rehabilitative measures. The present study analyses the ranking and value of this kind of treatment in the management of outpatients. A random sample of 80 schizophrenics treated as outpatients, by a psychiatric university clinic working on a sectorial basis was examined for the purpose of this study. Treatment results, problems of indication, limitations of therapeutic possibilities using depot neuroleptics, as well as constellative conditions under which therapy was discontinued, are discussed.","2887":"During the past decades much effort has been taken to encourage community - based treatment and service for mental patients, and to reduce the share of the large custodial institutions within mental health care systems. Both in the United States and in W-Germany (FRG) there has been a growing awareness that major inadequacies occur especially with providing community--based out-care for the seriously mentally ill. Much of these inadequacies refer to those released from the mental hospital with such needs as help to structure their everyday lives, adequate housing, nutrition, support for the families and neighborhoods involved, financial support, and further treatment. Part 1 delines the growing awareness of these problems with reference to the expectations of \"reformists\" both for the U.S. and the F.R.G. The paper then describes empirical data about the care given to patients released from the psychiatric hospital within a 90 days' period in the State of Hawaii, U.S.A. It also gives a structural description of agencies involved in the aftercare services, and relates this both to the empirical findings and reformists' views on aftercare needs.","2888":"The article describes the problems of Balint seminaries held internally in hospitals, basing on literature and on the authors' practical experience, with particular reference to the effectivity of Balint group work. On the one hand, it is evident that this entails a number of disadvantages compared with Balint groups not linked to the institution; however, these drawbacks are no fatal obstacle to Balint group work. On the other hand, we can safely reject the argument that it is not possible to topicalise within the framework of a Balint seminary the pathology of reference in psychiatric and particularly in schizophrenic patients.","2889":"Social control and social support are important aspects of psychiatric care. Modern psychiatric care in an area close to the residential quarters of patients requires attentive and self-critical observation, especially of the subtle forms of social control. The concepts of social control and social support are explained; basing on own investigations by the authors, as well as on own experiences and literature, some aspects of social support of schizophrenics and alcoholics are described from the viewpoint of local care.","2890":"100 patients of a surgical and internistic emergency ward of a general hospital were examined from the psychosomatic and psychiatric angle. 20 patients remained without surgical and internistic diagnosis; under this aspect, only 3% had no psychic principal sign. In 50%, psychic symptoms were seen. This leads the authors to demand inclusion of the psychosomatic-psychiatric discipline when rendering first aid, in the form of interdisciplinary co-operation.","2891":"With a case-history of a puerperic psychosis we describe the crisis-interventions-technique in six steps used in our 16-bed, socio-psychiatric ward in the city of Berne at a general hospital. Out of more than 5 years of work we illustrate one year with client-data, working-methods and statistical results. With such a ward in the community, embedded in a complete net of socio-psychiatric institutions, we can treat quite serious psychosocial crisis adequately and in relatively short time.","2892":"156 patients from two psychiatric hospitals were asked about their expectations and wishes regarding their further medical care and treatment immediately prior to their discharge. Answers were analyzed according to age, sex and diagnoses. This is contrasted by the suggestions of the medical staff, which seems to be influenced mainly by the diagnosis. Overall there is a high correlation between the suggestions of the doctors and the wishes of the patients. By comparing the answers for each individual case, however, it is shown that only about one half of the patients can accept the advice of their doctors. Major differences and difficulties are noticed specifically for schizophrenics, patients with psychoreactive crises and after attempted suicide. For the future it is desirable that, on one hand, the needs of the individual patient are investigated and considered more thoroughly by the attending doctor and, on the other hand, the medical suggestions are made clearer to the patient.","2893":"As a review of the literature concerning sexual side effects of psychotropic drugs in psychiatric patients reveals, sexual disturbances (such as erectile or orgasmic dysfunctions) seem to be a common consequence of psychopharmacological treatment. The frequency and relevance of these effects in psychiatric practice were estimated in a questionnaire study with 68 psychiatrists, working either in a practice or a clinic. According to the physicians answers, few patients report sexual side effects of drugs spontaneously, through these are supposed to be more common. Different kinds of sexual impairment are reported as specific effects of the drugs. As the physicians assume these effects generally provide a problem, both for the patients self-esteem as well as for treatment and compliance. Based on the psychiatrists experience patients are in a surprisingly good position to differentiate between the influences of their basic illness and a specific medication as far as sexual changes are concerned. One part of the questionnaire asked for the observed effects of specific psychotropic substances on sexual behaviour. The results support the evidence reported in the literature that neuroleptics and antidepressants are most likely to provoke sexual impairment. The results of the study are discussed in relation to the theoretical relevance of sexual side effects for the patient and the treatment and to the possibilities of a psychiatrist to prepare and inform his patient.","2894":"The concept of a rehabilitative gerontopsychiatry is presented by describing an example of a flat-sharing community for elderly people in contrast to the conventional kind of help afforded in old people's homes. The practical setup and realisation of residential communities for the elderly are described. The focal point of chiefly rehabilitative gerontopsychiatry is seen in the maximum possible preservation of abilities and capacities which can help to overcome the disabilities--which, of course, must be carefully diagnosed beforehand.","2895":"The effectiveness of day hospital care of geriatric psychiatric patients was evaluated in a pilot study. The main aspect was the training of social competence, i.e. a training leading to growing personal independence of the demands of every day life, such as hygiene , fitness considering the household, etc. During day hospital treatment a significant improvement regarding social competence was attained. A one year follow-up showed a moderate decline in the patients' performances of the earlier trained skills.","2896":"Following a brief discussion of the historical development of the term \"Organic Psychosis\", detailed consideration is given to the phenomenology and differential diagnosis of this group of diseases. The published epidemiological data is compared to the results of our own study. The cranial CT makes it possible to correlate clinical and morphological findings. In our investigation 72.5% of the patients with severe chronic organic psychosis show considerable brain atrophy. The morphological aspect is a determining factor for the therapeutic measures and for the prognosis.","2897":"Haloperidol decanoate injected every 4 weeks is a very important basic therapy for the treatment of chronic psychiatric patients. The results of this investigation compared to a long-term treatment with neuroleptic polytherapy showed a superior action of HDD monotherapy in chronic schizophrenia. The dosage schema can be adapted individually whenever necessary. Antiparkinson medication could be reduced and sometimes omitted.","2898":"The literature reporting on the readiness of persons at suicide risk to make use of helping agencies and to comply with therapeutic advice is reviewed including first results of an experimental investigation carried out by the authors and associates. Selection phenomena in the field of suicide prevention which have received little attention yet are demonstrated by means of data on the patients of different helping agencies. According to the results, medical practitioners are a primary resource of outstanding importance. There is also evidence for services like the Telefonseelsorge to be important factors in suicide prevention. Generally, the patients are more willing to follow therapeutic recommendations than so seek help spontaneously. In suicide attempters the utilization of recommended care can be considerably improved by increasing the motivation of patients, by intensifying the primary psychiatric intervention, and by avoiding a change of the therapist. The therapist's professional skill may also have an important influence on compliance and on drop-out rates.","2899":"Following the agreement on the splitting of the burden of cost to be borne by the Federal German national health and pension insurance schemes, the cost of treatment of addicts has been divided between the relevant bodies. This division of cost has developed into an obstacle especially to the development of curative treatment in community areas close to patients' domiciles. The article analyses the example of the Addicts Department of the Bremen-Ost Central Hospital to demonstrate the partly absurd and illogical sequelae of various cost allocation regulations for the motivation and treatment of addicts.","2900":"This article reports on the treatment of a young Moroccan woman in a psychiatric department located near the patient's domicile. This woman suffered under the mental stress imposed by an unwanted pregnancy leading to a severe mental and social conflict with the traditional cultural values and standards upheld by her family and troubling her conscience. The aetiology is discussed on the basis of the hypothesis that the conflict of loyalties of immigrants between traditional cultural standards and those of their present country of residence can develop into a cultural intrafamilial conflict in the minds of the younger, second generation. The article concludes with suggestions to achieve therapeutic orientation aids in the treatment of patients who have their roots in countries with an entirely different pattern of culture. Two suggestions are underlined: on the one hand, to enlist the help of a person from the same country of origin as the patient, who will be able to aid the therapist with relevant information; and, on the other hand, to include the family of the patient in the overall treatment concept.","2901":"Age extensively influences suicidal behaviour. Compared with younger persons, the elderly show higher suicide rates. Suicide attempts more often show characteristics of \"unsuccessful suicides\". Somewhat more frequent then in younger persons the suicide attempts are caused by depressive or schizophrenic psychosis. Nevertheless with the elderly the most frequent diagnoses are neurosis and depressive reaction. The elderly react depressive more often in relation to life events as conflicts with or loss of relatives or contracting a severe physical disease. Conclusions are drawn for a more adequate treatment of elderly suicidal patients with regard to their specific needs concerning psychological, physical and social problems. In many respects the G.P. seems to be the most suitable person for this task.","2902":"Suicidality is a frequent accompanying symptom in mental diseases. The prevention of suicide is considered as a task which must be a matter of course to a psychiatric hospital. However, it is an established fact that suicides by patients occur in all psychiatric institutions. In this manner, suicide by a patient is liable to be interpreted as a question of guilt to prove that the therapist has failed in his task. On the other hand, it is naturally impossible to advocate the prevention of suicide at any price. The psychiatric hospital is bound to respect the patients' dignity. At the same time, the question arises whether suicidality among psychiatric patients is merely an expression of a diseased state of mind or also an understandable reaction to the social problem arising out of the disease. It is imperative that the therapists face the suicidality of their patients fairly and squarely and that they should place less emphasis on restrictions suppressing the patient than on an active and positive influence exercised by therapy, so that suicide by a patient can be avoided not only in the hospital but also after the patient's discharge.","2903":"In 1980 the psychiatric clinic of the University of Hamburg took charge of a catchment area within the city of Hamburg. From this year on the clinic decided to provide half of its in-patient and day clinic capacity (that is 71 beds and 10 day clinic places) for a population of 139,000 living in this region. The effects of this decision are discussed on three levels: - changes in the patient population - opinions and attitudes of the clinic personnel - implications for the organizational structure The proportion of in-patients from the catchment area increased from 20% to 45% due to the clinic taking charge of this region. This increase did not much change the characteristics of the total in-patient population admitted to the clinic, except for a shift towards more older patients and more patients with a diagnosis of dementia or organic psychosis. Around two thirds of the clinic personnel held a predominantly positive view of the clinic's decision to establish a catchment area. Contrary to some hopes the internal structure of the clinic did not change much in response to its newly acquired responsibility for the catchment area. Nevertheless a period of one year seems too short for such changes to occur. ","2904":"6 investigators of a \"Psychiatric Emergency Service\" recorded 299 outpatient emergency cases which required immediate involuntary admission in accordance with a new Hamburg Civil Law. To identify the factors exercising an influence on the indication for involuntary admission, the 299 interventions were compared resulting in outpatient treatment (n = 93) vs. voluntary admission (n = 84) vs. involuntary admission (n = 122). It was shown that the factors \"diagnosis\", \"hazard\", and, in particular, the interaction between patient and emergency physician, mainly determine the indication. The interactions of these factors are differentiated in detail, with respect to age, sex, and social factors.","2905":null,"2906":"The present paper gives a description of a research project which tries to evaluate the significance of family support in reducing relapse rates in schizophrenic patients. Two different forms of support for relatives are compared, a discussion group and an approach furnishing a behavior training in addition. The report is supplemented by depicting some key conditions which should be taken into consideration when establishing a support system for relatives in a Mental State Hospital. This account is based on the data of 35 patients and 62 meetings with relatives collected during the pilot phase of the project.","2907":"The results of psychologic psychosis research point to elementary disturbances in the reception and processing of information. Such impairments are usually not noticeable during routine psychiatric interviews. Attention is drawn to a few reasons for this discrepancy between research results and diagnosis of individual cases. Examples are quoted to show that it is quite possible to obtain information from the patients under certain conditions, allowing the treating physician to detect latent disturbances which can help to supplement available research results. At the end of the article, the author discusses the ensuing consequences when dealing with such patients.","2908":"The reform efforts in the Federal Republic of Germany after the end of the war have led to a reformation of the regulations concerning legal responsibiltiy. The new law enumerates in articles 20 and 21 as prerequisites of irresponsibility or diminished responsibility for concepts: pathological psychic disturbance which comprises all psychic diseases like schizophrenia and manic-depressive states as well as psychic alterations resulting from brain damage. The second term is feeble-mindedness. The third one is profound disturbance of consciousness which refers to states of strong mental agitation not caused by an illness. Finally the new law used the concept of sever other mental abnormalities. Rather unfortunately the law has introduced the German expression \"Abartigkeit\" which has a derogatory tinge, insinuating the idea of degeneration. The adjudgment of irresponsibility or diminished responsibility does not depend on the type of psychiatric diagnosis. The new regulations offer the chance to psychiatry to take on more therapeutic responsibilities for mentally disturbed offenders.","2909":"The situation of the mentally diseased lawbreakers in West Germany is described on the basis of an inquiry among 70 clinics or sociotherapeutic institutions. This study shows that the situation of the forensic stations or departments--with the exception of a few model institutions--is absolutely inadequate, both from the viewpoints of construction and as far as staff is concerned. The sociotherapeutic institutions are usually treated and considered as models, and hence they are well equipped. However, the small number of facilities now available is nothing more than a drop in the bucket. Forensic psychiatry is unable to fulfill its legal tasks if it is understaffed and inadequately housed on the one hand, and if the forensically referred patients are not differentiated clearly and unequivocally on the other hand. In this respect, possibilities are discussed which might contribute to improving present conditions.","2910":"The Hamburg sexual counseling unit has been working since 1979 as a model project of the Federal Ministry of Youth, Family and Health. The therapeutic work done by the unit is based on the concept originally worked out by Master and Johnson, which was modified at the Department of Sex Research at Hamburg University in such a manner that it is both helpful and feasible as a treatment pattern for patients coming from all social classes. Basing on sexual symptoms, a problem definition is worked out which aims at underlining the subjective importance for the patient of the symptom concerned. The important factor is the ratio of stabilizing and destabilizing elements of a disturbance, in other words, the question as to the function of the sexual disturbance in the psychic or partnership balance either in the sense of rejecting desires for change or of reinforcing the \"healthy\" components of the symptom in the sense of prompting a motivation for change. In this regard, therapy is considered as one of many possibilities of effecting a change. Particularly successful has been the employment of couple therapy and group therapy for couples and for women.","2911":"We present the theoretical basis and results of a comprehensive research project concerning the psychotherapeutic treatment of sexual offenders in an ambulant setting. The therapeutic sample (n = 86) consists of patients with the following symptoms: exhibitionism, child molestation and sexual aggressive acts towards women. Data concerning the sexual deviant symptomatology, the general and sexual socialization and the actual psycho-social situation are demonstrated. The sexually deviant symptoms is considered in regard to basic personality deficits and general life-coping strategies of the patients. Concerning the therapeutic procedure and process we emphasize the importance of a concept focussing the individual patient and the psychodynamic function of his deviant symptom. The results at the end of therapy and at follow-up (average 2 1\/2 years) are presented. Finally we discuss a concept for the decentralized psychotherapeutic supply of these patients.","2912":"Splitting up of psychiatry into a forensic and a psychotherapeutic branch is unjustified as far as the scope of these branches is concerned, and entails a disadvantage at the expense of the delinquents, since nobody feels he is therapeutically responsible. Therapeutic aspects in expertising are worked out, and the specific difficulties and conflicts between forensic and therapeutic problems are demonstrated. Anyone who believes that therapeutic identity cannot be reconciled with legislation concerned with culpability, suffers from the prejudice induced by a \"blind spot\" in his mental eye.","2913":"A review of the literature published during the past ten years reveals a clear drop in the number of publications on the treatment of sexual deviations with antiandrogens. Although only one double-blind study has been published so far, we can safely say on the basis of the other experience reports that the antiandrogen Cyproterone acetate reduces appetence in males and also that this effect is reversible, besides an established good body tolerance of the preparation. At first, the spectrum of indications was very broad, and it is now markedly narrowed down, although it is still very inhomogeneous. The need of combining treatment with antiandrogens with psychotherapeutic measures has been generally recognized. Catamnestic reports are extremely rare. This means we are unable to give a satisfactory answer to essential questions, such as the range of indication, the duration of treatment with the preparation under discussion, the number of relapses after discontinuing the administration, etc. Further research in this field is imperative.","2914":"From a group of 1780 recruits, 30 recruits who had been showing behavioural disorders but had remained in army service, were compared with a control group of recruits who had never demonstrated any deviant behaviour. This was done in order to gain information of the performance of the examined persons in respect of their physical capacities, emotional patterns, learning abilities and efficiency, consumption patterns, personal contacts and sociological integration. The article describes the methodic approach and discusses the results. In conclusion, the possibility of prophylactic sociomedical activity in the school of recruits is brought up for discussion, was well as the question of their fitness for active military service.","2915":"This article reflects on psychotherapeutic and sociotherapeutic components contained in clinical psychiatric work, seen under the aspect of coping with resistance and hostility experienced by the psychiatrist during his work both from his environment and his patients. Any self-aggrandisement on the part of the therapist, if he begins to identify himself with the image of the Good Samaritan, is nothing but a counter-reaction to the reaction of the environment, and any such counter-reaction must necessarily and finally result in an anti-therapeutic effect. The article discusses the necessary mixture of being distant on the one hand, and closely sympathetic on the other; of being either part of the patient's own madness and\/or remaining aloof from it; of finding a synthesis between the psychiatrist's existence as a person and as a professional worker; and, last but not least, of avoiding one-sided favouring of \"nearness\" and of imagining that there is such a thing as \"ideal therapeutic communion\". In short, the author suggests that the psychiatrist should not behave like an actor on a stage who has been asked to play a part that has been cast for him. The idea of opposition to therapy requires an antithesis, namely, that of the \"Anti-Samaritan\".","2916":"Psychotherapeutic endeavors of individuals in the context of a graduated overall psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological strategy often fail to result in successful treatment because insufficient attention is paid to the biologically variable dimension of disturbed psychophysical integrity. The significance of intermediate pathogenetic stages in multistratified \"neurotic\" depressions and in anorexia nervosa and compulsive syndromes are dealt with in detail. Irrespective of the primary psychodynamics, neurobiologically modulated condition pictures with unusual autonomous dynamics can determine the picture. The same psychotherapy and somatotherapy does not entail the same action when carried out on a psychopathological substrate with different presentation and at different times. Finally, the possible transition from the psychosomatic clinical picture to \"compensated\" benzodiazepine-dependence is referred to. These secondary diseases exemplify iatrogenically modified psychopathological progress forms.","2917":"","2918":"The article attempts to describe dying as a clinically important phenomenon in gerontopsychiatry. This description is based on 1. statistical data collected in a department of gerontopsychiatry, 2. a summing-up of a few essential aspects of research on dying, and 3. several case reports. These three approaches lead to the result that the problem of dying is in many cases connected with phenomena which must be described in terms of gerontopsychiatry. The patients express the threat of death, which they experience as a loss of identity, by means of images based on highly individual personal experience. Hence, it is suggested that such psychotic images should be interpreted against the background of the individual's life history and not symbolically or psychoanalytically. From a sociological point of view, gerontopsychiatry seems to offer suitable means for eliminating the mental conflicts which assume a threatening aspect for most dying persons (a large proportion of them die in a general hospital, but this environment in itself does not offer sufficient relieving or calming factors; it is here where gerontopsychiatry must step in.","2919":"\"Therapy\" is a currency with two different notations, as far as court practice is concerned. If the offences are of a minor nature, such as exhibitionism, the judge will usually expect the expert to mention the word, which prompts him to refer the delinquent to a therapist without delay, even if he is not at all hopeful that therapy may be successful. \"Therapy\" is an inflationary currency. In severe cases, its notation is correspondingly lower. This development has been promoted by the increasing division between forensic and therapeutic perspectives in psychiatry. The difficulties resulting therefore are discussed, taking the example of expertise and therapy of a patient accused of attempted murder as basis. Suggestions are advanced in what manner this division between forensic and therapeutic psychiatry could be avoided or even reduced in future.","2920":"A treatment concept for sexual delinquents convicted and referred to psychiatric treatment in accordance with Section 63 of the German Penal Code, has been worked out at the Psychiatric Hospital in Weissenau. Among the manifold therapeutic measures, group therapy was found to be of paramount importance. The members of the group are described in detail according to their social characteristics, type of offence, psychiatric diagnoses, and major personality traits. Therapies derived from these basis conditions, with the corresponding therapeutic aims, are presented and discussed. At the conclusion of the article, catamnestic data are given of 18 sexual delinquents dismissed since 1978. 14 Patients were dismissed; 2 of these subsequently committed criminal offences, which, however, were not sexual offences; 2 patients each were transferred to another hospital or returned to prison.","2921":"First a number of aspects are mentioned that should be given special attention in the treatment of sex offenders. This is followed by a review of those treatment studies in which therapy was primarily either psychoanalytic or behavioral and which included a relatively large number of patients. Since the authors of the present study found that either a given treatment approach was indicated for a very limited group of patients only or the long-term outcome was poor, they developed an integrative approach for inpatient treatment of sex offenders. This approach includes behavior therapy, psychoanalytically oriented therapy and social therapy. The procedures are described briefly and the role of each is in the overall therapeutic concept pointed out.","2922":"Behaviour therapy is a successful form of treatment for many neurotic patients. The literature on treatment of paraphilias consists mainly of single case studies. The ideas of learning theory on which this treatment is based, have not changed in the last 10 years, but treatment goals are being considered much more carefully. Each patient needs an individual treatment program which usually consists of methods to change sexually deviant behaviour and strategies to reinforce or buildup usual heterosexual behaviour. Almost always deficiencies in social and communicative behaviour exist and have to be incorporated into the treatment as well. Although results seem to be favourable so far research on therapy outcome is of great necessity.","2923":"Recently developed psychoanalytic theories on the pathogenesis and psychodynamics of sexual perversions are described and their effects on treatment technique discussed. Then a proposal based on these theories its put forth for a comprehensive treatment plan for sex offenders, among person with sexual perversions an especially difficult group to treat. Special emphasis is placed on the problems and possibilities associated with such a psychoanalytically oriented approach, and the author then argues that during the initial phase of treatment two approaches, both psychoanalytically oriented therapy and behavior therapy, should be used parallel to each other.","2924":"The conditions determining statutory offences as represented by indictable sex offences, have been amended and revised by the 4th Penal Reform Law of the Federal German Penal Code, in 1973, under the heading \"Indictable Offences against Sexual Self-Determination\". This heading, which is meant to convey a programme, however, does not agree with the actual contents or core of various paragraphs. These new statutes have been violently criticised by opponents coming from quite different camps. The development of sexual delinquency shows a rather decreasing crime rate since the end of World War II, compared to the increase in other categories of crime. The most frequently recorded sexual offences concern the performance of sexual acts with children, rape and exhibitionism. It is in these groups of criminal offences that we are most likely to find delinquents in whom psychotherapy seems indicated. Criteria for indicating such treatment are the desire of the person in question to receive treatment, and the presence of a personality disturbance; it is not the deed by itself. The article then cites the paragraphs under German penal legislation which are important when arriving at a decision to refer a delinquent to psychotherapeutic treatment; these are Sections 56 c, 63, 64 German Penal Code, Section 10 Penal Code for Adolescents, and Section 9 of the Federal Law Enforcement Act.","2925":"","2926":"","2927":"The article reports on a ward with 12 beds which has been set up for emergency cases in psychiatry or for immediate intervention in case of a crisis experienced by a patient. In the theoretical part of this article, it is explained that crisis situations are present in most of the psychiatric emergency patients. The article then goes briefly into the fundamentals of therapeutic strategy in such patients: A therapy which helps to uncover hidden conflicts, the pros and cons of therapy focussed on conflict and on supportive measures; as well as a therapy which supports and promotes the ego. This is followed by a comparison of the ward with corresponding facilities in Germany and abroad and a description of their structure, their patients and their function within a psychiatric care system. The concluding part of the article is devoted to a description of the authors' initial experiences and impressions gained during their work with the ward patients, quoting several examples.","2928":"Using a reinforcement-oriented model of depression, we applied a multimodal approach of behavior therapy in clinical setting. We modified the self-control-group-therapy of psychoreactive depression, developed by Fuchs und Rehm (1977) in order to reach applicability for inpatients of psychiatric hospital. Operant techniques, social skills training, self-control-techniques, and the cognitive techniques developed by Beck (1979) were used. In contrast to Becks cognitive therapy we emphasized both the motivational aspect of depression and the aspect of self-regulation and self-modification too. There was not only the therapist trying to change behavior, thinking, and feeling of the patient by cognitive techniques. The patient himself tried to develop cognitive and behavior coping strategies. The treatment of patients with severe depression in an early stage was controlled by the therapist, later on they learned to control themselves. A central point of the concept of self-modification is teaching well founded knowledge of behavior analyses to the patient. Self-modification is not very efficient without, and the patient's motivation to work on his own therapy is elevated significantly. In some cases we continue this form of therapy after the patient's leaving the hospital up to three months.","2929":"","2930":"The authors present a setting for abrupt withdrawal treatment with the following targets: 1. To facilitate the addicts the voluntary use of medical and psychiatric service. 2. To develop methods for withdrawal treatment, as riskless and easy to handle as possible. 3. To use the time of inpatient treatment for building up confidence in psychiatric services to motivate the patients for a following therapy. Drugs and dosage of peroral and intravenous neuroleptic treatment and possible complications are discussed. Peroral treatment has the advantage of lower doses, easier handling and lower complication rates. The setting and the used drugs seem to be attractive enough for many addicts to contact the clinic on their own account.","2931":"","2932":"","2933":"According to the results of an inquiry in Niedersachsen, more than one quarter of patients in internal wards need at least a psychiatric co-treatment, most of them suffering from gerontopsychiatric and psychosomatic diseases and alcoholism. Internal specialists inform about this demand; the special treatment that ought to follow can mostly not be realized. The usual cooperation as well as psychiatric wards or hospitals mostly not within easy reach can hardly improve the situation. A special ward integrated in the general hospital is considered helpful for patients of this very house. As there will hardly be a chance of building up special new wards in the next few years, considering the present financial situation of the health care system, it is discussed, in which way an effective psychiatric-psychosomatic care might be created.","2934":null,"2935":"This article describes the role of psychiatric work with out-patients. It begins with a short thesis concerning the question: what is psychiatry, what is mental illness, what is therapy? In the main part the author describes the possibilities of extrahospital treatment for the user of psychiatric hospitalization. This article is based on the experience of work on the 13th arrondissement of Paris.","2936":"228 patients who had been admitted for the first time to a psychiatric hospital were questioned one year after their discharge in respect of the use they made of the medical and non-medical facilities or institutions. The article describes the actual state of affairs in the after-care behaviour of the psychiatric patients, and goes into details with regard to the diagnosis-specific differences in their behaviour. It is especially in this group of patients that a great demand exists with regard to treatment facilities. 90% of the patients have some kind of contact with our health system, and almost 3\/4 have undergone treatment for mental disturbances. The main burden of medical outpatient follow-up of psychiatric patients continues to rest with the family physicians. This is equally true for almost all groups of diagnosed diseases. The patients with schizophrenic psychoses represent the only difference, since they will tend to preferably look up a neurologist for the treatment of their mental complaints.","2937":"Six years of experience in the psychiatric and neurologic department of the General Hospital at Itzehoe (122 beds, including 78 psychiatric patients and 44 neurological patients; 5 assistant physicians, 1 psychologist, 2 senior physicians, 1 Medical Director [Head]; 38 nurses, 1 social worker, 2 occupational therapists) allow us to summarize initially the efficiency of such an institution: A department like this is basically able to take over full responsibility for the psychiatric care of a community district including the town and adjacent areas of other districts (totalling 120,000 inhabitants). The prerequisites--as is the case in the Steinburg district--are that a hospital is available for patients with chronic mental diseases; close cooperation with an established sociopsychiatric service; and, last but not least, a possibility of transferring patients for the purpose of long-term rehabilitation and withdrawal treatment in relevant institutions. Hence, it is absolutely out of place to label such work performed by \"small\" departments as \"gilded\" or \"miniature psychiatry\". Such departments are increasingly becoming the representatives of a type of psychiatry which definitely has a future because it operates near the patients' domiciles. However, it will be necessary to revise the job schedules, since the number of personnel employed in this type of work is by no means sufficient for conducting a type of psychiatry which is in line with modern concepts and requirements.","2938":"In January 1980 a Psychiatric Department was established at the General Hospital for decentralised psychiatric treatment of inpatients. The article describes the preparatory planning which went into the concept of the Department. First of all, the Hospital is scheduled to look after a district with a population of 110,000. If patients are in need of psychiatric inpatient treatment, they are not selected according to diagnostic or other criteria. In connection with the Federal German Government's \"Psychiatric Key Plan\" the hospital set up an outpatient department and--financed at its own cost and from own resources--a psychosocial contacting department, a temporary and permanent home, decentralised sociopsychiatric services located in the community itself, and other projects. The article then describes the treatment concept which includes, besides psychosomatic and sociopsychiatric elements, psychotherapeutic aspects as well, the latter having a point of emphasis in group therapy. Finally, the article underlines fundamental concepts regarding the problem of co-operation with a large psychiatric hospital. It is pointed out that it will be necessary to develop a comprehensive treatment concept so that it becomes possible to find out for each patient which type of treatment and care will be most appropriate in his particular case both as regards outpatient and hospital treatment.","2939":"Anyone who tries to convert a Psychiatric Department into a hospitable home for the benefit on the inmates and their environment, has quite often not reckoned with, the \"host\", that is to say, with the doctors, nurses and the hospital staff in general. Hence, it seems that a fundamental change in the attitude and consciousness of those who are engaged in psychiatry, is just as important as a new treatment concept or a new building. The author quotes the Bad Driburg Community Hospital as an example: here, planning and construction were not the only important factors. The nurses have taken and accepted advice with regard to their supervisory functions, and in the course of a protracted process they have changed their attitude in favour of a psychiatric practice which follows a treatment pattern based on a \"open-minded\" approach to community members.","2940":"","2941":"","2942":"The article reports on the first developmental stage of a psychiatric department in a location close to the place of residence of the majority of patients. This psychiatric clinic has at present 60 beds and facilities for 20 outpatients. The location of the clinic is in the area of a medium-sized town in a rural district classified as an area in which Public Health services are required to be active. First of all, the article gives a detailed description of the clinic itself and of the population and district it has to look after. Secondly, the article describes the present state and development of negotiations regarding the setting-up of an outpatient treatment ward. In this connection, it became unavoidable to point out the discrepancies between the need of the population to receive adequate psychiatric outpatient treatment on the one hand, and the policy followed by the relevant authorities on the other, the latter being unfortunately coloured by vested interests, both politically and by the class-consciousness of representatives of certain trade guilds and corporations. This is followed by a statistical evaluation of the patients treated on an inpatient, outpatient and consultant basis, together with an attempt to give a brief outline of the relevant epidemiology. Since the Social Psychiatric Service of Emden has close associations with the clinic--a fact which is rather untypical--the authors included a report on the starting-up phase and activity characteristics of that service.","2943":"","2944":"About 34 p.c. of the patients coming from Mannheim or outskirts treated in the child and adolescent psychiatric clinic situated in the centre of Mannheim attended a kindergarten, a public school or being at work outside the clinic while in part-time in-patient treatment or before release. These patients scored somewhat but not significantly higher on intelligence tests, had better school attainment and consisted of a relatively higher proportion of females compared with patients who were not involved in activities outside the clinic. Diagnostically a somewhat greater number of psychosis, neurotic\/emotional disorders were found among the part-time group and they showed also more associations with abnormal familial background, a higher proportion of part-time patients were not discharged to their families and have been treated for a longer time respectively. Not related to the length of treatment a significantly more positive successful treatment could be demonstrated among the part-time group. Particular aspects of a more realistic approach of treatment are discussed.","2945":"The report is about a model of psychotherapeutic and sociotherapeutic treatment of schizophrenic patients. Questions concerning the indication of different psychotherapeutic and sociotherapeutic interventions related to different schizophrenic states are discussed as well as problems of the integration of these interventions. Besides, aspects of the combined treatment of neurotics and psychotic patients are outlined.","2946":null,"2947":"Structure and functioning of a group therapy comprising all patients of a psychiatric ward is described in terms of psychoanalytic and group dynamics, behaviour therapy and cognitive psychology. 34 acutely-ill patients with heterogenic diagnoses reported their experiences with this group technique at day of discharge. Aims of therapy are discussed in respect of desired effects and risks for delusional patients. This psychotherapeutic procedure with inpatients is conceived as part of \"psychiatric psychotherapy\".","2948":"This article deals with the following three problems: 1. Which aspects must be given special consideration in respect of psychological diagnosis and therapy planning in those patients who have been referred to psychiatric treatment mainly because of violence displayed by them? 2. What are the conclusions we can draw from our knowledge of the behaviour of persons whose everyday behaviour patterns seem absolutely normal or even characterized by an inhibition of their aggressive tendencies, and who suddenly and unpredictably perform acts of aggression, and what are the conclusions we can draw from our experience in respect of the therapeutic management of such patients? 3. What is our knowledge regarding the actual course of aggressions and violence between patients and therapeutic personnel in everyday psychiatric ward practice, and what are the conclusions regarding a possible improvement of such interactions by appropriate therapy?","2949":"The article describes and discusses the possibilities of treating various groups of alcohol addicts. Particular attention is drawn to the underprivileged situation of chronic alcoholics. Suggestions for initiating a possible meaningful therapy are advanced. Another point of emphasis is the description of the possibility of treating alcoholics who have been compulsorily referred to hospital but who are not depraved. It is suggested to pay greater attention to the possibilities of short-term treatment and training to achieve controlled drinking.","2950":"","2951":"The current state of mental health care in Israel is described, considering the historical and sociodemographic background. Predominating are community out-patient clinics and cooperation of out-patient and in-patient services, whereas the number of beds and the size of wards is comparatively small. The country is consequently divided into catchment areas with a flexible adjustment according to the geographical characteristics and practical means. Generally the centres are richly staffed instead of expensive buildings. In a short amount of time and by comparatively small means, a modern and humane psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care has been established, fairly meeting the needs of the patient concerned.","2952":"Inpatient and post-inpatient psychiatric\/psychotherapeutic treatment of suicides poses a considerable number of problems which have to be handled by the institutions concerned: These problems are formidable because of the high incidence of attempted suicides and the considerable amount of work necessarily involved in caring for such persons. Care should by no means be restricted to the acute crisis; attempts should also be directed by preventing relapses and at improving the overall psychopathological status and social readjustment. The present manner in which suicides are looked after has quite a number of drawbacks, e.g. insufficient attention is paid to the requirements of the inpatient; patients fail to refer to the hospital during the period of their post-suicide attempt care; the incidence of \"dropouts\" during outpatient aftercare is very high; there is insufficient cooperation between the persons and institutions involved in the care programme. Improvements are presented which have been successfully tried out in practice.","2953":"At the admittance of patients to a psychiatric clinic, the diagnostic judgement of physicians with different functions was investigated. There was a great variability of statements on the severity, the consequences of the disease, and the social behaviour of the patients, dependent on the functions of the respective physicians who always tended to observe and judge first of all those sides of the disease that concerned their special fields of responsibility.","2954":"This is a report on the case history of a 66-year old female patient whose chronic involutional melancholia was disguised by the signs of a slowly growing clival meningioma with consecutive occlusional hydrocephalus. Despite repeated stays in hospital the deteriorating mental findings were wrongly diagnosed as an organic psychosyndrome of vascular origin until shortly before her death. Typical difficulties in differential diagnosis of the organic psychosyndrome in aged patients are discussed on the basis on the course taken by the disease in this particular case. This case also shows the fundamental possibility of neurosurgical treatment of cerebro-organic disturbances conditioned by disturbances of CSF circulation.","2955":"Follow-up studies were conducted in 21 patients 1-2 years after their dismissal from the psychiatric hospital. All of them had been advised to give up their won residential and lodging and in-patient care. All of them had rejected this suggestion. 3 only out of the 21 patients had since entered a home, 3 retained their own flat but had meanwhile re-entered the psychiatric hospital, 3 had since died flat, 3 of them without any outside help; all others required various forms of aid and support.","2956":"About 10 years ago reorganization of communal welfare services was initiated in the Federal Republic of Germany by the creation of so-called social stations. The method of working of these social stations incorporates important close proximity to the domicile or residence of the patients treated there. Hence, it is possible to make use of existing facilities without much extra effort in respect of organization, in order to translate some of the requirements of psychiatric care into reality. Since these services of these \"social stations\" are mainly utilized by elderly persons, these stations can take care of certain tasks of geropsychiatry. Social stations can also make important contributions towards early recognition and early treatment; they could strengthen outpatient care; they could prevent erroneous transfers to hospitals and could initiate neighbourship and lay help. On the whole, social stations should became more integrated into the local psychosocial care network to improve co-operative with other services.","2957":"In a retrospective study the author reports on the results of the first four years in the geropsychiatric day clinic of the general hospital \"Ochsenzoll\" in Hamburg. After a survey of the literature on the history and indication of day-clinic therapy for aged people, the author describes that in a chiefly psychotherapeutic and sociotherapeutic setting patients are treated who had formerly belonged to the category of inpatients, as well as patients without previous psychiatric experience. The main tasks to be performed in a day-clinic attached to a large hospital, are rehabilitation and prevention. These tasks cover different groups of patients which are characterized in the article. Pointers to factors which make it difficult to transfer some patients to day care results from the consideration which must be given to yet another group of patients who, although they participated in the therapeutic programme, could eventually not be transferred to the day hospital. A separate section deals with patients having psychogenic and organic disturbances, and experiences are communicated from day-clinic practice while referring to data taken from literature. It is finally underlined that the value of day-clinic therapy cannot be assessed in terms of money or economy.","2958":"An initial inquiry among patient of mental hospitals on their participation in the Land Parliament elections in Hesse in 1978 revealed an extremely low quota (7.5% only). Hence, before the Federal Parliament elections were held in 1980, the staff and patients of the mental hospitals in Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate had been informed in detail on the patients' right to vote and on possible difficulties in translating this right into reality. A bare one-fifth of the patients did actually vote as a result of this information campaign. This is partly due to the fact that the mental patients themselves have rather hazy notions about their rights - and this applies equally to the staff and to the civic authorities, Several practical difficulties which stand in the way of the patients in exercising their civil rights, came to light on this occasion.","2959":"","2960":"Conversion symptoms involving conspicous pseudoneurological signs of the motor system are very seldom today. To differentiate in these cases between organic and functional disturbances is highly difficult. Two patients are described. A 25 year old soldier with the symptomatology of a repetitive transverse lesion of the spinal cord and a 70 year old pensioner with a blepharospasm. They both showed an accompanying depression. Diagnostic criteria, psychodynamic models and especially the organic background of conversion symptoms are discussed.","2961":"","2962":"","2963":"All Patients residing within the area looked after by the Psychiatric Clinic of the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover (Hannover Medical University) who had been initially hospitalized with schizophrenic psychosis (ICD 295) and discharged between 1.1 1973 to 31.12.1978, were followed up until 31.12.1979. Men were rehospitalized significantly earlier and more often than women. This difference between the sexes were independent of age, diagnostic sub-category, school education, professional activities at the time of first hospitalization, marital status and - with men - of the duration of the first period of inpatient treatment. The following points are discussed careers of schizophrenics: sex-determined course of the disease; aspects of the behavioural attitude of the patients in relation to their disease, role obligations and reactions on the part of the social environment; and influences exercised by the medical care system.","2964":"The article reports on a study of 22 suicides which occurred between 1972 and 1978 during inpatient treatment of patients of the Psychiatric Clinic of Hanover Medical College, partly within the premises of the clinic and partly without. The group of patients who committed suicide in the clinic itself is characterised on the basis of the individual social, personal and disease-relevant data and compared with the overall patient population of the clinic. It is found that there was an increase in the suicidal rate following a change in the organisational and therapeutical skeleton concept of the clinic, but the question whether there is a causal relationship must remain unsettled. It is also discussed whether a higher proportion of suicidal risk patients is being admitted to the clinic due to greater emphasis on the care for residents in nearby areas, patients who would otherwise not have been treated on an inpatient basis. Another problem which is considered worth discussing is whether and to what extent rehabilitation activities overtax the facilities and possibilities of some hospitals and to what extent the new - basically favourably rated - clinical concept for suicide-risk patients entails additional burdens which could be met by suitable suicide-preventive measures.","2965":"","2966":"The legal and forensic aspects of suicide are explained with particular reference to penal and civil code and social welfare legislation. This includes inter alia suicide as a result of injuries sustained during an accident a well as mental diseases of various etiology and pathogenesis, all of which are given detailed attention.

A description is given of the problems the therapeutic team had in adapting to this new method. --After a \"consolidation phase\" of approximately a year, structured interviews referring to the above-mentioned new system were carried out with fifty patients over a six month period. These interviews showed that the patients tended to have reservations about the group rounds, and the majority of them showed a preference for the individual attention they were familiar with. The results are being discussed.","2970":"Joint admission of mothers with puerperal psychoses and their babies to the psychiatric hospital has proved successful. This not only avoids possible damage to the child and to the mother-child relationship as a result of prolonged separation; it appears that in fact the mother herself recovers more rapidly and is more self-assured in managing the child after her discharge from hospital. This, in turn, reduces the danger of a relapse and helps to stabilize the mother-child relationship. Joint admission of mother and infant is advisable whenever the neurotic signs shown by the mother centre around the relation to her baby. Joint admission is usually technically easy, while making exacting demands on the nursing staff. It requires detailed planning and organisation coupled with continual and close supervision. Under these conditions, joint hospitalisation of mother and child represents a widening of our therapeutic possibilities.","2971":"Ways to come to an indication for Client-centered Therapy are described. Client-centered Therapy is defined as a psychotherapeutic method. The present state of empirical knowledge is summarized and discussed including aspects of differential indication for psychotherapy. The article includes some comments about the interaction of the problem of psychotherapy-indication and the social status of psychologists within the traditional medical health system of the Federal Republic of Germany.","2972":"With reference to a case study, the author describes the possibility of combined analytic psychotherapy and directive and social measures. At the same time, it is shown that in the case of serious neuroses with various secondary social-impediments, the lasting success of a treatment can only be guaranteed if there is an approximately simultaneous change in the inner psychic state and the external social reality. This is achieved by a treatment setting which combines elements of a psychoanalytic psychotherapy with supportive and directive treatment techniques. The course of the treatment if discussed from both psychoanalytic and sociopsychiatric viewpoints; particular attention is paid to the interdependent conditions of inner and external reality.","2973":"This is a report about a 54 year old woman, who was treated with lithium carbonate because of a manic-depressive illness. As side-effect of this medicament she developed a relapsing hidradenitits suppurativa. After interruption of this therapy the illness of the skin improved, but relapsed, when the therapy with lithium was started again. In this case report we give a survey about side-effects of lithium concerning the skin.","2974":"Exemplifying an occurrence within an every day's situation of a clinic makes obvious, how conflicts between claims of treatment and therapeutic reality can be present and painfully discussed. This can appear within that space of tension which is immanent to a institution of that kind. Emphasis is laid on the importance of institutional Counseling for the solving of these problems.","2975":"Certain institutional and organizational prerequisites are fundamental in present-day translation into reality of essential concepts of psychiatric therapy and rehabilitation. These include, for example, the basic structure of therapeutic co-operation and the form of such co-operation as practices by a multiprofessional team. The creation and shaping of facilities based on the principle of mutual therapeutic co-operation and joint working of team members engaged in therapy, are innovations and are representative of a development by which a specific style in psychiatry gradually takes shape and by which it becomes adequately conscious of its social tasks. As with all innovatory developments there is an inherent danger that individual elements of such innovations assume of life of their own and undergo mystification. The concept \"team\" in psychiatry form of co-operation can solve many more problems than it can cope with. Hence it is definitely useful to investigate critically into the structure of teamwork in psychiatry, into its possibilities and prerequisites and into the extent to which teams are superior to conventional forms of organization in meeting the specific demands made by treating the mentally diseased. It becomes evident that among the basic conditions of teamwork are significant attitudes to therapy and that the therapeutic approaches derived therefrom can be successful only on teamwork basis. At the same time, however, limitations become apparent beyond which teamwork - now no longer understood as a problem-related principle of co-operation, but as an ideology - threatens to become dysfunctional and anti-therapeutic, creating compulsions which are diametrically opposed to the very essence of therapy and also to the needs of the therapist group.","2976":"50 trampers in India and Sri Lanka were studied in a semistructured interview by a questionnaire for socio-demographic data, for their medical and psychiatric history and their drug-experience. The MPI (Eysenck) and SSS (Zuckermann) were applied as tests for describing personality. Most of the trampers are around 25 years, stem from medium economical strata, have an education of high school or university. Nearly all of them are experienced drug-users (mainly hashish), most of them for long time without increase of intake and without bodily or mental or social deterioration. In the MPI the score for extraversion and neuroticism is within the (English) norm rage. Female probands showed a higher score of neuroticism than males. The total score in the SSS was significantly higher than in the standard population, mainly due to significantly elevated scores in the scale for disinhibition and boredom susceptibility.","2977":"It was the establishing of associations of parents and friends of mentally handicapped persons that started, above all in the 50's and 60's, in many countries direct and intensive endeavours for the improvement of their social situation. In this context the major goals are the normalisation of their living conditions and the realisation of the human rights due to them as well. Since that time the overall program drawn up by the National Society for the Mentally Handicapped LEBENSHILFE in 1959 set the standards for the work with mentally handicapped persons of all ages. The earliest possible beginning of longterm developmental training, including social training goals, underlies the social integration of mentally handicapped people. In adult life special aids and services must be offered in the fields of working, living and recreation. The participation of handicapped people themselves is a significant prerequisite for achieving an optimal degree of independence. In this context the role of the parents is of special importance as well. Trends towards bureaucratization and onesided professionalization in the work for the handicapped endanger all endeavours for integration. But the attitude of the society towards their handicapped citizens is decisive, too. Direct contact with handicapped persons can reduce prejudices and uncertainties, and open ways to their integration into society.","2978":"The article reports on experiences collected by the Psychosocial Working Team Darmstadt with its special form of organizations. Basing on a description of its origin, structure and development, problems of the concrete work done by the team are discussed which partly stem from its internal structure and partly from the status of such a team as a panel on a voluntary basis without being competent in respect of taking and implementing any decisions. There are specific limitations regarding the chances offered to a psychosocial working team in assisting in psychosocial care and welfare work on a regional level. It has been found particularly imperative to expect the team to continually reflect on its working methods and points of emphasis in order to cope with the continually changing pattern of facts governing regional care and welfare work.","2979":"First of all, the author underlines that the article is concerned with a specific of institutional advisory service, namely, the subconscious\/part played by the mutual co-operation of the members with each other and with the clients of an institution. He classifies his statements into three sectors: first of all, in comments on group analysis; secondly, in comments on the \"induced phenomenon of spontaneity in the group\"; and, \"thirdly, in a description of the intrapsychic, interpersonal and institutionalized forms of defence. One of his theses is: In the same manner as the individual is made up of many and partly contradictory aspects in his life and is nevertheless experienced as a unit, an institution can likewise be considered as a unit. This would also show clearly the great importance which must be attached to the participation of each individual member of an institution in one or several well-functioning working teams in order to fully mobilize the resources available in every institution. This leads us to consider the actions of the members of the institution as reflecting the behavior of the clients. Consequently, all opinions voiced by members of the institution must be taken seriously, even if they are not in line with conventional opinions, as reflections of the overall institutional body. We must conclude therefrom that our aim \"to help the mentally diseased patient\" can be achieved more successfully, with less frictionally conditioned loss of energy, the more we succeed in taking these various aspects seriously and in not suppressing them below the threshold of consciousness, and rather in understanding them as far as possible via a frank discussion of opposing viewpoints.","2980":"Based on personal experience, the new Italian law on psychiatric hospitals and its practical application is reported. The political aspect of \"new\" psychiatry is critically mentioned.","2981":"","2982":"In chronic addicts, the secondary handicaps usually dominate the disease pattern. There is a lack of therapeutic facilities which can be used specifically to tackle this problem. The authors introduce an institution which has been working since March 1974 with the consequent application of a Psychosocial Rehabilitation (PSR) concept in the treatment of chronic addicts. The method of working and the ranking of PSR are explained in detail. Efficiency control carried out within the framework of a dissertation for a diploma in psychology, confirms the efficiency of the PSR approach for the group of chronic addicts and points to further approaches towards therapeutic differentiation.","2983":"The article describes the initiation of a permanent treatment with methadone of 14 heroin addicts in whom despite long years of therapeutical efforts and care, chronic addiction had developed, leading to health and social breakdown and eventually to a breaking-off of the therapeutic contacts. A concept of polarization of therapy was evolved in order to implement the methadone treatment, according to which the therapeutic relationship was divided into a conflict-free sphere of methadone administration as basis of the therapeutic working agreement on the one hand, and a conflict-oriented sphere of psychotherapeutic discussion and further therapeutic efforts (ergotherapy, work therapy, social therapy) on the other. The experiences collected during the first 9 months of treatment are communicated, taking into consideration the special dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship.","2984":"The problem of an effective treatment of drug addicts is getting more and more important. This applies in particular to youngsters who have become addicted to opiate drugs. The medical profession is confronted by the question to what extent they can contribute towards tackling this task. It is becoming evident that success can be achieved if physicians join hands with skilled social workers. Insofar as drug-free methods are applied, the realization of such co-operation does not involve any obvious legal or ethical difficulties linked to a professional code. However, there is an obstacle to the development and critical testing of new methods in the field of addiction, namely, the scholastic tendency to recognize definite therapeutic methods only as being in line with professional ethics, whereas other methods, especially those supported by the use of pharmaceuticals, are rejected or discriminated right away as erroneous or illegal. It is suggested to gradually come away from this scholastic position and to utilize the criteria normally applicable and well-tried in the medico-scientific field. Differentiation between methods in line with professional ethics and questionable methods can be effected only against the background of empirical results.","2985":"This article focuses on the risks to which a physician is exposed under the provisions of the penal code if he is called upon to decide whether a patient should be admitted to the hospital or not. The conflict between the physician's obligation to protect the patient to be admitted, on the one hand, and to treat all inmates in accordance with the state of the art (\"lege artis\") and with humanitarian principles, on the other, necessarily leads to problems which are difficult to manage from the legal point of view. It is less likely that such problems can be solved by issuing strict regulations standardizing the procedure, than by improving the overall availability of medical care and treatment facilities.","2986":null,"2987":null,"2988":"On the basis of an investigation of 17 suicides and 13 attempted suicides which were committed between 1969 and 1979 in the psychiatric department of the Salzburg Mental Hospital, this paper discusses the question of suicide prevention. The emphasis of the present study lies on communication-theoretical considerations. We have found, among other things, that in an attempted suicide the patient unconsciously or (and) consciously manipulates his social context into communication-seeking behaviour (Zuwendungsverhalten), in a suicide, on the other hand, he manipulates it into communication-refusing behavior (Abwendungsverhalten). Although it is surely impossible to prevent all suicides, it must be possible to achieve a reduction of the suicide rate in psychiatric clinics. Concrete proposals to this end are put forward.","2989":"On the basis of the rules of the Hamburg Law on Aid and Protective Measures in Mental Diseases, a psychiatric emergency service operates at night and on weekends. This emergency service is called upon to decide on the need for compulsory hospitalization and to prevent the same, if possible, via therapeutic alternatives. The article illustrates by documents an initial phase of the activities of this public service. Within the framework of a preliminary study, 63 recorded incidents of service by four physicians are presented who collected data on the situation encountered by them at the time of examination, on the social and anamnestic background of the patients, on their psychiatric evaluation and on the indication for compulsory hospitalization or alternative treatment methods. 22% of the patients were subjected to compulsory hospitalization. Provisional hypotheses on the conditions under which compulsory hospitalization becomes more probable, are developed from the recorded data. The concept of the risk situation is specially reflected upon. The therapeutic possibilities in connection with institutional factors are discussed with a view to promote further development of crisis intervention in the sense of preventing compulsory hospitalization.","2990":"","2991":"This report shows a series of prognosis-data drawn from an examination of the social situation of all \"lifers\", who were released from prison in Lower Saxony between 1945 and 1973. The main point of the analysis is the high rate of over 90% of successful post-institutional legal behaviour. For most of the ex-convicts an increase in income and a higher job satisfaction (upward social mobility) were registered after release from prison; family integration is another explanation for the high rate of successful behaviour. On the other hand a long term of imprisonment destroys prisoners' ability to fit into society. The potentiality to social activity diminishes, family ties break down and the burden of the results of imprisonment -- a dangerous influence on the process of reintegration -- increases. Age and prison adjustment behaviour are mostly irrelevant as prognosis-criteria.","2992":"The conventional \"round\" during which the individual patient is seen by the physician and his assistants, has been replaced in many psychiatric hospitals by the so-called \"group round\". This is the result of the efforts made by therapists to reduce the distance and \"gradients\" between therapists and the patients they have to look after. In this respect, therefore, the \"group round\" is based on the principle of collective therapy, i.e. of the therapeutic community. The present article discusses the attitude and ideology forming part of the traditional round in hospitals. The form and organisation of the \"group round\" as practiced for the last decade in a sociopsychiatrically oriented University hospital are described. The article goes into details of the therapeutic value and advantages of this institutionalized interaction with the patient, basing on the author's experience, while pointing out the limitations of this method and the risks involved whenever it is employed without previous consideration of its aims and possibilities.","2993":"We report on the establishment and organization of a residential home, located in a small, fairly industrialized community without institutional background (nearest psychiatric treatment facilities more than 100 km away). Following a description of the structure of the populace, a report on the difficulties encountered in the attempt to integrate the inmates of the communal house into the local social frame, is provided. It is shown that a two year period was needed, before adequate communication between local population and home residents could be established and a satisfactory relationship realized. After a detailed account covering the rehabilitation methods employed, the special problems connected with legal and social re-integration are discussed (i.e.: transportation facilities to and from the communal home and the pace of employment). We conclude our review by a report on the results obtained and attempt to provide a number of suitable suggestions on possible improvements, for discussion and comment.","2994":"Living conditions have a major impact on the course of illness and treatment in psychiatric patients. Sheltered living and sheltered work are indispensable complements to therapy, if they meet the patients needs. A network of multiple and different facilities, as realized in the region of Zurich, seems best to answer the individual problems of the patients. Experiences regarding staff, the selection of patients, problems of dysfunctional developments and possible counterbalances are discussed. The latest trends regard close cooperation with patients' families, preference for small units and care for flexibility of institutions.","2995":"The article describes some of the prerequisites necessary for deciding whether a psychiatric patient can be returned to his family after inpatient treatment or whether further rehabilitation is preferably promoted via a transitional hostel. The (partly subconscious and not verbally expressed) conflicts, interests, desires and expectations of the persons involved are also discussed. In a regionalized care system developed on a sociopsychiatric basis, the dynamic aspects of solving a problem unfold within the triangle: Patient--Relatives--Therapeutic team. This network should be maintained even if the decision is in favour of a transitional hostel, and should be developed further particularly if the transitional function of the hostel is expected to produce a rehabilitative effect.","2996":"","2997":"The arguments in favour of caring for psychiatric patients in locations which are close to their domicile, are by no means new. Practically all of these arguments had already been brought forward by Griesinger, and we can also read them up in the minutes of the meetings of the Federal Germany Parliamentary Committee for Youth, Family and Health Problems. A frequent argument against the decentralisation of psychiatric care by setting up psychiatric departments in general hospitals is that this would eventually lead to a kind of two-class psychiatry. In simplified language, this would imply that those patients who are acutely diseased, are admitted to a general hospital, whereas the chronically diseased persons remain in the large-scale psychiatric Land hospital. However, this is not necessarily so, if such psychiatric departments of regional competence are compulsorily allocated to a certain area, which means they are compelled to admit patients residing in their area, while being prohibited from transferring these patients to another, far-away hospital. The departments in Rheydt and Hanover, for example, show that relevant experience collected outside Germany applies likewise to the Federal Republic. In fact, the reports published by these two hospitals show that psychiatry conducted close to the domicile of the patients improves outpatient follow-up of patients with chronic disturbances, whereas the number of compulsory admissions is dramatically reduced. On the other hand, the rate of admission is increased, and the period of hospitalisation reduced. In the long run, this results in a pattern of psychiatric care in which long-term outpatient therapy predominates. We can sum up by saving that community-centered and population oriented working is by no means a panacea for all problems of psychiatric care which have remained unsolved to data. However, experience has shown that the method is feasible and, on the whole a promising one. It is precisely the return of psychiatry to the communal level which opens up non-professional resources which would otherwise remain untapped. It must be borne in mind, however, that the physician's own psychiatric practice is exposed to the public eye to greater extent than before. This offers a real chance. The psychiatrist can take advantage of this chance only if he develops a kind of sixth sense for social processes and requirements within the community, for the best way to influence them, and to make use of them for translating one's own goals into reality. Of course, this will always involve the risk of overstepping one's own area of jurisdiction, but this need not be dramatised.","2998":"","2999":"This study was devoted to collecting information from 57 psychiatric hospitals in the Federal Republic of Germany with regard to the quality of the care afforded to chronic psychiatric patients. The study took place during 1977\/1978, and concerned the therapeutic and general quality of transitional hostels, homes for long-term follow-up care, and homes for the aged and multiple-handicapped patients. At the same time, the present-day effectivity of sociolegal rehabilitation aid measures was compared with the results of corresponding opinions polls conducted in 1973\/1974. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. \"Non-clinical\" mental health care of chronic psychiatric patients (mentally handicapped persons) requires specific pedagogico-therapeutic programmes specially adapted to the requirements of these patients. These requirements differ considerably from the conventional style of \"ward care\" which has developed in psychiatric hospitals. Regional fusion or co-operation of these homes is strongly recommended. 2. The effectivity of sociolegal rehabilitation aids for the mentally handicapped continues to be very low. This is partly due to the poor level of training and knowledge of the therapeutic personnel. Hence it is absolutely imperative to arrange for knowledge of this admittedly rather dry sociolegal subject matter, by means of suitable training and instruction.","3000":"\"Family Therapy\" should be preferably interpreted as a certain \"mode of thinking\" rather than as a specific \"technique\". It offers a framework which represents an aid to orientation, enabling the therapist to deduce instructions for appropriate action in almost all fields of psychiaric workaday routine or to deliberate on the \"sense\" of \"nonsense\" of therapeutic interventions. Sociopsychiatry which wishes to avoid the atrophy resulting from \"blind activism\", will have to adopt a line of thought represented by the \"family therapy approach\".","3001":"Care of geriatric patients is a significant, comprehensive and at the same time difficult task facing the psychiatric hospitals run by the Land government. In this field of psychiatry too, new approaches and concepts are beginning to materialise, which, however, are rendered even more difficult by many obstacles which have to be overcome. The present article reports from the practice of a Land hospital, and describes the new accents which have to be placed on diagnostic and therapeutic aspects as a result of the opening of a new ward for gerontopsychiatric patients, and explains how these new aspects influence prognosis. The article is based on the data of 200 patients whose treatment has been completed after this study was taken up. The purpose of this article is to provide a first critical reflection on the work done by the hospital and its staff, including the stimulation of discussions with other institutes and the outpatients field of activities.","3002":"The etiological relevance of occupational stressors has been estimated among 87 patients of a Crises-Intervention-Ward. This relevance was distinct in 23% of the patients and was predominant in further 7%--mostly in patients having attempted suicide. The relations of this finding to age, sex, diagnosis and occupational status have been tested. Among 22 single occupational stressors the following were the most frequent: low income, debts; unemployment; monotonous, boring work; non-attainment of the aspired qualification; massive pressure of a superior; too much responsibility.","3003":"","3004":null,"3005":"","3006":"The article reports on a catamnestic examination of patients of a crisis intervention center at a general hospital, conducted during the period from 1.5.1977 to 31.5.1978. A total of 560 admissions was recorded comprising 492 patients. Examination was carried out via an open questionnaire, plus data taken from the hospital's care index file. In 59% of the patients, the state of crisis was relieved in the course of an average hospitalisation period of 4.2 days; in 1.23% (= 6 patients), suicide occurred after hospitalisation. 2.4% only of the treated patients were re-admitted to inpatients treatment because of mental difficulties during the period of this study. Improvement of treatment is represented by the institution of facilities of transitional treatment which make it easier to transfer the patient from the crisis-intervention ward, motivating him to participate in long-term outpatient therapy.","3007":"The study shows the results obtained by introducing sport therapy into the rehabilitation phase in patients suffering from psychosis. It was found that the motor behaviour, the emotionality and social behaviour of the patients was significantly improved after a training phase of 14 weeks. Significant differences were also found in comparison to kinetotherapy and physiotherapy. The slightest amount of improvement was seen in the impulse behaviour. The article discusses the methodic consequences of these results in respect of sport therapy; the theoretical outlines of this method are explained.","3008":"Every patient is in a state of dependence in relation to his therapist, since the therapist's position is institutionally predetermined in his capacity as a person who assesses, evaluates, classifies and causes a kind of judgment on the patient's doings. If a therapist aims at encouraging his patient to become emancipated, he runs the risk of placing himself and his patient in a paradoxical position by demanding that his patient should be independent of him. This command could be obeyed by the patient only by not obeying it - and vice versa. This dilemma can be solved only if the therapist renounces part of his power and thus gives that patient enough free play for self-determination. Hence, the power of the therapist to achieve his original goal, namely, the emancipation of his patient, lies in his powerlessness.","3009":"This empirical article describes, first of all, the self-portrait given by neurotico-dyssocial adolescents hospitalized in the Youth Care Home \"Haus Sommerberg\" for therapeutico-paedagogic guidance. This self-portrait, determined by means of the so-called \"Giessen Test\" as a diagnostic tool, is characterized by psychosocial incompetence. After the youngsters had been treated for about 2 1\/2 to 3 years both psychotherapeutically and with the help of sociopaedagogic guidance effected at the \"Haus Sommerberg\" home, self-assessment by the adolescents was largely adapted to that of the corresponding comparative population group. In other words, treatment and guidance created a self-portrait of psychosocial competence. To test the stability of this induced change in the mental condition and ability to establish a social condition of reference, the treated persons were questioned once again 6 years after their treatment had ended. The results of this questioning showed that the changes persisted provided the duration of treatment was at least two years.","3010":"The increasing employment of graduates in psychology (Diplom-Psychologen) in psychiatric hospitals not only expands therapeutical facilities as a result of cooperation between psychologists and physicians; it also entails structural re-organisation both formally and in terms of contents, of behavioural rituals which have become routine practice within the entire hospital. The relationship between the physician and the psychologist decides on the success or failure of the activities of the psychologist in dealing with patients, nurses and institutions which are relevant for the hospital. The article reports on three years' experience in medico-psychological teamwork.","3011":"This study investigates the effects of a highly structurized therapy programme made up of different elements of psychotherapy and sociotherapy, conducted in 42 inpatients of a psychiatric hospital. Random testing of the patients was differentiated in respect of the diagnosis of a psychosis, neurosis and disturbed personality. Whereas clearly positive effects were seen in the group of neurotics (measured by means of the Freiburg Personality Inventory test before and after the therapy programme), this did not seem to apply to the group of psychotics. This group, too, included the majority of patients who discontinued participation in the programme.","3012":"The patient's relatives are rarely included in the treatment afforded to the patient in both psychiatric and psychotherapeutic and psychosomatic clinics. The family is in fact often regarded as a disturbing factor. So far, only few publications have devoted any attention to the importance of the family for the initiation and successful or unsuccessful course of inpatient treatment in neurotically and psychosomatically disturbed patients. The present article surveys the most important publications dealing with the interrelations between family and clinic before, during and after inpatient treatment. Furthermore, therapeutic techniques for including the relatives in the treatment process are described. These publications have mainly originated from contacts with psychotics and their families.","3013":"Following predominantly favourable earlier experiences with holiday trips, eleven long-term hospitalized patients of sociopsychiatric ward (an institution concerned with the gradual transition from psychiatric treatment to social rehabilitation) went on a one week's trip together with the ward personnel, emphasis being on the aspect of recreation. The patients themselves took over the organization of the daily schedules. Marked improvements in mood levels, a decrease in disturbances of well-being, and increased activity were clearly noticeable. These were probably due to relief from the clinic's daily routine and to the intensification of interactions within the patient group and with the therapists. Although these changes did not persist in most patients after their return, a positive effect for further therapy planning was seen in at least four of them. This experience report concludes with a suggestion to include such trips in the proposed treatment schedule for long-term patients.","3014":"A therapeutic dwelling community (TDC) which has been in existence for more than 3 years, is described in respect to its history of origin and development outside existing psychiatric institutions or facilities. After having been confronted with the unsatisfactory follow-up care of a group of relatively young, in most cases only medium-term hospitalized schizophrenic patients, the initiators of TDC developed a concept which was destined to strike a balance between care and activation of self-aid within the TDC in order to promote the mental stability and autonomy of the former patients. A description is given of the tension arising from the concept, between the claims on the part of the residents for care to be given to them on the one hand, and the expectations on the part of the guiding personnel with regard to the self-aid potential of the inhabitants, the description being given for different levels. The structure, dynamics and results of group activities within the TDC are also described. In this connection, an attempt is made to show up the individual and group-referred limits of self-regulation of the inhabitants and of the therapeutic interventions; overstepping these limits endangers individual management of the TDC. An attempt is made to derive conclusions on the basis of the collected experience, which may be of importance for similar projects in respect of structure, financial jurisdiction, admission criteria etc.","3015":"Report on the development of a temporary, topic-centered group with the parents of schizophrenic patients. Information on mental diseases was combined with group discussions and practised procedures (role playing, exercises in communication). The different elements of the group events are discussed (individuals, group, topic, leader-parents-relationship). The points of emphasis were: differences between more intellectually and more emotionally oriented participants. Need for communication which would relieve the patient of feelings of guilt. Strong cohesion of the participants. Counter-transference problems. Sponteneous continuation of the work in the form of a self-help group.","3016":"Despite the successes achieved by modern distraneurinomonotherapy, treatment of delirium tremens remains full of complications and high-risk problem. Basing on theoretical considerations regarding the delirium tremens as a form of psychosis, the additional application of a neuroleptic with an antipsychotic action is suggested to achieve a specific treatment, exercising a direct influence both on the psychotic and on the neurovegetative signs of alcoholic delirium. Experiences collected with a combination treatment extending over two years with haloperidol IV and ch clomethiazol oral, point to a decrease in the incidence rate of delirium, a milder course of the delirium itself, and a corresponding decrease in associated complications. This should stimulate further systematic and statistically safe investigations in this field.","3017":"Practical psychotherapy with psychotic patients is described in a new therapy model based on egopsychologic and neoanalytic concepts. Drug therapy, social therapy, psychotherapy, and group therapy with those patients are integrative parts of rehabilitation. The follow-up of a group of these patients is described, till half of them passed examinations and left the group.","3018":"Psychotherapy, beside kinesitherapy, pharmacotherapy and the use of appropriate devices in cardiology, are an important and integral part of therapeutic efforts in inpatient rehabilitation of cardiovascular diseases. A working pattern is suggested for the major part of psychological treatment, namely, group therapy, devised and translated into reality by a clinical psychologist for a specialised rehabilitation center. The therapeutical aims of group psychotherapy include adequate control of disease of anxiety after myocardial infarction and subsequent health training based on behaviour therapy. The different types of group therapies are described and assessed.","3019":"The author tries to convey an idea of the process which takes place during art therapy, quoting examples from her own work with mentally diseased patients. She considers the visual message resulting from the work of art created by the patient, as a process of communication which takes place between the patient and the therapist or between various patients, enabling an exchange of action with the environment--a kind of tentative or \"test\" behaviour--while catching up with suppressed or slowed-downed impulses by topicalising conflicts via imaging and tackling them by the process of creating art or an image. The resulting picture always conveys both diagnostic and therapeutic information. Visualization and shaping of internally perceived images strengthens the ego. Changes and limitations of art therapy are demonstrated by means of examples from individual and group therapy.","3020":"The article reports on Group Work making use of dancing improvisations and nonverbal interaction exercises as therapeutic media. The improvisation group is part of a stationary therapy programme for alcoholics. The therapeutic intention is to utilise the interactions of the group's members for therapeutic purposes. The improvisation suggestions and exercises should provoke nonverbal interactions which could then be discussed. The article describes the mode of action of the improvisation group on an individual member and on the whole group, the programme of this group, and the experiences made.","3021":"For each person working in the psychiatric field, disease concerns predominantly the individual. This statement is true for both somatotherapeutically and psychotherapeutically emphasized therapy procedure. The social reality of the patient himself is not taken into consideration in this procedure. A sociotherapeutical approach is attempted in this present study complementing the interpretation and action models mentioned above. Basing on a case of a female patient suffering from paranoid changes, specific intervention possibilities are explained, and also which meaningfully applied solution strategies can be successful. In this connection sociotherapy is shown to be a therapeutic procedure in its own right which, while actually trying to normalize the patient's psychopathological abnormalities, does not overlook his real life situation (which can easily happen with somatic and psychotherapeutic processes) and expressly makes this the basis and subject of the \"treatment\".","3022":"The present study is based on a complete institutional and personal coverage of psychosocial care institutions in nine local regions within the Federal Republic of Germany. The study was carried out by means of a short structured questionnaire and was supported by local psychosocial working groups. The following questions were considered on the basis of a sociodemographic differentiation, in urband and rural districts: 1. To what extent do differences appear between urban and rural districts with regard to outpatient-, inpatient- and complementary treatment facilities? 2. To what extent do differences appear in regard to the quantity and quality of specialized professional personel operating there? 3. In what way, and to what extent, compensatory care mechanism do exist? The results show important and systematic differences with regard to the outpatient, inpatient and complementary treatment facilities. Rural districts are characterised by an emphasis on inpatient facilities, including homes, as well as by a marked lack of outpatient facilties, especially of a psychotherapeutic nature. Psychosocial professions with high qualifications, especially in psychotherapeutic respect, are mainly found in regions characterised as urban, while they are nearly completely absent in rural districts. In addition the results point at a underprivileged treatment structure of rural district. However there are indications of compensatory care mechanisms. This means that persons without any specialized training are often engaged in treatment jobs requiring specialisation. This applies in particular to the complementary field of patient care. The article discusses overlapping problems of proper geographic distribution of psychosocial treatment facilities in accordance with actual requirements. Furthermore political conclusions resulting from this aiming at improvementsof the care structure for mentally ill persons are discussed.","3023":"The article reports on planning, organisation and realisation of measures for the continuing education of female and male nurses of the Westphalian Provincial (Psychiatric) Hospitals as laid down by the Continuing Education Commission of the Landschaftsverband Westfalen-LIppe (a semi-governmental organisation embracing many activities, including the care of psychiatric patients.) The article discusses in detail the teaching aim and the contents of the continuing education programme, the composition of the group of participants, and the mode of working practised in the training course which must be most closely related to actual practice.","3024":"The new activities of nurses working in the field of psychiatry, resulting from the realisation of sociopsychiatric and sociotherapeutic concepts, have led to an expansion of the \"job description\" of the nursing personnel. Intensive measures for additinal training and continuing education will have to be taken to acquaint this personnel with these new tasks. Such measures have already been initiated from 1969 onwards in various places within the Federal Republic of Germany. For the psychiatric hospitals looked after by the Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe, a continuing education commission which comprises co-workers of various job categories and institutions, developed a continuing education concept about which this article reports in detail with regard to target aims and tasks to be tackled.","3025":"The development of sociopsychiatric additional training (abbreviated SPZA in the German text) is closely connected with the development of the psychiatric hospital of the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover (MHH) from a level of psychiatric keeping aloof from everyday problems arising in a community, towards a type of medical care which remains close to community problems by paying attention to all the sectors that go into creating abnormal patterns in a community. The most important and still unsolved problems of the future are represented by the alternative of a jobspecific or comprehensive continuing education across the boundaries set by individual groups of professions (at present, SPZA is intended to look after several non-academic groups of professions) and  are also represented by the alternative of continuing education bound to one institution or on a regional basis comprising several institutions. It is the aim of  SPZA to create a therapeutically favourable environment and to establish therapeutic relationships in psychiatry, i.e. to reflect upon and to change the patterns of psychiatry, its attitude, and its institutions. The teaching aims are: Shaping of psychiatric institutions according to basic human requirements, in line with the continuing education concepts of the DGSP; furthermore, realization of the therapist's own share and the share of external sources in the therapeutic communicative process incorporating reflection of the pwn and externally conditioned socialisation; also, the acquisition of the technique of favourable communication, achieved by self-observation and reflection of the therapist's own patterns of behaviour in his capacity as a person dedicated to helping the patient. Another teaching aim is to head and guid therapeutic groups in accordance with the innate propensities and tendencies of the participants and the practical requirements of the institutions concerned. From the didactic point of view, self-experience, communication of theories, and the practising of the new patterns of behaviour desired by the participants themselves, are combined.","3026":"The author, agent of advanced training, reports--on the background of ten years organisationel development in a large psychiatric institution (Bethel)--his experiences under the special view of training therapists of all kind, mainly nonacademic personel. This all is done in many different and interdependent courses, a small department of a school within. The problems, in his view, are that education for all professions in Germany don't prepare really--in the sense of giving personal and pragmatic competence--for psychiatric work with the sick or handicapped and other professionels. So advanced training courses must help during people work in the institution. The author is confused but sure, that the best training evidently can't enable people in the central point--beeing encouraged to stay beside and with the sick people, if there is not growing a community of helpers together and with the patients. So education, studies and training are very important. But it seems that it doesn't work without sharing personal existance together, personel and sick.","3027":"The essay outlines the strained situation in which psychotherapeutic training in the Psychiatric Clinic nowadys takes place. First, the official training rules for the intending psychotherapist in the Psychiatric Clinic of the Medical School, Hannover, are described. By that, a series of general structural problems is delineated, which influence the organization of the training in psychotherapy within the broader frame of psychiatry and its different institutions, especially its integration into a hospital with a predominantly social-Psychiatric orientation: Admission of candidates according to the criterion of clinic membership (instead of personal qualification); limitation of the instruction period according to the time of clinic membership (at most three or four years); therefore early start of psychotherapeutic treatment with generally rather difficult, severely disturbed patients; treatment with modified psychoanalytic procedures, which in general presuppose an experience in psychoanalytic treatment of many years; self-experience usually in a psychoanalytic group, without own experience with a therapeutic face-to-face-relation and the therapeutic regression possible in this dyade; finally the strain--felt as a conflict by many candidates--between the pressure for action in the daily practice of social psychiatry, and the rather temporizing and permissive attitude of the psychotherapist, where the reflection of action is most important. The theoretical teaching of psychotherapy as well as supervision have to respond to these structurally defined conditions. The essay describes the hitherto existing experiences in the Psychiatric Clinic of the Medical School, Hannover, in Regard of the difficulties, but also the changes of the transfer of psychotherapeutic theories and methods to psychiatrists and--perhaps--physicians in general. It demonstrates, too, some possible attempts for practicably solving the specific problems of a psychotherapeutic traning which is not oriented toward maximum requirements, but toward realizibility withan an given social frame for the sake of patients who probably would not find treatment elsewhere.","3028":"The article reports on the setting-up of a continuing education programme related to practice, applicable in particular to nursing personnel of long-time wards in a large psychiatric hospital. The article describes the prerequisites of \"continuing education within the framework of the hospital itself\", organised in various sub-sections such as guidelines for group work with patients on the wards, and topic-centered continuing education groups for co-workers. The planning and execution of group work is demonstrated by means of model examples. The assumption that continuing education can help to change the atmosphere prevalent in wards and can also change the degree of activation of the patients, has been confirmed by the experience collected so far. This illuminates once again the need for practice-related continuing education an subject-specific further training for psychiatric nursing staff, even though in the long-term therapeutic field, possibilities of rehabilitation may probably gain more ground in psychiatric treatment of the future.","3029":"","3030":"","3031":"Several models for the integration of the work done by nurses and attendants into therapy are presented. In particular, the use of the \"Scale for Behavioral Observation in Wards\" is described. Important modes of behavior, which are relevant for therapy, can be trained for the benefit of nurses and attendants by observing the patients' behavioral patterns. The approach described in this article can improve the co-operation between the psychiatrist and nurses or helpers.","3032":"Within the framework of present-day strained relations between physicians, respectively their professional changes of making a career on the one hand, and society on the other, psychiatrists will be facing an even more critical controversy with their colleagues and psychologists. Looking to the demands made by these groups of physicians in respect of medical importance, psychiatrists are compelled to reconsider their own actions and professional pattern more thoroughly and purposefully than ever before.--A cursory glance at the increasingly obvious tasks of meaningful psych-iatry will immediately show that besides the very serious material problems in this underdeveloped branch of medicine, other and even more difficult tasks have to be tackled. One of the most serious problems, which is particularly delicate because it touches upon the psychiatrist's medical self-understanding, is the manner in which psychiatrists should conceive their own activities as a part of medical science and how they should arrive at mutually acceptable terms with their medical colleagues on the one hand and with psychologists on the other, the ultimate aim being to serve medical interests and not only the professional interests of the groups of physicians and allied specialists.","3033":"This article describes the reasons why pluriprofessional teams offer the ideal conditions for the therapy of psychotic states. Only they can reach the stability and the flexibility necessary to serve as a \"container\" for the fragmented ego of the patient in psychotic crises. But in this function, the team may fail. A new pathology arises, beyond the well-known \"institutional neurosis\". We call this pathology the \"combined institutional-psychotic syndrome\". Different forms of such syndromes are described. Last of all, we reflect on the consequences of these considerations for the conception of psychiatric institutions.","3034":"Basing on an intergative concept in which various aspects of learning and behavioral therapy, depth psychology and communication therapy overlap, the article surveys the possibilities and limitations (inherent risks) of playing \"divided parts\" in theatrical fashion as part of psychiatric training. A section on the basic technique describes how a play according to divided roles is built up in practice. From the viewpoint of a theory of playing divided roles, the functions, aims and a system of typology are discussed.","3035":"The difficulties of futurological statement about the role of psychotherapy in the medical care system are seen (1) in the problemacy to define the object, (2) to assess the present state of the situation of psychotherapeutic care, (3) to recognize the environmental conditions of the role of psychotherapy is paramount. The futurological hypotheses are centred on the supposition that psychotherapy is more and more tending not be fixed at medical professional roles.","3036":"Examination neuroses and learning difficulties in college students are almost always amenable to successful psychotherapeutic treatment. The total quota of examination neuroses among students should be about 3% to 4%. The article deals with the factors causing the neurosis, factors which made their appearance either during childhood or adolescence or during college studies only. The psychotherapeutic possibilities are discussed, special attention being paid to the active forms of psychotherapy and an analytically oriented form of group therapy. The good chances of success, which are between 90% and 95%, are underlined.","3037":"Following the boom in Group Therapy, the Federal Republic of Germany now experiences a similar boom in Family Thera;y. An attempt is made in the present article to show the stepwise progress from individual to group psychotherapy and finally to family therapy, and to describe and calssify the family therapy approach. The present family therapy boom is considered to be a kind of fashion. In the long run, however, family therapy as such will prove to be an important tool within the therapeutic spectrum. A cause for concern is the high demand made on the training and skill of family therapists. This deters those who had always considered family therapy as an integral part of their work in everyday paractice. This results in a plea for remaining close to actual practical conditions. The article close with recommendations for reading up relevant literature.","3038":"","3039":null,"3040":"One of the functions of a psychiatric hospital is the so-called private or guest-house function. Each methodical-therapeutic approach, eventually constitutes to the existence of a normal human residence. The anthropological structure of this residence, is characterised by a polar buffer between openess and privacy. In the \"Sociotherapeutic Centre\" at the psychiatric hospital \"Wolfheze\", stature is given to this private or guest-house function. The importance of the sociotherapeutic centre, lies in the living together of patients, with and for each other. The numerous hospitalizing neurotic effects, of long term nursing in big-pavilions, are minimised by the living together of patients in small groups. Hospitalization is primarily considered as a positive matter. The negative effects of the treatment fall under term \"hospitalizationsyndrome\". Living, hospitalization on one side and rehabilitation on the other are no contrast. The differences of these living-groups offer the best chances for socio-therapy and rehabilitation.","3041":"The legal measures covering protection and care in connection with legislation governing guardianship and fosterage involving medical nursing, which have remained unchanged in principle since 1896, increasingly create the risk of obstructing and hampering the treatment and rehabilitation of mental patients. In order to counteract this development, which is hostile to therapy, as can be demonstrated by means of concrete examples, a number of differentiated deliberations to improve the situation have been included in the expertise preparatory to the inquiry on the situation of psychiatry in the Federal Republic of Germany, dated 1975. These suggestions, which are well differentiated and aim at a minimum restriction of the rights of the individual in respect of protection of his personality, seem to be hardly sufficiently known, so that no use is made of them in public, political and expert discussions. Hence it appeared necessary to point once again to these suggestions as impressively as possible.","3042":"In cooperation with the University Clinic for Psychiatry, Innsbruck, the social psychiatric service of the regional government of South Tyrol set up a rehabilitation programm, under which 35 longterm hospitalized schizophrenic patients with an average stay in hospital of 12,9 years have been taken over by district institutions as outpatients. The object of our investigation was to study critically the working capability and the social relations of the 35 patients, the duration of postclinical catamneses is at least 3, at maximal 25 years. The degree of obtained reintegration is documented by the working situation and the number of social contacts. The obtained extent of resocialization and the proved positive social adaptation make it sensible to start a rehabilitation even with cronical patients with hospitalisation over decades: precondition is however a continual psychiatric care and control.","3043":"","3044":"Compulsory transfer of mental patients to closed hospital wards will continue to be a special burden on psychiatrists, social workers, relatives and legal courts. Attempts to establish close mutual therapeutic contacts must set in as early as ever possible.

Basing on a small sample of patients subjected to follow-ups, possible success criteria, such as employment and social relations, are discussed.","3048":"The article describes a ward for the admittance of female addicts in a provincial government mental hospital (Landeskrankenhaus). Addiction is interpreted as the sequel of a severe psychic disturbance (manifested as depression in most of the women) in conjunction with socially disturbed conditions (lack of social function, familial upsets). Possibilities of treatment in a provincial government hospital are limited. The essential therapeutic chance is offered by a firmly patterned ward structure and by creating an \"antidepressive environment\" which meets to a certain extent the patient's innate craving for security and her need \"to belong\", while at the same time promoting her own initiative and sense of responsibility.","3049":"The article reports on a behaviour therapy ward of the psychiatric hospital department, its origin, difficulties in the initial stages, and current mode of function. The transitory residential quarters and pertaining recreation centre are also described. In the Salzburg model, the behaviour therapy ward and the transitory residential quarters are a functional unit.","3050":"The article begins with a review of the geographically unfavourable distribution of psychiatric ward beds in Berlin. This unfavourable distribution hampers therapeutic efforts. The authors describe and examine the work done in the Psychiatric Outpatient hospital which forms part of a university clinic in the Steglitz district of Berlin. 1517 case records are subjected to statistical evaluation. The article concludes with the demand for a new plan for distributing the psychiatric ward beds according to a more reasonable key based on subsectors in line with the requirements of the different districts of the city of Berlin.","3051":"","3052":"The article defines the terms \"requirement\", \"need\" and \"need of treatment\", and explains their significance in the field of psychiatric care. The fundamentals of assessing the requirement are discussed, as well as the associated problems: recording and registration of patients in need of treatment, their readiness to undergo such treatment, and possible alternatives of hospitalisation. For establishing criteria required to determine the need treatment symptoms from two semi-standardised psychiatric interviews are examined for suitability (Present State Examination and Goldberg Interview); likewise, the severity of the disease, the stress from which the patient suffers, and the impairment of social relations, are also examined for suitability. It is suggested to take these criteria as basis and to operationalise the need of treatment on these lines. Relevant studies to assess the usefulness of these criteria are under way in two research projects of the Special Research Division 166 \"Psychiatric Epidemiology\".","3053":"The author agrees with Wing in defining sociotherapy as a deliberate reshaping of the environment aiming at reducing the signs of disease. This type of therapy has proved effective alongside the other two important kinds of therapy in psychiatry, namely, physical treatment and psychotherapy. Sociotherapy is explained by means of examples which can be classified as general sociotherapy and individual sociotherapy. Its application in the in-patient field is at present only possible if the female and male nurses accept it as a challenge and of the other members of team recognise and discuss it importance. Administrative bodies must be won over as partners in sociotherapy.","3054":"This article tries to describe the problems, difficulties and setbacks experienced by patients, doctors, psychologists or social workers when looking for a public health insurance body competent to bear the cost, as well as for a vacancy in a suitable hospital or institution where appropriate therapy can be effected. The case history of a female heroin addict was chosen as a model example to show that the simultaneous activities by a variety of offices or bodies is rarely crowned with succes. The author surveys several other cases where similar protacted mechanisms of decision to be arrive at by bodies who might be requested to bear the cost interfered with the therapy in patients addicted to alcohol and\/or drugs. A suggestion is presented aiming at arriving at a decision in minimum time and according to a compact pattern.","3055":"In a half-way house a behaviorally oriented rehabilitation training with chronic schicophrenics, hospitalized more than 12 years averagely, was conducted and evaluated. With interviews it was systematically investigated with what kind of difficult situations a patient is confronted at discharge and which behavioral competencies are therefore especially needed. Behavior therapy with the main components of instruction, behavior rehearsal and social reinforcement changed the behavior of the patients significantly. A general plan for diagnosis and training of competencies is developed that can be applied to structure the training of the staff in educational-therapeutic behavior as well as the training of the patients themselves.","3056":"","3057":"The article reports on the planning and realization of a two-weeks' therapeutic recreation programme involving addicts and their partners. Twelve couples participated, of whom 10 men and 4 women were addicts (alcohol and drugs) who had just completed a successful four-months' withdrawal treatment course on an inpatient basis. The aim was to change partnership interaction patterns via systematic training of communication rules according to a sort of \"model\" design. Tape playback and group feedback techniques were used. The result of this communication training was greater mutual frankness of the partners. The positive results of this type of married-couple therapy encouraged the authors to institutionalize concomitant communication therapy in collaboration with the couples themselves during inpatient withdrawal treatment.","3058":"","3059":"","3060":"","3061":"","3062":"","3063":"Schizophrenia is an impossible concept. Under this heading, a number of psychoses is being grouped which have the common characteristic that the patient is, as a rule, but by no means always, fully conscious. In all other respects, no other points agree, neither in respect of symptoms, nor in respect of etiology or prognosis. Hence, there are hardly any reasons to reduce these disease patterns to a common denominator, either as \"schizophrenia\" or as a \"group of schizophrenic psychoses\". Rather, it seems more probable that schizophrenic psychoses are individual disease patterns, instead of being variations of a basic type. What is principally needed at this stage, is a fair amount of empirical research to catalog the concept of schizophrenia. Such a catalog would have to be based on exactly defined and described syndromes to enable further study whether there are any other points besides these symptoms which characterize the syndrome in question, such as etiology, pathogenetic factors, course, or response treatment. The more characteristics are found, the greater the chance that the disease pattern under investigation is really a unit by itself. In the course of these studies, and in order to avoid terminological confusion, it is advisable to use, for the time being, the term \"schizophrenic psychoses\", under the condition that in each concrete case this term must be supplemented by a careful typification of the symptomatology, of the etiologic factors, and of the course of the disease.","3064":"","3065":"","3066":"20 couples, each of which with one spouse suffering from schizophrenia, are investigated with clinical and psychological (individual and consensus Rorschach, Freiburg personality inventory) methods. Married schizophrenics seem to be less schizoid than passive dependent, infantile or stormy in their premorbid personality. Regarding our results their spouses don't differ in their mental health from the average population. Behaviour disorders of the non-schizophrenic spouses rather have to be seen as reactions caused secondarily by the patient's schizophrenic symptoms than as characteristics of their primary personality, because they only arise in the exploration of both spouses together. The schizophrenics appear less disturbed in the interaction with their spouses than in the situation of the single exploration. The \"interacting personality\" of the non-schizophrenic spouses, however, seems to be more disturbed than their \"individual personality\". Special factors, which are connected with premorbid personality of the later schizophrenic, are important in the mate selection. Very often first manifestation and the course of schizophrenic syndrome on the one hand and the marital dynamics on the other hand are closely related. Describing the attitude of the spouses to each other the non-schizophrenic shows three characteristic patterns, which are seen in the interaction of the couple: acceptation, emotional distance and ambivalence. Further the question of indication and prospect of marital therapy is discussed.","3067":"This publication represents a critical review of the literature published so far on the concept of Double Bind (db). The article attempts to describe the development of this concept since its inception by Bateson et al. twenty years ago. The article also illuminates the partly distinctly neglected reference aspect of db, as well as the recent suggestions of a radical reformulation of concept according to which db is no longer a necessarily pathogenous deformation of communication. Since it can be shown that db is a so to say ubiquitous communicative phenomenon, the question as to whether it is specific for schizophrenia, can be definitely negated. An analysis of the quantitative empirical studies published so far, the analysis being viewed under the aspect of a critical review of the methods employed, shows that the development of a methodically and conceptually adequate experimental model which can completely cover db, has not yet proved successful. It becomes evident that the term \"db hypothesis\" is misleading insofar as this should be considered as a rather comprehensive theoretical construction not easily liable to direct experimental testing, which can be considered as possessing the character of a new paradigm.","3068":null,"3069":"Rates of admission, duration of hospitalization, chances of discharge and legal basis of admissions are analyzed with reference to the distances between the patients' domiciles and the hospital, basing on the figures which apply to the district hospitals Gabersee in Upper Bavaria. More patients from nearby are admitted, and also given long-term treatment, than from the more distant zones; in the long run, chances of discharge are not more favorable for patients living nearby; there is no variation regarding the share of voluntary admissions in relation to the distances between the respective domiciles and the hospital. These results show that there must be increased cooperation between hospitals or wards for inpatients, partial inpatients, and outpatients, in view of the expected increased hospitalization frequency in future psychiatric practice located in the immediate vicinity of the individual districts. Under no circumstances should it happen that instead of the expected saving in the number of hospital beds, the overall capacity of the hospitals is increased.","3070":"","3071":"This paper reports on the first 12 months during which a large psychiatric hospital was undergoing reorganization and reform, resulting outwardly in a reduction of the number of occupied beds from 870 to 730, and in an increase in the number of admissions from 2100 to 2800. Despite sociopsychiatric orientation of the reformatory measures, medical and biological steps were taken first. Second in importance were the matters concerning reorganization in the sense of a differentiation between the various treatment groups. This was associated with the parallel development of initial socio-therapeutic approaches.","3072":"Definitive contraception or voluntary sterilization in men and women has become more and more common as a final and permanent contraceptive measure. This family planning method combines all advantages of contraceptives under the psychological prerequisites: independent and free decision, clear motivation regarding the renouncement of reproduction, agreement between the partners, balanced partnership and personality, detailed advice before the operation. These prognostic criteria are derived from the author's evaluation of 73 psychologico-psychiatric series of catamneses of the past five decades in international literature.","3073":"A psychic crisis is defined as a reaction to external events where the individual is unable to cope with these events by means of his usual adaptive mechanisms and earlier experiences. Examples of a traumatic crisis is the death of a near relative, the sudden onset of a severe illness, a sudden infidelity in marriage etc. So called transitional life situations may also elicit crisis reaction, i.e. the birth of a first child, retirement from work etc. A psychic crisis is often overdetermined from experiences in early childhood. The more \"pure\" crisis reactions are often seen in medical or surgical clinics while the psychiatrists usually meet the overdetermined crisis reaction. Four different phases of the crisis reaction are described. The goal of crisis therapy is to support the individual's and his surroundings own resources. It is not to replace the loss or to help the individual deny the emotional impact of what has happened. The function of the therapist can often be described in terms of \"containing function\" and \"vicarious hope\". Listening to a client in acute crisis often evokes feelings of anxiety and helplessness in the therapist. He often feels seduced to behave omnipotently, helping the patient to suppress the feelings of sorrow and anger. He may also be overprotective or may avoid discussing the pertinent feelings. The antitherapeutic risks of crisis psychotherapy are discussed and also illustrated with examples from the author's research on reactions of mothers to the birth of stillborn children.","3074":"The psychiatric hospital is conceptualized as a social organism with its own development. Every important change or new development follows certain laws. When those steps of phases of development are known their unfolding can be guided more easily. Resistance must be expected and tends to hinder the planned development. There is also a risk of wrong or defective development, endangering the overall goal. The different systematic phases, resistances or risks in changing a psychiatric hospital from a traditional-custodial to a milieu-active institution are summarized in a table. The described milieu therapy is that of a therapeutic community; its conceptualization is briefly discussed. Milieu therapy as a term is at the same time understood in a inclusive and in a complementary way: Inclusive in so far as all therapeutic procedures in a hospital are coordinated via milieu therapy; complementary in the sense that all activities which take place beside the classical therapies (pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy, etc.) are understood as therapeutic activities.","3075":"The article discusses the hospital laws of several land governments enacted subsequent to the hospital financing law of the Federal Government, in respect of the influence exercised by these laws on the internal structure of the hospital. The fact that the laws apply to all kinds of hospitals, and hence also to big psychiatric hospitals, is considered a disadvantage for psychiatric care. Such care is obviously hampered, on the one hand, by the legislative demand for departmentalization of the individual fields according to specialist subjects, representing a setup which is opposed to the realization of patient care in accordance with the requirements of the communities and citizens who expect to be cared for on an individual and not on a schematic basis, whereas, on the other hand, the new structures of management stipulated by the law do not provide for the inclusion of representatives of the new groups of professions now engaged in psychiatric activities. The model of regrouping the hospital structure into sectors instead of medical specialist departments, is presented and contrasted with the proposed model. It is recommended to arrange for representation of the non-medical and non-nursing professions in the managing boards, as well as to take into account the sociotherapeutico-rehabilitative interests as forming part of the conceptual approach to care in psychiatric hospitals, via special hospital committees.","3076":"The preparation of a young candidate for several state examinations which she took during the aftermath of a psychotic episode is described casuistically. Her case once again raises the question of how a psychosocial system working on the therapeutic community principle can reconcile an individual aid program with precisely this community principle and the rejection of unjustified privileges for selected patients.","3077":"One fixed day the doctors of a Psychiatric University Clinic were asked what form of therapy would be best for each of their inpatients (n = 164), and whether these patients could leave the inpatient treatment in case the desired ambulant therapy institutions existed. Half a year after this inquiry questionnaires were sent to the patients, and 104 replies were received. The opinions of the patients which treatment would have bee best for them were compared the doctors' judgements. Both, doctors and patients wanted more ambulant therapy opportunities than existed. There was little unity between doctors and patients about the question with patient would profit from what sort of therapy. We assume that a deciding factor in this disagreement between doctors and patients is the doctor-patient-relationship.","3078":"The opinions of four psychiatric diagnostic groups (schizophrenia, depression, addiction, neuroses) concerning 11 methods of treatment are compared. In the effects of treatment there were as well similarities as differences specific for each of the above groups. Surprisingly similar to a corresponding American investigation, the traditional concept of treatment therapist and drug is considered the most effective.","3079":"The importance of musicotherapy as a type of treatment within the framework of psychiatry is examined. Musicotherapy, as used in the treatment of schizophrenia, is considered to be a communicative therapy with a tendency to regression. A plan for treating psychotics with a non-verbal and a verbal track is outlined. The special approach to patients offered via musicotherapy is seen as follows. The terapist-patient relationship is established on a preverbal communicative level in a zone which is free from anxiety. The shelter afforded by a common musical experience enables self-regulation of the balance between symbiosis and separation, and hence the development of a therapist-patient relationship. The feedback provided by establishing structured objects represents an integration aid for the self and the ego of the patient. Therapy practised as active group musicotherapy forms part of a social field within the group.","3080":"In a town area of 140 000 inhabitants an organized psychiatric treatment and welfare unit with an out-patient department and complementary services has been built up based on a day-and-night clinic dating from 1969 and a clinic which opened in December 1972. In co-operation with other persons and institutions working in the psychosocial field it cares for mentally ill adults of the region, including addicts and mentally ill aged persons. The stages of development, the present-day structure and functioning of the system are described; in particular, problems are discussed which arise from the shifting of treatment, aid and care from the intramural to the extramural sector as a result of the consistent application of the communal aid concept.","3081":"The report begins with a short summary of the various types and forms of self-help groups and their distribution.

In 47 patients we analyzed symptoms typical of \"illness behavior\" (e.g. complaining tendency, depression, irritability, psychosomatic pain, problems in job performance and social interaction) as possible targets for behavior modification. We then developed a behavioral training program to teach the patients various techniques of self-control (relaxation, desensitization, self-image training, analysis and control of illness behavior, assertiveness, performance techniques), our program being based on studies in the U.S.A. using similar approaches. For a preliminary testing two groups of 8 and 6 patients each were treated by different therapists. The patients worked through a section of the program manual prior to each group session. During the sessions proper (a total of 8 weekly two-hour sessions) the different techniques were practiced under the therapist's supervistion. In both groups a significant reduction in illness behavior as indicated on questionnaires and in 3-month follow-up was found.
