English and Persian databases were searched until March 18, 2021. The quality of the published papers was evaluated using Cochrane Handbook and the meta-analysis was conducted in RevMan 5.3. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. In cases with substantial heterogeneity, a random effects model was used instead of a fixed effects model. A total of 387 papers were obtained from the databases. Finally, 10 papers with a sample size of 1100 participants entered the systematic review and a meta-analysis was conducted on nine of them. The results of the meta-analysis of two studies indicated that using vitamin E and omega-3 in combination significantly reduced the intensity of hot flushes compared to the placebo (mean difference (MD): -0.35; 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.21). The mean frequency (MD: -0.50; 95% CI: -1.58 to 0.58) and intensity (SMD: -0.61; 95% CI: -1.50 to 0.29) of hot flushes in the omega-3 group and the frequency of hot flushes (SMD: -0.21; 95% CI: -0.47 to 0.04) in the vitamin E group showed no significant differences with the placebo. No serious adverse effects were reported in the studies.

A 77-year-old woman had a three-year history of hirsutism, male-pattern baldness and increased libido alongside elevated androstenedione, total testosterone and free androgen index levels. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed bilateral ovarian lesions, suggesting ovarian hyperthecosis. Histopathology obtained after a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy confirmed ovarian hyperthecosis and hilus cell hyperplasia. We believe it's the first time they have been reported to occur in combination. The symptoms resolved within a month of surgery. This case highlights the difficulties of diagnosis alongside demonstrating the importance of management by a multidisciplinary team.","4":"This guidance refers to urogenital atrophy, a chronic and progressive condition due to estrogen deficiency, most commonly associated with the menopause. There is a potential negative impact on all urogenital tissue quality including the vulva, vagina, bladder and urethra. Symptoms may not become apparent for several years after the menopause and therefore any association is lost, with women accepting symptoms as a normal part of the aging process. There may be reluctance to discuss symptoms with a clinician and this is likely to be linked with under diagnosis and under treatment. Urogenital atrophy has been described as a silent epidemic with lack of awareness affecting an accurate diagnosis and access to treatment. Whilst vaginal estrogen (also referred to as local estrogen) therapy is the best-known treatment, newer drugs and interventions are now available.","5":"In the early part of 2021, the government launched a call for evidence to inform the development of the Women's Health Strategy with the objective of better understanding women's experiences of the health and care system and to help improve the health and wellbeing of women.

This example is used to explore whether such a strategy is a more viable and effective alternative. An online survey was distributed amongst council workers and completed by 189 individuals. The questions covered respondents' own experiences of menopause transition at work (where applicable) and the availability of information and support for menopause at work, as well as a range of contextual factors. Experiences of workplace environments and relationships by those experiencing menopause. Results on menopause experiences in this council are comparable to those in organizations who have implemented menopause policies or guidelines. Contextual factors, including gendered vertical segregation and racism, are highlighted as important factors influencing the experience of menopause transition in the workplace. Early indications suggest that integrating menopause support into a health and well-being strategy helps mainstream menopause issues amongst staff. Long-term assessment is required to consider whether it is more effective than introducing a menopause policy or guidelines. ","8":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) exert a heavy toll on health of women, mainly due to hypertension said to cluster around the period of transition to menopause. This makes this period a good window to target for prevention and control. We therefore sought to determine if this period really heralds arterial hypertension and CVD in women in our environment. We secondarily analysed our population data on CVD risk factors in free living rural residents. The data considered were blood pressure, anthropometric and biochemical variables in women stratified based on menstruation status. There were 488 females, with 218 still menstruating. They were younger (p = .000), had lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p = .000), lower anthropometric indices attaining significance only with waist circumference (p = .001) and lower total cholesterol (p = .001). Controlling for age, statistically significant differences remained for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, and total cholesterol. The menopause transition comes with a worse CVD profile. Blood pressure rises and so are the anthropometric variables and some biochemical parameters that fuel CVD. This could be ascribed to age which is higher with those post-menopausal. Controlling for age in this cohort still showed that transiting from pre- to post-menopause still came with CVD burden. Clinicians should take the opportunity presented by menopause transition to screen for CVD risk factors and initiate either preventive or control measures to mitigate morbi-mortality consequences.

To investigate whether discussion about the surgery causing the menopause, and advice on possible treatments had been documented, I conducted a retrospective study of women undergoing bilateral oophorectomy at a central London teaching hospital from 1st April 2018 to 30th September 2018. Only 30% of women (8 out of 27) in this study had documentary evidence of having received menopause advice around the time of bilateral oophorectomy.","12":null,"13":"","14":null,"15":"The quality of life in menopausal women is considered to be an important health issue in different societies and one of the main objectives of health care in this period. This study aimed to investigate the effects of yoga on improving the quality of life in menopausal women. English databases of Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched to access related articles using keywords of menopause, quality of life, and yoga. Furthermore, Persian equivalents of the same keywords were searched in databases of Google Scholar, SID, and Magiran, in addition to a combination of the keywords. The search interval was from the inspection to January 2020. The quality of the included studied was assessed based on CONSORT 2017 checklist. Out of 120 articles found in the databases, six articles entered the study based on the inclusion criteria and were investigated for intervention methods and consequences.

","16":null,"17":"The menopausal transition is associated with increasing sleep disorders including sleep apnoea and restless leg syndrome. Insomnia is the most common and is recognised as a core symptom of the menopause. Guidelines to support decision making for women with sleep problems during the menopausal transition are lacking. Sleep problems are associated with negative impacts on healthcare utilisation, quality of life and work productivity. Sleep deprivation is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and neurobehavioral dysfunction. Declining oestrogen is implicated as a cause of menopausal sleep disruption. Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and menopausal mood disturbance are also factors in the complex aetiology. VMS commonly precipitate insomnia and, due to their prolonged duration, they often perpetuate the condition. Insomnia in the general population is most effectively treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (also effective in the menopausal transition.) The associations of menopausal sleep disturbance with VMS and depression mean that other treatment options must be considered. Existing guidelines outline effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), CBT and antidepressants. HRT may indirectly help with sleep disturbance by treating VMS and also via beneficial effect on mood symptoms. The evidence base underpinning menopausal insomnia often references risks associated with HRT that are not in line with current international menopause guidelines. This may influence clinicians managing sleep disorders, leading to hesitation in offering HRT, despite evidence of effectiveness. Viewing sleep symptoms on an axis of menopausal symptoms - towards vasomotor symptoms or towards mood symptoms may help tailor treatment options towards the symptom profile.","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":null,"22":"To explore the views of members of the British Menopause Society on the management of women with unscheduled bleeding on hormone replacement therapy. An electronic cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Investigations, treatment options and preferences for the management of women with unscheduled bleeding on hormone replacement therapy.

This was a prospective cohort study with data collected over a seven-month period from December 2019 to June 2020. All women reviewed at the specialist menopause services following treatment of a malignancy, BRCA carriers and Lynch syndrome were included in the study, with management options divided into three categories: hormonal, non-hormonal and no treatment. The primary outcome of this study was to identify prescribing patterns for all women reviewed following a diagnosis of a malignancy, as well as those with genetic mutations necessitating risk-reducing prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy (BSO). Altogether 71 women were included in this study, with the majority of women post management of a non-gynaecological malignancy (51\/71, 72%), of which breast cancer was the most common (37\/71, 52%). While non-hormonal treatment was the most popular among those treated for breast cancer, for all other malignancies, hormonal treatment was more widespread. Fourteen women also had genetic mutations, with all of these women commencing hormonal treatment post risk reducing surgery. With the exception of those with a history of hormone-sensitive breast cancer, the use of hormonal treatment for menopausal symptoms remained widespread. While this was a relatively small study, the need for long-term follow-up across specialist menopause services, to assess the risk of recurrence is vital.

It is a common consequence of the menopause, with possibly up to 80% of women experiencing symptoms. Despite a number of different diagnostic methods, there is no validated objective method by which to confirm the diagnosis in clinical practice and research settings. Education, for women and clinicians, is called for to support diagnosis and treatment. However, before this can be of global benefit, development of an accessible and reproducible diagnostic test is required. Current assessment methods include routine history and clinical examination, with the clinician's opinion based on their subjective observations. A vaginal smear to assess the ratio of superficial to parabasal cells and measurement of the pH of the vaginal secretions is more commonly used in research settings. A number of formulae have been postulated to facilitate the diagnosis including the Vaginal Health Index, the Vulval Health Index, the Genitourinary Syndrome of the Menopause assessment tool, the Genital Health Clinical Evaluation and vaginal biopsy and assessment of the vaginal microbiome. However, none of these potential methods of assessment has been validated. This article focuses on what we do not know about urogenital atrophy including the prevalence, the most appropriate terminology, aetiology, pathogenesis and the most objective and reproducible method of assessment.","34":"Menopause is a major life event affecting all women in a variety of ways, both short and long term. All women should have access to accurate information, available in all forms and through all recognised sources. All healthcare professionals should have a basic understanding of the menopause and know where to signpost women for advice, support and treatment whenever appropriate. Every primary care team should have at least one nominated healthcare professional with a special interest and knowledge in menopause. All healthcare professionals with a special interest in menopause should have access to British Menopause Society Menopause Specialists for advice, support, onward referral and leadership of multidisciplinary education. With the introduction of the comprehensive British Menopause Society Principles and Practice of Menopause Care programme, the society is recognised throughout the UK as the leading provider of certificated menopause and post reproductive health education and training for healthcare professionals.

Peri and menopausal women are at risk of hyperglycemia, prediabetes and attendant metabolic disturbances. Hormone replacement therapy increases insulin receptor sensitivity, but may precipitate an increased cardiovascular risk, depending on the route, if not commenced within the proposed period denoted by the 'timing hypothesis'. The therapeutic ideal of dietary modification with increased physical activity may have compliance issues. We theorize that selected antidiabetic agents reduce visceral fat deposits, restore insulin sensitivity and inhibit inflammatory mediator release. Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and even metformin are worthy interventions to treat menopausal-induced obesogenic metabolic conditions. Loss of visceral fat restores insulin receptor sensitivity, decreases central obesity and adipokines to halt dysmetabolic changes.","41":"","42":null,"43":"","44":null,"45":"","46":"Vulval irritation and discomfort can be a common presentation to both primary and secondary care.

At the age of 18, patients may then be transitioned to an adult service. Continuation of multidisciplinary care for these women requires input from specialist services in menopause care, reproductive medicine and high-risk pregnancy, cardiology, endocrinology, bone health and psychosocial care. A gynaecologist may take on the mantle of lead clinician especially during the perceived reproductive years of a Turner syndrome patient's life, hinging together management input from other disciplines. This review attempts to summarise an overview of the involvement of such a multidisciplinary team in the management of a single but complex condition, through the lens of a gynaecologist.","52":"Requests for management of menopausal symptoms and hormone replacement are increasing in the UK. Referrals to specialist clinics have to be balanced with increasing recommendations within the NHS to improve efficiency and patient care. Retrospective evaluation of clinic records over two months at a district general (Poole Hospital) and tertiary (Guy's Hospital) menopause service. Data on referral origin, reason for referral, interval from referral to review and outcome were collected and compared between trusts. To evaluate and compare referrals and outcomes in a tertiary and district general menopause service and provide recommendations for improving efficiency. Most referrals are from primary care but up to 25% are from other specialties. Half of the appointments are new referrals and 95% of women attend. Of the new referrals, 50% have multiple medical comorbidities, 25% a personal or family history of cancer and 25% treatment resistance; 30% have premature ovarian insufficiency. At Guy's Hospital, 30% are reviewed more than 18 weeks after referral, at Poole Hospital this is 6%. Treatment resistance is reported in half of the women reviewed at follow-up. Menopause services review a complex patient population and the majority of referred women have more than one co-morbidity; they require time, specialist knowledge of current treatment options and a multidisciplinary approach. The main barrier to service efficiency is capacity, particularly in population dense areas; cognitive behavioural therapy and non-hormonal methods appear under-utilised in primary care, as do alternative methods of follow-up within the clinics such as telephone and patient-initiated appointments.

It is common, affecting up to 50% of parous women, and can be accompanied by a number of burdening symptoms. Prolapse has been thrown into the spotlight secondary to mesh-related complications. There are a number of effective treatment options to consider when managing pelvic organ prolapse and most do not require mesh. Patients' choice, comorbidities and likelihood of treatment success should be considered when making decisions about their care. Vaginal mesh surgery is currently on hold in the UK and even prior to this there has been a reduction both in the number of all prolapse surgeries and the number of women seeking surgery to manage their symptoms.

Permission was granted to analyse 1386 periurethral bulking agents and 18,763 retropubic tapes. The primary outcome measure was patient reported global impression of improvement for incontinence with secondary outcomes of change in symptoms of stress incontinence, overactive bladder and complications. Patients undergoing periurethral bulking agents were older than retropubic tapes (mean 59.4 vs. 52.3 years). Urodynamic stress incontinence was the commonest urodynamic diagnosis (periurethral bulking agents 67%, retropubic tapes 77%) but there was a higher proportion of complex diagnoses in the periurethral bulking agents group. 59.2% patients reported 'very much\/much better' on patient reported global impression of improvement for incontinence for periurethral bulking agents compared to 91% for retropubic tapes; 28% patients felt their symptoms of stress incontinence were cured following periurethral bulking agents compared to 77.6% for retropubic tapes and 0.8% developed de novo overactive bladder following periurethral bulking agents compared to 4% with retropubic tapes. There was no difference in outcomes when using periurethral bulking agents as a primary or secondary procedure. There were no intraoperative complications with periurethral bulking agents and fewer post-operative complications compared to retropubic tapes (3.6%). Patient reported success of periurethral bulking agents is lower than retropubic tapes but this is offset by minimal complications despite being an older, more complex patient group. Periurethral bulking agents do appear equally efficacious as a secondary procedure. Information derived from databases can be used during counselling to allow clinicians to demonstrate their own success and complication rates to ensure patients make an informed choice. Patient choice is paramount so all options should be included in full counselling.

Post hoc analysis of the United Kingdom population from the REVIVE-EU Study. The survey contained questions about women's knowledge of menopause and vulvo-vaginal atrophy symptoms, impact on their life and sexual activities, communication with healthcare professionals and treatments. The most frequent symptom of menopause was hot flushes (75%). Vulvo-vaginal atrophy symptoms had a significant impact on participants' ability to enjoy sexual intercourse (66%), spontaneity (62%) and ability to be intimate (61%); however, only 68% of women had been to their healthcare professional for advice. Half of the sample expected that doctors would initiate a discussion of menopausal symptoms and sexual health, but was in fact rare (5%). Only 27% were under current treatment without a clear therapy pattern, of which 43% used vaginal over-the-counter treatments, 28% prescription (Rx), and 13% both. Efficacy was the main limitation for over-the-counter treatments, while for Rx products were side effects and safety. Women highlighted the restoring of the natural condition of the vagina as the main goal for a treatment (35%). Many United Kingdom women did not feel the need to see any healthcare professional for their gynaecological symptoms. Overall satisfaction with treatment was only 44%.

This resulted in a dramatic reduction in hormone replacement therapy prescription and use. However, the findings from the WHI studies have been re-appraised, and the new perspective is reflected in the guidance published by NICE in 2015 in which they recommended that more women be offered hormone replacement therapy as the benefits are now perceived to outweigh the risks for most women. However, controversy continues to surround hormone replacement therapy, and there are probably few areas in medicine where the misuse of terminology causes quite as much confusion as in hormone replacement therapy. Commonly used terms such as 'menopausal hormone therapy' and 'hormone replacement therapy' lack specificity and there is an urgent need for correct terminology to accurately describe the hormones replaced.","64":null,"65":null,"66":"The aim of this study was to repeat a previous audit, performed from 2009 to 2013, for the cohort of 2018 to determine how the resistance rates in urinary pathogens in women over 18 years of age have changed.

In contrast, it is recommended that symptomatic women at high baseline risk due to a family history or a biopsy-confirmed high-risk benign breast condition and those with previous breast cancer should be managed initially with lifestyle changes and non-hormonal alternatives.

Pain and vaginal dryness can occur whether a woman has a sexual partner or not. In women with breast cancer, the aetiology of impaired sexual functioning, and lowered sexual desire, is often multifactorial, and may be related to physical and\/or psychological reasons. Pain and vaginal dryness in women without a history of breast cancer can usually be safely treated with vaginal estrogens, in the form of a cream, pessary or ring, and simple lubricants or vaginal moisturisers.

Results Several common reasons for referral were identified. Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido and dyspareunia, resulted in 11 (22%) referrals. Ten (20%) women were troubled by persistent symptoms or side effects from HRT; 9 (18%) women were referred before hormone replacement therapy was discussed or commenced; 7 (14%) women seeking advice for their menopausal symptoms had a family or personal history of cancer; 5(10%) were migraineurs; 2(4%) women had premature ovarian insufficiency; 2(4%) were denied hormone replacement therapy because of concern about venous thromboembolism risk; and 4 (8%) had miscellaneous medical disorders. Over 25% of referrals were older than 60. Conclusion Menopausal symptoms are predominately dealt with in primary care where advice and support is needed. National Institute for Health Care and Excellence published guidance regarding onward referral to a specialist menopause clinic, which is vague and referral patterns are haphazard. Our audit highlighted areas of clinical uncertainty and formed the basis for providing local pre-referral information and advice. Some of the information provided is quite detailed and aimed at healthcare professionals with a special interest in menopause. Further training is now required to improve the quality of referrals.

Common causes of arthralgia and arthritis in this population are discussed. The epidemiological and trials evidence for the effects of hormone replacement therapy on musculoskeletal pain and arthritis (primarily from RCTs of HRT for other menopausal symptoms) are discussed. Lastly, the possible underlying aetiological roles of sex hormones including estrogen, and their deficiency, in predisposing to musculoskeletal pain and arthritis are overviewed. Although the association appears strong, a causal link between estrogen deficiency and musculoskeletal pain or different types of arthritis is lacking; there have been few studies specifically within this group of symptomatic patients, and there is much still to understand about musculoskeletal pain and arthritis at the time of the menopause, and about how we might prevent or treat this.","115":"Objective To estimate the prevalence of vaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women with breast cancer exposed to aromatase inhibitors, and to investigate if the risk of vaginal symptoms is associated with previous episodes of bacterial vaginosis.

Semiquantitave questionnaires and telephone interview were used to assess the prevalence of vaginal symptoms and previous episode(s) of bacterial vaginosis. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between vaginal symptoms and previous episodes of bacterial vaginosis. Results Moderate to severe symptoms due to vaginal itching\/irritation were experienced by 6.4% (95% CI: 2.8-14.1%), vaginal dryness by 28.4% (95% CI: 19.4-39.5%), and dyspareunia by 23.1% (95% CI: 11.0-42.1%). Patients with earlier episodes of bacterial vaginosis had an increased risk of vaginal dryness when exposed to a treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, adjusted OR 5.5 (95% CI 1.3-21.6).

Furthermore to describe and identify their needs, which should be met in future healthcare services. Methods We conducted a phenomenological qualitative study. We included 17 women aged 52-65 and collected data through semi-structured interviews. We analysed data following Giorgi's methodology. Findings Needs among the women were classified into three main themes: (1) needs of targeted and tailored information about osteoporosis, (2) needs of being prepared for GP visit to participate in treatment decision-making and (3) needs of being able to take care of bone health. Conclusion and implications In general the women experienced as been left 'in limbo', and they requested targeted and tailored information about osteoporosis. In particular, they want information about dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan results and treatment options in advance of the GP visit. This will help them in being prepared and able to participate in treatment decisions. They ask for support in self-management of the disease with less focus on disease and risk of fracture. Instead, they demand more attention on the benefits of detecting early stage osteoporosis.

This has led to a shift in the age distribution of women living with HIV in the UK, with one in three attending for HIV care estimated to be aged 45-56 years in 2014. The lack of experience of many HIV physicians in managing menopause, and the perceived complexity of managing menopause in women living with HIV by general practitioners means that many women are unable to access appropriate care and support. This is aggravated by the relative paucity of data on menopause in women living with HIV and conflicting results in this field, for example with regard to age of onset of menopause and symptomatology experienced. Furthermore, women living with HIV have unique considerations such as potential interactions between antiretroviral therapy and menopause hormone therapy (previously called hormone replacement therapy) and other physiological concerns such as a multifactorial propensity towards decreased bone mineral density and potentially increased cardiovascular risk. On the whole, menopause hormone therapy is probably underutilised in this group of women due to perceived concerns around drug-drug interactions, as well as fears shared with women in the general population about menopause hormone therapy.

Migraine is affected by fluctuating estrogen levels with evidence to support estrogen 'withdrawal' as a trigger of menstrual attacks of migraine without aura, while high estrogen levels can trigger migraine aura. Maintaining a stable estrogen environment with estrogen replacement can benefit estrogen-withdrawal migraine particularly in women who would also benefit from relief of vasomotor symptoms. In contrast to contraceptive doses of ethinylestradiol, migraine aura does not contraindicate use of physiological doses of natural estrogen. In women with migraine with or without aura, using only the lowest doses of transdermal estrogen necessary to control vasomotor symptoms minimizes the risk of unwanted side effects. Cyclical progestogens can have an adverse effect on migraine so continuous progestogens, as provided by the levonorgestrel intrauterine system or in continuous combined transdermal preparation, are preferred. There are no data on the effect of micronized progesterone on migraine, either cyclical or continuous.

There has been a large feminist contribution to both the debate of contraception and menopause in the last few years. Over the years, menopause has been treated in a uniform fashion, as a disease, excluding the different circumstances and lived experiences that patients go through during this sensitive period.

Overall, the risk of breast cancer diagnosis with exposure to hormonal contraception is very small and outweighed by its contraceptive benefits but despite this, there are still outstanding questions for all methods used in clinical practice due to paucity of available evidence, lack of which should not be taken to imply safety. This is exemplified by the following assumptions: the progestogen-only pill and long-acting reversible contraceptives are 'breast-safe' options in peri-menopausal women, use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system for the management of endometrial pathology in breast cancer survivors is less likely to promote disease recurrence and the benefit all hormonal contraceptive methods confer in reducing unplanned pregnancy in women at high familial risk outweigh the risk of breast cancer diagnosis. There is no data on risk with the concurrent prescription of hormone replacement therapy in women exhibiting climacteric symptoms who are still menstruating. Advice of GPs and Community Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health specialists will inevitably be sought about some or all these issues and in the absence of conclusive evidence from clinical studies, caution should be applied and women counselled appropriately.","140":null,"141":null,"142":null,"143":"","144":"","145":"","146":"Objective During and after menopause, the symptoms of vaginal atrophy cause great discomfort and necessitate effective treatment options.

The study also compared the effects of oxytocin with those of estradiol (E2). Study design The effects of both oxytocin and E2 on the proliferation of Vk2E6E7 cells were investigated using Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU Colorimetric Assay. The expression of both oxytocin and oxytocin receptor was studied in Vk2E6E7 cells using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescent staining. Main outcome measures Cell proliferation and gene expression. Results Oxytocin increased cell proliferation both time dependently and dose dependently. This differed from the effect pattern observed in cells treated with E2. In addition, in oxytocin-treated cells, the oxytocin receptor was found to be co-localized with caveolin-1, indicating pro-proliferative signalling within the cell. Conclusions Oxytocin stimulates cell proliferation and the co-localization of oxytocin receptor with caveolin-1 in oxytocin-treated cells, supporting the role of oxytocin signalling in cell proliferation.

We prospectively assessed postmenopausal women attending the urogynaecology clinic for a pessary change. We asked them about the level of discomfort during pessary change (visual analogue scale for pain), discharge, bleeding and infection. Ethics approval was not required as this was a service evaluation project. Statistical analysis for relative risk was performed, including sub-group analysis for 'ring pessary' and 'non-ring group' (Shelf, Gellhorn, Shaatz). Between July 2013 and December 2014, we assessed 120 postmenopausal women using support pessaries for prolapse. The mean age was 70 years; 45% of the patients used vaginal estrogen. There were no statistically significant differences in complications with or without vaginal estrogen use, although the trend was higher amongst non-users. The 'non-ring' sub-group not using vaginal estrogen had a higher risk of vaginal ulceration, bleeding and discharge. Postmenopausal women may have lesser complications when using vaginal estrogen with a support pessary for prolapse, particularly with pessaries other than the ring. An adequately powered randomised controlled trial is needed to assess conclusively whether vaginal estrogen enhances comfort and reduces complications of support pessaries for prolapse. ","190":"Vulval and vaginal symptoms are common after the menopause and are frequently assumed to be due to the normal physiological changes that occur at this time. However, there are several important dermatoses that can occur in this patient group which need accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. This review discusses the clinical features and basic management of some of the common vulval problems occurring after the menopause.

Therefore, it is important for clinicians to consider the breast safety profile of any hormone-based therapy used in postmenopausal women. This review provides an overview of the breast safety and tolerability profiles of currently marketed selective estrogen receptor modulators, antiestrogens, and the first tissue selective estrogen complex combining conjugated estrogens with the selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene in postmenopausal women. Selective estrogen receptor modulators and antiestrogens act as estrogen receptor antagonists in the breast. Tamoxifen, toremifene, and the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant are used to treat breast cancer, and tamoxifen and raloxifene protect against breast cancer in high-risk women. Postmenopausal women using selective estrogen receptor modulators for prevention or treatment of osteoporosis (raloxifene, bazedoxifene) can be reassured that these hormonal treatments do not adversely affect their risk of breast cancer and may, in the case of raloxifene, even be protective. There are limited data on breast cancer in women who use ospemifene for dyspareunia. Conjugated estrogens\/bazedoxifene use for up to two years did not increase mammographic breast density or breast pain\/tenderness, and there was no evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer, suggesting that conjugated estrogens\/bazedoxifene has an improved breast safety profile compared with traditional menopausal hormone therapies. Future research will continue to focus on development of selective estrogen receptor modulators and selective estrogen receptor modulator combinations capable of achieving the ideal balance of estrogen receptor agonist and antagonist effects.

Completion of an electronic survey. General practitioners and practice nurses working in West Cheshire. To provide evidence for future local commissioning of menopause services. Ninety-one clinicians working within West Cheshire were sent an email request to complete the survey with 53 responses received (58%). The majority were general practitioners and were within the 35-54 year age range. The majority perceived that, each week in their clinical practice, they see between one and eight women who are affected by peri- or post-menopausal symptoms. Regarding their self-reported skills and knowledge in managing the menopause, almost half felt they had 'good' knowledge but 'recognised (they) had learning needs'. Seven of the 53 (13%) felt their skills were 'not good'. Two-thirds of those clinicians who completed the survey felt that they and their patients should have access to a specialist menopause service locally. In the area covered by West Cheshire clinical commissioning group, there is no currently commissioned menopause service. This study has demonstrated that a substantial number of women present each week to clinicians working in this area who are felt to have peri- or post-menopausal symptoms. The clinicians have self-reported learning needs. Qualitative data from the survey would suggest training can be difficult to access. There is a clear need, both ethically and medically, for the commissioning of a West Cheshire specialist menopause service, with the proposed model being an integrated and holistic care model. Menopause care, and post-reproductive healthcare generally, provides an opportunity for collaboration and partnership working within an outcomes-based commissioning model. This study could be reviewed and replicated in other areas for comparison.

More women were able to respond positively to the question asking whether or not they felt able to make an informed choice regarding HRT\/alternative therapies. There has been negativity and confusion regarding HRT management since the beginning of the millennium. Our findings suggest that we, as health professionals, continue to let our patients down with poor provision of information, inaccurate or wrong information, or access to the right care.

","211":"Pelvic organ prolapse is a common gynaecological problem. Surgical techniques to repair prolapse have been constantly evolving to reduce the recurrence of prolapse and need for reoperation. Grafts made of synthetic and biological materials became popular in the last decade as they were intended to provide extra support to native tissue repairs. However, serious complications related to use of synthetic meshes have been reported and there is increasing medico-legal concern about mesh use in prolapse surgery. Some mesh products already have been withdrawn from the market and the FDA has introduced stricter surveillance of new and existing products. Large randomized studies comparing mesh with non-mesh procedures are lacking which creates uncertainty for the surgeon and their patients.The small cohorts of the RCTs available with short follow-up periods just allow the conclusion that the mesh repair can be helpful in the short to medium term but unfortunately are not able to prove safety for all patients. In particular, current clinical reports cannot define for which indication what material may be superior compared to non-mesh repair.Quality control through long-term individual and national mesh registries is needed to keep a record of all surgeons using mesh and all devices being used, monitoring their effectiveness and safety data. Meshes with better biocompatibility designed specifically for use in vaginal surgery may provide superior clinical results, where the reduction of complications may allow a wider range of indications.

Unfortunately, resultant menopausal symptoms sometimes limit the tolerability and duration of such treatment. The use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists to treat these diseases can result in short-term hypoestrogenic and vasomotor side effects as well as long-term impacts on bone health and cardiovascular risk. The routine use of add-back hormone replacement has reduced these risks and increased patient compliance, making this group of drugs more useful as a medium-term treatment option. The estrogen threshold hypothesis highlights the concept of a 'therapeutic window' in which bone loss is minimal but the primary disease is not aggravated. It explains why add-back therapy is appropriate for such patients and helps to explain the basis behind new developments in the treatment of hormonally responsive gynaecological conditions such as gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists and progesterone receptor modulators.

The results showed that both study groups had positive attitudes towards sexuality and sexual healthcare of mid-life and older women. However, cSRH trainees had significantly more confidence in dealing with psychosexual problems and perceived significantly less barriers to deliver comprehensive menopausal care within the mostly community-based Sexual &amp; Reproductive Healthcare settings they are working in compared to their mainly hospital-based gynaecological colleagues.

An unpredictable ovarian function is observed in 50% of patients with 5-10% being able to achieve a pregnancy. Longitudinal studies have shown a temporary decline in bone mineral density of up to 5% during pregnancy and lactation in healthy women, with the loss of bone density post-partum being proportional to the period of breastfeeding. Effects of pregnancy in women with premature ovarian insufficiency have not been widely documented. Nevertheless, a lower bone mineral density baseline has been observed pre-conceptually, associated with both the hypoestrogenic state of the condition and the possibility that premature ovarian insufficiency was developed prior to achieving peak bone mass. This may suggest that breastfeeding could cause further deterioration in bone mineral density that may not be easy to recover from due to the reduced baseline levels.

This occurs because of physiological changes such as replacement of muscle fibres with collagen, from life effect insults such as the effects of childbirth, lead to a reduction in contractility and changes in the nerve supply from cholinergic to NANC fibres lead to a change in sensation leading to a delay in first sensation. Symptoms are often similar to those of overactive bladder and the history in older women should include those of hesitancy and poor flow. Likewise, the diagnosis should be considered in women presenting with recurrent urinary tract infections. A failure to consider voiding difficulties can precipitate a crisis and simple strategies such as teaching self-catheterization and using estrogen cream may prevent problems occurring. When acute problems occur, catheterization is required and a review of precipitating factors may identify medications contributing to the condition.

Ninety-seven women (58%) who had been pregnant had suffered both premenstrual depression and postnatal depression. All were treated with transdermal estrogens and 93% also had transdermal testosterone. One hundred and seventy-one patients had a uterus and received cyclical progestogen to protect the endometrium and 63% of these developed the premenstrual syndrome-type symptoms of progesterone intolerance during the progestogen days. Thirty-five percent of patients claimed to be cured and 55% had a considerable improvement with estrogen therapy. Only 3.7% reported that there was no improvement.
