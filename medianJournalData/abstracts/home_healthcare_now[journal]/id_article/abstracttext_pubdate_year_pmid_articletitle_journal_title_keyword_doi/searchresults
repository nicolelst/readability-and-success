the population of the United States has aged, the number of home care patients with multiple chronic diseases has also increased. A review of the literature suggested that layering palliative care principles on traditional home healthcare could improve outcomes for patients with advancing disease. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to educate home care staff on the use of assessment and management tools to identify symptoms and provide symptom control, prevent unnecessary hospitalizations, and reduce healthcare costs in patients with advancing disease. This project took place at eight offices of a national home care agency in Kentucky and Indiana. Nurses, social workers, and therapists attended mandatory education sessions over 5 months on integrating palliative care principles into care planning for home care patients and using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and state-specific end-of-life planning tools. Symptoms were tracked and managed. A paired-samples t-test was used to analyze ESAS scores. Hospitalization and rehospitalization rates and costs were compared and benchmarked. Some symptoms worsened from beginning to end of the episode of care, suggesting a need for additional staff training about symptom management. The wide range of symptoms and symptom worsening suggest the need for individualized care, possibly extended home healthcare, and the inclusion of a more formal palliative care course for staff on symptom management.","10":"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant strain on home healthcare clinicians, shifting the focus of care to essential physical care needs. Spiritual care needs have always been present, but the pandemic has heightened recognition of the importance of spiritual care in home care. The goals of spiritual care include promoting physical healing, improving quality of life, and enhancing patient and family wellbeing. The use of a standardized spiritual assessment tool can increase provider awareness and patient expression of spiritual care needs. Spiritual care activities consist of obtaining a spiritual history, compassionate presence, mindful listening, interprofessional collaboration, and the provision of space for spiritual practices. This article provides a conceptual overview and strategies for application of spiritual care competencies.","11":"The purpose of this article is to introduce a descriptive middle-range theoretical framework unique to professional nursing practice provided in the patient's home. The variety of care models provided in the home, ranging from nonskilled home maintenance service to hospital-at-home programs, reinforces the need to clearly define and describe home-based professional nursing practice. This framework includes six concepts (primacy of home, patient authority, patient self-management, caregivers as collaborators, interprofessional clinical team collaboration, nurse autonomy), and four relational statements of the concepts that describe the experience of patients in their homes and home-based providers. The four theoretical statements are: (1) The patient's beliefs, habits, and self-management actions in the home are shaped by the meaning of home and the physical home environment. (2) The patient has ultimate decision-making control and authority over his\/her own health-related behaviors in the home. (3) Home-based care includes interprofessional teams to provide holistic care and maximize self-management ability. (4) The home-based nurse is autonomous when working in the home with the patient\/caregiver and has primary responsibility for holistic assessment and intervention. Knowledge of this theoretical framework can help nurses maintain the integrity and purpose of the professional nurse's role in home-based care as well as provide guidance for nursing education and organizational structures. Recommendations for research to test and validate the framework are provided.","12":"Interpersonal communication and teamwork are critical to patient safety. There is evidence supporting the effectiveness of formalized team training strategies such as simulation-based learning experiences to permit opportunities for deliberate practice and skill acquisition. However, there is a paucity of evidence examining the best method for delivery of simulation-based interprofessional education activities (Sim-IPE). The purpose of this project was to explore the effectiveness of using a Sim-IPE with a home-based patient assessment and intervention for students in undergraduate nursing, nurse practitioner, and physical therapy programs with the goal of enhancing interprofessional team communication and team performance. A mixed-methods, observational research design was used to evaluate teamwork and communication following virtual\/web-based deliberate practice and a subsequent face-to-face Sim-IPE with telehealth. There were two distinct stages: (1) provision of interprofessional education elements of teamwork and communication via a virtual web-based platform to interprofessional student teams; (2) participation of all 29 student teams in a Sim-IPE activity using a standardized patient in a simulated home-based setting. Teams scored very high on an interprofessional communication and teamwork scale, and students strongly agreed that the prebriefing, scenario, and debriefing assisted in their learning. Students also valued exposure to telehealth and the ability to work with students from other health professions.","13":"This article is part of a series, Supporting Family Caregivers: No Longer Home Alone, published in collaboration with the AARP Public Policy Institute.

Topics of review included: Medicare and private billing structures available for current prevention programs and traditional rehabilitation, the Affordable Care Act and its application to reimbursement of preventive services and direct access care models, and a comparative review of CMS' Patient Driven Group Model (PDGM) home health benefit and Medicare Part B billing and reimbursement. Additionally, a path to launch one prevention-focused program, HOP-UP-PT, is described. There is emerging evidence that upstreaming fall prevention programs can help reduce falls and have money-saving downstream effects. A reimbursement model for this type of programming must be established in order ensure long-term sustainability. Although there is evidence that home-based prevention programs such as HOP-UP-PT can reduce falls and fall-risk metrics among an older adult population, there is not a clear and sustainable payment pathway, which limits proliferation of similar programs. Therefore, this preventative care model which has emerging evidence of cost savings will require reimbursement restructuring beyond what is available with existing payment models.","26":null,"27":"In 2016, the federal government mandated that all Medicaid-funded personal assistance services be documented through an Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) program by January 2020. Most states have asked for extensions due to difficulties in implementation and strong opposition from consumer advocacy groups. Qualitative research has documented various concerns of consumers and consumer advocates. In 2020 (prepandemic), we conducted a mail survey of consumers which included questions regarding familiarity with, and attitudes toward, EVV. Respondents could also write in qualitative comments. This paper explores consumers' perceptions of EVV using four survey items related to fraud, benefits, concerns, and protection and 25 qualitative comments related to these topics. We found that respondents agreed most with statements focused on both concerns with EVV interfering with their care and help in reducing fraud. In general, the most common quantitative response to the statements was indifference. Qualitative comments centered on concerns about EVV interfering with services in a variety of ways, although there were also comments related to EVV being protective, beneficial, or helpful in reducing fraud. We also identified a new category in the qualitative comments about consumers' beliefs that the work done by their personal assistance service workers is underrecognized. We recommend that policy makers and service organizations continue to collect information from consumers as EVV is implemented and altered to both meet the expectations of the legislation and the needs of consumers and workers.","28":"The quality of family caregiver-patient interaction plays a crucial role in the context of chronic conditions. This study investigated the effects of a caregiver educational program on interactions between family caregivers and patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this trial, 92 pairs of family caregivers and patients in a subspecialty lung care clinic located in Birjand, Iran were allocated into intervention and control groups (n = 46 per group). The intervention consisted of eight sessions, including three educational sessions on COPD, two educational sessions on coping strategies, as well as three peer support sessions. The Dyadic Relationship Scale was completed at baseline, posttest, and follow-up (2 months after intervention). For caregivers in the intervention group, positive dyadic interaction improved significantly from baseline to follow-up and from posttest to follow-up in comparison with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Also, for these caregivers, negative dyadic strain enhanced significantly from baseline to posttest and from baseline to follow-up as compared with those in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Finally, in patients of the intervention group, negative dyadic strain from baseline to follow-up and from posttest to follow-up significantly improved when compared with that of control patients (p &lt; 0.05).","29":"This article is part of a series, Supporting Family Caregivers: No Longer Home Alone, published in collaboration with the AARP Foundation.

Falls were a quality concern for a Northeastern home care agency and this project aimed to evaluate the falls prevention process for older adults receiving home care services by determining potential root causes of falls and to identify a practice change. This quality improvement project used a root cause analysis methodology with a retrospective matched case-control design. Records of patients with falls were assessed for falls prevention process fidelity and compared with patients without a fall matched on the Missouri Alliance for Home Care-10 (MAHC-10) assessment, examining plan of care accuracy and patient fall risk factors. Findings indicated fidelity concerns in the fall prevention process, with gaps in care planning aligned with identified risk factors. Interventions to mitigate identified MAHC-10 risk factors on care plans were present less than 50% of the time for four of the six factors. Polypharmacy (7.46%) and pain affecting function (9.21%) were most frequently unaddressed risk factors in the care plan. Recommendations included implementation of a falls prevention pathway, including standardized falls risk assessment, universal falls precautions in the care plan with tailored interventions based on risk factors, and referral initiation when necessary.","44":"Despite an increasing demand for pediatric home care nursing, there is no comprehensive or universal standard of care for prescribing pediatric home care nursing hours based on a child's medical complexity. Adoption of a qualification tool (QT) to allocate home care nursing hours based on the medical complexity of a child may mitigate inequality in access to care and improve the patient and family experience. A QT, developed in Minnesota, recommends home care nursing hours based on the level of medical complexity and need for skilled nursing interventions. Four hypothetical case studies demonstrate the use of the QT to calculate recommended nursing hours. To validate the tool, a survey of discharge planners found a percentage difference in calculated hours of 4.1, 5.7, 11.2, and 24.9 in the four case studies. Discharge planners rated the usability of the QT as favorable with a score of 3.6 on a Likert scale of 5. The recommended nursing hours prescribed for families, based on the QT, was perceived as meeting the needs of the child by 56% and 42% of surveyed parents and home care nurses (HCNs), respectively. The need for additional nursing hours was expressed by 33% and 50% of parents and nurses, respectively. In general, HCNs' assessment of allocated nursing hours paralleled that of parents. Further refinement and adoption of a standardized QT to allocate home care nursing hours may improve access and outcomes for children requiring home care nursing.","45":"Approximately 4.7 million Veterans live in rural areas and face challenges receiving support and care for complex service-connected healthcare needs. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore nurses' experiences caring for Veterans in rural home care\/hospice settings. Semistructured interviews (N = 14) were conducted between August 2020 and March 2021. Content and thematic analysis resulted in three central themes: Mission readiness: Ensuring safe home environments, Partnering with Veterans: Knowing when to lead and when to follow, and It's my duty: Caring with purpose and honor. Study findings highlight the need for cultural competence in both rural and Veteran cultures. Implications for practice reinforce currently emerging national priorities, including personal safety considerations and need for further professional development associated with screening for firearms and gun safety. Other implications for home care\/hospice agencies, as well as nursing education, are discussed.","46":"This article is part of a series, Supporting Family Caregivers: No Longer Home Alone, published in collaboration with the AARP Public Policy Institute.

The purpose of this study was to examine the comfort of hospice staff using telehospice to connect virtually with patients and caregivers. The hospice in this study uses Alpha Virtual Assist (AVA), which employs a commercial remote patient monitoring platform and a communication platform that focuses on holistic patient and caregiver comfort as well as interpersonal and interprofessional communication. A mixed methods research design was used. An online survey of hospice staff that included quantitative and qualitative items was used to collect data. Forty-four hospice staff agreed to participate. No differences were found in comfort levels with using AVA between nurses and other staff. Three themes emerged from the qualitative responses: Positive responses about AVA; AVA as an assistive device; and Problems with connectivity. Hospice staff were comfortable using telehospice technology and have effectively used this tool with hospice patients and their caregivers before and during the pandemic.","58":"Adult home mechanical ventilation (HMV) represents a small but growing vulnerable population in the community. Caring for these patients exposes families to many positive and negative experiences. This study aimed to synthesize the existing qualitative research that examined family members' experiences of caring for adult patients using HMV. Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for qualitative studies conducted with family caregivers of adult patients receiving HMV. Thematic synthesis was conducted to interpret the findings. The GRADE-CERQual approach was used to assess the level of confidence. After completion of the screening process, 11 studies were included. The main theme from the meta-synthesis was the Experience of changing as a person. Families' experiences were divided into three stages over time: (1) Mixed feelings, (2) Challenging, and (3) Continuity. Family experiences illustrate that teamwork with an interprofessional approach based on patient and family needs is required to deliver care, improve clinical outcomes, reduce adverse experiences, and increase family satisfaction.","59":"Access to healthcare is challenging for both Veterans and the nation's general population. To keep up with national primary healthcare needs, the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) implemented Home Based Primary Care (HBPC). After a structure remodel at a Texas VA medical center, 40% of nurse practitioners (NPs) left the HBPC department in one year. The Anticipated Turnover Scale and the Misener NP Job Satisfaction Scale were administered online (n = 7), and results were used to complete a program evaluation. Forty-three percent of participants indicated intent to leave, and 56% of answers indicated job dissatisfaction. Seven categories were identified to mitigate voluntary turnover: Recognition; Shared governance; Orientation; Full practice authority; Collaboration; Organizational workflow maps; and Mentoring. Implementation of recommendations resulting from this project may help retain NPs in both VA and non-VA organizations, reduce organizational costs, support optimal patient outcomes, and increase access to healthcare.","60":"Substance use disorders (SUDs) and high incidence of infectious diseases are both critical public health issues. Among patients who use a venous access device (VAD) in home care settings, SUDs may play a role in increasing their risk of having a concurrent infectious disease. This study examined the association of SUD with infectious diseases among adult home healthcare patients with a VAD. We identified adult patients with an existing VAD who were admitted to a home healthcare agency August 1, 2017-July 31, 2018 from the electronic health records of a large Medicare-certified agency. Four serious infectious diseases (endocarditis, epidural abscess, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis) and SUD related to injectable drugs were identified using relevant ICD-10 codes. Multiple logistic regression was performed to examine the association. Of 416 patients with a VAD, 12% (n = 50) had at least one diagnosis of a serious infectious disease. The percentage of patients who had a serious infectious disease was 40% among those with SUDs, compared with only 11% among those without SUDs. After adjusting for age and sex, the odds of having a serious infectious disease was 3.52 times greater for those with SUDs compared with those without (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 4.52 [1.48-13.79], n = .008). Our findings suggest that home healthcare patients with a VAD and a documented SUD diagnosis may have an increased risk of having a concurrent serious infectious disease. Therefore, patients with an SUD and a VAD would need more attention from home healthcare providers to prevent a serious infectious disease. Further research is suggested on modalities of care for individuals with an SUD and VAD to reduce the incidence of infectious diseases so that care can be delivered safely and efficiently in a home healthcare setting.","61":"With the wide range of clinical skills and responsibilities that home care nurses (HCNs) are expected to perform, it is important they are supported with access to relevant continuing nursing education (CNE) to perform their job safely and effectively. An integrative literature review was conducted to explore the current evidence on CNE for HCNs. Medline and CINAHL were searched and 13 articles that met the criteria were reviewed. The analysis identified three themes: (1) learning strategies (simulation, virtual gaming, elearning, traditional learning); (2) challenges (staffing, time, access, skill) and opportunities (incentive to stay employed, decreased burnout); and (3) learning needs (palliative, patient and family needs, older adults and dementia, acute nursing skills). Nurses who provide care to patients in their homes have very complex roles and responsibilities. In order to keep patients and nurses safe, standards of education for HCNs, beyond their basic education program, must be developed. These educational standards must be designed to address the complex medical needs of patients while making the educational opportunities accessible and value-added. Improving the CNE experience for HCNs has the potential to increase patient safety, improve care outcomes, increase nurse competence, improve retention, and decrease nurse burnout.","62":"Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) resulting from metastatic spread to the pleura frequently occurs in patients with primary lung, breast, hematological, gastrointestinal, and gynecological cancers. These effusions tend to reaccumulate quickly, and the patient requires increasingly frequent thoracentesis. An indwelling pleural catheter allows for dramatic improvement in quality of life as the patient has the power to ease her\/his own suffering by draining the effusion at home when shortness of breath and\/or chest pain intensifies. Patients with MPE need home healthcare support to address symptom management related to complications of advanced metastatic cancer and antineoplasm treatment regimens. The financial obstacles for the home healthcare agency are explored by using agency supply costs, per visit costs, and the patient-driven groupings reimbursement mode grouper to estimate reimbursement. Care for a home healthcare patient with MPE costs Medicare approximately $64.50 per day, markedly less than costs for hospitalization and outpatient thoracentesis. Unfortunately, agencies must absorb the cost of vacuum drainage bottles. Whereas a small positive balance of $291 was estimated for the first 30-day posthospital episode, losses were estimated at $1,185 to $1,633 for subsequent 30-day episodes. Absorbing these costs has become extremely difficult as home healthcare agencies are experiencing unprecedented COVID-19 infection control and staffing-related costs.","63":"","64":"","65":"","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"","72":"","73":null,"74":"The purpose of this article is to discuss the five levels of skill acquisition (novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert) developed by Patricia Benner and colleagues, within the unique context of home health nursing.

Recommendations are made for competence-based clinical support programs such as orientation, mentoring, and clinical ladders that identify, measure, and reward clinical knowledge and skill.","75":"The evaluation of social support within hospital at home (HaH) programs has been limited. We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort evaluation of 295 participants receiving HaH care and 212 patients undergoing traditional hospitalization from November of 2014 to August of 2017. We examined the confounding and moderating effects of instrumental and informational social support upon length of stay and 30-day rehospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit, and skilled nursing facility admission. Instrumental social support attenuated the effects of HaH upon any ED visit (base model: OR 0.61, p = 0.037; controlling for social support: OR 0.71, p = 0.15). The association of HaH with other outcomes remained unchanged. Interactions between HaH and informational or instrumental social support for all outcomes were not significant. Lack of high levels of social support had little effect on the positive outcomes of HaH care, suggesting similar benefits of HaH services for patients with lower levels of social support.","76":"Considering the importance of family caregivers in pressure injury prevention, it is necessary to clearly define their role in pressure injury prevention guidelines. We reviewed the contents of pressure injury prevention guidelines with the aim of defining the role of family caregivers. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Proquest were searched, as well as the internet, as some pressure injury guidelines may not be published in professional journals. Literature published between 2000 and 2020 was searched using the keywords \"pressure injury,\" \"pressure ulcer,\" \"bed sore,\" and \"prevention guideline.\" Ten guidelines related to pressure injury prevention were found. Of these, five guidelines mentioned the role of family caregivers in relation to pressure injury, referring only to the training and empowerment of family caregivers. Of the five guidelines that mentioned caregiver training, only three determined the training content in detail. According to these guidelines, family caregivers should be trained on the risk factors of pressure injuries, characteristics of pressure injuries, intervention to prevent pressure injuries, nutrition, sign and symptoms of pressure injuries, complication such as infection and using protective equipment and devices. In the guidelines that focused on family caregivers, the attention is sometimes limited and vague. Limited attention to the role of family caregivers can lead to lack of awareness and reduced ability of family caregivers to prevent pressure injury and ultimately increase the patient's risk of developing pressure injury.","77":"The death of a patient can be a significant event for professional caregivers. Yet, little attention is paid to the emotional toll this can exert on carers, nor the support they need to cope during this time. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of home carers following the death of a patient. Qualitative data collected through individual semistructured interviews with six United Kingdom home carers were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. A central aspect was the merging of carers' personal and professional losses. Three key themes were: (1) there are no boundaries to loss, (2) coping actions, and (3) a new understanding of life and death. These conversations gave carers a space to share their experiences of grief as well as lessons on their own life and mortality. Learning from these experiences will highlight the complexity of carers' loss and possible sources of support.","78":"Antimicrobial resistance, the ability of microbes to become resistant to known antimicrobial medications, is a growing and serious global health concern. There are growing numbers of publications about efforts to educate nurses about antimicrobial resistance, and efforts to involve nurses in antimicrobial stewardship in acute and long-term care settings; however, this has not been the case in home care. Home care organizations are required to address infection control and surveillance, including patient, family, and staff education. Home care nurses play an important role in identifying infections, performing cultures, and teaching patients and families. This article provides an overview of antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial stewardship and provides antimicrobial stewardship actions for home care nurses and agencies. In the interest of public health, home care agencies and nurses can, and should, educate themselves and patients about antimicrobial resistance and employ antimicrobial stewardship strategies.","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"","88":"With advancing technology, patients with stroke often survive the critical acute phase, but require supportive care by informal caregivers after discharge from the hospital. Little is known about the experiences of these caregivers during the immediate posthospital period. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the opinions and experiences of caregivers of stroke patients who were enrolled in the Transitional Care Model Stroke Turkey (TEMpEST) discharge planning program. Individual interviews were conducted with 23 caregivers of stroke patients about their experiences with the TEMpEST discharge program. Seven subthemes were identified: trust, information, morale, satisfaction, care and concern, follow-up, and continuity. The effectiveness of the program can be assessed by applying the TEMpEST program to different patient groups and conducting in-depth interviews with both patients and their caregivers.","89":"Homebound older adults are a highly vulnerable population, yet little is known about their experiences with healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. We interviewed patients in home-based primary care (HBPC) in New York City by telephone in May and June of 2020. Interviews covered social supports, household activities, self-care, and medical care, and asked participants to compare current with prepandemic experiences. Among 70 participants, 37% were Black and 32% were Hispanic. Disruptions in the home included greater difficulty accessing paid caregivers (13.9%) and food (35.3%) than before the pandemic, and unaddressed household chores (laundry, 81.4%; food preparation, 11.4%). Black study participants were more likely than White and Hispanic participants to report disruptions in accessing medical care (13 [50.0%] vs. 3 [14.3%] vs. 6 [27.3%], respectively, p = 0.02), as well as food preparation and medication taking. Black patients in HBPC are at risk of disparities in healthcare and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic.","90":null,"91":"The home healthcare nurse is a concept that has grown rapidly in the past two centuries, however, the role and meaning remain ambiguous. Continuous changes in the healthcare system have sparked confusion with patients and healthcare providers as to the essence of the home healthcare nurse. With the popularity and demand for home healthcare-based care on the rise, it is necessary to differentiate the concept of the home healthcare nurse from other related terms through a concept analysis. Using Walker and Avant's methodology, a literature search using Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) along with dictionaries, encyclopedias, and professional organizations was performed to identify all the uses, attributes, and characteristics of the concept. Five defining attributes emerged during the analysis: autonomy, adaptability, person-centered holistic care, care coordination, and self-efficacy. Antecedents, consequences and empirical referents were identified. As a first step, this concept analysis brings clarity to the meaning and role of the home healthcare nurse from which arose an operational definition and proposed conceptual model. With the number of patients admitted to home healthcare accelerating, healthcare organizations and clinicians must distinctly understand the concept of the home healthcare nurse. Future research should include testing theoretical relationships between the home healthcare nurse and patient outcome variables to enhance nursing science and promote population health.","92":"Falls are the leading cause of death due to unintentional injuries in the older adult population, and fall-related death rates among older adults are escalating annually. Visual deficits are underrecognized and underdiagnosed, which increases fall risk. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the common types of visual impairment, their etiology, and treatment and to present strategies to reduce falls among older adults with visual impairments. Both traditional home safety interventions and emerging technology-based interventions to reduce falls are described. Appropriate use of both traditional and emerging fall prevention interventions may reduce fall risk and falls among older adult home healthcare patients.","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":"","100":"","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"Family caregivers provide long-term, complex care in home settings where most persons with dementia (PWD) live. These men\/women caregivers differ in responses and approaches to caring problems. Following our review of the research literature and needs assessment from caregivers of PWD (group 1), a comparison revealed key caregiver gender differences in caring problems and approaches. We developed and implemented a Web-based Educational Modules (WBEMs) project focused on gender-based differences to offer unique support for men\/women caregivers who face these problems. Other caregiver evaluators (group 2) agreed the WBEMs were well designed with clear, credible, informative content. Evaluators' suggestions for larger font size and navigation directions were incorporated in module improvements. Six modules were eventually placed on an established university-sponsored caregivers' website. WBEMs have potential to reestablish well-being for caregivers of PWD. Home healthcare nurses and other healthcare providers can use, adapt, or create additional modules to meet the needs of and support for caregivers and patients living in community settings.","105":"Nurses are the primary health professionals who provide home healthcare (HHC) for older people. Measurements of nursing outcomes and quality of care are needed to ensure that older people receive quality nursing care. The objective of this study was to identify HHC nursing outcomes and quality indicators for older people in Thailand. The participants included 22 experts and professional caregivers of older adult HHC patients (i.e., geriatric and HHC policy makers, family physicians, nursing faculty, advanced practice nurses, and registered nurses). The Delphi technique was deployed. Final medians and interquartile ranges were calculated. Five components with 47 nursing outcomes and quality indicators for older people in Thailand were developed, including: 1) functional health and physiological status (13 indicators); 2) perception and behavior in health (6 indicators); 3) psychosocial response needs (8 indicators); 4) caregiver and family (16 indicators); and 5) satisfaction of older people, caregivers, and family (4 indicators). The findings demonstrate a need for further research to test the feasibility of the established criteria, including tests of content validity, construct validity, and instrument reliability. The outcome from the established indicators requires a high consistency. The analysis of the correlation between indicators scores obtained by the trial of indicators implementation can strengthen the validity of the indicators.","106":"Communication between physicians who order, and clinicians who provide skilled home healthcare (SHHC), is critical to well-coordinated care. The views of SHHC staff on communication with physicians have not been well studied. The objective of this study was to explore how SHHC staff view the communication processes with physicians who order SHHC services. Using purposive and snowball sampling, we conducted semistructured interviews with 22 SHHC staff across multiple regions of the United States. Qualitative thematic content analysis was used to analyze the data. SHHC staff experienced significant barriers to effective communication with physicians, including not being able to communicate in a timely manner when necessary for patient care, and challenges identifying the correct physician to coordinate care and sign SHHC orders. Key strategies to enhance communication focused on creating standardized processes to streamline communication, setting expectations for response times in communication, and improving the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Home Health Certification and Plan of Care form (commonly referred to as the \"CMS-485\"\/Plan of Care). SHHC staff experience significant communication challenges with physicians who order SHHC services that can compromise care coordination and delivery. Modifications to workflows are urgently needed to improve efficiency and quality of communication, care coordination, and quality of care.","107":"Chemotherapy is increasingly being administered in patients' homes, improving quality of life and patient comfort as well as reducing use of inpatient facilities and costs. This article describes outcomes of home chemotherapy administered by trained nurses to adult patients with solid tumors or hematological diseases. This descriptive study was conducted between February 2018 and May 2020. Variables examined included age, sex, diagnosis, routes of administration, adverse effects, tolerance, and patient satisfaction. One hundred forty-seven patients (57.14% male) with an average age of 67.8 years agreed to participate. A total of 1018 chemotherapy sessions were examined. The most common diagnoses were prostate cancer, colon cancer, and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Thirty-five percent (n = 356) of the sessions were conducted with: Azacytidine, 5-Fluoruracil, Oxaliplatin + Docetaxel + Leucovorin + Fluorouracil, and Leuprolide Acetate. The routes of administration included: intravenous (69.25%), intramuscular (13.75%), subcutaneous (15.32%), and intravesical (1.66%). Very good tolerance was reported after 87.81% of sessions and good after 8.45%. Adverse events during administration occurred in 7 sessions (0.7%); all were considered minor events. In the 24 hours following administration, 62 adverse events (6.1%) were reported, again all considered minor. All patients reported feeling just as safe as in the hospital. Our results contribute to the feasibility and safety of home chemotherapy.","108":"The goal of this interprofessional quality initiative project was to decrease emergency department (ED) visits for nonemergency health problems by referring superutilizers to home healthcare or connecting them with existing community resources. An interprofessional team of students from schools of nursing, public health, and occupational therapy collaborated on a community assessment, investigated and gathered community resources, and interviewed key stakeholders at a rural ED to identify the root causes of high utilization. Using these data, we designed an algorithm for ED clinicians that provided an organized community resource collection and electronic resources for ED staff. We focused on encouraging an increase in the evaluation of patients for eligibility to receive home healthcare services.","109":"Virtual visits, using 2-way real-time remote communication between the patient and the home health clinician, are a valuable adjunct to in-person visits to advance the prescribed plan of care.

However, little is known as to how mothers perceive participation in home visiting programs, and questions remain regarding what improvements can be made to better serve these families. The purpose of this program evaluation was to assess mothers' perceived benefits and barriers to participation in established home visiting and outreach programs at Child Developmental Resources (CDR) in Williamsburg, Virginia. The program evaluation was a descriptive project consisting of 30-minute telephone interviews. Participants included 23 English-speaking mothers enrolled in CDR programs. Maternal demographics and perception of benefits\/barriers were measured. Descriptive statistics were performed to describe sample demographics and outcome variables. Overall, most mothers perceived CDR programs as beneficial and were very satisfied with the services; however, a few changes could be made to improve programs and combat barriers to participation. Potential alternatives to supplement programs were suggested including the use of mobile technology in the participant's home.","123":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. Patients with severe COPD often fail to receive adequate palliative care and are subject to undesired hospital transfers and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although promoting advance care planning (ACP) in the community can help ensure the optimal delivery of palliative care for patients with COPD, the key challenges to routinely implementing ACP are not known. The aim of this study was to identify the perception of healthcare professionals with regard to ACP for adults living with severe COPD and the challenges to facilitating ACP. A multicenter qualitative study design was used. In-depth semistructured interviews were held involving 38 healthcare professionals from 19 institutions in Japan. Text data were analyzed by content analysis. Five main themes capturing the challenges to routine implementation of ACP were identified: daily decision-making; sense of ethical decision-making; in-depth interviewing skills; collaborative information sharing among team members; and knowledge dissemination regarding ACP. The model demonstrates the complexity inherent in ACP facilitation for community-dwelling adults with severe COPD, with all the elements required for successful ACP implementation. We recommend an approach that recognizes the importance of stakeholder education, particularly educating professionals to develop the knowledge, attitudes, and skills required for ACP facilitation: in-depth interviewing, collaborative information sharing, and ethical analysis, focusing on decision-making concerning everyday life support.","124":"The purpose of this study was to identify unmet hearing care needs among older adults receiving home healthcare as a potential method to reach a population unserved by clinic-based care. Cross-sectional analyses were used to identify hearing loss and hearing aid use among beneficiaries enrolled in home care, using data from the nationally representative 2017 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). Survey participants who reported enrollment in home healthcare services in 2017 (n = 3,183,693) were included for the purposes of analyses. Home health and hearing status were assessed through MCBS questionnaires, reported by Medicare beneficiaries or an appointed proxy, along with hearing status evaluated at initial home care intake. Among older Medicare beneficiaries receiving home healthcare, 51.8% self-reported hearing concerns. Of this population, only 16.1% reported hearing aid use. Recipients with hearing difficulty received an average of 30 visits per year, totaling to $5,208.25 in expenditure. By self-report, 44% of older home care recipients with hearing difficulty were misclassified as having \"adequate\" hearing on initial assessment and 31% of initial assessments identified hearing loss among those who self-reported no difficulty hearing. Effective management of chronic health conditions is core to healthy aging, including sensory health. Hearing loss represents a largely unaddressed need among home care recipients and frequently goes unidentified. Home-based hearing services that integrate into existing assessments and practices may be an avenue in identifying hearing loss and extending care to older adults who have traditionally gone without access to hearing intervention.","125":"The Infusion Therapy Standards of Practice provide evidence-based recommendations as published by the Infusion Nurses Society every 5 years.

Certain patient, provider, and community characteristics may influence home-hospice use. We sought to identify patient, provider, and community factors associated with home-hospice use. Our final analytic sample included 1,208,700 hospice patients who received home-hospice from 2,148 Medicare-certified hospice providers in 2016. We found that an increase in the proportion of hospice patients with a primary diagnosis of dementia decreased the odds that home-hospice was provided (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.36-1.48). Patients who received hospice care from a provider with a higher proportion of dually enrolled patients were less likely to receive home-hospice (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.36-1.48) and hospices located in ZIP-codes with higher proportion of Hispanic resident were less likely to provide home-hospice (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.99-0.99). Additional research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying these associations.","137":"The purpose of this mixed methods study was to examine comfort and emotional support that caregivers of home hospice patients derived from using electronic tablets for telehospice. The use of technology was intended to increase caregiver confidence in symptom management for individuals receiving home-based hospice care. Caregiver survey data were collected over a 2-year period. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative items. A total of 667 caregivers of home hospice patients participated. Most respondents reported being comfortable using telehospice, and as comfort levels increased, caregivers were more willing to use virtual healthcare again. Positive, negative, and neutral themes emerged from the comments by caregivers. The results of this study provide support for using telehospice with caregivers of home hospice patients. Caring for a person at the end of life is stressful and having the ability to contact a professional 24 hours a day provided comfort to the caregivers. Training is essential for caregivers to use technology and integration of technology in the care plans for all hospice patients is important for success.","138":"Frequent rehospitalizations among patients with heart failure (HF) result in patient burden and high cost. Homebound patients with HF qualify for home healthcare after hospital discharge. It is not known if nonhomebound patients with HF could also benefit from home healthcare nursing (HHN) visits to improve the transition from hospital to home. The purpose of this quality-improvement pilot study was to assess the impact of HHN visits provided to nonhomebound HF patients after hospital discharge on 30-day rehospitalization rates. We included patients with HF who were ineligible for home healthcare services due to their nonhomebound status. Home healthcare nurses followed a modified version of the discharge checklist from the American Heart Association's Rise Above Heart Failure materials, and provided education as appropriate based on patients' responses. We enrolled 68 patients in the study. The mean age was 60.2 years; 61.8% were male and 77.9% were White. Based on patient responses to the checklist, key areas addressed during HHN visits were medication management and HF self-care. In the HHN visit group, 15% of the patients experienced rehospitalization within 30 days, compared with 23% in the non-HHN visit group among 540 patients discharged in the same time frame who met the inclusion criteria but were not enrolled in the study (p = .12). Our pilot data show that HHN visits for nonhomebound patients are feasible and result in a numerically lower 30-day rehospitalization rate after discharge. Further study is needed to confirm the clinical efficacy of this approach.","139":"Understanding the experiences of home healthcare nurses and exploring the factors that influence job satisfaction is important in reducing costly staff turnover. The purpose of the qualitative case study was to describe experiences related to job satisfaction among home healthcare nurses. Herzberg's Two Factor theory was used to frame the study. Twelve home healthcare nurses from an agency in South Texas volunteered to participate in in-depth interviews. Four themes emerged from the data: 1) patients contribute to job satisfaction, 2) autonomy promotes job satisfaction, 3) occupational stressors negatively influenced job satisfaction, and 4) leadership impacts job satisfaction. Home healthcare leadership should take safety concerns seriously and explore innovative ways to promote communication between field nurses and physicians. Further research is needed with a larger and more diverse sample of home healthcare nurses in order to be able to generalize findings.","140":"The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Home-Based Primary Care program (HBPC) serves Veterans with multiple comorbid physical and psychological conditions that can increase suicide risk. HBPC teams are uniquely able to implement suicide risk assessment and prevention practices, and the team's mental health provider often trains other team members. An online suicide prevention toolkit was developed for HBPC mental health providers and their teams as part of a quality improvement project. Toolkit development was guided by a needs assessment consisting of first focus group and then data from surveys of HBPC program directors (n = 53) and HBPC mental health providers (n = 56). Needs identified by both groups included training specific to the HBPC patient population and more resources if mental health needs could not be fully managed by the HBPC team. HBPC mental health providers within integrated care teams play a key role in clinical intervention, policy development, and interprofessional team education on suicide prevention. HBPC teams have specific learning and support needs around suicide prevention that can be addressed with a feasible, easily accessible clinical and training resource.","141":"Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia in which the atria of the heart do not beat synchronously with the ventricles. It affects 2.7 to 6.1 million people in the United States. The erratic beating of the atria can cause blood clots to form in the atria, and if released into the circulation, an embolism can travel to the brain, causing a stroke. The primary goals of care for the management of atrial fibrillation are stroke-risk reduction, control of heart rate, rhythm management, and prevention of cardiac-related morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the guideline for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and provides recommendations for home healthcare clinicians.","142":"","143":"","144":"","145":"","146":"","147":"","148":"","149":"","150":"","151":"","152":"","153":"Gaining patient trust has been shown to improve health outcomes. Trust between the patient and the clinician starts with the clinician demonstrating empathy and positive attributes such as kindness and approachability. The advent of COVID-19 and the need for clinicians, patients, and caregivers to wear masks at all times has unintentionally limited nonverbal communication and potentially affected the ability of clinicians to quickly gain patients' and caregivers' trust. With so much time being spent on reeducating clinicians on infection control and donning and doffing personal protective equipment, agencies must not lose sight of the need to ensure that clinicians understand how to improve their communication skills while wearing a mask. This article provides tips on ways to use verbal and nonverbal communication to demonstrate empathy and to build trust in patient interactions to offset the difficulties wearing a mask can impose.","154":null,"155":"The purpose of this program evaluation was to determine if home visitors at the Child Development Resources (CDR) home visiting program perceived themselves to have adequate knowledge and resources to support the goals of the program. In addition, we aimed to determine what home visitors found to be facilitators and barriers to a successful program. The project was conducted with a convenience sample of 18 home visitors and included the following instruments: (a) demographics survey, (b) CDR Home Visiting Program Survey, and (c) Breastfeeding Knowledge Questionnaire. Results suggest (a) most of the home visitors believed they had adequate resources and knowledge necessary to support families and children, (b) some perceived barriers to carrying out goals of the home visiting program were financial limitations, lack of internet and mobile devices in many homes, and perception that programs were not designed for families with significant stressors such as poverty and mental health difficulties, (c) most of the home visitors believed their families benefit from their visiting programs, but many did not overwhelmingly feel new technology would greatly help families during home visits, and (d) most home visitors appeared to have adequate breastfeeding knowledge, however, some suggested that additional breastfeeding education would be beneficial. The information gathered from this project can be used to inform and improve home visiting programs seeking to enhance the quality of their programs which will ultimately contribute to better health outcomes for at-risk mothers and children.","156":"Industries that face challenges in staffing and scheduling have successfully addressed these issues through the implementation of intraday staffing automation. Home healthcare, however, introduces an additional dimension: location-specifically, efficiently scheduling the appropriate healthcare worker based on their projected location at a given time with the location of a patient who needs care. Geo-Intelligent Scheduling has the potential to effectively address the unique staffing\/scheduling challenges in home healthcare: the ability to get the right clinician to the right patient at the right location at the right time by taking into account the real-time location of the patient and clinician throughout the day. Geo-Intelligent Scheduling also has the potential to automatically create route-optimized intraday schedules for clinicians and increase effective staffing capacity by over 16% with no additional labor cost. Finally, Geo-Intelligent Scheduling can potentially improve appointment-time adherence, automate Electronic Visit Verification compliance, enhance patient\/clinician communication, and improve employee retention through self-scheduling empowerment.","157":"The author shares his philosophy for patient experience and employee engagement, using the acronym FORWARD: Find a better way; Offer a helping hand; Respect for all; Working as one; Assume positive intent; Raise the bar; and Do the right thing.

The objectives of this study were to 1) gain detailed information about the daily experiences of HHAs, 2) identify physical challenges of their work, and 3) determine if there is a role for occupational therapists (OTs) in injury prevention through education. A qualitative descriptive approach using semistructured phone interviews that were recorded and transcribed was used. Colaizzi's descriptive phenomenological method was used to guide data analysis. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling and included eight female HHAs with an age range of 35 to 65 years. The following themes were identified: HHAs valued the use of a client-centered approach with their clients (Know the rules and know your clients even better), HHAs assisted their patients with a wide range of activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living to support their independence within their home (More than Activities of Daily Living), transferring clients was considered the most physically demanding task (Would you like a hand with your transfer?), and participants believed new HHAs could benefit from training in patient positioning, appropriate use of adaptive equipment, and proper lifting mechanics in various contexts (Let's get physical!). The areas of overlap between HHAs' needs and OTs' skills provide an opportunity for OTs to consult with home care agencies as educators.","172":"The need for comprehensive palliative care is inevitable with the aging population. Incorporating home-based palliative care is a new frontier within healthcare. The purpose of this study was to embed home-based palliative care services within the visiting nursing association (VNA) at a health system in Pennsylvania, examining effect on quality of life and symptom control, and average number of hospital admission days. A convenience sample of patients with one or more chronic conditions was selected from the existing VNA census (n = 22). A series of topics were outlined for discussion at each weekly visit for the pilot length of up to 6 months, scripted by evidence-based guidelines from the ENABLE II: Charting Your Course booklet (). A pretest\/posttest survey method was conducted by utilizing results of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer. The effectiveness of the program was assessed using Spearman correlation to compare the difference in scores to the number of weeks in the program. The average number of hospital admission days during the pilot period was compared with admission days 6 months before enrollment in the pilot using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A significant relationship was found between the number of weeks in the program and reduction in the total ESAS symptom scores (rho = -0.484, p = .022), indicating that a reduction in symptoms was significantly more likely the longer a patient was in the program. Percentage of patients hospitalized decreased from 86% during preintervention period to 32% while enrolled. There was a noted reduction in the average number of days patients spent in the hospital while enrolled in the pilot (z = -2.24, p = 0.025).","173":"In the 2 decades since The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations designated pain as the fifth vital sign, practitioners have become increasingly aware of the numerous challenges associated with the assessment and management of pain in older adults. Comprehensive pain assessment relies not only on the availability of assessment tools, but also on a clinician's knowledge, training, prior experience, and keen awareness of their own implicit bias and how it may influence their assessment and decisions. The purpose of this project was to develop, implement, and evaluate outcomes of a two-part online learning module on home healthcare clinicians' knowledge of pain. A quasi-experimental, one-group pretest posttest design was used. Of the 94 clinicians who volunteered, 54 participants completed all modules and surveys. Mean posttest scores (58.7%) were significantly higher than pretest scores (50.7%; n = 54, T = 3.08, p-value = 0.003). The strongest gains in learning occurred for those with lower pretest scores. The mean difference between posttest and pretest scores did not vary among job titles. There was no significant difference in posttest scores among job titles. A higher mean pretest score was associated with greater years of clinical experience, but did not significantly affect mean posttest scores. These findings suggest elearning is an effective educational approach to improve home healthcare clinicians' pain knowledge, particularly those who lack a sufficient knowledge base at the outset.","174":"Home healthcare workers (HHCWs) belong to one of the fastest growing industries and have an unpredictable work environment, potentiating their risk of exposures to occupational hazards. More patients seeking care for chronic health conditions, and improvements in technology and medical advancements are allowing more complex patient care to be provided at home. A comprehensive integrative review was completed, identifying nine articles that provide an overview of the occupational hazards HHCWs face. Analysis of the articles indicates occupational hazards are similar across studies. Occupational exposures reported by HHCWs align within all the studies and include exposures to blood, saliva, dangerous conditions walking to and within the home, secondhand smoke, aggressive pets, violence, and ergonomic concerns. These studies have been methodologically limited to self-reports, including surveys, interviews, and focus groups but include quantitative and qualitative data. Future research can further describe and identify specific occupational exposures and health hazards, subsequently leading to modifications to protect the health and safety of HHCWs, personal care workers, and the informal caregivers who provide care in the home.","175":"","176":"","177":"","178":"","179":"","180":"","181":"","182":"","183":"","184":"","185":"","186":"","187":null,"188":"When compared with their heterosexual cisgender (nontransgender) counterparts, LGBTQ+ older adults are more likely to delay or not seek medical care, often due to fear of real or perceived discrimination from healthcare providers. HCR Home care is a home healthcare agency in Upstate New York that has been delivering high-quality in-home healthcare services for over 40 years. We recognized that we had a unique opportunity to address the vulnerabilities of older adults in the LGBTQ+ community and to better meet their health needs as they age in place. We developed a five-step process to implement a program to better serve the home healthcare needs of the LGBTQ+ population in our community. The goal of this initiative is to provide ongoing community education on home healthcare, awareness of the social and health issues surrounding LGBTQ+ older adults, and ultimately to improve care and decrease health disparities.

Because children with medical complexity (CMC) have higher healthcare needs, Latino CMC are likely to experience greater effects of these barriers. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated when Latino CMC endure adverse social conditions, such as food insecurity and housing instability. The study objective was to describe the challenges faced by caregivers of Latino CMC in meeting the practical needs of their children when caring for them at home. In this qualitative study, 70 Latino CMC enrolled in a complex care program of a tertiary care children's hospital were followed for a median duration of 45 months. We collected care coordination notes from encounter logs and interviewed bilingual care coordinators regarding their experiences with each child. Using thematic content analysis and an iterative process, we identified recurrent themes related to practical needs. Four themes emerged. Caregivers: 1) faced financial challenges due to many reasons that were exacerbated by children's medical conditions; 2) had challenges meeting basic needs of their families, including food and shelter; 3) experienced difficulties obtaining necessary medical supplies for their children; and 4) relied on care coordinators to navigate the system. We conclude that Latino caregivers of CMC experience many challenges meeting their families' basic needs and obtaining necessary medical supplies to care for their CMC at home. Care coordinators play a major role in addressing the practical needs of Latino CMC. Future studies should determine whether addressing the practical needs of Latino CMC would improve their health outcomes.","190":"The threat of workplace violence (WPV) is a significant occupational hazard for home healthcare workers (HHCWs).

The methodology used was the integrative review by , which allows for inclusion of experimental and non-experimental research, reflecting the state of the science on interventions used by HHCWs to mitigate and prevent WPV. A total of 17 articles pertained to interventions used by HHCWs. Interventions were further categorized by WPV Type. There are a number of interventions used for Type I and II WPV. However, interventions for Type III WPV are minimal and interventions for Type IV WPV are obsolete. Safety and health training were shown to be significant in increasing HHCWs' confidence and knowledge about WPV prevention. Researchers demonstrated safety and health training are effective in promoting a safe work environment and reducing incidents of WPV. This review begins to fill the gap in the literature on interventions used by HHCWs to mitigate and prevent WPV.","191":"Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection that affects over 1.7 million people annually in the United States. Although sepsis can strike healthy and active people of all ages, those at highest risk are older adults, infants, and people with chronic illnesses or an impaired immune system. Many people who had sepsis recover and resume life as it was before. However, others require some level of postdischarge home healthcare. Up to 60% of survivors, particularly of severe sepsis and septic shock, are left with cognitive and\/or physical limitations. About one-third of all sepsis survivors and more than 40% of older survivors are rehospitalized within 3 months of the initial sepsis diagnosis, most commonly due to a repeat episode of sepsis or another infection. Quality home healthcare follow-up of sepsis patients is paramount in lowering readmission rates, preventing reoccurrence of sepsis, and assisting patients and families during the postsepsis phase of healthcare.","192":"","193":"","194":"","195":"","196":"","197":"","198":"","199":"","200":"","201":"","202":"","203":"Social inclusion and social determinants of health (SDH) are key to healthy aging, and a failure to adequately address these influences can lead to negative health consequences such as the development and worsening of chronic conditions.

Pharmacological pain management is common, but all drugs bring some risk of side effects and adverse reactions. The opioid epidemic has brought into question analgesic prescribing patterns across all care settings. This study, which used data collected between 2012 and 2014, examines the pain medications used by older adults with activity-limiting pain receiving home care physical therapy in a large metropolitan home care agency. Eighty-five percent of subjects took at least one analgesic medication on admission to home care, and of these, 51.3% were using an opioid, 33.1% used acetaminophen, and 23.2% used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). At the 60-day follow-up, the most common medication classes taken by participants included acetaminophen (38%), opioids (35.9%), and NSAIDs (31.6%). We found racial\/ethnic differences in analgesic use at baseline but not at follow-up. At baseline, analgesic use differed by pain type, but there were no differences at follow-up. The high use of medications to control pain by patients receiving home care, particularly opioid use, underscores the importance of providers being alert to potential adverse drug reactions.","205":"Despite a growing population of children with medical complexity, little is known about the current quality of pediatric home healthcare. The objective of this study was to characterize the quality of pediatric home healthcare experienced by primary family caregivers (parents) and healthcare providers of children with medical complexity. Semistructured, in-depth key informant interviews of 20 caregivers and 20 providers were conducted and analyzed for factors affecting home healthcare quality using the Institute of Medicine's quality framework (effective, safe, patient-centered, timely, equitable, and efficient). System complexity, insurance denials, and workforce shortages affected patients' ability to establish and maintain access to home healthcare leading to hospital discharge delays and negative family impacts. When home healthcare was accessible, respondents experienced it as effective in improving patient and family daily life and minimizing use of emergency and hospital services. However, respondents identified a need for more pediatric-specific home healthcare training and increased efficiencies in care plan communication. Overall, home healthcare was not perceived as timely or equitable due to access barriers. This study provides a new conceptual framework representing the relationship between home healthcare quality and outcomes for children with medical complexity for future evaluations of quality improvement, research, and policy initiatives.","206":"Sepsis results in 270,000 deaths annually in the United States. Despite the current healthcare focus on sepsis, there exist few postacute best-practice standards to rapidly identify health changes in home healthcare patients to prevent and reduce hospital readmissions due to sepsis. We systematically examined whether an evidence-based process and intervention triggering home healthcare clinicians to activate a Positive Sepsis Assessment would reduce the likelihood that the patient would be readmitted to the acute care hospital. Over 24 months, we tracked the rate of sepsis readmissions to acute care hospitals through the initial phase of early recognition education; assessment, review, and revision of best-practice algorithms; standardized documentation; and proactive care management, in conjunction with the patient's primary care provider. During our review of the last 12 months of data on home care patients triggering the Positive Sepsis Assessment 130 patients were identified to have potential signs of sepsis. Ninety-seven of these patients received early medical intervention in place and were not readmitted to the hospital. Our findings suggest that a multidisciplinary home healthcare team utilizing standard sepsis education and sepsis algorithm on every patient during every visit can reduce and prevent readmissions.","207":"Suicide among most age groups has been on the rise in the United States for the past 20 years.

Self-reported fall outcomes, healthcare utilization outcomes, perceptions of interventions, and financial perceptions were descriptively analyzed. There were 18 survey respondents (9 male, 9 female, mean age = 79 years). No falls were reported by 15 respondents and 3 reported 1 to 2 falls without injury. Seventeen participants reported no hospitalizations, one reported only overnight emergency room observation, and no participants reported requiring physical therapy. Participants reported benefits of: activity trackers (18\/18), fall-prevention exercises (17\/18), and electronic blood pressure monitor use (13\/18). Despite reported benefits, participants indicated an inability\/unwillingness to privately pay for the program with fixed incomes identified as the rationale for this response.

Approximately 20% of patients who are discharged from the hospital following an exacerbation of COPD are readmitted within 30 days. At a home healthcare agency in southeastern United States, 36.4% of patients admitted to the agency with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COPD between August 2018 and January 2019 were rehospitalized within 30 days of admission. A quality improvement project was conducted between January 2019 and July 2019. This project involved implementation of a COPD self-management care plan packet provided by home healthcare nurses to patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COPD. The 30-day rehospitalizations for patients with COPD decreased from 36.4% preintervention to 15.4% postintervention. The number of patients receiving timely follow-up with their provider increased from 79% preintervention to 88% postintervention, and COPD medication reconciliation at admission improved from 79% preintervention to 84% postintervention. The generalizability of these results is limited due to a small sample size and inconsistencies in intervention implementation.","221":"Pediatric Home Service (PHS) in Roseville, Minnesota, has provided home care for children with medical complexity for over 30 years.

We assessed preadmission activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, health literacy, numeracy, and cognition. Postdischarge phone calls identified medication errors and medication reconciliation efforts by home healthcare clinicians. Veterans Administration-based community health nurses completed surveys about content and timing of postdischarge interactions with home healthcare clinicians. We determined the types and frequency of medication errors among older Veterans receiving home healthcare, patient-provider communication patterns in this setting, and patient characteristics affecting medication error rates. Most Veterans (24\/30, 80%) had at least one discordant medication, and only one noted that errors were identified and resolved. Veterans were asked about medications in the home healthcare setting, but far fewer were questioned about medication-taking details, adherence, and as-needed or nonoral medications. Higher numeracy was associated with fewer errors. Veterans Administration community health nurses reported contact by home healthcare clinicians in 41% of cases (7\/17). Given the high rate of medication errors discovered, future work should focus on implementing best practices for medication review in this setting, as well as documenting barriers\/facilitators of patient-provider communication.","235":"Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of rehospitalization in the United States. Due to the complex nature of HF, the provision of Medicare-certified home healthcare services has increased. Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies measure and report patients' outcomes such as functional status, activities of daily living (ADL), and instrumental activities of daily living to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These metrics are assessed using the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). As a large data set, OASIS has been used to advance care quality in multiple ways including identifying risk factors for negative patient outcomes. However, there is a lack of OASIS analyses to assess the relationship between functional status and the role of other factors, such as pain, in impeding recovery after hospitalization among HF patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between functional status and pain using the OASIS database. Among 489 HF patients admitted to home healthcare, 83% were White, 57% were female, and the median age was 80. Patients who reported daily but not constant activity-interfering pain at discharge demonstrated the least improvement in functional performance as measured by ADLs, whereas patients without activity-interfering pain demonstrated the greatest improvement in ADL performance (p value = 0.0284). Tracking individual patient ADL scores, particularly the frequency of activity-interfering pain, could be a key indicator for clinical focus for patients with HF in the home healthcare setting.","236":"Adjusting to life with a new ostomy is a daunting prospect for many patients. Without proper education, complications can occur, some requiring hospital readmission. Many home healthcare nurses also face the challenge of training new ostomy patients in self-care. The purpose of this quality improvement pilot study was to improve outcomes in a sample of new ostomy patients by implementing an intervention consisting of nurse and patient education. The study was conducted at a Southern California home healthcare agency with an average patient census of 270. The participants were 30 home healthcare nurses (6 licensed vocational nurses and 24 registered nurses). We followed the outcomes of four home healthcare patients with new ostomies. The nurse ostomy education session included both didactic and hands-on components to promote practice change. Patient education was guided by the use of an evidence-based ostomy skills checklist adapted from the Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses Society's ostomy discharge criteria. Nurse's skills and competence were measured and compared via results from a 10-question pre- and postintervention nurse self-assessment survey. Patient outcomes were measured and compared via pre- and postintervention chart reviews examining three factors: number of weeks on service, number of visits to reach independence, and number of unscheduled visits. Statistical analysis of survey data showed a significant change in the scores for all questions, indicating the nurses felt more confident managing ostomies after the education session. After the intervention, the number of weeks patients were on service for a new ostomy diagnosis decreased by an average of 1.5 weeks; patients required 50% fewer visits to reach independence; and unscheduled visits decreased by 500%.","237":"The purpose of this article is to describe current evidence-based strategies to manage severe pain in patients living with terminal illnesses. A comprehensive pain assessment is a critical step in the initial development of a pain management plan and for ongoing evaluation of patients' pain.

Although these policies may reduce opioid prescribing, there has been an unintended consequence for patients with severe cancer pain. Opioids are foundational for cancer pain management and are often required for patients during end-of-life care. Shortages of some opioid medications require knowledge of equianalgesic dosing. Equianalgesia is the conversion of comparable pain-relieving effects from one medication to another. There is a lack of consensus with regard to conversion standardization so researchers have created dosing principles that clinicians can follow.

The purpose of this retrospective, quantitative study was to determine the differences in hospital readmission between Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White patients with HF who either received or did not receive home telemonitoring services from a home care agency in Connecticut. A purposive sample of 138 records of patients admitted between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2017, with a diagnosis of HF provided the data for the study. Data were analyzed by conducting simple and multiple logistic regression analyses. The key findings showed that Hispanics who used telemonitoring were almost four times less likely to be readmitted to the hospital compared with Hispanics who did not use telemonitoring (p = .04). Race, age, gender, and insurance were not significant predictors of readmissions (p &gt; .05). The findings from this study may provide healthcare providers with a better understanding of the outcomes of home telemonitoring for treating adult Hispanic patients with HF.","251":"Only 2.3% of patients at a Midwest home healthcare (HH) agency had documented advance directives (ADs), compared with 28% nationally. Of concern, this HH agency lacked standardized procedures for advance care planning (ACP) leading to inadequate staff knowledge regarding end-of-life, avoidable hospital readmissions, and delayed transitions into hospice care. Lack of ADs is directly correlated to higher hospital readmission rates and lower hospice length of stay. The purpose of this initiative was to develop evidence-based procedures using the Respecting Choices ACP model to: 1) educate staff, 2) increase ACP conversations offered and completed among high-risk patients, 3) increase Practitioner Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) rates, 4) reduce 60-day hospital readmissions, and 5) support hospice care admissions. Staff received discipline-specific education on ACP\/ADs. The Knowledge-Attitudinal-Experiential Survey on Advance Directives (KAESAD), assessed staff ACP\/AD knowledge, confidence, and experiences. Standardized electronic medical record tools were created to track ACP conversations, POLST rates, 60-day hospital readmissions, and hospice admissions. Paired t-test and chi-square analyses compared changes pre- and post implementation. The KAESAD survey was analyzed for 75 staff (100%) and demonstrates improvement in knowledge, confidence, and experiences. Data also demonstrate increases in: ACP offered 6% to 80% (p &lt; .001); ACP conversations completed 4% to 31% (p &lt; .001); POLST rates 26% to 43.6% (p = .059); decreased 60-day hospital readmissions 40% to 20% (p = .025); whereas hospice care admissions was not impacted ranging from 10% to 5.5% (p = .381). Respecting Choices serves as an effective ACP framework to improve ACP conversations, POLST rates, and hospital readmissions.","252":"Technology systems to alleviate the burden of caregiving are increasing in use. The home is a unique place where chronic disease management is often performed by informal caregivers, yet how caregivers make decisions about adopting a specific technology has not been thoroughly explored. This systematic scoping review mapped evidence on decision-making factors associated with technology adoption and use by caregivers of patients receiving care at home. We followed the recommendations developed by members of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched using both medical subject headings (MeSH terms) and key words. A total of six papers were included for data synthesis. Factors such as information, comprehension, motivation, time, perceived burden, and perceived caregiving competency were found to affect adoption of technology. There are other factors uniquely springing from the patient and technology, as well as shared issues between caregivers and patient, and caregivers and technology. Although some factors depend on technology type and patient diagnosis, there were some common factors across the research. Those factors can be carefully considered in referring technology use for caregivers. More focused study in this underinvestigated area is much needed.","253":"Aging is associated with comorbidities and increased utilization of healthcare services, which results in a large amount of personal health information (PHI) to manage. Older adults often have difficulty managing this increased load of health information. Although many home healthcare nurses (HCNs) provide assistance to older adults after discharge from medical facilities, little is known about HCNs' experiences with older adults regarding the management and transfer of PHI in their homes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to 1) determine how HCNs obtain and provide health information, 2) describe the perspective of HCNs regarding older adult PHI, and 3) identify the potential role of technology in older adult health information transfer. We conducted and analyzed semistructured phone interviews with 17 HCNs from two home healthcare agencies. Five thematic areas emerged from interviews with HCNs: 1) common practices of obtaining health information; 2) barriers to obtaining health information; 3) ideal ways to obtain and provide health information; 4) use of patient portals; and 5) HCNs' use of technology for health information exchange. Most HCNs reported that it would be difficult for older adult patients to update their PHI without assistance, but HCNs lack the time and resources to assist older adults in PHI management activities.","254":"Heart failure (HF) is a significant public health problem that is projected to increase in prevalence in the next 20 years due to a growing aged population and improved survival after acute cardiac events. The American College of Cardiology (2019) defines HF as a complex clinical syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill or eject blood. In systolic HF, the left ventricular muscle has diminished contractility and ejection fraction is less than 40%. This article will review the pathophysiology and treatment of HF.

Although the establishment of this clinic represented progress in meeting many healthcare needs of the target population, an interprofessional team also identified a need for the initiation of a new home-based service line. The goal of this project was to establish an innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective healthcare delivery method that would improve the health of this population. The project focused on a literature review, needs-assessment, and development of a comprehensive medical home visit program to serve the homebound, frail elderly, and other at-risk adults with complex medical conditions who reside in this community. The medical needs of potential recipients were assessed by conducting interviews with key support staff including a health service coordinator, health advocates, and housing provider service coordinators. Residents were also interviewed using a newly developed health perception and information survey. The data derived from the needs-assessment and pertinent literature were used to draft an initial program guideline. Because the needs-assessment indicated this population would not derive maximum benefit from a traditional house calls program, the project team developed a Home Healthcare Management service with an expanded scope to provide enhanced care coordination, house visits (medical and nonmedical), and community outreach.","266":"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a highly prevalent infection in the United States. One complication of HSV is HSV keratitis, an ocular HSV infection thought to be the leading cause of corneal blindness in the United States. Home care clinicians with knowledge of the signs and symptoms of HSV and HSV keratitis can aid in early detection and treatment of this potentially serious infection. This article discusses signs and symptoms of HSV keratitis, preventive measures, and treatment.","267":"Family caregivers can benefit from education-based wellness programs, but many face barriers to attending such programs. The purpose of this research was to explore telehealth as a delivery format for an education-based caregiver wellness program. This qualitative research examined the caregiver experience of a specific program called Powerful Tools for Caregivers (PTC). The traditionally in-person program was delivered via telehealth in four states. Twelve caregivers participated in focus groups the week after completing the telehealth PTC program. Three major themes emerged from the focus groups: Knowledge Gained, Interrelatedness, and Technology Pros and Cons. All affirmed a positive experience of the telehealth delivered PTC program. Participants expressed gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the program and knowledge gained including relaxation techniques, communication skills, resources to support caregiving, and goal setting for self-care. Furthermore, participants were appreciative of the opportunity to connect with other caregivers from the comfort of their home.","268":null,"269":"Home healthcare plays an increasingly vital role in contemporary postacute healthcare. Staffing instability and lack of perceived organizational support is a stimulus for nursing attrition from the organization with far-reaching impact on staff morale, patient care, agency budgets, and relationships with other healthcare settings. The purpose of this article is to describe a redesign of an agency's nursing orientation and the development of a mentorship program for newly hired home healthcare nurses within a large Midwestern integrated health system. During this time frame, 154 nurses completed the newly designed orientation program and, of those, 91 participated in the mentorship program. In this article, we evaluate 1-year new-hire nursing retention rates over a 4-year period, examine new-hire job satisfaction and perceptions of preceptors and mentors during their first year, and discuss issues of outcome sustainability. Agency-wide turnover rates for all home healthcare nurses decreased from 15.4% in 2016 to 10.1% in 2018, demonstrating the associated impact of these initiatives on staffing stabilization.","270":"This article focuses on the care and management of patients living with a urostomy. Improved surgical techniques and shortened hospital stays result in more patients receiving home care in the immediate postoperative period after surgical creation of a urostomy. It is important that home care clinicians have the knowledge and skills to manage the care of patients with a urostomy from hospital discharge to self-care. This article reviews the anatomy and physiology of the urinary tract, the formation of a stoma, and indications for the creation of a urostomy. Stent management, peristomal skin care, stomal complications as well as pouching options and accessories are discussed. Knowledge of care of patients with a urostomy can reduce the risk of complications and hospital readmissions, and assist patients to adjust to life with a urostomy.","271":"","272":"","273":"","274":"","275":"","276":"","277":"","278":"","279":"","280":"","281":"The use of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) to improve patient outcomes, communication, and shared decision-making is of significance to home healthcare. Clinicians have begun to integrate health information technology (HIT) enabled PROM platforms (such as tablets) into routine care to facilitate collection of PROMs. To evaluate the feasibility and suitability of incorporating PROMs into the overall workflow in home healthcare, and integrating data collected with electronic health records (EHRs), we engaged two home healthcare agencies as pilot sites over the course of 4 months. We provided tablets enabled with an app version of the validated Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System to collect patient data. This was followed by surveys, interviews, and observations on aspects of feasibility, which we analyzed using summary statistics and qualitative analysis. Results show that the implementation of the HIT-enabled PROMs in the home healthcare setting is suitable for workflow, without negatively impacting goals of care. Additionally, the tablets were considered user-friendly by both clinicians and patients. Key to the utility of HIT-enabled PROMs in home healthcare is the integration of the data collected with existing data systems, in order to facilitate quality and improve outcomes, the success of which can depend on EHR platform ownership and the related ability or access to modify EHRs.","282":"A large sample of all 2011 home healthcare users in traditional Medicare was analyzed to identify the risk indicators at start-of-care that were associated with the highest probability of readmission (N = 597,493). Thirty-five patient characteristics found in Outcome and Assessment Information Set, claims history, or other administrative data were associated with a 30-day readmission risk 30% to 100% above the average in the sample. Most of these characteristics were associated with a 30-day readmission probability of approximately 1 in 5, and several were associated with a readmission probability approaching 1 in 10 during the first 7 days. A majority of the high-risk characteristics were uncommon, and they tended not to occur together, suggesting they can be useful flags for clinicians in prioritizing cases to reduce readmissions. Readmission risk grows most quickly early in the episode of care; typically one-third of the readmissions in the first 30 days occurred by the end of 7 days. High-risk markers at 7 and 30 days were substantially the same, illustrating the importance of the early days at home in influencing the 30-day outcome. A variety of domains and characteristics are represented among the highest-risk markers, suggesting challenges to home healthcare clinicians in maintaining the knowledge and skills needed to address readmission prevention. We suggest possible responses to this problem as strategies to consider, and also discuss implications for assessment practices in home healthcare.","283":"In 2010, the Institute of Medicine published the vision for how to transform healthcare to achieve a more seamless patient-centered, high-quality system of care. Among the recommendations were four specifically focused on leveraging nursing which is the largest group of healthcare workers: (1) Ensure that nurses can practice to the full extent of their education and training, (2) Improve nursing education, (3) Provide opportunities for nurses to assume leadership positions and to serve as full partners in healthcare redesign and improvement efforts, and (4) Improve data collection for workforce planning and policy making. At the Care New England Health Care System's Visiting Nurse Association, located in the state of Rhode Island, we redesigned access to end-of-life care by leveraging these recommendations. An experienced palliative care nurse practitioner (NP) leads the program development to improve care delivered by home healthcare nurses and NP specialists. This program was designed to allow patients to remain in their preferred setting of care-their home-until the end of their life. In the 5 years of this program's existence, it has achieved a yearly impact on community-based palliative care and hospice services. The number of documented advance directives increased by 75%, referrals to palliative care and hospice increased by 300% and the length of time on hospice doubled. In addition, NP home visits became an accepted referral source and improvements in both the quality and satisfaction scores for the home healthcare agency were realized.","284":"Transitions of care between settings and clinicians are a time of vulnerability for patients, and can result in fragmented care, medication errors, avoidable readmissions, and patient\/nurse dissatisfaction. Through the use of technology and a structured face-to-face handoff, the patient and family can be engaged in the transition across settings. The purpose of this project was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of videoconference handoffs between inpatient, case management, and home care nurses, and the patients\/families during transitions of care from hospital to home care. Videoconferences were conducted for 2 months with patients transitioning from two pediatric inpatient units to the hospital-based home care agency. The nurses and patient\/family connected through a secure cloud-based videoconferencing platform. Participants discussed the patient's status, safety concerns, ongoing plan of care, what the patient\/family could expect at home, and the coordination of equipment\/supply needs and postdischarge visits. Videoconference handoffs (n = 10) were found to be feasible and address gaps in communication, coordination of care, and patient\/family engagement during transitions from hospital to home care. Postpilot, nurses agreed the videoconference handoffs should continue with minimal modifications.","285":"The prevalence of chronic heart failure is increasing in the United States due to the increase in the number of older adults and because many people are surviving acute cardiac events and living longer with chronic heart disease. In end-stage heart failure, heart transplant was once the gold standard of treatment and patients had to wait for a matching heart donor. In the past, the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was a mechanical circulatory support treatment used temporarily for those awaiting heart transplant. However, the LVAD is increasingly becoming the chosen treatment of patients in lieu of heart transplant. Home healthcare nurses and clinicians need to be familiar with LVADs in order to care for patients in end-stage heart failure who are using these devices. This article explains the mechanism, potential complications, and nursing implications of caring for the patient who is using an LVAD.","286":"","287":"","288":"","289":"","290":"","291":"","292":"","293":"","294":"","295":"Activities of daily living (ADLs) is an important measure of the quality of care provided in home healthcare (HHC), but few studies describe the ADLs of HHC patients. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the types and levels of ADL dependency among patients receiving home care, (2) identify the risk factors for severe ADL dependency at admission, and (3) identify the predictors of ADL improvement during an HHC stay. This was a secondary data analysis of a 5% random sample (n = 105,654) of the national Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS-C) for the year 2013. The dependent variables were severe ADL dependency level at admission and ADL improvement from admission to discharge. About two thirds (65%) of the patients (n = 99,991) had severe ADL dependency (dependence in seven or more ADLs) at admission. Older age, female gender, and impaired decision-making were associated with severe ADL dependency on admission. Of the 105,654 patients, 58.1% (n = 89,997) experienced ADL improvement. ADL improvement was associated with increasing HHC length of stay, being female, and prior inpatient stay. Clinicians, policy makers, and agencies could focus on modifiable characteristics to achieve the goal of ADL improvement.","296":"","297":"Approximately one in four to five patients discharged from the hospital is rehospitalized within 30 days. Through the Grotta Fund for Senior Care, we implemented a program to address rehospitalizations among patients with chronic conditions including congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes mellitus. Patients were introduced to telehealth by a transitions coach while still in the inpatient setting. Patients received three coaching visits, daily monitoring of vital signs, and daily monitoring for signs\/symptoms of exacerbation. Patients were educated on disease-specific red flags, participated in role playing, and received two visits with a dietitian who went grocery shopping with them. The 30-day rehospitalization rate for patients participating in the program (n = 102) was 7.8%. The number of hospitalizations in the 90 days prior to the program totaled 126. This was compared with 36 hospitalizations in the 90 days after admission to the program. The Wilcoxon T+ test shows there is a statistically significant difference in the number of hospitalizations (p &lt; .0001). Giving chronically ill patients the tools and support to become independent in their care was shown to decrease hospitalizations.","298":"The purpose of this study was to determine if the timing of home care visits post hospitalization for heart failure influenced hospital readmission rates. Using a randomized control study design, hospital readmission data were collected from 67 recently discharged patients with heart failure. The control group (n = 32) received the usual care, whereas the intervention group (n = 35) received an altered scheduling of home care visits. Seven study participants were readmitted during the study time frame (control group n = 3; intervention group n = 4). Emergency room visits occurred three times (control group n = 1; intervention group n = 2). The timing of the home healthcare visit did not affect hospital readmission. Adherence to weight monitoring, fluid restriction, and medication administration improved with the home care visits. Greater attention to these activities should be the focus of home healthcare visits as they may decrease hospital readmissions.","299":"The purpose of the Triple Aim is to improve population health, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the patient experience. These goals-to reduce cost while improving health outcomes and patient experiences have shifted utilization of services from other postacute care settings to the home. The purpose of this perspective article is to discuss how home healthcare services, and home physical therapy (PT) specifically, provide value to patients, caregivers, and payers to meet the goals of the Triple Aim. This article will substantiate the value of home PT and provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based information on the value of home PT.","300":"This article focuses on the care and management of patients living with an ileostomy. Due to shortened hospital stays, patient teaching related to self-care of ostomies has shifted from the hospital to the home setting. It is important for home care clinicians to be knowledgeable about all aspects of ostomy care. Patients with ileostomies are particularly prone to peristomal skin problems, as well as fluid and electrolyte and nutritional imbalances.

Although it is acknowledged that pets can provide positive health benefits to owners, the focus is on the responsibility of the pet owners to secure pets when clinicians visit in order to keep the clinician and patient safe during the home visit. A proposed Pet Policy Agreement is presented whereby the pet owner as patient bears some responsibility for ensuring the safety of home healthcare clinicians.","312":"Safe disposal of expired or unused medications is essential for individual and environmental safety, yet many patients report not having received education on proper medication disposal. Unused medications in homes and improper medication disposal create various risks including intentional or accidental misuse, overdose, addiction in humans, as well as toxic effects in pets. As part of their community health clinical experience, senior nursing students from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing visited patients of a large home care and hospice agency in a Philadelphia suburb throughout the semester. A survey conducted with a small number (N = 15) of home care patients suggested the majority of patients had inadequate knowledge about safe medication disposal. The nursing students created and presented a tip sheet on safe medication disposal and a list of local prescription medication disposal sites to home care patients. They also obtained and provided medication disposal bags for patients and caregivers who were unable to get to medication disposal sites.","313":"Traditional home healthcare reimbursement models emphasize intervention after a medical or functional issue occurs, and there is little evidence of preventative home-based physical therapy services for those at highest risk of becoming homebound due to illness, injury, or functional limitation. The purpose of this study was to describe the development and initial pilot results of the Home-based Older Person Upstreaming Prevention Physical Therapy (HOP-UP-PT) Program. The prospective observational pilot study included five participants referred from a community center. The HOP-UP-PT Program utilized fall risk, functional, environmental, cognitive, and health-related assessments. Two males and three females aged 73 to 92 years were enrolled. Outcomes suggest that health, functional, and environmental benefits may be achieved when an older person participates in the HOP-UP-PT Program. Safety and health benefits gained by two individuals referred to the program, but who did not meet inclusion criteria, are also reported. Evidence emerging from this pilot study suggests trends toward improved functional outcomes associated with reduced fall risk and customized home-based safety recommendations among older adults participating in the HOP-UP-PT Program.","314":"Evidence-based practice (EBP) is becoming standard in today's healthcare arena and home care organizations are not exempt from integrating evidence into practice to improve patient outcomes. There is a scarcity of research literature that examines the behaviors and attitudes of home healthcare nurses (HHNs) regarding EBP. In this study, a descriptive survey design was used to investigate HHNs' a) information-seeking behaviors when providing nursing care, b) administrative support for EBP (as perceived by HHNs), c) attitudes toward EBP, and d) EBP engagement and confidence in providing EBP nursing care. Self-reported data were collected by internet and paper survey. The survey consisted of a 65-item questionnaire that included the Nurses' Attitudes Toward Evidence-Based Practice Scale, which has previously established validity and reliability. A convenience sample of 95 HHNs participated in the study. Results suggest HHNs' EBP attitudes are positive. A positive and significant relationship was found between attitudes and hours worked (r = 0.21, p = 0.047) and educational level (r = 0.45, p = 0.0001); 95% confidence level. Confidence levels in providing EBP care were moderate, and HHNs did not perceive EBP as an agency priority. HHNs need to be supported and encouraged in the facilitation of EBP, a task made easier when they are knowledgeable about EBP, have confidence in their EBP skills, and have the support of their organizations.","315":"Surgical creation of a colostomy can have significant physical, emotional, and social effects. Adapting to a new ostomy can be overwhelming and interventions aimed at decreasing barriers to self-care should be a priority for home care patients. Advances in surgical procedures, coupled with decreased length of hospital stays, require home care clinicians to have the skills and knowledge to care for this population through postoperative recovery and the initial phases of learning self-care. This article will focus on the care of patients with a colostomy in the home care setting.","316":"","317":"Perceptions of risks in decision making for home healthcare were examined. Twenty home healthcare professionals were interviewed. Content analysis yielded one theme (management of known and unpredictable risks) and four categories. Healthcare professionals had to handle both known and unpredictable risks in daily work in patients' homes concerning communication challenges, a fragmented organization at several levels, risky medication management, and balancing respect for patient autonomy and involvement in care against risk taking. Priority must be given to creating safer care in this setting.","318":"","319":"","320":"","321":"","322":"","323":"","324":"","325":"","326":"The ability to maintain functional status is an essential aspect of self-care for older adults. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) decline within hours of hospitalization and are often overlooked, underassessed, and underreported. The aim of this integrative review was to examine and compare methods used to assess IADLs to determine the best measure for use across the care continuum, especially during transitions of care. A literature search without date restrictions was conducted using PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Embase databases. Twelve studies of moderate quality were included in this review. More than half (58%) of the studies utilized the Lawton and Brody Scale to measure IADL among home-based and hospitalized patients. Implementation of this scale as standard practice and sharing the results with healthcare providers would encourage continuity of care with the goal of supporting older adults aging in place and preventing rehospitalization. In turn, this communication process may improve the transition from the inpatient to home setting, where, since 1999, the Outcome and Assessment Information Set has been mandated.","327":"Over nine million people living in the United States are military Veterans over the age of 65. Many utilize civilian care providers, creating a need for civilian providers to have an understanding of the unique healthcare issues of this population. This article describes the qualitative results of a mixed-methods study of nine home care nurses' experiences caring for Veterans. Three themes emerged from the data: Challenges Coordinating Care, Building a Rapport Takes More Time, and Recognizing Impact of Military Service on Patient's Worldview. As demonstrated in this study, home care nurses care for Veterans every day. Although similarities exist, nurses readily described differences in caring for Veterans compared with non-Veterans that can impact patient outcomes. It is imperative for the nursing workforce to not only assess for military\/Veteran status but to also have some knowledge of military culture and Veteran-specific healthcare issues.","328":"Nurses report significant gaps in communication among patients discharged from the hospital with home healthcare (HHC) services. The aim of this pilot study was to quantify the contents of HHC admission packets used to guide nurses' first home visit after hospital discharge. We evaluated 20 randomly selected charts of older adults admitted to HHC after a hospitalization for heart failure. Admission packets contained nearly 50 pages of material, which frequently included duplicate documents printed from the hospital-based electronic health record (EHR). Despite the plethora of documents, most packets omitted key information, such as patients' cognitive and functional status, and even discharge summaries, which would be relevant and actionable for HHC nurses. Moreover, admission packets contained multiple, often discordant, EHR-generated medication lists, which makes reconciliation challenging for nurses and puts vulnerable patients at risk for adverse drug events. Overall, there is an urgent need to improve health information exchange between hospitals and HHC agencies, which will simultaneously promote nurse efficiency and patient safety.","329":"STROKE is sudden and often traumatic with results that affect both the patient and family members who provide care. Approximately 40% of individuals caring for family members\/friends are male. Transitioning from the noncaregiver role to caregiver can be unsettling. Guided by Friedemann's framework of systemic organization, this secondary data analysis examined problems reported by men caring for spouses in the first year after stroke. Using a mixed methods design, 73 caregivers (CGs) participated in bimonthly telephone interviews for 1 year. For this analysis, only the males caring for spouses (n = 12 married and n = 1 unmarried partner) were examined. These data were analyzed using Colaizzi's rigorous method of content analysis. Five problem themes emerged: 1) adjusting to multitasking in everyday living (Friedemann's system maintenance and individuation), 2) recognizing physical and mental disabilities (coherence), 3) dealing with outside forces and limited resources (individuation), 4) struggling to return to normal (system maintenance), and 5) feeling physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted (system maintenance). These problem themes demonstrated incongruence as the men sought to maintain their prior lives.Theory-based themes of male stroke CGs' problems were uncovered that can be used to target interventions to help them achieve balance between incongruence and congruence in their lives.","330":null,"331":"Chronic conditions and age-related changes place older adults at increased risk for skin breakdown and damage to skin integrity, leading to poor outcomes that may impact quality of life. Although we cannot stop skin from aging, home care clinicians are in the best position to mitigate further skin problems and influence healthier outcomes for patients with skin issues. Home healthcare clinicians can improve skin health and well-being for older adults by incorporating simple but thorough systematic skin assessments at every visit. This includes identifying the patient's personal skin care practices and preferences. Home healthcare clinicians can intervene and address excessive moisture or extreme dryness of skin, use available resources for best practices in wound care, and educate about sun protection.","332":"","333":"","334":"","335":"","336":"","337":"","338":"","339":"","340":"Patients with dementia have unique safety needs due to cognitive and behavioral changes associated with dementia. Because the prevalence of dementia is expected to greatly increase with an aging population, and because an estimated 70% of people with dementia live at home, it is essential that healthcare providers receive adequate training on the special needs of this population. This article will discuss home safety interventions with regard to: 1) risk of falling, 2) kitchen use and food safety, 3) medication safety, and 4) wandering and personal safety. A successful health program must include ongoing evaluation of the patient's risk profile with regard to health issues, physical and cognitive deficits, medications, and physical environment. Risks can be accepted, addressed, or actively remediated as appropriate. Good interventions should promote acceptable patient behavior and engage assistive personnel to achieve the desired outcome. To promote safety, the home environment can be modified to encourage positive behaviors and to discourage potentially harmful behaviors. Communication between the patient, trained healthcare providers, and family caregivers is essential.","341":"One of the greatest challenges for healthcare systems is the management and prevention of chronic diseases. Wagner's Chronic Care Model aims to transform the daily care of patients with chronic illnesses from acute and reactive to proactive, planned, and population-based. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the available research relating to the Chronic Care Model and consider the implications for Home Care Case Management practice. A total of 18 research studies (5 qualitative and 13 quantitative) were reviewed. A thematic content analysis approach was used. The findings included three themes: Chronic Care Model and positive chronic illness health behaviors and outcomes; Chronic Care Model and delivery of quality chronic illness care; and the importance of the supportive role of the home care nurse in the role of Home Care Case Management. Gaps and limitations of the Chronic Care Model in relation to Home Care Case Management were identified and discussed in relationship to partnership building and reciprocal trust between patients, family caregivers, and the Home Care Case Manager. Finally, implications for the use of the Chronic Care Model in Home Care Case Manager practice, policy development, and future research were presented.","342":"Occupational therapy (OT) services provided in the home to a person with dementia can decrease caregiver burden by targeting home modifications, functional performance, and safety. One method to deliver these services is through telehealth. The use of telehealth is expanding rapidly, but there is a current lack of evidence to support the use of telehealth to deliver OT services to persons with dementia. The purpose of this study was to identify the perceptions of persons with dementia and their caregivers about the use of telehealth to receive OT services. A qualitative descriptive design was used. Results provided themes in three domains: dementia journey, skills for technology use, and perceptions of OT. Each participant identified a unique journey through awareness, challenges, and adaptive strategies as they adjusted to a life with dementia. The skills for technology focused on current usage and perceptions about technology. Participants had limited knowledge of OT but did appreciate the role it has in dementia care. The themes identified in the study provide support for further exploration of the use of telehealth in OT for persons with dementia and their caregivers.","343":"As the older adult population in the United States increases and diversifies, understanding and reducing risks for hospitalization and institutionalization can reduce burdens for this vulnerable population. Using evidence-based assessment tools to understand medical, psychosocial, pharmacologic, and functional status can aid an interprofessional team to best evaluate older adults at risk. By providing culturally competent care for a diversifying older adult demographic, attention to social determinants can improve health equity for this population. This article describes in a case study exemplar, how one such interprofessional collaborative practice program, Geriatric Outreach and Training with Care (GOT Care!) provides a comprehensive assessment for high-risk older adults, identifies and documents these risks, and shares recommendations and rationale with the primary care provider toward risk reduction and improvement of outcomes.","344":"More than 20 million Veterans currently live in the United States, representing World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan war eras, as well as many who served during peacetime. Little is known regarding what home care nurses know about the unique healthcare needs of this population. Using Purnell's Model for Cultural Competence, a mixed-methods study was designed to examine home care nurse's knowledge, comfort, and confidence in caring for active military, Veterans and their families. This article provides the data from a national survey of 102 home care nurses. Findings suggest that civilian home care nurses have limited experience working with active military but work with Veterans at least monthly, if not weekly. Nurses were most confident in managing pain and least confident in managing issues related to military sexual trauma. Knowledge of resources available to Veterans, war-specific exposures, and Veteran-specific health issues were the top areas nurses felt less confident in. Continued efforts need to be put in place so that 100% of all patients seeking healthcare are screened for military\/Veteran status. In addition, continuing education for nurses needs to include Veteran-specific topics so evidence-based, culturally sensitive care can be provided.","345":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, once fatal, has become a chronic disease that can be treated and well-managed. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) can result in undetectable levels of HIV in the bloodstream. The risk factors, transmission, diagnosis, treatment, acute HIV infection, potential opportunistic infections, and malignancies should be understood by all those caring for persons living with HIV. Preventive treatment is possible with preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis regimens. Home healthcare providers can assist individuals to adhere to medication regimens, monitor efficacy of treatment, recognize complications of HIV and side effects of ART. Most importantly, they can support, educate, and counsel persons living with HIV and their families.","346":"","347":"","348":"","349":"","350":"","351":"","352":"","353":"","354":"","355":"","356":"","357":"","358":"Driving safety for older adults with dementia presents a continuing complex challenge in the community. More than 5 million people in the United States suffer from dementia, and their numbers are expected to grow. Evidence-based resources to identify and manage driving risks in older adults with dementia do exist, but the challenges of limited time in primary care and outpatient settings can make application difficult. This innovative project, funded by a Hartford Foundation Change Agents Action grant award, focused on interprofessional work to address the educational need for primary care professionals and family caregivers to manage driving safety for their loved ones with dementia. An interactive theater performance with development of an educational DVD was tested in a sample of professional and family caregivers. This project also forged new sustainable interprofessional community partnerships among educators\/researchers and healthcare providers caring for this vulnerable community population.","359":"The increasing older adult population guarantees that healthcare providers are more likely to encounter patients requiring treatment for unintended weight loss. Due to physiologic changes that occur in the older adult, it is important to know how to assess for, and diagnose unintended weight loss, as well as understand the treatment options. In addition to the use of enteral and parenteral nutrition, appetite stimulants have been used in older adults. Understanding the dosage, side effects, and proper usage of appetite stimulants, such megestrol acetate, mirtazapine, and dronabinol, is crucial in order to provide safe and effective patient care.","360":"Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for admission to the hospital in people over the age of 65 and has been found to be a possible complication following a joint replacement. Self-management education has been shown to reduce hospital readmissions rates among patients with HF and to cause significant improvements. The purpose of this case report was to describe physical therapy (PT) self-management education in the care of a patient with both a recent hip replacement (THR) surgery and HF. 85-year-old female with a THR and HF. Objective measurements included Timed Up and Go Test (TUG); 10-meter walk test (10MWT) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Standard PT care for THR and self-management education strategies was provided. The patient was seen two times per week for nine weeks. Improvements were noted in all outcome measures: (TUG, 10MWT, 6MWT). The patient was able to meet all ambulation goals and become independent in transfers. In this case, self-management education was shown to provide positive benefits by increasing functional mobility and helping prevent further complications from HF. Self- management education in the home health setting is important for older adult patients who had a THR. ","361":"Medication literacy is the ability of individuals to access and understand medication information and then use that information to act and take their medication in a safe and appropriate way. The purpose of this study was to explore medication literacy in a group of Somali older adults and their families using qualitative secondary analysis. We conducted an analytic expansion of an existing qualitative study that explored the home healthcare perceptions of Somali older adults and their families. Qualitative data collected from 14 Somali families about home healthcare were reviewed and analyzed for material related to medication literacy. Data analysis revealed a number of important findings related to medication literacy and resulted in the discovery of four themes: Medication literacy is needed among Somali older adults and their families, Using home healthcare (HHC) to improve medication literacy, Better communication is essential to improving medication literacy, and Medication literacy is an intersecting family and social issue. The results of this study indicate that HHC has a role to play in improving the health and medication literacy of these families. They also highlight the need to further explore what techniques, tools, and\/or supports HHC professionals need to care for non-English speaking populations. Future research needs to address how to meet the needs of diverse and vulnerable patients like Somali older adults, and how best to prepare HHC providers to do this.","362":"Lice infestation is a common health issue affecting 6 to 12 million school-age children in the United States each year, impacting all members of the household. The home care nurse can be a valuable resource in the management of lice in the home and can assist the family in understanding the various myths and misconceptions about lice. This article provides an overview of lice management, including identification and treatment of a lice infestation as well as recommendations for environmental control strategies in the home. It includes an overview of the various over-the-counter and prescription treatment options and highlights the social stigma that is often associated with a lice infestation.","363":"Human trafficking is a global problem reaping $150 billion annually, mainly from commercial sex or forced labor activities involving adult and child victims. Eighty-seven percent of human trafficking victims are known to have been seen by a healthcare provider at least once during the time held captive, but due to lack of awareness, this opportunity to identify and aid victims is often missed. Home healthcare providers have access to homes where human trafficking victims may be hidden in plain sight. It is critical that home healthcare providers know the signs of human trafficking, how to screen a potential victim, how to report any suspicious activities, and ways to remain safe while working in the community. If a human trafficking victim or perpetrator is identified or even suspected, home healthcare providers should move to a safe location and call the 24\/7 National Human Trafficking Hotline (1-888-373-7888).","364":"","365":"","366":"","367":"","368":"","369":"","370":"","371":"","372":"","373":"","374":"The Pacific Islands Geriatric Education Center of the University of Hawaii conducted situational assessments of caregivers, older adults, and healthcare professionals in the Republic of Palau. The findings revealed an urgent need for a solution to the identified crisis of an aging population, increasing chronic diseases and their corresponding impact on caregivers and society. In 2010, the National Healthcare Financing Act was signed into law, becoming Palau's first step in helping residents and workers in Palau pay for medical expenses. This program is referred to as the Health Care Fund and consists of two parts: National Health Insurance and Medical Savings Account. Advocacy and promotion of home healthcare services in Palau was facilitated by the Pacific Islands Geriatric Education Center. Because of these efforts, systems changed to establish home healthcare services and expand the Health Care Fund with a proposed Home Health Insurance Benefit from the National Health Insurance. This is a huge leap forward to improve access to care for older adults and homebound in Palau.","375":null,"376":"The objective of this observational time and motion study was to increase our understanding of how nurses in home healthcare currently distribute their work time with a focus on the medication management process. The research was conducted in four municipalities in the southern part of Sweden. Participants were nurses working in home healthcare. The study measured proportion of time, comparison of proportions of time, proportion of time spent multitasking, and rate of interruptions per hour. Of total observed time, 20.4% was spent on medication management and of these tasks the highest proportion of time was spent on communications and dispensing medications. Nurses in nursing homes spent more time (23.0% vs. 17.4%, p = 0.001) on medication management than nurses in private homes. Nurses spent 47.9% of their time completing tasks with someone else, including patients, but had minimal interaction with prescribers. We observed a rate of 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.4) interruptions per hour on average and 30% of all interruptions occurred during medication management tasks. Nurses spent 3.7% of their time multitasking. Interruptions while performing medication-related tasks were common, as well as multitasking. Causes and consequences of the results need to be addressed in order to improve the safety of medication management for patients receiving municipality-based home care.","377":"Urinary incontinence (UI) in older adult patients poses a risk for complications and hospitalization. The aim of this quality improvement project was to develop and implement a protocol to promote continence in older adults with UI. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 26 participants, 80 years of age or older, in a midsize suburban home care agency. All participants were diagnosed with UI as documented in the Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). OASIS question M1610 was used to identify patients with UI status, and M1650 was used, to identify UI frequency. The outcomes for these questions were assessed to examine change over time in UI status and frequency. Eligible patients completed a 3-day bladder diary, then patient education was conducted on UI, risk factors, bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, and hydration\/nutrition parameters. Patients then completed 3-day bladder diaries postintervention. At pretest, 100% of the participants were incontinent. At posttest, 24 participants (92.3%) were incontinent. The results suggest that the median frequency of UI declined overtime from 2 (range: 1-4) at pretest to 1 (range: 0-4) at posttest. This decline was statistically significant (z = -3.83; p &lt; .001). Future studies should examine changes in the UI complications and hospitalization rates.","378":"Assuring home care staff competencies through simulation has the potential to improve care transitions and clinical outcomes. Recreating a home environment can be used for orientation of home care staff and to meet other learning needs. Lessons learned from the use of simulation in a geriatric nursing course in a prelicensure program can be used to prepare clinicians for transitioning patients across care settings. With simulation, learners can identify challenges in patient safety, pain management, and management of patients' cognitive decline as well as learn how to communicate with patients, family members, and the healthcare team. Simulation, as an interactive pedagogy, provides opportunities for learners to practice assessment, monitoring, and patient care in a controlled, safe, risk-free environment. Following participation in a simulation, learners are given the opportunity to reflect on ways to improve patient care when transitioning from acute to home care settings. Simulations described in this article can be used for orientation of staff to a home healthcare agency because they allow clinicians to hone the skills necessary for patient care in the home. Staff educators can also use simulation to validate staff competencies in caring for patients at home.","379":"Home healthcare clinicians are in a unique position to assess patients for risk of osteoporosis and fragility fractures. They are also key members of the interdisciplinary care team in the recovery of patients with fragility fractures. Home healthcare clinicians care for an aging patient population with diverse conditions and multiple medications that can increase their risk of osteoporosis. Bone mineral density in addition to an evaluation of clinical risk factors are necessary to diagnose osteoporosis; DEXA and FRAX are the tools available. Undertreatment of osteoporosis is common among community dwelling elderly adults. Lack of patient adherence and insufficient physician prescription of medications are common. There are a wide array of osteoporosis medications and patients need education about their use. With the growing number of older adults in the population, increasing numbers will be vulnerable to osteoporosis and fragility fracture. Home healthcare clinicians need to be proactive to assess the aging population and assist in their treatment of this common disorder.","380":"","381":"","382":"","383":"","384":"","385":"","386":"","387":"","388":"","389":"","390":"","391":"Star Ratings were implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for home healthcare agencies with the first release of measures in 2015 and 2016.

The loss of sensory function can decrease the extent to which older adults can communicate, especially with their healthcare providers. The purpose of this article is to examine communication between older adults and healthcare providers, focusing on best practices and devices that can enhance and benefit their health and well-being. One consideration is the use of digital technology, such as smart phones, electronic tablets, and computers, to help mitigate the effects of aging on communication.","393":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disease and the most common cause of nontraumatic disability in young adults in the United States. It strikes adults in the prime of life and can gradually diminish physical and mental function, affect relationships, employment, financial capacity, and independence. Neurologic symptoms fluctuate in a pattern of remissions and exacerbations for the majority of those with MS. A multidisciplinary treatment approach is essential. There are a wide number of medications that can be used. Treating the disease at an early stage within the first 5 years of clinical symptom onset is optimal. Home healthcare clinicians can use assessment tools to evaluate disease progression, teach the patient and family how to live with the disorder, and monitor the patient for medication side effects.","394":"The United States is witnessing a growing aging population stemming in part from medical advancements allowing people to live decades longer than previous generations. Simultaneously, food insecurity among older adults has increased, and is projected to get worse as the Baby Boomer generation ages. This review focuses on an assistance program for older adults: home-delivered meals. Specifically, we focus on the effects of Meals on Wheels (MOW) on the physical and emotional well-being of older adults, and the wide variety of procedural and operational issues that various MOW programs around the country experience. Findings from the literature highlight the positive outcomes these programs have on their clients. Although there have been recent budget cut threats from the federal government, evidence suggests that more funding should be allocated so these programs can provide services to everyone in need, and even expand what they are able to offer to older adults.","395":"Pediatric home care nurses often become a valuable part of the family unit, and this can blur the professional boundary between nurse and patient. Home care professionals must educate themselves as well as patients and family members about the integrity of their professional relationship, and prevent boundary crossing before it occurs. This article highlights four case studies that describe situations of boundary crossing that could have been managed differently. Strategies for maintaining professional boundaries with patients and their families are provided.","396":"One of the dilemmas facing home healthcare nurses is the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) in the home setting coupled with being assured and confident that the NGT tip is in the correct position, that is, the stomach. There are very limited data to address the issue of management of an NGT in the home care setting with even less guidance for the pediatric population. Therefore, home healthcare nurses must use agency policy and procedures coupled with their own education, knowledge, experience, and skills when performing this procedure.

In the present study we: 1) examine the association of musculoskeletal pain to life satisfaction and emotional exhaustion; and 2) characterize interest in meditation and yoga in a sample of HHAs. A nonprobabilistic sample of HHAs employed at home healthcare agencies in Florida, Massachusetts, and Oregon (n = 285 total) completed a self-administered questionnaire with standard survey measures on musculoskeletal pain location, duration, and severity; life satisfaction; emotional exhaustion; and interest in meditation techniques and yoga. Among HHAs responding, 48.4% reported pain in the last 7 days and 46.6% reported pain in the last 3 months. Home healthcare aides who reported current pain and chronic pain had a significant (P &lt; .05) decrease in satisfaction with life score and a significant increase in emotional exhaustion score. The majority of HHAs reported an interest in learning about the benefits (65.6%) and practice (66.4%) of meditation and a willingness to participate in a yoga class (59.2%) or stress management meeting (59.1%). The HHAs reported both acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain that was correlated with lower life satisfaction and greater emotional exhaustion. More efforts are needed to reduce the sources of injury and emotional exhaustion.","410":"Children with medical complexity receive care from many healthcare providers including home healthcare nurses. The objective of our study, based on a conceptual framework, was to describe the relationships between parents\/caregivers of children with medical complexity and home healthcare nurses caring for these children. We collected qualitative data in 20 semistructured in-depth interviews (15 English, 5 Spanish) with 26 primary caregivers of children with medical complexity, and 4 focus groups of 18 home healthcare nurses inquiring about their experiences about home healthcare nursing services for children with medical complexity. During an iterative analysis process, we identified recurrent themes related to caregiver-nurse relationships. Our study showed that: (1) caregiver-nurse relationships evolved over time and were determined by multiple factors; (2) communication and trust were essential to the establishment of caregiver-nurse relationships; (3) both caregivers and nurses described difficulties of navigating physical, professional, personal, and emotional boundaries, and identified strategies to maintain these boundaries; and (4) good caregiver-nurse relationships helped in the care of children with medical complexity, reduced caregiver burden, resulted in less stress for nurses, and was a factor in nurse retention. We conclude that trusted relationships between caregivers and nurses are important to the home care of children with medical complexity. Interventions to develop and maintain good caregiver-nurse relationships are necessary.","411":"Heart failure is a significant burden to the healthcare system.

Fragmentation of electronic health record (EHR) systems, transitions of care, lack of physician-nurse in-person contact, and poor understanding of medications by patients and their families put patients at risk for serious adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop and test the HOME tool, an informatics tool to improve communication about medication regimens, share the insights of home care nurses with physicians, and highlight to physicians and nurses the complexity of medication schedules. We used human computer interaction design and evaluation principles, automated extraction from standardized forms, and modification of existing EHR fields to highlight key medication-related insights that had arisen during the SHHC visit. Separate versions of the tool were developed for physicians\/nurses and patients\/caregivers. A pilot of the tool was conducted using 20 SHHC encounters. Home care nurses and physicians found the tool useful for communication. Home care nurses were able to implement the HOME tool into their clinical workflow and reported improved communication with physicians about medications. This simple and largely automated tool improves understanding and communication around medications in SHHC.","429":"","430":"","431":"","432":"","433":"","434":"","435":"","436":"","437":"","438":"","439":"","440":"Despite the growing homebound population and the development of innovative models of care that work to bring care to people in their homes, home visits are not a routine part of education for many healthcare providers. This manuscript describes the experience of Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors teaching home-based primary care to learners of various disciplines and reports the results of a survey performed to assess trainee experience. Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors is the largest academic home-based primary care program in the country and trainees of various disciplines have nearly 1,700 contact days annually of directly supervised clinical teaching. In order to improve trainee education and meet our practice needs, trainees: 1) independently conduct urgent visits, 2) carry longitudinal panels of homebound patients, and 3) perform subspecialist consultations. Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors has exposed thousands of trainees to home-based primary care in the past 20 years and trainees report positive reviews of their experiences. As the need to train future providers in home-based primary care grows, we will be challenged to provide trainees with adequate exposure to multidisciplinary teams and to teach about the importance of continuity of care.","441":"The aging population of the United States has led to a need for more direct care workers to provide personal care to older adults and disabled people in their homes. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts employment of paraprofessionals in home care will grow 49% between 2012 and 2022 as the baby boomer generation ages and requires more assistance in activities of daily living. The typical direct care worker is a female aged 25 to 54 years old, a demographic that is projected to remain flat in the coming years. Direct care workers typically are poorly paid for work that is labor-intensive and often work in less than optimal working conditions. It is important that agencies hiring direct care workers understand the challenges these workers face and institute sound hiring practices and provide proper training and ongoing supervision. It is possible to have a quality direct care team. Proper training, role modeling, and supervision will improve employee satisfaction, decrease turnover, and improve care outcomes for patients.","442":"Modern federal healthcare fraud investigations use big data to find outliers among providers who are then targeted for enforcement actions. This approach is being used to pursue an outsized number of criminal cases against home healthcare agencies, resulting in decades-long prison sentences and tens of millions in fines. But it is remarkably transparent, giving home healthcare providers ample opportunity to stay out of harm's way. The government has provided the statistical characteristics by which it searches for fraud among home healthcare agencies, along with the benchmarks it uses to determine who is an outlier. And enforcement actions against home healthcare agencies have consistently targeted the same conduct: payments to payment recruiters and physicians in return for referring patients who often do not need the services billed. This article provides practical advice on how home healthcare agencies can gauge and limit their own legal exposure by monitoring their statistics against the government's benchmarks and by instituting basic controls to prevent targeted conduct.","443":"Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among adults 65 years and older. Each year, one in three older adults experiences a fall, and people who fall are more likely to fall again.

We collected qualitative data in 20 semistructured in-depth interviews (15 English, 5 Spanish) with 26 primary caregivers of children with medical complexity, and 4 focus groups of 18 home healthcare nurses inquiring about their experiences about home healthcare nursing services for children with medical complexity. During an iterative analysis process, we identified recurrent themes related to stability of home healthcare nursing. Lack of stability in home healthcare nursing was common. These include: (1) not finding nurses to cover shifts, (2) nurse turnover, (3) nurses calling out frequently, and (4) nurses being fired by caregivers. Reasons for lack of stability of home healthcare nursing services were multifactorial and included: nurse-level, child-level, caregiver-level, residence-level, agency-level, and system-level factors. Lack of stable home healthcare nursing affected the well-being of children with medical complexity, and contributed to substantial caregiver burden. There were negative implications of unstable home healthcare services for nurses and home healthcare agencies as well. Lack of stable home healthcare nursing services is a major problem in the home care of children with medical complexity. Although some of the factors for unstable home healthcare nursing services are not modifiable, there are others that are potentially modifiable. Ensuring stable home healthcare nursing services will likely improve care of children and reduce caregiver burden.","471":"As a home care and hospice consultant, I have written a newspaper column about caregiving in Sarasota County, Florida, a county with a median population age of 55 years (City-Data.com, n.d.) for many years. The following story is one of many I hear about every year. Sarah, an 86-year-old woman, has moved in with her adult daughter and son-in-law. My involvement began with a phone call from this very distraught couple who were trying to do the right thing and bring a family member into their home when it became obvious she was no longer safe on her own. This move did not occur with much forethought or planning; however, it soon became clear that Sarah was very demanding and difficult, and would not follow the doctor's recommendations nor theirs. The son and daughter-in-law work full time and have two children, ages 14 and 18, living at home. They related that, although Sarah had always been \"prickly,\" her negative behaviors seemed magnified when she moved into their home. The last straw was when Sarah fired the aide they had hired to assist with her personal care. They knew they needed to regroup and develop a long-term plan that would be best for Sarah and her care needs.","472":"In rural Western New York, hospitalizations of patients over 65 years of age with heart failure (HF) exceed state and national levels, demonstrating a need for improved management of older adult HF patients in rural communities. The aim of this project was to implement an evidence-based practice (EBP) guideline for HF management at a certified home health agency (CHHA). The objective was to increase CHHA interdisciplinary staff knowledge and to implement an EBP HF guideline to improve care and reduce hospital readmission rates. This quality improvement project used a quantitative descriptive study design, with a convenience sample of 60 CHHA interdisciplinary staff. A series of four 30-minute educational sessions were provided to the staff regarding the EBP HF guideline. Data were collected using pre- and posteducation testing to assess knowledge. A 3-month evaluation was completed to assess implementation along with readmission data pre- and postimplementation. Of the 60 interdisciplinary staff who received the EBP HF guideline education, 17 participants completed both the pretest and posttest. Results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in knowledge from the pretest (Md = 60.00%) to the posttest (Md = 80.00%) (p = .001). In the 3-month follow-up survey, 66% of the staff reported using the EBP HF guideline on \"most\" or \"all\" older adult HF patients.

The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans encourages us to eat a greater variety of protein foods. One way to do this is to choose seafood twice a week in place of meats, poultry, or eggs. Seafood, which includes fish and shellfish, is recommended for the total package of nutrients it provides. However, the average American is eating much less seafood than recommended. Whether that's due to taste preferences, lack of confidence with buying or preparing seafood, or concern about potential contaminants like methyl mercury, healthcare professionals have an important role. You can help to clear up confusion and encourage patients and clients-particularly women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and parents and caregivers of young children-to include seafood as part of an overall healthy eating pattern.","483":"","484":"To address rehospitalization rates and emergency department rates that were above the state and national averages, a quality improvement project was implemented at a midsized home healthcare agency. In order to address these escalating rates, the Home Health Universal Best Practice Protocol was developed and implemented by a home healthcare consultant. The protocol is evidence-based, time-specific, comprehensive, and includes interventions that are linked to reducing avoidable hospital visits. Interventions include risk assessment for rehospitalization, initiation of telehealth, utilization of teach-back method, and timely documentation. The Home Health Universal Best Practice Protocol was effective in not only exceeding objectives regarding decreasing rehospitalization and emergency department rates within a 6-month period but also in improving home healthcare agency referral rates.","485":"","486":"Along with a variety of distressing symptoms, a diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM) brings with it substantial physical, psychosocial, and financial costs. Research shows that self-management is an effective means to manage FM and can lead to fewer healthcare visits. Yet due to the complexity of this disorder, healthcare providers need to be able to tailor treatment to individual patients by understanding effective treatment interventions. Home healthcare nurses (HHNs) are in a unique position to assess and implement effective treatment recommendations in the home setting and as such could consider incorporating self-management strategies into the home visit with the FM patient. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to use a case study to describe the assessment of FM patient's functional ability and quality of life and how the HHN may integrate self-management teaching into the established home care visit. A review of the literature and discussion of self-management interventions for the FM patient is presented.

The research questions that guided this focused literature review were (1) What are the modifiable risk factors of 30-day readmission after CABG surgery identified in recent literature? and (2) What are the clinical programs and strategies available in preventing 30-day readmission after CABG surgery? A focused literature review from 1997 to 2014 yielded 17 published reports. Findings of this review revealed a significant gap between addressing modifiable patient-specific risk factors and the current clinical program initiatives, which are focused on care processes. Clinical programs and strategies for 30-day readmission after CABG surgery are evolving. Many programs and studies have included discharge planning and education as interventions to prevent 30-day readmissions; however, there is inconsistency in the literature on the impact of early discharge on readmission. Future studies need to focus on targeting the clinical modifiable risk factors and discharge planning and education, which may help to prevent 30-day readmissions.","497":"The progressive nature of dementia marks this disease as a terminal illness in the advanced stage, and palliative care rather than curative treatment is indicated. The use of feeding tubes to deliver artificial nutrition and hydration at end of life is often part of the plan of care for people with dementia. Current evidence, however, suggests that tube feeding in advanced dementia is not beneficial and the burdens of the procedure and the feedings themselves outweigh any benefits. Evidence also reveals that healthcare providers may lack evidence-based knowledge about artificial nutrition and hydration to adequately inform families and surrogate decision makers. This article examines the evidence regarding use of artificial nutrition and hydration for patients with end-stage dementia and offers implications for home care clinicians.","498":"A review of literature revealed a lack of research pertaining to nurses' or student nurses' knowledge of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and the ability to troubleshoot CPAP malfunction.

Is there a change after participation in a simulation with a patient on CPAP in home setting? Twenty-one ADN students enrolled in small Midwest college participated. A preexperimental design of one group pretest posttest was used. Each student completed a demographic questionnaire, Mayo High Performance Teamwork Scale, Interprofessional collaborative simulation experience survey, and a CPAP knowledge base survey before and upon completion of the simulation. There were no changes in students' comfort, baseline knowledge, and basic understanding regarding CPAP. However, after the simulation, students described more detailed problem-solving skills, which included using respiratory therapists, durable medical equipment providers, and community resources.

Pharmacy personnel who provide onsite consultations in a home healthcare setting used the question list to identify medication-related problems that could contribute to nonadherence and to document potential solutions. Through pharmacist-patient interactions, which occurred after admission to the home healthcare agency, pharmacy personnel found on average 2.3 issues per patient, which could affect medication adherence. Side effects were the most common problem identified.

The databases PubMed\/Medline, LILACS, and National Guideline Clearinghouse were searched for articles published between January 1985 and June 2015. Although there is an extensive literature and clear guidelines for the prophylaxis and treatment of VTE in the hospital environment, studies on the same subject in home care are scarce, sometimes small, and almost exclusively based on retrospective collection of chart data.

Forty-five percent of those older than 65 years will have ongoing clinical needs after hospital discharge and require postacute care (PAC) services in settings such as home healthcare (HHC) and skilled nursing facilities (SNF). The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 requires PAC providers to begin collecting and reporting ADL data to build a coordinated approach to payment and standardize patient assessments and quality measurement. The aim of this integrative review was to compare the methods of assessing ADLs in HHC to SNF. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was used to ensure results were reported systematically. A scientific literature search without date restriction within the PubMed and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases was conducted. Two independent investigators assessed study quality using the quality appraisal instrument developed by Kmet et al. Study quality was high. Of the 18,749 articles identified by the search, 8 met inclusion criteria and four tools were identified that are used to assess ADLs in SNF and HHC. Although SNF and HHC collect similar ADL information, the range of content covered, item definitions, scoring, and psychometrics are not comparable across settings.","511":"As the world prepares for an increasingly aging population with chronic debilitating diseases, the demand for home healthcare services is increasing.

The usual care for these patients involves transport to an Emergency Department (ED) despite the preference of most palliative patients to stay home. The objective of this initiative was to develop an innovative strategy to provide collaborative care in the home to alleviate symptoms and avoid transport. A partnership was created among Emergency Medical Services and Community Care staff, physicians, and leaders to enable patients to stay at home with existing resources during symptom crisis. As a result of the initiative, patients were able to stay at home more frequently. When patients required transport to the ED, it occurred after attempted symptom management in the home. A total of 110 calls were tracked in the first 18 months of the initiative. Of those, 61% ended with the patient staying home, in alignment with their preferred place of care at the end of life.

Despite the occupational injury rates for HHC workers (HHCW) being higher than the national average, an understanding of the occupational safety and health experiences and exposures of HHCW is limited. The purpose of this study was to understand the health and safety risk factors for HHCW. One-on-one interviews were conducted with HHCW to elicit frequency of daily occupational exposures to hazards and risk factors during visits to patients' homes. Approximately 67% of the study population was over 40 years old and mostly obese, potentially increasing risk for injury. HHCW routinely perform physical tasks with increased risk for occupational musculoskeletal injuries. Exposures to drug residue from dispensing oral medications and anticancer medications and exposure to potentially infectious agents and cleaning chemicals used for infection prevention were reported. The majority of HHCW were also exposed to secondhand smoke and occasionally experienced violence. Developing and implementing intervention strategies that address engineering controls, establish employee safety-related policies, provide training and retraining, promote a healthy lifestyle among HHCW, and providing suitable personal protective equipment may help to decrease occupational injury rates.","537":"Older adults who exhibit extreme behaviors present a complex diagnostic and management picture for home healthcare clinicians and family caregivers.

A comparative effectiveness study was undertaken at a large urban home care agency to examine an evidence-based pain self-management program delivered by physical therapists (PTs). This article focuses on PT training, methods implemented to reinforce content after training and to encourage uptake of the program with appropriate patients, and therapists' fidelity to the program. Seventeen physical therapy teams were included in the cluster randomized controlled trial, with 8 teams (155 PTs) assigned to a control and 9 teams (165 PTs) assigned to a treatment arm. Treatment therapists received interactive training over two sessions, with a follow-up session 6 months later. Additional support was provided via emails, e-learning materials including videos, and a therapist manual. Program fidelity was assessed by examining PT pain documentation in the agency's electronic health record. PT feedback on the program was obtained via semistructured surveys. There were no between-group differences in the number of PTs documenting program elements with the exception of instruction in the use of imagery, which was documented by a higher percentage of intervention therapists (p = 0.002). PTs felt comfortable teaching the program elements, but cited time as the biggest barrier to implementing the protocol. Possible explanations for study results suggesting limited adherence to the program protocol by intervention-group PTs include the top-down implementation strategy, competing organizational priorities, program complexity, competing patient priorities, and inadequate patient buy-in. Implications for the implementation of complex new programs in the home healthcare setting are discussed.","549":"","550":"Portable electronic medical records used by home care nurses do not provide well-organized displays of previous documentation regarding patient care. The retrieved information is in a disorderly format; therefore, clinicians have to manually organize necessary information from multiple screens.

Four health problems (congestive heart failure, anticoagulation, ulcer wounds, and diabetes) and health problem-specific key data were selected based on home care practice and presented in the respective clinical dashboards. A questionnaire developed by the researchers consisted of 28 closed-ended and 2 open-ended questions to assess home care nurses' perceptions of the clinical dashboards in the scenario. Fourteen of 19 nurses recruited from three home care organizations positively perceived the clinical dashboards presented in the scenario and provided suggestions for improvement.

This article describes an innovative and comprehensive contraception protocol that was developed for Nurse-Family Partnership to improve contraception education for home healthcare patients. The protocol focused on increasing uptake of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) for high-risk prenatal and postpartum home healthcare patients. The protocol was designed to reduce early subsequent pregnancies and thereby improve outcomes for mothers and their infants. An evidence-based translation project was designed and piloted in three California counties. The protocol consisted of a contraception education module for nurses and a patient education toolkit. The toolkit included an interactive patient education workbook emphasizing LARC methods for nurses to complete with their patients along with other teaching tools. The project was evaluated using pre- and posttest surveys that measured changes in nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and practice before, after, and 2 months after implementation. Outcomes revealed the following statistically significant results: (a) nurses' knowledge doubled at the first posttest and persisted at 2 months, (b) nurses' attitudes improved on two of the three measures, and (c) there was a 17.7% increase in the frequency of LARC birth control education 2 months after implementation. An evidence-based contraception protocol can promote acceptance of LARC methods and improve home healthcare clinician comfort with and frequency of birth control education.","577":"As a result of the Affordable Care Act, increases in aging populations, and advances in technologies, there is a critical need for highly qualified, competent home healthcare nurses.

During an iterative analysis process, recurrent themes were identified by their prevalence and salience in the data. Home healthcare nurses collaborate with many providers within the medical neighborhood of children with medical complexity and perform many different collaborative tasks. This collaboration is valued by caregivers and nurses, but is inconsistent. Home healthcare nurses' communication with other clinicians is important to the delivery of good-quality care to children with medical complexity at home, but is not always present. Home healthcare nurses reported inability to share clinical information with other clinicians, not receiving child-specific information, and lack of support for clinical problem-solving as concerns. Barriers for optimal collaboration included lack of preparedness of parents, availability of physicians for clinical support, reimbursement for collaborative tasks, variability in home healthcare nurses' tasks, and problems at nursing agency level. Home healthcare nurses' collaboration with other clinicians is important, but problems exist in the current system of care. Optimizing collaboration between home healthcare nurses and other clinicians will likely have a positive impact on these children and their families. ","590":"The ability of home healthcare nurses to effectively educate patients with heart failure (HF) on appropriate self-care is key to lowering the hospital readmission rates and other adverse outcomes. Evidence indicates, however, that nurses often lack current knowledge about HF self-care. Furthermore, patient education often fails to produce health literacy. Thus, this educational intervention for home healthcare nurses included content about key aspects of managing HF (e.g., diet, medications), as well as how to use the teach-back method during patient education. Pre- and posttesting (using the Nurses' Knowledge of HF Education Principles Questionnaire) and role-playing were used to evaluate the intervention delivered to 33 home care nurses. Findings exposed knowledge deficits regarding high-sodium foods, symptoms indicating deterioration, problematic weight gain, fluid management, as well as other topics related to HF. The education was partially effective in addressing these nurses' knowledge gaps. The evidence-based education for home healthcare nurses suggests that not only may nurses lack knowledge essential to teaching HF self-care; they may also lack effective patient education skills such as using the teach-back method.

Several interprofessional organizations and nurse leaders have called for the expansion and redesign of undergraduate nursing curricula to include care transitions. Yet there is little evidence describing how undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students are educated on this critical topic or how successful they are in improving student knowledge about care transitions. To address this gap, an in-classroom and clinical experience was implemented to prepare students to manage and facilitate care transitions from the hospital to alternative settings-including the home. Perceptions of undergraduate nursing students and home healthcare nurse preceptors were assessed via an electronic survey that was emailed to participants. Forty-eight responses to the survey were received. Students agreed this experience contributed to their understanding of caring for adults and older adults who are experiencing a care transition and they had a good understanding of care transitions to apply to their future nursing courses. Home healthcare nurse preceptors agreed they were able to demonstrate transitional care and that students were engaged.

Part of a mixed-methods study, the qualitative portion examined perceptions of home healthcare nurses in a rural area in the southern United States. Seventeen home healthcare nurses participated in this study. Semistructured focus group interview questions were used. Constant comparative analysis was the method used for coding transcripts. Three themes emerged from the analysis: patient\/family comfort, futility, and symbols of suffering. Although many of the nurses reported that artificial nutrition and hydration was of comfort to the patient and family because of the potential for \"starving,\" they also felt it prolonged the patient's suffering due to the invasive procedure, need for restraints, and possibility of fluid overload. Several nurses felt that artificial nutrition and hydration gave a sense of false hope to the family that the patient would live longer. The perceptions of these home healthcare nurses influence their care to people with dementia and their families related to artificial nutrition and hydration, possibly based on experience. Their perceptions could influence family decisions regarding treatment options.

Developmental changes such as hearing, speech, vision, and cognition profoundly impede an older adult's ability to communicate with others, potentially undermining the quality of care delivered. The use of trigger films as an educational intervention can assist home care clinicians to improve communication with their patients. Trigger films are 2- to 4-minute video clips that end abruptly, encouraging learners to analyze clinical situations in a safe environment, such as a staff conference room. Trigger films are easy to make with the use of a smart phone and two staff members portraying the role of home care clinician and patient. Allowing discussion after viewing the trigger film places clinicians in an active learning role, thus fostering the sharing of ideas and best practice. Addressing age-related barriers to communication with this modality serves to improve patient interaction and healthcare outcomes. The use of trigger films is another tool that empowers the clinician to provide improved care for patients with communication deficits. ","622":"The incidence and consequences of falls for older adults are well documented and well known to home care clinicians. In the absence of a falls-prevention program targeting older adults living in the community, home healthcare professionals at Cooley Dickinson VNA &amp; Hospice in Northampton, MA, observed a high rate of falls and hip fractures. The clinicians designed a falls reduction program titled Strength in Numbers, an evidence-informed, multifaceted approach offered in community settings such as local senior centers and retirement communities. Physical and occupational therapists presented sessions that addressed risk factors for falls: fear of falling, strength, balance, medications, vision, and home safety. This article describes the program, its evolution and expansion, and outcomes. Between 2008 and 2015, 1,974 people received falls-prevention education through one of several variations of Strength in Numbers. Nearly 20% of those returning for a follow-up session who had fallen before did not fall again after completing it. Presenters recorded statistically significant improvement for participants in Single-Leg Standing, Timed Up and Go, and Functional Reach tests. ","623":"Depression is a major health issue among older adults receiving home-based services yet is underdiagnosed and undertreated, which can result in negative health outcomes. Despite the recognized need for improved mental health services, significant gaps and barriers exist that contribute to less than optimal home-based depression management interventions. Home healthcare clinicians are well positioned to drive this effort for improving depression care with enhanced learning. Thus, the purpose of this article is to provide guidelines on improving depression care in homebound older adults based on four clinical functions central to home healthcare: screening, assessment, medication management, and patient\/family education.

As older adults age, their potential of experiencing chronic pain increases, and this is profound given that physiological research shows that African Americans, aside from aging, may have a predisposition for developing chronic pain. Research shows older African Americans experience significant chronic pain, but few have discussed the implications of managing chronic pain in older African Americans who have added parental responsibility. Many older African Americans receive home healthcare services and there is a unique role for home healthcare clinicians in caring for this vulnerable population.

Penalties mandated by the Affordable Care Act decrease hospital reimbursement and ultimately the overall cost of caring for these patients increases if they are not well managed. Approximately 25% of patients hospitalized for heart failure are at high risk for readmission and these rates have not changed over the past decade. As a result of an aging population, the incidence of heart failure is expected to increase to one in five Americans over the age of 65. Pharmacologic management can reduce the risk of death and help prevent unnecessary hospitalizations. Healthcare providers who have knowledge of heart failure medications and drug interactions and share this information with their patients contribute to improved long-term survival and physical functioning as well as fewer hospitalizations and a delay of progressive worsening of heart failure.

Nurses are essential practitioners for managing hypertension; however, it is unclear whether they have adequate knowledge of home BP management. This study assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of home BP measurement among Japanese nurses. A questionnaire regarding home BP measurement was distributed among nurses and collected by mail. A total of 6,002 (61.8%) responses were eligible for the study. The proportion of participants who correctly recognized the reference values for clinic BP and home BP was 9.9% and 2.8%. Midwives and those working for the government had the highest proportion of correct responses of reference values among all nursing subgroups. Participants who thought that home BP gave the most important BP information were 62.7%. About 60% of the participants who recommended home BP measurement to hypertensive patients preferred to recommend an upper-arm cuff device. Our findings suggested that more knowledge of home BP measurement among nurses is warranted.

Although the number of informal caregivers is expected to continue to increase, few programs have been established in home healthcare agencies to support these caregivers. This article describes a project that used a unique Web site to connect caregivers of people with dementia in a geographic region with an interprofessional group of healthcare providers and caregiver peers. Virtual Healthcare Neighborhood (VHN) was developed and maintained by an interprofessional group of healthcare providers from nursing, physical therapy, clinical counseling, and dental hygiene. The VHN provided weekly information on topics relevant to caring for a loved one with dementia at home as well as Question and Answer and Social Support Blogging sections for use by participants. This project was viewed as a positive and helpful method to provide support for caregivers of homebound older adults that could be easily replicated by home healthcare agencies. ","662":"Assistance from informal caregivers such as family members, friends, or neighbors is crucial to adequately managing the complex care of heart failure (HF) patients. This study examined the lived experience of African American caregivers caring for African American patients with HF. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 10 participants who were formally interviewed. The interviews, analyzed using Colaizzi's steps, revealed six themes: layers of support, realization of self-neglect, experiencing the \"blues,\" connecting with healthcare providers, unmet financial needs, and perception of nonadherence. The information regarding the experience of African American caregivers of HF patients obtained through this research will inform the delivery of culturally competent support to caregivers, thereby improving quality of life for both the HF patients and their caregivers. ","663":"Home health aides (HHAs) are members of a rapidly growing occupation. They often develop close ties to patients and their family and can experience significant grief when a patient dies. Yet agencies often provide little support or structure to help staff cope during this time. For instance, home care agencies do not always notify their staff of client death and some have policies in place to prevent any follow-up contact with a deceased client's family. Little is known about how these agency factors affect HHAs' work experience. This mixed-method study explored the experiences of 78 HHAs working either at an agency with a restrictive policy regarding contact with a client's family after client death or an agency without such a policy in place. Data were collected through semistructured in-person interviews. Employment outcomes included various aspects of job satisfaction and intention to change jobs. HHAs' responses to client death were assessed with measures of grief and grief processing, and with open-ended questions exploring their experiences in this context. Findings indicated that HHAs from the restrictive agency were significantly more likely to be considering other job options. They also reported significantly lower satisfaction with received supervision, and significantly less grief processing activity. Findings suggest that HHAs from the agency without a contact-restrictive policy had a more positive experience at work and more opportunity to process the client's death.

Computerized database and ancestry search strategies located distinct intervention trials between 1990 and 2015. A total of eight quantitative studies were reviewed. Four of the eight studies were randomized control trials and four studies used an uncontrolled pretest-posttest design. The eight studies represented a total of 1,221 participants with mean ages from 43 to 81. Study sample sizes ranged from 16 to 504. Seven of the eight studies demonstrated modest effect of nurse-delivered home-based interventions on physical activity behaviors. Home-based physical activity promotion was most often incorporated into secondary prevention of postacute diseases, chronic disease management, or disease prevention\/health promotion. Findings indicate that nurse-delivered home-based physical activity promotion show overall effectiveness in general adult populations. Possible effective intervention domains were also discussed in this review to guide future home-based health promotion.

The purpose of this article is to increase awareness of the unique healthcare needs of Vietnam Veterans. Having an understanding of military and Veteran culture can help inform home healthcare clinicians in ways to manage the unique healthcare needs of Veterans and engage previously learned behaviors and attitudes from military service. In addition, knowing the types of exposures and health risks specific to this era could be beneficial in identifying potential problems that may have not yet been addressed. ","765":"","766":"","767":"","768":"","769":"","770":"","771":"","772":"Depression and cardiovascular disease are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally. Depression significantly increases the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease and increases the risk of mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. Patients receiving home healthcare are disproportionally affected by depression. Comorbid depression can occur in two time frames: precardiac and postcardiac. It is imperative that home care patients be adequately screened and monitored for depressive symptoms. Home care patients with cardiac disease who are under treatment for depression should be carefully monitored for adherence to their medical care, drug efficacy, and safety with respect to their cardiovascular as well as mental health. ","773":"The purpose of this article is to review the nursing literature related to professional boundary violations in nursing. A search was conducted using CINAHL, MEDLINE, Ebscohost, and NCSBN. The key words searched were professional boundaries, boundary violation, boundary crossings, nurse, home health nurses, and home nursing. The search returned over 40 publications related specifically to boundary violations and nursing although only four of them are published research studies and one as a dissertation. Seven common characteristics emerged from the nonresearch nursing articles on professional boundaries: (1) Dual relations\/role reversal, (2) Gifts and money, (3) Excessive self-disclosure, (4) Secretive behavior, (5) Excessive attention\/overinvolvement, (6) Sexual behavior, and (7) Social media. Additional nursing research is greatly needed in the area of professional boundaries. The nurse-patient relationship should always be maintained for the benefit of the patient and not the personal gain of the nurse. Ongoing education in nursing practice regarding professional boundaries is needed. Nurses need to be mindful of state practice acts, codes of conduct, and employer policies. ","774":"Loneliness is a concept recently capturing the attention of nursing and other healthcare professionals due to its unfavorable effects on health outcomes. The purpose of this article is to convey the story of one widow named Audrey (pseudonym) and to describe her experiences of profound loneliness. Narratives from this single case study are reported as part of a larger qualitative, phenomenological study on loneliness in community-dwelling older adults. Findings from Audrey's story reveal intense periods of loneliness, longing and loss primarily resulting from the death of her spouse. Excerpts from these narratives uncover Audrey's coping strategies for loneliness, which included watching television, telephoning her children, reading the paper, and finding comfort in her faith. Audrey's story is essential for all home healthcare professionals to understand, as it illustrates the powerful impact of loneliness on the quality of life and health of an older adult. ","775":"Medication safety among community-dwelling older adults in the United States is an ongoing health issue impacting health outcomes, chronic disease management, and aging in place at home. This article describes a medication safety improvement project that aimed to: (1) Increase the ability of participants to manage medications, (2) Identify and make necessary medication changes, (3) Create an accurate up-to-date medication list to be available in the home, and (4) Provide communication between the primary care provider, participant, and case manager. An in-home medication assessment was completed for 25 participants using an evidence-based medication management software system. This process was used to review medications; identify medication-related problems; create a shared medication list; and convey this information to the primary care provider, case manager, and client while addressing needed medication changes. Educational interventions on management and understanding of medications were provided to participants to emphasize the correct use of medications and use of a personal medication record. Outcome improvements included provision of an accurate medication list, early identification of medication-related problems, identification of drug duplication, and identification of medication self-management challenges that can be useful for optimizing medication safety-related home healthcare and inform future interventions. ","776":"Diabetes is a common diagnosis for home care patients. Diabetes drugs are now available that target the multiple defects of metabolism that characterize Type 2 diabetes.

Educating patients with diabetes about foot care in a home-based setting could enable the home healthcare clinician to provide information that could help reduce the risk of ulcerations and amputations. The development of an algorithm to aid clinicians in providing recommended education would enable clinicians to practice using the best-available evidence. ","786":"A retrospective cohort study with adjustment for baseline group differences was conducted to determine if there was a difference in Outcome and Information Data Set (OASIS-C) activities of daily living (ADL) outcomes as well as the duration and number of home care visits between usual home care rehabilitation services and a home care rehabilitation team that was specially trained in falls identification and prevention. Data from adult Medicare beneficiaries who were treated in a large multistate home care practice with at least one visit by a physical therapist were retrieved retrospectively for analysis (n = 3,907 records). Patients identified as having multiple fall risk factors based on OASIS-C assessment undergoing a specialized care program demonstrated greater improvements in mean total ADL scores after home healthcare rehabilitation services compared with subjects at fall risk receiving usual care. Interdisciplinary care delivered by a healthcare team specially trained in fall prevention appeared to decrease the number of home care visits and resulted in improved ADL OASIS-C outcome scores after adjustment for potential confounders. ","787":"West Nile Virus is the most frequent cause of arboviral disease in the United States. It was first identified in the United States in 1999. Since that time, each of the 48 contiguous states in the United States has seen the disease, and it has been found in 96% of the U.S. counties in infected humans, mosquitoes, birds, horses, or other mammals. Although most often the disease resolves on its own, patients can develop serious and life-threatening complications, and may need further monitoring and treatment. This article reviews the prevalence, transmission, signs and symptoms, complications, treatment, surveillance, and prevention of the disease. ","788":"The use of telehealth by home healthcare agencies is growing. It has been shown to reduce rehospitalizations by up to 62%, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. Due to the use of telehealth technology, new and unique rules of etiquette must be followed to make both the patient and clinician comfortable and satisfied with the process. Little literature exists regarding telehealth etiquette. This article explores the techniques and methods that home care clinicians should utilize to assure that the telehealth experience is positive and effective. After providing a less successful scenario, steps for success are outlined and a suggested successful conclusion is provided for the scenario. Home care agencies will benefit greatly from expanding their ability to visit patients in different ways. Simple steps need to be taken to assure successful visits that follow the rules for assuring patient comfort, autonomy, and protection. ","789":"The Oncology Nursing Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology have established guidelines for the safe and effective use of chemotherapeutic medications in the acute and outpatient care settings. A review of literature was performed to determine the safe and effective administration of chemotherapy in the home environment. The administration of oral and intravenous chemotherapy in the home has become a common intervention for patients being treated for cancer based on patient preference, cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery, and increasing demand for oncology services. Home healthcare nurses can greatly impact the management of adverse effects of chemotherapy in the home, increasing the quality of life and improving patient outcomes.

This article describes the development of the Transitional Care Nurse (TCN) program and includes case studies that exemplify how the TCN can intervene to improve care coordination. ","798":"This exploratory qualitative study examined staff perceptions of social work student contributions to client services, family and client communication, and staff workload in an independent living setting for older adults. Ten employees who had contact with the students, clients, and family were interviewed using a semistructured interview method. The findings suggest a positive response to the presence of social work students in the enhancement of home healthcare and in this independent living environment. In particular, their contributions were viewed as helpful in client quality of life, quality of care, communication with clients and families, and work performance. ","799":"Legislative enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 created an impetus for change within the healthcare industry. As a result, the entire healthcare continuum is under greater scrutiny and incentives for performance levels and subsequent outcomes. Home healthcare clinicians have a vital role in the emerging spotlight of care transitions from hospital to home. Home healthcare clinicians will need to understand the concepts of patient engagement and patient activation, and have tactical plans for success. Understanding best practices and recommendations will be an element of competitive differentiation. This article reviews these concepts, along with interventions to target health literacy, communication with patients and families, and the use of motivational interviewing. ","800":"Home health clinicians frequently encounter patients with dementia living in the community. The plan of care is usually developed around the needs of the affected person, with focus on safety and quality of life. In caring for these individuals, the clinician is faced with an even greater task of supporting the caregiver and identifying caregiver fatigue and burden. Improving the competence and knowledge of caregivers is valuable in minimizing burden. Home care clinicians have the knowledge, skills, and resources to ease the burden of caregiving and prolong the time that the person with dementia can remain in the home. This article describes current research and approaches to care, specifically with problems involving behavior, functional limitations, and safety.

","823":"","824":"The prevalence of medication use among Americans is reported at 48% with significant linear increases with advancing age. A link between specific medication use and fall risk has been established. The purposes of this study are to describe (a) medication categories and (b) medication prevalence associated with fall risk prescribed to individuals case-managed by physical therapists (PTs) in home healthcare (HHC). Descriptive retrospective chart reviews of age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, and prescribed medication profiles were obtained from electronic health records (EHRs) of individuals case-managed by PTs at one HHC agency. Descriptive statistics of patient characteristics and medications were analyzed. The chi-square test compared difference by age, gender, and ethnicity. Ninety-five EHRs met criteria for inclusion. Eight hundred and nineteen total medications, comprising 403 medications and 34 medication categories were identified. The highest medication categories prescribed were pain relief (70.5%); cardiovascular agents (65.3%); vitamins, minerals, therapeutic nutrients, and electrolytes (60.0%); gastrointestinal (53.7%); and heart and cholesterol agents (45.3%). Fall risk indicators were identified including medication from a fall risk category (4.2%) and polypharmacy (90.5%). Individuals case-managed by PTs in the HHC setting are prescribed medications from a variety of medication categories including fall risk indicators. This study emphasizes the importance of PTs' review of medications during an initial examination to identify potential adverse events, including falls, which may occur as a result of medication usage. ","825":"Effective transitions to home care have been identified as among the factors leading to reducing hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge and improvements on various other quality measures. Innovative applications of published evidence-based models and best practices designed to improve care transitions have been implemented in various settings across the country in an effort to enhance quality performance. For this article, The Joint Commission collected a series of case examples to examine how evidence-based innovations in care transitions are reducing readmissions and improving other quality outcomes. The organizations providing the case examples were interviewed and asked to provide performance data demonstrating quality improvement, as well as information about their care processes and data-gathering techniques. Their innovative approaches are reducing hospital readmissions; improving patient safety, satisfaction, and engagement; and contributing to other positive outcomes. ","826":"In addition to providing high-quality care to vulnerable patient populations, home healthcare offers the least costly option for patients and the healthcare system, particularly in postacute care. As the baby boom generation ages, policymakers are expressing concerns about rising costs, variation in home healthcare service use, and program integrity. The Alliance for Home Health Quality and Innovation seeks to develop a research-based strategic framework for the future of home healthcare for older Americans and those with disabilities. This article describes the initiative and invites readers to provide comments and suggestions. ","827":"The ability of registered nurses to communicate well with their patients is foundational to patient-centered care, the management of chronic illness, and general healthcare. It is also vital to the nurse-patient relationship. Nurses, however, tend to identify with their patients' physical needs and rely heavily on the technical skills with which they feel more comfortable. This lack of ability to communicate well with their patients can result in poor nurse-patient understanding, can lead to poor patient outcomes, and a lack of patient engagement and involvement in their care. Motivational interviewing (MI), a patient-centered manner of communication, is a means to direct the nurse-patient interaction in a way that is patient centered. Brief education of MI has shown to be effective in increasing the self-efficacy of nurses in their ability to communicate well with their patients. In 2 geographically diverse Pennsylvania home care settings, MI education was provided to 20 nurses. The educational intervention was designed to increase the self-efficacy of nurses regarding their ability to affect the negative behaviors of chronically ill patients. A pretest and posttest was administered to the nurse participants to determine the effectiveness of the educational intervention. This evidence-based education increased the nurses' overall communication self-efficacy by 25%. ","828":"Pain is often undertreated and underreported in the elderly. Many of these individuals receive home healthcare services for management of their conditions. Home healthcare agencies (HHAs) have outcome measures that are publicly reported. The purpose of this project was to implement an evidence-based (EB) guideline bundle to improve the outcome measure \"Improvement in Pain Interfering With Activity.\" This quality improvement (QI) project used a pre-\/posttest design. The setting was a hospital-based HHA in Arizona. The target sample included Medicare patients with chronic pain and pain that interfered with activity. The approach included a review of published clinical practice guidelines addressing pain management, and identification of relevant interventions for the home healthcare setting. A bundle of three interventions was created for implementation. Clinical staff was educated on use of the bundle. Chart audits were conducted on patients meeting the inclusion criteria to determine if the bundle was used, and if the patient had an improvement in pain. There was a statistically significant improvement in the outcome \"pain interfering with activity\" in the patients who had the bundle (78% vs. 48%) used in their care (p = 0.007). Clinical staff readily incorporated use of the bundle into their practice, showing that implementation of an EB guideline bundle is an effective way to incorporate EB practices into the home healthcare setting.

As an advanced practice nurse, the CNS adds value by working with patients, home healthcare clinicians, and systems to improve patient outcomes. The CNS is a change agent who directly impacts the client during transitions in and out of home care, throughout the course of chronic disease management, and by assuring quality care is delivered by field clinicians. ","838":"The purpose of this exploratory pilot study was two-fold: (a) to determine the reliability of the instrument to measure nurses' knowledge of artificial nutrition and hydration, and (b) to assess home healthcare nurses' knowledge of artificial nutrition and hydration. A cross-sectional design was used to administer the questionnaire to 91 home healthcare nurses in North Carolina; 33 questionnaires were returned. Results revealed an accurate answer rate of 73% and Cronbach's alpha was 0.71, indicating adequate internal consistency reliability. ","839":"Self-neglect is a poorly understood phenomenon evident to home healthcare nurses who describe older adults who self-neglect as disheveled, unkempt individuals living in cluttered, filthy homes. In spite of the concerns nurses report about these individuals and their situations, individuals who self-neglect give no indication there is any reason for concern for their welfare, and in fact some refuse intervention. The purpose of this study was to determine how home healthcare nurses perceive elder self-neglect, their experiences with this phenomenon, and to explore the steps nurses take when self-neglect is suspected. ","840":"Nurses at 1 hospital-affiliated home healthcare agency (HHA) found that being a department of a Magnet-accredited hospital had a significant impact on the culture of their HHA. Important lessons were learned in conjunction with the Magnet designation journey. In this article, the authors describe the history of the Magnet recognition program, the components of the Magnet model, and how these are applicable to nursing practice within HHAs. ","841":"Technology holds potential to improve the quality of healthcare delivery. The use of remote patient monitoring, or telehealth (TH), has been widely adopted by many home care agencies to facilitate early identification of disease exacerbation, particularly for patients with chronic diseases such as heart failure. TH has been successfully used to improve symptom detection and potentially reduce rehospitalization rates. Quantifying program effectiveness through data analysis is a critical step for program improvement, resource allocation, and future strategic planning. Using the Outcome and Assessment Information Set-C database, a retrospective analysis was conducted examining 22 months of heart failure patient data from one home care agency in southern California. Seventy patients receiving TH were compared to patients who received usual home care nursing services. No major differences in baseline socio-demographics were found between the 2 groups. While receiving home healthcare services, the non-TH patients had a 21% all-cause hospital readmission rate, compared to the home TH patients with a 10% all-cause readmission rate. Statistical differences were found between groups on the variables of fall risk, vision, smoking, shortness of breath, the ability to bathe and take oral meds, along with having been discharged from a skilled nursing facility in the last 2 weeks. These results indicate that aggregate data analysis is useful in providing insight into program effectiveness. This study suggests TH programs have the potential to reduce the burden associated with rehospitalizations in the heart failure population.","842":"As the number of people older than 65 years in the United States increases, the home care population will increase as well. Many of these patients will have several chronic diseases, including those related to vision loss. Home healthcare clinicians are in a position to promote patient safety by educating these patients about the devices available for those with decreased vision. This article provides guidance on the most appropriate methods for communicating with patients who have limited vision. The 4 major causes of vision loss in this population are briefly reviewed. Low-vision aids are described and sources for these products are identified.
