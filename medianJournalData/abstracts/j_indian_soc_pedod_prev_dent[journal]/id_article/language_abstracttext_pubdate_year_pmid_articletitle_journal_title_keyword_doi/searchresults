rising trends in research and scientific writing, various ethical organizations have been vigilant over developing rigorous authorship criteria. There may be times, when authors tend to publish more due to their seniority or previously earned credit for former publications, proving the existence of Matthew effect in scientific research. It indicates that the majority of publications in a field are contributed by smaller number of authors. It was hypothesized that the Matthew effect may be still applicable for scientific work published by Indian pediatric dentists in the official Journal of Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry (JISPPD) from 2015 to 2019. To assess the number of times each author has published in the official Journal of Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, we downloaded all issues for the 5-year period from the journal website. Full names of all authors were entered year-wise in Microsoft Excel 2007 and descriptive statistics were used for finding out contribution percentages. A total of 372 papers were published during the study period by 1148 authors. About 82% had at least one publication, followed by 12% publishing at least two papers; only 1% of the total authors had contributed to more than five publications. The result showed the absence of Matthew effect for publications in the JISPPD. The final results of the study did not show any presence of Matthew effect among authorship in the JISPPD. ","1":"A 15-year-old patient reported persistent pain in the left mandibular second premolar (#35) following a traumatic bite 3 months ago. Clinical examination revealed a fractured central cusp suggestive of dens evaginatus. Intraoral periapical radiograph revealed an immature permanent tooth with a periapical radiolucency. A diagnosis of pulp necrosis with symptomatic apical periodontitis was made. The tooth was treated according to the revised guidelines of regenerative endodontic procedure by the American Association of Endodontics. The follow-up evaluation revealed a complete resolution of periapical pathology. A detached radiopaque tissue was appreciated at the 12-month follow-up. It resembled a broken root tip at the 24-month follow-up. Both the main root body and disjointed root tip developed independently. A cone-beam computed tomography evaluation at the 36-month follow-up confirmed the segmented development of the apical root tip.","2":"Talon's cusp, a type of dens evaginatus (DE) in a primary tooth, is a rare odontogenic anomaly which is reported sparingly in the literature. We report this case describing the presence of a talon's cusp on the right primary maxillary central incisor in a 2-year-old boy precipitating discomfort, owing to occlusal interference. The treatment plan involved pulpectomy and reduction of the lingula DE extension under general anesthesia.","3":"Oral swellings and ulcers in neonates are a spectrum of diseases often creating a sense of anxiety among parents. Early detection, high index of suspicion, proper investigations, and prompt diagnosis can aid in accurate management of the same. Lymphangiomas are benign hamartomas which are basically malformed lymphatics do not drain into other lymphatics or veins and hence there is lymphatic accumulation and enlargement following cystically dilated spaces. We hereby present a rare case of a neonate born with a cystic mucosal swelling at the upper gingival sulcus since birth.","4":null,"5":"The ongoing pandemic has affected all the spheres of life and one of the severely affected avenues is the education of a child. The online education has seen an upward curve since the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Schools globally have adopted online class tutorials as the main method to impart education and directly increasing the screen time for a child. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytological effects of prolonged mobile phone usage on the buccal mucosa of children. Stratified sampling was used for the selection of subjects for the study. After a questionnaire regarding the usage of a mobile phone was distributed among the parents of children. Among them, 90 children were selected on the basis of pattern and frequency of mobile phone usage in the child. The children were divided into three groups based on the per day hours of viewing of mobile phone, i.e., Group 1: Usage of 1-2 h a day, Group 2: Usage of 3-6 h a day, and Group 3: Usage of &gt;6 h a day. The time frame taken into consideration was 1 year after the pandemic started. This was specifically to understand the impact of the online education. Swab was obtained by using the conventional ice-cream stick method from the buccal mucosa. The samples were subjected to histological and microscopical analysis to observe for cytological changes. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the statistical significance if any. The results obtained clearly showed that Group 3 (&gt;6 h usage per day) showed the highest number of cellular and chromosomal aberrations which was significant. The results indicated that impact due to the prolonged screen time on the buccal mucosa is significant. A direct proportionality was seen between the apoptotic changes and chromosomal aberrations and the number of daily hour usage. ","6":null,"7":null,"8":"The study was planned to develop and validate a novel middle childhood oral health impact scale (MCOHIS) for 6- to 9-year-old children in India. A cross-sectional study design was employed to develop and validate MCOHIS in the sequential phases. A panel of ten pediatric dentists evaluated a pool of 36 items corresponding to the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of children. MCOHIS with 20 items under five domains was formulated and content validation was done. Cohen's kappa statistics was employed to measure the concordance between the child's self-report and the caregiver's proxy report. Concurrent validation was done among 130 participants from 13 districts of Tamil Nadu state, India. Discriminant validity was checked among another sample of 60 participants. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability of MCOHIS were assessed using Cronbach's alpha and Kappa statistics respectively. MCOHIS had adequate content validation with Scale Level Content Validity Index \/ Average score of 0.94 for relevance. There was a statistically significant inter-rater reliability observed between the child's self-report and caregivers' proxy report in all items with a moderate to substantial agreement. Concurrent validation showed a statistically significant positive correlation with a Rho value of 0.712. There was a statistically significant difference noted in overall discriminant validity (P &lt; 0.001). Acceptable internal consistency reliability was observed with Cronbach's alpha value of 0.75. Test-retest reliability showed a high stability coefficient of 0.98. MCOHIS was found to be a valid and reliable age-specific tool for assessing the OHRQoL of Indian children aged 6-9 years. ","9":"Mouth breathing is one of the most deleterious oral habits with a prevalence of 4%-6% among children. Due to the wide range of comorbidities associated with mouth breathing, early diagnosis and prompt treatment is indispensable. At present, there are very few objective methods available for the diagnosis of mouth breathing. The present study was planned to evaluate a possible correlation between nasal index (NI) and nasal cavity volume (NCV) among nasal and mouth breathers (MB). In addition, the average NCV of nasal and MB was also computed. The foresight of this research was to establish the significance of NI as an objective diagnostic tool for mouth breathing. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 8-11-year-old children. The NI was determined using a digital Vernier caliper and NCV was calculated using dolphin imaging. There was a significant difference in NCV and nasal width (NW) in both groups, but no difference was seen in nasal height and NI. There was no statistically significant correlation between NCV and other parameters in both groups. The present study was a baseline analysis in this line. Even though this study did not reveal any significant correlation between both parameters, future studies are recommended to explore a plausible correlation. ","10":"Age is one of the essential factors, which plays an important role in every aspect of life. Age is estimated on the basis of chronological age, bone age, dental age, mental age and others. This study represents the objective of an ideal age estimation technique to arrive at an age as close to the chronological age as possible. The aim of this comparative study was to estimate the dental age using Willems method by assessing the developmental stages of left seven permanent mandibular teeth in 7-14 years of age groups with the help of digital orthopantomogram and comparing it with Demirjian's method to conclude which method was more appropriate and better in Indian population of Uttarakhand region. A total of 100 digital orthopantomogram films of patients in the age group of 7-14 years was collected over the study period of 3 years from July 2014 to January 2017 and was equally distributed by convenience sampling. Group I included 50 boys and Group II included 50 girls aging 7-14 years of age (as permanent 7 teeth in the 3rd quadrant were to be assessed and scored according to the Demirjian's table, the 7-14 age group was selected). The date of birth of the subject was documented against their allocated identification number. Dental age according to Willem's method was calculated using Willem's table and Demirjian and Goldstein's table scores were used to calculate dental age by Demirjian's method. Willems method was more accurate and better than Demirjian's method as it showed less mean percentage error, i.e., 0.34% as compared to 15.94% obtained from Demirjian's method in Group II and 2.19% as compared to 8.05% obtained from Demirjian's method in Group I. The results suggested that Willems method of dental age estimation was an effective method of age estimation and was better and more accurate than Demirjian's method. ","11":"Early childhood caries is a multifactorial disease process affecting children below 71 months of age and continues to be a global health problem. Stainless steel crowns (SSCs) are widely used and are very popular in pediatric dentistry due to its superiority and durability when compared with multisurface amalgam restorations. However, one of the major disadvantages with these crowns is the poor esthetics. Parents often request for a more esthetic alternative to the SSC. Zirconia crowns are one of the tooth-colored full crown restorations currently available for use in primary teeth. These are available as both preformed and custom-made crowns and show excellent esthetics. However, these require extensive tooth preparation with a subgingival finish lines, which would cause gingival trauma and bleeding during the preparation. The present study uses intraoral scanners for making the custom-made zirconia crowns, which will avoid the conventional impressions. Currently, there are no studies available in pediatric dentistry regarding CAD-CAM crowns. Hence, there is a need for the study. The aim of this study is to clinically evaluate the performance of preformed SSCs and custom-made zirconia crowns in primary molars. To elicit parental and patient satisfaction with respect to preformed SSCs and custom made zirconia crowns and to radiographically compare the interproximal bone height for 1 year. The patients were selected with purposive sampling. The tooth of interest was prepared according to the crown it would receive. The upper and the lower arch of the tooth receiving custom-made zirconia crown was scanned using an intraoral scanner. The crowns were cemented using Type 1 glass ionomer cement (GIC) (SSC) and resin modified GIC (custom-made zirconia crown). After the crown placement, the patient and the parent's satisfaction was scaled regarding the time taken, comfort, cost of crown, appearance of crown, etc., using a 5-point Likert scale. A baseline radiograph was taken after crown placement. The patient was recalled every 3 months till 1 year for evaluation (loss of retention, loss of proximal contact, gingival inflammation, opposing tooth wear, and marginal integrity). At the end of 1 year, radiographs were taken to check the interproximal bone. After 1 year evaluation of custom-made zirconia crowns and preformed SSCs in primary molars, it was shown that both SSC and zirconia crowns showed good gingival scores but zirconia crown was better than SSC in improving the gingival health. SSCs showed better results with respect to the opposing tooth wear and marginal adaptability. Parents as well as patients preferred a tooth-colored crown as a treatment option. Custom-made zirconia crowns are comparable to the preformed SSCs and they show better gingival scores and excellent color match. ","12":"Dental caries begins with the initiation of demineralization which is a reversible process. Diet, especially intake of sugar, is an important aetiological factor for demineralization of enamel which eventually leads to caries. This study aims to understand the quantitative relationship between sugar consumption and mineralization by finding out the change in mineralization of teeth as a result of the change in the sugar score. This interventional study was done among 119 teeth of 19 subjects who were between the ages of 13-15 years in Hubli city. Sugar score was calculated from a 5-day diet history of the subjects and a DIAGNOdent pen was used to indicate the mineralization value of the teeth before the intervention. Diet counseling was given as an intervention after which sugar score and DIAGNOdent scores were measured again after 14 days and compared with the baseline values. Descriptive statistics and a linear regression analysis was done to determine the relationship between the variables. Sugar score and DIAGNOdent score after 14 days were found to have reduced significantly by 41.6% and 20.3% respectively from the baseline values. The Linear Regression indicated that a reduction of sugar score by 5 resulted in a decrease of DIAGNOdent score by 0.16. The findings of the present study suggest that the modification of sugar consumption brought about a significant improvement in the mineralization of the demineralized teeth thus making diet counseling an effective preventive strategy for caries prevention. ","13":"Restoring a proximal lesion in primary tooth has met with many challenges which has led to evolution of many materials. An alternative to Glass Ionomer Cements which has fluoride releasing capacity, offers good bond strength and is esthetic have been long looked for. This study aimed to compare the clinical performance of GIC and Cention N in proximal restorations of primary molars. A prospective study was conducted on 154 primary molars in patients aged between 5 and 8 years using a split-mouth design. Patients were divided into two groups. Control group restored with GIC and study group received Cention N. Both groups were assessed at baseline 3, 6 and 9 months according to Ryge criteria and data was statistically analysed using Fisher's Exact. Statistically significant difference was found between GIC and Cention N restorations for color match at baseline and color stability at 3 months (P &lt; 0.001), while the other parameters did not show any significant difference among the two restorative materials. Cention N can be used as a suitable alternative to GIC for restoring Class II restorations in primary molars. ","14":"Prevention of dental caries is important for nutrition and health of the child. Sucrose being considered an arch criminal, various substitutes are recommended. Xylitol is an artificial sweetener which cannot be metabolized by bacteria. Thus, it seems to be a promising method in prevention of dental caries. Fifty children between the age of 3-6 years were randomly divided into two groups; Group 1: Control group (without lollipops) and Group 2: Experimental group (with sugar substitute lollipops). The saliva sample was collected at four different time intervals, and pH of saliva was determined using universal pH indicator. There was a significant drop in the pH after drinking sweetened beverages in both the groups, but there was a significant rise in pH after having xylitol + erythritol lollipops which almost returned to baseline after 15 min. Lollipops containing xylitol and erythritol can be used in small children and it has potential to increase salivary pH, thus not allowing the pH to fall below the critical value. ","15":"This study aimed to systematically review available literature of in vitro studies on apical extrusion of debris through rotary instrumentation in comparison to manual instrumentation in pediatric endodontics, and also to perform a comparison between various rotary instrumentation systems for assessment of debris extrusion. A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar without any language restriction and year of publication. A planned search strategy was made for PubMed and applied to other databases. After full-text reading, 7 articles were selected for quantitative synthesis. Modified CONSORT checklist of items for reporting in vitro studies of dental materials was used for quality assessment of included studies. Root canal preparation with rotary instrumentation led to lesser apical debris extrusion than manual instrumentation. Self-adjusting file system was associated with the least debris extrusion among all included studies, followed by ProTaper Next, Kedo-S, ProTaper, K3, Mtwo, Revo-S, and Wave One. More apical debris extrusion was seen with manual instrumentation than rotary instrumentation. Furtrhermore, variance in debris extrusion was seen with different rotary file systems. ","16":"Sports injuries are a growing concern which requires immediate attention. Dental injuries are the most common type of orofacial injuries sustained during sports activities. This study aims to review the prevalence of sports-related facial trauma in India, to identify the most common types of oro-facial injury incurred due to sports, and to assess the level of awareness regarding preventive measures used in sports. The present review was performed in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. All articles published from 2005 to 2019 on sports-related facial trauma were analyzed. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane reviews databases were searched using primary keywords. A total of 24 articles published in the period of 2005-2019 were included. The prevalence of sports-related facial trauma was found to be the highest in the study conducted by Selva et al., in 2018, at a rate of 75%, whereas it was found to be minimal in the study conducted by Bali et al. in 2013. While the awareness of mouthguards was reported the highest in a study conducted by Ramagoni et al., in 2007. This study shows that there is a definite need to improve the awareness as well as the usage of protective gear, from the level of schooling, where children are introduced to sports. Prevention of sports-related facial trauma is essential to avoid the serious and lifelong consequences which could be the aftermath of such injuries.

There was a significant difference in debris index, calculus index, OHI-S\/OHIS-M, plaque index, and Oratest after intervention (P &lt; 0.05). Empowering Anganwadi and ASHA workers can be a feasible approach in India, where oral health is not a priority in primary health care as yet. ","21":"During the past decade, parental involvement for the selection of full coronal restorations for the primary anterior teeth of their children has been increased. Two most common anterior aesthetic full coronal restorations, the strip crowns and the preformed zirconia crowns, are available options. The aim of this study is to compare parental satisfaction with strip crowns and preformed primary anterior zirconia crowns over 1 year in 3-5 years old children. Forty maxillary primary incisors were restored by either strip crown or zirconia crown in 24 children. Permuted block randomization method was used for the allocation of participants. Twenty-four parents participated were recalled to fill the questionnaire over 1 year. One parent dropped out at the end of 1 year. Data were analyzed using the t-test and Chi-square test. P &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant. Parents were satisfied with both types of restorations. Statistically significant relationship was found between overall satisfaction and durability (P = 0.004) with strip crowns and with the color (P = 0.043) in the zirconia crowns. The parents with the lower satisfaction levels with the durability of strip crowns and color of zirconia crowns rated high overall satisfaction. Parental overall satisfaction was higher for preformed primary anterior zirconia crowns than strip crowns. Almost equal number of parents was satisfied with all other parameters except for durability, which was more for zirconia crowns.

This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the anesthetic efficacy of 4% articaine buccal infiltration with 2% lignocaine inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) for primary mandibular molar extractions. The study was a prospective, split-mouth, randomized controlled trial. Bilateral symmetrical carious primary mandibular molar (n = 92) extractions in 46 healthy children aged 5-10 years were included in this randomized controlled trial. Extraction was performed on one side using 4% of articaine buccal infiltration and on the contralateral side using 2% lignocaine IANB in two subsequent appointments. Pain and behavior were assessed at baseline, during injection and extraction using Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, Modified Behavior Pain Scale (MBPS), and Frankl Behavior Rating Scale. Values thus obtained were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance test and compared using independent samples test. According to MBPS, the mean value of pain experienced in the form of cry during injection was reported to be more for 2% lignocaine IANB (1.76) as compared to 4% articaine buccal infiltration (1.30), which was statistically significant (P = 0.024). Comparison of behavior depicted showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. Buccal infiltration with 4% articaine can be utilized as an effective alternative to 2% lignocaine IANB for primary mandibular molar extractions. ","24":"Saliva being an important biological fluid of our body contains both specific and nonspecific protective factors which form an integral part of our immune system. Salivary proteins play a substantial role in protecting humans against infection. Their level in oral cavity is subject to constant variations which is dependent on various factors. The purpose of the study was to compare the levels of salivary proline-rich proteins (PRPs), glycoproteins, amylase bands, and salivary pH in children with early childhood caries before and after treatment using gel electrophoresis. The whole salivary pH, mean protein concentrations, and electrophoretic profiles of the salivary proteins were measured using sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in both pre- and posttreatment groups. Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15.0 software. Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to further compare the results. The results were statistically significant in all the groups. There was variation in pre- and posttreatment values seen. Salivary proteins (glycoproteins, PRPs, and amylase) establish an imperative defense mechanism as antimicrobial agents.

Protocols for the use of rotary systems in primary molars are not well established. The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare root canal shape and area after ProTaper and K3 rotary instrumentation in primary molars. Coronal access cavities with straight-line access into the root canals were prepared on primary mandibular molar teeth, extracted for therapeutic reasons. The teeth were aligned in a prefabricated template in individual self-cure acrylic blocks such that their respective positions could be reproduced later. Forty-two primary mandibular molar teeth selected were equally divided into three groups: instruments with stainless-steel (SS) hand K-files, ProTaper, and K3 Endo rotary system. Precomputed tomography (CT) slices were taken at predetermined levels (coronal, middle, and apical third) followed by instrumentation of canals using selected files and post-CT scan. Data obtained were evaluated using independent t-test with a 0.05 level of significance and ANOVA. SS hand K-files and rotary ProTaper and K3 Endo of 0.04 taper produced a predominantly round shape at coronal, middle, and apical levels. ProTaper system caused the greatest increase in round-shaped canals and canal area followed by K3 Endo of 0.04 taper. Shaping abilities of both manual and rotary instrumentation systems in primary molars were similar, whereas for enlarging and maintaining anatomy, rotary systems (ProTaper and K3) were better. ","27":"Composites are the widely used restorative materials, and over the year, newer restorative composites have been introduced to eliminate the drawbacks of previous ones. The recent advance in restorative dentistry is bioactive restorative materials. However, bacterial plaque formation on these restorations is the primary reason for secondary caries. The purpose of this study was to do the comparative evaluation of bioactive restorative composites (Beautifil Flow Plus, Activa BioACTIVE, and Filtek Z250 XT as control) for their antibacterial efficacy under in vitro conditions. Thirty material blocks were used for this evaluation. Antibacterial efficacy was checked against Streptococcus mutans and observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results showed that Activa BioACTIVE shows maximum number of dead bacteria on the material surface compared to other groups. It can be concluded as it has maximum antibacterial efficacy among tested materials. ","28":"Fragment re-attachment has been considered as one of the treatment modalities for the management of fractured anterior teeth. Hydration of fractured fragments aids in inhibiting the loss of ions and maintains vitality and esthetics. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of preconditioning the fractured fragments with remineralizing agents on fracture resistance of re-attached teeth. This was an in vitro study. Sixty freshly extracted noncarious human permanent maxillary central and lateral incisors were randomly allocated into three Groups of 20 each: Group 1: 2% sodium fluoride (2%NaF), Group 2: casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), and Group 3: self-assembling peptide P11-4 (SAP). These were further divided into two subgroups of 10 teeth each, based on contact time with remineralizing agents, i.e., 30 min and 2 h. Fractured fragments were treated with remineralizing agents for a specified contact time and then re-attached with flowable composite resin. Force required to fracture the re-attached tooth was recorded in Newtons using universal testing machine. Unpaired t-test, one-way analysis of variance test, and post hoc Tukey test were used for the statistical analysis. A higher fracture resistance was noticed in fragments treated with 2% NaF (30 min- 215.6 N, 2 h- 188.5 N) compared to CPP-ACP (30 min- 141.3 N, 2 h- 111.1 N) and SAP (30 min- 134.8 N, 2 h- 149.5 N). At 30 min interval, it was found to be more in 2% NaF and CPP-ACP groups compared to 2 h. However, it increased with time in the SAP group. A statistically significant difference was found between the groups at both time intervals (P = 0.007 and 0.017). Preconditioning of fractured coronal fragments with 2% NaF showed higher fracture resistance compared to CPP-ACP and self-assembling peptide P11-4. Samples treated with SAP P11-4 exhibited good fracture resistance at 2 h contact time. ","29":"Problematic eating behavior pattern prevalent in children can be a potential risk factor for Early Childhood Caries (ECC). Pediatric dentist must be vigilant to enquire about eating behavior pattern and guide parents comprehensively. The aim of this study is to find the association between problematic ECC among 36-71-month-old children. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2000 children from both the sex and various socioeconomic backgrounds. A questionnaire was made to assess the personal information and problematic eating behavior of the child using Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) which was filled by parents. Clinical examinations were performed on the date of questionnaire collection and caries diagnosis was done in the dentition status part of \"WHO oral health assessment form 2013.\" The software used for the statistical analysis was SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) software version 16.0. The prevalence of ECC in the study sample was 42.6%. Out of eight domains into which problematic eating behavior was divided, domains Emotional Overeating (EOE), Satiety Responsiveness (SR), Slowness of Eating (SE), Desire to Drink, Food Fussiness, and Emotional Under eating were significantly associated with ECC. There is a positive correlation between problematic eating behavior and ECC; such behavior should be recognized at early stages and interrupted so that the risk of developing caries in permanent dentition could be prevented.

Recently, simvastatin which is a cholesterol-lowering drug has been found to be associated with the pulp regenerative potential. The aim of this parallel two-arm randomized control trial was to evaluate and compare the clinical and radiographic efficacy of diode laser (DL) and simvastatin gel (SG) in pulpotomy of carious primary molars. Hundred primary molars (in 98 children, 65 males, 33 females with age 4-8 years) requiring pulpotomy were randomized into the DL or SG group. Pulpotomy was performed as per the standardized protocol; thereafter, all teeth were restored with resin modified glass ionomer cement followed by stainless steel crowns. Follow-up evaluations were done at 3 and 12 months using clinical and radiographic criteria. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test at a significance level of 0.05. At 12 months, out of 92 teeth available for clinical and radiographic evaluation by blinded evaluators, DL group showed clinical and radiographic success rates of 76.1% and 52.1%, while SG group showed 80.4% and 65.2% success rates, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the efficacy of two techniques clinically (P = 0.49) or radiographically (P = 0.30). Both SG and DL had similar efficacy for primary tooth pulpotomy, clinically and radiographically after 12 months. Considering its ease of application and low-cost, SG can be recommended as a potential pulpotomy medicament in primary molars.

Sleep problems have been increasing over the past few years. However, there is a gap regarding information about sleep practices and sleep problems among Indian children. A sleep questionnaire was designed and validated to assess the frequency of sleep practices and sleep problems in 500 children. The study was conducted in 5 local schools in South Kanara district by administering the questionnaire to the parents\/caretakers under the guidance of a trained investigator. We also sought to examine the association of demographics, medical\/behavior\/academic performance, sleep patterns, and home environment to sleep problems in these children. Descriptive statistics were recorded as mean and standard deviation for quantitative data and in frequency and percentage for qualitative data. We found a high prevalence of bedroom sharing (92.4%) and bed-sharing (91.2%). 46.4% of the children exhibited at least one sleep problem, the most prevalent being bed-wetting (17%). Sleep problems were considerably greater in older children and in children with behavioral problems. Practices such as watching TV and using computer after 8 pm\/at bedtime were significantly associated with all sleep problems.

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and severity of MIH in children residing in urban and rural areas of Puno, Peru. This was an observational cross-sectional study that included 404 children, aged 7-10 years old, from urban and rural public schools in Puno, Peru. A previously calibrated examiner established the MIH diagnosis based on the index that integrates the criteria of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry and the modified index of developmental defects of enamel (mDDE index), as well as the caries experience based on the DMFT index. The information was analyzed using descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis. Eighty children (19.8%) presented MIH, and the prevalence was higher in the urban area. Demarcated opacities were the most prevalent type of lesion (52.1%), followed by atypical caries lesions (36.7%). The more severe the defects, the greater their extent. Similarly, the greater the extent of tooth defects, the greater the number of teeth affected per child. Children with MIH had slightly higher rates of tooth decay experience (DMFT). However, no significant association was found between caries experience and MIH. The population studied showed a high prevalence of MIH, similar to other studies in South American populations. The prevalence varied among residence areas, being more prevalent in the urban area. Mild lesions were more frequent.

A child's cooperation with a dental.procedure.usually requires various behavioral management strategies conveyed by the entire dental team. The use of sedatives in dental clinics for providing analgesia and anxiolysis allows the patient to respond appropriately to verbal commands and light tactile stimulation., thus making dental treatment more patient friendly and effective. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine versus midazolam for the management of pediatric patients in the dental clinic. This systematic review was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Six articles were selected for this systematic review. Of them, only in four articles, homogeneous data were available which were subjected to meta-analysis. When compared with midazolam, premedication with dexmedetomidine resulted in much lower incidence of emergence delirium (odds ratio = 0.07, 95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.54, P = 0.01). No significant difference was observed with respect to satisfactory behavior of the child, successful parental separation, and satisfactory mask acceptance following sedation. Both dexmedetomidine and midazolam are equally effective for the management of pediatric patients in the dental clinic. In addition, dexmedetomidine premedication is associated with lower incidence of emergence delirium and has a better margin of safety.

The present study was conducted to test the validity of BU approach by comparing it with Tanaka-Johnston (T\/J) approach in the contemporary population. The aim of the study was to determine the applicability of BU approach for prediction of the MDWs of canines and premolars in the primary schoolchildren of rural Bengaluru. The study was conducted in 100 healthy schoolchildren of rural Bengaluru aged between 7 and 11 years. The MDWs of canines and premolars were predicted using both T\/J and the considered BU approaches for all the children and were compared. The correlation coefficient showed a statistically significant correlation between the predicted tooth size from the two predicted methods in the upper and lower arches (P &lt; 0.001), with Pearson's correlation coefficient showing the very strong positive relationship (r = 0.7). Significant differences were seen between the mean predicted width of canines and premolars by both the approaches (P &lt; 0.001).

Maternal stress and child's temperament, as predictors of child behavior, are among factors that may be associated with ECC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the salivary cortisol level of mothers as an indicator of maternal stress, child's temperament, and ECC. Ninety preschool children, who were divided into three groups of ECC, severe ECC (S-ECC), and caries-free (CF), were included in this study, as well as their mothers with no history of anxiety disorders. The salivary cortisol levels of mothers were analyzed using ELISA assay. Children were examined for the evidence of caries, using the decayed-missing-filled teeth index, based on the World Health Organization standard criteria. Child temperament was also assessed, using Cloninger's Preschool Temperament and Character Inventory, consisting of seven significant factors (cooperativeness, harm avoidance, novelty seeking, reward dependence, persistence, self-directing, and self-transcendence). The association between the salivary cortisol level of mothers and temperament of children with S-ECC was positive although it was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). Of seven temperament factors, only harm avoidance was significantly different between the CF and S-ECC groups (P = 0.016). Maternal stress and child's temperament were not associated with ECC.

This case-control study involved 200 children, aged 3-5 years with an equal number of cases (with ECC) and controls (without ECC), based on the WHO-decay-missing-filled teeth index criteria for dental caries. The data for parental food choice motives and attitudes toward sugar consumption were obtained using questionnaire answered by their parents, and the dietary sugar exposure was calculated using a 24 h diet chart. Data were analyzed with multiple logistic regression. Most parents (99.5%) considered \"maintaining health and nutrition\" as an important criterion, above 85% parents thought \"mood of the child,\" \"child likes and dislikes,\" \"sensory appeal of the food item,\" \"natural foods,\" \"quality of the food,\" and \"weight control\" criteria important while selecting food items, with no significant difference between cases and controls. About 61% of the cases considered buying food based on convenience is important, as compared to 47% controls, and the difference was significant. Cases and controls did not differ in attitudes toward sugar consumption. Sugar exposure was significantly higher among the cases. High dietary sugar exposure is associated with ECC.

Effective plaque control in young children can be achieved with twice-daily assisted tooth brushing. Self-efficacy relates to one's confidence in performing a task. Self-efficacy is shown to facilitate the behavior change in treatments for lifestyle diseases. The influence of maternal self-efficacy in children's oral health behaviors is less studied. The aim of this study is to evaluate an association between maternal tooth brushing-related self-efficacy (MTBSE) and child's brushing adherence. This cross-sectional study was conducted in schools and included 781 mother-child dyads with children between the age group of 2 and 6 years. Selected mothers were asked to complete the questionnaires on sociodemographic data, mother's oral health knowledge (MOHK), tooth-brushing practices, and MTBSE. Brushing adherence was evaluated as complete adherence if the child followed twice daily assisted brushing using the toothbrush and toothpaste. Nonparametric tests were used to compare the variables. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictors of brushing adherence. Complete brushing adherence (assisted brushing with toothbrush and toothpaste at least twice per day) was seen only in 26.9% children. More children with complete brushing adherence were single children (P &lt; 0.001). Children with complete brushing adherence had mothers with significantly higher MTBSE (P &lt; 0.001). The presence\/absence of siblings, MOHK, and MTBSE were found to be strong and significant predictors of brushing adherence in children.

Due to the high transmissibility of the COVID virus and the associated morbidity and mortality, various International and National health authorities released different guidelines for day-to-day living, laying down \"new norms\" which has impacted our lives enormously. Although these guidelines seem to be convoluted but owing to some differences in the guidelines, it raises an ambiguity in the minds of dentists. Hence, we felt the need of this review to summarize different guidelines issued by various National health authorities for catering emergency and routine dental care. We included guidelines from CDC, ADA, NHS, India, UAE, Egypt, and Tunisia and compared and consolidated to reach a consensus that teledentistry is a good alternative to face-to-face management for nonemergency patients. Triage should be done for all patients coming to the health-care facility. Temperature and other vital parameters should be recorded in our daily practice. Antibacterial mouth rinses before the dental procedure can reduce the microbial load and therefore can alleviate transmission. To reduce indirect transmission through fomites on inanimate objects various waiting area changes must be ensured. Air conditioners can be used in well-serviced conditions with due care given to ventilation of the operatory after each patient.

The literature review showed a scarcity of research data regarding the use of CSS,in teaching, especially in dentistry. The use of CSS in dental teaching was found restricted to the use of low fidelity typhodonts fitted to phantom heads used in teaching cavity preparation and crown cutting. The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of CSS using standardized patient in teaching behavior management and modification skills to dental undergraduate students. This double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was undertaken among 3rd year dental undergraduate students, and the study was undertaken at the Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry. Fifty, 3rd year BDS students were randomly allotted to simulation and nonsimulation groups. Baseline data regarding their knowledge in the behavior management of child patients were assessed. Simulation group was further divided into group of six students and underwent CSS with standardized patient. Pretest and posttest knowledge regarding behavior management was assessed in the simulation group using questionnaires approved by an expert committee. The results were analyzed to see if there is any improvement in their knowledge after CSS. Students in simulation and nonsimulation groups were assessed for their behavior management skills during patient management, by an independent observer, using a checklist. Mean, standard deviation (SD), and unpaired student t-test were done to assess the baseline knowledge of students who participated in the study. Mean, SD, and paired t-test were used to compare the pretest and posttest score of students who underwent simulation. Mean, SD, and unpaired t-test were used to compare the behavior management skills of both groups of students. The knowledge of students in both groups before the study was comparable with no statistically significant differences. There was a statistically significant improvement in the knowledge of students who underwent CSS regarding behavior management of child patients. The unpaired Student's t-test showed a significant difference in the behavior management skill of dental undergraduate students when treating a child patient. The students who underwent CSS fared better compared to students who were taught behavior management methods by traditional methods only. Clinical skill simulation using standardized patient is an effective adjunct to be used along with traditional method of teaching while teaching behavior management and modification skills to dental undergraduate students. ","84":"Early childhood caries (ECC) has been regarded as one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in children. Conventional restorative management of ECC is difficult to perform in very young and apprehensive children. Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) can be a useful tool in the management of dental caries by arresting the carious lesion in primary teeth. After SDF treatment, the dentinal staining that is associated with SDF influences the acceptance of this treatment among parents of young children. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of biannual application of 38% SDF followed by 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish for arresting dental caries in children and its parental acceptance. Twenty-six children aged 2-5 years with 107 active caries lesions in primary teeth were enrolled. At the baseline examination, status of carious lesions was recorded and scored according to the International Caries Detection and Assessment System II. Lesion activity was assessed by visual inspection and tactile detection. Carious lesions with score 3, 4, 5, and 6 were treated with 38%SDF application, followed by 5% NaF varnish. Children were re-evaluated at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Parental acceptance of SDF treatment was evaluated. This study demonstrated that 38% SDF was 92.31% effective in arresting dental caries in primary teeth and was well accepted by parents. Chi-square test was used to assess the significant difference among the arrested lesions which was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).

","130":"Controlling cariogenic biofilm formation by plant extracts could add to preventive strategies to dental caries. To evaluate in vitro the role of Aerva Sanguinolenta ethanolic extract on biofilm-induced microbial human enamel demineralization. The prepared enamel sections of study group (SG), positive control group (PCG), and negative control group (NCG) were immersed in 2 ml of 0.2% ethanolic extract of A. sanguinolenta, 0.12% chlorhexidine, and distilled water, respectively, for 2 min before subjecting to closed batch culture technique utilizing mono- or dual-species culture media of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Quantification of biofilm and demineralization of enamel was performed by crystal violet (CV) assay and scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached to energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, respectively. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test were used for analysis. CV assay of biofilm recorded the highest and lowest optical absorbance value in NC3 (2.728660) and PC3 (0.364200), respectively. Thus, biofilm formation is highest in NCG and lowest among PCG. Surface roughness and porosity in enamel are greatest among NCG and lowest among SG as evident by SEM. Wt% of calcium (S3 47.7170) and phosphorus ion (S3 22.7330) was highest in SG, closely resembling that of B enamel (Ca = 41.9530, P = 19.6650). Wt% of oxygen is lowest in SG (S3 28.8920) and resembles baseline O2 (37.4950). Thus, the amount of biofilm formation is moderate and amount of demineralization of enamel is least among SGs. Enamel exposed to 2 ml of 0.2% solution of A. sanguinolenta for 2 min could fairly inhibit formation of biofilm and positively inhibit underlying demineralization in cariogenic environment. ","131":"Dental trauma can determine the occurrence of sequelae in the deciduous tooth and due to the anatomical proximity to the germ of the successor permanent tooth, it frequently causes changes to the developing teeth. The objective of this study was to analyze clinically and radiographically traumatized primary teeth and permanent successors in children aged 0-8 years. Initially, a sample selection of medical records was made, designating the patients who fit the requirements; 247 patients were analyzed, totaling 379 traumatized primary teeth and 162 successive permanent teeth. The results were developed using the Proportion Test and the Chi-square test at the 5% significance level. Injuries to hard tissue prevailed (57%), with emphasis on coronary enamel fracture (49.1%). After clinical and radiographic examinations, 78% of traumatized primary teeth maintained pulpal vitality. At the clinical evaluation, the frequency of the developmental disorders observed in permanent successors was 10.5%, with enamel hypocalcification being the most common sequela. 17.3% of the clinical changes in the successor permanent teeth were caused by trauma to the supporting tissue, with the intrusive dislocation being responsible for the largest number of damages (37.5%). Based on the results found, it was concluded that the trauma occurring in the primary dentition were recorded and monitored more precisely and about the evaluated successive permanent teeth, except for the prevalence of sequelae found, the other factors are in agreement with the findings in the literature. ","132":"Dental anxiety and fear is not only a psychological problem but also a dental health problem. It is important to understand how the cognitive elements influence child's dental anxiety\/fear and interact with their oral health. This study was conducted among children to determine the association between cognitive vulnerability (CV) with dental fear and their oral health status. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 500 schoolchildren aged 12-15 years in Bengaluru city. The schools and participants were selected by cluster random and systematic random sampling method, respectively. Cognitive vulnerability and Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C+) were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire. Oral health status was recorded using the World Health Organization 2013 proforma for children. Chi-square test, Student's t-test, Spearman's correlation, and multivariate hierarchical linear regression were used in this study. The statistical significance was considered at P &lt; 0.05. Nearly half of the study participants had cognitive perceptions, dental anxiety\/fear, phobia, and stimulus toward dental treatment. Majority had dental caries and gingival bleeding. Cognitive vulnerability, dental anxiety\/fear, phobia, and stimulus were independent of the age and gender and were associated with socioeconomic status. A significant correlation was found between participants' CV, IDAF-4C+, dental caries, and gingival bleeding. Cognitive vulnerability was a significant predictor of dental caries and gingival bleeding. Dental anxiety\/fear and dental phobia were significant predictors of dental caries. Oral health status was significantly poorer and was associated with CV, dental anxiety\/fear, phobia, and stimulus. Cognitive elements together with dental fear influenced oral health. ","133":"According to the WHO, 16%-40% of children aged 6-12 years experience dental traumas. Long-term treatment success depends on immediate emergency care and early professional management after the injury occurred. The primary school teachers can play a crucial role in managing traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) because they are often in proximity to children and often need to assist when dental trauma occurs. The aim of the present study was to assess primary school teachers' knowledge and attitude regarding TDI and describe their behavior in emergency situations. A four-part anonymous questionnaire comprised questions on demographic data, attitude, knowledge toward TDI, and behavior in case of accident and self-assessment questions were distributed among 147 teachers from 16 schools. The data were obtained from 106 participants (72.1%). The Kruskal-Wallis and independent t-tests served for statistical analysis. More than half of teachers (56.6%) have witnessed TDI. Almost all respondents (94.3%) indicated that in case of dental trauma is important to take emergency management as soon as possible. However, two-thirds of them (75.5%) thought that teachers cannot provide appropriate emergency management in case of TDI. In addition, teachers had little knowledge regarding TDI and the proper emergency management: 91.3% of participants do not know the right storage media for the avulsed tooth, 40.6% have thought that tooth replantation is impossible, and 17.1% would throw an avulsed tooth away, when it fells on the ground. The study revealed inappropriate knowledge and attitude regarding TDI among primary school teachers and their behavior in first-aid management.

Aims: The aim of the study was to correlate Vitamin D level and eruption status of primary teeth. The objectives also included the assessment of the association between Vitamin D levels and socioeconomic status, infant's sun exposure, maternal sun exposure during pregnancy and religion. A cross-sectional, observational study conducted on 96 infants aged 12-15 months. Ninety-six infants, aged 12-15 months were selected after obtaining parental consent. Blood samples were assessed for Vitamin D3 levels using the Vitamin D ELISA Kit. The eruption status of the teeth was recorded in all the 96 infants. The obtained data were subjected to the statistical analysis. The obtained data were subjected to relevant statistical analysis such as Analysis of Variance, unpaired t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square Test, Tukey HSD, and Fisher's exact Test. Results: A significant correlation was found in the Vitamin D levels and the eruption timing (P &lt; 0.001). The difference in mean Vitamin D levels among the three socio economic groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.088). A significant association was found between the infant's sun exposure and mother's sun exposure during pregnancy and religion on the Vitamin D levels (P = 0.002, P = 0.042, P = 0.002). Vitamin D deficiency can be considered as an etiological factor for delayed eruption. A strong association exists between the socioeconomic status, infant's sun exposure, maternal sun exposure during pregnancy, and religion with Vitamin D levels.

Hence, the aim of the study was to compare the topical anesthetic efficiency of precooling with ice, clove-papaya based topical gel and benzocaine gel in pediatric patients. Sixty healthy children aged 9-10 years who required local anesthetic injections for dental procedures were selected and divided into three groups with 20 patients each. In the first visit, written consent and intraoral screening of the patients were performed. In the second visit, the topical anesthetic agents were applied in the respective groups for 1 min and later local anesthetic injections were administered. Pain perception was evaluated using Sound, Eye, Motor Scale (SEM scale) and Wong Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS), tabulated, and statistically analyzed. A. The test results demonstrated that benzocaine group has the highest mean WBFPRS score followed by clove-papaya group and then ice cone group. The ice group showed the least mean SEM scale score, followed by the benzocaine group and then clove-papaya group. However, the mean WBFPRS score and the mean SEM scale score did not show any statistically significant difference. All the three topical anesthetic agents provided similar surface anesthesia in children. The newly introduced clove-papaya based topical anesthetic gel showed encouraging results, hence can be used as a potent topical anesthetic agent.

The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a novel herbal anesthetic gel used as a topical anesthetic before an inferior alveolar nerve block. This was a bilateral split-mouth, single blind, crossoverin vivo study. Atotal number of 30 children were selected for this study design. After the application of the topical anesthesia, a 26-gauge needle was inserted in the mucobuccal fold and local anesthetic solution was deposited. Assessment of pain perception was done before the procedure and at the time of needle penetration using hemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate. The objective and subjective pain assessment was recoded through sound eye motor scale and Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). As the data followed a normal distribution, parametric tests were used to analyze these data. The independent sample t-test and paired sample t-test were used to check the mean differences. The data showed no statistically significant differences in the objective and subjective pain assessment values of the novel herbal anesthetic gel compared to the 2% lignocaine gel. However, the intragroup comparisons of the before and during treatment results showed statistically significant results (P &lt; 0.05). The novel herbal anesthetic gel was effective and safe in reducing the pain from needle insertion. Thus, setting up scientific evidence for the therapeutic usage of herbal products can, therefore, assist to develop a more efficient and alternative topical anesthetic.

Propolis, a natural product with proven antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties when mixed with zinc oxide powder as root canal filling material, it could provide good success in endodontic therapy of primary teeth. The aim was to evaluate and compare the clinical effectiveness of zinc oxide-propolis mixture with zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) as root canal filling material in nonvital primary molars. This was a 2-arm, parallel group randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment. Forty primary molars from children aged 4-8 years requiring pulpectomy treatment were randomly allocated into two groups according to the obturating material used: zinc oxide-propolis mixture (test group) and ZOE (control group). All the pulpectomy treated teeth were finally restored with stainless steel crowns, and the children were recalled at 6, 12, and 24 months for postoperative clinical and radiographic evaluation. Chi-square test was used to analyze the data. The overall success rate of pulpectomy with zinc oxide-propolis mixture and ZOE was found to be 95% and 70%, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.037). Zinc oxide-propolis mixture has shown a success rate of 100% at 6 months and 95% at 12 and 24 months follow-up, whereas ZOE has shown 80% success rate at 6 and 12 months, and it declined to 70% at 24-month follow-up. Zinc oxide-propolis mixture demonstrated good clinical and radiographic success at the end of 24 months, and hence, it can be considered as an alternate root canal filling material in the primary teeth. ","142":"Sodium hypochlorite, though considered an ideal root canal irrigant, cannot be used at required concentrations in children, due to its undesirable effects. Hence, it is imperative to search for an ideal root canal irrigant to avoid these undesirable effects which we hope to achieve with this study. The antimicrobial efficacy of aqueous ozone, green tea, and normal saline as irrigants in pulpectomy procedures of the primary teeth has been compared. Sixty patients between 4 and 8 years of age with a single-rooted deciduous tooth indicated for pulpectomy were included. The infected teeth were randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups based on the irrigating agents used, namely normal saline, green tea extract, or ozonated water. Specimens for anaerobic culture were collected three times from the teeth: before irrigation, after initial irrigation, and on the 3rd day after final irrigation. Mean colony forming unit (CFU) count after both initial and final irrigation with ozonated water was significantly lower when compared with green tea and normal saline. Further, it was observed that the mean CFU count with green tea was significantly lower than the counts obtained with normal saline on the 3rd day after final irrigation. Hence, both ozonated water and green tea could be considered a good alternative to conventional root canal irrigants in the primary teeth. Larger sample sizes with a larger variety of irrigants are recommended.

Material and Methods: Thirty sound single-rooted human teeth were distributed randomly and equally into three groups (n = 10 each) based upon the type of laser irradiation after RCP: Group I (control group) - RCP with ProTaper rotary system using the standard irrigating protocol; Group II - RCP with ProTaper rotary system using the standard irrigating protocol followed by diode laser irradiation; and Group III - RCP with ProTaper rotary system using the standard irrigating protocol followed by Er:YAG laser irradiation. After root sectioning, specimens were dehydrated, then gold plated and observed using a scanning electron microscopy. Then, the smear layer scores were recorded and performed using the statistical analysis. Results: Smear layer removal efficacy of Er:YAG laser was more at coronal, middle, and apical third when compared to Group I and Group II. Debris removal score of Group III (Er:YAG) was better than Group I (17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and Group II (diode). Conclusion: Er:YAG laser-activated RCP was comparatively efficient in cleaning the smear layer and dentinal tubules opening.","162":"The quest for ideal pulp capping materials has given rise to the development of newer materials such as light cure mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). The bond strength of the pulp capping materials with overlying restoration is one among the several factors that are critical for the success of vital pulp therapy. Hence, we conducted this study to evaluate and compare the shear bond strength (SBS) of light cure MTA and light cure calcium hydroxide with nanofilled composite. Thirty acrylic blocks each with a central hole were prepared to uniform dimensions and randomly distributed into two equal groups. In Group I, light cure MTA, and in Group II, light cure calcium hydroxide was used as pulp capping materials. After the application of adhesive system, nanofilled composites were applied onto the pulp capping material using a cylindrical plastic matrix. The SBS was tested on a universal testing machine (Instrom 3366, UK) at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm\/min. The samples were examined under stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope to analyze different modes of failure. The results were statistically analyzed using independent sample t-test. Light cure MTA attained the mean SBS of 6.54 MPa and light cure calcium hydroxide attained the mean SBS of 6.56 MPa. There was no significant difference statistically in SBS of both the materials (P &lt; 0.05). The modes of failure were predominantly mixed failure followed by cohesive failure within the restorative material in both Group I and II. The results of the study suggest that the SBS of light cure MTA and light cure calcium hydroxide is comparable. The modes of failure analyzed in both light cure MTA and light cure calcium hydroxide are not significantly different statistically. Hence, both materials can be successfully used as pulp capping material with nanofilled composite.

To evaluate and compare the amount of RDT during endodontic treatment using manual K-files and rotary Mtwo, ProTaper Next, and Hero shaper instruments. Anin vitro study was carried out on a sample of 100 freshly extracted human single straight rooted mandibular first premolar teeth. The teeth were divided into five groups of twenty each and mounted on wax rims for a preoperative cone beam computed tomography scan to calculate the dentin thickness 3 and 6 mm from the apex. All the teeth were treated according to their groups. The observations were then statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA to evaluate the difference among four groups followed by post hoc test for pairwise comparison. Maximum preservation of dentin was seen in Group V (cleaning and shaping done with rotary Hero shaper files) at 3 and 6 mm from the apex, whereas minimum preservation of dentin was seen in Group IV at 3 mm (cleaning and shaping done with rotary ProTaper Next files) and Group II at 6 mm (cleaning and shaping done with hand K-stainless steel files) from the apex. Overall there was a statistically significant difference in RDT values between Group V and Groups I, II, III, IV both at 3 and 6 mm from the apex. Cleaning and shaping with rotary Hero shaper files preserved more amount of dentin when compared to hand K-files, rotary Mtwo, ProTaper Next.

This study aims to correlate the dental anxiety of preschool children as shown during the doll placement test with that of their behavioral patterns during the first dental visit. This cross-sectional study was conducted between the ages of 3-7 years. During their first dental visit, the background variables were elicited from parent\/guardian at the reception desk. Later at the play area, the child was given a set of dolls representing dentist, child, and mother to place them in a model dental office having a dental chair. The child was then taken for the initial oral examination, during which the behavior of the child was rated using Frankl's Behavior Rating Scale. The data collected were analyzed using Chi-square test and binary regression analysis. The observed association between the doll placement pattern and the behavior of the patient during dental treatment was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). The binary regression analysis showed that the child's unpleasant previous medical and parent's unpleasant dental experiences had higher odds favoring uncooperative behavior (46.63 and 41.93, respectively). The child's behavior on the dental chair is associated with the doll placement pattern, which is also influenced by experiences of the child during his\/her encounter with the medical doctor and previous dental experiences of their parents.

To analyse the relationship between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the vitamin D receptor gene TaqI locus and associate its presence with dental caries in children. A case control study was conducted among 120 children in the age group of 6-12 years. 60 cases with a DMFT of &gt;3 and 60 controls with a DMFT of 0 were selected. Genomic DNA was extracted from salivary samples collected from the patients and presence of polymorphism was analyzed by PCR-RFLP. Pearson chi square test and Fisher exact tests were used for comparison of differences in genotypes or allele frequencies between groups. No significant difference between the cases and control was observed among the different genotypes and the alleles. However, there was an inclination in the incidence of caries with the genotype 'tt' and 'Tt' when compared with the genotype'TT'.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review to evaluate the retentive strength of luting cements for SSCs. Two reviewers performed a database search of the studies published from 2004 till date. The inclusion criteria were papers published in the English language andin vitro studies on retentive strength of SSC on primary molars. All potentially relevant studies were identified by the title and the abstract. After the full-text analysis, the selected studies were included in the systematic review. Sixteen nonduplicated studies were found. However, after reviewing the articles, only seven were included. Risk bias was assessed. Out of seven studies included in the systematic review, five studies presented medium risk of bias and two studies showed high risk of bias. Within the limitations of this study, thein vitro literature seems to suggest that the use of self-adhesive resin cements shows higher retentive strength, followed by resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RM-GIC) and conventional GIC. However, RM-GIC can be a preferred luting agent due to its clinical advantages over resin cements. Thus, it can be concluded that choice of cement will depend on individual patient needs and clinical situation.

This study aims to evaluate clinical and radiographic success of a mixture of zinc oxide and 10% sodium fluoride as root canal obturating material. This pilot study was conducted among 30 primary molars indicated for pulpectomy. Thirty grossly decayed primary molars of children aged 4-9 years were selected with signs or symptoms of irreversibly inflamed or degenerative pulp tissue. Single sitting pulpectomy was carried out in all the teeth with a mixture of zinc oxide powder with 10% sodium fluoride, and they were subsequently restored with preformed crown. Teeth were assessed clinically and radiographically at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals. Data were analyzed using SPSS Software Version 20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL, USA) and statistical significance was determined by Chi-square test; level of significance was set at P &lt; 0.05. Overall clinical and radiographic success rate of combination of zinc oxide and sodium fluoride was 92.9% and 85.7%, respectively, at the end of 12 months. Furthermore, resorption rate of material matched resorption of tooth root. Excess filling material was also observed to resorb at the end of 3 months.

Evidence shows that most young children acquire cariogenic organisms from their mothers. Poor maternal knowledge about oral diseases combined with inappropriate feeding can lead to severe caries among young children. The aim of study was to assess the oral health status of pregnant women and to evaluate the gain in their knowledge after educational session in an antenatal setting. It is a pre- and post-intervention study carried out on the pregnant women (n = 198) attending an antenatal clinic in a tertiary care hospital. A specially designed semi-structured 14-point questionnaire was used to assess the pre- and post-knowledge and attitude to the oral health. Each participant was educated for self and infant oral care with the help of a specially prepared colored printed booklet. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to explore the associations between the age, education and socioeconomic class and knowledge; Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre- and post-knowledge score. Median preoral health knowledge-attitude score was found to be 4 (0-8) and was found to be associated with the level of education (P = 0.014) and socioeconomic class (0.019). There was a significant improvement in the median postknowledge score to 7 (2-10) (P &lt; 0.001) following oral health educational session in all categories.

Resin-based materials for sealing pits and fissures (pit and fissure sealants and flowable composites) are helpful in caries control by physical barrier formation, which prevents metabolic exchange between fissure microorganisms and oral environment. Retention is one of the most important prerequisites for pit and fissure sealants. Debris and pellicle might not be removed by conventional prophylaxis and etching; therefore, air abrasion (AB) for fissure preparation has been advocated for sealant retention. This in vivo study was aimed to compare the retention of resin-based pit and fissure sealant to flowable resin composition occlusal pits and fissures of all first permanent molars with and without air-abrasion over a 12-month follow-up. A randomized controlled clinical trial was done after obtaining ethical committee approval and informed and written consent. Thirty children with the age of 6-9 years, with all four caries-free first permanent molars without any hypoplasia\/fracture but with pits and fissures prone to caries were included in this study. The four first molars were divided into the following four groups: Group A (tooth 16; sealant + AB), B (tooth 46; composite + AB), C (tooth 36; sealant), and D (tooth 26; composite). Assessments were made at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months for partial or total loss of sealant and caries according to Modified Simonsen's Criteria. Flowable composite was relatively better retained than sealant at 12 months' follow-up although results were statistically insignificant.

Researchers and authors frequently use the idiom \"hemangioma\" to portray or describe vascular malformations and a potpourri of vascular anomalies. Infantile hemangioma, a type of hemangioma, is one of the most common benign vascular tumors in infancy and childhood. As hemangioma could regress spontaneously, it generally does not require treatment unless proliferation interferes with normal function or gives rise to the risk of serious disfigurement and complications unlikely to resolve without treatment. Various methods for treating infant hemangiomas have been documented, including wait-and-see policy, laser therapy, drug therapy, sclerotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. However, none of these therapies can be used for all hemangiomas. Hence, to obtain the best treatment outcomes, the treatment protocol should be individualized as per the case.","210":"Preventive orthodontics is an aspect of pediatric dentistry, which requires a unique set of skills and understanding to aid the patient's treatment and properly align teeth. The safest way to prevent future malocclusions from tooth loss is to place a space maintainer (SM), which is advocated to hold the space until the eruption of permanent teeth. SM manufacturing is a laborious process that requires ample communication with the laboratory to properly complete and provide the patient with optimal results. Band and loop SM is mostly indicated for the premature loss of single primary molar, but this appliance has a number of limitations. Digital technology has resulted in decreasing human errors by automating the dental model fabricating process with three-dimensional printing. The current paper provides an insight of the use of this new technology in pediatric dentistry for manufacturing two types of SMs and a case report.","211":"The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare formocresol (FC) and 5% Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) as pulpotomy medicaments and to assess the histological features of both pulpotomy medicaments in primary teeth.

Maxillary protraction with expansion is the recommended treatment modality for deficient maxilla. Facemask is a conventional protraction appliance, and Maxgym is a new protraction appliance. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Maxgym with Facemask using finite-element analysis. A three-dimensional finite-element model consisting of 49,807 nodes and 185,620 tetrahedral-shaped elements was created using computed tomography scan of a patient with unilateral CLP. F1, F2, and F3 represent different protraction forces of facemask, and M1, M2, and M3 represent different protraction forces of Maxgym. E1 represents slow maxillary expansion (SME) force, and E2 represents rapid maxillary expansion (RME) force. Facemask and Maxgym forces were applied parallel to the occlusal plane from the middle of the clinical crown on the buccal side of the first premolars. The forces E1 and E2 were also applied on the middle of the crown height on the lingual side of the first premolars and the first molars to simulate expansion. The amount of displacement for Maxgym and Facemask forces in transverse direction was analyzed designating specific nodes to represent dental and skeletal structures. The dental and skeletal structures were displaced in transverse direction under all loading conditions. Only expansion or protraction force resulted in transverse displacement of nodes. RME produces greater transverse displacement as compared to SME. Maxgym forces produce greater transverse displacement as compared to facemask. Maxgym with RME produces greater transverse displacement as compared to Maxgym with SME, whereas facemask with RME produces greater transverse displacement as compared to facemask with SME. Maxgym forces produce greater transverse displacement as compared to facemask with or without expansion. ","215":"Maintaining oral hygiene is a challenging task for the visually impaired population.

The present case series is a follow-up of five cases of delayed replantation (more than 24 h delay) without any root surface treatment. Extraoral endodontic therapy was performed before replantation. The avulsed teeth were stabilized using an acid-etch composite resin splint for 4 weeks. The patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months interval and half-yearly thereafter, for examination of the replanted teeth clinically and radiographically. After 24-month follow-up, the replanted teeth were evaluated for gingival changes and clinical mobility. The radiographs were evaluated for external root resorption or inflammatory resorption, osseous root replacement, or replacement resorption. The case series concludes that avulsed teeth transported in dry as well as dessicated conditions and replanted after a delay of 24 h have a survival rate of more than 24 months, though there is no promising long-term prognosis. The sequelae in most of the cases are surface resorption followed by inflammatory resorption or resorption due to pulpal infection or replacement resorption.","247":"Although it was believed that attachment was due to the food provided by the parent figure, later it was proved that attachment is because the child considers parent figure as secure base. Hence, when a child feels distressed in dental operatory, the type of attachment pattern will determine the behavior of a child. This, in turn, could determine the weather parental presence is needed or not in dental operatory. Hence, attachment patterns could affect the quality of dental treatment delivered.","248":"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of chlorhexidine on the outcome of pit and fissure sealant (PFS) in permanent molars. A double-blind randomized controlled trial using split-mouth design was conducted for a period of 1 year. The clinical trial registry was done in the Indian Council of Medical Research, and the clinical trial number obtained was CTRI\/2016\/08\/007222. The age group of participants involved in the trial was 7-14 years. Maxillary or mandibular permanent molar which satisfies the criteria for application of PFS was included in the trial. Based on the eligibility criteria and considering the unknown observer\/instrumentation errors, the sample size is 33 for each group. Simple randomization of treatment allocation was carried out using computer-generated random number for treatment assignment of the right molar tooth. The left molar received the alternative treatment. The outcomes of PFS were evaluated by a lone proficient assessor by means of the mouth mirrors and probes following the US public health service criteria. A 6-month evaluation for the PFS with and without chlorhexidine showed 77.27% and 89.39% retention, respectively. PFS without chlorhexidine suffered a greater loss of surface texture and marginal discoloration in comparison to PFS with chlorhexidine at 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals, but it was statistically insignificant. The present study showed improvement in outcome of PFS when an additional step of chlorhexidine is added although the results were statistically nonsignificant. ","249":"Recent investigations have shown the possible involvement of bacteria other than mutans group and Lactobacilli in the etiology of caries. Molecular methods have been used to study the microbial diversity in caries-active (CA) and caries-free (CF) children. Among them, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is more popular and has been used in the present study. The aim of the present study was to investigate the difference in bacterial diversity in saliva and plaque samples from CF and CA children using DGGE. The study involved saliva and plaque samples from 56 children of which 28 were CF, 20 with CA, and 8 with white spot lesions (WSP). DNA was extracted and subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification with universal primers. It was then run in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with gradients of urea and formamide and stained with SYBR green. Multiple bands were produced in each sample lane and each band represents one organism. A dendrogram was generated using Phoretix software and similarity index was calculated using a specific formula. Samples in each group formed several clusters indicating a specific pattern of the bacterial profile. Similarity coefficient was calculated based on the number of bands, intensity, and location. The diversity was less in the saliva and plaque samples of CA group as compared to those of CF and WSP groups. DGGE can be used to study distinctive bacterial profiles in healthy and caries-affected sites. DGGE can be further developed as a pattern recognition tool with which to identify specific groups of bacteria. Saliva may be used to study bacterial diversity in dental caries.

Development of vocal sound into meaningful speech was one of the major discoveries which have made the human beings to reach the pinnacle of the animal kingdom. The ability to speak is determined by the flow of air into the mouth which affects pronunciation of various words and phrases. This study aimed to evaluate speech changes before and after prosthetic rehabilitation with fixed functional space maintainer in children with missing maxillary anterior teeth. The study sample comprised of 25 children in the age range of 3-6 years having at least two maxillary anterior teeth indicated for extraction or had already got extracted. Speech therapist evaluated articulation of [v], [ph], [n], [d], [dh], [th], [t], [s.],[s], and [l] speech sounds of patients preoperatively (T0), postoperatively after the appliance insertion (T1), and postoperatively after 7 days (T2) using Weiss Comprehensive Articulation Test. The data obtained were analyzed using Chi-square and Mcnemar's test. There was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) correction in [v], [ph], [d], [dh], [th], [t], [s.], and [s] speech sounds immediately after prosthetic rehabilitation (T1). While, the assessment of speech sounds after 7 days of appliance insertion (T2) showed statistically nonsignificant differences. The results suggested that treatment of a patient with missing anterior teeth should not be restricted to esthetic and functional oral rehabilitation, but also comprehend with the speech, as premature loss of the primary maxillary incisor appears to have long-term effect on the speech development.

","252":"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disability the exact cause of which is not known. Exposure to toxic elements, environmental pollutants, and various teratogens such as lead, either prenatal or postnatal, can be a risk factor for this neurologic disability. CP children have poor neuromuscular coordination, exposing them to increased risk of oral diseases such as drooling of saliva, periodontal diseases, dental caries, and malocclusion. There are less studies comparing lead concentration in CP children, as it can be one of the contributing factors to dental caries. The present study was to estimate and compare the salivary lead level in normal and neurologically disabled children and to correlate salivary lead level with dental caries in both normal and neurologically disabled children. A study on 45 children reporting to CP rehabilitation center and 41 normal children taken from the Outpatient Department of the Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry. P.M.N.M. Dental College and Hospital, Bagalkot, Karnataka. All children were between the age group of 5-12 years. In all individuals, a thorough medical history and dental examination were done. The age, state of dentition, and the level of caries in all individuals were determined by the same examiner, and salivary lead concentrations were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. All children were divided into four groups depending on the presence or absence of dental caries. Group 1 consisted of 20 normal children with dental caries, Group 2 consisted of 21 normal children without dental caries, Group 3 consisted of 25 CP children with dental caries, and Group 4 consisted of 20 CP children without dental caries. Were recorded tabulated and statistically analyzed. CP children had high decayed, missing, and filled teeth\/def scores, dental caries, and salivary lead concentration as compared to normal children. Statistically significant correlation was obtained between the dental caries and saliva lead concentration. The lead concentration was directly proportional to the carious status. CP children are more prone to dental caries and increased salivary lead concentration which could be a cause as well as the effect of CP. ","253":"Nutrition has a great impact on children's health. Of great concern are the underweight children because of the risk of illness and mortality in them. Being overweight can also have long-lasting adverse effect on development of the child. The purpose of this study was to determine body mass index (BMI) and dental development in normal and underweight children and to carry out a correlative analysis of calculated dental age, chronological age, and BMI in normal and underweight children of age group of 6-13 years of Navi Mumbai, India. The sample for the study consisted of 301 participants, that is, 171 boys and 130 girls who were divided into two groups, namely, normal and underweight. When BMI was less than normal, calculated dental age was less and thus the dental development was retarded and vice versa.

However, they suffer from technique sensitivity, limited ability to crimp and associated higher costs. The present study was planned to clinically evaluate and compare the success of preformed SSCs in which esthetic modification was done using three different techniques of composite veneering. A total of 60 primary molars selected from patients between the age group of 4-9 years were randomly divided into three groups having 20 samples each: Group A (composite veneering done using the open face technique), Group B (composite veneering done after sand-blasting SSCs), and Group C (composite veneering done after preparing retentive grooves on SSCs). The patients were evaluated at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months as per evaluation criteria. Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA were used to compare means among three groups at different time intervals. All 60 SSCs were retained at the end of the study, thereby demonstrating 100% success of SSCs. Open window technique of veneering significantly showed maximum retention of composite veneers; therefore, highest level of parental satisfaction. Overall, the most common fracture was of adhesive type seen at the metal composite interface. All the three techniques used provide a chairside and easy method for esthetic modification of the SSCs. The open window is the most successful of the three methods of veneering and may be clinically useful technique for dental practitioners and pediatric dentists.

Many dentists have reportedly and controversially used parental separation anxiety as a tool to control behavior of an uncooperative child and also to deliver quality dental treatment in young children. But is the parental separation beneficial for dentist to gain child cooperation? The objective is to evaluate the influence of parental presence or absence in the operating room on child's behavior during dental procedure on children of 4 years and above. The study was carried out on 30 children of 4-7 years of age group, 16 (4-6 years) preschoolers, and 14 (6-7 years) early schoolers. Two consecutive restorative procedures were carried out. On a first visit, parents were present and on a second visit, separation of parents was done. Behavior rating was done by commonly used Frankel's Behavior Rating Scale. Chi-square test was performed for the statistical analysis. There was no significant difference found in the child's behavior by the presence or absence of parents in the perception of dental treatment in the dental operatory. In contrast to that there was a significant increase in cooperative behavior of some children due to other factors influencing the behavior of the child with a Chi-square value = 35.296, P &lt; 0.001.

","327":"Dental caries is one of the most common preventable childhood infections. a number of measures are available to prevent occlusal caries; pit and fissure sealants are one of the various methods currently available to cost effectively reduce dental caries. To evaluate the retention of pit and fissure sealant bonded using sixth (Adper promt), seventh (Optibond) and eighth (Futurabond Dual Cure) generations of adhesives. A total of 37 healthy children who fulfilled the inclusion were randomly selected. A total of 148 teeth (4 in each subject) were used as samples for the study. The teeth to be sealed were then isolated using rubber dam. The placement of adhesives was done using split mouth design. The first permanent molars were randomly divided into four groups on the basis of sealant placed without and with using 6th, 7th and 8th generation bonding agents as follows: GROUP A (N=37):- Pit and fissure sealant placed without bonding agent. GROUP B (N=37):- Pit and fissure sealant placed following sixth generation bonding agent (ADPER PROMT). GROUP C (N=37):- Pit and fissure sealant placed following seventh generation bonding agent. (OPTIBOND). GROUP D (N=37):- Pit and fissure sealant placed following eighth generation bonding agent. (FUTURA BOND DUAL CURE). The integrity of the sealant placed was assessed immediately after completion of the procedure, 3 months and 6 months after placement. The post-operative evaluation for retention was done using Simonsen criteria. A score of 0 was given for complete retention, 1 for partial retention and 2 for no retention. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software version 21. It was found that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups after 3 and 6 months as the value obtained (0.133) was much greater than the p-value (0.05). This study concluded that the use of bonding agent prior to application of pit and fissure sealant does not necessarily aid in retention of sealant as compared to pit and fissure sealant placed without bonding agent, Sealants effectiveness is directly related to its retention and it dependent on application procedures. The failure of retention of pit and fissure sealants can attribute to moisture contamination, improper curing methods, inadequate adhesion, improper application procedure or early age placement.

This paper throws light on the communication skills we need to imbibe to be a successful pediatric dentist. A new terminology \"Pediatric Dentistese\" has been coined similar to motherese, parentese, or baby talk. Since baby talk cannot be applied to all age groups of children, pediatric dentistese has been defined as \"the proactive development-based individualized communication between the pediatric dentist and the child which helps to build trust, allay fear, and treat the child effectively and efficiently.\"","394":"","395":"Knowledge of the different anatomical variations in root canal system of dedicious dentition will improve the practice of the pediatric dentists. The teeth with C-shaped root canal configurations are definitely a problem in endodontic treatment. Dentists who are specialists of endodontics must have adequate knowledge about various root canal morphologies of primary tooth that have a tendency for rapid progression of dental caries to achieve a technically satisfactory outcome. This report presents an extraordinary case of unusual tooth morphology involving the mandibular first primary molar with a C-shaped configuration which has not yet been reported. ","396":"The study aims to evaluate the effect of the application of two antioxidants on the bond strength of composite resin to bleached enamel. Eighty enamel surfaces were obtained from forty human extracted premolars. Specimens were randomly divided into four groups (n = 20). Group 1: No bleaching (control); Group 2a: Bleaching with 15% carbamide peroxide gel; Group 2b: Bleaching, followed by application of 10% sodium ascorbate gel; Group 2c: Bleaching, followed by application of 5% proanthocyanidin agent. Surfaces were etched followed by application of total etch bonding system, and composite resin cylinders were bonded. Specimens were tested for shear bond strength. One-way analysis of variance was used for multiple group comparison and post hoc Tukey's test for individual group-wise comparison. Significantly higher shear bond strength values were observed in Group 2c and 2b as compared with Group 1 and 2a (P &lt; 0.05). Among the antioxidants, Group 2c showed significantly higher shear bond strength values than Group 2b (P &lt; 0.05). It can be concluded that the use of antioxidant before bonding procedures on bleached enamel completely neutralizes the deleterious effects of bleaching and increases the bond strength significantly. ","397":"Reduction of the bacterial populations to levels compatible with periradicular tissue healing is the primary microbiological goal of the endodontic treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. The number of visits required to treat teeth with apical periodontitis represents one of the most debatable issues in endodontics. The objective of this study was to compare and evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcome of single- versus two-visit pulpectomy treatment in primary teeth with apical periodontitis at the end of 6-month healing period. A parallel group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was carried out in 64 children aged 4-8 years. Nonvital primary teeth with apical periodontitis with enough coronal structure were selected. Sixty-four children were assigned randomly into two groups (32 children each) by block randomization, and allocation concealment was done with closed envelop method. Group I underwent single-visit pulpectomy followed by obturation with zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE). Group II underwent conventional two-visit pulpectomy with intracanal calcium hydroxide, followed by obturation with ZOE. Postoperative clinical and radiographic evaluation was carried out at 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of the treatment. The data were analyzed by Wilcoxon's signed rank test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Friedman test. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical and radiographic outcomes in both the groups at the end of 6-month healing period. Single-visit pulpectomy can be considered as a viable option for the treatment of primary teeth with apical periodontitis. ","398":"To evaluate the fracture resistance in simulated immature teeth that had been backfilled using composite resin and Biodentine after using Biodentine as an apical plug material immediately and after 3 months of aging. Sixty extracted human maxillary central incisors were simulated in an immature open apex. The roots of all the specimens were then standardized to a length of 10 mm and canals were instrumented to obtain the radicular dentin thickness around 1.5 mm. All the specimens were then randomly divided into three groups of twenty teeth each. Group I (control) - 4 mm apical plug of Biodentine backfilled with thermoplasticized gutta-percha. Group II - 4 mm apical plug of Biodentine and then backfilled with ParaCore. Group III - completely filled with Biodentine. Ten samples from each group were randomly divided into two subgroups. In subgroup A: Specimens were stored for 1 week. In subgroup B: Specimens were stored in phosphate-buffered saline solution for 3 months and were subjected to universal testing machine. Statistical analysis was done using one-way analysis. No significant difference in fracture resistance between the groups was observed when tested immediately. After 3 months of aging, only Biodentine group showed a significant reduction in fracture resistance without significant reduction with other two groups. Biodentine group has shown a drastic reduction in fracture resistance after 3 months of aging, and hence cannot be recommended as a reinforcement material in immature teeth with thin dentin walls.

Use of teeth to represent a physical profile is valuable for identification of an individual. The present study aims to assess the clinical crown length (CL) of erupted deciduous teeth and height of the child. A correlation of these parameters was attempted to arrive at a mathematical equation which would formulate a ratio of tooth CL to individual height that would support in estimating the probable height of the child. About 60 children (30 males and 30 females) of age ranged from 3-6 years were included in this study. Clinical vertical CLs of the deciduous dentition (tooth numbers 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55) were calculated using digital Vernier calipers (Aerospace Ltd., Bengaluru, Karnataka, India) on the cast models. Child height was measured using a standard measuring tape. Ratios of deciduous CL to height of the child were recorded. Linear stepwise forward regression analysis was applied to predict the probability of CL of a tooth most likely to support in prediction of physical height of the child. Tabulated results showed a probable correlation between tooth CL and height of the child. Tooth CLs of deciduous upper right second molar (55) among the males, lateral incisor (52) among females, and canine (53) using the combined male and female data were statistically significant, and they approximately predicted the child height with minimal variations. Mathematically derived equations based on linear stepwise forward regression analysis using sixty children data are height prediction (derived from combined data of male and female children) = 400.558 + 90.264 (53 CL), male child height prediction (derived from data of male children) = 660.290 + 72.970 (55 CL), and female child height prediction (derived from data of female children) = -187.942 + 194.818 (52 CL). In conclusion, clinical vertical CL is an important parameter in prediction of individual height and possible identification of the individual. An extension of the similar technique to all the deciduous dentition using a larger group of children would probably give us the best options available among vertical CLs for prediction of the child height.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the biocompatibility of PC as a pulpotomy medicament. Thirty premolars that scheduled for extraction for therapeutic reasons were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: ProRoot MTA (PMTA) and PC. After isolation and pulp exposure, pulpotomy was carried out and pulps were dressed with PMTA and PC. After 6 months, the teeth were extracted and prepared for histological analysis based on Cox et al. criteria. The data were analyzed by Z-test of proportion with 1% of allowed error. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to inflammatory response, soft tissue organization, and dentine bridge formation (P &gt; 0.05). PC was associated with similar favorable biological response to pulpotomy treatment as PMTA. The findings of this study support the idea that PC can be considered a cheaper substitute to MTA.

The literature to testify the efficacy of natural alternatives in primary teeth is meagre and its effects as irrigating solutions need to be evaluated. To evaluate the antibacterial effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite, ethanolic extracts of Curcuma longa (turmeric) and Camellia sinensis (green tea) as irrigating solutions against the anaerobic bacteria isolated from the root canals of infected primary teeth. Thirty patients were selected based on the selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. Preoperative radiographs were taken. Rubber dam isolation and working length estimation were done, following which thirty samples were taken from the root canals of infected primary teeth using sterile absorbent paper points and transferred to tubes containing thioglycolate transport medium. The bacteria were then isolated using standard microbiological protocols and were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity testing using the three test irrigants. SPSS 18 software using Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. The most commonly isolated bacteria included Porphyromonas sp., Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Sodium hypochlorite and C. longa (turmeric) showed good antibacterial effect and were effective against most of the isolated bacteria. There was statistically significant difference in the antibacterial effect among the three tested groups (P &lt; 0.001). The least effective was C. sinensis (green tea). The infected primary teeth almost always present with a polymicrobial structure with a wide variety of anaerobic bacteria. The chemo-mechanical preparation plays an important role in eradicating the population of predominant micro-organisms in treating these teeth with promising effects with the use of newer test irrigants while avoiding the side effects of sodium hypochlorite.

Many factors contribute to the dental behavior of the child. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sociodemographic factors, general anxiety, body mass index (BMI), and role of multimedia on the child behavior (CB) in the dental operatory. Three hundred and one children aged 3-14 years and their parents participated in the study. In the first visit, the questionnaire was filled by the parent and general examination was done. During the second visit, the required dental procedure was rendered, and the behavior was recorded by a single examiner. Among sociodemographic factors, increasing age is directly related to child's positive behavior, whereas other factors such as gender and socioeconomic status (SES) are not significantly related. General anxiety significantly affects the child's behavior. BMI of the child is not related to child's behavior in dental operatory. Multimedia was not found to be significantly affecting the behavior of the child in dental operatory.

Twenty-five molars were assessed using all three systems under standardized in vivo conditions. They were then extracted and also assessed by examiners in vitro. Downer's histological scoring criterion was the validation gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and area under the receiver-operator curves were calculated for enamel caries and dentine caries. Repeatability was analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The performances of the systems between in vivo and in vitro settings by the same examiner were also compared. SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the data. Comparison of the performance of all three systems for all caries and dentine caries using receiver operating characteristic curves was calculated using a range of cutoffs. Reliability was assessed using ICC method. ICDAS II system showed the highest validity and repeatability for assessing occlusal caries in the primary molars. RVG was less accurate than the ICDAS II for detecting caries lesions confined to enamel. However, when dentine was involved, RVG was found to be as effective as ICDAS II. Within the limitations of the study, the in vivo results of ICDAS II and RVG were satisfactory and comparable to those obtained in vitro, with ICDAS II performing better. The ACIS device was least accurate among the three systems for caries assessment.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized the inappropriate, indiscriminate, and irrational use of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance as a global problem. The objective of this survey is to compare the antibiotic prescription pattern and the awareness of antibiotic resistance among Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) practitioners and pediatric dentists. A hundred BDS practitioners and 100 pediatric dentists included in the study were given a questionnaire containing both open-ended and closed-ended questions. The questionnaire comprised information pertaining to antibiotic prescription for most common oral conditions, commonly prescribed antibiotics, their dosage, etc. The majority of the practitioners prescribed antibiotics for managing oral diseases. On comparing the prescription patterns between the BDS practitioners and pediatric dentists, there was an overprescription in the BDS group for many conditions, which was statistically significant. Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed drug in both the groups. In the presence of an anaerobic infection, the most preferred drug was a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid with metronidazole. With regard to the duration of antibiotic prescription, 74% BDS practitioners prescribed antibiotics as a 3-day course and 60% pediatric dentists resorted to a 5-day course, which was statistically significant. The awareness regarding antibiotic prophylaxis and antibiotic resistance was found to be adequate in both the groups. However, there was a general lack of awareness with regard to the guidelines for antibiotic prescribing in both the groups.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of NovaMin to remineralize an experimentally induced demineralized lesion. The evaluation was done based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of enamel over the period of 15 and 30 days. A sample of 120 noncarious premolar teeth extracted for orthodontic reasons were used for the study. Baseline data for hardness, Ca\/PO 4 , and surface characteristics before and after demineralization process was obtained. All the teeth were brushed twice daily at 12 h interval with the test agents using a powered toothbrush for 2 min. The samples were tested on the 15 th and 30 th day. Calcium phosphate ratio and hardness in both the groups improved during the study period. Fluoride group showed higher values for Ca\/PO 4 and hardness but was not statistically significant with the P &gt; 0.05. Scanning electron microscope pictures showed that the deposition of the material over the decalcified enamel is more smoother and uniform with NovaMin and more irregular with fluoride.

Cephalograms of 120 subjects with 6-17 years were taken and various linear and angular measurements were measured and data was analyzed using the unpaired t test. Adenoids were significantly larger and the upper airway smaller in the juvenile and adolescent cleft group than in the non-cleft group. In the adolescent cleft group, airway was larger than that in the adolescent non-cleft group. The maxilla was small and retropositioned in juvenile and adolescent subjects as compared to non cleft cases. Length of velum was smaller and need ratio was larger in both juvenile and adolescent groups as compared to the non-cleft group, suggestive of velopharyngeal incompetence. Decreased Adenoids, restricted airway, small, retruded maxilla, smaller velum length and larger need ratio larger were seen in the cleft group as compared to the non-cleft group, which was suggestive of VPI.

These characteristic cognitive principles have not been assessed in a dental setting. Research on the cognitive development of the child and its application to dental health care can enable pediatric dentists to better understand, approach and deliver improved quality of care to children. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of Piaget's cognitive principles among preoperational children. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 children, aged 4-7 years. Various characteristics, specific for this age group, such as egocentrism, concept of cardinal numbers based on centration, lack of conservation, and reversibility were assessed, using three tangible experiments and two interview questions. A comparison of the prevalence of each character was carried out among the children based on their age. The prevalence of egocentrism based on the three mountain experiment was 65% and the personal interview showed a prevalence of 58%. Centration was appreciated in 83% of the study sample. The beaker experiment and the interview question revealed a lack of conservation in 89% and 59% of the children, respectively. There was a gradual and uniform reduction in the prevalence of the characters with an increase in age. All the three features assessed were observed in most of the children between 4 and 7 years of age as described by Piaget and most of his principles still appear valid today.

The maxillary incisors underwent injuries more commonly than the mandibular incisors. Padding of the teeth was the most common precaution taken to prevent injuries to the teeth which, however, is not adequate. The management for such injuries was inadequate and in many cases, the patients' referral to a dentist was not considered post-operatively. Pediatric dentists can play a major role in creating the awareness among the anesthesia providers regarding prevention of oro-dental injuries during anesthesia.

Various caries management protocols have been tried to make the dental visit more compatible to the child patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the behavioral and physiological responses to chemo-mechanical caries removal (CMCR) and conventional drilling method (CDM). A total of 20 children with an age range of 7 to 11 years with bilateral frank carious lesions were included in this study. They were randomized into two groups: Group A--treated with CDM first followed by CMCR and Group B--treated with CMCR first followed by CDM. The physiological signs (pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation) were noted prior to treatment, during treatment, post treatment and 5 min after treatment. The behavioral responses were assessed by face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability scale and facial image scale. The participants were interviewed about pain, discomfort, taste, smell, preference and overall experience after every procedure. The pediatric dentist filled in details about patient behavior, time utilized and need for local anesthesia. The results were statistically analyzed using t-test and Chi-square test appropriately (SPSS version 11). There was no significant difference in any of the physiological parameters assessed between the two groups. Discomfort was significantly more (P &lt; 0.025) in the CDM group than CMCR group. The time taken by the dentist was significantly lesser (P &lt; 0.01) in the CDM group.

Seventy-two specimens (36 of each material) were prepared and by placing the restorative materials into Teflon mold. Each specimen was subjected to one of three daily treatments (n = 12): (1) No fluoride treatment (control); (2) application of a fluoride dentifrice (1,000 ppm) once daily; and (3) the same regimen as (2), plus immersion in a 0.05% sodium fluoride (NaF) mouth rinse (225 ppm) immediately following the dentifrice application. Specimens were suspended in a storage vial containing 10 ml demineralizing solution for 6 h and transferred to a new test tube containing 10 ml remineralizing solution for 18 h. Fluoride treatments of the specimens were completed every day prior to their immersion in the demineralizing solution. Media solutions were buffered with equal volumes of total ionic strength adjustment buffer (TISAB) II; fluoride levels were measured using a digital ion analyzer and fluoride electrode throughout the 21 day duration of the experiment. Nano-ionomeric glass ionomer showed a better amount of fluoride release than PRG composite irrespective of the fluoride treatment supplementation (P &lt; 0.01). Additional fluoride supplementation improved fluoride release and recharge ability for both the materials when compared to their respective control groups. The fluoride recharge for both materials did not show any sustained pattern of release. Nano-ionomeric glass ionomer demonstrated a greater ability to release and recharge compared with that of PRG composite. ","625":"To know the effect of surface protective agents used in day-to-day practice on the fluoride release property of conventional glass ionomer cements (GIC) and discuss its pros and cons. Thirty disc-shaped specimens were fabricated from conventional GIC and block randomized into three groups (Group I, II, and III) of 10 each. Group I specimens were unprotected, group II coated with cavity varnish (Namuvar, Ratnagiri, India) and group III with petroleum jelly (Vaseline, Hindustan lever ltd). After polymerization, the disks were immersed in three individual sealable plastic bottles containing deionized distilled water which was changed every 24 hours for 15 days to measure the fluoride release. STATISTICS AND RESULTS: Statistical analysis was carried using software version Systat 10.0, and the data was subjected to one way ANOVA, using Duncan Multiple Range test (Variable LSD) with the level of significance set at 0.05 (P &lt; 0.05). The greatest amount of fluoride was released from the uncoated group, followed in ranking by petroleum jelly and varnish coated and the difference among them was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). Application of varnish over GIC can severely impede its fluoride release property. Similarly petroleum jelly also impedes the fluoride release, but to a very less extent. We suggest that in situations where the fluoride release property is more important than other properties it is better to coat the GIC with petroleum jelly or leave the restoration without any coating.

Eighty children were evaluated for physio-chemical properties of saliva, out which 40 were caries-active (group 1) and 40 caries-free (control group). Caries status of each child was scored by using DMFS and dfs indices to get a combined DMFS and dfs score. The physio-chemical properties were evaluated using Saliva Check (GC Asia Dental Pte Ltd- India) and streptococcus mutans using Dentocult SM Strip Mutans. Flow rate, pH, and buffering capacity of saliva in caries-active children were decreased but not statistically significant. The Streptococcus mutant count of saliva was increased significantly in caries-active children. The physio-chemical properties of saliva like pH, buffering capacity, salivary flow rate, concentration of various components like proteins, calcium and antioxidant defense system play a major role in the development of caries.

The related literature is also being reviewed in this article.","693":"Impaction of primary anterior teeth is very rare. A tooth that fails to erupt into normal functional position by the time it normally should is considered impacted. A rare case of impacted dilacerated maxillary primary incisors in a 3-year-old child is presented. The diagnostic position of impacted primary incisors was determined using conical beam computed tomography (CBCT) to assist in surgical intervention with least surgical trauma to the tissues.","694":"The case presented here is of a 15-year-old girl in whom nearly all the teeth except for lower first molars and lower central incisors showed short roots as observed through panoramic radiograph. At the same time there was difference in the length of roots of various teeth. The patient suffered an acute attack of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) at the age of 8 years and since no other possible explanation for the short roots anomaly could be found, it could be concluded that the cessation in root development may have been caused by the destruction or damage of the epithelial root sheath during the SJS disease.","695":"Orofacial granulomatosis comprises a group of diseases characterized by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation affecting the soft tissues of the oral and maxillofacial region. The most common clinical presentation is persistent swelling of one or both lips. It is important to establish the diagnosis accurately because this condition is sometimes a manifestation of Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis. This article describes a case of orofacial granulomatosis.","696":"Seckel syndrome, first defined by Seckel in 1960, is a rare (incidence 1:10,000), genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder presenting at birth. This syndrome is characterized by a proportionate dwarfism of prenatal onset, a severe microcephaly with a \"bird-headed\" like appearance (beaked nose, receding forehead, prominent eyes, and micrognathia), and mental retardation. The significance of dental alterations in this syndrome resides in the defect, hypoplastic enamel, being limited to the primary dentition; in most instances the second primary molar tooth is not affected. A case of the Seckel syndrome is presented.","697":"Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of craniofacial development characterized by variable involvement of the craniofacial structures derived from the first and second branchial arches. Occurrence of this syndrome is relatively rare with wide variations in the clinical expression. Aspects of speech, appearance, and social well-being along with psychological issues are hampered in these patients. Treating such disabled children poses a great challenge not only in the medical field but also in the dental meadow. We report a case of a 5-year-old boy who presented with this syndrome and the dental treatment was carried out with a noteworthy outcome for a period of 8 years. A brief review of etiology, dental anomalies along with prognosis is documented.","698":"Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with early-onset diabetes mellitus (also known as Wolcott-Rallison syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that manifests itself in early infancy with symptoms of diabetes mellitus. Short stature and walking difficulties become evident in the 2 nd year of life when the child starts to walk. These skeletal changes are progressive with age. There is usually a short trunk, excessive lordosis, a short and broad chest, and genu valgum. This report presents a case of Wolcott-Rallison syndrome in a 10 year old child.","699":"Hereditary, environmental and developmental factors play an important role in dentofacial development, as well as the initiation of malocclusion disorder. Allergic phenomenon such as asthma that induces an alternative mode of breathing in patients is a contributing factor in development of the dental arch. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the dentoalveolar morphology in asthmatic children and to analyze the effects of asthmatic medications on the dental arch. This study is centered on 44 asthmatic children aged between 6-12 years from J.S.S Hospital, Mysore. Selected variables from model analysis of the casts of the asthmatic group were subjected to comparison with those of the non-asthmatic group, which comprised of 44 non-asthmatic children. Selected parameters were arch width, arch length and palatal depth. Impressions of upper and lower arches were made with rubber based impression material. A sliding digital caliper was used to measure the casts for arch width and arch length. A palatal depth gauge was used to measure the palatal depth. Differences in arch widths, arch lengths and palatal depths between asthmatics and non-asthmatics groups were evaluated by independent sample t-tests. Chi-square test was applied to assess the frequency of occurrence of malocclusion in the asthmatic children. The results obtained revealed that the arch length and palatal depth of asthmatic group had higher values compared to that of non-asthmatic groups for both age groups (6 to 8-year-old males and females, 10 to 12-year-old males and females). Inter molar width showed a significant lower value in asthmatics in the maxillary arches of 10 to 12-year-old females. Fifty percent of the asthmatic children aged 10 to 12-years had open-bite. Children under regular medication showed significant deviation in the dentoalveolar morphology as compared to those under irregular medication. The present study proves a strong relation between asthma and dentoalveolar morphology. ","700":null,"701":"Dental caries is the most prevalent oral disease. Streptococcus mutans plays a major role in the occurrence of dental caries. Many antibacterial agents have been developed against dental caries. However, they lack the qualities of an ideal agent. Thus presently, antibacterial activity of herbal agents is being extensively studied. In the present study, ethanol extract of Terminalia chebula was prepared and mouthrinse was formulated. A total of 60 children meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into study and control group and respective mouthrinses were administered. Salivary Streptococcus mutans count was assessed at 5 and 60 minutes after rinsing and compared with baseline values. Substantivity of the rinse was assessed among 10 children. Mouthrinse was given to the children and salivary Streptococcus mutans counts were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 hours postrinsing. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the variance of factors like Decayed Missed Filled Teeth, plaque scores, and gingival scores. ANCOVA (Analysis of covariance) was used to determine the change in salivary Streptococcus mutans colony forming units taking baseline values as covariates. It was observed that there was 44.42% reduction in salivary Streptococcus mutans colony forming units 5 minutes after rinsing as compared with baseline values and 64.14% reduction in Streptococcus mutans colony forming units at 60 minutes after rinsing as compared with baseline values. There was a reduction of 35.48% in salivary Streptococcus mutans colony forming units at 60 minutes after rinsing as compared with 5 minutes sample. Streptococcus mutans counts were low up to 6 hours postrinsing among 80% of the children. ","702":"To evaluate retention of two resin based fissure sealants (Embrace and Delton FS+) for a period of twelve months. Sixty eight first permanent molars were sealed for seventeen healthy children in the age group of six-eight years. According to random selection, the first permanent molars on the right side of both arches were sealed with Embrace (Group A) and on the left side of both arches were sealed with Delton FS+ (Group B). The total retention of Embrace was 23.50% and for Delton FS+ was 17.60% at one year. At one year the total retention of Embrace was 23.50% and for Delton FS+ was 17.60%, however the results were statistically insignificant. ","703":null,"704":"The aim of the present study was the evaluation of non-microbial salivary caries activity parameters and salivary biochemical indicators in predicting dental caries. The present study was carried out on 60 children, aged 4-6 years, selected from the schools of Panchkula district, Haryana, on the basis of their caries status. Level of hydration, flow rate, pH, buffering capacity, relative viscosity, calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels in caries-free and caries-active children were evaluated. Results showed that 90% of subjects in the caries-free group and 30% of subjects in the caries-active group had normal level of hydration value of less than 60 s and the difference was found to be statistically very highly significant. Normal flow rate of stimulated saliva was found in 90% of the subjects in caries-free group and 33.3% subjects in the caries active group and difference was found to be statistically very highly significant. Adequate salivary pH was found in 100% subjects in caries-free group and 30% in caries-active group and the difference was statistically very highly significant. To conclude, within limitations of this study, it became clear that normal level of hydration and higher values for flow rate, pH, buffering capacity of saliva lead to good oral health and a reduced caries occurrence. Increased salivary viscosity plays a role in increasing caries incidence. Salivary biochemical indicators like calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase also play their respective role in determining caries susceptibility of an individual. These salivary parameters can be used as diagnostic tool for caries risk assessment.

The study sample comprised of 4 stainless steel plates with a thickness of 2 mm. For these stainless steel plates, holes were made to a diameter of 3 mm. The samples were divided into 4 groups of 8 each and labeled as group I, group II, group III, group IV, thus making provision for the two different modes of light exposure. In each group, the hole was restored with its respective restorative material and cured with light-curing unit according to manufacturer instructions. The results were statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney test. It was concluded that the curing efficacy of the LED lamp was comparable to that of conventional halogen lamp, even with a 50% reduction in cure time, and resin composite (Filtek Z-250) presented the highest hardness values, whereas complete hardening of resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) (Vitremer) was observed because of its self-curing system even after the removal of light source.

Parents of healthy (Group A) and special children (Group B) watched videotape vignette of 10 behavior management techniques (BMTs) in groups and rated them using Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Group B parents were subgrouped as: Group B 1 (34 parents of medically compromised children), Group B 2 (34 parents of physically compromised children), and Group B 3 (34 parents of children with neuropathological disorders). Both Group A and Group B subjects judged all techniques as \"acceptable.\" Group B parents were less accepting to techniques than Group A parents, except live modeling. Contingent escape and live modeling were the first ranked techniques in Group A and Group B parents, respectively. Voice control (VC) and hand-over-mouth exercise (HOM) were the least accepted techniques in both groups. Parents with low income and less education were more receptive to the techniques studied. A total of 25.49% of parents in each group did not consent to the use of HOM. Factors such as having a disabled child, low income, and less education influenced parental acceptability. HOM should be used with great caution and clinicians should approach the issue of informed consent on an individual basis. ","708":"The buccal bulge of the deciduous first molars has always been a restorative challenge to the pediatric dentist. Morphologically it may vary from a slight prominence to a well-developed cusp-like structure. This study was conducted to determine the variable buccal surface morphology of deciduous first molar and its clinical relevance. A prospective study was conducted whereby 2016 patients visiting the outpatient clinic of dental hospital over 1 year were evaluated. Any variation in buccal surface morphology of the deciduous first molars was recorded photographically or by replicating in dental stone. Varied morphological patterns on buccal surface were observed for which a new classification scheme has been proposed. The surface morphology of deciduous teeth crowns must be studied carefully as it may be indicative of pulpal extensions and accessory roots, requiring consideration during restorative treatment planning. ","709":"Most common lesions seen in children are mucoceles. Different techniques have been described for their treatment; however, most of them are invasive. Aim of the study was to compare the practicability of micro-marsupialization with surgical excision in treatment of mucoceles. A pilot study was done on 15 patients to evaluate and compare variables like lesion evolution, surgical time period, healing, complications etc. when lesions were treated with micro-marsupialization and surgical excision. Most of the mucoceles diagnosed in this pilot study were found in lower lip. Amongst cases that were treated with micro-marsupialization, recurrence was seen only in one case, whereas there were 3 cases of recurrence seen in surgical excision group. No statistically significant difference was found between the treatment methods used. Micro-marsupialization can be a non-invasive option to treat mucoceles in pediatric dentistry owing to its simplicity, fewer complications involved and as well that it's well-tolerated by patients.

Rehabilitation of such children is a challenge and requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach not only to correct the defect, but also to ensure normal development with minimal handicap. Here is a case report of a 10-year-old child with missing lower lip due to childhood infection and its presurgical management using a new design of fixed lower tongue crib used to limit tongue pressure, improve tongue position, and facilitate lower incisor retraction. A new clinical experience for lower lip missing cases in children are added, as these cases are rare.","711":"A case of aggressive juvenile ossifying fibroma in a child has been discussed. The unique appearance of this particular lesion demonstrates a close relationship between aggressive ossifying fibroma and well-differentiated osteogenic sarcoma. The age of the patient and the location of the tumor in the case presented made it mandatory to utilize multiple diagnostic parameters and adjunctive diagnostic help to resolve the dilemma posed by this tumor. Differentiation of ossifying fibroma from other benign and malignant neoplasms as well as fibrous dysplasia is important in correct management of the lesion.","712":"Regional odontodysplasia (RO) is considered a relatively rare dental anomaly despite increasing numbers of case reports in recent years. It usually presents as a localized anomaly in tooth development affecting a few adjacent teeth in a single maxillary or mandibular quadrant. The purpose of this paper is to describe an uncommon case of regional odotodysplasia involving noncontiguous mandibular teeth, crossing the midline in a male patient, and showing progressive normalization of tooth anatomy over a period of 6 years. Typically, teeth affected with RO become pulpally involved early on and are either extracted or endodontically treated. Such reports of automatic normalization over time in RO is supportive of a more conservative treatment approach.","713":"Symptomatic benign migratory glossitis (BMG) or \"geographic tongue\" is a rare occurrence in pediatric dentistry though asymptomatic BMG is comparatively common. BMG presents itself as an ulcer-like region on the dorsum of the tongue, which may recur at different sites on the tongue, creating a migratory appearance. Asymptomatic cases usually resolve on their own but symptomatic cases need treatment. Fissured tongue is a benign condition characterized by deep grooves on the dorsum of the tongue and, in many cases, is associated with geographic tongue.

The objectives of this study were to measure the prevalence of anterior teeth fracture and their association with predisposing factors such as lip coverage, molar relationship, overjet, and variables such as age, sex, cause, and place of trauma. an epidemiological cross-sectional study was carried out among 3708 school children aged 8-13 years in the Vadodara city. All children completed a questionnaire related to history of trauma to their anterior teeth after which they were examined for lip competence, Angle's molar relationship amount of overjet and nature of trauma sustained. The results were statistically analyzed using the prevalence test, Chi-square test, and Mantel-Haenszel Common Odds Ratio. the prevalence of traumatic injuries was 8.79% and the ratio of boys: girl's was 1.28:1. Inadequate lip coverage group sustained about five times more injuries than the adequate lip coverage group (P = 0.000, OR= 5.407). The maximum traumatic injuries were seen in children having Angle Class II Div 1 molar relationship and\/or overjet greater than 5.5 mm and was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). Maximum number of injuries occurred at 9 years of age. The most predominant injuries were enamel fractures, the most common place for occurrence was home and fall against object, the most frequent cause. the prevalence of dental injuries in the Vadodara city is high and it has a great potential to be considered as an emerging public health problem. ","719":"Caries clinical trials of sugar-free chewing gum have shown that the gum is noncariogenic and in fact has anticariogenic effect through the stimulation of saliva. Sugar-free gums, therefore, may be an excellent delivery vehicle for safe and effective additive, capable of promoting enamel remineralization. Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) nanocomplexes incorporated into sugar-free chewing gum have shown to remineralize enamel subsurface lesions in situ. So this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of CPP-ACP containing sugar-free chewing gum on salivary concentration of calcium and phosphorous. Unstimulated saliva from each 24 selected subjects was collected. Then each subject was given two pellets of chewing gum containing CPP-ACP and asked to chew for a period of 20 min, after which saliva samples were collected from each individual. Once all the samples were collected they were assessed for calcium and phosphorous concentration using affiliated reagent kits and photometer. Data obtained were analyzed using student's paired t test. Significant difference was found in the calcium and phosphorus concentration of saliva before and after chewing CPP-ACP containing chewing gum. Chewing of CPP-ACP containing chewing gum showed a significant increase in the salivary concentration of calcium for a prolonged period of time hence it may help in the remineralization of tooth surfaces. ","720":"the purpose of this study was to clinically evaluate and compare the efficacy of \"Brush Buddies\" musical tooth brush and Colgate Smile tooth brush in the reduction of established plaque and gingivitis. for this study, 120 healthy kids (73 boys and 47 Girls) were selected. The subjects were randomly assigned into two groups by a second examiner; one group used Colgate Smile brush and the other group used \"Brush Buddies\" musical tooth brush. Plaque index (Quigley and Hein), Modified Gingival Index (Lobene and Associates) and Gingival Bleeding Index (Ainamo and Bay) were assessed at baseline, 30th day, 60th day, and 90th day. all the baseline indices appeared to be well balanced. At the end of the study, reduction in plaque index, modified gingival index and gingival bleeding index were statistically highly significant during each interval for both the toothbrushes. For \"Brush Buddies\" musical tooth brush, the reduction in all clinical parameters were statistically significant for 30 days and 60 days interval, while nonsignificant at 90 days interval. both the tooth brushes used in this study were clinically effective in removing plaque, improving gingival health. Musical tooth brush is more effective initially but as the time period increases both tooth brushes give almost similar results. ","721":"to analyze the poor performance of self-etch adhesives on intact enamel. labial surfaces of 20 caries free permanent upper central and lateral incisors were cleaned, sectioned of their roots. All specimens were mounted on acrylic block and divided randomly into two groups.

Then the resin tags were analyzed using the scanning electron microscope. showed that when phosphoric acid was used, there was significant increase in the depth of penetration of resin tags. the results indicate that out of both treatment groups, pre-etching the intact enamel with 37% phosphoric acid resulted in the formation of longer resin tags and higher depth of penetration of resin tags of the Clearfil SE bond, which might have resulted in attaining higher bond strength of the Clearfil SE bond to intact enamel. ","722":"India has been the focus of many health surveys among normal, physically, and mentally handicapped children. However, the data, concerning oral health conditions of socially handicapped children living in orphanages, are scanty. To study the effect of parental inadequacy, environmental deprivation, and emotional disturbances on dental caries through intelligence quotient (IQ) and self-concept in orphan children and also to co-relate dental caries with different levels of IQ and self-concept. The study was carried out amongst socially handicapped children living in orphanages. 100 children in the age group of 10-14 years from orphanages were selected. Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC) was used to assess the intelligence quotient; self-concept questionnaire to assess self-concept of the child and recording of dental caries status of children was done as per WHO Index (1997). To assess the relationship of dental caries with IQ, student's unpaired t-test was used and; to find the relationship between self-concept and dental caries, Karl-Pearson's coefficient of co-relation was applied. the children in orphanages had a lower IQ and high caries experience but had an above average self-concept. There was also no co-relation between dental caries and self-concept. Orphan children, being socially handicapped, are at an increased risk for dental caries due to a lower IQ level, parental deprivation, and institutionalization. Moreover, lack of co-relation between dental caries and self-concept could be explained by the fact that dental caries is a lifelong process whereas different dimensions of self-concept are in a state of constant flux. ","723":"In the mid of 1980s, the cariostatic effect of fluoride ions on enamel caries had been demonstrated in many studies. The use of fluoride releasing dental restorative materials has seen increasing from many years for the specific purpose of leaching of fluoride into the surrounding tissues to inhibit secondary dental caries as well as prevention of caries in the newly erupted tooth. In the dental caries, acidic environment causes the demineralization of tooth structure and also affect the restorative margins of dental restoration. various restorative materials show different behavior in different pH conditions of oral cavity. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the fluoride release of the various restorative materials at different pH. In this in vitro study, 30 samples of each dental restorative material were prepared and grouped into five with six samples in each group as per the pH of the solution 4.3, 4.6, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.2. All the samples were subjected to alternate cycling of the demineralizing solution (6 h) and remineralizing solution (18 h) for 15 days. the fluoride release was measured by using fluoride ion specific electrode and digital ion analyzer. The result showed that the fluoride release rate was significantly higher in first day and reduced after third day to nearly constant level. At pH 4.3, the fluoride release was highest and lowest at pH 6.2. the Amalgomer CR showed the highest fluoride release among all the experimental dental restorative materials. ","724":"Mechanical method of caries removal is associated with the removal of sound tooth structure, production of pain, heat, annoying sounds, and vibrations. Chemomechanical caries removal method is based on removal of only carious dentin leaving sound dentin intact. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of mechanical and chemomechanical methods of caries removal in deciduous and permanent teeth. A total of 30 carious teeth including 15 deciduous and 15 permanent teeth having dentinal caries selected randomly and cut into two halves through center of the lesion, were subjected to caries removal by mechanical (Group A), and chemomechanical methods (Group B). Time taken for removal of caries was noted with stopwatch. Samples were prepared and seen under the scanning electron microscope for the presence of bacterial colonies. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) Software. No significant difference was found for the presence of bacterial colonies in both groups of deciduous and permanent teeth; however, time taken for caries removal by the chemomechanical method was twice than the mechanical method. despite the insignificant presence of bacterial colonies and twice time taken as compared to mechanical method, chemomechanical method was easy to introduce, was painless, did not form smear layer and conserved the sound tooth structure. ","725":"oral sedation is the simplest and most convenient sedation method for managing uncooperative child patients because it is easy to administer and there is no need for nasal hood or injection. Oral midazolam is the most commonly used preanesthetic medication for children. When given in amounts between 0.5 and 0.75 mg\/kg of body weight, oral midazolam has been found to be an effective sedative agent for pediatric outpatients. Tramadol is a synthetic, centrally acting analgesic indicated for moderate to severe pain. Chloral hydrate is one of the sedatives most commonly used, has excellent absorption, fast induction, and exert minimal effects on respiration. zolpidem is the most commonly prescribed hypnotic due to its clinical efficacy, safety, and ability to be well tolerated with patients. 60 anxious and fearful children who reported to the department were treated under conscious sedation for the accomplishment of dental treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to four groups. Statistical analysis was done using Kruskal Wallis Test and decision criterion was to reject the null hypothesis if the P-value is less than 0.05. it was observed that there is a statistically significant difference in median scores recorded for the level of sedation between the different groups (P &lt; 0.001). this study concluded that midazolam is the best drug for producing conscious sedation followed by tramadol and triclofos. Zolpidem was not able to produce a sufficient level of sedation and it cannot be supported as a sedative agent at the present dosage.

Identification of children at a risk for developmental delay or related problems may lead to intervention and assistance at a young age, when the chances for improvement are the best. This rationale supports screening of preschool children for speech and language delay or primary language impairment or disorder, which needs to be integrated into routine developmental surveillance practices of clinicians caring for children.","727":"Pediatric dentistry in the current scenario is not just about teeth and gums that are easily visible in children's mouth anymore. It is all about those structures that are hidden, difficult to identify, and often remain undiagnosed. Dentist can come across various anomalies pertaining to the crown structure during the clinical practice. Although supernumerary tooth is the most commonly seen anomaly, the presence of extra roots in molars is an interesting example of anatomic root variation. It is well known that both primary and permanent mandibular first molars usually have roots, one mesial, and the other distal root. Very rarely an additional third root (supernumerary root) is seen and when it is located distolingually to the main distal root is called \"radix entomolaris (RE)\" and when it is placed mesiobuccaly to the mesial root is called \"radix paramolaris (RP).\" The purpose of this article is to discuss the prevalence, morphology, classification, clinical diagnosis, and significance of supernumerary roots in contemporary clinical pediatric dentistry.","728":"","729":"Oral submucous fibrosis is a chronic debilitating disorder which is usually seen in adults with areca nut chewing habit.

Developing class III patients with moderate to severe anterior crossbite and deep bite may need early intervention in some selected cases. Class III malocclusion may develop in children as a result of an inherent growth abnormality, i.e. true class III malocclusion, or as a result of premature occlusal contacts causing forward functional shift of the mandible, which is known as pseudo class III malocclusion. These cases, if not treated at the initial stage of development, interfere with normal growth of the jaw bases and may result in severe facial deformities. The treatment should be carried out as early as possible for permitting normal growth of the skeletal bases. This paper deals with the selection of an appropriate appliance from the various current options available for early intervention in developing class III malocclusion through two case reports.","731":"Osteoma is a benign osteogenic tumor arising from the proliferation of cancellous or compact bone. The osteoma can be central, peripheral, or of an extraskeletal type. Peripheral type of osteoma is most common in the lower jaws, which occurs at the surface of the cortical bone and is sessile or pedicled. The overall incidence of osteoma is low, affecting 0.01-0.04% of the population; osteomas comprise 12.1% of benign bone tumors and 2.9% of all bone tumors. Most of the osteomas occurring in the mandible are dense osteomas, and the cancellous osteoma is comparatively rare. Maxillofacial osteoma associated with cutaneous sebaceous cysts, multiple supernumerary teeth, and colorectal polyposis is known as Gardener's syndrome. However, in some cases, maxillofacial osteomas with multiple impacted and supernumerary teeth are not accompanied by a fixed complex of symptoms. We report one such case in a 15-year-old female patient.","732":"Defective enamel formation can be explained as defects occurring at the stages of enamel formation. Quantitative defects in matrix formation leads to hypoplastic form of amelogenesis imperfecta. Inadequate mineralization of matrix leads to hypocalcification and hypomaturation variants.

The majority of the patients with class II division 1 malocclusions have the presence of underlying skeletal discrepancy between maxilla and mandible. The treatment of skeletal class II division 1 depends upon the age of the patient, growth potential, severity of malocclusion, and compliance of patient with treatment. Myofunctional appliance can be successfully used to treat growing patients with class II division 1 malocclusion having retrusive mandible. This article presents a discussion on treatment of class II division 1 due to mandibular deficiency with growth modification approach using myofunctional appliances and a series of three case reports of treatment of skeletal class II division 1 malocclusion using myofunctional appliance followed by fixed mechanotherapy.","735":"The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate and compare the microleakage of pit and fissure sealants after using six different preparation techniques: (a) brush, (b) pumice slurry application, (c) bur, (d) air polishing, (e) air abrasion, and (f) longer etching time. The study was conducted on 60 caries-free first premolars extracted for orthodontic purpose. These teeth were randomly assigned to six groups of 10 teeth each. Teeth were prepared using one of six occlusal surface treatments prior to placement of Clinpro\" 3M ESPE light-cured sealant. The teeth were thermocycled for 500 cycles and stored in 0.9% normal saline. Teeth were sealed apically and coated with nail varnish 1 mm from the margin and stained in 1% methylene blue for 24 hours. Each tooth was divided buccolingually parallel to the long axis of the tooth, yielding two sections per tooth for analysis. The surfaces were scored from 0 to 2 for the extent of microleakage. Results obtained for microleakage were analyzed by using t-tests at sectional level and chi-square test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the group level. The results of round bur group were significantly superior when compared to all other groups. The application of air polishing and air abrasion showed better results than pumice slurry, bristle brush, and longer etching time. Round bur group was the most successful cleaning and preparing technique. Air polishing and air abrasion produced significantly less microleakage than traditional pumice slurry, bristle brush, and longer etching time. ","736":"To find out the nature of feeding practices among children with cleft lip and palate. A total of 155 subjects of less than 2 years of age with cleft lip and palate were chosen and divided into three groups according to their chronological age. Group I included 47 subjects (M=35, F=12) who were &lt;6 months old, Group II included 56 subjects (M=36, F=20) aged between 6 months and 1 year, and Group III included 52 subjects (M=28, F=24) of age between 1 and 2 years. Both the parents of the subjects with cleft lip and palate were interviewed and the details of the existing feeding practice were recorded on a standard pro forma. Chi-square test was applied to find out any significant difference in the feeding method between males and females. Spoon feeding was found as the most common feeding practice method. Breast feeding was the second most common feeding practice method among Group I subjects, whereas bottle feeding was the second most common feeding practice method among Group II and III subjects. The difference in the feeding practice between male and female subjects in all the three groups was very negligible and statistically not significant. Spoon feeding was found as the most common feeding method practiced by the parents of children with cleft lip and palate. ","737":"This study was done to compare and evaluate the compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, and microleakage of glass ionomer cement and chlorhexidine-modified glass ionomer cement. The glass ionomer cements used in the study were Fuji IX for group I and chlorhexidine-modified glass ionomer cement for group II. The strength characteristics (compressive and diametral tensile strengths) and microleakage of both the groups were evaluated after 24 h. Student's \"t\" test and Mann-Whitney test were used for statistical analysis of the difference in strength characteristics and microleakage. There was no statistical difference (P&gt;0.05) in the strength characteristics and microleakage of glass ionomer cement and chlorhexidine-modified glass ionomer cement. The present study suggests that strength characteristics and marginal sealing capability of chlorhexidine-modified glass ionomer cement were similar to those of glass ionomer cement (Fuji IX). So, chlorhexidine-modified glass ionomer can be considered as a substitute for glass ionomer cements, especially in pediatric dentistry. ","738":"The aim was to assess the characteristics and outcomes of infections affecting the structures of carious primary molars. Forty primary molars were used and classified according to the following clinical situation: With profound caries lesion, with bone loss at the furcation region, with perforation of the pulp chamber floor, and residual roots. The teeth were demineralized, cut, and stained with both haematoxylin-eosin and Brown and Brenn staining techniques. Assessment was performed using optical microscopy. Statistical analysis of the data by means of the Chi-square test suggests that there was a significant relationship (P&lt;0.001) between the intensity and localization of infection and the level of destruction of dental structures. A significant difference was also observed in the intensity and localization of infection between the groups regarding crown, furca, and root (P&lt;0.001). More intense and profound the infection, more severe is the dental destruction. The groups of residual roots showed the most severe bacterial infection compared to other groups.

ArGo-GoMe (P=0.003) and (P&lt;0.011) for 6-9 and 9-12 years age group, respectively, were significantly low in nasal breathers group. Changed mode of respiration was associated with increased facial height, mandibular plane angle and gonial angle. ","740":"This in vitro study was conducted to find out the effect of retentive groove, sand blasting and cement type on the retentive strength of stainless steel crowns in primary second molars. Thirty-two extracted intact human maxillary and mandibular primary second molars were embedded in aluminum blocks utilizing autopolymerising acrylic resin. After tooth preparation, the 3M stainless steel crown was adjusted to the prepared tooth. Then weldable buccal tubes were welded on the buccal and lingual surfaces of each crown as an attachment for the testing machine. A full factorial design matrix for four factors (retentive groove placement on the tooth, cement type, sandblasting and primary second molar) at two levels each was developed and the study was conducted as dictated by the matrix. The lower and upper limits for each factor were without and with retentive groove placement on the tooth, GIC and RMGIC, without and with sandblasting of crown, maxillary and mandibular second primary molar. For those teeth for which the design matrix dictated groove placement, the retentive groove was placed on the middle third of the buccal surface of the tooth horizontally and for those crowns for which sandblasting of the crowns are to be done, sandblasting was done with aluminium oxide with a particle size of 250 mm. The crowns were luted with either GIC or RMGIC, as dictated by the design matrix. Then the retentive strength of each sample was evaluated by means of an universal testing machine. The obtained data was analyzed using ANOVA for statistical analysis of the data and 't'- tests for pairwise comparison. The mean retentive strength in kg\/cm 2 stainless steel crowns luted with RMGIC was 19.361 and the mean retentive strength of stainless steel crowns luted with GIC was 15.964 kg\/cm 2 with a mean difference of 3.397 kg\/cm 2 and was statistically significant. The mean retentive strength in kg\/cm 2 of stainless steel crowns, which was not sandblasted, was 18.880 and which was sandblasted was 16.445 kg\/cm 2 with a mean difference of 2.436 kg\/cm 2 . These results were again statistically significant. It was found that the crowns luted with resin-modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC's) offered better retentive strength of crowns than glass ionomer cements (GIC) and stainless steel crowns which were cemented without sandblasting showed higher mean retentive strength than with sandblasting of crowns. The presence of groove did not influence the retentive strength of stainless steel crowns. ","741":"The aim of the study was to outline a simple, cost-effective technique for obturation of primary tooth root canals. A total of 75 primary teeth were treated in 52 subjects by the technique discussed, i.e. injecting plastic flowable material into the root canals after desired preparation, using disposable needle and syringe. All the patients were followed up for 3 years and 6 months, with no clinical or radiologic evidence of pathology or need for untimely extraction. In conclusion, the technique described is simple, economical, can be used with almost all filling materials used for the purpose, and is easy to master with minimal chances of failure.","742":"To assess the plaque and salivary pH changes at different time intervals in vivo after consumption of a carbonated beverage modified with sodium fluoride and calcium phosphate. Twenty-four subjects aged 18-25 years were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups (group A, original drink Sprite; group B, Sprite with sodium fluoride; group C, Sprite with calcium phosphate). Collection of pooled plaque and unstimulated saliva was done before and after the drinks were consumed by the subjects at 5-, 10-, 20- and 30-minute intervals. The pH rise was higher with group C for plaque and group B for saliva. Modification of the test carbonated beverage with calcium phosphate and fluoride may exert some protective potential, especially in high caries risk candidates. ","743":"The goal of modern dentistry is to manage non-cavitated carious lesions non-invasively through remineralization in an attempt to prevent disease progression, and to improve strength, esthetics, and function of teeth. The emphasis currently is being given to new technologies for enamel remineralization which suggest the changes in the understanding of dental caries. The aim of this paper is to review the contemporary non-fluoridated systems available for remineralization therapy and ideas for their implementation into clinical practice. A search of articles from \"Pubmed\" and \"Medline\" with the keywords Remineralization-demineralization, Casein derivatives, Non-fluoridated remineralizing agents was conducted. A total of 526 abstracts were collected, out of which 172 articles that discussed current technologies of non-fluoridated remineralizing agents were read and 33 most relevant articles were included in this paper.

Pulp necrosis is the commonly observed sequel in traumatized primary teeth and is one of the possible etiologic factors for the development of dentigerous cyst. Dentigerous cyst is more commonly seen in mandibular third molar and maxillary canine region and is rarely associated with other teeth. This article addresses a case of dentigerous cyst associated with the germ of upper permanent central incisor, an uncommon site of occurrence, which was impacted, dislodged from its natural site of eruption after trauma to the predecessor incisor.","746":"Self-injurious behavior is a deliberate alteration or damage without suicidal intent. Herein, we report a patient who had caused intentionally self-trauma to his left lower permanent canine and placed a long metallic foreign body into the root canal. History revealed a habit of placing metallic objects in the form of stapler pins into the mouth, but closer examination revealed the habit to be more as a method of self-injurious behavior. Following an episode of severe pain, the tooth was endodontically treated after removal of the foreign body that was corroding. Clinical significance of the case report is that the patient may just be put off as having a habit of inserting foreign objects into the mouth, but the behavior was more self-injurious in nature.","747":"Palatal radicular groove is a discreet alteration in tooth morphology, characterized by an invagination that begins near the cingulum of the tooth and moves in an apical direction. Clinically, palatal radicular groove may be associated with periodontal and\/or endodontic problems. This paper describes a clinical case of a young patient with palatal radicular groove with no signs of periodontal disease or endodontic impairment. An early diagnosis was made and treatment consisted of surgical sealing of the defect. After a 2-year period, reexaminations demonstrated adequate hygiene, maintenance of tooth vitality and periodontal health. The early diagnosis and sealing of the groove observed surgically made the root surface smooth, avoiding subgingival bacterial plaque buildup, and preventing possible periodontal and\/or pulp impairment stemming from the defect.","748":"Mucormycosis is one of the most rapidly progressing and lethal form of fungal infections in humans which usually begins in the nose and paranasal sinuses. The fungus assaults the arteries, leading to thrombosis that subsequently causes necrosis of hard and soft tissues.

OFD syndrome type I, also known as the Papillon-League-Psaume syndrome warrants our attention because early diagnosis from an odontologic viewpoint will minimize the sequalae of developing physical and dental abnormalities. The present article highlights the clinical as well as the radiographic findings and the treatment that was done of a 10-year-old girl child diagnosed with OFD I.","750":"Child abuse and neglect are important public health problems and recent estimates of their prevalence suggest that they are considerably more common than had hitherto been realized. Intervening to change parenting practices may, however, be important in their treatment. Despite their frequent occurrence among dental patients, neglect is the least known and identified type of abuse. The present case reports a 3-year-old girl suffering from abuse and neglect. The girl had dental neglect and also performed poorly in all parameters of growth and development. This case describes the process that was followed in order to reach a diagnosis and safeguard the child. The parent was counseled and the girl got her due share of access to comprehensive oral and general health. This case emphasizes that the dental professional should always be vigilant and collaborates among like-minded individuals to increase the prevention, detection and treatment of these conditions.","751":"Ameloblastoma is the most common aggressive benign odontogenic tumor of the jaws. The tumor is often asymptomatic, presenting as a slowly enlarging facial swelling. The physical presence of the tumor may cause symptoms such as pain, ulceration, loosening of teeth, or malocclusion. Ameloblastoma is a locally destructive tumor with a propensity for recurrence if not entirely excised. It is seen in all age groups, but the lesion is most commonly diagnosed in the third and fourth decades. The tumor is considered a rarity in the young age group. The treatment of ameloblastoma is still controversial and presents some special problems in children like the growth of the jaw, the different incidence, behavior and prognosis of the tumor in children, which make the surgical considerations different from adults. Some reports have encouraged conservative treatment for ameloblastoma in children.","752":"The presence of nasal air leak in cleft palate patients with velopharyngeal incompetence leads to characteristic nasal snort. The efficacy of the palatal lift appliance in patients with adequate velopharyngeal tissue with incompetence was tested. Speech quality improved after the wearing of palatal lift appliance.

It is an under-recognized rather than a very rare condition among patients with large facial hemangiomas. It is challenging as it has significant neurological, vascular and airway implications. Vascular malformations compromising cerebral blood flow predispose the patient to strokes and seizures. Subglottic hemangiomas, if present, could bleed during intubation. Meticulous neurological monitoring is mandatory in those undergoing repair of the great vessels. We describe the perioperative management of a child with PHACE syndrome subjected to dental treatment under general anesthesia.","754":"Leiomyoma is a benign smooth muscle tumor that rarely affects children and occurs most frequently in the uterine myometrium and gastrointestinal tract. Its occurrence in the oral cavity is considered rare probably because of the scarcity of smooth muscle tissue in the oral cavity. The most common intraoral sites for leiomyoma are lips, palate and tongue. The purpose of this case report is to present the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of a rare case of oral leiomyoma in a 13-year-old girl with a 4-month history of a swelling in her left mandibular area extending from first molar to retromolar region.","755":"Odontodysplasia is a rare, non-hereditary developmental anomaly affecting dental tissues derived from both the mesoderm and ectoderm which results in a bizarre clinical and radiographic appearance.

The aim of this study was to reposition the shifted premaxilla for better retraction with presurgical infant orthopedics, thus reducing the tissue tension and further scarring which have detrimental effects on maxillary growth. The innovative technique with pre-directional (PD) appliance is easy to fabricate and use and works in this direction. Acrylic, springs, permasoft liner, elastics, retentive tapes. Previous approach for the shifted premaxilla was more focused on the surgical correction. In adults, surgery with osteotomy is the only option, with its own limitations and disadvantages, in repositioning the shifted premaxilla. Thus, PD appliance aids to correct the shifted premaxilla in presurgical molding stage. The premaxilla was thus shifted 5.5 mm to the left side, with premaxilla in facial symmetry, with the PD appliance. Presurgical orthopedics with PD appliance is worth in infants with shifted premaxilla in bilateral clefts cases.","760":"Temporomandibular joint dislocations are extremely rare in children and only four such cases have been reported in the literature so far. However, a case of recurrent bilateral mandibular dislocation is even rare to occur and a report of one such case is presented in this article.","761":"Most foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract uneventfully. The majority of the reported literature describes the management of ingested blunt objects. However, ingestion of sharp objects can still occur with a higher rate of perforation corresponding to treatment dilemmas. We report a case of inadvertently ingested sharp foreign body by a special child, which was retrieved by endoscopic guided forceps. Urgent endoscopic assessment and retrieval of recently ingested sharp dental foreign body is indicated and routine use of preventive measures such as rubber dam, gauze throat screens or floss ligatures is suggested.","762":"This report describes the case of a 13-year-old Indian boy with popliteal pterygium syndrome. The popliteal pterygium syndrome is an extremely rare hereditary disorder thought to occur with an incidence of approximately 1 in 300000 live births. It is a congenital malformation syndrome affecting the face, limbs, and genitalia with highly characteristic features, including popliteal webbing, cleft palate (with or without cleft lip), lower lip pits, syndactyly, and genital and nail anomalies. This patient was referred to our department because of complaints of pain in the mouth and poor oral health. The orofacial findings included cleft lip, cleft palate, lower lip pits, a few missing teeth, and severely decayed teeth. In this syndrome, the orodental problems are overshadowed by the major syndromic manifestations but nevertheless need appropriate management. These patients have special dental needs and early diagnosis of the affected children is therefore important in order to initiate preventive dental care and carry out appropriate dental treatment at the optimal time.","763":"An acceptable treatment approach for early childhood caries in the past may not necessarily be the best treatment option for our young patients today. Technological advances in dental materials and the approach to their use need to be considered, and the introduction of new adhesive systems, restorative materials, and the approach toward treating these teeth has yielded convincing results. Two such clinical case reports where polyethylene fibers were used as intra-canal posts and to splint the pontic fabricated with polyethylene fibers reinforced composite are reported.","764":"Regional odontodysplasia is an unusual developmental anomaly in which ectodermal and mesodermal tooth components are affected. We present a rare case of a developmental anomaly called regional odontodysplasia or 'ghost teeth' in a 12-year-old Indian girl. The anomaly affected right maxillary permanent teeth.

The abnormalities found in this syndrome change too much from case to case depending on the suture fusion order. We report a case of a 12 year old child and a mother showing variations in the dentofacial tissues clinically and radiographically. Subsequently, the application of digital software [Dolphin Imaging 11] enabled us to solve out the case as Crouzon syndrome by analyzing the skeletal and soft tissue alterations. An update of the effects of this syndrome on various systems and dentofacial features with emphasis on tooth abnormalities is documented.","767":"The prevalence of dental caries in children, in India, is higher than many of the industrialized countries. The sugar most commonly associated with dental caries is sucrose, as the microorganisms in the dental plaque have the ability to convert this dietary constituent into various organic acids. This study was conducted to study the effect of the presence of plaque on the salivary clearance of sucrose and to study the effect of the presence of plaque on salivary pH, following sucrose clearance. Salivary sucrose determination was done by using the anthrone technique. A Digital MHOS pH meter estimated the salivary pH. Presence of plaque increased the salivary sucrose clearance time and decreased the salivary pH at various time intervals. The microbial etiology of dental caries is the dynamic relationship among the dental plaque microbiota, dietary carbohydrates, saliva and pH lowering, and the cariogenic potential of the dental plaque. Caries occur preferentially in the dentition sites characterized by high exposure to carbohydrate and diminished salivary effect. ","768":null,"769":"The purpose of this study was to compare the Working length in primary teeth endodontics using intra oral digital radiovisiography and apex locator with conventional method for accuracy. This in vivo study was conducted on 30 primary teeth which were indicated for pulpectomy in the patients of the age group of 5-11 years All experimental teeth had adequate remaining tooth structure for rubber dam isolation and radiographicaly visible canals. Endodontic treatment was required due to irreversible pulpitis or pulp necrosis. A standardized intraoral periapical radiograph of the tooth was taken using conventional method by paralleling technique. The distance between the source and the tooth, tooth and the films were standardized using X-ray positioning device. During the pulpectomy procedure, the working length was determined by digital radiograph and apex locator. The measurements were then compared with the conventional method of root canal measurement technique for accuracy. From the results obtained we can conclude that Working length determined in primary molars using digital radiography and Apex locator did not show any significant difference in the mean working length measurements when compared with the conventional radiographic method. Apex locator is comparable to conventional radiograph in determining the working length without radiation in the primary teeth. Intraoral digital radiography is the safest method in determining the working length with significant reduction in radiation exposure.Hence, both the techniques can be safely used as alternatives to conventional radiographic methods in determining working length in primary teeth. ","770":"Dental caries affects populations of all ages in all the regions of the world, with the child patient being at the highest risk. Fifty percent of the permanent molars are decayed by the age of 12, due to lack of information about protection and occlusal morphology. Pit and fissure sealing undoubtedly plays a fundamental role in preventing occlusal caries. The most common approach to assess the sealing ability of pit and fissure sealants of tooth\/restoration is the measurement of dye penetration along the interface. The present study aims to evaluate the microleakage and penetration depth of three different types of dental materials, namely (A) Conventional pit and fissure sealant, (B) Flowable composite, (C) Flowable nanocomposite. This in-vitro comparative study comprised of extracted human posterior teeth mounted as blocks. In the present study, microleakage and penetration depths of conventional sealants\/flowable composite and nanocomposite were measured with the help of a dye under stereomicroscope. A student't' test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were performed to compare the mean microleakage and penetration depth. Microleakage was found to be highest for the flowable composites, and least for the conventional sealant. The nanocomposite values were intermediate. Penetration depth was highest for nanocomposite and least for flowable composite. According to the results, the nanocomposite was found to be an excellent dental material for penetration in deep pits and fissures, though it exhibits mild microleakage. Hence, it can be recommended for use in pediatric dental patients, as a pit and fissure sealing agent. ","771":"'Mesiodens' are the supernumerary teeth present in the midline of the maxilla between the two central incisors. These mesiodens are the most common supernumerary teeth and are usually responsible for eruption disturbance or delay of the maxillary anterior permanent teeth. The present study seeks to investigate the prevalence of mesiodens among school going children in Indore City, India. The study was a retrospective collection of data to evaluate the prevalence of mesiodens among 3896 children, whose ages ranged between six and seventeen years. The results showed that males were affected approximately 1.2 times as frequently as females; 3.18% of the total screened population had mesiodens and among the affected population 4.03% had two or more mesiodens. Most of the mesiodens were conical in shape. The age, sex distribution, number of mesiodens per patient, shape, and direction of the eruption are presented in this study. The present study gives an insight into the prevalence of mesiodens among school going children of Indore city. A coincidental finding in our study has been the high risk of trauma associated with the occurence of mesiodens. This finding makes it mandatory to include mesiodens as a risk factor in traumatic dental injuries. Early diagnosis and management of these otherwise considered mild factors must be made mandatory in pediatric dentistry. ","772":"Antibiotics are commonly used in dentistry for prophylactic as well as for therapeutic purposes. Most often antibiotics are used in unwarranted situations, which may give rise to resistant bacterial strains. Dentists want to make their patients well and to prevent unpleasant complications. These desires, coupled with the belief that many oral problems are infectious, stimulate the prescribing of antibiotics. Good knowledge about the indications of antibiotics is the need of the hour in prescribing antibiotics for dental conditions.","773":"","774":"The following case report describes the management of a 6-year-old male patient in early mixed dentition with a mesial step molar relation, an anterior reverse overjet, and skeletal Class III due to a slightly deficient maxilla.

The ectopic gland located at the base of the tongue is often asymptomatic but may cause local symptoms such as dysphagia, dysphonia with stomatolalia, upper airway obstruction and haemorrhage, often with hypothyroidism. One case is presented, in a 5 year-old girl patient, who complained of sensation of a foreign body and progressive dysphagia and dyspnoea caused by ectopic lingual thyroid. The diagnosis of lingual thyroid is usually made clinically and radionuclide scanning is used to confirm the diagnosis. In this case report, presentation, diagnosis and management of this condition is highlighted.","776":"Gingival enlargement is quite a common pathology in pediatric patients and may be inflammatory, noninflammatory, or a combination of both. Idiopathic gingival fibromatosis, although rare, is a slowly progressive benign enlargement that affects the marginal gingiva, attached gingival, and interdental papilla. The fibromatosis may potentially cover the exposed tooth surfaces, causing esthetic and functional problems. The treatment of gingival fibromatosis is essential because it causes difficulties with mastication, speech problems, mispositioning of teeth, esthetic effects, and psychological difficulties for the patient. Traditional gingivectomy procedures have been a challenge for dentists who confront issues of patient cooperation and discomfort. In the last decade, laser procedures in oral cavity had shown many optimum effects in both hard and soft tissue procedures. Laser soft-tissue surgery has been shown to be well accepted by children. The following case report describes a laser-assisted gingivectomy procedure performed on a 13-year-old female.","777":"The aim was to compare the vertex occlusal projection with the anterior maxillary occlusal projection in localizing the position of mesiodentes. Mesiodentes were observed in an 8-year-old boy with an anterior maxillary occlusal radiograph. A vertex occlusal radiograph was taken to compare it with the former in terms of mesiodentes localization with respect to the maxillary central incisors. The vertex occlusal radiograph provided greater details of the position and proximity of mesiodentes with respect to the long axis of maxillary central incisors in comparison to the anterior maxillary occlusal radiograph. Vertex occlusal radiography is an important diagnostic tool in diagnosing the presence, position, and proximity of mesiodentes with respect to the long axis of normally aligned maxillary central incisors. However, it is not recommended for routine use in a patient as its radiation dose is higher than conventional intraoral radiographic methods.","778":"Many types of localized reactive lesions may occur on the gingiva, including focal fibrous hyperplasia, pyogenic granuloma, peripheral giant cell granuloma and peripheral ossifying fibroma. Peripheral ossifying fibroma is a gingival growth, usually arising from interdental papilla and represents up to 2% of all lesions that are biopsied. Other terms used to describe this lesion include peripheral cementifying fibroma, peripheral fibroma with cementogenesis, peripheral fibroma with osteogenesis, peripheral fibroma with calcification, calcified or ossified fibrous epulis and calcified fibroblastic granuloma. This article reports a case of a 10 year old male child with an unusually large peripheral ossifying fibroma in the left maxillary alveolar ridge which showed recurrence after the surgical treatment.","779":"Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant disorder that presents with skeletal dysplasia.

","787":"Fruit juices are popular worldwide with children of all ages as they are sweet and perceived to be healthful. This in vitro study was sought to measure pH of 10 different fruit juices, to find out possible erosive effects on human dental enamel of 40 extracted sound premolars and also to measure fluoride and trace elements of these juices. The estimation of pH of fruit juices was done by using Systronic upH 362 pH meter. The erosive effects of fruit juices were tested by using polarized light microscope. Orion electrode was used to measure fluoride. The trace elements were estimated by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer No. 6501F. The pH values in different juices were observed at different levels, and pH values of these juices were more acidic than baseline after 24 hours. As the time increased, the erosion effect became more in pineapple; grape and sugarcane juices, and they had more cariogenic trace elements like selenium, iron and manganese. So, these juices were found to be cariogenic. To conclude, orange, mousambi, mango, pomegranate, apple, chikku and watermelon juices had no erosive effect on the human enamel, with the presence of highest amount of trace elements like fluoride and phosphorous which are considered as strongly cariostatic.","788":"In addition to their fluoride-releasing properties, glass ionomer cement (GICs) have the ability to reuptake and release fluorides from commonly used sources like fluoridated dentifrices. This property has the potential to provide a continuous low concentration of fluoride in the saliva aiding in caries prevention. The superior fluoride-recharging abilities of resin-modified GICs over conventional GICs have been documented. The manufacturer of a non-resin, auto-cured GIC (GC Fuji VII) claims fluoride release from the product to be about six times that of conventional GIC. It was hypothesized that perhaps this high fluoride release could translate into a high reuptake and release, when exposed to a 1 000 ppm fluoridated dentifrice every day, thus providing increased fluoride levels in saliva. This study therefore examined fluoride-recharging abilities of the non-resin, auto-cured glass ionomer cement from a 1 000 ppm fluoridated dentifrice and compared it with resin-modified glass ionomer cement. Twelve glass ionomer discs each of resin-modified glass ionomer cement (GC Fuji II L C, Group 1) and the non-resin, auto-cured glass ionomer cement (GC Fuji VII, Group 2) were prepared with precise dimensions of 9 x 2 mm. The 12 specimens in each group were further subdivided into two subgroups of six each. Subgroup A involved no fluoride treatment (Control). Subgroup B involved application of a 1 000 ppm dentifrice for 2 minutes twice daily with a soft toothbrush. The disc-specimens were then suspended in airtight plastic bottles containing exactly 20 ml double distilled water. The fluoride concentration of the water in which the specimen discs were immersed was measured by means of a fluoride ion selective electrode connected to an ion selective electrode meter\/digital ion analyzer at 1, 2, 7, 15, and 30 days. It was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis Test. Fuji VII, despite a high fluoride release, did not significantly recharge when exposed to a 1 000 ppm fluoridated dentifrice.

","791":"Epilepsy denotes any disorder characterized by recurrent seizures due to abnormal paroxysmal neuronal discharge in the brain. Symptoms range from sensory absences to convulsive movements and loss of consciousness. Antiepileptic drugs are the first line of treatment. However, 20% individuals with epilepsy have drug-resistant seizures despite optimal treatment. For those with refractory epilepsy, the ketogenic diet is an effective alternative therapeutic approach. The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and adequate-protein diet that mimics the biochemical effects of fasting. There are many disparate mechanistic theories of how this diet protects against seizures. Key insights indicate that it has effects on intermediary metabolism that influence the dynamics of the major inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter systems in brain. This paper discusses the implicitly significant and diverse biochemical changes affected by this unique therapeutic approach that may have a bearing on oral health and the delivery of dental care to individuals with refractory epilepsy.","792":"","793":"Anterior crown fractures are a common form of injury that mainly affect children and adolescents. The position of maxillary incisors and their eruptive pattern carries a significant risk for trauma. In the pre-adhesive era, fractured teeth needed to be restored either with pin-retained inlays or cast restorations that sacrificed healthy tooth structure, and were a challenge for clinicians to match with adjacent teeth. The development of adhesive dentistry has allowed dentists to use the patient's own fragment to restore the fractured tooth.

Seventy-five maxillary and mandibular primary molar root canals were instrumented with ProFiles and K-files in the step-back manner from size #10 to #40. The teeth were decalcified, dehydrated and cleared, and analyzed for the presence of dye remaining on the root canal walls, which served as an evidence of cleaning capacity of both the techniques. The results showed a significant difference in the cleaning capacity of the root canals with ProFiles and K-files, in apical and coronal thirds of the root canal. ProFiles have been found to be more efficient in cleaning the coronal thirds and K-files in cleaning apical thirds of the root canals. Both the techniques were almost equally effective in cleaning the middle thirds of the canals. The time taken during the cleaning of the root canals appeared to be statistically shorter with K-files than profiles.

It presents with a classic triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate. In a neonate with a complete cleft palate, problems with feeding are commonly encountered. Presented here are two cases with PRS in whom palatal obturators were constructed.","832":"Apert syndrome (acrocephalosyndactyly) is a rare developmental malformation characterized by craniosynostosis, mid-face hypoplasia, symmetrical syndactyly of hands and feet. The prodromal characteristics for the typical cranio-facial appearance are early craniosynostosis of the coronal suture, cranial base and agenesis of the sagittal suture. The purpose of this paper is to report a case of Apert syndrome with emphasis on craniofacial and oral features in an eighteen-month-old male child. The patient presented with several craniofacial deformities, including brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia, flat face, hypertelorism, ocular proptosis, downslanting palpebral fissures. Syndactylies with osseous fusion of the hands and feet were also observed. Intraoral findings included delayed eruption of teeth, high arched palate with pseudo cleft in the posterior one third.","833":"Idiopathic agenesis of primary dentition is very rare. This is a case report of a 2-year and 6-month-old girl child who presented with 14 missing primary teeth. A review of the previous case reports is done and the management of these cases is discussed.","834":"Regional odontodysplasia (ROD) is a rare developmental anomaly involving both mesodermal and ectodermal components in a group of contiguous teeth. It affects the primary and permanent dentitions in the maxilla and the mandible or both, however, the maxilla is frequently involved. Although the etiology of the ROD is uncertain, it has been suggested that numerous other factors play a role. The treatment plan should be based on the degree of involvement as well as the functional and esthetic needs in each case. This article reports the case of a 5-year-old boy presenting a rare anomaly on the right side of the maxillary arch. The treatment performed was rehabilitation with temporary partial acrylic denture and periodic checkups. The extraction was followed by rehabilitation with dental implants. The main aim of this article is to provide valuable information to pediatric dentists about the review and treatment alternatives for ROD.","835":"Cleft lip and palate is a birth defect occurring in the orofacial region. One of the immediate problems to be addressed in a newborn with this defect would be to aid in suckling and swallowing. Here we present a case of a 5-day-old infant with unilateral cleft lip and palate for whom feeding obturator was made by using a simplified impression technique to facilitate feeding.","836":"Everyone likes to see, hear, and know about rare things. An aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is an uncommon non-neoplastic lesion of the bone, mostly affecting long bones and spine. This rare jaw lesion usually affects the mandible but origin from the maxillary anterior region is even rarer. This paper describes a case of an ABC in an 8-year-old female child with a progressively increasing swelling in the right nasomaxillary region developed over a period of 1.5 months. Treatment consisted of the excision and enucleation of the lesion through an intraoral approach under general anesthesia. The higher prevalence in young adulthood has made the role of pedodontists vital in diagnosing ABCs, at the earliest.","837":"Rickets is the failure of mineralization of osteoid and newly formed bones in a child skeleton. It is commonly associated with vitamin D deficiency; however, it can be because of a decrease in the serum phosphate levels leading to inadequate mineralization of cartilage and bone, consequent skeletal deformities, and growth retardation. The hypophosphatemic conditions that interfere in bone mineralization comprise many hereditary or acquired diseases. One of the hereditary types of hypophosphatemic rickets is the familial hypophosphatemic rickets. This rare variety was diagnosed in a 9-year-old patient who had come with a chief complaint of a missing tooth. In the present case, radiographic aspects of oral and systemic manifestations of familial hypophosphatemic rickets are highlighted.","838":"Psoriasis is a common dermatological disease. It can occur at any age but usually develops between 15 and 35 years of age and may persist throughout a person's lifetime with periods of exacerbation and remission. The hyperproliferative state of the affected epidermis produces a turnover rate that is up to eight times greater than normal. Instead of being shed, the skin cells pile up, causing the visible lesions. Oral manifestations of psoriasis are rare clinical observations. Lesions have been reported on the lips, buccal mucosa, palate, gingiva, and floor of the mouth. We document a presentation of psoriasis showing a triad: skin lesions, arthritis, and oral manifestations (oligodontia being patient's chief concern). Dental rehabilitation done was in the form of partial dentures. This was done to address the immediate concern of the patient, that is, inability to chew properly. As put forth through this case report, a potential link between psoriasis and oligodontia has scope for further study.","839":"Peripheral giant cell granuloma is a benign reactive lesion of gingiva.

Internal resorption is one among them. There are several treatment protocols advised for this pathological condition. A crown-root fracture is defined as a fracture involving enamel, dentin and cementum and accounts for 5% of all traumatic injuries to the permanent dentition. In anterior teeth, these fractures are usually caused by direct trauma and often complicated in fully erupted teeth. In cases where the fracture line extends down along the long axis of the root, extraction of the tooth is indicated. The purpose of this report is to present the use of light transmitting post system to reinforce the crown root fractured maxillary central incisor due to trauma and internal resorption.","841":"Children under the age of 5 years generally spend most of their time with their parents and guardians, especially mothers, even when they attend pre-schools or nurseries. It has been found that young children's oral health maintenance and outcomes are influenced by their parent's knowledge and beliefs. This study was done to assess the mother's knowledge about the oral health of their pre-school children in Moradabad, India. Mothers of children aged 1-4 years, attending the hospital for vaccination or regular checkups in the pediatric division of government hospitals, were invited to participate in the study. A 20-item questionnaire covering socio-demographic characteristics, dietary practices, oral hygiene practices and importance of deciduous teeth, was distributed to their mothers, during their visit to the hospital. Responses of the mothers were recorded on a Likert Scale. The sample comprised 406 mothers, with the mean age of children being 3.8 years. Three hundred (73.8%) mothers had a good knowledge about diet and dietary practices, while only 110 (27.1%) and 103 (25.4%) mothers were found to have a good knowledge about the importance of oral hygiene practices and importance of deciduous teeth, respectively. Mothers with higher educational qualification and information gained through dentist had a better knowledge about child's oral health. Oral hygiene habits and dietary habits are established during pre-school days and the parents, especially mothers, function as role models for their children.","842":"The present study is undertaken to find out the pH of resting plaque in children with no caries, moderate caries and rampant caries and to determine the modulations of plaque pH with different sugar solution rinses viz: sucrose, glucose and fructose. The study was carried out on forty five children, in the age group of 3-10 years (25 males and 20 females). The child was given 10 ml of test solution and was asked to rinse and swish it in the mouth for a period of 30 sec. Plaque samples were taken from 20 different spots after 5, 10, 20 and 30 min of the rinse and pH values of all the samples were determined. Results show that there was a statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) difference between the pH values of plaque at different intervals of time with sucrose, fructose and glucose solution rinse in children with moderate caries, rampant caries as compared to the caries free group. Sucrose was found to be highly cariogenic in all the children with a greater potentiating effect in moderate and rampant caries. Glucose also appeared to have a cariogenic role while fructose had the least of it all.","843":"The purpose of this in-vitro study is to determine the efficacy of various irrigants in removing the smear layer in primary teeth root canals after hand instrumentation. The present study consisted of 30 human primary incisors which were sectioned at the cementoenamel junction horizontally. The specimens were divided randomly into four experimental and one control group having six teeth each and each group was treated with the specific irrigant. 5.25% NaOCl, 5.25% NaOCl + 10% EDTA, 6% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine, saline (control) were the irrigants evaluated for efficacy in removal of smear layer. The specimens were split along the longitudinal axis using a chisel after placing superficial grooves in cementum not extending to the root canal. The exposed surface was subjected to scanning electron microscopic analysis to reveal the efficacy of irrigants in removal of smear layer. The representative areas were evaluated twice at 15 days interval by a single evaluator. The scale for the smear layer removal by Rome et al was modified and used in the present study. The pictures from the scanning electron microscopy showed that among the tested irrigants, citric acid has the best efficacy to remove the smear layer without altering the normal dentinal structures, which was supported by the lowest mean smear scores. The pictures from the 10%EDTA + 5.25% sodium hypochlorite group showed that even though it removed the smear layer, it adversely affected the dentine structure. SEM pictures of the other groups like sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine revealed that these irrigants does not have the capacity to remove the smear layer in primary teeth. The results of the present study clearly indicate the superior efficacy of 6% citric acid than the other tested irrigants on removing the smear layer in primary teeth root canals. ","844":"Remineralization process is accelerated by the presence of fluoride ions in the oral environment, but this mechanism of caries reversal will be further enhanced if the concentration of calcium, phosphate and fluoride ions is supersaturated with respect to that of oral fluids. This in vivo study was carried out to evaluate and compare the remineralizing efficacy of a urea-based mineral-enriched mouthrinse and a fluoridated dentifrice using an in vivo intraoral appliance model and polarized light microscopic evaluation technique. The specimens were prepared from sound teeth and artificial caries was produced using an artificial caries medium in vitro and enamel specimens were inserted in removable orthodontic appliances that were to be worn by 14 children of 10-15 years of age. They were divided into three groups - nonfluoridated dentifrice, fluoridated dentifrice and mineral-enriched mouthrinse groups. After the 6-month experimental period, during which the enamel specimens inserted in the intraoral appliance were subjected to one of the agents (either fluoride, nonfluoride dentifrice or mouthrinse) in vivo, the specimens were retrieved from the patients and were evaluated using the polarized light microscopic technique. On analysis, mineral gain occurred in all groups, viz. nonfluoride dentifrice group, fluoride dentifrice and mineral-enriched mouthrinse group. However, it was found to be complete in the mouthrinse group, i.e. both at the surface and at the subsurface (67%), while in the fluoridated dentifrice group, 43% of the samples showed mineral gain in both zones. In the nonfluoridated dentifrice group also, remineralization occurred but was limited either to the surface or the subsurface zone. Urea-based mineral-enriched mouthrinse was shown to be more efficacious in the process of remineralization of artificial carious lesions. ","845":"A study was conducted to evaluate and compare the effect of cavity disinfectants on the fracture resistance of primary molars restored with indirect composite inlays. Thirty-six non-carious primary second molars were selected and divided randomly into three groups (n = 12): control group (no disinfectant), chlorhexidine group (disinfected with 2% chlorhexidine for 40 seconds) and sodium hypochlorite group crowns (disinfected with 2% chlorhexidine for 40 seconds). The inlays were fabricated by indirect method using Ceram X nanocomposite on plaster die. All the groups were submitted to compression mechanic test in a Hounsfield universal testing machine at 1 mm\/min cross-head speed and the results were calculated in Newtons. Descriptive statistics, independent t test, and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test revealed the mean fracture resistance of three groups, i.e., control group, chlorhexidine group and sodium hypochlorite group to be 2260.66, 1858.08 and 1310.66, respectively. When intragroup comparisons were made, a significant difference was observed in all the groups (P&lt;0.001). Scheffe's post hoc test revealed that control group had the highest fracture resistance, followed by chlorhexidine group, and sodium hypochlorite group had the least fracture resistance. Each value differed significantly from the other (P&lt;0.05). Cavity disinfectants used in the present study had detrimental effect on the fracture resistance of primary molars. Among the disinfectants employed in the present study, chlorhexidine showed a better resistance to fracture than sodium hypochlorite.","846":"Microbes are considered as the primary etiological agents in endodontic diseases. The ways of reducing these agents are root canal debridement, antimicrobial irrigants, and antibacterial filling materials. But the complexity of the pulp canal system presents a problem for chemomechanical preparation. One of the factors determining the success of endodontic treatment is the sealing material with a potent bactericidal effect. The aim of the present study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers of different bases - in vitro. The antimicrobial activity of three root canal sealers (endomethasone, AH 26, and apexit) was evaluated against seven strains of bacteria at various time intervals using the agar diffusion test. The freshly mixed sealers were placed in prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. The plates were incubated for 24, 48, 72 hours, and 7 and 15 days. The mean zones of inhibition were measured. All statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 13 statistical software version. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), post-hoc Bonferroni test, and paired t test were performed to reveal the statistical significance. Statistically significant zones of bacterial growth inhibition were observed in descending order of antimicrobial activity: endomethasone, AH 26, and apexit. Zinc oxide eugenol based root canal sealer produced largest inhibitory zones followed in decreasing order by epoxy resin based sealer and least by calcium hydroxide based root canal sealer. ","847":null,"848":"Digital photographs play a substantial role in the presentation and validation of clinical cases for documentation and research purposes in esthetically oriented professions such as dentistry. The introduction of sophisticated cameras and \"easy to use\" computer software readily available on today's market has enabled digital fraud to emerge as a common and widely used practice. Hence, it is essential that both dentists and editorial circles are aware and cautious with regard to the possibility of digital fraud. A set of 10 routine \"pre-\" and \"post\" treatment dental procedure photographs were taken and randomly manipulated using standard desktop software. A team of 10 dental professionals were selected and each one of them was individually requested to review and evaluate the authenticity of the photographs. An assessment of expert opinion revealed an overall sensitivity of 60% and a sensitivity of 15% in correctly identifying a manipulated photograph, which is considered low. Furthermore, there was poor interobserver agreement. Advanced technology that is easily available has resulted in adept digital fraud that is difficult to detect. There is a need for awareness among both dental practitioners and the editorial circle regarding misrepresentation due to image manipulation. It is therefore necessary to follow a skeptical approach in the assessment of digitalized photos used in research and as a part of clinical dentistry. ","849":"Class II malocclusions are seen due to the underdevelopment of the mandible in most of the cases. To compensate for the mandible retrusive position, there is flaring of the lower anterior teeth or retroclination of the central incisors as a compensatory mechanism seen in Class II division 2 type of malocclusion. This case report evaluates the skeletal and dental changes when a 12-year-old female patient with Class II div 2 malocclusion was treated with a modified anterior inclined plane. The postreatment data suggested that there were no significant changes in the vertical skeletal parameters. The upper central incisors were significantly realigned by proclination along with retroclination of the lateral incisors. There was significant increase in the mandibular length. The results revealed that the modified anterior inclined plane showed good results in the treatment of a case of Class II div 2 malocclusion.","850":"A 9-year-old boy reported with swelling on right side of the face after injury by a cricket ball while fielding.

It occurs usually as a single mass with various sizes, although some multiple lesions have also been reported. The lesion is more common in female neonates and normally affects the maxillary alveolar ridge. Rare recurrence and no malignant alteration have also been reported. This condition may interfere with respiration, feeding or adequate closure of the mouth. A decisive diagnosis is made by histopathologic analysis as other newborn lesions can be incorrectly diagnosed as CE. This article presents a case report of a female infant who presented a fibrotic mass in the primary lateral incisor and canine region of the maxillary alveolar ridge. The lesion was not causing feeding or respiratory problems. After a watchful waiting procedure and no spontaneous regression, the lesion was excised under local anesthesia and confirmed by histopathologic analysis as CE.","852":"Anterior crown fractures are a common form of injury that mainly affect children and adolescents. The position of maxillary incisors and their eruptive pattern carries a significant risk for trauma. In the pre-adhesive era, fractured teeth needed to be restored either with pin-retained inlays or cast restorations that sacrificed healthy tooth structure and were a challenge for clinicians to match with adjacent teeth. The development of adhesive dentistry has allowed dentists to use the patient's own fragment to restore the fractured tooth. Three cases are presented here with complicated crown fracture of maxillary central incisors; the reattachment of the fractured tooth segment in this case has been performed using different combinations of techniques, viz. simple reattachment, circumferential bevel and internal dentinal groove.","853":"Supernumerary tooth may closely resemble the teeth of the group to which it belongs, i.e. molars, premolars or anterior teeth, or it may bear little resemblance in size or shape to which it is associated. Many complications can be associated with supernumeraries, like impaction, delayed eruption or ectopic eruption of adjacent teeth, crowding, development of median diastema and eruption into floor of the nasal cavity. This may also cause the formation of follicular cysts with significant bone destruction. Early intervention to remove it is usually required to obtain reasonable alignment and occlusal relationship. This article will present the clinical management of an (i) impacted supernumerary tooth impeding the eruption of maxillary central incisor and (ii) erupted supernumerary tooth with midline diastema.","854":"Thumb sucking is the process of sucking on the thumb for oral pleasure. Thumb and finger sucking habits, or nonnutritive sucking, are considered to be the most prevalent of oral habits. Some parents are concerned by thumb sucking and may even try to restrain the infant or child. In most cases, this is not necessary. Most children stop thumb sucking on their own. When older children continue to suck their thumbs, it could mean they are bored, anxious, or have emotional problems such as depression. This article presents a case report of a child with Hurler's syndrome along with thumb sucking\/biting habit. Hurler's syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis I, is a rare condition inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. It represents the classical prototype of mucopolysaccharide disorder. A unique appliance to prevent thumb sucking\/biting was developed and termed as \"RURS' elbow guard,\" which was successfully used to break thumb sucking of the child with Hurler syndrome. The present report also describes the steps in fabrication of this new habit-breaking appliance, which is also designed to protect the finger from the effects of the sucking habit.","855":"The unusual case of acanthomatous ameloblastoma occurring in maxillary left anterior region in a 13-year-old female child is presented with chief complaint of swelling in the upper left anterior region since one year and spacing between maxillary left central incisor and canine. Microscopic examination of surgically excised specimen revealed solid epithelial cell nests with peripheral palisading ameloblastic cells and the central squamous cell assemblage that was consistent with the findings of acanthomatous ameloblastoma type. Acanthomatous ameloblastoma is the extremely rare variant. The present report discusses issues related to the incidence of such formations in the target tissues.","856":"Dentigerous cysts are usually encountered in the practice of pediatric dentistry. The treatment modalities range from marsupialization to enucleation of the lesion and are based on the involvement of the lesion with the adjacent structures. However, loss of a permanent tooth in the management of a dentigerous cyst can be devastating to a child who has already a congenitally missing tooth. The first case describes the technique of marsupialization in which we extracted the grossly carious deciduous 1st molar and created a window through the extracted socket to decompress the lesion. In this case the 2nd premolars were congenitally missing on both sides of the mandible for which we had not gone for enucleation of the dentigerous cyst along with the developing 1st premolar. The second case is a developmental type of a big dentigerous cyst where marsupialization was followed by enucleation of the cystic lining but without removal of the affected tooth. Both the teeth erupted in the oral cavity.","857":"Pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic autoimmune mucocutaneous disease that initially manifests in the form of intraoral lesions, which spread to other mucous membranes and the skin. The etiology of pemphigus vulgaris is still unknown, although the disease has attracted considerable interest. The pemphigus group of diseases is characterized by the production of autoantibody against intercellular substances and is thus classified as autoimmune diseases. A case of oral pemphigus vulgaris is presented with special emphasis on diagnostic modalities.","858":null,"859":null,"860":"The present study was undertaken to compare and evaluate the effect of technique-sensitivity on shear bond strength (SBS) of one-step self-etch adhesive, using multiple coats and different applicator designs, to dentin in deciduous molars. Flat buccal dentinal surfaces were obtained on 60 extracted human primary molars. The specimens were divided into 3 equal groups (n = 20). Self-etch adhesive was applied on the dentinal surface of group I with cotton pellet, group II with microapplicator tip, and group III using 3M brush. The groups were further divided into 2 subgroups-single coat of dentin-bonding agent (DBA) in subgroups A and triple coat (with no curing in between coats) in subgroups B. The composite was placed on the dentinal surface using split nylon cylinder and cured. SBS was tested for all specimens with Instron Universal testing machine. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student's t test. There was no statistically significant difference in the main study groups, that is, no significant difference in the SBS with the use of different applicator tips. However, the use of triple coat of self-etch DBA exhibited highly significant difference in the SBS as compared with single coat. This study revealed that one-step self-etch adhesive could prove attractive in pediatric dentistry because of its lesser technique-sensitivity; however, increasing the number of coats of DBA (with no curing in between the layers) enhanced the bond strength to dentin owing to the improved resin infiltration. ","861":"Probiotic technology represents a breakthrough approach to maintaining oral health by utilizing natural beneficial bacteria commonly found in healthy mouths to provide a natural defense against those bacteria thought to be harmful to teeth and gums. However, data are still sparse on the probiotic action in the oral cavity. The review article on probiotics in children published by Twetman and Stecksen- Blicks in 2008 showed only one study of dental interest on probiotics in children. The present study evaluated clinically the efficacy of a probiotic and chlorhexidine mouth rinses on plaque and gingival accumulation in children. The trial design is a double-blind parallel group, 14 days comparative study between a probiotic mouth rinse and a chlorhexidine mouth rinse, which included 45 healthy children in the age group of 6-8 years. The Probiotic and Chlorhexidine groups had less plaque accumulations compared with the Control group at the end of 14 years (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). But, unlike the plaque score, there was a significant difference in the Gingival Index between the Probiotic and the Chlorhexidine groups (P = 0.009), Probiotic group being better than the Chlorhexidine group (mean = 0.2300 and 0.6805, respectively). The Probiotic mouth rinse was found effective in reducing plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation. Therefore, probiotic mouth rinse obviously has a potential therapeutic value and further long-term study is recommended to determine its efficacy.

The radiographs were traced to arrive at six linear and two angular measurements from which the relative position of the MF was assessed and compared in different age groups to determine the growth pattern of the mandible and changes in the location of the MF. The distances between the MF and the anterior plane of the ramus were greater than that between MF and posterior plane of the ramus through all stages. There was a maximum increase in the vertical dimensions of the mandible compared with the horizontal dimensions, particularly in the late mixed dentition period. The mandible and its growth did not alter the position of the MF, both vertically and horizontally, in relation to different landmarks, and more obtuse GoA indicated an increased growth potential of the mandible. This has major implications in the inferior alveolar nerve block technique when used in children. ","863":"Dentin is the fundamental substrate of restorative dentistry and its properties and characteristics are key determinants of nearly all restorative, preventive and disease processes of the teeth. The intrinsic permeability of dentin is responsible for permitting bacterial or chemical substances to diffuse across the dentin and irritate the pulpal and periradicular tissues. Improved understanding of the dentin structure and nature will have important consequences for today's dental procedures. The aims of the study were to observe the direction of dentinal tubules, interglobular dentin, incremental lines of dentin and the dead tracts. A total of 30 teeth (15 primary and 15 permanent molars), unrestored, noncarious, hypoplastic extracted molars were used. Longitudinal ground sections of teeth were obtained using hard tissue microtome. Examination of ground sections of the primary teeth dentin showed \"s\"-shaped curvature in four (26.7%) specimens and a straight course of dentinal tubules in 11 (73.3%) specimens out of 15 teeth examined whereas in permanent teeth, all 15 (100%) specimens showed an \"s\"-shaped curvature. These results are statistically highly significant (P &lt; 0.001). Dentinal tubules followed an \"s\"-shaped course in all the 15 (100%) permanent molars and in four (26.7%) primary molars. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of interglobular dentin of primary and permanent molars. But, they were at angles in the primary teeth. ","864":"Is low-concentration chlorhexidine effective against reducing the mutans streptococci (MS) in saliva? To compare the efficacy of different concentrations of chlorhexidine mouth rinses, i.e. 0.02%, 0.06% and 0.12%, in reducing the mutants streptococci count in saliva. Forty subjects in the age group of 12-14 years were selected from the schools of Chennai and were equally divided into four groups. The first three were study groups and the fourth group was the control group. The subjects were instructed to rinse with a measured amount of mouth rinse for 1 min, twice-daily, for 1 week. Salivary samples were collected at baseline and 1 week after mouth rinsing with various concentrations and were cultured on MSB agar. The number of MS colonies was counted on agar medium under anaerobic conditions. The results of the study confirmed that children using chlorhexidine of concentration 0.12% showed the maximum reduction in MS when compared with subjects using 0.02% and 0.06% concentrations. But, children using chlorhexidine of concentration 0.06% also showed significant reduction in MS when compared with the control group. From the above study, we conclude that chlorhexidine used in different concentrations (0.02%, 0.06%, 0.12%) efficiently reduced the mutans count.

Psychographic analysis of the factors that add to fear level of the children can be accessed through Children fear survey schedule-dental subscale (CFSS-DS); however, its varied applicability in different environmental situations has been tested through this paper. The aim of present study is to evaluate the reliability and factor structure of the Indian version of the CFSS-DS. The routine patients attending Outpatient Department of Pedodontics with Preventive Dentistry, Faculty of Dental Sciences, Lucknow, India (n=197, aged 7-12 years old) were evaluated for children's fear survey schedule-dental subscale which was filled by parents on behalf of the child. Reliability analysis (alpha) was performed to assess the internal consistency of the Indian translation of the scale. Factor analysis (principle components, varimax rotation) was employed to assess the factor structure. Children fear survey scale-dental subscale was found to be equally reliable (Cronbach alpha = 0.92) and applicable among Indian subjects. However, factorization revealed emergence of 1) hospital, injections and hospital personnel, 2) drilling and interaction with unknown, 3) dental care personnel and practices. The present study extended the universal applicability of children fear survey schedule -dental subscale, while at the same time it was able to highlight different facets of problem in different environments. ","867":"Preventive procedures using pit and fissure sealants are one of the most important aspects of pediatric dental practice. The objectives of this in vitro study were to comparatively evaluate microleakage of a flowable resin used as a sealant on molars after preparation with conventional, enameloplasty and fissurotomy techniques. A total of 24 teeth were divided into three groups of eight samples each. Pits and fissures were prepared with conventional sealant technique (CST) (Group A), enameloplasty sealant technique (EST) (Group B) and fissurotomy technique (FT) (Group C). Following sealant placement, thermocycling and sectioning of samples of Groups A, B and C were performed and microleakage was assessed under a stereomicroscope after methylene blue dye immersion. There was significantly lesser microleakage in EST when compared with CST and FT, which showed more microleakage. No statistical significance between CST and FT was found. EST has proven to be an excellent method of preparation of pits and fissures when flowable composite is used as a sealant because of its lesser microleakage. ","868":"The literature is replete with studies establishing Streptococcus mutans as a major player in the formation of pit and fissure caries in all dentitions. Salivary bacterial levels in turn are related to the number of colonized surfaces. Therefore, decreasing the salivary levels of S. mutans would have a great benefit in decreasing the incidence of dental diseases. Keeping in mind the potential antimicrobial effects of saturated saline and alum solutions, the present study was attempted to compare and evaluate the effects of saturated saline rinse and 0.02 M alum mouthrinse on salivary S. mutans levels in children. The investigation was a double-blind, stratified comparison of three parallel groups of children who used either saturated saline rinse, 0.02 M alum mouthrinse or distilled water (placebo) rinse twice daily under professional supervision for a 21-day period. A total of three saliva samples were taken from each individual - at baseline, on the 10 th day and on the 21 st day, and colony counts of S. mutans were determined. All data were subjected to statistical analysis using Wilcoxon's Signed Ranks Sum and Mann-Whitney \"U\" test. Children using saturated saline rinse and alum rinse showed statistically significant reductions in salivary S. mutans counts after 10 days and also after 21 days. After 21 days, the saturated saline rinse and alum rinse groups showed statistically significant differences over the placebo rinse group. Again, the alum rinse group showed a statistically significant difference over the saturated saline rinse group. ","869":"We present a case of 10 year-old boy with oropharyngeal injury caused by a toothbrush which penetrated the parapharyngeal space. Initial examination revealed broken end of the toothbrush in oral cavity with the head of the toothbrush having bristles, beyond the soft palate. Tongue and palate were lacerated and there were blood and oral secretions in the oral cavity. Patient was having bradycardia. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed the toothbrush head near the carotid artery, the carotid being laterally displaced. The foreign body was surgically removed without any intraoperative or postoperative complications.","870":"Tongue tie, also known as ankyloglossia or ankyloglossia inferior, is a relatively common finding in pediatric surgical outpatient clinics. It occurs as a result of a short, tight, lingual frenum causing tethering of the tongue tip. It is a common oral finding in infants and children, which is often neglected. Although most cases resolve or are asymptomatic, some patients develop articulation problems and other concerns related to poor tongue-tip mobility. In this article, we report on a 5-year old girl with a tongue tie, who underwent frenectomy using monopolar diathermy under local anesthesia without any postoperative complication.","871":"Fibrous dysplasia is a disturbance of bone metabolism that is classified as a benign fibro-osseous lesion. Fibrous connective tissue, containing abnormal bone, replaces normal bone. The etiology of fibrous dysplasia is unknown. The radiographic appearance of the irregularly shaped trabeculae aids in the differential diagnosis. Occurring most commonly in the second decade of life, the lesions of fibrous dysplasia can be surgically recontoured for esthetic or functional purposes once they become dormant. Here, we report a case of bilateral fibrous dysplasia in a 7 year old male patient and its diagnostic work-up.","872":"Unusual root canal morphology in multirooted teeth is a constant challenge for diagnosis and successful endodontic treatment. Presence of extra canals, lateral canals, deltas is commonly encountered but the possibility of existence of fewer number of roots and canals also exists. This clinical report presents a maxillary first molar with an unusual morphology of single root with single canal. This report also highlights the role of spiral computerized tomography as a method to confirm the three-dimensional anatomy of teeth.","873":"The paradental cyst is an uncommon lesion associated with the permanent mandibular first or second molar in children just prior to tooth eruption. The purpose of this article is to present two cases of paradental cyst affecting the buccal aspect of permanent mandibular first molar of both young patients. We also discuss diagnosis, treatment and radiographic findings of the cases. In both cases was made only the enucleation of cyst without extraction of the adjacent tooth. Lesional samples were sent for histopathologic analysis. The histopathologic analysis of both cases, revealed a lining of hyperplastic, nonkeratinized squamous epithelium with heavy, dense inflammatory cell infiltrate in the epithelium and connective tissue wall. The histopathology associated with macroscopic and radiographic examination permitted the definitive diagnosis of a paradental cyst on the mandibular left first molar. A follow-up of 1 year was carried out in both cases and no recurrences was noted; in the first case was observed the correct eruption of the mandibular permanent left first molar. A clinicopathologic correlation, incorporating the surgical, radiographic, and histological finding, is required to obtain the final diagnosis of paradental cyst. Today, the treatment of choice is simple enucleation and thorough curettage of the cyst without extraction of the involved tooth. ","874":"Early orthodontic interventions are often initiated in the developing dentition to promote favorable developmental changes. Interceptive orthodontic can eliminate or reduce the severity of a developing malocclusion, the complexity of orthodontic treatment, overall treatment time and cost. Premature loss of deciduous tooth or teeth can often destroy the integrity of normal occlusion. There are many space regaining and maintaining devices mentioned in literature. In this article, I present a simple space regaining method by a piece of nickel titanium (NiTi) wire bonded between the teeth in active loop form, and the unique shape memory property of NiTi wire will upright or move the teeth and the lost space can be regained easily.","875":"Management of trauma to an immature permanent incisor is a challenge, especially when the pulp is necrotic. The aim of this study is to discuss the management of fractured maxillary right and left central incisors with immature root apex. Radiographic evaluation revealed that the tooth 11 had convergent apical walls, whereas tooth 21 had parallel apical walls; both the incisors were treated with pure calcium hydroxide paste to induce apical development. Follow-up clinical and radiographic examinations confirmed apical barrier at 3 months. Radiograph of tooth 11 with convergent roots showed continued apical development, whereas tooth 21 showed apical bridging, following which root canal was completed in both the teeth. Therefore, in view of the simplicity of this method, we believe that calcium hydroxide can be reemphasized as one of the treatment alternatives for fractured nonvital immature permanent incisors to induce apical barrier.","876":"Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) (OMIM 119300) is a dominantly inherited developmental disorder that is characterized by pits and\/or sinuses of the lower lip and cleft lip and\/or cleft palate. Mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 gene (IRF6) have been recently identified in patients with VWS, with more than 60 mutations reported. We report the phenotypic variants of the syndrome in a family and present the application of the multicolor chromosome banding (mBAND) analysis in the identification of complex intrachromosome rearrangements of chromosome 9 in a child with VWS. The authors conclude that increased heterochromatin on chromosome 9 did not have any effect on the phenotypic expression of the syndrome in the family that was studied.","877":"Dental caries comprise the single most chronic disease affecting children today. Evidence increasingly suggests that for successful prevention of dental caries, preventive interactions must begin within the first year of life. Pediatricians are responsible for the primary care of the child and are well positioned to begin this process if they recognize and encourage good preventive habits and refer appropriately. Insufficient information about their role in prevention of dental caries led us to conduct a survey among pediatricians in Bangalore urban to determine their knowledge, attitude and practice in prevention of dental caries.","878":"The purpose of the study was to assess skeletal age using MP3 and hand-wrist radiographs and to find the correlation amongst the skeletal, dental and chronological ages. One hundred and sixty North-Indian healthy children in the age group 8-14 years, comprising equal number of males and females were included in the study. The children were radiographed for middle phalanx of third finger (MP3) and hand-wrist of the right hand and intra oral periapical X-ray for right permanent maxillary canine. Skeletal age was assessed from MP3 and hand-wrist radiographs according to the standards of Greulich and Pyle. The dental age was assessed from IOPA radiographs of right permanent maxillary canine based on Nolla's calcification stages. Skeletal age from MP3 and hand-wrist radiographs shows high correlation in all the age groups for both sexes. Females were advanced in skeletal maturation than males. Skeletal age showed high correlation with dental age in 12-14 years age group. Chronological age showed inconsistent correlation with dental and skeletal ages.","879":"In this investigation, serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) titers, as well as total immunoglobulin concentration (IgG + IgA + IgM), were found to be raised with the increase in the number of dental caries. Only the total serum antibody titer in high dental caries (HDC) group was found to be significantly raised as compared to no dental carries (NDC) group. Although the IgG and IgA titers were raised in blood with the increased number of caries, the results were not statistically significant. However, we could not find any correlation between serum antibodies and dental caries except that there was an increased trend of serum antibodies to GTF with the increased number of carious lesions.","880":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the extent of surface zone remineralization and the effect of fluoride at the inter-proximal adjacent tooth surface, using restorative materials FusionAlloy, Ketac-Fil and Heliomolar. Ninety extracted molar teeth were used of which 45 were placed in artificial caries for 10 weeks. The remaining 45 teeth were filled with the respective restorative materials, mounted with the artificial carious teeth in proximal contact with plaster and placed in artificial saliva for a period of 28 days. Finally, sectioning of artificially carious teeth was done mesio-distally and observed under the optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. Comparison among the groups was done by one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] and Fischer's F test. Intercomparison between the groups was done by using Dunnett's t-test. Results obtained from transmitted electron microscopic and scanning electron microscopic observations were almost similar with the Ketac-Fil and Heliomolar showing better results in surface zone remineralization compared to FusionAlloy. Also, Ketac-Fil is a good material in releasing fluoride to remineralize enamel when compared to Heliomolar and FusionAlloy. Thus, it can be used mainly in class II cavity restorations of primary and permanent dentitions due to the potential ability of fluoride containing glass ionomer cements and composite resins to remineralize incipient carious lesions on adjacent teeth.","881":"The role of caretakers at day-care centers has become more imperative in promoting oral health care in children since many new mothers opt to work outside their homes, leaving their children at day-care centers. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of oral health promoting factors among secondary caretakers of children attending day-care centers. This was a cross-sectional exploratory study conducted among secondary caretakers in Kubang Kerian, Malaysia. Thirty-four caretakers fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria participated in the study. The data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire addressing various aspects of knowledge, attitude and practice of oral health in children. Analysis was done using SPSS version 12.0. The knowledge of factors causing dental caries was found to be good among majority of the caretakers, but the concepts of transmissibility of caries and effect of hidden sugars were not evident. Seventy one percent did not know that frequent bottle feeding could cause tooth decay. Attitudes seemed to be governed by the cultural practices of the region rather than the knowledge obtained. The knowledge was not translated to practice adequately. Giving sweetened liquid in bottles was practiced by 53% of the caretakers. Implementation of nursery-based oral health promotion programs for secondary caretakers is needed to counteract early childhood caries. ","882":"Painless dentistry, minimal intervention and thus giving comfort, relief and solace and instill positive attitude toward dental treatments, are some of the factors justifying the specialty of pediatric dentistry. Thus, this in vitro study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of a new chemomechanical caries removal agent, Papacarie (Formula and Acao), with conventional slow-speed rotary instrument (bur). Papacarie is a new formulation and has the main active ingredient papain, an endoprotein with bactericidal, bacteriostatic and anti-inflammatory actions. Twenty extracted human molar teeth with deep dentine caries and no enamel coverage were selected for the study. After the preparation of the teeth and removal of the caries with the respective methods, they were decalcified, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin blocks for histologic studies. Serial sections of 5 mum thickness were examined for the presence of bacteria under light microscope. Though complete removal of caries was achieved significantly in both the methods, there was less marked destruction of dentinal tubules in chemomechanical caries removal method by Papacarie. Thus, Papacarie is recommended as an efficient, easy to perform, comfortable and less destructive solution for the patient seeking an alternative to the conventional method.","883":"This study was designed to compare 2% sodium fluoride (NaF) iontophoresis with other cavity liners. This study was carried out in 30 patients in the age group 10-14 years with bilateral carious permanent first molars. The study evaluated the use of 2% NaF iontophoresis as a cavity liner and also compared its desensitizing effect with varnish and an adhesive bonded liner. Sensitivity gradings were done on a subjective verbal rating scale. All the liner treatments decreased the sensitivity following liner application. However, decrease of sensitivity in the case of 2% NaF iontophoresis was more compared with that of varnish and adhesive bonded liner. The results were statistically significant. It was found that 2% NaF iontophoresis was more effective in reducing the postoperative sensitivity compared with that of varnish and scotchbond multipurpose. ","884":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the morphological characteristics of deciduous teeth of children in Chennai and Hyderabad, by establishing normal data on the mesiodistal and buccolingual crown dimensions in 3-5 year old children. Study casts of 200 children (100 boys and 100 girls) from two groups (Chennai and Hyderabad) were used in this study. Digital caliper was used to measure the mesiodistal and buccolingual dimensions. Significant differences were found in the mean values of mesiodistal and buccolingual diameters of primary teeth, in which boys generally had larger crown diameters than girls. ","885":"Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a rare group of disorders affecting the hair, teeth, nails and sweat glands to a variable degree. There is a wide range of clinical presentation of HED. Missing teeth or abnormal tooth form may be the first indicator of the disorder. We present a case report of 5 cases of HED with their intraoral findings and their treatment plan. We also consider the various etiological factors and their clinical diagnostic aids.","886":"A 6-year-old boy was brought to the dental department with a history of toothache in the anterior maxillary region. Intraoral examination revealed caries in the deciduous upper central and lateral incisor teeth. Radiological evaluation revealed the silhouette of a metallic paper clip in the pulp chamber of the deciduous right maxillary central incisor. The tooth was extracted as the permanent incisor was erupting below. Children often avoid informing their parents regarding such incidents due to fear of punishment.","887":"Dental caries is the single most common chronic childhood disease. In rampant caries, there is early pulp involvement and gross destruction of the maxillary anterior teeth as well as posterior teeth. This leads to decreased masticatory efficiency, difficulty in speech, compromised esthetics, development of abnormal tongue habits and subsequent malocclusion and psychological problems. The restoration of severely decayed primary incisors is often a procedure that presents a special challenge to dentists, particularly in an uncooperative child. This case report documents the restoration of severely mutilated deciduous teeth in an emotionally immature patient under general anesthesia.","888":"Maxillary canine-lateral incisor transposition is a relatively rare anomaly, with both dental and facial esthetic implications. This is a case report of a maxillary canine-lateral incisor transposition that was successfully treated by surgical-orthodontic treatment followed by esthetic reshaping of the involved teeth.","889":"Trauma to primary teeth can result in a wide range of disturbances to the underlying permanent teeth, such as dilaceration. Root dilacerations occur more commonly than crown dilacerations. This paper is a report of an 11-year-old girl with a missing maxillary left anterior tooth. Past history revealed premature loss of primary maxillary anterior teeth due to trauma. Radiographic examination revealed crown dilaceration of permanent maxillary left central incisor. An interdisciplinary approach in the management of this child is presented herewith.","890":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate cephalometrically the treatment effects of preorthodontic trainer on dentoskeletal components in individuals showing class II division I malocclusion. This study comprised of 50 class II div. I patients (20 test patients and 30 controls) in the age group of 8-12 years. The test group was treated with a preorthodontic trainer for a period of 15 months. Standardized lateral cephalograms of both groups were taken before and after the treatment period. The cephalograms were then evaluated to determine the skeletal and dental changes in the course of treatment and then compared with the normative growth data to eliminate the possible growth effects. The readings were tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis. The results of the study after excluding the changes due to growth showed reduction in ANB and OP-SN values, indicating a significant reduction in the skeletal class II relationship. An upward cant of the occlusal plane in the treatment group was noted, probably due to the forward rotation of mandible. A significant increase in the vertical dimensions of the face in general and the mandible in particular was observed with the use of preorthodontic trainer. A significant reduction in the overjet and an increase in the inclination of mandibular incisor (L1-NB deg) were noted in the treatment group when compared with control group. It can be concluded that class II corrections can be achieved with the preorthodontic trainer appliance, which appears to have mostly dentoalveolar effects with smaller but significant skeletal effects.","891":"Various root canal filling materials are used to preserve a pulpally involved carious primary tooth. But there is no single material so far available to fulfill all the requirements of an ideal root canal filling material for a primary tooth. Hence this study was undertaken to evaluate clinically and radiographically the efficacy of three obturating materials - Calcium hydroxide with Iodoform (METAPEX), Zinc Oxide Eugenol with Iodoform (RC FILL) and Zinc Oxide Eugenol and Calcium hydroxide with Iodoform (ENDOFLAS) for a period of 9 months. Results show ENDOFLAS gave an overall success rate of 95.1%, METAPEX - 90.5% and RC FILL - 84.7%. In our study, we conclude that ENDOFLAS, a mixture of Zinc Oxide Eugenol and Calcium hydroxide with Iodoform fulfills most of the required properties of an ideal root canal filling for primary teeth.","892":"Antibacterial efficacy of formocresol, 2% gluteraldehyde and iodine-potassium iodide was assessed by obtaining cultures at consecutive appointments in multiple visit pulpectomies in primary molars. Formocresol and 2% gluteraldehyde were more effective as intracanal medicaments and caused significant reduction in the counts of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, thereby supporting the need for placing intracanal medicaments with antibacterial properties, in multiple visit pulpectomies in primary molars.","893":"A variety of indices have been developed to assist professionals in categorizing malocclusion according to treatment needs. Dental aesthetic index (DAI) is one such index. DAI quantifies the normal variations usually seen and the dentofacial anomalies. A retrospective study on hundred available and treated cases was carried out on the casts. This survey was mainly carried out to determine the role of pedodontist in early identification of dental anomalies using DAI and sound referral of the patient to the orthodontist for better comprehensive care during the growth period in children. The materials used to collect data included periodontal probe with millimeter markings, ruler, calipers, pencil, and eraser. The results showed that when grouped according to various malocclusion severity levels by DAI, 3% had no or minor malocclusion indicating no or slight need of treatment, 15% had definite malocclusion and the treatment needed was elective, 27% had severe malocclusion and treatment was highly desirable, and remaining 55% of the casts had very severe or handicapping malocclusion and the treatment was mandatory. This study shows that DAI can be effectively used to evaluate and recognize the orthodontic needs of Indian children with permanent dentition and treated at an early stage so that the treatment is more effective.","894":"Band materials are often used in the practice of pediatric dentistry. Nickel and Chromium are the main ingredients of these materials. The potential health hazards of nickel and chromium and their compounds have been the focus of attention for more than 100 years. It has established that these metals could cause hypersensitivity. The study was undertaken to analyze in vitro biodegradation of space maintainers made out of stainless steel band materials from manufacturers Dentaurum and Unitek. The leaching effect simulating the use of one, two, three, and four space maintainers in clinical practice was studied by keeping the respective number of space maintainers in the artificial saliva incubating at 37 degrees C and analyzing for nickel and chromium release after 1,7,14,21 and 28 days using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results showed that there was measurable release of both nickel and chromium which reached maximum level at the end of 7 days which was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) and was very much below the dietary average intake even for four bands used and was not capable of causing any toxicity.","895":"Sterilization is the best method to counter the threats of microorganisms. The purpose of sterilization in the field of health care is to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. In dentistry, it primarily relates to processing reusable instruments to prevent cross-infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of 4 methods of sterilizing endodontic instruments: Autoclaving, carbon dioxide laser sterilization, chemical sterilization (with glutaraldehyde) and glass-bead sterilization. The endodontic file was sterilized by 4 different methods after contaminating it with bacillus stearothermophillus and then checked for sterility by incubating after putting it in test tubes containing thioglycollate medium. The study showed that the files sterilized by autoclave and lasers were completely sterile. Those sterilized by glass bead were 90% sterile and those with glutaraldehyde were 80% sterile. The study concluded that autoclave or laser could be used as a method of sterilization in clinical practice and in advanced clinics; laser can be used also as a chair side method of sterilization.","896":"","897":"Digit sucking, a form of non-nutritive sucking, is a habit of concern to specialist in various fields such as psychiatrist, psychologist, pediatricians, pediatric dentists, orthodontist, speech pathologist and plastic surgeon. The habits have harmful unbalanced pressures to be born by the immature highly malleable alveolar ridges. Sucking behaviors have long been recognized to affect occlusion and dental arch characteristics. As early as 1870s, Campbell and Chandler recognized that prolonged finger or thumb sucking habits had deleterious effects on certain occlusal traits including anterior open bite, increased over jet and class II canine and molar relationships. However, little is known about digit sucking habit and its effect in a cleft lip and palate child as there is no literature till now reported on the digit sucking in a cleft lip patient.","898":"Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC) is a chondro-ectodermal dysplasia characterized by short ribs, polydactyly, growth retardation and ectodermal and heart defects. It is a rare disease complex and very few cases have been reported in dental literature. This condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with variable expression. The present case report describes EVC in a 7-year-old girl, with all the tetrad of cardinal features. We found a rare dental aberration in form; appearance of single conical roots in primary molars. The management of children with EVC is multidisciplinary, with consideration for the high incidence of cardiac defects in these patients.","899":"Bruxism is the non-functional clenching or grinding of the teeth that may occur during sleep or, less commonly in the daytime in 5-20% of adults and about 30% of 56 year old children. Although research on bruxism is extensive, its etiology remains debatable. There is some literature to suggest that bruxism is correlated with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and malocclusion. The aim of this article is to present the course of this condition in a case of bruxism coupled with TMD with special emphasis on the importance of accurate diagnosis of maxillofacial pain. We also report an association between supernumerary teeth and TMDs that has not been reported earlier in the literature.","900":"A 10-year-old girl presented with a chief complaint of many unerupted teeth. Complete clinical and radiological examination of this patient confirmed the diagnosis of cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). Her father also presented similar features with a lesser clinical severity. CCD is an autosomal-dominant heritable skeletal disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor RUNX2 gene. Failure of tooth eruption is probably mainly due to this mutated gene in CCD patients. Interdisciplinary treatment approach is obligatory for rehabilitation of these patients. In confirmed cases, genetic counseling for family planning should certainly be advised.","901":"The purpose of this study was to assess, by means of a self administered structured questionnaire, the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of physical education teachers in Bangalore city with regards to emergency management of dental injuries. The questionnaire surveyed the physical education teacher's background, knowledge of management of tooth fracture, avulsion, luxation injuries, it also investigated physical education teacher's attitude and the way they handle the injuries. The sample consisted 580 teachers from 700 selected schools in Bangalore city. Chi-square test was applied to test the significance between trained and untrained teachers. Among the population 70% were males physical education teachers 30% were females. 95% of the teachers had physical education training and 5% did not have the training. 95% of the population had first aid component and 5% did not have. Only 25% of trained physical education teachers had correct knowledge about tooth identification and 17% among untrained teachers. 81% of trained teachers answered correctly regarding management of fractured anterior teeth against 27.5% of untrained teachers (P&lt; 0.0002). The present report indicates that there is lack of knowledge and practice among physical education teachers in Bangalore city regarding emergency management of dental trauma. Educational programs to improve the knowledge and awareness among the teachers have to be implemented.","902":"Nucleolar organizer Regions (NORs) are situated within the nucleolus of a cell. The proteins are selectively stained by the silver colloid technique that is known as the AgNOR technique. AgNOR stain can be visualized as a black dot under the optical microscope. The present study aimed to evaluate the cases for quantitative estimation of AgNORs in the epithelial cells in various grades of gingival overgrowth to that of normal gingival tissues. Only preadolescent and adolescent groups aged up to 14 years were selected. Twenty normal and 31 disease cases of gingival overgrowth were selected. The tissue sections were stained by the hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) technique for the routine histological evaluation, while the AgNOR counts were performed through the improved one-step method of Ploton et al. HandE staining revealed five different types of gingival overgrowth. The plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and AgNOR count were not significantly (P&gt; 0.05) higher than that of control cases in pyogenic granuloma, puberty gingivitis, and in drug-induced gingival overgrowth cases. In gingival fibromatosis cases, for comparison of different indices t-tests were done. The PI when compared with AgNOR count was found significant at 5% level and 0.1% level for mixed and permanent dentition, respectively. The GI when compared with AgNOR count was found significant at 1% level and 0.1% level in mixed and permanent dentitions, respectively. ","903":"This study was conducted to compare the in vivo effectiveness of DIAGNOdent with other conventional methods (visual, tactile and bitewing radiographs) for the detection of occlusal caries in primary molars. Another objective of the study was to calculate new cut-off limits for the detection of caries by DIAGNOdent in primary teeth. Eighty-four primary molars in 52 children (aged 8-12 years), which were indicated for extraction, were selected and evaluated for dental caries using DIAGNOdent, visual and tactile examination and bitewing radiographs. Histological examination of the sections, prepared subsequent to extraction of the teeth, served as the gold standard for comparison of the above-mentioned methods. When considering enamel caries, values obtained for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 48.15, 100 and 49.40% for visual examination, 48.15, 100.00 and 49.40% for tactile examination, 49.38, 50.00 and 49.40% for bitewing radiographs, 85.19, 50.00 and 84.34% for DIAGNOdent scores interpreted according to manufacturer's cut-off limits and 81.48, 100.00 and 81.93% for DIAGNOdent scores interpreted according to newly formulated cut-off limits, respectively. At dentin caries cut-off levels, the values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for visual examination were 52.78, 89.36 and 73.49%; 50.00, 91.49 and 73.49% for tactile examination; 30.56, 82.98 and 60.24% for bitewing radiographs; 72.22, 76.60 and 74.70% for DIAGNOdent scores when interpreted according to manufacturer's cut-off limits and 77.48, 74.47 and 75.90%, respectively, for the DIAGNOdent scores when interpreted according to the newly formulated cut-off limits. DIAGNOdent showed higher sensitivity and accuracy as compared with other conventional methods for detection of enamel caries, whereas for detection of dentinal caries, even though the sensitivity was high, accuracy of the DIAGNOdent device was similar to other conventional caries diagnostic methods. ","904":"Dental caries is a rapidly emerging oral health problem amongst the children of India. Its incidence in different states varies between 31 and 89%. This study was undertaken with a twin objective of assessing the prevalence of dental caries in parts of Uttaranchal state and designing the interventional strategies with a view to attend the oral health care needs of children. A total of 722 school children in the age range of 7-12 years of Nainital district were examined using WHO (1997) criteria. An overall caries prevalence of 77.7% was recorded, which is 67.26% in the age group of 7-9 years and 80.86% in 10-12 years with DMFT+deft of 1.97 and 2.61, respectively. It was observed that there were greater treatment needs in older age group. Another significant finding of the study was that the 59.96% required restorative treatment out of the various dental treatment needs evaluated.","905":"Space maintainers make good oral hygiene difficult, modify the oral environment, and increase the chances of enamel demineralization. Demineralization can be prevented or reduced by improving patient oral hygiene or by using topical fluorides. However these methods depend on patient compliance and, therefore, are not very reliable. Thus, caries prevention in banding might be enhanced by using fluoride-releasing cements. The aim of the study was to comparatively evaluate the carioprotective potential of various luting media used for band cementation in permanent as well as deciduous molars. In this study, 100 molars were taken, which were banded and stored in artificial saliva for 1 month after which the teeth were debanded. An area of 2 x 2 mm was spared and the teeth were coated with nail varnish. The coated teeth were dipped in artificial caries solution in one month followed by 1-day immersion in methylene blue dye, after which the samples were sectioned through the window. The depth of dye penetration was measured and the results were statistically analyzed. Minimum dye penetration was observed with glass ionomer, which could be due to the fluoride release from the cement, whereas the control group showed the maximum, probably due to direct contact with the artificial caries solution.","906":"Malocclusion has large impact on individual and society in term of discomfort, Quality of Life [QoL]. To assess prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment needs among middle and high school children of Davangere city, India by using Dental Aesthetic Index [DAI]. A Descriptive cross sectional study was conducted among 1000, in the age group 12 to 15 year old school children studying in middle and high schools of Davangere city, India. 10 schools were selected by simple random sampling procedure and 100 study subjects were selected proportionately for males and females by using systematic random sampling procedures in each school. Data recorded using proforma consisted DAI components. The collected data was subjected to statistical analysis. The Chi-square test [x(2)] was used for comparison of severity of malocclusion. Analysis of Variance [ANOVA] test was used for comparison of mean DAI scores between the age groups and in DAI scores. 'Z' test was used for comparing the mean DAI scores between sex group. Of the 1000 children examined, 518[ 51.8%] were males and 482[ 48.2%] were females. 80.1% school children had &lt; or = 25 DAI scores with no or minor malocclusion requiring no or little treatment, 15.7% had 26-30 DAI scores with definite malocclusion requiring elective treatment, 3.7% had 31-35 DAI scores with severe malocclusion requiring highly desirable treatment and 0.5% had &gt; or = 36 DAI scores with handicapping malocclusion requiring mandatory treatment. 80.1% school children had no or minor malocclusion which required no or slight treatment, 19.9% had definite\/handicapping malocclusion requiring definite\/mandatory orthodontic treatment. ","907":"Investigations have suggested that poor compliance could be an indicator of poor relationship with family and could be related to the person's personality traits. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of parents attitude, the anxiety during treatment and self-confidence\/self-care of the patient on cooperation during orthodontic treatment. The study material consisted of questionnaires completed by 82 adolescent patients and their parents. The patients were divided into two groups of 42 compliant and 40 non-compliant patients. The above-mentioned questionnaires were State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-STAI, Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale and The Exercise of Self-Care Agency for the patients and Mc Master Family Assessment Device and Parental Attitude Research Instrument-PARI for the parents. The problem solving and caring attitude of the father and his determinative role in the family had a positive influence on the compliance of the child. The patients who showed better compliance also had a lower state of anxiety, which could also be explained by the positive effect of the attitude of the father in the family. It would be useful to overcome the increased state of anxiety of the child in the orthodontic clinic by using educational and relaxation techniques. Besides, it would be wise to ask the father to be present at the first appointment during part of the education of the child.

Detailed case history, clinical and radiographic examinations are necessary to come to a conclusion about the nature, size, location of the foreign body and the difficulty involved in its retrieval. It is more common to find this situation in children as it is a well-known fact that children often tend to have the habit of placing foreign objects in the mouth. Sometimes the foreign objects get stuck in the root canals of the teeth, which the children do not reveal to their parents due to fear. These foreign objects may act as a potential source of infection and may later lead to a painful condition. This paper discusses the types of foreign objects found in and around the teeth and reports two cases along with their retrieval and associated management of the involved teeth.","913":"Regional odontodysplasia (RO) is a rare disorder of dental development. The affected teeth are clinically hypoplastic and hypocalcified, presenting a ghost-like appearance radiographically. The aim of this work was to report a clinical case of a child with both primary and permanent dentition affected by RO. The conducted therapy was based on a conservative approach, which consisted of follow-up clinical evaluations of the anomalous teeth. However, the endodontic treatment of the primary incisors failed. Then, the chosen option for patient rehabilitation became extraction followed by removable of prosthesis confection. The extracted teeth were processed for histological analysis. In spite of the uncertain prognosis, but taking into account the psychological aspects of the patient, a conservative approach in an attempt to maintain those viable teeth in the oral cavity should be established.","914":"Juvenile aggressive ossifying fibroma is an uncommon and controversial, benign but aggressive osteogenic neoplasm of the jaws commonly occurring in children and young adults. Complete removal of the tumor at the earliest possible stage is recommended owing to its high recurrence rate of 30-58%.

The mean def index was 1.82, 1.57 and 2.21, respectively. Interview of caregivers of children revealed that out of 105 only 12 (11.4%) children had previously been to a general dentist. None of them knew about Pedodontics as a specialty. The results of the present study can be used mainly for screening child populations in need of treatment, helping public workers and planners to develop dental health programs to aid early intervention and prevention.","916":"An accurate diagnosis of occlusal surface of permanent posterior teeth for the presence of caries is a challenge to the clinician, when using traditional explorer. This dilemma of hidden caries has led to invasively opening of the fissure before sealant placement. Enameloplasty is one such invasive procedure that has been implicated in the successful application of pit and fissure sealants. The present study aims at evaluating the fissure micromorphology and sealant penetration under scanning electron microscope both with conventional sealant technique and enameloplasty sealant technique. The study comprised of extracted human posterior teeth subjected to enameloplasty of the fissures in the study groups as compared to unprepared fissures in the control groups. The enameloplasty was performed with the help of specially designed Fissurotomy bur. The sealant used was Clinpro from 3M. All the samples were prepared for examination under scanning electron microscope. A student 't' test was performed to compare the study and the control groups. (i) The surface area available for sealant placement on the occlusal surface was significantly increased following enameloplasty. (ii) Fissure width following enameloplasty was significantly increased. (iii) Extent of sealant penetration was significantly greater with enameloplasty sealant technique as compared to conventional sealant. Enameloplasty sealant technique can be preferred to conventional sealant technique for improving adhesion, adaptation and penetration of the sealant within the fissure system.

The specimens were observed under scanning electron microscope. Out of 60, 34 teeth showed accessory canals with 97 patent canals. It was observed that maxillary molars showed a greater number of accessory canals when compared to mandibular molars, but mandibular molars showed a greater dimension in the size of the accessory canals. Round and oval accessory canals were seen, with round being more predominant.","931":"Tobacco use is one of the leading preventable causes of illness and death. The most powerful predictor of adult smoking is smoking during adolescence. While general and pediatric dentists have a positive attitude regarding tobacco cessation counseling, the same is not extrapolated into practice. Several barriers to counseling in the dental clinic have been identified and research into some of these has been conducted. Evidence-based cessation programs are still in the nascent stage, but this should not hinder dental professionals from rendering these services to the child and adolescent populations. Brief interventions, self-help materials, and nicotine replacement therapy for established nicotine dependence form the mainstay of therapy. The purpose of this paper is to identify the several barriers encountered in providing cessation and discuss the current status of its implementation in the dental clinic.","932":"","933":"Ameloblastomas have been categorized broadly into three biologic variants: cystic (unicystic), solid, and peripheral. The term plexiform unicystic ameloblastoma refers to a pattern of epithelial proliferation that has been described in cystic lesions of the jaws. Although the histology suggests that cystic ameloblastomas follow a biologically low-grade course, recent evidence suggests that they may often behave clinically as biologically aggressive tumors. This is supported by the high incidence of cortical perforation, tooth resorption, lesion size, bony destruction, and a high rate of recurrence after simple enucleation. This article tries to provide an insight for pediatric dentists regarding this biologically distinct entity. A literature review on the topic has been added along with a case report highlighting the state-of-the-art approach and management of such ameloblastomas, in pediatric patients.","934":"This paper describes the successful alignment of a horizontally impacted maxillary central incisor positioned high in the vestibule, in a 15-year-old girl, by purely orthodontic means.

The article is a step forward in establishing the predictability of orthodontic alignment in management of such cases, which may become the method of choice over extractions or surgical repositionings.","935":"Central tumors of neurogenic origin are among the most rare primary jaw tumors in children. Intraosseous neurofibromas of the jaws occur more often as solitary lesions rather than as part of a generalized neurofibromatosis. We are presenting a case of solitary intraosseous neurofibroma of the maxilla in a five-month-old infant, which is probably the youngest such case published in literature so far.","936":"Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) is a blood disorder characterized by an abnormal decrease in the number of platelets in the blood. Acute thrombocytopenic purpura is most commonly seen in young children, with a sudden onset, following a viral illness, vaccination or an insect bite. The report is a rare case of ITP, which was triggered by a honey-bee bite and caused continuous intermittent bleeding from the gingival sulcular region of the maxillary left permanent first molar, and ecchymotic spots on the forehead, scalp, and lower limbs. A complete hemogram revealed severe thrombocytopenia with platelet count as low as 15,000\/mm3. The patient was immediately hospitalized and administered platelet replacement and medication. With this report, the authors, as dentists, emphasize the significance of recognition, early diagnosis, and referral of such patients with bleeding disorders to specialized centers, for prompt treatment.","937":"Dentigerous cysts are the most common bony lesions of the jaws in children. It is one of the most prevalent types of odontogenic cysts associated with an erupted or developing tooth, particularly the mandibular third molars; the other teeth that are commonly affected are, in order of frequency, the maxillary canines, the maxillary third molars, and rarely the central incisors. Radiographically, the cyst appears as ovoid well-demarcated unilocular radiolucency with a sclerotic border. Careful evaluation of the history and the clinical and radiographical findings help clinicians to currently diagnose the condition, identify the etiological factors, and administer the appropriate treatment.","938":"The peripheral ossifying fibroma (POF) is a reactive gingival overgrowth occurring frequently in the anterior maxilla in teenagers and young adults. The pediatric patient with a POF has special management considerations compared to the adult, as it requires early recognition and treatment by the dentist. It requires proper treatment protocol with close postoperative follow-up. The present report describes a case of POF in a girl, which was surgically excised from the palatal mucosa in the maxillary incisor area. Some features of the differential diagnosis and therapy when it occurs are discussed.","939":"Many parents are often unaware of the hidden, added sugars in many foods and drinks including pediatric liquid medicines; thus, hidden sugar in the form of pediatric medications has not been focused upon as cariogenic agents. (i) assess concentration of sucrose in six pediatric drugs, (ii) determine endogenous pH of these drugs, and (iii) estimate drop in the plaque pH in the oral cavity in first 30 minutes after consumption of the drugs. Ten adult volunteers with mean age of 22 years were double blinded for the study. Concentration of sucrose was assessed by volumetric method at Department of Chemical Branch of Engineering. Endogenous pH and drop in the plaque pH after consumption of the drugs were assessed using digital pH meter. SPSS software was used to assess the pH level at different time intervals and expressed as mean +\/- SD. Changes in pH were assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Wilcoxons signed rank test. P-value was set at 0.05. There were varying amounts of fermentable sucrose detected in the drugs; all the drugs were acidic. There is a significant drop of plaque pH after consumption of the drug. These sweeteners along with their low endogenic pH form a high cariogenic formulation. Thus, nonsucrose (noncariogenic) or sugar-free medications are needed to be prescribed along with proper oral hygiene care to the children under medication. ","940":"Provision of infant oral health (IOH) care is a challenging issue in the rural areas of our country due to lack of pedodontists and other dental workforces. To overcome these barriers it is essential to call the medical and other healthcare professionals to provide IOH care in joint collaboration with dental professionals. However, it is unclear to what extent these medical professionals are really aware of preventive strategies and to what extent they impart them. Thus, the present study was designed to begin from the grass-root levels, that is, assessing the baseline knowledge and awareness regarding IOH care among students (dental\/medical) and parents (urban\/rural). Variation of opinions with inconsistencies were obtained from both medical and\/dental students and as well as from both the parental groups. This study calls for further research to evaluate the role of various factors involved in IOH care and to effectively educate all healthcare providers in this area.","941":"The present study was undertaken to compare and evaluate shear bond strength of two self-etching adhesives (sixth and seventh generation) on dentin of primary and permanent teeth. Flat dentin surface of 64 human anterior teeth (32 primary and 32 permanent) divided into four groups of 16 each. Groups A and C were treated with Contax (sixth generation), while groups B and D were treated with Clearfil S3 (seventh generation). A teflon mold was used to build the composite (Filtek Z-350) cylinders on the dentinal surface of all the specimens. Shear bond strength was tested for all the specimens with an Instron Universal Testing Machine. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA for multiple group comparison, followed by student's unpaired 't' test for group-wise comparison. There was no statistically significant difference in shear bond strength among the study groups except that primary teeth bonded with Contax exhibited significantly lesser shear bond strength than permanent teeth bonded with Clearfil S3. This study revealed that Clearfil S3 could be of greater advantage in pediatric dentistry than Contax because of its fewer steps and better shear bond strength in dentin of both primary and permanent teeth. ","942":"To determine the fluoride release from Giomer and Compomer, using different topical fluoride regimes, and to compare the amount of fluoride release from giomer with that of compomer. Forty-eight specimens of each giomer and compomer were divided into four treatment groups, namely, control group, fluoridated dentifrice (500 ppm) once daily group, fluoridated dentifrice (500 ppm) twice daily group, fluoridated dentifrice (500 ppm) once daily + fluoridated mouthwash (225 ppm) group. Each specimen was suspended in demineralizing solution for six hours and remineralizing solution for 18 hours. Fluoride release was measured in both the demineralizing solution and remineralizing solution daily for seven days. Total daily fluoride release for each specimen was calculated by adding the amount released in the demineralizing solution to that released in remineralizing solution. The fluoride release (ppm) was found to be more in Giomer when compared to Compomer. The fluoride released from Giomer and Compomer was significantly greater in the acidic demineralizing solution than in the neutral remineralizing solution. It was found that increasing fluoride exposure significantly increased fluoride release from the giomer and compomer. It was found that the fluoride release from the subgroups of giomer and compomer was in the following order: fluoridated dentifrice twice daily &gt; fluoridated dentifrice once daily + fluoridated mouthwash &gt; fluoridated dentifrice once daily &gt; control group. It was found that the giomer showed a greater fluoride uptake than the compomer. ","943":"Anxiety and fear remain the primary emotion of a child entering a dental office. Successful pediatric dentistry depends not only on the dentist's technical skills, but also on his ability to acquire and maintain a child's cooperation. A retrospective study was done using the case records of 247 children, to evaluate their behavior patterns, based on the Wright's modification of Frankl's behavior rating scale. Various behavior management techniques like the tell-show-do, reinforcements, voice control, and hand over mouth exercise used in the postgraduate section of the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Meenakshi Ammal Dental College, Chennai, India, were also evaluated in this study. Behavior of the children improved on the subsequent visits. Tell-show-do was the most common behavior management technique used and more aversive management techniques were rarely used in managing children in the dental office. Proper assessment of children's behavior helps the dentist to plan appointments and render effective and efficient dental treatment. Appropriate use of management techniques can improve the child's behavior in subsequent dental visits. ","944":"Dental caries is defined as an infectious disease of microbial origin which is related to every specialty of dentistry in one or the other way.

","947":"Oral cancer is the most common malignancy in India, where it is epidemiologically linked to the chewing of betel quid and other carcinogens. But various point mutations were detectable in the p53 and p15 genes. Hence, this review was conducted with the aim to find out genetic risks as well as markers for oral cancers and wound healing. Tobacco-related cancers are associated with polymorphisms of the CYP1A1 and GSTM1 genes in terms of genotype frequencies and cigarette smoking dose. Expression of E6\/E7 were also found in tumors, most of which were derived from the oropharynx. Presence of homozygous arginine at codon 72 renders p53 about seven times more susceptible to E6-mediated proteolytic degradation. Erythropoietin, vascular permeability factor (VPF, also known as vascular endothelial growth factor or VEGF), and PDGF has been implicated as one of the principal mitogens involved in cutaneous wound healing. Activation of NF-kB is associated with enhanced cell survival. Human papilloma virus status is a significantly favorable prognostic factor in tonsilar cancer and may be used as a marker in order to optimize the treatment of patients with this type of cancer.","948":"Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes generalized sclerosis of bone due to a defect in bone resorption and remodeling. Dental abnormality may be attributed to pathological changes in bone remodeling. Osteomyelitis is well documented as a complication of osteopetrosis.

Sixty cases of GS have been reported in the literature, but we could find no description of its oro-dental symptoms. Reye's syndrome (RS) is characterized by acute noninflammatory encephalopathy and renal and hepatic failure, while atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disorder with an immunologic basis. The aim of this paper is to describe the oro-dental and physical findings in a girl who had been diagnosed with GS at 3.5 years of age; she also had AD as well as a history of RS at infancy. We discuss the possible relationship between the three syndromes.","951":"The present study was conducted to evaluate the influence of thumb sucking and its duration on the type of malocclusion. A total of 410 North Indian individuals between ages 12-30 years, 161 males and 249 females were examined. A specially designed proforma was used to record the detailed history of the individual. Among the etiological factors it was found that history of thumb sucking was present in 13.9% and significantly related to Class II div 1 malocclusion. When thumb sucking exceeded 18 months, it was found statistically significant (P &lt; 0.1) in Class II skeletal malocclusion, in open bite (P &lt; 0.1) and in extreme overjet (P &lt; 0.5). If thumb sucking is not treated early, it can cause skeletal Class II malocclusion, anterior open bite and excessive overjet. ","952":"The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of alternative pulpotomy agents such as glutaraldehyde and ferric sulfate on the shear bond strength of self-etch adhesive systems to dentin of primary teeth. Eighty human primary molar teeth were sectioned in a mesiodistal direction and divided into experimental and control groups. Lingual dentin specimens in experimental groups were treated with glutaraldehyde and ferric sulfate. Buccal surfaces soaked in water served as control group. Each group was then divided into two groups based on the adhesive system used: Clearfil SE Bond and Adper Prompt L-Pop. A teflon mold was used to build the composite (Filtek Z-250) cylinders on the dentinal surface of all the specimens. Shear bond strength was tested for all the specimens with an Instron Universal Testing Machine. The failure mode analysis was performed with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The results revealed that glutaraldehyde and ferric sulfate significantly reduced the shear bond strength of the tested adhesive systems to primary dentin. Clearfil SE Bond showed much higher shear bond strength than Adper Prompt L Pop to primary dentin. SEM analysis revealed a predominant cohesive failure mode for both adhesive systems. This study revealed that the pulpotomy medicaments glutaraldehyde and ferric sulfate adversely affected the bonding of self-etch adhesive systems to primary dentin. ","953":"One hundred and thirty five extracted premolars were selected and bonded with three types of brackets with different bracket base designs viz. Gemini (foil mesh), Miniature twin (Laser etched) and Mini Dynalocks (Integral base). These brackets were bonded with Transbond XT adhesive using two types of primers viz. Conventional Transbond XT in dry conditions and M.I.P in dry and wet environments. The specimens were tested for SBS using Instron machine at C.I.P.E.T. (Amritsar), Punjab. Results were statistically analyzed. The Miniature twin brackets revealed higher SBS values as compared to Gemini and Mini Dynalock in dry and wet conditions. All the groups showed higher SBS values in dry conditions as compared to wet conditions respectively. The Gemini and Mini Dynalock brackets showed very little difference of SBS values. Miniature twin brackets with laser etched bracket base in dry and wet environments have revealed the highest SBS values.

","954":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of glass fiber-reinforced composite resin (GFRCR) as a space maintainer and to compare it with a conventional band-and-loop space maintainer. A total of 30 children (23 boys and 7 girls) aged 6-8 years were selected for the study. Each of these children required maintenance of space due to premature loss of primary first molars in at least two quadrants. In one quadrant, a GFRCR space maintainer was applied and in the other quadrant a band-and-loop space maintainer was cemented. Patients were recalled at regular intervals over 12 months and retention of both the types of space maintainers was evaluated. The retention of the GFRCR space maintainer was found to be superior to that of the band-and-loop space maintainer, but this difference was not statistically significant.","955":"Bruxism has been defined as a diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional habit. Etiology of bruxism has remained controversial and some investigators believe that psychological factors may play a major role in promoting and perpetuating this habit. The aim of this case-control study was to assess the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders in adolescents., Participants were chosen among 114, 12-14 year old students (girls). They were divided into two groups, bruxers and nonbruxers, on the basis of both validated clinical criteria and interview with each patient. A few participants were excluded on the basis of presence of systemic disorders, TMJ disorders, other oral habits, primary teeth, defective restorations and premature contacts. Following matching of two groups in regard to parent's age and education, mother's marital status, child support status, mother's employment status, and socio-economical status, 25 cases and 25 controls were enlisted. A self report validated questionnaire (YSR, 11-18 yr) was then filled out by both groups for the evaluation of 12 psychosocial symptoms. Remarkable differences in certain psychosocial aspects were found between the two groups. Prevalence of psychosocial disorders including Thought Disorders (P &lt; 0.005), Conduct Disorders (P &lt; 0.05), Antisocial Disorders (P &lt; 0.06) as identified by YSR was significantly higher in bruxers. Significant differences between the two groups also emerged in total YSR scores (P &lt; 0.005). The results of Odds Ratio revealed that a bruxer adolescent has 16 times greater probability for psychosocial disorders than a non-bruxer one. Fischer exact test and T-test were used and Odds Ratio and Confidence Interval was estimated. Support to the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders has been provided. ","956":"Intrusion of immature permanent anterior teeth presents a great dilemma due to variety of treatment options. The ideal treatment option is the one with least probability of developing complications like external root resorption, obliteration of pulp canal, marginal bone loss etc. This paper presents a case report with treatment strategy of repositioning, splinting, successfully attempted apexification and obturation of a completely intruded immature permanent central incisor. Excellent healing with no post-operative complications even after 10 months of follow up.","957":"Concomitant hypodontia and hyperdontia is a rare condition of unknown etiology. One such case of occurring in identical twins in mixed dentition is presented and discussed. A sibling, especially a twin of an affected patient, should be suspected of having a similar problem, even if he or she is asymptomatic. Genetic factors probably play an important etiological role in the co-occurence of partial anodontia and supernumerary teeth.","958":"Cutaneous sinus tract of dental origin is the commonest of the many types of sinus tracts that are formed on the face and neck. Cutaneous sinus tracts may originate from local chronic osteomyelitis (Garre's osteomyelitis). Although the etiological factor is usually periapical infection, they are seldom of periodontal origin. Conventional periapical and panoramic roentgenograms are generally insufficient for diagnosis and treatment planning of cutaneous sinus tracts of periodontal origin. In the present case, computed tomography was used for diagnosis, and osteomyelitis was managed by periodontal treatment.","959":"Dens invaginatus is a developmental malformation of teeth, probably resulting from an infolding of the papilla during tooth development. It predisposes the tooth to develop caries and periapical pathosis. Root canal therapy may present many problems because of the complex anatomy of the teeth. The purpose of this case report is to describe the endodontic treatment of an Oehlers type III dens invaginatus that perforated into the apical area. Calcium hydroxide powder mixed with normal saline, was used as an intracanal medicament. This eradicated the pathogenic microorganisms in the invagination and preserved the vitality of the tooth, allowing gutta-percha obturation in the invagination.","960":"The aim of the study was to assess the common chief complaints of the Indian children and the average age group at which they report for in their first dental visit. A retrospective study was carried out using the case records of 716 children who reported to the postgraduate section of Department of Pediatric dentistry, Meenakshi Ammal Dental College, Chennai, in 2007.

If the unfavorable oral environment that caused the cavity persists so will the disease and more restorations will be required in future. Treating the oral infection by reducing the number of cariogenic microorganisms and establishing a favorable oral environment to promote predominantly remineralization of tooth structure over time will stop the caries process. The present study was conducted: (1) To evaluate the efficacy of povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine mouth rinses on plaque Streptococcus mutans when used as an adjunct to restoration. (2) To compare the anti-microbial effect of 1% povidone-iodine and 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinses on plaque S. mutans count. Forty-five study participants in the age group of 6-12 years with dmft (decay component) of three or four were selected from one government school in Bangalore city. They were divided into three groups after the restorative treatment. Group-A, Group-B, and Group-C received 1% povidone-iodine mouth rinse, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinse and placebo mouth rinse, respectively, twice daily for 14 days. The plaque sample was collected and S. mutans count was estimated at six phases: (1) Baseline, (2) 3 weeks after restoration, (3) First day after mouth rinse therapy, (4) 15 days after mouth rinse therapy, (5) 1 month and (6) 3 months after mouth rinse therapy After the restoration the percentage change in S. mutans count was 28.4%. Immediately after mouth rinse therapy there was significant reduction in S. mutans count in all the three groups. After which the count started to increase gradually and after 3 months the bacterial counts in the povidone-iodine group and placebo group were almost near the postrestorative count. Mouth rinses can be used as adjunct to restoration for short duration as temporary measure in reduction of S. mutans count and restorations provide longer effect.

This cross-sectional study was carried out in Southern Brazil. A random sample of 100 mothers of infants up to 12 months of age was interviewed during the National Vaccination Campaign Day. The prevalence and median duration of breast-feeding were assessed. Breast-feeding practice, the exposure factor, was categorized as exclusive breast-feeding, predominant breast-feeding, complementary breast-feeding, or weaning. Maternal sociodemographic variables included age, race, marital status, educational level, profession, and family income. The outcome investigated was the prevalence of sucking habits (pacifier use and thumb sucking). We used two-sample tests, the chi-square test and FISHER'S EXACT TEST for statistical analyses of the data. The study revealed that 75% of infants were being breast-fed. Pacifier use and thumb sucking were common in 55%. Bottle-feeding was prevalent in 74% of infants. Breast-feeding was negatively correlated with pacifier use and thumb sucking (OR=0.11; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.4). Bottle-feeding was strongly associated with weaning (p=0.0003). Among the sociodemographic variables, only marital status showed a statistical association with sucking habits (p=0.04). These findings suggest that breast-feeding can prevent the occurrence of sucking habits. Although we could not evaluate causality assessment, malocclusion prevention seems to be yet one more reason for promoting breast-feeding practices.","993":"The safe and effective treatment of uncooperative or combative preschool children with extensive dental needs is one of pediatric dentist's ongoing challenges. The traditional methods of behavior management are no longer acceptable to parents as they are not ready to spare more time for dental treatment of their children. Keeping this in mind, the present study was designed and carried out to evaluate the sedative effects of oral ketamine and oral midazolam prior to general anesthesia. Twenty uncooperative children in the age-group of 2-6 years were selected after thorough medical examination and investigations. Informed consent was obtained from the parent. This was a randomized double-blind study. An anesthesiologist administered either 0.5 mg\/kg midazolam or 5 mg\/kg ketamine orally. The heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were recorded at regular intervals. The sedation and anxiolysis scores were also recorded. The parents were asked to answer a questionnaire at the follow-up session the next day on the surgical experience of the parent and the child and side effects experienced, if any. When the data was subjected to statistical analysis, it was observed that both drugs resulted in adequate sedation at the end of 30 min, with oral midazolam providing significantly better anxiolysis. The heart rate and respiratory rate were marginally higher with oral ketamine. The questionnaire revealed a better response with oral midazolam; side effects were more prominent with oral ketamine.","994":"","995":"Intrusive luxation of permanent teeth has great psychologic impact on both parents and children and presents clinical challenge for the dentist, all the more due to severe complications it is difficult to manage this group of dental injuries. This paper describes the management of traumatically intruded permanent maxillary-central incisor in an 11-year-old girl. After 12-month follow-up, it was seen that teeth were fully re-erupted and are in functional alignment with other teeth.","996":"Clefts of the lip and palate are a common craniofacial anomaly, The etiology is thought to be multifactorial, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role. Because of the frequent manifestation of cleft lip and palate in association with some syndromes, it is essential that a detailed examination of these patients be carried out. This facilitates early formulation of preventive and treatment advice and aids in overcoming gross deformities in the early stages of development. In this paper, we review three such patients who presented with cleft lip and palate in association with a syndrome.","997":"Dentinogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant disorder of tooth development characterized by the presence of opalescent dentin, resulting in a dusky blue to brownish discoloration of the teeth. This condition is genetically and clinically heterogeneous; it may affect only the teeth or it may be associated with the osteogenesis imperfecta. Dentinogenesis imperfecta has been subdivided into three types: type I is associated with osteogenesis imperfecta; in type II there is no associated osteogenesis imperfecta; and when the condition is associated with the Brandywine triracial isolate and large pulp chambers it is classified as type III. This report describes a 16-year-old female patient who showed the characteristic dental features of dentinogenesis imperfecta type II. The etiology and prevalence of the disorder, and a comprehensive treatment plan, will be briefly reviewed.","998":"Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by severe deficits in social interaction and communication. A wide spectrum of medical and behavioral symptoms is exhibited by children with autism, which makes routine dental care very difficult in them. Bruxism or forceful grinding of teeth is one of the sleep problems commonly observed in children with autism. Our patient, a 4-year-old male child with autism, presented with complaints of pain and sensitivity of the teeth. There was history of excessive grinding and clenching of teeth. Limited oral examination revealed severe attrition of all primary teeth. Treatment was planned under general anesthesia because of his poor cognitive abilities. Full-mouth rehabilitation, including placement of stainless steel crowns for all primary molars, was done. Following treatment there was a significant decrease in the grinding habit over the next 2 months. Although the communication and behavioral problems in children with autism pose challenges for the dentist, treatment with proper planning and a lot of patience can definitely make a difference.","999":"Papillon-Lefevre syndrome is a very rare syndrome of autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis and early onset of a severe destructive periodontitis, leading to premature loss of both primary and permanent dentitions. Various etiopathogenic factors are associated with the syndrome but a recent report has suggested that the condition is linked to mutations of the cathepsin C gene. Two cases of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome in the same family, having all of the characteristic features, are presented. An 11-year-old girl and a 9-year-old boy presented with the complaints of loose teeth. Both expressed hyperkeratosis of palms, soles, and knees. Severe generalized periodontal destruction, with mobility of teeth, was evident on intraoral examination; orthopantomograph examination showed severe generalized loss of alveolar bone in both the patients.","1000":"The most common dental disease in childhood is dental caries. This study was carried out to recognize the components of saliva which are protective factors in children to evaluate and predict caries susceptible and caries resistant individuals. Unstimulated whole saliva was obtained from 75 children aged 3-5 years. They divided into three groups: decayed missing and filled teeth (dmft) &gt; 6 (severe caries), 1 P &gt; 0.05 ). Although the results showed that salivary phosphate and alkaline phosphatase in caries free group and calcium in the group with severe caries were somewhat more than those in other groups. Despite of the results of the present study, the relationship between salivary components and caries rate in children remains controversial. So more studies are necessary to achieve some practical criteria for predicting dental caries, recognition of susceptible persons, and finally prevention of caries in children.","1001":"Amalgam's non-adhesive characteristics necessitate cavity preparations incorporating retentive features, which often require the removal of non-carious tooth structure. Use of adhesives beneath amalgam restorations, would be helpful to overcome this disadvantage. This study was undertaken to compare the mean shear bond strength of amalgam bonded to primary and permanent dentin, to evaluate the efficacy of amalgam adhesives in pediatric dentistry.27 primary and 28 permanent posterior teeth with intact buccal or lingual surfaces were grounded to expose dentin and wet-polished with 400-grit silicone carbide paper. Scotchbond Multi Purpose Plus adhesive system was applied to the dentin surfaces and light cured. Amalgam was condensed onto the treated dentin through a plastic mold.shear bond strength testing was done using an Instron Universal testing machine, at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm\/min.The data were analyzed by independent samples t-test The difference among the two groups was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05) Bonded amalgam showed the same level of bond strength to primary and permanent dentin; so, application of amalgam bonding agents in pediatric dentistry can be recommended.","1002":"Glucosyltransferases (GTF) play an important role in the adherence of bacteria to acquired pellicle. Cocoa bean husk extract (CBHE) has been shown to possess anti-glucosyltransferase and antibacterial activity. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of CBHE on plaque accumulation and mutans streptococcus count when used as a mouth rinse by children. Scaling of the teeth of the selected children was done and the children were instructed to refrain from their routine oral hygiene practices till the morning of the fourth day; they were instead given a placebo mouth rinse for use during this period. On the fourth day, saliva was collected from each subject for microbiological analysis and plaque was disclosed and scored using the modified Quigley and Hein plaque index; later, the teeth were cleaned. After 1 week, scaling of the subjects was done and they were given CBHE mouth rinse to rinse their mouth, following the above protocol. The data was statistically analyzed using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. There was a 20.9% decrease in mutans streptococci counts and a 49.6% decrease in plaque scores in the CBHE group as compared to the placebo group, which was highly significant (P value Conclusion: CBHE is highly effective in reducing mutans streptococci counts and plaque deposition when used as a mouth rinse by children. ","1003":"An issue of concern in dentistry is the inadequacy of adhesion and proper sealing following restoration of a tooth, which can lead to marginal leakage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a bonding agent on the microleakage of a sealant material following contamination with saliva. In this experimental research, 48 sound premolars were divided into two groups. The first group received sealant without bonding and the other group was given sealant with bonding. After prophylaxis, the occlusal surfaces were etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel and the teeth were then placed in fresh human saliva for l0 s. Following this, in the first group fissure sealant (Kerr) was applied directly and cured; for the second group sealant was placed and cured after bonding (Single Bond; 3M). All samples were thermocycled (500 cycles; between 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C; dwell time of 30 s). Silver nitrate was used as the leakage tracer. The teeth were sectioned. Microleakage evaluation was made by stereomicroscope at 40x magnification and the results were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test. In the group that received sealant without bonding extensive microleakage was seen; placement of sealant with bonding significantly reduced microleakage. In the presence of contamination with saliva, use of bonding under the fissure sealant can reduce microleakage. ","1004":"This study was designed to examine the effect of fissure morphology on penetration and adaptation of fissure sealants and their relationship with the eruption time of tooth. One hundred and fifty extracted molars and premolars were divided into two groups on the basis of their eruption time. The two groups were further divided into five subgroups on the basis of fissure morphology. An scanning electron microscopic analysis of penetration and adaptation of sealant was done. V- and U-shaped fissures were found to have the maximum penetration. Penetration was very poor for I- and IK-types of fissures. No significant difference in penetration was found in relation to eruption time. Adaptation of sealant was not affected by any of the factors. Even the well-applied sealant does not necessarily provide complete obturation of pits and fissures, thus necessitating periodical clinical observation to determine the success or potential failure of the sealant treatment. ","1005":"Endodontic treatment was performed on 25 pulpally involved mandibular primary molars in 4 to 9-year-old children; the root canals were obturated with a new root canal filling material consisting of a mixture of calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide, and 10% sodium fluoride solution, using hand-operated lentulo-spirals. All cases were evaluated clinically every 3 months and also radiographically every 6 months to assess the success of the treatment; we also examined the resorption of the root canal filling material from the root canals and the status of overpushed material, if any, as the tooth resorbed with the passage of time. At 6 months, endodontic treatment in 2 of the 25 teeth had failed and one tooth had exfoliated; the remaining 22 teeth were without any signs or symptoms. At the end of 2 years, 14 teeth could be evaluated; out of these 12 had physiologically exfoliated. It was observed that the rate of resorption of this new root canal obturating mixture was quite similar to the rate of physiologic root resorption in primary teeth. In three cases, where there was an overpush of the mixture, a gradual partial resorption was noted.","1006":"Although the terms lateral secondary and accessory canals are often used interchangeably they mean different things. The accessory canal is derived from the secondary canal branching off to the periodontal ligament in apical sections. Different methodology was used to study the accessory canals. Decalcification method appeared to the important in studying the accessory canals as compared to digital radiography and histological sectioning.","1007":"","1008":"Cleidocranial dysplasias is an autosomal dominant disorder that presents with skeletal dysplasia. The dental manifestations are mainly delayed exfoliation of primary teeth and delayed eruption of permanent teeth, with multiple impacted supernumeraries. This report addresses the complex nature of the treatment modalities. In our patient, surgical exposure of unerupted teeth was done with orthodontic traction. Post-surgical follow-up was uneventful.","1009":"Tooth resorption is a perplexing problem for all dental practitioners. The etiologic factors are vague, the diagnoses are educated guesses and, often, the chosen treatment does not prevent the rapid disappearance of the calcified dental tissues. This becomes all the more confusing if the tooth in question is a pulpally involved young permanent tooth. Presented in this report is the case of an upper first young permanent molar that underwent complete root resorption following root canal therapy and obturation.","1010":"This case report is an insight in to pediatric traumatology whereby bilateral greenstick fracture of condyle is used as a means to discuss the incidence and anatomic considerations for the management of the same, highlighting the fact that dental surgeons require a unique understanding of the anatomy, growth considerations, healing pattern and operative management involving minimal manipulation while managing pediatric facial fractures.","1011":"The mandibular second molars can become impacted beneath the crown of the first molars due to various causes and fail to erupt normally. Presented herewith is a case report of orthodontic uprighting of a mesioangular impacted mandibular right permanent second molar. Though various treatment options were available, an uprighting push spring appliance was used as it is easy to fabricate and produces distal tipping and uprighting of the impacted tooth without the necessity of surgical assistance, bone removal, or splinting. The uprighting of the mandibular second molar was achieved within two months.","1012":"The prevalence of impacted primary teeth has been reported to be very rare and it has been reported to occur in 1:10,000 times, most commonly involving the primary second molars. This report discusses the presence of an impacted inverted maxillary primary incisors and their management by surgical intervention in a 5 year old boy. The inverted primary maxillary central incisors were extracted and prosthetic rehabilitation was done to improve the esthetics, speech and psychosocial behaviour of the child. Co-incidentally the permanent maxillary incisors were also found to be hypoplastic although the parents did not give any history of trauma to the maxillofacial complex. It is important for pediatric dental surgeons to carefully monitor the eruption of primary and permanent teeth for early identification and management of developmental anomalies.","1013":"Witkop's tooth and nail syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of ectodermal dysplasia characterized by hypodontia and nail dysplasia. Mutations in MSX-1 have been shown to be associated with this syndrome. There is failure of development and eruption of the dentition. Tooth shape may vary; the most common forms are conical and narrow crowns. The nails may be spoon shaped and slow growing and affect both finger and toe nails. The nail involvement is more severe in childhood. The present case describes a 14-year-old boy who showed the characteristic features of Witkop's syndrome. A multifaceted approach to the dental management of the patient is discussed.","1014":"Early childhood caries (ECC) is one of the most common diseases of childhood. The etiology of ECC is multifactorial and both genetic and environmental factors play important roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. Genetic variations in the hosts may contribute to changes in the risk for dental caries. Genetic factors such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) have recently been suggested as a predisposing factor. The aim of this study was to look for an association between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 with ECC for developing new strategies for the diagnosis as well as the prevention of the disease. In this study, we extracted the genomic DNAs from whole blood samples of 44 patients with ECC and 35 caries-free children by the salting-out method. We amplified the genomic DNA by PCR-SSP and then HLA-typing was performed for all alleles. The results revealed a significant increase in the frequency of HLA-DRB1*04 in the patient group (P=0.019). The odds ratio for this allele was detected to be 10. The frequency of HLA-DQB1 alleles was not significantly different between the two groups. The above results suggest that HLA-DRB1*04 is associated with the susceptibility to ECC. Thus HLA-DRB1*04 detection as a molecular marker for early diagnosis of ECC may be recommended. ","1015":"Oil pulling has been used extensively for many years, without scientific evidence or proof, as a traditional Indian folk remedy to prevent teeth decay, oral malodor, bleeding gums, dryness of throat and cracked lips, and for strengthening the teeth, gums, and jaws. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oil pulling with sesame oil on the count of Streptococcus mutans in plaque and saliva of children, using the Dentocult SM Strip mutans test, and to compare its efficacy with that of chlorhexidine mouthwash. Twenty age-matched adolescent boys were selected based on information obtained through a questionnaire. They were divided randomly into two groups: the control or chlorhexidine group (group I) and the study or oil pulling group (group II); there were ten subjects in each group. Plaque and saliva samples were collected from all the 20 subjects on the strips from the Dentocult SM kit and, after incubation, the presence of S. mutans was evaluated using the manufacturers' chart. The study group practiced oil pulling with sesame oil and the control group used chlorhexidine mouthwash for 10 min every day in the morning before brushing. Samples were collected from both groups after 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks and the efficacy of oil pulling was compared with that of chlorhexidine mouthwash. There was a reduction in the S. mutans count in the plaque and saliva samples of both the study and the control groups. The reduction in the S. mutans count in the plaque of the study group was statistically significant after 1 and 2 weeks (P=0.01 and P=0.008, respectively); the control group showed significant reduction at all the four time points (P=0.01, P=0.04, P=0.005, and P=0.005, respectively, at 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks). In the saliva samples, significant reduction in S. mutans count was seen in the control group at 48 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks (P=0.02, P=0.02, P=0.008, respectively). Oil pulling can be used as an effective preventive adjunct in maintaining and improving oral health. ","1016":"The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of different water purification systems on the fluoride content of drinking water and to compare the efficacy of these water purification systems in reducing the fluoride content. Five different water purification systems were tested in this study. They were reverse osmosis, distillation, activated carbon, Reviva , and candle filter. The water samples in the study were of two types, viz, borewell water and tap water, these being commonly used by the people of Davangere City, Karnataka. The samples were collected before and after purification, and fluoride analysis was done using fluoride ion-specific electrode. The results showed that the systems based on reverse osmosis, viz, reverse osmosis system and Reviva showed maximum reduction in fluoride levels, the former proving to be more effective than the latter; followed by distillation and the activated carbon system, with the least reduction being brought about by candle filter. The amount of fluoride removed by the purification system varied between the system and from one source of water to the other. Considering the beneficial effects of fluoride on caries prevention; when drinking water is subjected to water purification systems that reduce fluoride significantly below the optimal level, fluoride supplementation may be necessary. The efficacy of systems based on reverse osmosis in reducing the fluoride content of water indicates their potential for use as defluoridation devices.

The mandible is the most frequently fractured facial bone and mandibular alveolar injuries have been reported to range between 8.1-50.6%. Those with mandibular or midface fractures have a higher incidence of associated chest, extremity, abdomen and cervical spine injuries. The growing patient with facial injuries presents the clinician with a series of thought-provoking circumstances. Dentoalveolar and mandibular injuries are especially important to understand because of the potential complications related to tooth eruption, alveolar development, occlusion and facial growth. However, the principles involved in the treatment for children need to be modified by certain anatomical, physiological and psychological factors specifically related to childhood.

Penetration assessment--ten premolars were sealed with each material, isolated (except for the sealed surface) and immersed in 0.2% Rhodamine B. The teeth were serially sectioned in a mesiodistal direction. The images of the sections were digitized and analyzed (ImageLab). The distance between the most superficial and the deepest points on the occlusal central groove was calculated to determine the groove's total depth. The length of the central groove filled with the sealant was divided by its total depth to obtain the percentage of sealing of the occlusal groove. Retention assessment--30 premolars were sealed, their occlusal surfaces were photographed and the area occupied by the sealing materials was demarcated (ImageLab). The teeth were submitted to different treatments: thermocycled, stored in artificial saliva and immersed in acetic acid and saliva (10 cycles\/day protocol for 30 days). New photographs were taken to assess the final area occupied by the materials. The difference between the final and initial area was calculated to obtain the material loss. The data was analyzed (two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test P&lt;0.05). Both materials presented similar penetration of the occlusal central groove.

The objective of present investigation was to study in vitro inhibitory activity of garlic extract on multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Streptococcus mutans isolated from human carious teeth. Filter sterilized aqueous extract of garlic was prepared and used in the present study. For isolation of S. mutans, extracted human carious teeth were cultured in Todd-Hewit broth and Mitis-Salivarius-Bacitracin agar. S. mutans was characterized by colony morphology, biochemical tests and other conventional bacteriological procedures. Disk sensitivity tests and broth dilution methods were used to determine antibiotic sensitivity profile and inhibitory activity of garlic extract on S. mutans isolated from carious teeth. Of 105 carious teeth tested, 92 (87.6%) isolates of S. mutans were recovered, among which 28 (30.4%) were MDR since they were resistant to four or more antibiotics. The highest rate of resistance was observed for tetracycline (30.4%) and least resistance (0%) to teichoplanin and vancomycin while 22.8% and 23.9% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin, respectively. Chlorhexidine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for MDR and non-MDR S. mutans varied from 2 to 16 microg ml(-1) and from 0.25 to 1 microg ml(-1), respectively (P&lt;0.05). All isolates, MDR and non-MDR of S. mutans were sensitive to garlic extract with the MIC ranging from 4 to 32 microg ml(-1). Considering in vitro data obtained in the present study, mouthwashes or toothpaste containing optimum concentration of garlic extract could be used for prevention of dental caries.","1039":"Dental caries is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases and although of multifactorial origin, Streptococcus mutans is considered the chief pathogen in its development.

The aim of this study was to estimate the counts of Streptococcus mutans and to evaluate the effect of Fluor Protector fluoride varnish on these counts in the plaque of caries-free children using Dentocult SM Strip Mutans. Thirty caries-free subjects were selected for the study based on the information obtained from a questionnaire and were randomly assigned to the control group consisting of ten subjects and the study group consisting of twenty subjects. Plaque samples were collected on the strips from the Dentocult SM kit and after incubation, the presence of Streptococcus mutans was evaluated using the manufacturer's chart. The study group was subjected to a Fluor Protector fluoride varnish application following which the samples were collected again after 24 hours. The average Streptococcus mutans counts in the primary dentition of caries-free children before and after the application of Fluor Protector fluoride varnish were 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)\/ml and &lt;10(4) CFU\/ml respectively. The results showed that the study group had a statistically significant reduction in the plaque Streptococcus mutans counts than the control group. ","1040":"A case of melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy occurring in the maxilla in a 13 day old neonate is described. Computed tomography and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis and a submucosal excision was carried out when the infant was 30 days old. But three weeks later the patient reported back with a recurrence and a wide surgical excision was performed. The recurrence may have been caused by incomplete removal of the tumor cells and the initial surgical procedure may have stimulated tumour cell proliferation. Fortunately, 6 month follow up of the patient showed no recurrence.","1041":"Noonan syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by facial dysmorphia, short stature, cardiac defects and skeletal malformations. It may be sporadic or inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait and occurs, one in 1,000-2,500 children. This is a case report of a 13 year-old girl who was referred by a general dental practitioner to a pediatric dentist for management. Full mouth dental rehabilitation was done and the child was brought to a dental institution for correction of orofacial and occlusal defects. Multidisciplinary treatment is the key to success in managing children with Noonan syndrome and the pediatric dentists play an important position to lead the health team.","1042":"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetically derived disorder characterized by the presence of an abnormal hemoglobin molecule, designated as hemoglobin S (HbS). It is one of the most common genetic disorder worldwide, with an estimated 70 million people carrying the sickle gene.

The most common findings include multiple odontogenic keratocysts in the jaws and basal cell nevus on the skin that have an early age onset. These multiple odontogenic keratocysts warrant aggressive treatment at the earliest because of the damage and possible complications associated with them. Recurrence in these lesions is the most characteristic feature that has to be taken in consideration while explaining the prognosis to the patient. A case report of a child affected with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome diagnosed, treated and followed at this hospital is presented here.","1044":"Occlusal pits and fissures are the most susceptible sites for the development of dental caries and prevention is difficult in the areas of occurrence. Although only 12.5% of all the tooth surfaces are occlusal, these surfaces develop more than two-thirds of total caries experienced by children. The fate of the bacteria is of significance when they are inadvertently sealed by a dental sealant. This study aimed in examining the antibacterial properties of three commercially available sealants, viz., Teethmate-F, Helioseal-F and Helioseal. Antibacterial testing was done by disc diffusion method. Selective agars were used to grow Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of dental caries. Statistical analysis was carried out using student's t test. The study proved that Helioseal-F and Helioseal did not possess antibacterial properties and Teethmate-F was the only sealant that showed antibacterial properties.","1045":"Most of Class II malocclusions are due to underdeveloped mandible with increased overjet and overbite. Lack of incisal contact results in the extrusion of the upper and lower anterior dentoalveolar complex, which helps to lock the mandible and prevent its normal growth and development, and this abnormality is exaggerated by soft tissue imbalance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the skeletal and dental changes in patients treated with anterior inclined plane appliance in growing patients with moderate Class II Division 1 having deep overbite. In this study, 25 patients, including 15 girls and 10 boys, with a mean age of 9 +\/-1.2 years were selected; all of them presented with moderate Class II deep bite with increased overjet and normal or horizontal growth pattern. Pre- and post-treatment X-rays and photos for an average of 8 months were taken. The statistical assessment of the data suggested that there were no significant changes in the vertical skeletal parameters. The mandibular incisors were protruded, whereas the maxillary incisors were retruded. Overbite and overjet were also reduced. There was significant increase in the mandibular length. The results revealed that in mixed dentition patients, the inclined plane corrected Class II discrepancies mostly through dentoskeletal changes.","1046":"Research and clinical evidence indicate that most forms of plaque associated periodontal disease start as inflammatory lesions of the gingiva which if left untreated, may progress and eventually involve and compromise the entire periodontal attachment apparatus of the affected teeth. A study was conducted to assess the effect of a mouthrinse containing chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride on plaque accumulation and gingivitis in comparison with a chlorhexidine mouthrinse alone in a group of school children aged 13-16 years in Bangalore city. This combination along with the well established effect of fluoride in the prevention of caries presents an important contribution to dental public health. The results suggest that the chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride mouthrinse potentially possesses a significant effect on inhibition of plaque accumulation and gingivitis. This combination along with the well-established effect of fluoride in the prevention of caries, presents an important contribution to dental public health.","1047":"In this study, the effects of 0.2% sodium fluoride mouthwash solution on calcium, phosphate and fluoride ion contents of saliva and microbial plaque was assessed. Fourteen volunteer students (7-12 years of age) of a boarding educational centre in Kerman City (Iran) were selected and under defined conditions, their saliva and plaque samples were collected. The concentrations of fluoride, calcium and phosphate ions of the samples were determined, and after 14 days, under the same conditions, the students were asked to rinse their mouth with 0.2% sodium fluoride mouthwash solution. The second set of saliva and plaque samples were collected and the concentrations of the ions were determined. Data was analyzed using paired t-test and the results were presented as tables.

The results showed that airotor was the most efficient method (mean value 0.38), while carisolv was the least painful (mean value 0.080) and the most time consuming method (534.8 seconds).","1055":"The purpose of this investigation was to estimate the impact strength of fractured anterior teeth reattached using three different restorative materials and compare their impact strengths to those of control. Sixty human maxillary permanent central incisors were selected and divided into control and experimental groups. The teeth in the experimental groups were fractured and then bonded using Composite resin, Compomer and resin-modified GIC. Intact teeth served as control. All the specimens were then tested in an impact testing machine. The results revealed statistically significant differences between Compomer and resin-modified GIC groups, control and experimental groups. No statistically significant differences were observed between Composite resin and Compomer groups. Thus the fractured fragments bonded with Composite resin and Compomer provided better adhesion than resin-modified GIC. ","1056":"Glass ionomer cement, besides being used as restorative material, can also be used as pit and fissure sealant. The use of glass ionomer cement as pit and fissure sealant has added benefit by its fluoride-releasing property that results in increased resistance of the fissures to demineralize. The capacity of a sealant to prevent microleakage into the fissure is important, since microleakage may initiate and support a carious lesion beneath the sealant. The study was carried out to compare marginal microleakage between Fuji-VII glass ionomer cement (G C Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and the conventional light-cured unfilled resin as pit and fissure sealants (3M Concise, 3M Dental Products, St. Paul, USA). The dye used was 2% methylene blue (Qualigens Fine Chemicals, Mumbai, India). The teeth were sectioned and studied under the stereomicroscope.

The study was a randomized 4 cell, examiner blind cross-over design assessing the plaque removal efficacy of all four brushes on a single occasion. Sixteen subjects aged 14-15 years participated in the study. On day 1 of each test period, the subjects were rendered plaque free and were asked to suspend oral hygiene practices for 24 hours. On day 2, the subjects were scored for plaque prior to brushing using the Turesky-Gilmore modification of Quigley-Hein plaque index. The subjects then brushed with the allocated toothbrush for 2 minutes and the post-brushing plaque scores were assessed. A wash-out period of 4 days was allowed between the test periods. All the brushes showed a significant reduction in the post-brushing plaque scores ( p &lt; 0.001). The mean reduction in the plaque scores for all the brushes was around 53%. The percentage plaque reduction was greater in the anterior surface than the posterior surface (59.6 +\/- 7.45% vs. 49.83 +\/- 4.35%). The percentage plaque reductions in the upper, lower, buccal and lingual surfaces were similar. No significant difference in the reduction of plaque scores between the four brushes was seen. The data derived from the study supports the contention of many researchers that there is no single superior design of manual toothbrush. Though minor and some site differences in favor of the brushes were seen, they were not statistically significant. ","1059":"The purpose was to evaluate two sedation protocols during dental sessions in anxious children. It was a randomized and double-blind study, with each individual being his\/her own control within each protocol. Furthermore, the two protocols were compared. Twenty children (36 to 84 months old) who exhibited \"definitely negative\" behavior according to the Frankl scale were assigned to receive oral chloral hydrate (40 mg\/kg) (Group I) or Diazepam (5 mg) (Group II). Behavior during local anesthesia, application of rubber dam, cavity preparation, restorative procedures was evaluated, considering the degree of sleep, body movement, crying and overall behavior. Vital signs were assessed at three different times. The Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Exact Fisher's and Spearman correlation tests were used to analyze the data. Group I presented higher scores for sleep during the CH session than placebo session during rubber dam application (P = 0.0431) and restoration (P = 0.0431). In Group II there was no statistically significant difference (p &gt; 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between sessions and groups in the evaluation of body movement, crying and vital signs. Overall behavior in the placebo session was better than in the CH session during local anesthesia, but there was no difference between the two drug regimens.

When observed with erupted and complete dentition the diagnosis is a surprise; as about 95% of dentigerous cysts involve the permanent dentition and only 5% are associated with supernumerary teeth. The usual age of clinical presentation of dentigerous cyst due to supernumerary tooth is during the first four decades. Mesiodens is a supernumerary tooth situated between the maxillary central incisors. More frequently the mesiodens occurs unilaterally, but it may also be bilateral, while three or more supernumerary teeth in the median region of the palate are more rarely found.

The space can occur either as a transient malocclusion or created by developmental, pathological or iatrogenical factors. Many innovative therapies varying from restorative procedures such as composite build-up to surgery (frenectomies) and orthodontics are available. Although literature says every frenectomy procedure should be preceded by orthodontic treatment, we opted for frenectomy technique without any orthodontic intervention. Presented herewith is a case report of a 9-year-old girl with a high frenal attachment that had caused spacing of the maxillary central incisors. A spontaneous closure of the midline diastema was noted within 2 months following frenectomy. The patient was followed up for 4 months after which the space remained closed and there was no necessity for an orthodontic treatment at a later stage.","1072":"Many industrialized countries have reported a decline in caries prevalence over the past few decades. These reductions have been related to the regular use of fluoride dentifrices. Fluoride dentifrices are the most cost-effective and efficient means of caries prevention. However, there have been concerns regarding the risk of fluorosis in children due to the ingestion of dentifrices. This has led to the use of dentifrices with low concentration of fluoride. Salivary fluoride levels after tooth-brushing have been shown to be related to the anticaries efficacy of fluoride dentifrices. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of the concentration of fluoride in the dentifrice, on the salivary fluoride level in children. Twenty children in the age group of five to six years were randomly selected and divided into two groups using, either 500ppm or 1000ppm fluoride dentifrice (sodium monofluorophosphate). Salivary fluoride levels at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, minutes after brushing were estimated. The data collected was statistically evaluated using the unpaired t-test. The results showed that salivary fluoride levels following use of 500ppm fluoride dentifrice were significantly lower than 1000ppm fluoride dentifrice. The low salivary fluoride levels may thereby reduce the anticaries efficacy. Hence, the pros and cons of recommending a low fluoride concentration dentifrice must be judiciously considered.","1073":"A study was conducted to evaluate the level of oral health awareness in a selected sample of Indian children and a selected sample of western children residing in Amritsar city of Punjab.

Lack of community water fluoridation, dental workforce shortages and geographical barriers all aggravate oral health and access problems. Children from low-income and minority families and children with special needs are at particular risk. Family centered disease prevention strategies are needed to reduce oral health disparities in children. Oral health promotion can take place in a primary care practitioner's office, but medical providers often lack relevant training. Present study was conducted to evaluate knowledge and attitude of graduating medical students towards infant oral health qualitative methods were used to evaluate the program.","1085":"Children are uniquely susceptible to cranio facial trauma because of their greater cranial mass to body ratio. Below the age of 5, the incidence of pediatric facial fractures in relation to the total is very low ranging from 0.6-1.2%. Maxillo-facial injuries may be quite dramatic causing parents to panic and the child to cry uncontrollably with blood, tooth and soft tissue debris in the mouth. The facial disfigurement caused by trauma can have a deep psychological impact on the tender minds of young children and their parents. This case report documents the trauma and follow up care of a 4-year-old patient with maxillofacial injuries.","1086":"This article presents case report of a patient with radicular cyst associated with a primary molar with an unusual clinical presentation. The management comprised of enucleation of the cystic sac under general anesthesia.","1087":"A rare case of aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) located in the coronoid process of the mandible in a 12-year-old girl is presented. Treatment consisted of excision of the lesion through preauricular, submandibular and intraoral approach. An access osteotomy distal to second molar region was required to gain access to medial side of the coronoid process. To our knowledge, this is the third case of an aneurysmal bone cyst of the coronoid process of mandible. While examining a patient with a large expansile intrabony jaw cavity with thin peripheral bone, which is filled with blood without presence of bruit, thrills and pulse pressure, the diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst should be on top of the differential diagnosis list. Seventy-four to eighty-five percent of aneurysmal bone cysts of jaws occur in 10-20 years age group. Therefore, a pediatric dentist may be the first person to see such a lesion.","1088":"Dilaceration of permanent successors is one of the most common complications of trauma to the deciduous teeth.

A multi-stage random sampling oral epidemiological survey was conducted in private and government, urban, rural town and rural village schools in 15 illakas of Sunsari District, Eastern Nepal. A total of 600, 12-13-year-old and 600 15-year-old school children were examined by trained examiners using the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S). The average age-group, debris and calculus index scores were combined to obtain the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S). The mean OHI-S scores were compared and evaluated using the parametric t-test for two independent samples. The mean OHI-S for urban 12-13-year-old school children was 0.98 compared to 1.34 for school children of rural towns and 1.44 for school children of rural villages and these differences in mean OHI-S were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.005). In the 15-year-old age group, urban school children had a mean OHI-S score of 1.00 compared to 1.37 for rural towns and 1.43 for rural villages. The variance in the mean OHI-S scores were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.005). The overall level of cleanliness in the school children surveyed was good. Children of urban schools had the lowest scores followed by school children from rural towns and then rural villages. When the mean OHI-S scores were compared with the DMFT scores, there was an inverse relationship between oral cleanliness and dental caries. Frequency of sugar consumption and the availability and affordability of fluoridated toothpaste may be important factors in the development of dental caries than oral cleanliness.","1090":"The purpose of this present study was to determine the pH changes of five different commercially available calcium hydroxide liners and variations of pH at different time intervals. The following commercially available materials were investigated: Dycal (LD Caulk); Calcimol (Vocco Products); calcium hydroxide powder (Deepti Products); Calcimol LC (Vocco Products); Lime-Lite (Pulpdent Corporation). Five samples were prepared from each liner. The pH measurements were recorded at time intervals of 1 h, 24 h, 3 days and 7 days after mixing of the liner. The pH variations of each material at the given time intervals were recorded and the means were calculated. Comparison of the mean values at all time intervals with the statistical analysis showed significantly high differences (P &lt; 0.001) between pH values induced by each material at all time intervals. Among the water-insoluble products, Dycal had the strongest alkaline effect after 7 days interval. The materials that chemically hardened produced higher pH values than materials that hardened by a visible light source after 7 days.","1091":"To correlate sodium-potassium levels in saliva of pediatric patients having different intensities of toothache assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in age group 3-14 yrs. A prospective study of 50 children having different intensities of pain was carried out in the Dept. of Pedodontics, Sareetha Dental College and Hospital. 50 children (aged 3-14 yrs) having different intensities of toothache including normal children (control) were included in the study. Saliva samples were collected and Na+, K+ levels in saliva were measured by using Na+, k+ colorimeter kit. Photographs were taken using Digital camera and VAS was prepared accordingly.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the physiological force of the tongue to move the maxilla in forward position. This research has been done experimentally by, before and after treatment following up in private practice. Ten patients (6 female, 4 male) with complete bilateral cleft lip and palate were selected. All of them had Cl III malocclusion with maxillary deficiency due to scar tissue of lip and palate surgery. Their age ranged from 7.6 to 9.8 years. All the patients were delivered tongue appliance to transfer the force of the tongue to maxillary complex. The mean observation time was 13+\/-2 months to achieve positive overjet. Pre- and post-lateral cephalograms were compared to evaluate the skeletal changes with paired t-test. The results showed that after the application of tongue appliance, normal sagittal maxillomandibular relationship was achieved. SN-ANS angle was increased 1.9+\/-1.8 - P &lt; 0.03. This study showed that the tongue appliance could transfer considerable force during rest and swallowing period to the maxilla. This method might be considered to improve the deficient maxilla by means of growth modification and redirect concept.","1093":"A comparative evaluation of hand wrist and cervical vertebrae was done to know the validity of cervical vertebrae as maturity indicators. A sample of 50 subjects (25 females and 25 males) in the age group of 10-12 years were selected on criteria of normal occlusion and the result showed that cervical vertebrae can be used with the same confidence as hand wrist radiographs to evaluate skeletal maturity, thus avoiding the need for an additional radiograph.","1094":"The purpose of this study was to test the support to undermined occlusal enamel provided by posterior restorative composite (FiltekTM P60, 3M Dental products USA), polyacid modified resin composite (F2000 compomer, 3M Dental products, USA.), radiopaque silver alloy-glass ionomer cement (Miracle Mix. GC Corp, Tokyo, Japan) and Glass Ionomer cement (Fuji IX GP). To test each material, 20 human permanent mandibular third molars were selected. The lingual cusps were removed and the dentin supporting the facial cusps was cut away, leaving a shell of enamel. Each group of prepared teeth was restored using the materials according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the specimens were thermocycled (250 cycles, 6 degrees C- 60 degrees C, dwell time 30 seconds) and then mounted on an acrylic base. Specimens were loaded evenly across the cusp tips at a crosshead speed of 5 mm \/minute in Hounsfield universal testing machine until fracture occurred. Data obtained was analyzed using analysis of variance and Studentized- Newman- Keul's range test. No significant differences were detected in the support provided by P-60, F 2000, Miracle Mix or Fuji IX GP groups. The support provided to undermined occlusal enamel by these materials was intermediate between no support and that provided by sound dentin. Without further development in dental material technology and evidence of its efficacy, restorative materials should not be relied upon to support undermined occlusal enamel to a level comparable to that provided by sound dentin.","1095":"It is well recognized today that for long-term success, the management of traumatized teeth optimally should be carried out as soon as possible. Since, majority of traumatic injuries occur at home, the ultimate prognosis of an avulsed tooth may depend on knowledge of the treatment procedure, possessed by his or her parents.

Total 157 cases of OSMF and 135 control subjects were selected for study in the period of 2002-2004. It was observed that Male:Female ratio was 2.7:1. The youngest case of OSMF was 11 year old and the oldest one was 54 years of age. Maximum number of cases were belonging to 21-40 years of age and they were belonging to low or middle socioeconomic class. Most of the OSMF cases used heavy spices and chillies, where as control mild spices and chillies. Gutkha was the most commonly used by the OSMF cases only 3 per cent did not use any gutkha or other areca nut product where as 80 per cent control did not have any chewing habit. The OSMF cases used gutkha and other products 2-10 pouches per day and kept in the mouth for 2-10 minutes and they were using since 2-4 years. Most of the OSMF cases kept gutkha in the buccal vestibule or they chewed and swallowed it, only a small number of patients chewed and spitted it out. It was also observed that OSMF developed on one side of the buccal vestibule where they kept the chew and other side was normal.","1116":"The role of tongue thrust has often been suspected, long debated and largely dispelled as a primary etiological factor of malocclusion. However, tongue thrust may contribute to poor occlusal intercuspation both during and after treatment. A tongue thrust may also develop during orthodontic mechanotherapy as a result of the transient creation of intra and interarch spaces and this little recognized phenomenon was found to occur in many randomly followed cases. In many instances, this seemingly adaptive and secondary response of the tongue posture and function may persist and thereafter impede the resolution of intra and interarch problems.","1117":"Oratest, a caries activity test was performed on 48 school going children of Mangalore city to estimate efficacy of the test.

However, in spite of the technique having been used for over 15 years, no concrete long term results are available regarding the stability of results. We discuss the various studies which have reported either in favour or against the stablility of results after distraction. We report a series of 6 cases (3 unilateral and 3 bilateral distraction) where distraction was carried out before puberty and followed them up to seven years after removal of distractors. This case series shows that results achieved by distraction osteogenesis are unstable or best unpredictable with respect to producing a permanent size increase in the mandible. The role of the distraction osteogenesis in overcoming the pterygomassetric sling is questionable. We suggest a multicenter study with adequate patient numbers treated with a similar protocol and documented after growth cessation to have meaningful conclusions on the debate of distraction osteogenesis versus orthognathic surgery.","1126":"The present study was carried out to find out the amount of cariogenic and cariostatic trace elements in mixed saliva.

The handicapped children are unable to maintain their oral hygiene properly. The present study was formulated with the aim that does normalization of oral anatomy have its effect on improvement of oral hygiene? An assessment of oral hygiene index-simplified was performed between preoperative and postoperative values in the same patient at KGMU and KGDU. A total of 50 cases were recorded in two groups of 25 each: (i) 6 years. The observations are statistically analyzed by paired 't' test to get the significance of results. The data analyzed showed the significant decrease in oral hygiene indices observed in both groups. A relative significance in oral hygiene status following surgery was observed. Both groups expressed greater significance when compared pre and postoperatively which is indicative of considerable improvement of oral hygiene after surgical correction. The study concludes that oral hygiene improves more in older cleft lip-palate cases following reconstruction of palatal vault, premaxilla and anterior lip seal by secondary bone grafting method when compared with oral hygiene indices results in primary periosteoplasty cases. The surgical correction of cleft lip palate enhances self-cleaning ability and better compliance to maintain oral hygiene in children as the age advances. ","1137":"In humans, the development of the primary palate and the lip is completed by the 7th week of intra uterine life and that of secondary palate by 12th week. The dermal ridges develop in relation to the volar pads, which are formed by the 6th week of gestation and reach maximum size between 12th and 13th weeks. This means that the genetic message contained in the genome--normal or abnormal is deciphered during this period and is also reflected by dermatoglyphics. Hence this study was done in order to observe the differences in dermatoglyphic patterns between the children with oral clefts and normal children and to determine the usefulness of dermatoglyphics in studying the genetic etiology of oral clefts. Dermatoglyphic data from 50 oral cleft children and 50 normal children were collected using the ink method and comparison was done between them. In the present study, we found an increase in the ulnar loop patterns on the distal phalanges of the ten fingers, an increase in the atd angle and an increase in the fluctuating asymmetry of the atd angle in the oral cleft children which indicates the degree of developmental instability of the oral cleft individual.","1138":"Concept of creating mechanical retention for bonding through crystal growth has been successfully achieved in the present study. By using polyacrylic acid, sulphated with sulphuric acid as etchant, abundant crystal growth was demonstrated. Keeping in view the obvious benefits of crystal growth technique, the present SEM study was aimed to observe and compare the changes brought about by different etching agents (phosphoric acid, polyacrylic acid and polyacrylic acid sulphated) and to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in an attempt to reduce iatrogenic trauma caused due to surface enamel alteration.

The mass was surgically excised.","1146":"Muscular activity of the lips, cheeks, and the tongue are important factors, which not only guide the occlusal development but also affect the growth of the jaws. Bottle feeding has been known to cause a myriad of changes in the oro-facial development. But the adverse effects of feeding practices with respect to developing dentition has been a subject of controversy. Hence a study was designed with the aim and objectives to check the commonly adopted feeding practices in South Kanara, to compare the occlusion of 3- to 5-year-old children with breast feeding, bottle feeding or combination, and to check whether prolonged feeding has any adverse influence on developing dentition. A total of 250 questionnaires were distributed to parents of 3- to 5-year-old children of which 153 were chosen for recording the impression and for studying the occlusion under various parameters. The results of the study indicated definite potential hazards of prolonged breast and bottle feeding especially with a tendency to develop openbite and posterior crossbite. It also suggested that an early preventive and interceptive approach.","1147":"The prevalence of the most common dental disease, dental caries has been a subject of intense debate due to its importance in statistical measurement and for the clinical control of this disease. Kulasekharam, a small village, situated in Kanyakumari District has a large number of hospitals and a dental college; yet the people seem to have a very poor knowledge about dental health. This prompted us to do a study among school children in the age group of 6-12 years to assess the prevalence of dental caries and to increase their awareness toward oral health. This paper further strives to find any correlation between patient awareness and prevalence of dental decay. The dental caries prevalence was noted to be low compared to the WHO-recommended values. The fluoride level was also tested and was found to be far below the optimal level.","1148":"Root canal morphology of deciduous mandibular first molar was studied using roentgenographic and decalcification and clearing methods. Two groups of 15 teeth were formed. In the roentgenographic group, roots of the teeth were separated from the crown at the level of CEJ. Cut roots of the teeth were radiographed from both mesiodistal and buccolingual directions using separate IOPA films. In the decalcification and clearing group, teeth were decalcified and made transparent. Dye was injected later. The roots of the teeth were examined under 10 times for number, curvature, types and additional features of root canals. Deciduous mandibular first molar showed variability in root canal morphology. Four to five root canals were recorded. Majority of the teeth had 1-1 type of root canal anatomy, but 1-2 type anatomy was also reported. Straight, curved and S-shaped canal curvatures were recorded. Horizontal anastomosis, lateral canals and buccolingually broad root canals were also recorded.","1149":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Dental Health Education programs among school children of different socioeconomic groups. The investigators made a visit to three different schools and studied 500 children. A ten items, open-ended, self-administered questionnaire was pretested on the primary and higher primary school children before and after an educational intervention. A second visit was made to one of the schools 1 year later and the same questionnaire was re-administered to those subjects who had participated in the original study. Results showed that although educational intervention was successful in improving the Dental health awareness of most children, the socioeconomic background is an important determinant for the same. Also, single-lecture technique seems to be inadequate in improving the knowledge of children in the long term.","1150":"Bacteriocins are bacteriocidal proteinaceous molecules produced by the Gram-positive bacteria not active against the produced strain. Many investigations have revealed that certain bacteria using antibacterial or the inhibitory substance inhibit some other bacteria. A study was conducted in a group of 60 children to ascertain whether any correlation exists between the proportion of salivary bacteria inhibiting and stimulating Streptococcus mutans and the oral health indices (DMFT, deft and Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs). A definite inverse correlation was observed between the percentage of salivary inhibiting S. mutans and untreated carious teeth (UCT).","1151":"To compare the accuracy of root canal lengths in primary teeth determined by tactile sense, electronic apex locator, conventional radiography, and digital radiography in primary teeth. The study sample consisted of twenty 20 extracted, single-rooted primary teeth.

No statistically significant differences were seen between the techniques.","1152":"Diet control is one of the important factors in the prevention of dental caries because food functions as substratum for fermentation and, consequently, for the formation of the organic acids that demineralize the tooth surface. This study aims to descriptively assess school diet and the associated caries-preventive methods applied to children in all municipal nursery schools of a Brazilian city (Aragatuba\/SP). For this, a questionnaire with open and closed questions was used. The results showed that all schools serve school meal, which is composed mainly of sugar, carbohydrates, and proteins. The students enjoy the meal very much because for most of them, the meal served at school is the only source of food. It was observed that 90% of the schools offer other kinds of food besides the main school meal. The snacks served such as cakes, white hominy, and milk fudge are composed of sweet and highly cariogenic foods. It was also verified that in 13.30% of the schools, the daily supervised dental hygiene, an important procedure that should not be neglected, is not carried out. This procedure introduces the children to healthy habits that are added to those acquired in the family environment. It was concluded that the school diet is potentially cariogenic and, in association with the lack of daily dental hygiene, this potential may become even higher.","1153":"The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors of dental caries in preschool children in Istanbul. Five nursery schools in Istanbul were included and results of 598 students' were collected. Subjects were orally examined. Socio-demographic data were obtained from the records and from parents.

For qualitative and quantitative analysis of streptococcus mutans, saliva samples are often preferred and are processed according to Kohler and Brathall method. In the present study an attempt is made to relate caries status (caries free, average caries, and rampant caries group) with cfu counts of streptococcus mutans and Snyder test. The streptococcus mutans were isolated using MSB agar and cfu were determined of each individual from different caries groups. The saliva of the same individual was drooled into a culture bottle containing Snyder test agar and extent of colour change was observed after 24, 48, and 72 hours incubated at 37 degrees C. The time and extent of colour change determined the conduciveness of diet. It has been observed that caries free individuals have low cfu count and their diet was mild or moderately conducive, while the individuals having average caries had medium cfu count and their diet was moderately-high conducive. In rampant caries, individuals however the cfu count were high and the diet was highly conducive. In caries free, average caries and rampant caries group 40, 60, and 80 per cent samples showed colour change, in Snyder test up to full length in 72 hours respectively. Thus a definite correlation exists between caries status, cfu count of streptococcus mutans and Snyder caries activity test.","1324":"Apexification is the most widely accepted procedure for the treatment of nonvital immature teeth. Single visit apexification is less time consuming, more economical and an easily acceptable technique with the aim of inducing the formation of a hard tissue barrier, thus allowing proper condensation of gutta percha in the root canal. Factors considered during this procedure are: i. Debridement of root canal minimizing the infection and filling the root canal space with resorbable calcification inducing material i.e. Ca(OH)2. ii. Minimal mechanical intervention to maintain the integrity and vascularity of apical region. Once filled, Ca(OH)2 was not changed again and the treated tooth was examined only radiographically till the desired apical closure was achieved. Three representative cases treated with this single visit apexification technique are discussed here. In all the cases successful apical closure of different types was achieved. Treatment was then concluded with gutta percha obturation in all the cases with successful follow up.","1325":"The present study was carried out to assess the prevalence and distribution of the traumatic injuries to anterior teeth among 4500 school children in the age group of 3 to 16 years from South Kanara District of Karnataka.

It is characterized by defective formation of both enamel and dentin, with enlarged pulp chambers and root canals with open apices. It is usually a localised condition where one or few teeth may be involved. Sometimes, an entire quadrant or more than one quadrant may be involved but generalized involvement is extremely rare. An interesting case of a generalized odontodysplasia affecting both primary and permanent dentition in an eight year old girl is presented here.","1327":"The rubber dam was first developed and put to use in the 19th century by S.C. Barnum. Since then, the use of the rubber dam in dentistry has become mandatory especially during root canal treatment. Various irrigation solutions which are used during root canal treatment have toxic effects on the soft tissues around the teeth. This can be prevented or minimized when rubber dam is put to use. Similarly for esthetic dentistry, optimum results are obtained if the working area is protected from contamination by saliva.","1328":"This epidemiological survey attempted to establish the level of dental caries and treatment need among the municipal school children of Mumbai. The prevalence of dental caries was 68.02% which increased with age. The lowest DMFT score was recorded in the 12 year age group while the highest DMFT Score was recorded in 15 year age group. Decayed teeth accounted for the greatest percentage of DMF teeth followed by the missing and filled components in all the age groups. Single surface restorations accounted for the greatest percentage of treatment need followed by two or more surface restorations and extractions.","1329":"","1330":"This study was conducted on 30 extracted human primary molars to assess the retentive strengths of zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate and glass ionomer cements. The teeth were embedded in resin blocks and were randomly divided into 3 groups of 10 each. The occlusal surfaces of all teeth were reduced uniformly by 1.0 to 1.5 mm. All mesial, distal undercuts were removed and sharp angles rounded. This was followed by cementing pretrimmed and precontoured stainless steel crowns on each tooth with hand pressure and storing in artificial saliva at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Retentive strength was tested using Instron Universal Testing Machine. The load was applied starting from a zero reading and gradually increased until the cemented stainless steel crowns showed signs of movement and then the readings were recorded. It was found that retentive strengths of zinc phosphate and glass ionomer cements were statistically better (P &lt; 0.05) when compared to the polycarboxylate cement. Negligible difference (0. 59 kg\/cm2) was however observed between zinc phosphate and glass ionomer cements.","1331":"An eleven year old girl reported to J. S. S. Dental College with spontaneous pain in the left mandibular region. On examination, left mandibular second premolar was found to be hypoplastic and grossly destroyed. On radiographic evaluation, an uncommon variation of bifurcation at the apical one third of the root was seen while the contralateral tooth was normal. Treatment planning included extraction of the tooth and evaluation of the morphodifferentiation which showed a webbed appearance in the bifurcated root contrary to the radiographic finding. This webbed appearance could be due to hypomineralisation due to trauma to the developing roots from the infection of its predecessors.","1332":"This epidemiological investigation was conducted on a sample of 3164 rural children aged 6-15 years in Raipur Rani and Naraingarh blocks in the district of Ambala in Haryana. 29. 2 percent of rural children were found to have malocclusion whereas 70.8 per cent had normal occlusion. Class I malocclusion was found to be maximum in 14.4 per cent of children, while malocclusion with class II molar relationship was observed in 13.5 per cent of children. Malocclusion with Class III molar relationship was seen in 1.3 per cent of the population studied. Three per cent of rural children were found to have abnormal oral habits, predominantly tongue thrusting and thumb sucking. The frequency distribution of abnormal oral habits in children with malocclusion was found to be 10.3 per cent.","1333":"A study of prevalence and severity of dental caries was undertaken in seven nursery schools of Akola city in the age group of 5-6 years. A total of 508 children were examined out of which 288 were boys and 220 girls. The examination for dental caries and data collection was carried out as per W.H.O. (1987) criteria. Out of the total 508 children examined 61.41% were observed to be having caries with mean dmft\/dmfs of 2.75+\/-3.98 &amp; 4.04+\/-6.84 respectively. Total 17.91% school children were found to be having decay in either all upper or lower molars. In the high risk caries group 0.98% children were found to be affected with nursing caries and 0.2% children with rampant caries. Only a negligible proportion of filled teeth (1.42%) and missing due to caries (0.14%) was observed in the population. Occlusal surface caries was the most prevalent type of decay (44.71) and the mandibular deciduous second molars were the most affected by caries. Due to high prevalence of dental caries (61.41%) research must be carried out in the direction of identification of the children population at high risk of caries, so that a rigorous preventive programme be implemented.","1334":"Management of traumatic injuries to the teeth is a challenge to the practising dentist. It has no prescriptive method for occurring, possesses no significant predictable pattern of intensity or extensiveness and occurring at times when dentists are least prepared for it. It may not only leave physical scars but also a psychological impact on its victim. Yet, more than half of all children traumatize either their primary or permanent teeth before leaving the school, coupled with the dynamic panorama of sporting activity worldwide and the significant increase in violence among the populations. Tooth trauma and its management loom as a major challenge to the dental practitioner. A case of a 11 year old boy with Ellis Class 3 traumatic injury to the maxillary left central incisor is reported. A pulpectomy was performed followed by reinforcement and reattachment of the crown fragment and restoration with composite resin.","1335":"Tongue, because of its surface texture contributes significantly in plaque formation and accumulation, has remained a neglected part in the oral cavity. The study conducted on twenty students aged 18 to 23 years, was undertaken to clinically evaluate the role of supplementing tongue brushing to most advocated regime of tooth brushing. In both the phases of the study, plaque scoring was done daily and oral debris was collected on the eighth day. It was observed that tongue brushing when supplemented to the most advocated regime of tooth brushing that is, immediately after breakfast in the morning and immediately after dinner at night significantly reduced the initial rate of plaque formation and total plaque accumulation.","1336":"There is a paucity of data on the amount of fluoride absorbed in humans from whole cooked food; especially a combination of different foods taken at regular meal times. The present study was thus aimed at estimating the amount of fluoride present and absorbed in humans from four regional representative meals viz. North Indian Vegetarian, North Indian Non-vegetarian, South Indian and East Indian. Twenty five healthy human volunteers aged 22-35 years participated in the study and each diet was tested on five volunteers. Each test diet was weighed into six equal parts, one part was kept for estimation of fluoride content and remaining five were given one each to the five test subjects in each of the four test diet groups. Eight hour plasma fluoride profiles were then studied after ingestion of weighed quantity of test diets and means calculated. The bioavailability of fluoride from these diets was evaluated in relation to that of sodium fluoride in solution form. The amount of fluoride estimated in different test diets varied between 1.53 - 10.0 mg. The bioavailability was found to be 1.6 per cent for north Indian vegetarian diet, 7.5 per cent for east Indian diet, 14.4 per cent for north Indian nonvegetarian diet and 31.7 per cent for south Indian diet, however, the amount of F(mg) absorbed in plasma from these diets was found to be low i.e. 0.06 mg, 0.75 mg, 0.72 mg and 0.48 mg respectively.","1337":"A case of transmigration of mandibular canine is presented.

It was observed that all the groups early (8 to &lt; or = 24 months), medium (&gt; 24 to &lt; or = 36 months) and late repair (&gt; 36 to &lt; or = 78 months) had significantly larger cranial base, retruded maxillomandibular relations, skeletodental and incisal relationships compared to the noncleft children. However, intercomparison among the cleft groups showed insignificant difference amongst them suggesting that the timing of palatal repairs does not effect the anterioposterior (sagittal) relationship.","1346":"Talon cusp is a type of developmental anomaly affecting coronal portion of tooth in cingulum region, rarely found in the deciduous dentition.","1347":"Cleft lip and palate is one of the most common malformations in man. Although the subject of a great deal of investigation, etiologic factors contributing to these congenital deformities remain largely unknown. Various factors like race, sex, parental age at the time of conception etc. have been listed as the exogenous factors. This article strives to project any significant relationship of these factors to cleft lip and cleft palate.","1348":"A retrospective study of 30 cases of mesiodens is presented. male preponderance of 1.5:1. was 64% mesiodens were impacted and 36% erupted. Inverted impacted mesiodens was seen in 62.5% of the impacted mesiodens. 66.6% cases had 2 mesiodens per case. The harmful effects on the dentition were mostly crowding, rotation, diastema and impacted permanent incisor.","1349":"Cleft lip and palate is a severe birth defect occurring approximately one in 800-1000 newborn infants. The incidence varies widely among races. Cleft lip and palate together account for approximately 50% of all cases whereas isolated cleft lip and isolated cleft palate occur in about 25% of cases.

Presented here is a 3 day old infant with bilateral cleft lip and palate and phocomelia for whom a feeding obturator was made and delivered to facilitate feeding.","1350":"Dental caries is the prime cause of premature loss of teeth in children. Tea contains high percentage of fluoride along with polyphenolic constituents which act on GTF of S. mutans in plaque synthesis. Combination of fluoride and polyphenolic constituents inhibit caries activity.","1351":"The case presented here is a 6 year old male child with oto-mandibulo-facial dysostosis syndrome. Oto-mandibulo-facial dysostosis is a term used for a unilateral congenital birth defect in which abnormalities can range from minor unilateral ear anomalies or preauricular tags to severe ones involving anotia and mandibular hypoplasia.","1352":"Treatment plan for a child requires a complete diagnosis with monitoring of the skeleto-dental morphological changes during active period of growth. Growth modifications are done while the forces of growth are still at the peak of activity in a developing child. This study was undertaken on lateral cephalograms of 100 North Indian samples in the age group of 9-12 years consisting of 50 males and 50 females divided into normal occlusion and malocclusion groups, to predict and assess age by evaluating the skeleto-dental morphology in developing normal children having flush terminal plane molar relationship and children with developing class II pattern. It was concluded that based on measurements used in the study of dentofacial morphology, the age of a child could be statistically determined.","1353":"Cephalometric Norms from forty South Kanara children were selected and it was found that these children have a tendency towards class II skeletal relation. Females showed a protrusive Maxillary and Mandibular base. Certain new landmarks were also introduced, the value of which gives the molar relationship. Length of Maxillary and Mandibular bases were also standardised for class I cases.","1354":"The need for dental treatment in paediatric dental patients is immense. The present study was carried out in fifty children in the age group of five to ten years of age with recurrent episodes of dentoalveolar infection. Advanced pulpal infections led to torsion in 54 percent, premature eruption in 46 percent, crater like bone loss in 36 percent, sequestration and dilaceration in 10 percent and 6 percent respectively. Most of the developmental disturbances could have been avoided with timely antibiotics and endodontic intervention.","1355":"Craniofacial clefts are very rare and manifest in a variety of patterns. Tessier classified these clefts in 1973 and numbered them 0 to 14. Tessier No. 4 Facial cleft is a rare variant of craniofacial cleft. Not more than 50 cases are reported in world literature, amongst which only 5 cases are true bilateral in nature. However, combinations of two different variants are not very uncommon. A case of male Indian child aged 4 years with a true bilateral Tessier No. 4 Facial cleft is reported. He also had anophthalmos of the left eye. This is probably the first case in which true bilateral Tessier No. 4 Facial cleft with anophthalmos of one eye is noticed.","1356":"India, a developing country faces many challenges in rendering oral health needs. The majority of Indian population resides in rural areas, of which more than 40% constitute children. These children cannot avail dental facilities due to inaccessibility, financial constraints and stagnation of public dental healthcare services. This entails the health professional to adopt a more practical approach to achieve primary prevention of oral diseases. The most viable solution seems to be dental health education. Documented evidence shows that teachers and parents can augment dental health behaviour. With this background, it was decided to target children in a rural area for comparing the effect of education on children alone, children coupled with teachers and children with the involvement of their parents. An interventional study of 4 months duration was conducted on 430 children, 7 teachers and 100 parents. The parents were educated at home. Clinical oral health status was assessed prior to the delivery of dental health education and also following the intervention. Results showed that the dental health scores improved best in the group of children involving the teachers. It was concluded that teachers could be targeted in order to enhance the effect of dental health education campaigns on children.","1357":"A case of fourteen year old healthy girl with complaint of a discharging sinus on the lower right side of face is reported. All teeth were vital and there was no evidence of periodontitis. There was no history of extraction of a tooth. Total leucocyte count, differential leucocyte count, fasting blood sugar, chest x-ray and routine urine examination were within normal limits. Actinomycosis and scrofuloderma which simulate such a condition were ruled out by culture study. The intraoral periapical x-ray of mandibular molar showed questionable periapical changes at the time of presentation. But definite osteolysis was observed in the repeat radiograph after three months. It was decided to extract the second molar and curette the sinus tract. The extraction proved to be difficult. On examination of the extracted tooth, it was found that the mandibular second molar and second premolar were fused together. The radiograph of the tooth taken after extraction showed confluence of the premolar pulp with the periodontal membrane. On follow up, the lesion was found to heal satisfactorily.","1358":"Reattachment of the original tooth fragment to the fractured tooth provides benefits of maintaining the tooth's shape, colour texture and translucency in the restoration. This paper describes fragment reattachment of a non-vital central incisor five months after trauma.","1359":"The treatment planning in mixed dentition period has changed from extraction to non extraction. Any orthodontic treatment must take into consideration the growth trends and the pubertal growth spurt. The two cases presented here were treated during mixed dentition period in different ways: one with fixed appliances and the other with removable myofunctional appliance therapy, with satisfactory results. Hence for a conservative treatment approach, the non-extraction treatment is recommended in mixed dentition period.","1360":"The trend of dental caries in Chandigarh school children over a sixteen year period, studied by almost the same authors and using the same recording criteria of WHO reveals a continuous decline in 12 and 15 year children but a slight increase in the dental caries status of 5-6 year children.

Presented here are two cases of unusual bilateral mesiodens.","1386":"Utilising the Bright Smiles, Bright Future curriculum as modified for India, a trial on its effectiveness was carried out at the Raja Shivaji School in Mumbai, India. Students from the third standard English medium were selected. The teacher training programme utilised a professional educator from the U.S.A. plus other international representatives including India. Prior to the beginning of any classroom instruction, all experimental and control students were scored for plaque. A pretest was also given to both the experimental and control students to measure their knowledge of dental health. At the end of the two month test period all measurements were repeated. The curriculum was evaluated by the teachers. Parents were also interviewed. Results showed significant (P &lt; .0001) difference between the two groups in reducing plaque, which demonstrated the improvement in oral hygiene in the experimental group.","1387":"Management of root fracture of mandibular lateral incisors during mixed dentition with developing crowding in a ten year old boy by bilateral surgical extraction. Migration of permanent canine into the extracted region of lateral incisors was favourable with minimal spacing in between the rest of the teeth. The near normal parallel position of the roots of the permanent canines was achieved by early treatment planning of extraction of the lateral incisors instead of treating by other modalities which have a poor prognosis.","1388":"Six cases of asymptomatic dental twinning anomalies in the primary dentition are reported in 4205 school children. A clinical and radiographic presentation of the cases of fusion of primary incisor teeth is illustrated. This clinical entity has been found to appear with varied clinical and radiographic appearances. An association of fusion of primary incisors with the number of succedaneous teeth was seen.","1389":"In this era of preventive dentistry, a galore of dental materials used for prevention of dental diseases is available. Since the last few decades efforts are being directed towards prevention of dental caries which is one of the major dental diseases tormenting mankind. The rationale of using a fissure sealant is that when it is applied on the caries prone fissures, it penetrates these pits and fissures and seals them from the oral environment. One of the main problems usually encountered is retention of the sealant material. This study was undertaken with the aim to evaluate the tensile bond strength of two new fissure sealants using invasive and non-invasive techniques. The results substantiated the use of invasive techniques over non-invasive techniques and resin sealants over glass ionomer sealants.","1390":"This survey was carried out among 2902 children aged between 5 and 12 years attending 13 primary schools in various areas of Moodbidri, in Udupi district. The oral health status was assessed using the simplified WHO Oral Health Assessment Form. The caries prevalence was found to be 76.9%. The mean DMFT was 0.78 and the mean deft was 3.48. Although the mean DMFT score between males and females did not show any significant difference, the mean deft was found to be higher among males compared to females. It was also found that the mean DMFT score increased with age whereas the mean deft score decreased with age.","1391":"The strength of Indian society lies in its social, cultural and religious infrastructure. This feature needs to be utilized for appropriate intervention in life styles of people for effective prevention of dental diseases, all of which are dependent, on life style, to a large extent.","1392":"A Paediatric dentist may be the first person consulted for professional advice concerning children with speech problems. A positive significant relationship has been hypothesized by some authors between tongue-thrust swallowing and articulation disorders in children. This study was undertaken to find out whether any articulation disorders are associated with the habit of tongue-thrust swallowing, or is it the type of anterior bite that plays an important role in the normal or abnormal speech production in tongue-thrust swallowers. Forty subjects with tongue-thrust swallowing in the age group of 7-16 years were examined. Of these 20 had normal anterior bite while rest had anterior open bite. A word articulation test was used and word level articulation testing was done for initial, medial and final positions. The sounds tested were: Linguoalveolars, Labiodentals, Linguodentals, Linguopalatals, Bilabials and Linguovelars. The results of the study have indicated that the presence of articulation disorders is strongly associated with the anterior open bite present in tongue-thrust swallowers but a simple, direct relationship between the presence of defective consonant sounds and tongue-thrust swallowing has not been found.","1393":"When the normal physiological process of deciduous tooth exfoliation and eruption of its successor is disrupted, a series of changes are observed in the dental arches. The aim of the study was to evaluate the amount of changes in arch length after the premature loss of deciduous molars. The sample consisted of 82 children, 53 without premature loss and 29 with premature loss of either deciduous first or second molar or both, unilaterally. A reduction in arch length was observed both in the maxilla and mandible at the molar region and an increase in arch length at the canine region in the mandible. Reduction in arch length was due to mesial migration of the molar and the increase in arch length was due to the distal migration of canine. It was seen that arch length reduction was more in maxilla as compared to the mandible and that distal drifting of canine was observed only in the mandible.","1394":"The prevalence of dental caries among rural school children (688 boys and 331 girls) in the age group of 12-16 years in Haryana was found to be 39.4%. It was 37.9% in boys and 42.6% in girls. The difference between males and females was statistically not significant. A significant increase in prevalence of dental caries with age was observed (i.e. 33.1% in 12-year-old children to 45.8% in 14-year-old children). The mean DMFT per child was found to be 1.03 and DMFT per affected child was 2.6. The mean of D, M and F was found to be 1.0, 0.03 and 0.0 respectively.","1395":"Supernumerary or extra teeth result from disturbances during the initiation and proliferation stages of dental development. Teeth formed in excess of the normal number are termed supernumerary teeth. A supernumerary tooth may closely resemble the teeth of the group to which it belongs i.e. molars, premolars or anterior teeth or it may bear little resemblance in size or shape to the teeth with which it is associated. Discussed here are reports of three cases with multiple supernumerary teeth in the mixed dentition and its management.","1396":"The aim of the study was to determine the degree of caries prevalence in the permanent dentition and the accompanying fluorosis in children between 6-16 years of age in both low (0.5 ppm) and relatively high (1.2 ppm) fluoride areas. In 3605 children in a low fluoride area (Dharwad), the mean DMFT was 0.65; 77% of the children were caries free. Grade I fluorosis (using Dean's fluorosis inded) was observed in only 0.66% of the children. Among 3618 children of similar age groups, living in high fluoride areas (Gadag), 84% were caries free and the mean DMFT value was 0.39. Varying degrees of fluorosis were present in 57.07% of the children. The results of the study suggest a definite relationship between the amounts of fluoride ingested through water and caries experience observed in the population.","1397":"Talon cusp is an anomalous structure resembling an eagles talon which projects lingually from the cingulum area of an incisor. It is a rare anomaly which is commonly seen in maxillary incisors. This paper is a report of a case of Talon cusp associated with cross-bite and partial anodontia.","1398":"The study was carried out with the purpose of evaluating the prevalence of dental caries, in semi urban school children. The sample comprised of 415 school going children. DMFT\/dmft scores were recorded as per WHO 1987 criteria. Mean DMFT was found to be 0.17, 0.06 in male and female children at 3 to 6 age group which increased to 1.21 &amp; 1.10 in males and female in 9 to 12 year age group. Mean dmft at 3 to 6 years was 1.36, 1.17 in male and female children which further increased at 6 to 9 years in both sexes but in the 9 to 12 year age group the value decreased to 1.48, 0.87 in male and female children respectively. The entire sample showed a dental caries prevalence of 58.1. It was noted that the children brushed once a day with toothpaste and toothbrush. Complete oral rehabilitation was undertaken through an incremental school health care programme.","1399":"This case report presents a patient with Leopard syndrome, with multiple lentigines all over the body and face, ocular hypertelorism, delayed secondary sexual characteristics, mild cardiac abnormalities and supernumerary teeth. Clinical relevance of this syndrome lies in its early recognition and precautions to be taken during any invasive dental procedure, which if not performed under antibiotic prophylaxis and premedication, could lead to infective endocarditis. Additionally, a multidisciplinary approach with pediatric and medical consultants is mandatory during the management of such cases.","1400":"The effects of variation in the timing of palatal repair on articulation skills in complete cleft lip and palate was evaluated from fifty subjects. The present study confirmed that development of articulation was similar in the groups operated upon before 24 months and between 24 to 36 months. The insignificant difference suggests that articulation was good irrespective of the early or medium timing of palatal repair.","1401":"The present case of a ten year old boy with craniofacial dysostosis with the features of midfacial hypoplasia is a disease known as Crouzon disease. This disease is characterised by cranial deformities, facial malformation, eye changes and occasional other associated abnormalities. The aim of this case is to discuss the clinical, radiographic features and management of the problems.","1402":"An in vitro study was carried out on 40 periodontally involved, caries free human maxillary and mandibular molars to evaluate shear bond strength of resin- modified restorative glass-ionomer cements to dentin. Teeth were divided into four groups, Group I--Fuji II (Conventional glass ionomer) Group II (Fuji II LC), Group III (Vitremer), Group IV (Geristore). Shear bond strength was tested using a transaxial testing machine. Results showed that shear bond strength of all resin-modified restorative glass-ionomer cements was higher than conventional glass ionomer (Fuji II) tested. No statistical difference was found between Fuji II LC and Geristore. However, bond strength of Vitremer was lower than Fuji II LC and Geristore but higher than Fuji II.","1403":"Presented here is a case report of a congenital granular cell tumor commonly known as congenital epulis. It has been found to be ten time more common in females as compared to males. The most common presenting problem is that of difficulties in feeding and respiration. Surgical excision is indicated in case the above problems are present. In the absence of any respiratory or feeding difficulties it is advisable to wait for spontaneous regression.","1404":"The main objective of endodontic therapy is complete obturation of the root canal system after it has been adequately prepared and sterilised. A wide variety of root canal sealers are available for obturation of the root canal system. A number of different invitro methods have been used to evaluate the sealing ability of endodontic filling materials. By combining one or two tests it may be possible to obtain information about sealing ability of the test material. Therefore, the present invitro study compared the sealing ability of three different root canal sealers, namely Sealapex, AH-26 and ZnOE by two different methods, bacterial leakage and dye penetration. The results showed that AH-26 has the maximum sealing ability followed by Sealapex and ZnOE.","1405":"A thirteen-year-old boy was examined in the Department of Pedodontics during a school-screening programme. On examination the left mandibular first permanent molar was found to be grossly destroyed. On radiographic evaluation a radio opaque screw shaped foreign object was seen in the pulp chamber of the said tooth. Retrieval of the foreign object was tried but the attempt was unsuccessful and an extraction was planned. A case of a unique foreign object in the pulp chamber of the tooth is reported.","1406":"An endodontic perforation interferes with the principal goal of sealing the root canal system. An in vitro study was conducted on comparative efficacy of three materials-Dispersalloy, Cavit and Prisma VLC Dycal when placed in lateral root perforations in cervical third areas. Root canals were prepared and irrigated thoroughly. Perforations were made with No. 2 round bur and sealed with Dispersalloy, Cavit and Prisma VLC Dycal. Dispersalloy Group I showed best sealing ability. Prisma VLC Dycal Group I too was comparable to Dispersalloy Group I in its sealing ability, followed by Cavit Group II, Prisma VLC Dycal Group II, Dispersalloy Group II in that order. Cavit Group I was least effective in sealing perforations.","1407":"Compound composite odontoma, is a tumor formed by the overgrowth of transitory or complete dental tissue, made up of one or more rudimentary teeth. Although odontomes are considered to be quite common of odontogenic tumors, these rarely occur solely in primary dentition. This paper is a report of case of a compound composite odontoma, five year old child who presented to the Department of Pedodontics and preventive Dentistry, College of Dental Surgery, Manipal.","1408":"Dental caries is one of the commonest of all dental diseases and is the main cause of loss of teeth in young people. It is a common belief that the high caries susceptibility of occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth is directly related to the morphology of the pits and fissures. Occlusal fissures are deep invaginations of enamel, they can be classified into V-type: Wide at the top and gradually narrowing towards the bottom U-type almost the same width from top to bottom. I-type an extremely narrow slit IK-type extremely narrow slit associated with large space at the bottom Y-type wide at the top and suddenly narrowing towards the bottom.","1409":"Presented here is a case of 7 years 6 month old child with an apically impacted mesiodens in relation to the developing root of right upper central incisor. The removal of mesiodens was deferred in order to avoid disturbance in the natural development of the upper central incisor. Serial X-rays are presented and case is discussed.","1410":"The science of bite mark analysis is relatively new and potentially valuable. This science has been greatly used in identifying the suspects involved in crimes related to sex, child abuse, and altercations of various types. Child abuse is presenting a serious social problem with global dimensions, which is increasing at an alarming rate in all socioeconomic strata and all ethnic or racial communities. The aim of the present study was to assess these bite marks and analyze the effectiveness of a simple technique used in the department of pedodontics and preventive dentistry, College of Dental Surgery, Manipal.","1411":"Supernumerary teeth are among the most significant dental anomalies affecting the primary and the permanent dentitions. Mesiodens is a supernumerary tooth with a cone shaped crown and a short root. Though it occurs frequently in the permanent dentition, it is extremely rare in the primary dentition. The exact etiology is still obscure and not well understood. Supernumerary teeth occur as isolated dental findings or as part of a syndrome. The frequency with which supernumerary teeth occur and the effects they have on development of normal occlusion justify the radiographic examination of preschool children. Early removal of such teeth is recommended if they impede the eruption of adjacent permanent teeth, appear inverted or rudimentary, associated with certain pathologic conditions or are symptomatic.","1412":"A pilot study was carried out in five mandibular primary molars using calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) Paste as root canal filling material to find out an alternative to the routinely used zinc oxide eugenol (ZnOE), which is non-resorbable and causes deflection of succedaneous teeth. The six month clinical and radiographic follow-up carried out at 2 months interval, revealed that the treated teeth with Ca(OH)2 as root canal filling material were successful, showing no pain and tenderness to percussion. A tendency for decrease in size of radiolucency was seen. Two teeth showed complete healing of the periradicular radiolucency. Depletion of Ca(OH)2 paste was seen from the root canals even prior to physiological resorption of roots in 2 out of 5 treated teeth.","1413":"An epidemiological survey of the prevalence of dental caries and treatment need in the powerloom township of Bhiwandi revealed a prevalence level of 56.93%. The overall mean DMFT score was 1.25 +\/- 1.34. Decayed teeth accounted for the largest component of the reported DMF teeth followed by an almost equal proportion of missing and filled teeth. Single surface restorations were the most frequent type of treatment required, followed by the two or more surface restorations, extractions and pulp therapy.","1414":"The present study was conducted to assess the effects of mouth breathing, lip seal and upper lip coverage on gingival health of children. 240 school children aged 10-14 years were selected irrespective of sex race and socioeconomic status. They were divided into two major groups i.e. mouth breathers and normal breathers. These groups were further subdivided into six sub-groups or categories on the basis of lip seal and upper incisor coverage. Gingival index was found to be higher in the mouth breathers than in the normal breathers in the subjects with incompetent lip seal. Increased lip separation and decreased upper lip coverage were all associated with higher levels of Plaque index and Gingival index. No statistical difference existed between mouth breathers and normal breathers with respect to Plaque index.","1415":"This comparative investigation was carried out to evaluate the remineralization potential on early artificial carious lesions under Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) of a Mineral enriched mouthrinse and a fluoridated dentifrice using an in-vivo intra-oral removable appliance model. This findings revealed that the remineralization was found to have occurred in almost all the samples (in children) using non-fluoridated, fluoridated dentifrices as well as those using mineral enriched mouthrinse. However the qualitative analysis of the remineralization revealed that in case of non-fluoridated dentifrice group, the prismatic holes showed deposition of granular, variable sized particles with uneven distribution, while in fluoridated dentifrice group, deposits were found to have partially but more densely filled up the prism cores. In case of mineral enriched mouthrinse group these deposits were found to be in the form of amorphous globular precipitate.","1416":"Four materials viz. zinc oxide-eugenol, iodoform paste, Kri paste, Maisto's paste and Vitapex (Calcium hydroxide + iodoform) were tested for their antibacterial effect against the aerobic and anerobic bacteria, viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and mixed bacterial culture; obtained from infected non-vital deciduous anterior teeth. The antimicrobial sensitivity was checked on BHI-agar plates using well method. The results showed that all the 4 materials were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. Maisto's paste was invariably the superior most in its antibacterial efficacy (in comparison to all the 5 micro-organism strains). Iodoformized zincoxide eugenol appeared to be the second best followed by Kri paste. Vitapex showed the least antibacterial activity.","1417":"A female patient aged 10 years reported with an intra oral swelling on the labial aspect of 32 &amp; 33, appearing to originate from the marginal gingiva &amp; interdental papilla. The swelling was pedunculated, mobile, non-tender, firm in consistency with an irregular surface. The colour of the gingiva was normal with slight ulceration. The swelling was excised &amp; diagnosed histopathologically as peripheral cementifying\/ossifying fibroma.","1418":"Primary school teachers of Udupi municipal corporation were surveyed to determine their knowledge, attitude and practice toward dental caries and periodontal disease prevention. Fourteen schools were selected by cluster sampling and the teachers working in these schools were included in the sample. The questionnaires were completed by one hundred teachers. The results showed that school dental health services must compulsorily hold demonstrations or lectures on prevention of oral diseases during school feasts and parent teacher meetings, in order to involve the teachers and parents in oral health promotion of the child.","1419":"Enamel consists mainly of inorganic material (96%) and only a small amount of organic substance and water (4%). The inorganic material is similar to apatite. The originally found apatite mineral remains basically unchanged except at the surface in contact with the oral tissues, where diffusion processes operate. Enamel reflects the trace element environment present in the tissue fluids at the time of tissue development. These are variations of types and concentration of inorganic elements found in permanent and deciduous enamel. Variations are also seen in sound and carious enamel.","1420":"A case of cherubism in a 9 year old boy with no familial history is presented. Clinical features, histologic appearance, radiographic findings, differential diagnosis and rationale for treatment is discussed.","1421":"A representative sample of 817 Tibetan school children aged 7 to 17 years of Mysore district were examined for malocclusion, gingival bleeding and calculus, using plane mouth mirror, sickle explorer and periodontal probes, under natural light. A very slight increase in malocclusion was noted in school girls, in addition to the statistically significant increase in gingival bleeding among 8-13 years and 17 year old girls and 7-10 years and 15-16 year old boys. Moreover, a highly statistically significant increase in calculus was perceived amongst girls. The present study thus showed an increasing demand for preventive and therapeutic dental treatment in these children and early identification of such individuals at risk, can lead to better disease management.","1422":"Saliva is rich in calcium and phosphates, facilitating remineralization of early carious lesions. There is evidence that remineralization is associated with an increase in the size of enamel crystals and a consequent increase in resistance to caries. The contribution of sucrose to the implantation, colonization and metabolic activities of cariogenic bacteria has been clearly established, and has led to the search for sucrose substitutes. Recent report from Australia and the United States of America have reconfirmed the safety and efficacy of fluoride in preventing dental caries. The use of fluoride in various forms thus remains the cornerstone of most caries prevention programme.","1423":"The present study was carried out on 40 municipal school children in the age group of 12-14 years to evaluate the effectiveness of daily supervised rinsing with specially formulated alum containing mouthrinse on plaque and gingivitis inhibition. The results of this 2 week study demonstrate that a mouthrinse containing 0.02 M Aluminium has significant effect on plaque inhibition. There was a reduction in gingivitis but it was not significant statistically.","1424":"Fusion of teeth results from abnormal events in the embryologic development of teeth. In most cases the clinical and radiological findings allow only a presumptive diagnosis to be established since the specific terminology described refers to the etiology of the process, which often cannot be established. An unusual case of bilateral fusion in primary mandibular incisor region in a four-year-old boy is reported.","1425":"A three-year-old boy reported to the Dept. of Pedodontics with the complaint of swelling in the lower left side of the mouth. The radiographic and histologic study revealed the case to be a complex odontome which is rare in deciduous dentition.","1426":"An eight-year-old girl was referred for the management of recurrent bleeding from the lower, left gingival region and a diffused swelling on the left side of her face. Doppler study and carotid angiogram were suggestive of an arteriovenous malformation. Segmental mandibular resection was performed after ligation of the left external carotid artery. Post-operative period was uneventful and there has been no recurrence of the lesion till date.","1427":"The purpose of present study was to compare the effect of 15 seconds &amp; 60 seconds of etching of young permanent teeth in vitro with 50% phosphoric acid gel using scanning electron microscope. 25 pairs of enamel surfaces selected for the study were divided into 3 experimental groups. The control group consisted of unetched enamel surfaces. In Group II, the effect of 50% phosphoric acid gel was compared with 37% phosphoric acid solution for 15 seconds whereas in group III, the effect of 15 seconds &amp; 60 seconds of etching with 50% phosphoric acid gel was compared. The degree of etching pattern was evaluated by using scoring pattern from 1-3. Results showed no significant difference between the etching pattern obtained with the use of 37% solution and 50% gel for 15 seconds. But it was observed that etching with 50% for 15 seconds resulted in equal or even an enhanced etching pattern as compared to the pattern obtained in 60 seconds with 50% phosphoric acid gel.","1428":"A study was conducted using dermatoglyphics to predict and compare Class I, Class II, div. 1, div.2 and Class III malocclusions. A total of 96 subjects were divided into 3 malocclusion groups, i.e. Class I (control group), Class II, div.1, div.2 and Class III (experimental group) in the ages of 12-14 years. The dermatoglyphic findings revealed that the craniofacial Class II, div. 1, div.2 pattern was associated with increased frequency of arches and ulnar loops and decreased frequency of whorls, whereas in Class III, there was an increased frequency of arches and radial loops with decreased frequency of ulnar loops. In predicting Class III malocclusion, based on frequency of arches, the sensitivity values were found to be higher and more reliable than the sensitivity values of Class II, div.1 and div.2 malocclusion.","1429":"A three year old female child was brought to the Department of Pedodontics, Dental College, Thiruvananthapuram with a greyish white papillomatous lesion involving a large area on the buccal mucosa. VDRL was positive for the little girl as well as her father and was positive in low concentrations for her one-month-old sister as well as her mother.","1430":"The present study was carried out to evaluate the Al, F, Na and Sr release profiles of conventional and resin modified glass polyalkenoate cements in neutral (deionized water) and acidic medium (lactic acid). Twelve pellets of each material were prepared under standardised conditions and were immersed in their respective solutions for a study period of 90 days. Fluoride analysis was carried out by Orion Electrode and the other elemental analysis were done by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the Al, F and Na release profiles between the two materials in both neutral and acidic media.","1431":"An in-vitro study was carried out on 80 human premolars to study the use of Nd:YAG laser as a potential alternative for acid etching in the surface treatment of enamel prior to sealant application. The determination of bond strength using Universal Testing Machine, Model 1011 and marginal leakage using the spectrophotometric dye recovery method showed no statistically significant difference between the groups with laser and acid surface treatments. But, there was a significantly lower bond strength and increased dye penetration in the group with no surface treatment. Scanning electron microscopic study of the interface between sealant and enamel surface of the acid and laser treated specimens was also carried out.","1432":"Fluoride dentifrices are well accepted for their caries preventive effects. Although it is generally accepted that the presence of fluoride in the enamel protects teeth against carious attack, at the same time, there is some concern that ingestion of fluoride from toothpastes may substantially contribute to the total intake of this element. The present study was undertaken to clinically evaluate the fluoride uptake by human enamel after the use of lower concentrations of fluoride dentifrices and compare their potency to higher concentration in increasing the uptake of fluoride by enamel. Enamel biopsy was conducted on first permanent molars of 100 school children, aged 6-8 years before brushing and at intervals of one hour, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks following brushing with different concentrations of fluoride dentifrices. The fluoride content of the enamel biopsy samples were estimated using the Orion microprocessor ion analyser and by taking into consideration the enamel biopsy mass and depth of the etch. The results of the present study suggest that low fluoride concentration dentifrices provide similar fluoride uptake by enamel when compared with that of higher concentrations.","1433":"Amalgam remains unchallenged as a posterior restorative material. But its inability to bond to the teeth leads to some amount of microleakage at the restoration-tooth interface with associated problems such as post operative sensitivity, pulpal complications etc. Also a broken amalgam restoration requires replacement which will further weaken the tooth structure. Recently, 4-META has been introduced which can graft amalgam and composite to enamel, dentin and old amalgam restorations. In this study, the bonding and marginal sealing abilities of 4-META was assessed both at the tooth-amalgam interface and old amalgam fresh amalgam interface.","1434":"Dentigerous cysts arising from overlying infected predecessor teeth are very rare. This report describes one such case where extraction of the infected deciduous tooth with marsupialization led to the eruption of the premolar. Periodic radiographic evaluation is required to note and prevent recurrence and other serious complications arising from these cysts.","1435":"Fifty repaired complete cleft lip and palate cases (38 UCLP and 12 BCLP) in the age of 6 to 14 years were evaluated for sagittal craniofacial morphology using lateral cephalograms. A total of twenty three measurements (19 angular and 4 linear) were used in the analysis to represent a comprehensive pattern of dento craniofacial morphology. The results of comparison between UCLP and BCLP revealed differences for only the skeletodental and interincisor sagittal relationship (greater retroclination in BCLP group).","1436":"The present study, performed in-vivo, included 30 infected primary teeth in 26 children in the age group of 3-8 years. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two obturating materials, zinc oxide-eugenol and Maisto's paste, in infected primary teeth. 30 teeth were divided into two groups of 15 teeth. Teeth in Group I were obturated using zinc oxide-eugenol and those in Group II were obturated using Maisto's paste. On clinical evaluation, teeth obturated with Maisto's paste showed 100% success. Five teeth that were overfilled with Maisto's paste showed complete resorption of excess material within 3 months while the two teeth overfilled with zinc oxide-eugenol showed incomplete resorption of the excess material even after 9 months. Zinc oxide-eugenol treated cases showed only 26.7% bone regeneration while in case of Maisto's paste, it was 93%. Complete healing of the inter-radicular pathology was seen with Maisto's paste. However, the pathology was present in 40% of the zinc oxide-eugenol treated teeth even after 9 months. Maisto's paste was thus seen to be superior to zinc oxide-eugenol both in clinical as well as radiological evaluation, done over a period of 9 months in relation to bone regeneration, healing of inter-radicular pathology and resorption of excess material.","1437":"A ten-year-old girl was referred for the management of a recurrent lobulated mass present in the upper anterior region. Histopathological investigations were suggestive of capillary hemangioma. Surgical excision of the lesion was performed and postoperative recovery was uneventful.","1438":"The use of the laser in improving acid resistance of tooth enamel has captured the imagination of most researchers. Man's susceptibility to dental caries presents itself as one of the most complicated problems to solve. The carbon dioxide laser at a wavelength of 10.6 microns is highly efficient for dental purposes as this wavelength is close to optimum absorption of dental enamel. A study was carried out using a pulsed carbon dioxide laser to find the effects of laser beam on human tooth enamel in an energy range of 2-20 J\/cm2 at a pulse rate of 5 Hz. The effective resistance to acid was determined by wet chemical analysis whereas superficial changes seen on the surface were determined using the scanning electron microscope.","1439":"Specimens of human enamel were treated topically with 2% sodium fluoride solution before and after laser irradiation. The samples were examined using wet chemical analysis and SEM. The results showed that samples treated with neutral 2% NaF after irradiation caused a remarkable increase in acid resistance of the enamel, while samples treated with neutral 2% NaF before irradiation showed a lesser effect. The results were consistent with observations made by using wet chemical analysis and SEM findings.","1440":"The occurrence of a congenital cleft palate greatly impedes the habituation of efficient deglutition of an infant, causing aspiration of fluids in the air passage which may lead to complications like bronchopneumonia and infection of the airway and lungs. Inadequate nourishment due to difficulty in feeding affects the health and acts as a stumbling block in the milestones of normal development. Severe nutritional deficiencies further complicate surgical closure at the right time. A palatal obturator given to the infant effectively separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity and is of great help in feeding till the defect can be surgically repaired.","1441":"50 cases of natal and neonatal teeth were studied at Seth G. S. Medical College and K.E.M. Hospital in order to find out its most common location, sexual predilection, occurrence etc. The cases of natal and neonatal teeth usually report to the hospital due to difficulty in suckling, ulceration to the breast nipple and fear of aspiration of the teeth.","1442":"A study was carried out in urban Calcutta and rural Belur (outskirts of Calcutta) amongst 9600 children in the age group of 6 to 14 years. It was seen that the prevalence and severity of dental caries was higher among children in urban areas whereas the oral hygiene levels were poorer among children in rural areas. It was also observed that rate of dental caries increased with age. Organised efforts are a must to prevent and control dental caries before it takes its toll with disastrous results.","1443":"The study attempts to show a number of variations in the root canal morphology of permanent mandibular first molar. The presence of variations increases the chance of failure of endodontic treatment. Knowledge about internal anatomy of the teeth is very essential for a favourable prognosis.","1444":"Toothbrush contamination during the procedure of brushing was assessed at different time intervals of usage. A peak value of 100% contamination was found at 1 month interval. Hence, a method suggesting disinfection of the toothbrush was employed by comparing the effectiveness of various disinfecting solutions available in the market so that, the brush does not become a source of potential pathogens.","1445":"Caries activity tests are an essential part of any programme concerned with the study or treatment of dental caries. Most of the caries activity tests require expensive kits or specially prepared media or facilities for incubation which limits their use in clinical practice. The present study sample consisted of twenty five children with dental caries and twenty five controls, free of caries, gingivitis and other oral ailments. The test is simple and consists of rinsing the mouth with 10 ml of sterile milk, 3 ml of which is mixed with 0.12 ml of 0.1% methylene blue dye and observed for colour change. The present study demonstrated the potential uses of this test in a pediatric dental clinic setup.","1446":"The present study was carried out to assess whether the remineralization of artificial caries like lesion by artificial saliva can be improved by daily 5 minute treatment in a specially formulated remineralizing solution containing Ca, P, Zn, Sr, F. Extracted human premolars were dipped for 24 hours in artificial saliva and subsequently daily for 5 minutes in the remineralizing solution for 3 weeks. Lesions were assessed using transverse microradiography, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results showed that remineralization by specially formulated solutions repair the enamel lesion and enhances the salivary remineralizing potential.","1447":"Forty-seven children afflicted with acute leukemia were studied at the Tata Memorial Hospital Bombay to record the occurrence of oral manifestations prior to and during chemotherapy. Lymphadenopathy was the most frequent single finding suggestive of leukemia during head and neck examination. Gingival abnormalities, bleeding gums and oral mucosal pallor were the other findings on initial oral examination. Due to immunosuppression caused by the chemotherapy drugs oral mucosal ulcerations, uncontrolled herpes, candidiasis and pseudomoniasis were observed.","1448":"Fifty patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in the age group of 5-20 years were assessed for oral candidal carriage state and other related oral manifestations. The control group showed 16% Candida carrier state, whereas the IDDM group showed 92% candida carrier state. The candidal count was significantly higher in the IDDM group. Other associated oral manifestations like dry mouth, burning sensation, and painful fissures were also observed in the IDDM subjects.","1449":"","1450":"The study was conducted among 50 children in the age group of 8-9 yrs. to evaluate the anxiety producing dental procedures in the dental operatory viz. waiting at the reception area, examination in the dental chairs, scaling, polishing, cavity cutting, injection, extraction and post extraction period. The pulse rates were very high during local anaesthesia, extraction, waiting at reception and examination. A significant correlation was observed between the pulse rate and blood pressure.","1451":"This study was conducted to compare the tensile bond strength at the two interfaces of the \"sandwich technique\". 48 hours after the specimens were tested, using Hounsfield tensometer. Load was gradually applied on to the specimen till the bond at the interface failed. The load at which the bond failed was recorded and analysed for statistical significance. From the present study it can be concluded that the bond between glass ionomer and dentine is better than the bond between glass ionomer and composite resin.","1452":"The first radiographic appearance of adductor sesamoid bone of thumb is considered reliable and is the most commonly used indicator of puberty growth spurt. The purpose of this study was to find out whether the tooth mineralization stage\/stages were as reliable an indicator of puberty growth spurt as the adductor sesamoid bone. Puberty assessment has its necessary application in diagnosis, treatment planning of various malocclusions and in medico legal cases. The results indicated that a close relationship existed between tooth mineralization Stage G and appearance of the sesamoid bone. Hence it can be used in dentistry as an indicator for onset of puberty growth spurt via periapical or panoramic radiographs. The result of this study were not applicable to boys as the apical closure of these teeth had already occurred at the time of early radiographic appearance of the adductor sesamoid bone.","1453":"The present study was carried out to assess the oral health status of children suffering from different handicapping conditions studying in various schools of Bombay. A total of 593 handicapped children in the age group of 12-14 years were included in the study. The prevalence and severity of dental caries was found to be highest in the cerebral palsy group and lowest in the blind group. In general, in all the groups the decayed (D) component took predominance over the missing (M) and filled (F) components. Periodontal status was assessed using the CPITN and it was found that the bleeding &amp; calculus components were higher than the healthy components in all the groups and almost all the children required treatment in the form of deep scaling and\/or prophylaxis and oral hygiene instructions. The study confirmed the need of curative and preventive services towards these neglected children of the society.","1454":"An in vitro analysis of fluoride in the surface enamel using x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy carried out on sound untreated teeth, sound teeth treated with neutral NaF and acidulated NaF and teeth with artificial caries treated with NaF and acidulated NaF revealed Ca\/F ratio at surface and 360 degrees A as 0.140:1 and 0.140:1; 0.636:1 and 0.192:1; 1.112:1 and 0.908:1. 1.2:1 and 1.289:1; 2.11:1 and 1.87:1 respectively.","1455":"The knowledge about infant dental care (as a part of primary preventive programme) was delivered by the existing health team of CHC viz. medical doctors, multipurpose workers, health workers, Anganwadi workers (ICDS scheme), after due training from the dental experts, in the rural community of Raipur Rani (Haryana). The knowledge of community regarding infant dental care subsequent to intervention strategies when evaluated and compared to baseline values three years after intervention revealed that 72 percent of the community had the correct knowledge of prolonged breast\/bottle feeding causing nursing bottle caries. 94 per cent had correct knowledge about harmful effects of thumb\/finger sucking on teeth and jaw bones and 77 percent about harmful effects of mouth breathing. 98 percent of expecting mothers knew when to clean the gum pads and 62 percent how to clean the gum pads in an infant. 100 percent of the expecting mothers had the correct knowledge that pacifiers should not be used in small children.","1456":"The survey carried out on 201 infants of Calcutta aged 6-12 months to find out the localised disturbances associated with the eruption of the primary teeth, as judged through a questionnaire revealed that the most common disturbance was the inflammation of gums followed by flushing of cheeks, ulcers in mouth, cheek rash and eruption cyst.","1457":"The study was carried out on 60 school going children (dft\/DMFT 2-5) aged 8-13 years randomly distributed into six age groups of ten subjects each. One group acted as a control in which subjects rinsed with 10% sucrose while in the other five groups, the subjects rinsed with 5 commonly prescribed syrup medications for 10 seconds. Plaque samples were collected before rinsing and at 5,10,20,30 min. intervals post rinsing and plaque pH was measured extraorally. All the 5 groups showed drop in the plaque pH, similar to control group 10% sucrose solution, but not to the extent of critical pH (5.5).","1458":"Forty-five children in the age group of 2-12 years comprising 20 well-nourished (W.N.), 20 malnourished (M.N.) (both groups having DMFS of &gt; or = 5) and 5 caries free well nourished children (control group) were studied to find out the oral microflora in these groups S. mutans was present in 55%, 20% and 0% in W.N., M.N., and control groups while S. Salivarius was isolated in 45%, 80% and 40% in the three groups respectively. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of Lactobacillus and C. albicans in the three groups. The correlation between means DMFS and the prevalence of S. mutans in W.N. and M.N. groups was highly significant (P &lt; 0.001). Nutritional status including different grades of malnutrition had no significant bearing on the prevalence of micro-organisms isolated. The caries prevalence was higher in the W.N. group (P) while the gingival index was higher in M.N. group.","1459":"The expression and distribution of keratins within different layers of enamel organs of embryonic and neonatal rats studied by using indirect immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescent techniques in paraffin-embedded tissues employing specific antibodies revealed Keratin positivity in odontoblastic layer, oral epithelium and dental lamina in primitive stages; other odontogenic tissues showed negative reaction.","1460":"","1461":"The occlusal status was assessed in 2015 Libyan children. Angle class I was found to be the predominant type (94.5%), overbite relationship in the majority (50.6%) were within the incisal third. The mean overjet measurements ranged from 2 mm. to 8 mm. Small proportion (13.4%) of the children examined were assessed to have a signs of crowding. Only 18.7% of the children were found to require orthodontic treatment. Eruption of permanent teeth was earlier in girls than in boys. The interval of rest between the mandibular lateral incisors and canines was 2.68 years for boys and 2.76 years for girls.","1462":"Cariogenicity of five commonly consumed carbonated beverage and sugar containing drinks (Frooti, sugarcane juice, Limca, Thumps up and Big Sipp) was evaluated by estimating changes in pH of human dental plaque and saliva in 2 groups of subjects (20 each) differing in caries experience (Group A DMFT zero; Group B DMFT 3-5). In group A subjects, pH of plaque did not fall to levels near critical pH (5.5) with any of the test drinks or control. However, in group B children the salivary pH did fall below critical levels in the case of Frooti while salivary pH fell below critical pH with Frooti and Thums up.","1463":"An in vitro study was carried out on 60 human pre- molar teeth to study the sealing efficacy of Glass Ionomer, Silver amalgam, Composite resin and cavity varnish in Class V cavities. The filled specimens were thermocycled (4 degrees C +\/- 2 degrees C and 60 degrees C +\/- 2 degrees C) and subjected to Radio Isotope penetration tests. S35 was used as a tracer and autoradiography for detecting the microleakage. The extent of penetration of S35 in case of each material was assessed. No material was found to completely seal the cavity, however, Glass Ionomer could minimise the microleakage. Amalgam restorations exhibited gross microleakage which reduced to a great extent after application of cavity varnish. Composite resin was found to be superior to Silver amalgam in controlling microleakage.","1464":"The natal, neonatal and early infancy teeth predominantly being of the normal series of primary dentition, the management should aim at preservation of these teeth for esthetics and maintenance of space for eruption of permanent successor. The treatment method should take into consideration (a) trauma to child's oral tissue or mother's breast (b) mobility and (c) danger of inhalation. Trauma was noted in 10 percent, mobility and danger of inhalation in 94 percent. Extraction carried out in 97 percent of 50 children with natal\/neonatal\/early infancy teeth showed that the neighbouring primary teeth tended to move into the extraction space. Eruption of the permanent successors to natal\/neonatal teeth was not delayed, rather in some instances the eruption was found to be enhanced as compared to contralateral incisor as noted in unilaterally occurring natal\/neonatal teeth. The mandibular anterior arch collapse was not permanent as the successors erupted uncrowded. The paper discusses the method and timing of extraction. From the immunological and hematological point of view the best time for extraction was calculated to be 7-25 days of birth.","1465":"A study conducted on 120 primary molars (30 each of maxillary and mandibular 1st and 2nd molars) to find out the prevalence, location and patency of accessory canals and furcation formina using safranin red dye revealed the presence of accessory canals in 46 teeth (38.33 percent) with the major site being the furcation and furcation region.","1466":"A total of 1042, 3-14-year-old children with different types of handicapping conditions when recorded for dental caries using WHO 1987 caries recording index revealed that dental caries experience was higher in handicapped children than normal children. The prevalence of dental caries was highest in mentally retarded children followed by cerebral palsied, blind, epileptic, physically handicapped, children with Down's syndrome and deaf and dumb. Higher deft+DMFT was recorded in mandibular teeth compared to maxillary teeth.","1467":"A three and half year old boy with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH) formerly called as eosinophilic granuloma has been presented along with the desired treatment plan.","1468":"","1469":"An epidemiological survey of dental caries using modified Moller's index (1966) carried out in 483 children (aged 7-17 years) of rural areas--Talwandi Kalan, Dhanansu and Bhatian (District Ludhiana) of Punjab with almost similar F levels in their drinking water supply, similar socio-economic status, environmental factors\/demographic parameters and dietary habits revealed wide variations in the prevalence and severity of dental caries. Further investigation extended to evaluate the concentrations of various trace elements Se, Li, Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn in drinking water to find out the disparity of dental caries status, revealed that the higher figures of prevalence and severity of dental caries observed in Dhanansu and Bhatian as compared to Talwandi Kalan could be attributed to the presence of Se in drinking water supply of these areas which was not detectable in the water supply of Talwandi Kalan. On the contrary, the concentration of Li in water supply of Talwandi Kalan with low caries was found to be higher compared to that of Dhanansu and Bhatian with higher dental caries in children population.","1470":"The study was conducted on 25 healthy women residing in optimum fluoride areas, who were to deliver normally through vaginal route, to correlate the maternal and cord plasma fluoride levels and evaluate the placental transfer of fluoride. A wide variation was found in the maternal and cord plasma fluoride levels. In only 8 percent of the cases the fluoride levels in cord plasma were higher than maternal plasma. It was deduced that the placenta allows passive diffusion of fluoride from mother to foetus and does not act as a barrier.","1471":"This study is a part of a larger preventive oral health feasibility module embarked on a population of 120,000 of Raipurrani, district Ambala (Haryana). The KAP analysis of about 2000 individuals (including school children) on cross-sectional basis at baseline, one and two years after the implementation of knowledge about oral health measures to the community utilizing the existing health infrastructure at CHC, the Anganwadi workers (ICDS Scheme) and through school teachers in the schools revealed that at baseline datun was the most prevalent (63%) oral hygiene measure used in the community and students. After implementation, the practice of brushing thrice, twice and once daily increased but the most prevalent frequency remained once a day (39% out of 66 percent using brush in community and 37% out of 76 percent in students after 2 and 11\/2 years of implementation respectively) followed by twice a day (23 &amp; 31% respectively). A similar pattern of frequency was observed about datun users also, though the number using datun substantially declined from 62% to 33% in community and 63 to 23% in students after implementation.","1472":"An epidemiological study on interrelationship between dental caries and sugar consumption conducted on 1265 children in the age of 5-15 years revealed a positive association of dental caries experience with total sugar exposures, between meal sugar exposures and at meal sugar exposures. As the total increased from 3 to 4 in a day, a corresponding jump of 1 deft+DMFT and 2 defs+DMFS was noted, which was clinically and statistically significant. It was deduced that total sugar exposures per day should be limited to 3, out of which two should be at meal time and one between meals.","1473":"The prevalence study of thumb digital sucking carried out on 3-12-year- old 2517 children, 1293 boys &amp; 1224 girls, with different socio-economic status, belonging to villages, suburbs and city areas of Calcutta revealed that non-nutritional sucking habit was predominantly seen in cities, and bottle feeding was found to be the main cause of this habit; in 3-6-year-old children the prevalence of the habit was more in boys than girls but it persisted more in boys with increase in age.","1474":"26 healthy children between the ages of 36 and 60 months (mean 35 months) who satisfied the selection criteria during a screening visit participated in this double blind study. The subjects were assigned randomly to receive either 75 mg\/kg Triclofos elixir (Regimen I-21 children) or 50 mg\/1kg Trichlofos elixir combined with 1 mg\/kg promethazine elixir (Regimen II-22 children). All medications were given orally 45 minutes before treatment. During operative procedures all subjects received nitrous oxide\/oxygen at a concentration of 35%. All the patients were restrained in a papoose board (Indigenous). The subjects were monitored for vital signs and evaluated for sedation and sleep, movement, crying and overall behaviour before, during and after the operative procedure. Regimen II was found to be superior to Regimen I with regard to behaviour management of difficult young children. However extremely apprehensive children were not good subjects for this sedation technique.","1475":"The present study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of taurodontism and pyramidal molars in Goa children, hitherto considered rare in Indians. Radiographs of 300 children of 9 to 13 years were evaluated. The criteria of Keene (1966) was used to designate taurodonts. Ten children showed taurodontism: involving mandibular second molars in eight cases, maxillary first molars in three cases; and pyramidal molars in three cases, four cases showed associated findings. Hypodontia of one to fourteen teeth was observed in all four cases. In addition one case showed thinning of maxillary central incisors, rotation of lateral incisors, impacted supernumerary and a canine and polydactyly of hands and feet. The condition does not appear rare in this population group.","1476":"Dentigerous Cyst, in a young patient, located in the right palatal region, extending from 61 to 55, limited to the right side of mid-palatine suture and treated by marsupialization with post operative follow-up of 6 months has been reported. The involved permanent tooth (21) entrapped in the cyst was not extracted and found to erupt in normal direction.","1477":"","1478":"The in-vitro study undertaken on sixty teeth, 30 each of second primary molars and first premolars to evaluate the effectiveness of sealing property of composite-ionomer laminate restorations given on buccal aspects of these teeth after either Dycal base, ionomer base not etched and ionomer base etched indicated significantly more microleakage in dycal base composite resin restorations than composite ionomer. No difference in microleakage was seen in etched and unetched composite ionomer laminate restorations. Though microleakage was observed more in primary teeth than permanent teeth it was not found to be statistically significant.","1479":"An in vitro study was conducted on 78 sound human pre-molars collected from low (0.24 ppmF), optimum (0.7 ppmF) and known endemic fluoride areas (&gt; 1.5 ppmF), to study the effects of topical application of sodium fluoride and APF-gel on surface microhardness of enamel of these three areas using Vickers microhardness measurements before and after application of topical fluorides at time intervals of 1\/2 an hour, 6 hours and 24 hours. It was found that both the topical fluorides increased the surface microhardness of enamel in the three areas; the maximum increase in surface microhardness was observed in fluorosed teeth. APF-gel was found to be more effective than sodium fluoride.","1480":"Thirty 'apexified' immature permanent anterior teeth treated utilising Ca(OH)2 as root canal dressing assessed clinically and radiographically after greater than 6 less than or equal to 12 years revealed that in 15 teeth bridge remained the same; in 10 consolidated, while in 3 it decreased. Periapical radiolucency reappeared in one case, while in two it was questionable but clinically the teeth were comfortable; these cases were ones showing decrease in bridge consolidation: two teeth had been extracted during this observation period by some dentists because of complaint of discolouration.","1481":"A roentgenographic cephalometric investigation to establish Steiner's norms in pre-school children was carried out on 60, 4-5-year-old North Indian children with complete normal established primary dentition and pleasing profiles. The North Indian children were found to possess a convex profile, steeper occlusal plane, steeper mandibular plane and more upright incisors over basal bone at 4-5 years of age as compared to that of Caucasian children. None of the measurements showed sexual dimorphism of any statistical significance. The Steiner's norms from a sample of Caucasian population are not as such applicable to North Indian pre-school children.","1482":"The study was conducted on 1251 6-12-year-old children, to evaluate the effect of topical application of NaF, APF and Duraphat given at six monthly interval assessed after 2.1\/2 years revealed the percentage caries reduction with sodium fluoride to be in the range of 20-24 percent on base line teeth and 30-33 percent on teeth erupted during study, showing more effect on newly erupted teeth. In APF group, the caries reduction was 32-37 percent, in the DMFT and DMFS-slightly more on teeth erupted during study than on baseline teeth. The dental caries reduction with Duraphat (NaF varnish) was in the range of 70-75 percent-slightly more on newly erupted teeth. Equally high degree of efficacy was also noted on occlusal surfaces. Duraphat showed the greatest public health potential.","1483":"Cariogenic potential of a few children's favourite snacks, assessed by evaluation of pH modulations on their respective consumption after 2,5,10,20,30 and 40 minutes compared to 10 percent sucrose control using pooled plaque method, in 8-12 years old children revealed lollipop (hard sucking candy) to be the most cariogenic and samosa without chutney to be the least cariogenic. The cariogenic potential of ice creams were similar, however, low as compared to sucrose solution of 10 percent.","1484":"Dental casts, wrist roentgenograms and full mouth radiographs of teeth of 80 mal-nourished and 40 well-nourished children were evaluated and compared for correlation of dental, skeletal and chronological ages. The findings revealed (1) very high correlation between dental and skeletal ages (r = 0.9584); (2) high correlation of chronological age with dental and skeletal ages (r = 0.8635 and r = 0.8716); (3) out of all the three correlations considered, dental and skeletal ages had the maximum correlation; (4) malnutrition had a significant adverse effect on the skeletal and dental ages. Greater the severity of malnutrition, more pronounced was its effect on the dental and skeletal ages; and (5) no evidence of severity of malocclusion with retarded skeletal and dental ages.","1485":"Forty cleft cases in the age range of 5-12 years where the palatal repair had been performed at 16-24 months (17 cases), 24-36 months (15 cases) and 36-72 months (8 cases) were assessed retrospectively, for the status of maxillary arch and were segregated as acceptable and unacceptable. Plaster casts were prepared from alginate impressions and their graphical reproduction using Huddart's technique, were used to measure the alveolar arch. Anterior palatal measurement (C-C') and posterior palatal measurement (P-P') of the cleft subjects were compared with that in the non-cleft matched controls. The 16-24 month group showed 41.2% acceptable and 58.8% unacceptable arch cases. The 24-36 month group showed that 73.4% had acceptable arches and 26.6% had unacceptable arches. In the 36-72 months group the arch was acceptable in 62.5% cases and unacceptable in 37.5% cases. It was concluded that palatal repair performed before 24 months of age adversely affected the maxillary growth, whereas most favourable growth of maxillary arch occurred when the repair was done between 24-36 months.","1486":"The number and configuration of root canals in mandibular first permanent molar, studied by radiographic method, on 60 teeth revealed (1) one canal in the mesial root in 5 percent, two in 78.3 percent, three in 13.3 percent and four in 3.3 percent. In distal root, one canal was observed in 58.3 percent, two in 40 percent and three in 1.7 percent of the cases; (2) transverse anastomosis existed in about half of the mesial roots; whereas in distal root, it was only 21.7 percent; (3) biconvex canal curvature was seen in 18.3 percent of mesial and 1.7 percent of distal roots (4) apical foramina: in mesial root two apical foramina were observed in 60 percent of specimens, three in 6.7 percent and four in 3.3 percent. In distal root, two apical foramina were seen in 25 percent and three in 1.7 percent cases; (5) type of root canal: type 2-1 was the most common feature of mesial as well as distal roots; (6) the mesial root canals tended to be curved in 51.7 percent, while distal root canal straight in 58.3 percent.","1487":"","1488":"Dental caries was recorded using WHO index (1983) and Moller's index (1966) in 1265 children in the age group of 5, 8, 11 and 15 years to determine the conversion and correlation figures, so as to facilitate cross comparison and quick appraisal where either of the systems have been used in epidemiological studies. The results revealed that dental caries was recorded higher with Moller's index as compared to the WHO index; on an average the difference was fourteen percent in point prevalence, one deft + DMFT and one and a half defs + DMFS.","1489":"Prevalence study on dental caries and periodontal disease carried out in 94 mentally subnormal, 92 physically handicapped, 74 juvenile delinquents and 206 normal children (11-14-year-old) revealed high prevalence of periodontal disease in handicapped (95 to 100%) and low in normal children (54.37%). The point prevalence of dental caries was higher in normal children (84.9%, DMFS 6.19) followed by juvenile delinquents (75.67%, DMFS 4.3), physically handicapped (73.91%, DMFS 4.3) and mentally subnormal (64.9%, DMFS 4.48).","1490":"Fifty repaired complete cleft lip and palate cases (38 UCLP and 12 BCLP) in the age range of 6 to 14 years were evaluated for transverse and vertical asymmetry using postero-anterior cephalograms. A total of nine bilateral landmarks, representing upper face, mid face and lower face were used. Results showed that asymmetry was not confined to any single plane of reference but manifested in both dimensions--transverse and vertical. The UCLP group had greater asymmetry of mid face than the BCLP group. Asymmetry was found to be extending to distant areas besides the contiguous structures.","1491":"The evaluation of the levels of mutans streptococci have been used for many years in some countries, in clinical work to monitor patients during treatment of dental caries, based on the observations that teeth, and patients, with elevated levels of mutans streptococci are at higher risk for caries. Other studies have focussed on attempts to select high caries risk groups based on salivary levels. Several methods to estimate the bacteria have been developed, among them being the \"Spatula method\" and the more recent \"Strip mutans\" method. Both methods are based on observations made in studies aimed at determining factors of importance for the transfer of these bacteria between persons. This paper gives a background to saliva sampling for mutans streptococci and describes some studies that have evaluated the role of these bacteria for caries. Such background information is important for the correct use of bacterial tests in the clinic and for interpretation of the results.","1492":"An in vitro study conducted on 30 primary second deciduous molars and 30 second premolars to evaluate the tensile bond strength of composite ionomer restorations revealed that (i) glass ionomer cement base was superior than Dycal under composite restorations; (ii) etched glass ionomer base provided optimal bond strength in both primary and permanent teeth; (iii) tensile bond strength was high in permanent than in the primary teeth; and (iv) composite ionomer laminate can be considered as a material of choice for restoration of primary teeth.","1493":"The acidogenic potential of commonly consumed solid sweets in Karnataka viz. Peda, Laddu, Mysore Pak and olige, studied in 40 children (9-15 years) with 2-5 dift\/DMFT using glass electrode attached to Analog type pH electrometer revealed the mean resting plaque pH for 'peda' group to be 7.05, 'laddu' &amp; mysore pak groups 7.24 and olige group 7.44. The maximum pH fall was obtained at 10 minutes interval in the post consumption period. It reached 6.08 with Peda, 6.44 with laddu, 6.41 with mysore pak and 6.47 with olige. The plaque pH gradually rose towards neutral in about 60 minutes in the post consumption period. According to cH area, the lowest acidogenic potential was found with olige (7.0506), followed by laddu (7.562), mysore pak (11.6944), and peda (15.249).","1494":"A case of gingival fibromatosis with hypertrichosis is reported in a 10 year old girl. The condition is a syndrome and presents as a triad of gingival fibromatosis, hypertrichosis and mental retardation. Following surgical management, no recurrence was seen in the immediate post-surgical period. Even if recurrence occurs excision is recommended as the psychological benefits resulting from cosmetic improvement outweigh the danger of recurrence.","1495":"The KAP survey on oral health practices of 3247 individuals, 6-60 years of age, of Sidhaura block of Haryana revealed that use of dattan was more prevalent (56% in adult community &amp; 49% students) than tooth brush (35% adult community &amp; 34% students). 37% of the total community had the knowledge of brush being the best oral hygiene measure. 25% of the community using brush were brushing only once\/day. The knowledge of the community regarding the role of fluorides in prevention of dental caries was completely lacking: 1.8% of the community was using fluoride dentifrice. 35-45 percent of the community were practising sweet foods\/drinks etc. four times a day. The snyder test showed a positive relation with frequency of sugar intake.","1496":"The study carried out on 30 teeth in 28 patients of 12-16 years to assess NaF iontophoresis as an alternative to cavity lining revealed that out of 25 cavities which were sensitive to air, water jet and exploration (14 mild, 9 moderate and 2 severe), in 20 cavities the sensitivity decreased to nil, in 9 to mild and in one to moderate following iontophoresis. It was found that in all the cases, the first application of iontophoresis decreased the sensitivity by 50-60 percent and the second by 70-90 percent. Immediately after silver filling there was no sensitivity in 25 teeth, whereas 4 were mildly and one moderately sensitive. After a six month follow up in 24 patients who reported, all the teeth were comfortable.","1497":"Iodoformized zinc oxide-eugenol was tested for its antibacterial effect against the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria obtained from the root canals of deciduous teeth; the bacteria were staph aureus, strep viridans, strep faecalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus and also mixed culture obtained from infected non-vital anterior teeth.
